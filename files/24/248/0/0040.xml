O.P. 104 (34).SECRETPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1934.CABINET.MY colleagues will desire to give careful study to this formidable judgment on Germany&apos;s intentions from the pen of the Permanent Head of the ForeignIT may perhaps be asked whether the Defence Requirements Committee, in its recent report, was justified in taking Germany as the ultimate potential enemy. It is possible that such doubt may be entertained, if no opportunity has been given to see as a whole the evidence on which such a conclusion is based; and this paper is written to supply that deficiency. It does not, of course, give the whole of the evidence; for that would necessarily include a continuous and daily stream of German oration, broadcast, literature and teaching. It gives, however, a section sufficiently complete and convincing for its purpose. In order to arrive at any conclusion as to Germany&apos;s future, it is necessary, of course, to review briefly her spirit in all its aspects and directions, and not merely to confine ourselves to the points (e.g., the colonies or Locarno) at which we are most liable to have trouble with her ourselves.The introduction shall be short. The origin of the war of 1914, in its simplest expression, was the use made by Germany of her military power to threaten the independence of her neighbours. The German adapted to this policy, besides his militarism and his ambitions (&quot; Weltmacht oder Niedergang &quot;), had been trained to &quot;a fine natural savagery,&quot; which we thereafter all forgave, and almost forgot, for the sake of peace. The collapse of Germany was, moreover, so tremendous that the consequences of her acquired and fostered characteristics were obscured by the spectacle of her humiliation. Irritation with France led easily to the assumption that the revolution of 1918 had changed the fundamentals of German policy and German training.There was never the slightest warrant for these assumptions, and they were not shared by anybody who knew or lived in Germany. These were, however, the years of myth, when Stresemann passed for &quot; a good European &quot; (i.e., in modern German eyes, &quot; a bad German &quot;)- -before his correspondence with the ex-Crown Prince revealed him as pursuing a policy differing little in essentials from the policy of the Third Reich or of the Hohenzollerns. So, also, Treitschke and the renegade Houston Chamberlain differ only in degree from the racial, or tribal, ferocities of the Nazi doctrines.  Even Bruning, in the methods of his attemptedOffice.J.

/hschluss,&quot; was true to former type. The war, in fact, made no real change HpFthe German spirit, which is indeed a continuity. Tt will be instructive to hear, ryery briefly, our successive Ambassadors at Berlin on these post-war years.Lord LVAbernon, 1925: &quot; The German of to-day is still something of an anachronism. Over and above the atavistic instincts of the race lies the age-old habit of mercenary military service, of internecine and, finally, of foreign war, reinforced by an education and a code of honour adapted deliberately to the military ideal. ... It is thus not astonishing that there are in this country great numbers of ordinary mankind excellent husbands and fathers of family  who can think of foreign politics only in terms of war the natural and honourable prerogative of man and who cannot conceive future frontiers otherwise than on the time-honoured scale of batteries and battalions.&quot; And he adds, in a significant sentence, that it is &quot; an extremely virile and determined race smarting under the reproach of insuccess not of defeat.&quot;Sir Ronald Lindsay, 1927 : &quot; The average German .... considers the argu-ments in favour of peace advanced by his former adversaries as sheer hypocrisy. . . . He feels that the miseries which he has endured arose not from the war itself, but from the fact of losing it; and he would very much like to win the next war in order to be in the enviable position of retrieving his losses and of revenging himself for his previous misfortune. . . . There is a general suppressed tendency to think the exact contrary to that which the British public believes, namely, that a fresh war might do some good and cannot, in any case, do much harm. Now there are two facts in connexion with the German character upon which the builders of theories can count as a sure foundation for conjecture, and these are, firstly, that the German&apos;s meekness decreases in proportion to the increase in his moral prosperity and material well-being &quot; (vide Sir E. Phipps later), &quot; and, secondly, that, given the impetus of discipline and organised method, he becomes aggressive. . . . The &apos; Einheitstaat &apos; would lead to a Prussianisation of Germany, and a Prussianised Germany in turn means an aggressive Germany, since it would constitute a. mere return to type.&quot;We may note the last sentence in regard to what I have said of continuity; and on the subject of Prussia, General Goering avows in the spring of 1934 that Herr Hitler &quot; has recognised the spirit of Potsdam and has reaffirmed it&quot; We must also recognise that the &quot;Einheitstaat&quot; is now an accomplished fact; the Federal States have practically disappeared. The Reichstag is no longer an active force; the Opposition political parties and newspapers have been eliminated; &quot;the political conception which created the Weimar Constitution has been consigned with execration to oblivion&quot; (Sir E. Phipps, March 1934); the Nazi SA. have been incorporated into the State; the party is the State; propaganda and wireless have been nationalised, and religion is being nationalised. Even Sir R. Lindsay, when he prophesied danger, had probably not foreseen that unification could go so far. He adds in another despatch : &quot; The ultimate objective of German policy is naturally and inevitably the removalof the more galling consequences of defeat.....The Polish Corridor, the&apos; Anschluss,&apos; Silesia, perhaps even the Colonies, will all be attacked in their turn.&quot;Sir Horace Rumbold, early 1933: &quot;The present German Government have to rearm on land, and, as Herr Hitler explains in his memoirs, they have to lull their adversaries into such a state of coma that they will allow themselves to been gaged one by one.....Since he assumed office, Hitler has been as cautiousand discreet as he was formerly blunt and frank. It would be misleading to base any hopes on a serious modification of the views of the Chancellor and his entourage.   Hitler has, of course, sufficient meed of cunning to realise thenecessity for camouflage.....   Protestations of peace on the lines of the chancellors Potsdam speech are likely.....   I have the definite impression that a deliberate policy is now being pursued. The aim of this policy is to bring Germany:to a point of preparation, a jumping-off point from which she can reach solid ground before her adversaries can interfere.&quot; . Again, just a year ago, Sir. H. Rumbold wrote : &quot;Not only is it a crime to preach pacifism or condemn militarism, but it is equally objectionable to preach international understanding.&quot;Sir E&apos;; Phipps, end of 1933: &quot;It will, in my opinion, be essential that Herr Hitler shall not be allowed to derive the impression that he can drive a wedge between&apos; Great Britain and France.&quot; (Cf. Sir H. Rumbold above.) &quot;It will continue to be to the common interest of both those PoAvCrs, despite frequent
differences of method, to avoid offering Germany any undue temptation to add yet another chapter to her already all too lengthy war history.&quot;In January 1934 Sir E. Phipps wrote : &quot; Nazi Germany believes neither in the League nor in negotiation .... Germany&apos;s foreign policy may be said to comprise the following aims : (1) Fusion with Austria; (2) rectification of the eastern frontiers; (3) some outlet for German energy to south or east; (4) the recovery of some- colonial foothold overseas. .... A new political bloc of Germans, Austrians and scattered Teuton elements is to be established in the centre of Europe. .... The new German people will be trained on radical mines. Its mode of life will be Spartan, and it will be so fanatically patriotic that when the day comes &quot; (we heard of The Day often before 1914)  &apos; germany will only have to shout and the walls of Jericho will crumble.....   when germany is rearmed and feels secure from foreign intervention, it will be possibleto take in hand the programme outlined above.....For the moment Germany&apos;desires peace, for the reason that she is not prepared for war.....   Later shewill presumably demand the territorial revision of the &apos; unjust &apos; peace treaties also as of right, and will hope to secure these desiderata by peaceful means or at all events by the threat of force. If these methods fail, and the &apos; just &apos; claims of Germany should lead to war, the blame will be laid on her enemies, with the same passionate conviction as the blame for the last war is laid to-day on the Powers, whose jealousy, it is sedulously suggested, encompassed the encirclement and destruction of the German Empire.&quot;The reports of our successive official representatives are borne out by a series of confidential and independent reports. I quoted one of them in a memorandum of last August informing us that &apos;&apos; there is no doubt whatever of the ultimate intentions of Germany.&quot; It will thus be seen that, while there is continuity in the German spirit, there is an equal continuity on the part of our represen-tatives in warning us against it: &quot; In the place of the men of Weimar, there are now men whose ultimate aims are much the same, but whose radically different methods may at some future date precipitate an international conflict.&quot;It may well be, however, that, in a matter of such importance, some are not content to be guided by the word of our successive representatives in Germany. They would like to see some of the facts on which those views are based Let us, therefore, listen to the Germans themselves beginning with the official ones- -who, as I pointed out last year, are giving us more specific warnings than ever we had before 1914.I have already alluded to StresemamVs aims, in 1925, upon Danzig, the Polish Corridor and Upper Silesia. Let us turn to the 1925 edition of Mein Kampf. The foundation of Herr Hitler&apos;s faith is that man is a fighting animal. Pacifism is therefore the deadliest sin. The German race, had it been united in time, would now be master of the globe. The new Reich must therefore include all the Germans in Europe. (This would mean not only Austria, but South Tyrol, Memel, Czechoslovakia, Eupen, Malmedy, Luxemburg, Slesvig, German Switzer-land.) Give the German nation, therefore, 6 millions of young men, perfectly trained by athletics, consumed by fanatical patriotism, educated to the maximum of aggressiveness. Germany&apos;s lost provinces can only be- regained by force of arms. But Germany must not repeat the mistake of fighting all her enemies at once. She must single out the most dangerous in turn, and attack him with all her forces. &quot;It is the business of the Government to implant in the people feelings of manly courage and passionate hatred.&quot; To Hitler militarism and Prussianism are not terms of reproach, but signal titles of honour. It is a matter of naive and implicit faith that the German people are, by this divine and jackbooted means, the predestined rulers of Europe. In time the best of Europe will be peopled and dominated by innumerable and irresistible Germans, who will have settled some old scores for good. Therefore nationalise the masses : only brute force can ensure the survival of the race : the ultimate aim of all education is to produce a German who can be converted with a minimum of training into a soldier.. Nobody who sees inside Germany can doubt that this hatred is really being instilled into every. German from his and her earliest youth.: It is being done directly, i.e., by calculated xenophobia in the case of specific nations, and indirectly, i.e., by the mass suggestion that all but Germans are an inferior breed, a nuisance to be conquered and kept in their proper place; of subordination. Then, as I have seen a Nazi put it, &quot; all the world shall take its sustenance from [9890] b 2
the Being of Germany.&quot; (It may be interesting here to note, on the subject of this superiority-complex, that Houston Chamberlain spent some time, at the beginning of this century, in proving Christ to have been a German. This side of German continuity will be dealt with when we come to the new German religion.) Race, indeed, in Hitler&apos;s pseudo-scientific mind,-is everything; and there is only one race that counts (see below).In 1929, Colonel Hierl, now Chief Organiser of the Nazi Party, published a pamphlet called &quot; Foundations of a German Military Policy,&quot; the substance of which is that war with Germany&apos;s former adversaries &apos; is inevitable in the long run, and that Germany must early set about regaining the necessary strength.  She is now systematically regaining strength (see below).On the 20th September, 1930, the National Socialist Party reissued, with Hitler&apos;s approval, the programme embodying its twenty-five points. The following among them are of interest in connection with Germany&apos;s foreign policy : Point 1 : &quot; We demand the consolidation of all Germans into one great German State by reason of the right of nations to self-determination.&quot;Point 2 : &quot; We demand equal rights for the German people with the other nations, abolition of the Peace Treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain.&quot;Point 3 : &quot; We demand land and territory (colonies) in order to feed our nation and to enable our surplus population to emigrate.&quot; (This must be taken as a conclusive answer to the earlier Hitler, who had his doubts about overseas colonies.)&quot; The leaders promise, if necessary at the cost of their own lives, to carry out the foregoing points regardless of consequences. But our final aim is this : a greater Germany.&quot;Through the years of this stuff, which violent dreams are made on, we come to General Goring at Potsdam on the 10th March, 1934 : &quot; To this German people Prussia is giving the best she has, namely, ethical Prussianism, which is unthinkable without the military spirit, without that combination of virtues which distinguishes soldiers. This military spirit must be firmly founded in the Reich, so that the energies of 66 million inhabitants should be no longer dissipated, but concentrated in one hand so as to operate as a hammer blow.&quot;And on the 19th March Herr Himmler, Chief of the Political Police outside Prussia, declared at Munich: &quot;We shall remain decent and modest soldiers; but one day &quot; (the Day again), &quot; when the leader permits, we shall break loose.&quot;These warnings are not lacking in precision. Pan-German ambitions may not be unnatural; but we cannot forget that when, in the past, Germany had attained a commanding position, she used it to threaten the independence of her neighbours and ultimately our own existence. Nor would the Germans anyhow allow us to forget it, since they themselves proclaim, officially and unofficially, by word and by deed, their intention to &quot; live dangerously.&quot; (Much of their talk of the training and&apos; purposes of a &quot; heroic &quot; nation is a subconscious continuation of Nietzsche and the eighties. &quot; Ye shall love war better than peace, and the short war less than the long.&quot;)It will be interesting to look a little more closely at some of Germany&apos;s aims and professions. The Polish corridor is a particularly interesting example, in view of the recent German-Holish agreement, wherein the initiative appears to have come from Poland, not Germany.The essence of the matter was put plainly by Herr von Schubert (Dr. Stresemann&apos;s man, and therefore of course now dismissed) to M. Zaleski in 1927 : &quot;No improvement in their relations could be expected until Poland had agreed to restore the corridor and a part of Silesia.&quot; More or less the same language was used in 1930 by Herr Treviranus and Dr. Curtius; who were certainly not extremists and who are - now likewise laid aside. In 1931 Sir Horace Rumbold reported that &quot;a war against Poland to rectify the eastern frontiers would be in the nature of a crusade . ... one hears more and more that Germany&apos;s future lies in the east and south-east.&quot; (c/., Herr Rosenberg to-day). And in the same year Herr Seldte, then leader of the Stahlhelm, now Minister of Labour, laid it down that &quot;Germany would never be satisfied unless Poland&apos;s outlet to the sea was blocked.&quot;   It is expected, wrote
our Ambassador, that &apos;&apos; France, having realised that Poland is more of a liability than an asset, will one day stand aside.&quot; In 1932 our Minister in Paris reported that the French Government were asking &quot; where all this would end ? . . . . The next move might well be a violation of the provisions relating to the demilitarised zone; after that it would be the Polish corridor, then Silesia, and finally the colonial question .... Herr von Hoesch &quot; (then Ambassador in Paris) &quot;had, in fact, said as much to them quite openly, and in terms which could only be described as studiedly offensive.&quot;In November 1933 Herr Rosenberg defined a defensive war as one &quot; wagedin defence of men of German blood.....   Thus a war with Poland might be a defensive war, even if Germany were technically the attackers. . ... Germany desired peace, but once she was strong enough would insist that the German minorities in other countries be treated fairly.&apos;&apos;The French are right as regards the demilitarised zone. It is only a question of time, at most until Germany is strong enough to prevent reoccupation, \ before some overt breach of treaty obligations occurs there-:a matter directly concerning this country. Indeed, we have been informed by a despatch from Berlin in the middle of last month that instructions have already been given for field-works to be secretly begun.The most interesting feature of the Polish question is its bearing on Herr Hitler&apos;s pacific protestations, in which Sir Horace Rumbold disbelieved (see above). In justice to Sir H. Rumbold&apos;s judgment, it is to be noted that Herr Hitler recently observed to the Yugoslav Minister in Berlin : &quot; Don&apos;t think that I have forgotten the Polish Corridor.&quot; Let us now hear the echoes of his lieutenants.At the beginning of December Herr Roehm circulated to S.A. leaders a confidential memorandum in which it was said that &quot; the negotiations with Poland merely aimed at a standstill agreement. Germany requires a breathing-space to carry through va,st reforms in the civilian and military spheres. .... All ranks in the SA. are to exert themselves to the utmost to prepare for the day &quot; (again the Day) &quot; when Germany will be in a position to talk in a more energetic manner to Poland.&quot; In January 1934 another leading Nazi explained: &quot; When the propitious moment arrives, Hitler intends to bring strong pressure to bear on the Poles, with a view to revision of the German-Polish frontiers.&quot; That day was to be &quot;when Germany has a sufficiently powerful army.&quot; The same idea lies at the back of their agricultural policy. &quot; In a few years,&quot; says one of its chief exponents, &apos;&apos; the German eastern border provinces will be settled by soldier peasants, and if the Poles prove intransigent, then Germany will be in a position to exert pressure at the right moment.&quot; Almost the same language was used by Herr Rosenberg about the same time. A little later another secret circular was issued to the S.A. : &quot; It is impossible yet to say whether a conflict between the two countries will eventually be unavoidable. Germany can only hope for success if she uses the coming years to make herself the strongest Power in Europe. The military spirit in the S.A. must not be affected by the apparently pacific spirit of Germany&apos;s present foreign policy.&quot;It may be asked how this apparent digression on Poland affects the question whether the Defence Requirements Committee Were justified in describing-Germany as the ultimate potential enemy so far as this country is concerned. The answer, apart from that already given in my memorandum of last August, is two-fold: (1) That, despite agreements or pauses, it is Germany&apos;s eventual aim to execute her full and original programme, which includes points bound to affect us; (2) that Hitler&apos;s pacific assurances must be regarded with scepticism. In further confirmation of the latter statements, I would recall a recent memorandum from His Majesty&apos;s vice-consul at Munich : &quot; I was present at a social gathering when the following statements were made by officers of the Reichswehr. The persons in question were overjoyed to notice that foreigners could be so easily duped by the so-called intensive peace-campaign and occasional peace-propaganda &apos; out of the mouth of the German Chancellor.&quot;Once again it would be difficult to have a clearer intimation than this, which&apos; corresponds with the circulars. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is fully justified in thinking it possible, in his memorandum of the 21st March, that Herr Hitler &quot; probably wishes also to create abroad an impression of the peaceful nature of German foreign policy, and: thereby, if&apos;: possible, further to divide the remnants of the war coalition.&quot;
It may be well to add a few words on the point which more particularly concerns us, the Colonies. It will be remembered that the German Government vigorously claimed during the Peace Conference the return of Germany&apos;s colonial possessions. No German Government has ever abandoned that claim. On the contrary, even Dr. Stresemann informed Sir H. Rumbold, in the spring of 1929, that &quot;he did not wish it to be supposed that he was reconciled for ever to the Loss of the German Colonial empire,&quot; and that &quot;if and when, in his opinion, the moment should come to raise this question, he would do so either through the. German Ambassador in London or through myself.&quot; The activities of the German colonial societies have been growing in intensity year by year. If the agitation is scarcely a genuine one for the German Colonies were never settle-ment Colonies, and German trade with them was only about one-half of 1 per cent, of her total trade, both on the import and on the export side the inference to be drawn therefrom is only the more ominous : it is a question of Machtstellung and prestige. In 1932 Sir H. Rumbold reported that the colonial question was receiving prominence in German official circles such as it had never enjoyed in previous years. He added that &apos;&apos; if Germany can succeed in obtaining the cancellation of the war guilt clause, she will no doubt endeavour to use this moral reinstatement to strengthen her claim to readmission into the ranks of the colonial Powers.&quot; In 1933 we had Herr Hugenberg&apos;s memorandum on this subject which, though withdrawn, had apparently originated with the Nazi Office for Economics. Of the members of the present regime, Herr Hitler, in at least two press inter-views since he assumed office, has indicated very definitely that Germany has by no means abandoned her colonial aspirations; Baron von Neurath has publicly encouraged the activities of the colonial organisations which have been much heartened by Lord Rothermere&apos;s articles and Dr. Schacht has always taken a leading part in the matter. A &apos;&apos; Colonial Commemoration Day &quot; is to be held on the 8th July, 1934, in connexion with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Germany&apos;s first colony. It is to mark the commencement of a new campaign. Here is a cause for increase of bad blood. There are two views now in Germany on the &quot; colonial question.&quot; I think it may roughly be said that the elder party would like to solve it &quot; with England,&quot; and the younger &quot; in spite of England.&quot; But they both want colonies.In regard to German expansionist aims in other directions, I need not here enlarge upon the Austrian question. It has been fully dealt with on other occasions. Its chief interest now is the estrangement which it has caused between Germany and Italy. It is at present impossible to forecast how long this will last, or what its effect will be. Czechoslovakia is obviously threatened. The country is frightened, and Dr. Benes has no policy. Nor has anyone else. There is some doubt as to the exact extent of Nazi example and agitation among the 3 or 4 millions of German Czechs; but the possession of such a minority is a great anxiety to the ruling race. As to Memel, it will suffice to say that, if and when Hitler decides to attempt his forward policy in Eastern Europe, he will probably find Memel the easiest point at which to begin it. The date may even be advanced if he meets with a prolonged check in Austria. In North Slesvig a strong Nazi annexationist campaign is maintained, although there is no sort of doubt as to the predominantly Danish character and inclination of its inhabitants. In Eupen and Malmedy, on the contrary here we are getting nearer home the population is, in fact, predominantly German. If Germany were to conclude a series of non-aggression pacts, these questions would enter into the same category as the Polish Corridor already dealt with.So much for Germany&apos;s foreign politics. I say nothing here of France, because the subject is too large and obvious a one. The same remark applies to Russia, where the establishment of the Nazi Government in Germany and herr Rosenberg;&apos;s schemes of eastward penetration have produced some singular surface changes in regard to her neighbours and the League. These changes are of course due to fear-metu non moribus. France, and M. Herriot in particular, builds too much upon them, from the same motive.It may be noticed, then, that if we have taken Germany to be a potential enemy, we are in the company of most political minds in Europe. Everywhere, in fact, is to be.found the anticipation that, within strictly measurable time, Germany will be practising a policy of blackmail or force.We must next enquire what Germany has been doing to prepare for the Day when it may be possible to put these policies into execution. She has, of course, been rearming energetically, persistently, obviously.    I need not here
describe the extent of that rearmament. It has been dealt with in a very recent memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, CP&apos;. 82 (34).   One or(1) The budgetary law, published at the end of March, and revealed by one newspaper on the eve of extinction, shows large increases in the Army, Navy and Air Votes. Sir E. Phipps reports that it seems clear that Germany intends to take this year the preliminary steps towards achieving her minimum require-ments under a disarmament convention.(2) We know the Germans to have been recently experimenting with the use of poison gas, particularly from aeroplanes; and in this connexion I would recall that disclosures in 1927 showed the Reichswehr to have been playing with a scheme for co-operation between Germany and Russia in the manufacture of poison gas.(3) The answer to the pretext that Germany needs 3 million S.A. and S.S. men of a military value already superior to that of our territorials in order to keep down communism is given in a letter from Sir E. Phipps : &quot; The Nazis play this Communist card ad nauseam. There were about 5 or 6 million Communist votes in Germany out of say 35 million. The tame citizens undoubtedly took them much more seriously than the Governments of Prussia and the Reich, who knew that all their blood-thirsty talk about revolution and retribution meant nothing. The Communists and their fighting organisation, the Rot-Front, did not put up the faintest resistance to Hitler.&quot; Even the Austrian Socialists were more formidable. Many of the German Communists were, in effect, of the radish kind, red without and white within; and there was often change of membership between the Communist and Nazi parties. Germany was &quot;saved&quot; from nothing. If more demonstration were needed, it is supplied by the cringing creatures who went into the witness-box during the Reichstag trial. Such men are not dangerous. In the last few days, too, we have heard of the &apos;&apos; conversion&apos;&apos; of those two prominent members of the former Left, Herrn Lobe and Severing the latter once a &quot; strong &quot; man  &quot; conversions &quot; pitifully like those Russian ones that repeat themselves at intervals in such cases as those of Tomsky and Bukharin and Rykof.(4) The creation of the uniform and bellicose German is completed by the measures taken to pass a rapidly increasing proportion of the youth of the country through the various &quot; Wehrsport &quot; (&quot; Military Sport &quot;) Associations, including the Hitler Youth organisation for boys from the age of 12 who are drilled by older boys in uniform the Labour Corps, and, apart from the Brown-Shirts already dealt with, the new Blue-Shirts or Air-Sport Association. Even the Hitler Youth organisation &apos;&apos; manoeuvre &apos;&apos; in the country, and Wehrsport, according to a report by our military attache of April 1933, includes drill and physical training, field exercises and pack marches, judging distances, miniature rifle shooting, map-reading and compass-marching, sand-table instruction, and tactics. Gelandeubungen, which are also in the curriculum of German youth, include scouting, attack and defence, withdrawal and pursuit,&apos; surprise and ambuscades, the enemy as a rule being designated as either smuggler-bands or Communists. (I have noticed elsewhere that rifle-shooting is now described in Nazi jargon as -&quot;national sport&quot; and history as &quot;national science.&quot;) University students now limited in numbers, for &quot;Mem- Kampf &quot; declares intelligence of secondary importance in the individual and intellectualism undesirable are required to go into camps for drill, and they must take up a six months&apos; course of practical work connected with the needs of the nation at large. &quot; The process,&quot; (of militarisation) wrote Sir H. Rumbold a year ago, &quot; will be applied continuously from the age of 12 till the man becomes too old for service in the field. It will be seen that a supply of instructors and an organisation to handle complete classes of the nation, quite independent of the Reichswehr, have been created. The cumulative effect of these measures will &quot;be to produce a very large reserve of personnel, who will require little further training to take their places in the armed forces of the country on&apos; the outbreak of war.&quot; &quot; -(5) Germany has been placing orders in Denmark for cavalry horses and knapsacks, which indicate an intention to expand her army in any case. Apart from this it is impossible not to notice the swollen purchases of raw material recently made by Germany.   Some of these purchases are accounted for by the
replacement of depleted stocks, but not all. Among the latter (see C.I.D. 1131-B of March 2) is toluol, the basis of T.N.T. Here the creation of a war reserve is obviously being pursued. German imports of nickel in 1933 were larger than in any other post-war year. Some 1,500 to 2,000 tons of this have been absorbed by an issue of nickel coinage; but this creates a permanent reserve of nickel in the country, and is a measure which has been advocated in the German press for this purpose. Sir Arthur Balfour states that, to his personal knowledge, the German Government has purchased, in the last six months of 1933, the total stocks of ores of certain ferro-alloys. In the case of vanadium this amounts to 4,000 tons  more than a normal year&apos;s consumption for the whole of German industry. Sir Arthur Balfour also claims knowledge of an import of 40,000 tons of copper by the German Government in 1933, which would bring its reserve of copper to over 100,000 tons. Sir Reginald Wingate, chairman of the Katanga Mines in the Belgian Congo, confirms that Germany has been the principal purchaser of copper from the Company in 1933. Last summer Sir A. Geddes gave me similar information. Very large recent purchases of scrap by Germany are a feature of the scrap metal market. A British metal - merchant, present in January at German-Dutch negotiations for the purchase of tin, states that one of the conditions of the German representatives was that a year&apos;s supply of tin should be kept in Germany as an emergency reserve. With reference to all the foregoing it should be noted that the Acting British Consul at Pittsburg reports that, while on business in Germany last summer, several industrialists expressed the view to him that, if Germany had had the necessary raw materials for the manufacture of munitions during the past war, her position would have been impregnable. For the next war this position was to be rectified by the purchase of all available scrap.Finally, under this heading, I wrould refer to the latest report by Sir E. Crowe&apos;s Sub-Committee of the C.I.D. (1134-B), which is of such, unquestionable-able significance that I must quote its most important findings. &quot; There is no doubt that, soon after the departure of the Inter-Allied Military Control Commission in 1927, Germany began taking steps to create a powerful armament industry. ...&quot; (I repeat that Germany has always had a consecutive spirit.) &quot; Ever since 1927 the Germans have been engaged on plans for industrial mobilisation, albeit with the greatest care to avoid publicity. . . . The policy adopted appears to be that of evading the Treaty up to the limits of the probable endurance of the other signatories.&quot; (Part of Hitler&apos;s prestige is due to the fact that he has taught Germany that there are no limits.) &quot; Many entirely fresh workshops. and factories have been absorbed into armament pi&apos;oduction. . . . The Germans have created a very comprehensive armament industry.&quot; (It will become the more comprehensive as they secure orders abroad, e.g., in China, as is now happening.) &quot;With regard to chemical warfare, plant exists for the manufacture of military toxic substances. . . . There is no doubt that the German chemical industry is in a position to fulfil all requirements. ...&quot; In regard to the navy, &quot; considerably larger stocks than were authorised of medium and heavy guns, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition have been manu-factured . . . .&quot; (for the army. &quot; Since the advent of the Nazi Government, the capacity of the German aircraft industry has been increased by 50 per cent, in one year. . . . As German industry is controlled by the Reich, Jthe financing of the manufacture of munitions is facilitated, and other nations are precluded from tracing such expenditure. . . . The second foundation of industrial. expansion in an emergency consists of the placing of educational orders with industry in peace. This is being carried out on a preconceived plan. . . . Not only have all types of military aircraft been constructed in series, but plans have been made for their mass production in time of war. . . . Special measures have been taken to expand still further. . . . A number of newr plants have been opened up. . . . Preparation for the manufacture of aero-engines is reported to have begun in certain factories hitherto employed on other work. ... A secret circular shows that the German Government is endeavouring to evolve types of sports and com-mercial aircraft which in time of war may be rapidly converted into definite military aexxmlanes. . . . The expansion of the industry, which is still continuing, is in no sense a natural industrial development. Its justification lies solely in orders placed on behalf of the Reich, or Nazi organisations, for aircraft of these types and for definite naval and military machines. ... A secret governmental technical organisation working under cover of a civil firm A &apos;2l
Fertigung G.m.b.H. (i.e., Preparations, Limited/&apos;- the name at least:is frank  &quot; is arranging for the mass production of military aircraft.&apos; :J. ::; The principle of manufacturing complete component units in different factories ;fOr assembly elsewhere is&apos; even now being applied m the construction of certain&apos; heavy! triple-ehgihed aircraft capable of use as day and night bombing aeroplanes. ;: ..&apos;&apos;&apos;-&apos;No facts- could speak a plainer language; and it may weir be asked why Germany prefers building up munition reserves and making unmistakable preparations for war in all its phases to paying her commercial: debts:&apos; This question takes us-to her financial and economic policy ihits bearing on the conclusion of the Defence Requirements Committee. I will&apos; only touch&apos;.briefly those points of it which plainly bear upon that conclusion.In its broad lines this policy represents rather a development of, than an innovation on, the policy pursued by former German Governments. Two aspects of this policy are of interest to the outside world: (1) Foreign debts; (2) Autarky, or the economic self-sufficiency of the Reich.Before Hitler&apos;s accession, he and his henchmen used to declare, that, while political debts (i.e., reparations) could not be recognised, commercial obligations would be fully honoured. This has not lasted long. A moratorium was imposed by the German Government last summer. Further pressure is to be applied to the creditors this month; and, judging from recent utterances by Dr. Schacht and Herr Funk, the aim of the German Government is so progressively to over-come the resistance of the creditors that, for the sake of peace, they will agree to take nothing or next to nothing. Shorn of all diplomatic phraseology, that is rearmament via fraudulent bankruptcy. It is pertinent to ask why Germany will have twice since the war succeeded in extinguishing her financial liabilities, while at the same time carrying out internal reconstruction and development at the expense of others. As an American creditor has put it: &quot; We have already had the honour of financing the industrial and economic rehabilitation of Germany; we are now to have thrust upon us the doubtful honour of financing also German rearmament.&quot; Germany is, in fact, according to the latest information in my possession, taking a leaf out of the Russian book. She, too, by defaulting on her foreign debts and building up her national economy on an internal currency, counts on maintaining herself and on gradually creating a great military and air force. Foreign investments in Germany (about  750 million) are become hostages to fortune.As to &quot; autarky,&quot; this is no Nazi innovation, but a continuity. Already, under the Governments of Briining, Papen and Schleicher, was begun the endeavour to make Germany independent of the import of foreign food-stuffs. So well were the foundations laid that 1933 was the first year since the late &apos;70&apos;s during which it was unnecessary for Germany to import cereals from foreign countries. This self-sufficiency is to be extended to other spheres of economic national life. Germany has learnt a lesson from the last war, and will be&apos; less vulnerable in future. Autarky, however, must lead first to a lowering of the standard of living in Germany, and then to a cheapening of German goods, resulting in dumping (as threatened by Herr Funk on .the 27th March). This dumping must in turn lead to acrimony and counter-measures, by which the present international situation can only be aggravated.The foregoing relates mostly to official or housetop policy. It is yet more instructive to descend from the housetops and to look inside the houses and their inhabitants. What happens there is the most important matter of all and is also the most ominous of German symptoms. The subject can only be briefly dealt with here; but the random samples submitted are of a kind as plentiful as evidence of Soviet propaganda; anyone can collect more for,himself. We had better begin with the new religion.Herr Rosenberg has been appointed Supervisor of the spiritual education of the entire N.S.DA.P. an appointment not without humour to those of us who have met Herr Rosenberg. The Pope has placed his book.ohsthe Index, and has described these&apos;original tendencies as &quot;a hew view of life.leading away from Christ and back to heathenism . . . . not only a false Christianity, but a real paganism.&quot; This is in great measure true. Something of Christ is to be preserved-how much is not clear hut He is to be endowed jyith more &quot; virility &quot; and compounded with Wotan or some other deadly&apos; .Wagnerian;Gpi^&apos;.i;o become in fact a fighting deity and a pure and heroic&apos;&apos; German (vide Houston Chamberlain above). That word &quot;heroic&quot; is much in the&quot; modem German [9890] c
mouth; and it has been wisely observed in one of our most recent confidential reports that &quot; in the Prussian mentality the terms &apos; heroic &apos; and &apos; aggressive &apos; are practically synonyms. The whole nation is to be unified and standardised into the heroic.&quot; This blasphemous nonsense cannot be disregarded :. Herr Rosenberg is, strangely enough, no laughing matter. The purification of humour does not exist in Germany.In a memorandum which I wrote four years ago for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, I described the Nazis as &quot;ridiculously dangerous.&quot; Said Reichsbishop Muller last February : &quot; National Socialists want to be Christians and to fight as Christians.&quot; The new religion is full of fighting, e.g., God Songs for Germans, a &quot; German &apos;&apos; adaptation of the Psalms in which the author, after repeating that Christ is purely Aryan and that Christianity must be Germanised if Christianity is to be retained, remoulds the deity to a war-god with a preference for Potsdam, and adapts the text to his own brand of general xenophobia. I turn to another book, The Christian Statesman: A Theology of Nationalism. The thesis is simple : Germany is destined to rule the whole world, or, at least, the whole of Europe. &apos;&apos; The German Empire is the pre-condition of the coming of Christ.&quot; &quot; The Germans are the successors of the Romans.&apos;&apos; &quot; The League of Nations is an expression of the decay of the bourgeoisie epoch of the West European race.&quot; There is no equality of nations : &quot;If the Polish nation would put itself on the same level as the German, that would&apos;not be just, but silly. . . . What is not equal has no equality of rights. . . . The German nation must rise, great and outstanding, above the others. . . . We Germans come first. . . . We are not equal to others, we are Germans. . . . Warfare is our art and ruling our profession.&quot; The new God, it is explicitly declared at the end, is to see to this.The neighbours of Germany naturally ask themselves uneasily where these daily doses of religious megalomania are leading. A comparison with Russia is interesting. The youth of Russia has been systematically told (1) that it must have no god; (2) that the outside world is rotten; (3) contradictorily, that in spite of this the outside woidd is on the point of attacking Russia in full force and that youth must be prepared to defend itself. The German youth is being informed (1) that he must have for god a bellicose &quot;go-getter&quot;; (2) that the outside world is rotten; (3) that God prescribes a Holy War in which a race of energumens, per fervid with hate, is to burst out and subjugate these Helot races. And, of course, the Christian Statesman is to destroy France. It can be understood that a resident in Germany recently remarked to me that on these topics &quot;the nicest of her friends seemed to have become a little mad.&quot; Of the two madnesses with method, the Russian is, on form, clearly the less dangerous; and there is, of course, no possible comparison between German and Russian efficiency. This has been recognised in the priorities of the Defence Requirements Committee.Passing now to the subject of general education, we find that Point 20 of the original and notorious Twenty-five Points of National Socialism provides that &quot; the national idea must be inculcated into children as soon as they reach the age of reason.&quot; Dr. Frick, Reichsminister of the Interior, has recently re-emphasised this : &apos;&apos; The national revolution has placed before the German schools a new ideal  -the production of the political being, whose every thought and act should proceed from work and sacrifice on behalf of his nation.&quot; This is being effectively carried out, but a good deal more than the national idea is being inculcated. Let us begin with the teachers. I quote from a Berlin consular report of January 1934. &quot; The twenty-six different teaching principles have been unified in one, viz., to model the German teacher as a Storm Troop leader of the German people.&quot; And Dr. Frick chimes in again that the idea of arms must be impressed on the adolescent, and that open-air exercises must be used as the stalking-horse. &quot; The Nazification of education is proceeding apace,&quot; wrote Sir E. Phrjbps in January 1934. The Statthalter of Saxony explains it: &quot; The German ybuth must receive the education suited to the needs of a heroic nation.&quot; (We have been told what &quot; heroic &quot; means.) School libraries are being cleared; history must be rewritten, says that educational authority, Herr Rosenberg, though the new version will not be available until 1935; the historic students&apos; corps duelling reinstated -are now all drawn into the SA. &quot;German opinion must be moulded into a compact, undissenting mass,&quot; declares Dr. Goebbels. Let us take an example of how this is being done. How is history being rewritten ? What books are replacing those of which the libraries have been &apos;&apos; purged &apos;&apos; ?
As a foreword we should place on record that Hitlerism has been based on nothing but false history; without this conscious distortion it would have been impossible. As Germany is making a religion, so she is making a legend, with its saints and martyrs. &apos;&apos; Unlike other legends, this legend is new and burning and contemporary.&quot; It is built on racialism and xenophobia, and, being thorough, the Germans are making this a matter of text-books and educational method. American text-books were bad enough, but at least they falsified a distant past. In Germany the school text-books have descended to the dangerous type that perpetuates the spirit of the late war.An example, The Awakening of Germany, by Herr von Fikenscher, with appendix by Herr Karl Ruger, is available, a forerunner of the promised flood of 1935. It is published with the warm approval of Herr Schemm, the Bavarian Nazi Minister of Education, and covers the period 1914-33. It is a farrago of falsehood, hatred, hysteria, militarism, revenge for little folks, with illustra-tions, object-lessons and songs, unworthy of notice but for the fact that &quot;this type of teaching is now nation-wide.&quot; I take one children&apos;s song as an example : &apos;&apos; Storm, storm, storm ! Sound the bells from tower to tower, Call the men, the young, the old; Call the sleepers from their rooms; Call the girls down the stairs; Call the mothers from the cradles; The air shall roar and yell; Raving, raving thunder of revenge! Call the dead from their vaults. Germany awake.&quot;When General Goring said : &quot; Already Germany is morally rearmed,&quot; he did not say too much. The voice of the new deity is the voice of the new peda-gogue, as undissenting as Dr. Goebbels could desire. What other country speaks like this ? The Times correspondent-a moderate and balanced critic describes Germany as &quot; the spiritual area of a people who have not yet passed through stages which the Western countries have left behind.&quot; This view accords with that of the Vatican.It is natural here to refer also to the crude ferocities of Professor Banse. who seems to have gone beyond the average German teacher in forgetting that in this new military science 1&apos; special care is necessary in order to know what should and what should not be said.&quot; The quotation is from one of his reviewers, who declares reproachfully that Banse has given the show away. The professor has, however, already received so much attention in this country, that the German Government have nominally but not really- withdrawn two but not all of his books. It is no more possible to withdraw Banse from circulation than it is to withdraw Hitler&apos;s Mein Kampf. Both express the same military philosophy. Both are the representative orthodoxy of the Nazi party. Banse can be easily summarised. His thesis is that of a recent, and repeated, German broadcast under the direction of Dr. Goebbels : Wir wollen die Welt beherrschen, we mean to dominate the world; and here I refer back to the Theology of Nationalism, which I have already quoted. This is but more of the grammar of consent. The professor discards any official pretence that German rearmament is for defence; and he has, of course, with him General von Reichenau, who has recently affirmed that, particularly in the air, offence is the best form of defence  an old saw with a new edge. A few examples of him will suffice : Germany is to be extended &quot;far&quot; beyond the boundaries of 1914; the future wars to this end must include spiritual as well as material preparation (here he links up with the new deity); virile nations must always fight again, particularly when they have lost, and for this the whole people must be mentally prepared, &quot;welded together&quot; to a &quot; feverish mass of blood and iron.&quot; (Compare Dr. Goebbels.) As to education and here he links up with the new pedagogy it is not a question of chunks of knowledge but of &quot;pouring steel into the nerves&quot; of the German people. This, and much more, is presented to the willing public in a strangely inflated, psuedo-scientific style : the new pedagogy has to yet to produce a German who can write prose. The-importance of Banse is not the man or his writings, but that no one can look through the calendars of German universities, or take account of the curricula of high schools, and even the primary schools,[9890] d
without realising that the ideas, the spiritual attitude, of Professor Banse are a normal feature of the new teaching, which the Nazis have introduced as a vital and obligatory part of all German education. Every man in the streets of Germany&apos;s neighbours feels uneasily with the Catholic Bishop of Berlin that &quot; satanic literature is sprouting up everywhere like fungus after rain.&quot; There is but one possible comment on this, and it was made 1,900 years ago. &quot; People who are.fed on this stuff,&quot; wrote Petronius, &quot;can no more be sensible than people who live in the kitchen can be savoury.&quot;The foregoing gives some account of Germany as seen both from without and within, of this &quot; oligarchy under the general supervision of a dictator,&quot; as Sir E. Phipps sums it up. What I have recorded is partly a series of facts. Where I have recorded opinions, they are the opinions of those best qualified to judge. The facts can only be questioned with closed eyes; the witnesses are there to be questioned with eyes open. These facts will be succeeded by other facts, but the conclusions will remain. The evidence at present is overwhelming. There may be a change of heart, although, as I have shown above, the German spirit has been a continuity for the last seventy years since Germany felt her strength, in fact. Such hopes may be entertained; but at best, as in Soviet Russia :&quot; Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem Testa diu.&quot;&quot;The wine-jar will long keep the flavour with which it was imbued when it was new.&quot;Some relaxation in the signs of eventual aggression might emerge from any collision between evolutionists and revolutionists in the N.S.D.A.P., or from a weakening of Hitler&apos;s position due to the disillusionments and internal frictions- economic, ecclesiastical which, according to Sir E. Phipps&apos;s despatches at the end of March, appear to be growing. Fresh waves of revolution are possible; the revolutionists would seem to have slightly the better of the argument so far. Personally, I doubt whether anything much would be gained by a weakening of Hitler on the contrary. No one could foretell any definite gain from a triumph of the &quot;Radicals,&quot; that is, the real National Socialists, who do not think that revolution has gone far enough. It may be so; it may be that these would think as much of social change as of militarism. It is hard, however, to see much peaceful promise in such a Radical as Goebbels or in Ley, Darre, Roehm, leader of the S.A., Himmler, leader of the S.S., Wagner, Schemm, and Frank. Goebbels&apos;s views have already been demonstrated; the calculated tendencies of Darre&apos;s agricultural policy are already known Roehm is frankly brutish. I have shown Schemm to favour the perversion of the young. Frank&apos;s provocative performance in Austria will be remembered. Hess, Hitler&apos;s right-hand man, appears to be doubtful. On the other hand, the Relative Reactionaries, such as Goering, Siebert, Epp, Esser, are sometimes thought to have an understanding with the Nationalists of the old regime; and little more than a year ago we were mostly inclined to consider the Nationalists a greater eventual menace to the outside world than the National Socialists. To take a representative pair, I would consider Herr von bulow, the head of the regular German Foreign Office, more dangerous than Herr Rosenberg, the head of the Nazi Foreign Office (vide the former&apos;s attempt to reinterpret and modify the terms of the agreed summary of the Berlin disarmament conversations). The Nazi revolution was essentially a lower&apos; middle-class movement; the proletariat is not yet fully incorporated. What will be the result when that is achieved 1 The former is, of course, much the more bellicose element. It is difficult, therefore, to see how, out of any internal confusion, any greater assurance to Germany&apos;s neighbours is exactly predictable.It is, therefore, also difficult to see how, on such evidence, the Defence Requirements Committee could have come to any conclusion other than that whereby &quot;we take Germany as the ultimate potential enemy against whom our &apos; long range &apos; defence policy must be directed.&quot; I submit that my colleagues made a fair statement of a situation created wholly by Nazi Germany herself. It is conceivable that Germany may take a turn for the better, when the dust, the shouting.arid parading subside; that:the fever may pass, instead of being endemic as most good judges of Germany suspect. Meanwhile, greatly as convalescence would relieve and delight us, we cannot consider a malady in the light of
13256symptoms which have not appeared. We have to take the Nazi regime as we find it, an established fact. In modern times, when a ruthless regime is once on top,; in. possession of all the superior mechanical devices for destruction and prepared to use them, counter-revolution has a poor chance. Again we may compare Germany with Russia though there is probably more enthusiasm for the German than the Russian oligarchy.I would further submit that we took no immediately alarmist view. According to a recent confidential report, Germany&apos;s evolution will pass through two phases : (1) A phase of internal reform, regrouping of the population, and general training of the race; (2) the expansionist phase, the latter to begin when the &quot; land-hungry &apos;&apos; surplus of agricultural population artificially created requires more land. I interpolate &quot;artificially created&quot; because the German population is not normally increasing in any marked degree whatever. The increase is being stimulated, as in Italy. (A little while ago I came across a book by a German authoress, protesting against the flower-pot position to which a &apos;&apos; heroic&apos;&apos; race was consigning her sex; but even she wandered off into a diatribe on the necessity of conquering and populating the Slav east.) With the view expressed in this confidential report few of those who study Germany would, I think, dissent few certainly of my colleagues in His Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Service, or any other Diplomatic Service.There is probably no immediate danger. As the Defence Requirements Committee put it: &quot; We have time, though not too much time, to make defensive preparations.&quot; Opinions must necessarily vary and depart into the realms of prophecy in estimating the length of that first period. The Germans are too competent, and matters are now moving too fast, to make a long estimate a safe one. The world has never seen a more formidable organisation; and this paper is showing it in its infancy. While it is getting over its growing pains, Hitler will be primarily occupied with domestic reorganisation. One thing admits no query: the proclaimed ends of present Nazi Germany can only be realised as the result of great sacrifices of, or on the part of, other Powers, including ourselves. Bearing this in mind, we must necessarily also remember that Sir H. Rumbold and Sir E. Phipps have both warned us against German protestations of pacifism. The former told us that Germany needs peace until she has recovered her strength. In January this year Sir E. Phipps wrote : &quot; Germany will continue to need peace until she has rearmed, and until prosperity returns.&quot; On this point I will conclude my quotations from the German by a typical passage from Deutsche Wehr (the German Army), ,&amp; weekly of nearly forty years standing, and formerly entitled The GermajnJ&amp;officers&apos; Gazette: &quot; The Great War taught us that all agreements and pacts between the different nations are merely valid in peace time, but not in the event of war, even in those cases where the enemy relies very strongly upon them.&quot;In view of this paper and others that have preceded and, I fear, may follow it, I would beg leave, in conclusion, to say a word on behalf of those who work with me in the Foreign Office who have seen this evidence and have faced the inferences.I have heard it suggested, particularly in the City, whose policy in respect of Germany has been a mill-stone round the neck of this country (see above), that the Foreign Office is anti-German and pro-French.It goes without saying that no capable or trustworthy public servant can be pro- or anti- any foreign country. It is his business to think of the interests and policy of his own country and of the Government that directs it. It is his responsibility to record and present facts, however unpalatable, nor is it his fault or desire that the facts should point in one direction.To many, including myself, it may indeed seem not unnatural that Germany should wish to recover part at least of what she had, and I have in the past made no secret of my view that a &quot;long-range &quot; policy must aim at the reconciliation of revisionist ideas with anti-revisionist fears and obstinacy.     ;But Nazi Germany has rudely disturbed the atmosphere in which alone such a consummation can in peace-time be achieved, and her citizens are daily being inoculated en masse with the fanatical doctrine that force is not only the sole but the intrinsically noble and desirable means of realising her ambitions. The League of Nations stands for a diametrically opposite political belief. ; That is why Germany left Geneva. Even if she returns under prayer and pressure, these ambitions and these consequences will not be changed unless she changes her heart and her teaching of the rising generation.  There lies the only acceptable test.ROBERT VANSITTART.April 7, 1934.
