(TiJIJOQSIMNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC L1LJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E G RET. 1   ,Copy No. J*f^CP.94(34).CABINET.Anti-terrorist ,Legislation in Assam. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.My colleagues will remember that on the 7th March they approved certain proposals which the Government of India had submitted to me for the extension to Assam of the special legislation against Terrorism which is in force in Bengal. The Bill was duly introduced in theAssam Council on the 12th March and was taken into consideration on the 19th, on which date motions for circulation of the Bill and for reference to a Select Committee were defeated by 33 votes to 14 and 28 votes to 19 respectively.    The Bill was then considered clause by clause and was finally passed without a division as a permanent measure on the 21st March. An amendment proposing a two years limit to the Bill had previously been rejected by 35 votes to 9-   The only amendment of major importance made in the Bill was in regard to the death penalty for attempted murder In deference to the views of the Council the Government of Assam agreed to delete this provision from the Bill.The passage of a Bill of this nature by the Assam Council as a permanent measure and without a division is I think a most satisfactory result upon which the Government of Assam are to be congratulated.S.. H.27th March 1934.
