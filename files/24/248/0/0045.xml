(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.SECRET CP. 109/54.CABINET.INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation &quot;by the Government of India,  dated 13th April,  1934.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated 13th April, 1934,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.During the last few weeks there has been a marked change in the political situation.    The important developments started with a conference of Congress leaders at Delhi which assembled just before Saster to consider once more the question of Council entry.       At its conclusion on 1st April,  it was announced that the conference had resolved to revive the &quot;All-India Swaraj party&quot; in order to enable Congressmen who are not offering individual civil disobedience to undertake,  through an organisation,  a constructive programme as contemplated in the Poona statement.It is imperative for the party to take up the Government&apos;s challenge in relation to the forthcoming election to the Legislative Assembly to secure election for its candidates on the following issues:(a) to implement the country&apos;s mandate to get all repressive laws repealed,(b) to reject proposals contained in the White Paper,  and to get them replaced by national demands indicated by Gandhi at the Round Table Conference&quot;. This resolution was published before being referredto Gandhi for his consideration and advice.     When-it was communicated to Gandhi he accorded his approval in the following words &quot;It is not only right,  but it is the duty of every Congressman, who for some reason or other does not want to or cannot take part in civil resistance,  to seek entry and form combination in order to prosecute programme which he believes to be in interests of his country&quot;.Mr.Gandhi&apos;s previous view on the question of Council entry may bo made clear by a quotation from a statement issued by him in July last oftor the Poona discussions, when
ho said:  &quot;my head reels at the very thought of entering Councils for the sake of winning independence.      They may give some relief of specific cases,  hub that is miasma to keep the nation from its goal&quot;.These resolutions and Mr.Gandhi&apos;s statement of approbation wont to show that the Swaraj party would be,  to some extent,  a separate organisation from Congress,  and that those Congress supporters who disapproved this policy, would be free to carry on individual civil disobedience.        The revival of the party might tend to accentuate the split in the Congress ranks for,  even though some of the leaders might hope- to increase their influence by securing election to the Councils, yet many of rank ana file, who have thrived by carrying on a subversive agitation during the last ten years and who have bean imbued with socialist or communist ideas,  would be reluctant to confine themselves to constitutional agitation.Though the attacks on the Government would be from two sides,  constitutional and unconstitutional, yet the Swaraj Party, without full backing of Congress behind it, might find it difficult to be returned in sufficiently large numbers to enable them to carry out their programme.Mr.Gandhi&apos;s next move was wholly unexpected by the country.        On April 7th, ho issued statement advising Congressmen to suspend civil disobedience for Swaraj as distinguished from specific grievances.        &quot;They should leave it to mo alone.      It should be resumed by others in my lifetime only under my direction unless one arises who claims to know the science better than I do.&quot;       He has taken some pains to explain that this statement was drafted before the Delhi Conference.Mr.Gandhi&apos;s statement is generally interpreted as being, in effect,  a calling off of civil disobedience and it is
3. -doubtful whether he v/ill ever make a more unequivocal statement.It is true that he remains theoretically free to revive the movement at any time either for Swaraj or to remedy specific grievances,  but for the present at least he appears to have recognised that this weapon has proved ineffective and must be dropped.      To what extent Congress will implement his advice,  either by formal resolution or in practice,  remains to be seen and on this will depend the policy which Government will have to adopt.     At present, congress leaders have not fully adjusted their minds to the new situation and there is general uncertainty as to what the next step should be. There are many divergent currents of thought in Congress, and there may be a feeling that a formal meeting, for instance of All-India Congress Committee, might bring these differences to light.The present developments, however, must not be interpreted as indicating a desire on the part of Congress to enter into friendly relations with the Government and co-operate in the new constitution.      For the moment their ultimate objective remains unchanged, but their methods are being changed from unconstitutional tc cons uitutioiial.During all this period Mr.Gandhi has been touring in the earthquake area of Bihar-    At a meeting of the Central Earthquake Relief Committee at Patna on 18th March, he moved and carried,  in spite of some opposition,  a resolution offering &quot;respectful co-operation&quot; to the Government in the work of relief.        In accordance with this resolution the Committee has got in touch with officers of the Local Government and after some days1 discussion,  issued a programme showing the work they were prepared to undertake; the two major items of work on which
4.expenditure will have to be incurred,  reconstruction of houses and removal of sand from fields,  they considered to be beyond their ability and have left the task entirely to the Government.They propose to devote their funds to minor items such as cleaning of wells and tanks,  relief to indigent, medical aid and sanitation,  and provision against floods and famine.        This programme is more a programme of &quot;village uplifting&quot; than earthquake relief and may provide occupation for a large number of Congress workers in the villages. The Local Government anticipated that,  if it is adhered to the greater part of the funds,  which amount to about Rs.20 lakhs, will be unexpended.      Meanwhile, Mr.Gandhi&apos;s speeches in his tour through this area have all been on the same formula,  that the earthquake was a visitation for sin of untouchability and the people should not demean themselves by begging.In Bengal the police record another signal success in the campaign against terrorism in the arrest of Ganguli,  a former Councillor of the Calcutta Corporation and a leader of the revolutionary party, who has succeeded in evading arrest since 1931.      His arrest is regarded as a severe blow to the movement in Central Bengal.    Other minor propaganda are also recorded and it is satisfactory that it is reported from Chittagong that the local authorities continue to make considerable progress in their propaganda against terrorism.      The Bill introduced in the Assam Council against terrorism has now been passed by a. substantial majority;  a serious mail robbery was committed by two armed revolutionaries in broad daylight in Sylhet while the Bill was under discussion,  and this incident probably converted some waverers.    The villagers,  it is satisfactory to note, captured one of the criminals and the other subsequently surrendered.
