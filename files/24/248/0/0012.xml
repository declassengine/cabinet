CONFIDENTIAL. (14318)[F 7824/128/23] No. 1.Memorandum respecting our Relations with Japan.AS a starting-point for an examination of our policy towards Japan, it will be well to consider what are her political and economic needs. On the political side, her prime needs are clearly a weak China and a Russia held in check. On the economic side, her needs are trade and the control of sources of raw material for her industry. Room for emigration must be ranked after these, for the practical capacity and desire for expansion overseas are not conspicuous with the Japanese; it is the stigma of racial differentiation, with its implication of inferiority, that they resent rather than the denial of facilities in practice. In any case, an increase of population at the present rate of 1 million a year cannot be.catered for by emigration.The urgent practical question before us is to determine how far our policy in China and our defensive measures against Japanese trade competition should be influenced or restricted out of fear of Japanese resentment. The prospects of trade retaliation can best be dealt with by the Board of Trade in the first place. On the political side, what are the chances of resentment taking a violent form ?There can be little doubt that Russia is the Power with which Japan is most likely to enter into armed conflict and against which she must protect herself. It is impossible to see what advantages Japan could hope to gain from a war with the United States that would compensate her for the loss or dislocation of her trade with them the most vital factor in her external economy. The United States take 80 per cent, of her raw silk expoi*ts still her most valuable export and the product on which the largest section of her population, the heavily indebted small-farmer class, depend to supplement their inadequate returns from agri-culture. In return, Japan depends largely on the United States for supplies of raw cotton. She would be mad to jeopardise this trade by taking the initiative in going to war. Her trade with India, less in importance only than her trade with the United States and China, is a similar deterrent from war with us, in which, indeed, apart from the possession of Hong Kong, there is little that she could not hope to achieve equally well by economic competition, for Singapore will, it is to be hoped, soon be secure from attack. Defensively, so long as the Washington Naval Treaty remains in force, Japan is virtually beyond reach of attack by the United States or by us. The treaty is subject to denunciation by two years&apos; notice from the 31st December, 1934, onwards.Proud and excitable as the Japanese may be, they have shown caution and self-control in the major crises of their history. They have invariably chosen safe moments for their aggressive actions; the most risky was the war against Russia in 1904, when they felt that the wolf was at their door, and then they had the British alliance to keep the ring for them. Recently, according to reliable reports, V they have decided on a policy of friendliness to us and to other countries, and their / protestations in this sense are believed to be sincere. They have lived down the resentment against us conceived at Geneva, and there is, it seems, no bone of contention between us except the issue of trade competition. So long, therefore, as they are not goaded beyond endurance by insults or unreasoning attacks on their vital interests, it is difficult to believe that the military spirit which they possess will lead them into adventures against the United States or the British Empire; it is likely rather to find better objectives and sufficient scope in facing Russia and in pursuit of the national aims in China. The development of Manchukuo, the safety of communication with that country and with Korea and the security of the Japanese mainland from air attack make the possession of Vladivostok and, less urgently, of the Maritime Province more obviously desirable than any other military objective. The oil resources of Northern Sakhalin and the fisheries of those waters would then fall into her lap and any further designs she may have of penetration in Mongolia or Northern China7159   [994 o-1]9722
would be greatly facilitated. There is more to be gained and less to be lost in a war with Russia than with the United States or the British Empire. The failure of the Siberian expedition, when Japanese troops were reported to have become infected with communism, suggests that there may be some hesitation in waging a war of aggression against Russia, but if, on consideration, Japan feels it more discreet to hold her hand, the Russian strategic position north and east of Manchukuo will greatly hamper her in undertaking warlike adventures against other Great Powers. It is difficult to conceive of an understanding between the two countries which would alter this position. The Soviet Government, in a crisis for Japan elsewhere, would surely exact a price which it would not be worth while to pay when the gains to be expected in other directions are so limited.In China, Japan will be in a certain dilemma, as Sir John Pratt shows. Too drastic a resort to military force will tend to worsen rather than promote her trade, though it may facilitate the acquisition of control over supplies of coal and iron in Shantung, Chahar and Shansi. The last two she may obtain by peaceful penetration from Jehol; it has been reported that she has already put forward to the Chinese a proposal for a railway running south-west from Jehol, which may be designed to tap these regions, and her pressure may be made effective through her power to mass troops in Jehol whence she can dominate Northern China. We may well see her use force for the attainment of objects such as these in periods of exasperation or impatience, alternating with periods of conciliation, in China. The construction of large permanent barracks in Shanghai shows that she intends to keep a considerable force there, whether as a means of instant pressure in the event of an intensive boycott or for other purposes not yet apparent.  We can do little, however, to prevent such measures.Our own needs in China may be summed up in the word &quot; prosperity.&quot; A strong China is not a necessity to us; indeed, the preservation of Hong Kong and, as long as possible, of our remaining special rights in China suffices to suggest the contrary. A strong China in the military sense is not, however, likely to come into existence for a long time, even if such a development were not obstructed from outside; and, since some degree of internal peace and effective administration is conducive to prosperity and greater purchasing power, which Japan must desire, there seems room for an adjustment of Japanese political aims in China with those of other countries. It has, in fact, been reported that the Japanese are anxious to see the destruction of communism in China out of regard for the greater prosperity which its disappearance would bring about. Japan at present is suspicious of the League advisers in China, partly, no doubt, out of resentment against the League, partly on account of Dr. Rajchman&apos;s ill-judged political activities, partly, perhaps, out of a vague and exaggei-ated fear of the advisers being too successful in creating a strong China, and partly from a desire to monopolise China for herself. The first two fears are of a ^temporary character and the third may well fade with time, but the Japanese will no doubt remain suspicious of any extension of foreign influence in China which will tend to weaken or limit their own. This suggests caution on our part in supporting League assistance to China, though such assistance is in our interests as promoting prosperity, and cannot be opposed if China desires it without causing resentment. The same caution will be necessary in any extensive schemes for financial assistance to China if and when such schemes become a practical issue.There are limits, which the Japanese, except in moments of unusual excite-ment, have always shown a capacity to recognise, to the antagonism which they can afford to arouse in other countries. The political situation and prospects (Outlined above suggest that we need not be unduly influenced by political dangers in considering how much energy to put into the task of protecting our interests both generally and in China against Japan. We have been in the habit of thinking that Japan could undermine our position in China if she set herself to do so. Further consideration has tended to modify this belief, which was, perhaps, unduly strengthened by the sense of political danger produced, and rightly produced, by the intense national excitement over the Manchurian affair and the handling of it by the League. Sir J. Brenan, I believe, is not unduly alarmed at the prospects of Japanese machinations against the International Settlement at Shanghai, and I am disposed to accept Sir J. Pratt&apos;s argument that it is the Chinese that we should be at pains to conciliate rather than the
Japanese so far as our interests in China are concerned. Our position there is exposed to danger from the Chinese rather than the Japanese. The Chinese can act as principals, or as tools of the Japanese. Taking the first alternative, the policy of conciliation, the policy, in fact, of the December memorandum, is generally accepted as that which serves us best, and I see no practical alternative to it. A different policy of rigid obstruction to the ambitions of Chinese national sentiment would be pursued with inadequate means and inadequate determina-tion; any momentary gains that might be won by an attempt to carry out such a policy would almost certainly be less than those to be obtained from increased trade with a friendly Chinese people. The policy of the December memorandum will also, I suggest, serve to mitigate, if not to remove, the danger of a combined Sino-Japanese attack on our interests in China. There is, no doubt, a certain risk of this. According to Dr. T. V. Soong, the Japanese have actually proposed to the Chinese to restore to them the sovereignty over Manchukuo in return for .an economic and military alliance, under which no other foreign interests would be allowed to find a place in China. The military alliance was to entail the right of Japan to station and move troops where she pleased in China, as already in Manchukuo. Dr. Soong&apos;s comment was that the idea was unthinkable, and, though he is particularly biassed against the Japanese, and although some Chinese may be attracted by the bait, the dislike of the Japanese is so ingrained that the prospects of such an alliance must remain highly doubtful. But what means are available to us to combat the danger ? So far as I can see, there is only the policy of friendliness to China, already advocated for its own sake, and the alternative policy of allying ourselves with Japan in trampling on China. The moral objections and the difficulties it would entail for us with the United States seem alike to dispose of the latter alternative. It would, moreover, I believe, be bad business. It would encourage the Japanese to prosecute ambitious plans. If these plans succeeded, the Japanese would soon discard their ally and leave our trade to fend for itself under Japanese and Chinese obstruction and hostility; if they failed, we should share the odium and suffer from Chinese resentment; a half-way i&apos;result would hardly leave us better off than we should be as a result of the other policy. There is, therefore, no case, as I see it, for a change in our policy. It only remains to determine whether we should refrain from actively opposing any Japanese plans in China which tend to damage our trade. I see no sufficient reason for such self-denial. We shall, in general, probably have the Chinese with us. While we cannot do much to prevent Japanese military action, we should not, if the views already expressed are accepted, be influenced by fears of the harm that Japan could do to our interests in China to the extent of tamely yielding to her pretensions. If we show fear of Japan, the Chinese will be encouraged to attack us when they are not currying favour in order to enlist our support against her. It may indeed be said that, in proportion as we strengthen our position against Japan, our interests in China will stand to gain, and, from this point of view, the completion of the Singapore Base and the maintenance of an adequate naval force in the Far East will be to the good.It remains to consider how far political fears should deter us from measures to defend our trade interests in other parts of the world against Japanese competition. The effects of Japanese hostility are particularly to be feared in China, and the arguments set out above in favour of resistance to Japanese economic pretensions there apply also elsewhere. If fear of Japanese resentment is not to be allowed to influence us there, it need not do so in the rest of the world. The conclusion is that we need not put pressure on the Board of Trade or the Colonial Office to refrain from protective measures against Japanese competition. This naturally does not mean that such measures should not be inspired by a reasonable moderation which will not go beyond necessities. There should be no spirit of hostility or undue jealousy, and I trust that it will not be necessary to denounce the commercial treaty. The Japanese appear to set as much store by most-fayoured-nation treatment in appearance as in reality, and if we cannot allow them to have a most-favoured-nation clause, which is presumably the point of difficulty in the existing treaty, their resentment on sentimental grounds is likely to be great. We should recognise the real needs of Japanese economy, avoid any appearance of deliberate antagonism, and confine our action within essential defensive limits. Each step should be capable of reasoned explanation. Apart from its effect in diminishing political dangers, a moderate attitude may bring
a measure of reward in actually reducing the severity of Japanese competition which has been enormously enhanced by the fall of the gold value of the yen to 40 per cent, of parity. If Japanese exports are given a sufficient outlet, the exchange value of the yen will rise and the selling cost of Japanese products with it. The Japanese seem likely to recognise the rationality of such an attitude. After the excitement of the past two years, they are showing evident signs of realising the weakness of their position and their need for good relations with us, and, indeed, with the rest of the world. The tendencies of the Japanese govern-mental and industrial structures favour the effective settlement of economic questions, if the desire for a settlement exists in governing circles. The virtual control of Government by the military elements will have a reflex effect in a greater sense of responsibility among those elements. Respect for authority has survived in great measure the abolition of the feudal system, and the pressure of the Government on industry is in the direction of concentrated organisation in that sphere. As compared with the greater anarchy of democratic and individualist countries, this points to greater ease in reaching agreement if we are prepared to offer terms which are acceptable to Government circles, though it points also to greater danger if we do not show a reasonable spirit. Inspired by such a spirit, we nevertheless cannot ignore the aggressive instincts of the Japanese, and the plans they cherish for an expansion in Asia which must react to our disadvantage if they realise that we are afraid of them. I therefore suggest that, besides meeting firmly the difficulties with which their industrial efficiency confronts us, we should, so far as we are able, but in no spirit of panic or immoderate haste, not&apos; hesitate to proceed with the Singapore Base and the strengthening generally of our naval position in the Far East. For financial reasons such a development can hardly be so rapid or so far-reaching as to induce an explosive reaction in Japan. Such a reaction we must be careful not to court by economic, military or political action, but within the limits of moderation there seems more to be lost than gained by a policy of tameness and timidity.It is difficult to estimate the chances of continued expansion of Japan&apos;s naval strength. Her comparative financial weakness inspires doubt as to her ability to carry such expansion very far, just as her exposed economic position makes it doubtful whether she would be prepared lightly to incur the risks of a war against the United States. For the third year in succession her budget will show a very heavy deficit and a limit may soon have to be set to naval expansion, though the aim of her naval authorities is manifestly the attainment of greater relative strength than she now enjoys. The question is one to which the commercial counsellor intends to devote himself in priority to others on return to Tokyo. At present the prospects are uncertain, but not unduly alarming.There is nothing drastic in the policy suggested above, and it is not one which cannot be modified if further developments should make it necessary. Changes in China, Russia and Germany which we cannot calculate may alter the position. Meantime, while observing all due friendliness to Japan, there seems no need to make ourselves subservient to her in directions inconvenient to ourselves. There is no need to go out of our way to obstruct her plans in Manchukuo, and it will be a mistake to oppose her trade expansion, except where , it comes into serious conflict with our own trade. She must be enabled to live j or we shall run the risk of an explosion. Further than this, it hardly seems that we can go. It has been suggested that we should cultivate friendliness even to the point of renewing the alliance which lapsed in 1921. The objections are overwhelming; the implications of such a step in China have been indicated above; even more decisive is the virtual breach which it would entail with the United States, against whom now-a-days rather than against Russia an alliance would seem to be directed, and the profound reaction which would follow in Canada,C.

(14320)[F 7818/5189/61]No. 2.Memorandum on British Policy in the Far East.I. Position in the Far East at the End of the Nineteenth Century.CHINA has always been the pivot of international relations in the Far East. Her vast territory, occupied by one-quarter of the human race endowed with almost every gift except a sense of political realities and a capacity for centralised government, is still an undeveloped market of almost fabulous potentialities. China has always accordingly been the occasion of political activities by Japan and by the Great Powers of Europe and America out of all proportion to the volume of trade actually passing over her borders. At the beginning of the 20th century two related developments were the cause of considerable anxiety : the increasing weakness of China, which laid her open to aggression and spoliation; and the ambitions and growing rivalry of Russia and Japan. The general object of British policy was to prevent this great potential market being closed against us either by obstructive action on the part of China herself or by the predatory activities of other Powers. We had been the first to force China to open the treaty ports to the trade of all the world, and. without seeking any exclusive advantage for ourselves, our constant endeavour had been to induce China to open the door still wider and extend the field for foreign trade and enterprise. By our pioneer work in railway construction and by securing the opening of the inland waterways to steam navigation we had accomplished something towards the opening up of the interior of China, but, in the absence of a Government capable of efficient administration or of under-standing the problems involved in modern commercial and international relations, progress had been disappointingly slow. At the end of the 19th century we occupied the foremost position in the Far East, but, in proportion as the march of events gradually drew China nearer to the main currents of world affairs, this position was more and more threatened by the approaching conflict between Russia and Japan and by the aggressive activities of European Powers. China now began to be cut up into spheres of influence, from which British enterprise was excluded, and railway and other concessions were extorted from her as instruments of imperialistic penetration. We did not wish to see China fall under the political or economic domination of any Power or group of Powers; nor did we wish to see Japan destroyed by Russia, for, apart from other considerations, that would have exposed all Manchuria, and probably a great part of North China as well, to be overrun by Russia. We therefore entered into an alliance with Japan, which enabled her to roll back the Russian menace both from her own shores and from China. At the same time, we did what we could to encourage the reform movement that appeared to have made a promising beginning in China after the Boxer rebellion of 1900.The Boxer rebellion was the last convulsive effort of Old China to get rid of its difficulties and its problems by driving the foreign virus out of China altogether. This having failed, room was made for the new forces that were from now on to shape the destiny of China, and that consciously aimed at learning the secrets of the West and at fitting China to take her place alongside of the other great States composing the civilised world. The reform movement affected every phase of the national life and directed it into the channels in which it is still flowing. We were anxious that this movement should be encouraged and afforded  every  opportunity  of  succeeding.   . We  adopted,   accordingly,   aII. Developments up to 1914.7161   [9457]B9722MWWIfflflnBHMIHfffflMMti^......r--r
sympathetic attitude towards the reasonable and legitimate aspirations of the Chinese people, and we gave concrete expression to that attitude in the Mackay Treaty of 1902, in which China was encouraged to reform her Administration with a view to the ultimate abolition of extra-territoriality. Apart from inconsistencies and errors of judgment, we suffered from two inevitable handicaps in the carrying out of a friendly and sympathetic policy towards China. The first.was that, while encouraging China to adopt a course which would ultimately render any special foreign privileges unnecessary, we were obliged at the same time to insist on the maintenance intact of the full treaty rights of British subjects; and the task of upholding the treaty system of which we had been the chief architects was one which the other Powers were very ready to leave to us alone. The second handicap was our alliance with Japan. From the moment that Japan succeeded to the position that China had allowed Russia to acquire in South Manchuria, China, then as now too weak in a military sense to defend her own territory, in order to keep Japanese imperialism at bay, adopted her traditional device of calling in a third party and intriguing with a view to playing off one foreign Power against another. We declined to be made a cat&apos;s-paw to pull the Manchurian chestnut out of the fire, but America eagerly took up the role for which China had cast her. She had long cherished a sentimental affection for the Chinese, and she greatly resented the exclusive rights, claimed by Russia and Japan in North and South Manchuria, which threatened to deprive United States citizens of those opportunities for trade and industry which they had a treaty right to enjoy. But, in championing the cause of China, America showed almost as great a lack of sense of political realities as China herself. In particular, the famous Knox proposal of 1908 for the, neutralisation and internationalisation of all railways in China merely had the effect of throwing Russia and Japan so recently at war into each other&apos;s arms. During the decade that elapsed between the Russo-Japanese War and the outbreak of the Great War was born that hostility between America and Japan which is still one of the chief features of the international situation in the Far East. Our position during this period as the ally of Japan was one of some embarrassment vis-a-vis both China and America, but after 1914 the position became very much worse.III. Seven Years of Japanese Aggression.Like Germany, Japan owed her position in the world to her prowess in war, and had every reason to believe in the gospel of force as an instrument of national aggrandisement. Yoshida Shoin, at the dawn of the Meiji era, had taught the Samurai that destiny called Japan to a career of conquest and expansion on the mainland of Asia. In 1894 she had fought and defeated China and. obtained a foothold in Korea; ten years later she fought and defeated a great European Power, pushed her outposts of Empire well on into South Manchuria, and obtained recognition from the rest of the world as a Great Power. Still another ten years had elapsed, and now the Great War brought opportunities of further gains. The war against Russia had made the army the idol of the nation. The military party were in the ascendant. For the next seven years they dictated the policy of their country, and there was almost no limit to their ambitions or to what they thought it was within their power immediately to grasp. The events of these seven years may be briefly recapitulated. Immediately after the war broke out in 1914, the Japanese laid siege to and captured Tsingtao. They then seized the Shantung Railway and placed garrisons along it at strategic points, including tsinan-fu, the capital cf the province. They appeared to believe that they could establish a footing in Shantung similar to that which they already enjoyed in Manchuria, and that this would enable them to dominate the whole intervening area, including Peking, the seat of the Central Government. In pursuit of this aim they presented the Twenty-one Demands in 1915, and forced China to yield the greater part of them in treaties signed under the threat of an ultimatum. In 1916 they vetoed the monarchical pretensions of Yuan Shih-kai, and, when their wishes were disregarded, helped to engineer a revolution which drove Yuan Shih-kai from power and to his death. Next, they sought, by means of the Nishihara loans, to keep in power in Peking a puppet Government subservient to their
wishes. In all this they had gravely miscalculated. Unlike Manchuria,. Shantung was densely populated, and the railway was by no means the economic spine of the province. Both in Shantung and in Peking, the stolid opposition of the solid mass of the Chinese people was an obstacle far more formidable than had been imagined. But what brought the whole policy of this period crashing to the ground was the failure of the Siberian expedition. The Japanese military party had hoped to extend their control over North Manchuria, to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, and even to set up an outpost of Empire on the shores of Lake Baikal. The whole adventure was a costly failure. The Japanese army returned discredited and disaffected, and the military party found to their dismay that they had lost the support of public opinion at home. In this chastened mood Japan was ready to enter the Washington Conference, liquidate some, at any rate, of her losses, and make a fresh start. Japan&apos;s aggressive policy during these years, besides incurring the resentment of China, had been watched with growing hostility and suspicion by both America and Canada. There was great community of sentiment on this subject between these two Powers, neither of which could contemplate the prospect of a sort of Monroe doctrine which would shut them out from the countries on the opposite shores of the Pacific. Much of this resentment and suspicion fell upon us as the ally of Japan, for, most unjustly, it was forgotten that the exigencies of the Great War had compelled us to stand aside while Japan pursued her policy of aggression, and, most unreasonably, it was believed that the alliance was directed against America. It was clear that the alliance, which had served a great purpose in its time, had now become a liability instead of an asset. It was damaging our relations with America and China, and it might even operate to draw Canada closer to America and away from the Empire. As soon as the dust of Versailles had cleared away and the world had time to take stock of the situation in the Far East, an attempt was made at the Washington Conference to make that fresh start for which the time was obviously ripe.IY.-The Fresh Start at Washington, 1921-22.There had always been a fundamental similarity of aim between British and American policy in the Far East. Both countries stood for the open door and equality of opportunity; neither sought for exclusive privileges for themselves and both were opposed to the carving out of spheres of influence by others; both desired to assist China in her struggle to modernise her institutions and evolve a new political order; both were ready to sympathise with China&apos;s legitimate nationalist aspirations and both felt the difficulty of giving practical expression to that sympathy until China&apos;s political chaos had been reduced to some degree of order. The aim of the Washington Conference was to secure the adoption of these Anglo-American principles as the basis of the Far Eastern policy of all the Powers. In order to achieve this aim it was essential to offer Japan inducements which would make it worth her while genuinely to accept a policy of international co-operation in China. Japan&apos;s chastened mood and the real statesmanship displayed on this occasion by the United States, who were willing to sacrifice to the common good their commanding lead in battleship construction, made success possible. At the Washington Conference the Anglo-Japanese alliance was cancelled and was replaced by a quadruple compact between the United States, the British Empire, France and Japan. By this agreement the parties mutually agreed, inter alia, to respect their rights in relation to their insular possessions in the Pacific Ocean (excluding the four main islands of Japan). By the Five-Power Treaty of the 6th February, 1922, the United States, the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan agreed, inter alia, to a proportionate limitation of capital ships, and the United States, the British Empire and Japan agreed to maintain the status quo in regard to fortifications and naval bases in certain areas in the Pacific Ocean. Japan was thus placed in a far stronger position than that which she occupied under the alliance. Both Hong Kong and the Philippines were left at the mercy of the Japanese navy. Japan, however, was secured against the establishment of a naval base by either of the other two principal naval Powers within striking distance of her main islands, and her defensive position in the Western Pacific was thus made absolutely impregnable by sea. In return for being thus safeguarded against aggression, she was asked to agree with the other[9457] &apos; b 2
Powers on a policy of non-aggression towards China.  By the Nine-Power Treaty of the 6th February, 1922, the Powers agreed (1) To respect the sovereignty, the independence and the territorial andadministrative integrity of China. ;(2) To provide the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to China todevelop and maintain for herself an effective and stable Government. -   (3) To use their influence for the purpose of effectually establishing and maintaining the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations throughout the territory of China. (4) To refrain from taking advantage of conditions in China in order to seek special rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjects or citizens of friendly States and from countenancing actioninimical to the security of such States.Of the other stipulations of the treaty the most important was a formal undertaking that there would be no attempt by the Powers to create spheres of influence. By further instruments signed technically outside the conference, Japan agreed to withdraw from the untenable position she had taken up in Shantung. When signing the Nine-Power Treaty, Japan doubtless made a mental reservation in respect of her special position in Manchuria. On the whole, however, she made a genuine effort to pursue a conciliatory and good-neighbourly , policy in accordance with the spirit of the new dispensation; but, unfortunately, she gained no credit for this in America, where hostility to Japan continued unabated, and reaped no advantages in China. The Chinese failed either to take advantage of the opportunity offered them by the Washington Conference to set their house in order or to respond to the new conciliatory spirit in Japanese policy. Political chaos prevented progress until the Nationalist movement under Russian inspiration and guidance suddenly became an effective and dynamic force.V. Rtissia and the Nationalist Movement in China.It was at the close of the 16th century that Russia, having thrown off the Mongol yoke, advanced to the Urals. In the short space of fifty-seven years  1582 to 1639 she had reached the Sea of Okhotsk, and had made the whole of Siberia Russian territory. The advance was rapid, because Siberia was practically unoccupied territory, but emigration from Russia was a mere trickle. By the middle of the nineteenth century the population of Siberia was under 3 millions, most of whom were west of Lake Baikal. East of Lake Baikal the Russian advance had been wholly to the north of the Amur River. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there had been occasional clashes with the Manchus, but the Russians had wisely preferred to avoid contact with the settled civilisation to the south. By the middle of the nineteenth century other influences were at work, which caused a change in the direction of Russian adventure.The search for a warm water port, the desire to improve communications with the growing Russian possessions on the Pacific, and a growing taste for imperialism, turned Russian eyes towards the Amur. In 1858, three years after the Crimean war, the Treaty of Aigun gave Russia the left bank of the Amur, and in the same year was first mooted the project of a Trans-Siberian railway. In 1860 Russia secured from China the whole of the Primorsk, including Vladivostok. In 1891 the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway was begun at both ends, Vladivostok being now the Far Eastern terminus instead of the mouth of the Amur. By 1896 the line had reached a point between Lake Baikal and the upper reaches of the Amur, and at this psychological moment China turned to Russia for help against Japan. The war against China in 1894-95 was Japan&apos;s first step on the path of continental expansion marked out for her by Yoshida Shoin and his school. The next step would take her into Manchuria, and therefore, in order to enable Russia to transport troops to the spot where effective aid would be required, permission was granted to Russia to build what was in effect a Russian State railway and a link in the Trans-Siberian system straight through Manchuria. Two years later a branch was built southward through Manchuria to Port Arthur, and Russia thus threatened not only Japan&apos;s position in Korea but her very existence as a nation. Nemesis then began to overtake her. She was defeated by Japan and the Treaty of Portsmouth pushed her back to
North Manchuria. A decade later the Great War and the Bolshevik revolution gave China the opportunity to recover control in North Manchuria. Chinese troops and police were now stationed along the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the whole discreditable adventure seemed to have crumbled into ruin. When Soviet Russia was once more in a position to turn her attention to the Far East, it suited her to appear in the guise of the champion of Chinese nationalism against the imperialism of the West, and to pretend that she had voluntarily divested herself of the unjust privileges extorted by the unequal treaties of the Tsarist regime. In 1923 Karakhan arrived in Peking, and Borodin went to Canton as adviser to Sun Yat-sen. The plan which they now set about carrying out was to give all possible assistance in men, money and munitions to the Nationalists. Communism was to be kept strictly in the background, but the Nationalist revolutionary move-ment was to be guided into extreme courses and assisted in its onslaught both on foreign capitalists and domestic reactionaries. Then in the moment of triumph  and not till then the Communists were to seize command of the revolutionary forces and establish a Soviet regime in China. If this final coup proved successful, the next step would be to extend the world revolution to India and Japan. But, even if it failed, there seemed to be a fair chance of bringing about chaos and anarchy in China.VI. Triumph of Nationalism and Establishment of Nanking Government.As shown above, it had been realised at a very early stage of the Nationalist movement that British interests would best be served by adopting a sympathetic attitude towards the reasonable and legitimate aspirations of the Chinese people; but so long as China failed to provide herself with a reasonably efficient administration and an effective Government it was difficult to give practical -effect to our sympathy, and difficult to appear in any other than our traditional role of champion and upholder of the treaty system.   This attitude now involved us in serious danger. A chance affray in the international Settlement at Shanghai, when police officers of British nationality fired upon a Chinese mob containing students, played directly into the hands of the Russians and turned the full force of the Nationalist attack upon Great Britain and British interests in China. In these circumstances a change in British policy a change in emphasis rather than in fundamental principles became urgently necessary.   In December 1926 His Majesty&apos;s Government communicated to the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty a memorandum (known as the December memorandum) in which they suggested, in substance, that some immediate measure of satisfaction should be given to China in respect of her claim to treaty revision without insisting on the prior establishment of a strong Central Government a condition which as experience had shown in effect meant an indefinite postponement of action.   The practical measures which were taken to carry this policy into effect restored the British position in China.   The ruin of the Soviet plans was completed by the strong revulsion that took place against the horrible results of Soviet policy in South China and by the discovery of the true nature of the instructions under which the Soviet agents were working.  In 1927 the Russian advisers were expelled from China, and the Kuomintang, purged of its extremist elements, rapidly swept the country, and in 1928 established the present National Government of China at Nanking.   The psychological effect of this triumph of the Nationalist party was very great.   According to a sober estimate of the situation formed at the time, it seemed wise to proceed on the assumption that henceforth we might have a peaceful and orderly China to deal with and that the whole country-  or at any rate a substantial portion of the whole country would be administered, not indeed by one central authority, but in accordance with the same principles and on a comparatively uniform pattern.   The Chinese, of course, took a much more enthusiastic view of the situation.   They believed that, on the basis of the ideology of Sun Yat-sen, they had found the solution of their constitutional and political difficulties, and that the modern walls of Jericho the unequal treaties and special foreign privileges would collapse at the sound of the Kuomintang&apos; trumpet.   The consequences in Manchuria of the action taken in accordance with that belief have produced the situation with which we are faced in the -Far East to-day.
VII. Failure of Nationalist Attack on Russian Position in Manchuria.The Bolshevik conspiracy described in paragraph VI was only to be carried out in China proper. In Manchuria different considerations determined Soviet policy. They wished to avoid provoking a conflict with Japan and in spite of their renunciation of Tsarist privileges they aimed at restoring the former Russian position a capitalist position in North Manchuria. Consequently, while Soviet agents engaged freely in Communist propaganda, there was an attempt to stir up the subversive movements among workmen and peasants that had wrought such havoc in South China. In 1924, agreements were signed which restored Soviet control over the Chinese Eastern Railway and its subsidiary enterprises. This was followed by a considerable extension of Soviet commercial enterprise. It was also followed by acute friction between the Soviets and the local Manchurian authorities and unremitting attempts on the part of the latter to undermine the position of the former. The ruler of Manchuria, Chang Hsueh-liang, the young marshal, disregarding the warnings of Japan, hoisted the Kuomintang flag at Mukden at the end of 1928 a few months after the establish-ment of the National Government at Nanking and Manchuria was thus for the first time opened to Kuomintang propaganda. Poetic justice marked out the Russians as its first victim. The collapse of the Soviet conspiracy in China in 1927 had already filled the Chinese with contempt for the Russians and strengthened their belief that Moscow was powerless to protect her own people. They believed that they could with impunity attack the Russians and accordingly early in 1929 they proceeded to liquidate by force the Russian position on the Chinese Eastern Railway as well as the remaining Russian rights and interests in North Manchuria. To their dismay the Soviet forces, in approved imperialistic style, promptly invaded North Manchuria, and Chinese resistance as promptly collapsed. Undeterred by this warning the Chinese continued to attack, though in less spectacular fashion, the Japanese position in South Manchuria.VIII. Nationalist Attack on Japanese Position in Manchuria.Japan&apos;s special position in South Manchuria as it existed up to September 1931 dated from the Treaty of Portsmouth of 1905, by virtue of which she succeeded to Russian rights and privileges in South Manchuria. As the Lytton Commission pointed out, it was an important and unusual position to which nowhere in the world has there ever been an exact parallel. &quot; She governed the leased territory of Kwantung with practically full rights of sovereignty. Through the South Manchurian Railway she administered the railway areas, including several towns and large sections of such populous cities as Mukden and Changchun; and in these areas she controlled the police, taxation, education and public utilities. She maintained armed forces in many parts of the country: the Kwantung army in the leased territory; railway guards in the railway areas and consular police throughout the various districts.&quot; It was chiefly the strategic importance of the region that made the special position of vital importance to Japan. &quot; To the Japanese the war with Russia will ever be remembered as a life and death struggle fought in self-defence against the menace of Russian encroachment. The fact that 100,000 Japanese died in this war and that 2 billion gold yen were expended have created in Japanese minds a determination that these sacrifices shall not have been made in vain. Patriotic sentiment, the paramount need for military defence and the exceptional treaty rights all combine to create the claim to a special position in Manchuria. The Japanese conception of this special position is not limited to what is legally denned in treaties and agreements either with China or with other States. Feelings and historical associations, which are the heritage of the Russo-Japanese war, and pride in the achievements of Japanese enterprise in Manchuria for the last quarter century, are an indefinable but real part of the Japanese claim to a &apos; special position.&apos; &quot; A special position of this character occupied by one country in territory belonging to and administered by another must make constant friction inevitable and an eventual explosion extremely probable. In this difficult situation the Chinese showed their usual lack of any sense of political realities. Mistaking the conciliatory policy that Japan followed after the Washington Conference for weakness, they responded with a policy of pin-pricks and petty
irritations. Eventually they appear to have believed that they could squeeze the Japanese out of Manchuria by economic pressure, and with this end in view encircled the South Manchurian Railway with a network of Chinese lines. &quot;During the two years (from 1929 to 1931) the Chinese attempted to operate these various lines as a great Chinese railway system and made efforts to routeall freight, if possible exclusively over the Chinese operated lines.....   As aresult the Chinese made through traffic arrangements for all parts of their railway system and refused in important sections to make similar traffic arrangements between their lines and the South Manchurian Railway system.....   Associatedwith these through traffic controversies a bitter rate war sprang up between the Chinese and the Japanese lines.&apos;&apos; This direct and to some extent successful attack upon what was the hub of the whole Japanese position in Manchuria played directly into the hands of the growing body of public opinion in Japan that disliked the Washington Conference and was discontented with the conciliatory policy.IX.- The Explosion in Manchuria and Japan&apos;s Resignation from the League.Some time during 1931 the military party in Japan appear to have reached the conclusion that the interests of their country would best be served by the failure of the efforts which the Japanese Government were then making  genuinely, though not very successfully to reach a general understanding with China over Manchurian issues. Skilfully selecting a moment when the rest of the world as in the case of the Twenty-one Demands in 1915 were fully preoccupied with their own difficulties, they opened hostilities on the 18th September, 1931. Chinese-constituted authority was driven out of Manchuria, and in place thereof there was set up the State of Manchukuo  nominally independent, but, in fact, a puppet State under Japanese control. China appealed to the League, but Japan consistently to the end maintained the attitude that this was an affair that could only be settled by direct negotiations between China and Japan, and that the League was doing a disservice to the cause of world peace by encouraging China to adopt an unpractical and intransigent attitude instead of advising her that she must stand on her own legs and shoulder her own responsibilities. After eighteen months&apos; litigation at Geneva, Japan has withdrawn from the League and has, in effect, renounced her obligations under both the Covenant of the League and the Nine-Power Treaty; Manchukuo appears to be firmly established and not to be seriously embarrassed by the fact that it cannot be recorded recognition, while China has at length been made to realise that she must settle the question of her future relations with Japan without looking for material support from other Powers. The whole structure of international relations in the Far East, based on the principle of international co-operation in China, built up at the Washington Conference, has been destroyed. Before the Powers had time to take stock of the new situation thus created, another and perhaps even more far-reaching development supervened, namely, Japan&apos;s sudden invasion of the markets of the world.X. The Economic Menace of Japan.If the ideas of Yoshida Shoin were originally suggested by the example of Europe, and if, originally, there was not inherent reason in national temperament or economic necessity that should cause the Japanese to break out from their island home, such reasons were quickly supplied by the development of events in the 19th century. The desire for a higher standard of living that followed on the opening of commercial intercourse with the West was accompanied by a rapid rise in population; Korea, too effete to stand alone, lay between China and Japan, and must fall under the domination of one or the other; and, finally, there was the ominous advance of Russia, who, towards the end of the 19th century, threatened to overrun both Manchuria and Korea and extinguish Japan as an independent State. All these influences decided the destiny of Japan. She seemed clearly to be faced with the alternative of expanding as a powerful naval and military State, or of remaining shut up within her islands to starve and eventually to perish. The population of Japan, which had long remained -stationary, began to grow rapidly from 33 millions in 1872 until it reached
66 millions in 1933. The present rate of increase has now reached the tremendous figure of over 1 million a year. The population of Japan per square mile of arable land is the highest in the world as the following table shows :-Japan          ... ... 2,774 Germany      ...         ... 806United Kingdom ... 2,170 France          ...          ... 467Belgium       ... ... 1,709 United States of America 229Italy           ... ... 819Even though she lacked most of the raw materials of modern industry, Japan was thus obliged to become an industrialist State; the livelihood of her people depends, in an even greater degree than in the case of the United Kingdom, on her ability to find and keep open markets capable of absorbing an increasing quantity of her manufactured goods and of serving as a source of supply of raw materials. Unlike the United Kingdom, she has sought to gain foreign markets for her manufactures, while excluding to the utmost foreign manufactures from her own market. Over a prolonged period she has steadily pursued a policy of encouraging domestic industries and diminishing the dependence of Japan upon imported products other than indispensable raw materials. By the exercise of an uncommon degree of skill, energy and determination, aided by low wages and good workmanship, Japanese industry has now attained a remarkably high standard of efficiency; guided and encouraged by the Government, it has worked with a rare unity of purpose and concerted effort towards a definite goal. The chief characteristic of Japan&apos;s import trade over a long period of years is the steady decline in the proportion of manufactured goods and the steady increase in the proportion of raw materials. Japanese exports are distributed as follows : To  Per cent.United States of America ... ...        42-^Asia (China, 16 per cent.) ... ...        42^Europe ... ... ... ... other countries .... ... ... 8Two-thirds of Japan&apos;s total exports consist of silk and cotton in various forms. Four:fifths of her exports to America consist of raw silk, a luxury rather than a necessity. &quot; Sales of raw silk alone account for 25 per cent, of her total receipts from exports, and the price she can obtain for raw silk governs to a large extent the prosperity and purchasing power of nearly one-half of her population.&quot; Japan is thus in many respects in a highly vulnerable position. If America ceased to buy her raw silk, or if boycotts or civil wars in China or tariffs in India check or shut out her export of cotton-goods, the injury to her whole economic structure would be very great. On the other hand, the percentages in the above table of only 7 per cent, for Europe and 8 per cent, for the rest of the world are significant. There were many markets to which Japanese goods had not yet penetrated, but on which at any moment an attack might be launched. That, in fact, is the situation which has now developed. Japan did not escape the effects of the great slump that set in in 1929, and her difficulties were greatly increased by the outbreak of hostilities in Manchuria in the autumn of 1931 and in Shanghai in the spring of 1932. Though, in general, far too gloomy a view was taken in most foreign countries of Japan&apos;s financial and economic position during the period of the Geneva litigation, nevertheless it was sufficiently unpleasant, for, in addition to the losses due to the general disorganisation of trade in one of her principal markets, she had to suffer the enormous ^additional losses inflicted by the Chinese boycott. About the middle of 1932, however, there was a dramatic change for the better. In December 1931 Japan had abandoned the gold standard, and the yen (parity = 0 - 498 gold dollars) gradually but steadily dropped to -205 in the course of the ensuing twelve months. The effect of this depreciation did not make itself felt till June 1932, but from then on there was a recovery in exports which the commercial counsellor at Tokyo describes as &quot;almost startling.&quot; He continues : &quot; The principal items of export have been raw silk and cotton textiles, but, in addition to these staples, Japanese manufactures in great variety have found their way into almost all the world&apos;s markets. Hardly a post is.received at this Embassy which does not contain accounts, official or private, of the deadly competition of Japanese goods in the
most widely- separated parts of the Empire. ... It is riot, as hitherto, only markets for cheap cottons, toys, &amp;c, which are affected. Japanese goods of increasingly wider range and higher quality are finding their way into industrialised centres like Great Britain and the United States. . . . Japanese wages are low, Japanese currency is well below half its par value; and these two great advantages are given a deadly effectiveness by the enterprise and industry of Japanese manufacturers and merchants. Nobody who has observed the growth of Japanese industry and trade during the past decade can fail to be impressed by their remarkable increase in efficiency. Japan is rapidly taking her place as one of the great industrial States, and it would be a mistake to ascribe her success solely to the transitory advantages of depreciated currency and cheap labour.&quot; Although there is thus probably much exaggeration in the view that it was the Chinese boycott that drove Japan to seek and invade other markets, nevertheless it is probably true that the problem of Japan&apos;s future policy is very largely a problem of her future relation with China.XI. Relations between China and Japan.The position that Japan has acquired in the Ear East has given rise to some anxiety as to the use that she may make of her power. The fears most commonly expressed are either that Japan will &quot; dominate &quot; China and exclude all other countries from that market or that she will succeed in entering into some sort of alliance with China (purchasing China&apos;s goodwill by surrendering extra-territoriality and so forth), and that China and Japan will then proceed to saboter all foreign interests. It is also commonly believed that Japan has it in her power almost at any moment to inflict serious injury on our interests in China, and that for this reason it behoves us to refrain as far as possible from any course likely to antagonise Japan. Before examining these various possibilities it is necessary to guard against a certain confusion of thought that has sometimes crept into the discussion. &quot;Dominating&quot; and &quot;cultivating goodwill&apos;&apos; are mutually exclusive terms. If Japan dominates China she will certainly lose her goodwill; if she attempts to cultivate her goodwill she must studiously refrain from attempting to dominate. There are various degrees of domination. The best example of domination is provided by the history of Manchuria during the present century. From 1905 onwards Japan dominated South Manchuria by means of her ownership of the South Manchurian Railway and the troops which she maintained in the railway zone. This was effective and profitable up to a point. Manchuria was kept free from civil wars and was therefore comparatively prosperous and the Japanese got the cream of all that was to be had in both trade and industry. But they did not by any means haAre everything their own way. They could not, for example, prevent the country being flooded with paper money, which ultimately ruined trade almost as effectively as the civil wars in China. Domination meant incessant friction with the locai Chinese authorities. There were certain treaty rights which the Japanese were never able to enjoy and schemes to which they attached the greatest importance which they &quot;were never able to carry through. The Twenty-One Demands enabled them to give another turn to the screw, but even so, as the country filled up and the Chinese built their own railways, Japanese domination became less and less effective until eventually the Chinese came within measurable distance of squeezing them out- economically altogether. The Japanese then eliminated Chinese authority entirely and established the most complete domination possible short of actual annexation. This seems likely to be effective. The probabilities are that Manchukuo will attain a fair degree of order, stability and prosperity, and that there will be no effective challenge to Japanese authority until a Nationalist movement arises from within. This, however, is not likely to happen for another ten or dozen years at least.If the question is asked whether Japan can dominate China as she has in the past dominated Manchuria, the answer would appear to be : Yes, but within very restricted limits. By keeping a few troops at certain strategic points Japan could probably without much difficulty maintain a pax Jdponica over a considerable part of North China. But any attempt to use this domination for the purpose of establishing a regime of special privilege comparable to that which existed in South Manchuria would involve them in such incessant friction and so many difficulties that they would be obliged either to abandon the attempt&apos; [9457] c
or proceed to annexation-open, as in the case of Korea, or veiled, as in the case of Manchuria. It is difficult for anyone who is acquainted with China and the peculiar characteristics of the Chinese their psychological unity, their solidity, their vast numbers and capacity for mass resistance to believe it possible for any Power least of all Japan to annex and hold any substantial portion of China. It is doubtful whether the Japanese entertain any such ambition. Their attitude seems to be that they are prepared to use. violence whenever, in their opinion, the Chinese have gone too far in damaging Japanese interests or prestige, and they intend by a display of force in North China to maintain peace along the line of the Great Wall, not because they have any predatory designs in North China, but solely in order that the development of Manchukuo shall not be disturbed by disorders fomented from China. On the other hand, it is undoubtedly true that, as a result of the failure of the Kuomintang and the loss of faith in Sun Yat-sen&apos;s political ideology, the Chinese as a whole are now suffering from the psychology of frustration and despair. Disintegration and the decay of political institutions, of which the recent developments in Fukien are a symptom, have reached depths never reached before, and some observers detect a tendency on the part of the Chinese in the north to break away and ally themselves with Manchukuo. All that can be said is that such a development seems improbable, but is not impossible. At the present stage it is too early to attempt to forecast in advance its implications and consequences.Another possibility is that Japan may acquire if not a dominating at any rate a predominant position in China by entering into an alliance with the Chinese Government. The object of this alliance would be to give effect to the pan-Asiatic idea and enable China and Japan under Japanese leadership to present a united front against Western imperialism. Expressed in more concrete terms it would mean that Japan would make a treaty with China surrendering axtra-territoriality, concessions and all other unequal privileges, and would then aid China to force all other foreign Powers also to surrender extra-territoriality, &amp;c.; by rendering it impossible for foreign nationals to live and trade even in the treaty ports this would destroy all foreign vested interests in China. The way would thus be left clear for Japanese trade, finance and industry to monopolise the whole Chinese market without fear of competition. Now any such development as this would mean that the Japanese surrender of extra-territoriality, &amp;c, would have been a sham, and the real effect of the treaty would have been to place Japanese subjects in a more highly privileged position even than that which they now enjoy. Japanese vessels would be plying on all inland waterways, Japanese subjects would be trading throughout the interior, and wherever they went the long arm of the Japanese Government would insist on their enjoying protection for life and property and immunity from vexatious taxation and interference. All this might be called by some other name than extra-territoriality, but in effect the Chinese Government, by signing such a treaty, would have handed over their country bound hand and foot to Japan, and would have by the same stroke deprived themselves of their favourite weapon, namely, the power to play off one foreign Power against another. There does not seem to be any valid reason for supposing that any Chinese Government would adopt so insane a course, or that, even if they entered into such a bargain, they would ever be in a position to deliver the goods. The bogey of a possible alliance between China and Japan has cropped up at intervals for many years past, but it seems hardly worthy of serious consideration. There are frequent rumours that Japan is about to sell the pass by surrendering extra-territoriality, but this again need give no cause for alarm. If Japan surrenders extra-territoriality she can only do so in return for stipulations which will provide adequate protection for Japanese nationals. It would not hurt us to follow her lead if we were obliged to do so, because what was adequate for Japanese would also be found to be adequate for British subjects., Fears are also expressed lest the Japanese do some local deal with the Chinese at Shanghai, for instance that may be harmful to British interests. It would seem, however, to be waste of time to endeavour to track out all the possibilities of oriental intrigue. The Japanese have in the past endeavoured to obtain a Government in China favourable to their interests by means of a policy of subsidies. She may very likely resort to this method again whenever a favourable opportunity- national or local may seem to present itself, but the results are not likely to be either very brilliant or far-reaching.
A hostile or resentful Japan would be in many ways a serious embarrassment to us in our China policy. The Chinese would be quick to take advantage of any such breach between two important foreign Powers, and we might find that the difficulties of protecting British subjects and their trade from vexatious interference had been increased. It seems doubtful, however, whether Japanese hostility could inflict vital injury on our interests in China unless Japan were provoked to the point of actually using violence against us. If Great Britain had joined in applying sanctions to Japan in the case of the dispute with China, Japan would almost certainly have seized Hong Kong, the International Settlement at Shanghai and all remaining British concessions; British subjects would have been driven out of China and their vested interests destroyed, and we should have been powerless to prevent it. There is, however, not the slightest danger that any British Government would allow such a situation to arise; nor would it appear to be difficult for any Britsh Government to pay such regard to Japan&apos;s legitimate interests as to avoid giving reasonable ground for hostility that would be reflected against us in her China policy. A factitious hostility worked up by politicians of the type of Mr. Matsuoka is perhaps more difficult to avoid, but in so far as it lacked any reasonable basis it would not be greatly to be feared. British interests in China have far more to fear from a hostile China (as in 1925-26) than from a hostile Japan. It would be showing undue timidity to push the fear of provoking Japan to the point of abstaining from insisting on a due regard for British interests.On the whole it seems unlikely that there would be any sudden or dramatic change in the relations between China and Japan. The Chinese will continue instinctively to obstruct the economic, industrial and political penetration of their country by Japan, but their actions will be governed by a wholesome fear of the force that Japan will certainly use if obstruction is carried too far, and by the know^-Jsdge that effective help against Japan is not to be obtained in either Europe or America. The Japanese, on the other hand, are well aware that the difference of scale&apos; renders impossible the repetition in China of the coup successfully executed in Manchuria, and that the attack on Shanghai was a. blunder the repetition of which in any form is to be avoided at all costs. Both sides being anxious to avoid major causes of dispute, relations between the two countries will probably on the surface be more harmonious than for some time past, but fundamentally it is unlikely that there will be any great change. In this respect, as in others, we shall be faced in China with an indeterminate situation lacking precision and in which clear-cut solutions are never reached.XII. Relations between Japan and Soviet Russia; Influence of America.In carrying through her Manchurian policy Japan took the measure of Soviet Russia and concluded that she could be treated as a negligible quantity. The whole of North Manchuria was included in the State of Manchukuo and Russian rights and interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway were entirely ignored. The first act of the Japanese military authorities after they had consolidated their position was to complete the construction of a railway from Rashin, on the Korean coast, to the south of Vladivostok, running parallel to the Chinese Eastern Railway through Harbin westwards towards Outer Mongolia. The Manchukuo authorities were then encouraged in various devious ways to make the operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway practically impossible. It was clear that if the Japanese so willed it the value of the Chinese Eastern Railway, both commercially and strategically, was nil. In fact, in the absence of adequate protection against sabotage and theft, it might in time physically cease to exist. In 1929 the Soviets had vigorously and successfully vindicated their rights against the Chinese. From 1931 onwards, though they massed considerable forces east of Lake Baikal, they have never been able to do more than play the role of an impotent onlooker. Eventually they announced their willingness to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to Manchukuo, and negotiations, to this end have been pursuing a languid course in Tokyo for some months past. The Chinese Eastern Railway cost the Russian Government of the old regime some 800 million roubles (a great part of which came out of the pockets of French bondholders); the Soviet Government asked for 250 million yen, and the Manchukuo negotiators are said to have offered 50 million yen. It seems unlikely that the negotiations can be brought to a successful issue, and once again there[9457] c 2
are rumours of strong Soviet forces being hurried to the east of Asia. If the Soviets were strong enough they would have declared war on Japan already, and it may well be the policy of the military party in Japan to provoke them into -doing so. As a glance at the map will show, the possession of the Primorsk up to the mouth of the Amur River either as a separate Japanese colony or as rounding off the State of Manchukuo would turn the Sea of Japan into an inland lake and take away the menace of air attack on Japan from Vladivostok. Its strategic value would be enormous. If, as seems highly probable, the Japanese contemplate extending their influence and their Empire from Manchukuo westwards into Inner, and then Outer, Mongolia, it may well be their intention sooner or later to seize the Primorsk. Russia will never forget or forgive the manner in which Japan has ridden roughshod over her in regard to the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Primorsk may provide another and even more bitter grievance. From this situation various consequences of the highest importance flow. The boundary dividing the Japanese Empire from Soviet Russia will be as long as that between Canada and America, but on the other side of that boundary will be a bitterly hostile State awaiting the first favourable opportunity to strike and take revenge.With a hostile Russia on her flank, and a programme of expansion on the mainland of Asia to carry through, it would seem that Japan, for all her superabundant energy and vitality, will be in no position to embark on adventures in other parts of the world. There is nebulous talk of a Japanese programme of expansion down through South China into Malaya and the South Seas. If anything more is meant than a determination to capture fresh markets for Japanese trade, then it is difficult to imagine how any such plans of political expansion could take concrete shape. None of the numerous very detailed reports that come from British Malaya have ever suggested that the Japanese are a political danger. In the Netherlands East Indies, on the othei^!c\and, the Japanese are greatly feared so much so that, when news was received that Japan had withdrawn from the League, a mild panic prevailed and troops were actually hastily sent to reinforce the oil ports. It is of course conceivable that the Japanese might make a descent upon the Netherlands East Indies in order to secure a source of oil supplies for their navy, or might seize the Philippines, or the Japanese navy might appear off Australia and demand the opening of the northern territories to Japanese immigration. But, in view of her very serious military preoccupations nearer home, the danger that Japan will embark on wild-cat military adventures further afield hardly seems to be one that needs to be seriously guarded against. The struggle in these regions will be on the economic plane a struggle for markets, such as that now in progress in India.In addition to the bitter enmity of Russia, the hostility of America must \act as a further check upon Japan. It is true that nothing short of an attack ppon the Philippines would actually bring America into the field. She has been frustrated by Japan in everything that she has made the object of her policy in the Far East for the last thirty years, and, as pointed out above, the international policy so carefully constructed at the Washington Conference now lies in ruins. Nevertheless, America will not fight, but, in any struggle between Soviet Russia and Japan, America will back Soviet Russia by any means short of actually taking the field. When the present naval limitations come to an end un 1936, there may be something like a race for naval supremacy between Japan rand America, and there will probably be a strong American fleet permanently j stationed in the Pacific. The hostility of America combined with the economic interdependence of America and Japan must be a source of acute anxiety to Japanese statesmen. In this connexion it is significant that America and Soviet Russia are already drawing nearer together; recognition of the latter by the former may be an accomplished fact before many months are past.XIII. British Interests in China; Future British Policy.The trade of the United Kingdom with China is of the same order of magnitude as its trade with Japan or with the Netherlands East Indies. British exports to each of these countries in the year 1929 amounted to roughly 7 million sterling. Yet when we speak of British interests in the Far East it is always and solely our interests in China that we have in mind.   Whereas British trade
with Japan or the Netherlands East Indies as with most other countries can be left more or less to look after itself and does not require for its protection incessant anxious thought on the part of Government Departments in Whitehall, in the case of China our &apos;&apos; interests &apos;&apos; depend to an extraordinary degree upon the policy adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. This is not entirely due to the size of the British investment in China. This consists of railways, land and buildings, banking, insurance, shipping, &amp;c. It is estimated to amount to between 250 and 300 million sterling a sum that is often described as &quot; enormous.&quot; Whether this is really enormous compared with similar investments in other countries may perhaps be open to doubt, but in any case the reason for this intense preoccupation with China must be sought elsewhere. The special peculiarity of the position in China that has always distinguished it from all other countries is that foreign trade with China depends on the immunity of the foreign merchant residing and trading in China from vexatious interference at the hands of the local Chinese authorities. Whether British piece-goods are sold in, say, South America depends upon whether they can compete in quality and price with similar goods on the same market. In China the further condition must be satisfied that the local British merchant must receive from his home Government a quite extraordinary degree of protection. His person, his business and his property must be immune from the jurisdiction of the native courts and be subject solely to the jurisdiction of British courts specially established on Chinese soil; his income and his trading operations must, in general, be immune from the exactions levied on native enterprise, and even when it is agreed that he shall be subject to the same taxation as the Chinese the intervention of the British authorities is invoked to a quite extraordinary degree to ensure that he shall not be made the victim of arbitrary treatment at the will of some local despot. In certain important localities the foreign merchants are allowed to make their own arrangements for policing, lighting, sanitation, &amp;o, and from these areas Chinese jurisdiction is practically ousted altogether. The main problem of British policy is how to maintain these privileges without unduly antagonising the rising nationalist s&quot;pirit of the Chinese. It is not merely a case of preventing the unilateral abrogation of these privileges; for the privileges might remain nominally intact but without a certain amount of goodwill on the Chinese side they would be of little benefit to the British merchant concerned. It is a delicate task to retain just that degree of special privilege that is essential and yet retain the goodwill of the Chinese. The British Government must therefore take incessant anxious thought for their policy in China, and the justification for the apparently disproportionate amount of time and trouble devoted by successive British Governments to the problem of China is not the present but the potential value of the China trade. This was true ninety years ago, and it is still true to-day. The foreign trade of China has increased absolutely, but not relatively, and it is still but a minute fraction of the total trade of the world. Only the surface has been lightly scratched and the potentialities once a reasonable degree of order and political stability has been attained are still illimitable.In recent years the importance of the local British merchant in relation to the foreign trade of China has tended to diminish. There has been an increase in direct trading between China and the United Kingdom, with a corresponding-elimination of the local British middleman. As Chinese merchants have embarked upon foreign trade they have increased in importance and influence, and their operations have tended less and less to be hampered by vexatious restrictions and exorbitant exactions. In proportion as the more flagrant abuses of former times are suppressed by the Chinese in their own interests, the need for special protection for the foreign merchant is gradually diminishing. In -certain circumstances it is found to be wiser voluntarily to accept Chinese -conditions rather than provoke hostility by attempting to insist on the strict letter of treaty privileges. Moreover, the local British merchant is no longer to the same extent as formerly engaged in purely British trade; he may be sending Chinese wool to America or selling American locomotives to the Chinese, or he may be engaged in developing some local Chinese industry, and in all these cases he is not contributing directly to the trade of the United Kingdom. To some extent, therefore, conditions in China are tending to approximate to those in more normal countries, where constant and vigilant protection of the local British - community is not necessary in order to maintain the trade of the United Kingdom. But this process has not gone very far, and its progress is not likely to be very
rapid. For a considerable time to come extra-territoriality or something equivalent to extra-territoriality, though perhaps with a different name will have to be maintained. The concessions that were of no value have been returned, those that remain will have to be retained; in particular, there can be no substantial diminution of the foreign control over the administration of the International Settlement at Shanghai without risk of serious disaster. These are matters which must continue to engage the constant attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The maintenance of the British position in China will continue to be as important in the future as it has been in the past. Its importance is not to be measured by the cash value to the trade of the United Kingdom of the activities of the local British merchant in China, it is determined rather by such imponderabilia as national prestige. A conflict is looming ahead between Russia and Japan. There may be further conflicts arising out of the vast potentialities of China, for no one yet knows what is going to take the place of the Washington Conference policies that have now been torpedoed by Japan. The repercussions of these conflicts even if they are not all armed conflicts will be world-wide, and it is essential that Great Britain should retain her influence her moral influence above all and be able to speak with authority.If Great Britain is to retain her position and maintain her prestige in the Far East she must endeavour to gain and keep the friendship and goodwill of China. This, it is submitted, should be the key to our whole future policy in the Far East. It is a simple policy that cannot involve us in any embarrassing commitments; one that can be followed by keeping a few copy-book maxims in mind, and one that will not lead us into devious ways. Without the goodwill of China it will not be possible to obtain fair treatment for British trade and enterprise. To gain China&apos;s goodwill, all that is necessary is to show our sympathy with to use the stock phrase the legitimate nationalist aspirations of the Chinese people, and to use our influence to secure for her justice and fair play in her international relations. Fine words, of course, will not suffice; our sympathy must find expression in practical measures.XIV. British Policy: A attitude towards China, Japan and A merica.There is some danger in attempting to lay down too rigidly the lines of future British policy in the Far East, for, however much thought may be devoted to the problem, it is hardly possible to diminish in any sensible degree the amount of study that must be given to each problem as it arises in order to find the appropriate solution. In a sense our policy must always be opportunist, and each problem must be considered on its merits in accordance with the particular circumstances of the time. All that is possible in any general study of the question is to paint in a background against which the problems as they arise may be viewed in right perspective. In the Far East our problem may be stated as the problem of correlating our attitudes towards America, Japan and China.There is a school of thought which looks back with regret to the days of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and believes that the right policy for this country is to cultivate the closest friendship with Japan. These are the counsels of sentiment and not of wisdom. No country has rendered greater service to Japan than Great Britain. But even in the days when Japan remembered that she owed her existence to us the policy that she pursued made the connexion between Great Britain and Japan a source of embarrassment. If it were possible to gain her friendship once more the same results would follow. The Japanese are the most ego-centric race on earth not even excepting the French. As a high authority has recently told us, the happy temperament of the Japanese is due to the fact in religion they have never teen tortured by a sense of sin. In politics they are similarly blessed with a happy belief that whatever is for the good of Japan must be right, and no amount of friendship would ever make them see events through other than Japanese spectacles. They are certain in the future even more than in the past to pursue policies that will arouse distrust, fear and resentment, and that will make it impossible for a country with traditions such as ours to link our fortunes with theirs. So far as a due regard for our own interests will (permit we should of course adopt as friendly and considerate an attitude as (possible towards Japanese interests, but it will not be possible to make our general j policy in the Far East conform to that of Japan.
In the case of America, on the other hand, her general aims and her attitude towards China are the same as ours. She is, however, obsessed with a deep-seated hostility towards Japan which often finds expression, even in official utterances where greater restraint might have been expected, in criticism and condemnation; she often suggests as a common policy courses of action that can have no ameliorative-tive effect, but are likely to cause dangerous tension in international relations; and having induced others to engage with her in a common policy, she is not unlikely to drop out and leave her associates to pursue it alone. In view of the possible conflict between Japan and Soviet Russia and America&apos;s probable attitude thereto, great caution will have to be observed in our relations with America. We may sail the same general course, but we should at all times retain full control of our own vessel.The question of our attitude towards China has been discussed in the preceding paragraph and the whole matter may now be summed up as follows : Towards Japan we should be considerate, but not subservient; we should endeavour to co-ordinate our policy with that of America, but refuse to be drawn into intemperate courses; we should be sympathetic towards China, while making it clear that friendship does not imply surrender of essential British interests or absolve China from responsibilities in the domestic and international fields which properly rest on her shoulders.J.

(14323)[F 7858/7858/61] No. 3.Memorandum respecting the Population and Raw Materials in the Far East.SELF-PRESERVATION is for nations, though not for individuals, the strongest and most constant of instincts. It is chiefly here that the analogy between personal and national policy breaks down; it is this that hampers the idealist in his attempts to enforce a parallel between private and public morality. Since history began to be recorded there have been countless individuals, even groups of individuals, ready to sacrifice their lives in the pursuit of an ideal or for conscience&apos; sake; extend the individual to form a nation and the case is altered. Although there may have been examples of peoples and Governments willing to risk serious disadvantages for the sake of a higher good, there have been few, if any, who have deliberately sought out or willingly accepted a risk to their very existence.Caution is necessary in the practical application of these general observations to concrete cases. Talk of &quot; absolutely vital interests &quot; is apt to be used to excuse mere national egoism; propaganda about the necessity for &apos;&apos; outlets&apos;&apos; has been known to cover imperialistic designs hardly calculated to benefit the nation as a whole. Several German writers before 1914 contended that their country was overpopulated, and that more colonies were essential not to its prosperity alone, but to its very life. In that extreme form the demand was obviously unjustified, but it is a moot point whether other things being equal, the continuous rise in both population and standard of living that had taken place in Germany since 1870 could have been carried much further without the opening of new sources of wealth for the German people. It was, however, willingness to forego increased comfort or luxury that was at stake never Germany&apos;s &quot;vital &quot; interests.In the past seven or eight years Japan has raised, more urgently, a somewhat similar problem for the world, and most discussions about Far Eastern political or economic conditions begin with or at least inevitably lead up to a consideration of the Japanese population problem. A few figures will reveal its essential features. The area of Japan is rather larger than that of the United Kingdom, being 147,651 square miles (colonies excluded) (less than California and half the size of New South Wales). Only about one-sixth of this is cultivable say, approximately 60,000 square kilom. This gives these are League of Nations figures for 1927, since when the position has undoubtedly become more unfavour-able a population of 993 persons per arable square kilom, which may be compared with 800 for the United Kingdom, 640 for Belgium, 307 for Italy and 305 for Germany all alleged to belong to the fully or over-populated category of countries. In 1878 the population of Japan was about 31 millions; it reached double this figure in 1928, just fifty years later. The population in 1932 was q Q-frt&amp;OtfeO, the excess of births over deaths being 1,007,868. In 1928 the birth rate was 34-4 per thousand, that of England being 16-7 for the same year. In 1932 the birth rate had declined to 32-92 per thousand, but the death rate also from 18 - 98 to 17 -72 (Tokyo despatch No. 441 of 28th July, 1933). Certain statisticians have argued that by 1957 the Japanese population will be at least 90 millions. It may be true that in nothing is the truth of the joke about lies and statistics, at least certain kinds of statistics, more to the point than in regard to population, but it appears that the Japanese Government have seriously reckoned with an increase to 80 millions in the next twenty years. In the most elaborate book on the subject, W. R, Crocker&apos;s Japanese Population Problem (London 1931), apparently sound evidence is produced of a gradual decline in the number of Japanese marriageable women already a less proportion of the total population than in France (forty-seven as compared with fifty-two) a diminution in the rate of fecundity, which rose until 1908, and has been falling ever since and a retardation in the average age of marriage. All three factors apart from contraception, the influence of which is, according to Crocker, in some dispute among the experts-militate7167   [994 s-1] b9722
against a prolonged annual increase in Japan&apos;s population at anything like the present rate.The prospects of stabilisation are, nevertheless, not very near. A decline of the birth rate, even if artificially exaggerated, would contend with two factors making for increase over at least the next fifteen to twenty years. These are the age composition of the Japanese population and the decline of the death rate. As to the first reliable statistics show that while the reproductive group in Japan is to-day smaller than in Western Europe, the group of women reaching reproductive age during the next eight or ten years is very much larger. Of Japan&apos;s total female population in 1925, 36 per cent, were aged between 1 and 14 years, compared with 21 for France in 1921. In Japan, too, the percentage of the whole population aged over 50 was in 1925 only 15, as compared with France&apos;s 25 per cent. The figures point to a growing and a declining population respectively, over the next decade or two. Japan, in short, since Western countries opened her gates to their type of civilisation it is interesting to record that before her westernisa-tion she achieved a measure of population stability ever a considerable period  has shown all the ordinary characteristics of an industrial State; growing-industrialisation and increasing population have proved mutually stimulating (let it be remembered that England nearly quadrupled her population between 1800 and 1900); a still further increase of industrialisation should eventually lead to the population decline that has overtaken or promises to overtake all highly industrialised States.It is, from some points of view, seriously misleading to treat the Japanese population or industrial problem in isolation. It is only a part although admittedly a most important and striking part of the Far Eastern problem as a whole, and before discussing the methods by which Japan has proposed to relieve lier population-pressure we may look at conditions among some of her neighbours. It has been suggested that the Chinese also have a population problem, and certainly famine is a more or less recurrent event among this vast people, numbering more than 480 million (114 estimated to the square mile in 1932, compared with Japan&apos;s 436). But although in the absence of unified administra-tion and reliable statistics, and also in view of the low Chinese standard of living, it is difficult to arrive at settled conclusions on all the various aspects of the Chinese population question, it is generally agreed that the Chinese problem is relative, mainly a problem of distribution. The Chinese differ from the Japanese in having become a migratory people, bound as ever to their family life, but now not as tenacious of their native soil. The migration into Manchuria, in which 2 million Chinese have settled during the past eight years, has been described as the most remarkable example of national migration in history, and it may be mentioned that this movement, which, after reaching the tremendous total of about a million in 1927,(1) slackened during the dispute between Japan and China, has recently been resumed. The number of Chinese who live far from their own country, too, is worth noting; it is the origin of most of China&apos;s invisible exports, overseas remittances playing no inconsiderable part in reducing China&apos;s adverse trade balance. The number of Chinese in the Far Eastern countries is variously estimated : certainly the number generally given (1930 figures) for Siam and Indo-China 500,000 and 230,000 respectively is an under-estimate, and the most recent authority, Reiner, in his Foreign Investments in China (New York, 1933), gives reasons for putting the figures at 1^-2 millions and 500,000. In British Malaya, the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines the figures are definitely known, and are as follows : 1931, British Malava : 1,709,392 (40 per cent, of total).1930, Netherlands East Indies : 1,233,856 (about 300,000 in Java alone).1918, Philippines: 50,826.The total number of Chinese resident abroad (apart from Manchuria, of course) is estimated at approximately 9 millions. It would be untrue to say that their national sentiments are dormant : since the establishment of the Kuomintang they have, in fact, been decidedly vigorous, but the political risk of large bodies of Chinese population has always been outweighed by the tremendous advantage to the rubber and tin industry under the British and Dutch flags, and to the mining and agricultural industry under Japanese control in Manchuria, of having such(!) See 0. W. Young: Chinese Colonisation in Manchuria, in Problems of the Pacific (Chicago).
a cheap and docile labour force at disposal. (2) The equanimity with which the very large compact bodies of Chinese in foreign countries are viewed may be compared with the disquiet expressed by Americans over the fact that the popula-tion of Hawaii is about 40 per cent. Japanese. It has been publicly stated (by Professor Bailey, of the University of Hawaii, speaking at the Institute of International Relations meeting held at San Francisco in 1930) that it is this that retards Hawaii&apos;s admission to statehood, since there is a fear that some day Hawaii may elect a Japanese Governor. In 1930 there were 139,651 Japanese in Hawaii (Honolulu despatch No. 20 of the 24th August, 1931), but the percentage of the total population had dropped to 37 - 9 from 42 - 7 ten years previously.Before returning to the question of Japan, attention may be called briefly to the population question in the Dutch Far Eastern possessions. Of these Java, about a quarter the size of France, with its 40 millions of population, is generally regarded as over-populated, although its productive capacity in rice is much less than half that of Japan (970 lb. to the acre, compared with 2,510 1927 figures). The other islands, however, are comparatively under-populated, and the Dutch have been endeavouring to promote a migration from Java to Sumatra, without much success. It has recently been considered  -ed necessary, after years of complete freedom,(2) to impose immigration quotas for Chinese and Japanese. The former already dominate a great part of the colonies&apos; domestic economy, but the latter, although they have made their competitive power seriously felt in commerce and shipping, and are credited with political designs in some quarters, particularly in view of the oil resources, have shown no sign of making these territories an outlet for surplus population. In 1930 (Batavia despatch No. 10 of the 15th January, 1931), there were only 6,973 Japanese in the whole territory.At this point we may return to the Japanese problem. It has been suggested that the cry of over-population may have been raised for purely imperialistic purposes. The suspicion seems to lie less against Japan than other countries. From a very informative chapter in Crocker&apos;s book on the Japanese food problem, the following striking table may be taken : Arable Land to One Farmer.Acres.United States ... ... ... ... 31-7Denmark ... ... ... ... 16-2France ... ... ... ... 6-1Italy ... ... ... ... 31Japan ... ... ... ... 0-9It is impossible to resist the conclusion that Japanese farms have been sub-divided to the furthest possible limit. Japan is still a predominantly agricultural country about 50 per cent, of the population, compared with France about 40 per cent., England and Wales about 7 per cent. but the Japanese peasant is working on an area less than one-sixth that of the French peasant, and he is supporting a much larger family than the Frenchman. That lie has hitherto done this successfully is due to the tremendous development of sericulture, without which the pressure of an excessive number of farmers on the land would have led to disastrous results. The fact that about 80 per cent, of Japan&apos;s silk exports go to the United States has stood between the Japanese farmers and collapse, but the situation is obviously hazardous.Thanks to a truly remarkable expansion of productivity the yield of rice per acre in Japan has been doubled in the past fifty years, and is now easily the highest in the world (2,510 lb. per acre, compared with United States 1,130 lb. and British India 805) Japan has so far managed to keep her food imports at a comparatively low level,(3) compared, say, with the United Kingdom (41-2 per cent, of total exports in 1921). In 1932, according to a note by the commercial counsellor enclosed in Tokyo despatch No. 146 of the. 3rd March, 1933, food supplies to the value of 150 million yen were imported, this being 10 per cent, of the total imports, while Crocker shows that nearly one-fifth of(a) See J. L. Duyvendak : Dutch Colonial Administration in the Far East (Proceedings of Institute of International Relations, 1930).(&apos;) Possibly the chief reason why her internal price level has not risen consequent on the fall of the yen.[994 s-1] b 2
the staple diet, rice, is being imported. It is generally accepted, however, that, on the present manner and standard of living and the latter, although it has progressed during the past twenty years, is generally regarded as low by most Western standards the law of diminishing returns and the inevitable increase of population must make the curve of Japan&apos;s dependence on imported food continue to rise, probably steeply.Various ways are suggested of meeting such a situation. Two, mentioned by Crocker, of increasing productivity by increased fertilising, and a change of staple diet (&quot;rice is a costly cereal&quot;), may be dismissed as offering little possibility. A third, bringing a greater acreage under production, is more practicable. Over half of Japan is under forest, and the inclement and largely uncultivated northern island, Hokkaido, has a population density of only 28 to the square kilometre, as compared with 157 in the main island. The possibilities have been explored by the Japanese Government, though more might perhaps be done. Between 1915 and 1925 the total of arable land was increased by 3-5 per cent., but since that the additional acreage per annum has been getting steadily smaller, and Crocker brings evidence to show that official statements that, for various reasons, due to climate or the nature of the soil, efforts to expand will achieve little or nothing in this direction, and that any increase of acreage will be only at a high cost of production, rest on a solid foundation. Already foreign rice is cheaper than the home product, and the Government has had to resort to devices to keep up the price of the latter, which is now, strictly speaking, grown on an uneconomic basis. The parallel with England at the time of the corn laws is too obvious to need elaboration.There remain three further methods of dealing with the situation colonies, emigration and industrialisation. In recent years Japan has been obtaining from Korea and Formosa about two- thirds of her imported rice supply, and it is agreed that the productive capacities of both territories are capable of considerable expansion. Even so, however, it is held by most students of the situation that the filling of the gap is likely to be of comparatively short duration, for Korea&apos;s population is expanding more rapidly than Japan&apos;s, and both Korea and Formosa, in order to replace the rice they export, themselves are compelled to import a lower grade of cereal, millet. A rise in the extremely low standard of life would mean a demand for the rice that now goes to Japan. As to emigration, it is often asserted that Japan has not gone very far to meet her problem by this method, and statistics seem to support this. Certainly the planting of colonists from Japan in the territories she has acquired has made little progress. Of the respective populations, Korea 21 millions, and Formosa about 4-6, Japanese form an insignificant proportion. In 1925, it is pointed out in the 1933 edition of Sir Norman AngelFs Great Illusion, Japan had possessed Korea for nineteen years, and there were only about 400,000 Japanese; Formosa for thirty years, and Japanese there numbered about 184,000. The fact is accounted for not only by climate, but by the impossibility of Japanese maintaining themselves side by side with enormous populations with a much lower standard of living. This lies at the root of the emigration problem. With few exceptions, lands which might be practicable or suitable for Japanese are barred to them, while great territories, such as Manchuria, have been made attractive to Chinese, but not to the Japanese. The colonial history of Manchuria goes back for many years, but it is largely owing to the comparatively recent effects of Japanese administration that it has shown such remarkable development from 14 millions in 1900 to nearly 30 millions to-day, nearly all Chinese, the Japanese numbering only about 200,000, most of them of the official and administrative class. In his book Crocker names four territories which appear to offer facilities for Japanese emigration, namely, North-Eastern Asia (Manchuria, Inner Mongolia and Siberia), the East Indian Islands (especially Borneo and New Guinea), the South Pacific Islands and Brazil. It is unnecessary to discuss these possibilities in detail; it is sufficient to say that the exploitation of all of them would demand considerable changes in the international situation and that there is fairly general agreement that even on the most favourable terms emigration can be no more than a slight practical remedy, though as a psychological palliative it is certainly not to be under-estimated. The liberal attitude of Brazil in this connexion (100,000 Japanese settled) deserves to be noted.It would be strange if the situation were otherwise; in no case in modern times, except perhaps Ireland and Shantung (millions of whose inhabitants went
and found their livelihood in Manchuria), has emigration been adopted as an effective means of meeting the problem of an unbearable strain on natural resources. Western countries, such as those Japan has taken for her model, have all chosen the path of industrialisation, and Japan has followed. The gravity of her competition with European industry has suggested that she is already far on the road, but the facts point to a contrary view. The 1920-21 figures showed 55 per cent, of the population engaged in agriculture, and only about 20 per cent, in industry, compared with the United Kingdom&apos;s nearly 40 per cent., and Germany&apos;s 38. In more recent years there has been a decided advance, and the increase in, say, raw cotton imports from about 3 million quintals before the war to 7 million in 1927 show that the change-over from an agricultural state to a partly industrialised one has been rapid and in excess of the rate of growth of population. It is, nevertheless, true that Japan is far from having industrialised herself to capacity, and there is evidence that the authorities are hesitant and apprehensive of the future of the country&apos;s agriculture in the event of more intense industrialisation. Japan is confronted with England&apos;s early 19th century dilemma, but she has to make her choice at a far less favourable moment, since vast colonial expansion is denied her, while competition is keen, not only on the part of rivals already in possession of the field, but by newcomers. Japan is alive to the dangers of the industrialisation of India and China. For her, with her comparatively slender foreign investments and natural resources her capital gains of wartime have been largely locked up in industry and are irreplaceable unless her industry succeeds or she is presented with the opportunity of another European war economic nationalism in countries of lower standards of living than her own is full of peril. Experts, such as Mr. Foster Bain, who is mentioned again below, may prove that despite vast reserves of coal and iron, the Far East, because of the inferior workability of its resources, can never compete in large-scale industrialisation with the Atlantic countries, but this opulent American optimism can be of little practical interest to Japan.Short of a complete change of system and there are signs that the Govern-ment would not hesitate if necessary to embark on a vast system of State control in the face of intense opposition from industry which is still to a remarkable extent in private hands a prudently-conducted policy of increased industrialisation and exploitation of foreign markets appears to be marked out for Japan. In this, like Italy, she has the advantage of cheap and abundant water-power (potential 4-5 million horse-power, compared with Italy 3-8, and United Kingdom -85). This is her one notable material asset. In the essential mineral fundamentals of modern industry, as H. Foster Bain&apos;s Ores and Industry in the Far East (New York: 1933 edition) shows, she is singularly deficient in relation to population. In coal, iron and steel her present production and estimated reserves are in marked inferiority to all her neighbours, and indeed, to practically all countries reckoned as industrial or partly industrial except Italy and Holland. When to this inadequacy which has not prevented Japan from attempting to build up an iron and steel industry on modern lines there is added the lack of other essential raw materials such as cotton and wool, it is clear on what a precarious foundation the Japanese industrialising programme rests. Her dependence on foreign sources implies, it is true, a certain obligation towards her on the part of the exporting countries one need only recall the intense interest of the Indian cotton-grower and the Australian sheep-raiser(4) in Japanese industry but the margin -of security is regarded as small, and the supposed threat of an economic boycott by the League of Nations this year, which propaganda duly exploited, led to-something like panic.Here is the key to the understanding of Japaifs interest in Manchuria, where far-sighted investment has already given her, some years ago, control of large reserves of coal and shale oil, and where present policy appears to ensure a complete domination of the entire potentialities of the province. It is true that, under present conditions, it is little use having raw materials without a mai-ket, and, if this were a political memorandum, it might be pointed out that there Avas a danger of Japan&apos;s Manchukuo policy compromising her far vaster stake in the immense potentialities of China as a whole on this point Bain&apos;s book has some remarkable statistics.   But political complications apart, there is no doubt(*) &quot; We are in no position to hinder Japanese trade with the object of promoting- trade with --Great Britain&quot; (article &quot; Australia and Japan,&quot; Round Table, December 1933).
that the whole of Japan regards Manchuria as a vital economic necessity for the future. Not only are the mineral resources of great importance, but the soil is a potential supplier of cheap cotton and wool, as well as food and fertilisers, which, derived from the soya bean, already go to Japan in large and increasing quantities. As a field for Japanese enterprise, too, the province, it is claimed, has tremendous possibilities. To the objection that emigration has been negligible, the answer is given that this will increase as Chinese obstruction is removed; moreover, it is the unemployed intellectuals, the potential civil servants and technicians, who should chiefly find employment there. In short, Japan seems to have convinced herself that Manchuria, with possibly, later on, Inner Mongolia, is the essential outlet for her during the next years of unavoidable expansion. As Sir Norman Angell remarks in his Great Illusion (1933 edition) : &quot; If Japan had access to new lands for settlement, and to reasonably abundant material resources, there is reason to suppose that, after three decades, its rate of growth would slacken.&quot; This may be cold comfort for the hard-pressed British manufacturer, to whom &quot; the present industrial policy of Japan and the economic security of the British Empire are incompatible &apos;&apos; (Mr. Hammersley, M.P., in House of Commons on the 29th November, 1933), but a more detached view would recognise, like a writer in the December 1933 number of the Round Table on &quot; Japan&apos;s Bid for World-Trade,&quot; that her recent trade expansion is &apos;&apos; but one aspect of that search for an outlet for her national energies, which commenced in 1868.&quot; The immediate problem is to reconcile access to that outlet with British interests and international peace. The solution will be difficult, but, on material grounds, it should certainly not prove impossibleA. W. G. RANDALL.December 18, 1933.
(14322)[F 7764/1371/23]No. 4.Memorandum respecting the Economic Position in Japan.JAPAN, after her war-time prosperity, was successively handicapped by- (1) The slump and bank failures of 1921;(2) The unsuccessful Siberian expedition, 1919-22;(3) The great earthquake of 1923;(4) The bank failures of 1927;(5) The American slump of 1929.During this period, the military powers were at a discount in Japan. Political influences, especially in foreign affairs, were Liberal; and policy, especially after the Washington Conference (1921-22), aimed at conciliation with China and a guarded co-operation with the foreign Powers. The sign of a revival of military influence was the accession to power of General Tanaka as Prime Minister in 1927 Seiyukai party in power, increased intervention in China, mission of Count Uchida to England to revive the alliance.The economic outline of Japan is very simple.First and foremost, an agricultural country, her principal crops are rice and raw silk. - The rice crop is for domestic food; it is not quite enough, and additional rice is imported from Korea, Formosa and (occasionally) Siam, Indo-China and California. Imported rice tends to depress the price of home-grown rice. Silk is used both for home consumption and export; 96 per cent, of the silk export goes to the United States of America, and the American demand decides the price.This was for many years the principal export from Japan. But in 1932 it was surpassed by textiles (cotton, silk, artificial silk).Raw cotton is imported from the United States of America, India, Uganda, Egypt, and manufactured into cloth at Osaka and other cities. Besides the home consumption, which is very large, it is exported in increasing quantities. The principal markets are British India. China.Netherlands East Indies. Egypt.Straits Settlements.British East African Colonies.But since 1931 they have been extending rapidly (to an extent which has aroused local attention) in Persia, Iraq, French Syria, Turkey, Italy, Morocco, British West African colonies, Australia. The Chinese market (except Manchuria) has, however, fallen off, owing to the boycott.Thus exports to China were 120 million yen less in 1932 than in 1930. But this loss was made up by gains in other markets, viz. :  Silk and artificial silk (rayon) are of great importance among textile exports; but they are rather less than half the value of the cotton exports. The principal expanding markets in 1932 have been British India, Australia, Netherlands EastMillion yen.British India Netherlands East Indies63 34 12 115EgyptAustralia East Africa1257166   [994 e-1]B9722
Indies, Egypt, Argentina. There was a decrease in the following : Great Britain, United States of America, Straits Settlements, Philippine Islands, France.The increase in rayon production and export is of particular importance. Exports increased from 35 million yen in 1930 to 60 million yen in 1932. Throughout 1932 there was a steady increase month by month. The industry is closely connected with the cotton-spinning industry, and is regarded with high hope.Export of woollen textiles is slight as yet, but the domestic demand is growing quickly as Japanese fashion changes in the direction of &quot; European &quot; clothes. Both woollen and worsted industries have made and are making great progress; and with them the imports of raw wool, which comes almost entirely from Australia and New Zealand a very important development in Japanese-Australian relations.Raw silk, cotton, silk and rayon textiles are of such overwhelming importance among Japanese exports that other items seem insignificant. But it must not be overlooked that Japanese exporting industries are increasing in varietj&apos; and improving in quality. Towards the end of 1932, United States manufacturers were drawing attention to dangerous Japanese competition in rubber manufac-tures, electric-light bulbs, pottery, safety matches and tinned food-stuffs.Japan is not yet a manufacturer on an exporting scale of iron and steel and machinery. This is the weakest side of her economic position. The iron and steel industry is subsidised and supported by the Government in every possible way; hut the country is dependent on imports :  Iron and United States Sweden.Machinery (not including automobiles) from United States of America, Great Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland and Sweden.The above notes show where Japan is dependent for her chief imports, viz., raw cotton, raw silk, iron and steel, machinery.The following imports may also be noted : From  Australia.steel (including pig-iron) from Great Britain, Germany, of America, Manchukuo, British India, Belgium, China,Wheat (a growing demandowing to change of taste) Beans and peas Mineral oils ...Oil cake TimberManchukuo, China.United States of America, netherlands east Indies.

Straits Settlements, Netherlands East Indies.Norway,   United  States  of  America,Canada, Sweden, Germany. United States of America. China, Manchukuo, Netherlands East Indies, British India.The above review of import and export industries shows the extent to which Japan is dependent upon foreign countries, not only for markets, but also for the supply of essential raw materials. She is entirely dependent for cotton, wool, rubber, and partly dependent for coal, iron, oil, wheat, timber and dye-stuffs.A word may be added regarding the fishing industry in Russian waters around Saghalien, Khamchatka and the Sea of Okhotsk. The right to a share in these fisheries was secured by the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905. The fish (salmon) are canned in factories built on Russian territory, and exported chiefly to Great Britain (value about  2 million per annum) and the United States ofCoal............Vegetable fibres (other thancotton) Ores ... RubberPulp for paper manufactureAutomobiles ... Oil seeds
America appearing in the Board of Trade statistics as a Russian export. These fisheries are one of the major interests of Japan in her relations with Soviet Russia, and have been the cause of much wrangling and some bloodshed in the past.It is the policy of Japan to serve her foreign trade with her own shipping, so far as possible, and, at the same time, to compete in the general world carrying trade. Shipping is directly subsidised by the Government to the amount of rather over  1 million per annum. Regular services are maintained with Europe, America (North and South), Australasia and Africa. The cheap yen has been of great advantage to Japanese shipping, and has brought back to work by the end 1932 some 50 per cent, of the shipping laid up in 1931. The two principal lines, Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Osaka Shosen Kaisha, are associated with the Mitsubishi and Sumitomo firms respectively. Government policy and natural aptitude have raised Japan to the position of third largest maritime Power in the world.Financially, Japan is less strong. Interest rates have always been high, thus indicating that capital is scarce and risk considerable. The banking structure has been weak, having the same defect as in the United States, viz., an excessive number of small local concerns. They have, however, been reduced in number since the serious banking crisis of 1927. Except for a few firms of exceptional strength, the business world of Japan is not rich; there are a few rich nobles, but a well-to-do bourgeoisie has not yet had time to form.But so far as foreign trade is concerned, Japanese banks and insurance companies play a large part; and trade is organised on a national basis, with as little dependence on foreign support of any kind as the circumstances allow.The future of Japanese trade depends upon the domestic, the imperial and the foreign market. The imperial market has been greatly extended by the formation of Manchukuo as a Japanese enclave, where Japanese trade, although not yet favoured by customs preference, is in an advantageous position. The Japanese imperial market consists of : Hokkaido and Kurile Islands (which form part of &quot; Japan Proper &quot;)Japanese Saghalien ...KoreaFormosaMandates islands (Carolines, Marshalls and Mariannes) ...Kwantung Leased Territory and Railway ZoneManchukuoPopulation. Products.Fruit, fish. 295,000      Timber, fish. 21,000,000      Rice (about 50 per cent.of total export), silk, fish-oil and manure, gold (a little). 4,500,000 Sugar (about 50 per cent, of total export), rice, tropical fruits, tea, camphor, mineral oil.69,000      Copra.1,300,000      Coal.30,000,000 Coal, iron, soya beans and products, Kao-liang timber.The Japanese imperial market is therefore of considerable extent and wealth, and compares with the British colonial empire as regards population.As regards the foreign market, the weakness of the iron and steel position has already been noted; this is a permanent and serious handicap to Japan, both as a mercantile and military Power. The foreign trade depends mainly on the export of raw silk and textiles.Raw silk is exported almost entirely to the United States of America; and raw cotton imported from that country. Japan&apos;s trade with the United States (her most important customer) tends to balance and to preserve its balance in spite of, or rather on account of exchange variations. It is almost a barter trade on a vast scale. So, &quot;economic sanctions&quot; taken by the United States against Japan would recoil at once on the American farmer.[994 e-1]b 2
Silk exports have been well maintained throughout the crisis (in volume though not in value). The volume was nearly as great in 1931 as in 1929 (the peak year), while in 1932, they were about the same as in 1927 and 1928.In 1932, raw silk exports were for the first time passed by textile exports (as a group), as the principal export of Japan. In 1931, textiles were 27 per cent, of the total, silk 31 per cent.; in 1932, these proportions were reversed. In contrast to raw silk, the market for Japanese textiles is distributed all over the world.It should be noted, however, that Japan&apos;s principal markets for textiles, viz : British India, Egypt, Netherlands East Indies, are developing their own textile industries; and clearly intend to exclude Japanese imports in their own domestic interests. The maintenance of her textile markets is therefore a vital concern to Japan a national interest as important as the retention of her hold on Manchuria.The China market, which used to be the mainstay of this trade, is now (in part) permanently lost. Compensation has to be found in Manchukuo and in other foreign markets. Hence, the sudden Japanese commercial offensive which began in 1932. The invaded markets are (some of them) preparing for self-defence ; and the first great battle has begun in British India which is the most important of Japan&apos;s foreign markets.This struggle although primarily commercial, has political implications of the highest importance. The future development of history in Japan and in the Ear East will be affected by its outcome.Population.The continuous increase of the Japanese population by about 1 million a year is the central factor of the Far Eastern situation.Japan itself is a mountainous country, fertile only in the valleys and plains; the Japanese farms are already minutely subdivided. Emigration is closed against the Japanese (1) by their own temperament (they are not good colonists); and (2) by legislation in the countries concerned against oriental immigrants.Within the Japanese imperial area, Hokkaido is too cold for the average Japanese, Formosa is too hot, while in Korea and Manchuria he cannot compete against the native races.To provide for the growing population, Japan must either reduce her already low standard of living, or develop her industries and her export trade.Budget.Japan has had to pay for her recent continental adventures by a financial policy of deficits and loans.Up to March 1932 (end of financial year) the State finances showed a small surplus of revenue over expenditure.But the 1932-33 budget, with these supplementary budgets approved in March, June and August showed the following result: Million yen.Expenditure   ... ... ... ...      1,943Revenue ... ... ... ...      1,327Deficit     ... ... ... ...        616The total borrowing consequent upon this deficit was about 705 million yen.The estimates for the 1933-34 budget, now under consideration provide for :  Million yen.Expenditure   ...         ... 2,239Revenue         ...         ...         - - 1,344Budget deficit ...         ...         ... - -        895Special accounts deficit ...         ... 93Total deficit to be met by loans ...        988
The principal items causing this increased expenditure are : Million yen.(1) Improvement of military equipment, army and navy      209 (2) Expenditure on Manchuria     ... ... 190(3) Relief of agrarian distress, &amp;c. ... ... ...      223(4) Arising out of fall in exchange ... ...        89The deficit is met in the first instance by the issue of bonds which are taken up by the Bank of Japan, who, in turn, passes them on to other banks or to the public.The loans of the commercial banks have been decreasing, whereas their deposits have increased, which seems to imply that an amount equal to the increase in deposits -plus the decrease in loans is being transferred to the Government to meet its deficit.In other words, the burden of the deficit is passed on to the shoulders of the public : (1) Inasmuch as their deposits are turned into Government obligations. (2) Inasmuch as their scope in borrowing from the banks is curtailed.If this new debt can be passed on to the public, i.e., if they will continue to invest in Government bonds, Japan will overcome her present crisis at the price of an increase in her internal national debt. No currency inflation need ensue. In Japan, as in other countries during the &quot;crisis&quot; period, there is still a good market for Government bonds since alternative investments are scarce.If the banks have to go on taking the bonds, then their liquidity diminishes and the danger of a run increases in which case the Bank of Japan would be called upon to advance currency against the security of the bonds; and such a process might lead to inflation, and a further fall in the external and internal value of the yen.The former alternative appears the more probable : The increase of the internal debt in little more than a year from 4,912 million yen to about 6,600 million yen is rather alarming; but it does not differ greatly from some of the &quot; public works &quot; programmes which have been proposed to and even adopted by Governments to meet the exceptional circumstances of the crisis.&quot; Critics of the Governments financial policy,&quot; says Mr. Sansom, &quot;point out that these sums will raise the bonded internal debt to the figure given above, viz., about 6,600 million yen; that the interest on this amount at the normal rate of 5 per cent, is 330 million, which is nearly half the present revenue from taxation; and that to this must be added interest and capital payments on the external debt of 1,398 million yen, amounting at parity of exchange to perhaps 70 million yen &apos;and at present rates to about 150 million yen. Moreover, if the new bonds are taken up and retained by the Bank of Japan, the consequent expansion of currency will carry inflation to an unsafe point, and by raising prices unduly will entail disagreeable social consequences.&apos;&apos; To such criticisms it is replied that these dangers are fully appreciated by the Government and the financial leaders, and that they are shaping their policy so as to avoid them. Thus, in addition to the open market operations of the Bank of Japan, some preparation seems to have been made for eventual loan conversion by a reduction in the rate of interest upon postal savings and by the issue in November of 200 million yen of Exchequer bonds at 4  per cent, instead of the previous rate of 5 per cent. Further, though new bond issues will be taken up in the first place by the Bank of Japan, there is no reason why they should not in part be gradually put on the market. Again, it is not certain that the whole of the loan programme will be carried out, since money made available for certain under-takings (e.g., agrarian relief, shipbuilding subsidies) may not all be required; while it must be remembered that a large proportion of the internal debt is not dead-weight war debt, but the capital of profit-making State enterprises such as railways, telephones, &amp;c. The interest on the debt is admittedly a heavy charge at present, but the yield of tax should improve as controlled inflation progresses, particularly if, as is anticipated, the present activity in productive industry develops and taxable profits increase.&quot; It may be said, therefore, that, although the financial position of Japan is difficult, it is not so serious as it at first sight appears. It even presents certain favourable aspects which are wanting in other countries.   Prices have
risen in favour of producers, there is an increase in production and an improve-ment in foreign trade and shipping. Retail prices have advanced more slowly. The employment index shows a rising tendency. There is unemployment, but it is not of great dimensions. It is probably greater than would appear from statistics, and it is serious from a sociological standpoint, but it does not at present impose any direct heavy burden upon State finances.&quot; This favourable outlook extends only to the near future. It is beyond the scope of this report to deal with unfavourable developments which may later arise from certain weaknesses in the present situation, such as the conflict of interests between agricultural and industrial workers, and the prospect, lately manifested, of continued heavy expenditure upon armaments.&quot;External Debt.The external debt is less than it was a year ago. Of the total debt of 7,375 million yen (March 1933), less than one-fifth, i.e., 1,390 million yen, was domiciled abroad, viz. : Million yen. At par. 85 million ... ... ... ... 832200 million dollars   ... ... ... 397436 million French francs      ... ... 1611,390The local Government external debt is about 230 million yen. The total long and short foreign debt is said to be 2,100 million yen. Of this, 880 million yen is said to have returned to Japanese hands; and Japan holds foreign long and short investments estimated at 800 million yen. Investments of foreigners in Japan are estimated at 250 million yen. The net external liability of Japan on long and short term account is about 700 million yen, a comparatively small burden on the balance of payments.On the credit side of the account, Japan has loans and investments abroad valued at 1,650 million yen. Nearly half of this amount consists of investments of the South Manchurian Railway Company (over 750 million yen). A large proportion of the remainder consists of investments in China (e.g., mills, wharves, &amp;c, at Shanghai and elsewhere). The situation in China and Manchuria has therefore a most important bearing upon Japan&apos;s position in international account; and therefore upon the exchange value of the yen.It would be impossible for Japan to borrow in any foreign market at present the. present yield on Japanese bonds is 6 to 7 per cent. But her productive capacity is adequate for her present needs, and for the moment she can dispense with foreign capital.Balance of Payments.On invisible current items, there is a favourable balance of about 100 million to 150 million yen. This remains fairly steady and mitigates the effect of a continuous excess of imports. A very large adverse balance of current items has in the last ten years been changed into a small surplus. The position is not unfavourable, but there is little margin for deterioration.One commodity, raw silk, accounted in 1931 for 31 per cent, of Japanese exports, not less than 96 per cent, of it going to one country, the United States. Japan&apos;s other customers (for this commodity) are insignificant, while America receives from Japan about four-fifths of her total supplies. But there is this important difference : silk is not a staple commodity in Amei&apos;ica&apos;s life, whereas it is in Japan&apos;s.Depreciation of the Yen.The above considerations lead to that of the depreciation of the yen, which next to the return to militarist policies is the most important development of the last two years.The Japanese Cabinet which took office in December 1931 reversed the deflationary policy of the immediately preceding Government, which had removed
the gold embargo in January 1930 (thus raising the exchange value of the yen to near its gold parity), restricted the note circulation and inaugurated a campaign of retrenchment.The new Cabinet, besides abandoning the gold standard on the 14th December, embarked on a policy based on wide expenditure for the benefit of agriculture and industry, which might have been expected to entail inflation. The yen. which before the 14th December had attained a, value against sterling of 3s. %d., fell steadily until August (its course during the whole of 1932 and the first months of 1933 can be followed in the attached table). However, the expected inflation did not result, the objections were obvious, for raw materials had to be purchased, the American raw silk market was inactive, and the Chinese boycott in force; the note issue was kept at its usual figure, there was no apparent increase in currency circulation, and prices did not rise. Increasing agricultural distress and general business depression brought wide relief measures, which, in the absence of new taxation and with the rising expenses of Shanghai and Manchukuo, necessitated the borrowing by the Government of 705 million yen, i.e., seven-twentieths of the budget in 1932-33. This caused some uneasiness, but the low yen was now beginning to favour industry. At the end of 1932 there appeared to be some signs of currency inflation, but it is difficult to be certain on this point; and this was accompanied by a certain rise in prices, which, however, have since fallen. The note issue had passed by a little, the fiduciary limit which had been raised in June 1932 to 1,000 million yen.The Japanese therefore have depreciated their currency externally (1) by a natural reaction from the gold standard, whereby (as with the   in the United Kingdom) the yen had been over-valued in relation to its purchasing power parity; (2) by fear of inflation (as with the dollar in the United States of America) rather than by actual inflation. The currency is well covered by gold, and the fall in the yen has added to the value of the Bank of Japan&apos;s gold reserve.For some time after the reintroduction of the gold embargo, the fall in the yen continued unchecked, and there was a tendency for capital to go abroad. &quot;This was stopped by the Law to Prevent the Flight of Capital (the 30th June, 1932). By August it had settled to about Is. 3d. to Is. 4rf. It did not decline again until the summer of 1933 when it fell, but only slightly towards Is. 2d.If only for political reasons, it is unlikely that the Government will wish to see the yen depreciate further.As for its economic value, its future course may be expected to be governed by its internal purchasing power, which in turn depends upon the progress of inflation. From calculations made in April 1933 it would appear that, on a basis of purchasing power parity, the yen was then undervalued by 27 per cent, in comparison with the   and by 35 per cent, in comparison with the dollar. The yen seems to have been over-valued in New York and London during the three years preceding Japan&apos;s return to gold, and to have remained so in the year following (1930-31). When Great Britain left gold in September 1931 the divergence of the yen-sterling rate from its purchasing power parity was aggravated. Japan left gold in December 1931. The yen rapidly depreciated, and became undervalued on the dollar and shortly afterwards on the  . Since July 1932 the divergence between the actual exchange rate and the purchasing-power, parity has been about 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, for the yen on sterling, and about 20 per cent, to 30 per cent, for the yen on the dollar. The progress of inflation was controlled during 1932, and at the present moment there is still no sign of the expected rise in price levels.The present position shows that the early violent depreciation of the yen has not been able to counteract the effects of the prevailing world depression. This is probably one reason why prices have not risen so much as expected. Unless external conditions change owing to continued or extended war expenditure or possibly a serious blow to Japanese export trade, the Government will probably be able to obtain internally sufficient funds to carry on for some months without resort to direct inflation.The fall of the yen came about through the agricultural distress of the 1930-31 period, the implications of the Manchurian advance, and the fall of sterling. Japan went one better to meet British competition in textiles. Part of her advantage (that of purchasing raw materials before the fall of the exchange) she will not have again; but she will retain the rest of it until there is a real upward move of internal prices, including wage rates.
As a matter of fact, the real revival of Japanese export trade did not begin until about August 1933, eight months after the reimposition of the gold order. In that month (owing to the &apos;&apos; boomlet&apos;&apos; in America) the price of raw silk shot up by over 50 per cent, above the preceding month; and from that time onward begins the intensive development of Japanese exports, which has led to increasing misgiving in foreign countries, especially in the British Empire.F.

(14272*)[F 7583/39/23] No. 5.Memorandum respecting the A dvent of Militarist Government in Japan.AN outline of the main political changes in Japan during the last two years shows little that is startling or revolutionary.2. A Cabinet of the Minseito party, theoretically wedded to conciliation in China, remained in office during and subsequent to the events in Manchuria of September 1931. They fell in December of that year, more as the result of personal intrigue than of any public demand for their removal, and (after consultation with the Elder Statesmen) were duly replaced by a Cabinet of the opposite party, who proceeded to convert a minority in the Diet into a majority by the usual expedient of rigged elections. Such has become the accepted constitutional practice in Japan.3. In May 1932, in the middle of the Shanghai-Manchuria crisis, the Seiyukai fell and were replaced by a Crisis Government of both parties with certain non-party men. Here, again, nothing unusual happened, since non-party men exist in every Japanese Cabinet, the Ministers for War and Marine being always officers on the active list. The Diet accepted the new Government with a good grace. Save for the absence of a general election, the situation, on the face of things, was not dissimilar to that in England in the autumn of 1931.4. In all this there is little trace of revolution. The Constitution (modelled on that of pre-war Prussia) is still intact, and all its forms have been observed. Only the weighing of certain less visible symptoms and tendencies and the correlation of apparently minor events reveal to what extent the whole fabric is in danger from a heavy shifting of the political centre of gravity from the civilian to the military side.5. Certain features of the Japanese Constitution have always given greater influence to the naval and military elements than has existed in any other country except pre-war Germany. Chief of these is the article which lays down that the Emperor has supreme command of the army and navy : &quot; A General Staff Office,&quot; say the officially accepted commentaries, &apos;&apos; has been established for His Imperial Majesty&apos;s personal and general direction of the army and navy.&quot; (There are, in fact, two General Staffs in peace-time, one for the army and one for the navy; in war time, a Grand General Staff.) The full implications of the above article have never been finally and authoritatively settled, but, in practice, it has grown to mean that the army and navy accept orders from no one but the chief of their General Staff, who, in his turn, accepts none save from the Emperor. This right of direct access means that major decisions of strategic policy may be taken independently of, or in opposition to, the wishes of the Civil Cabinet.6. A second feature, which indirectly strengthens the military parties, is the very extensive power wielded, in a negative sense, by the Privy Council, a body of retired statesmen of pronounced conservative, if not reactionary, tendencies. The Vice-President of the Council, Baron Hiranuma, is, for example, president of the Kokuhonsha, a reactionary society of ultra-nationalistic views; a staunch opponent of the political parties and persona grata with the military clique; he is even said to be a candidate for high office in the event of the establishment of a dictatorial regime.7. Article 16 of the Constitution says that the Privy Councillors shall &quot; . . . . deliberate upon important matters of State when they have been consulted by the Emperor.&quot; According to the commentaries .... &quot;the establishment of the Privy Council is just as necessary as that of the Cabinet to serve as the highest body of the Emperor&apos;s constitutional advisers.&quot; The exact functions and authority of the council have never been clearly defined, but, with the decay through death in the numbers and influence of the Genro or Council of [966 bb-1] B9722
Elder Statesmen, without whose advice no major step of foreign or internal policy has hitherto been taken, the claims of the Privy Council have gradually increased, and they aspire, when Prince Saionji dies^ to usurp the Genro&apos;s functions completely. As a consequence they have come more and more into conflict with the Cabinet. Already they appear to claim the right to approve and reject treaties with foreign countries, and to sanction new laws; and it may not be long-before they aspire to be treated (as Prince Saionji at present is) as the authority on whose advice the Government is changed. In any event, the latent hostility between Cabinet and Council aids the military in their struggle to free themselves as completely as possible from all supervision and control by the Civil Govern-ment; while the Conservative predilections of the councillors dispose them to welcome and approve a brand of military policy which purports to derive from the ideals of old Japan.8. These &quot;ideals&quot; are themselves, perhaps, the chief source of militaiy inspiration. In the words of Sir F. O. Lindley, written at a time when exaspera-tion was growing between Japan and the world at large, &quot; . . . . the spectre has arisen of a pirate and robber State returning with fierce joy to the traditions cast off so eagerly last century, and developing a policy of her own on the model of the communism of Sparta.&quot; The Japanese have always had Spartan fighting traditions, and there is a general feeling in the country that they have let themselves &apos;&apos; go soft&apos;&apos; under the allurements and material prosperity of a civilisation which is not their own, and whose spirit as opposed to its mechanics  they never should have striven to adopt. General Araki, the Minister for War and the likeliest candidate for national leader if there should be a -constitutional upheaval is the typical mouthpiece of this feeling. One of his many pronouncements, made to young officers during the Shanghai incident, is to this effect : &apos;&apos; A great proportion of Japanese people are, of late, poisoned by the utilitarian trend of thought of the West and are forgetful of the peculiar mission of the Japanese race. It was at the moment when they were indulging in the dream of inactive ease, with the country on the verge of ruin, that the present incident broke out and gave stimulus for the resurrection of the national spirit.&quot;9. The peculiar dynamic force of Japanese nationalism derives, however, in the last instance from a system of religion which fits and sublimates their fighting instincts and exalts their national traditions of devotion and loyalty. It teaches them the divine origin of the Japanese people and of their ruling-house. It teaches them also and this belief has gained in strength of recent years that Japan has a divine mission to regenerate the world, or at least the Asiatic continent. The Japanese system of education itself is calculated to keep this spirit alive. Its moral code, inculcated less by process of reasoning than by a kind of hypnotic suggestion, produces efficient and uniform instruments of national policy, citizens who, though for the most part without intellectual baggage, are frugal, virtuous and of unquestioning loyalty and obedience. It is not hard to see that a race so trained will march at the word of command in any direction and for almost any purpose.10. In spite of the features and tendencies above described, the constitu-tional system worked with fair success until the explosion in Manchuria in the autumn of 1931; at worst, it was tempered by occasional assassination and um^est. And if, as we have reason to believe, the system may be near breaking-point, it is because at the moment there is a special degree of restiveness and discontent among the officers of the fighting forces, the causes of which we must now examine.11. Apart from the general discredit of party politics due to the corruption practised and fostered by the politicians, the military conceive that Japanese honour and interests have been shamefully sacrificed by successive post-war Cabinets. Japan, having emerged from the war not merely undamaged, but better off than she had ever been before, has retained the pre-war spirit and failed to acquire that of the League of Nations. Particularly since the loss of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance the country as a whole finds it difficult to envisage Any other national policy than that of keeping herself as strong as possible on land and water.  Japan&apos;s concessions at the time of the Washington Conference
were, it appears, partly dictated by the knowledge that, at the time, her armaments were out of date and Great Britain and the United States at the probable zenith of their military and naval power. So far, no doubt, the fighting forces felt bound to accept the settlement. But no such excuse really held good in the eyes of these forces in 1930, and the Naval Treaty of that year has been the source of the fiercest criticism and discontent, leading in the first instance to the murder of Mr. Hamaguchi, the Prime Minister who had sponsored it. Needless to say, the Shidehara policy of conciliation in China, the consequent truculence of the Chinese and the whole background of the Manchurian incident were, in the eyes of the military, an even deeper source of grievance against their civilian rulers.12. A more permanent and deep-rooted cause of discontent has existed ever since the Russo-Japanese war, but has increased rather than diminished of recent years. This is the hatred of the army and navy for the wealthy capitalist classes. The former feel, not perhaps without justification, that, while it was their efforts and sacrifices which raised Japan to the status of a first-class Power, they have been cheated of almost every material advantage accruing from that status. The profits, they say, have gone into the pockets of a race of merchants, sheltered from the fortunes of war, and belonging to a class which the Japanese traditionally despise. It is stated, though with how much authority it is hard to say, that the military classes, particularly the younger naval and military officers, desire : firstly, a coup d&apos; tat to transfer the governing power from the civilians to themselves, and restrict or abolish the fortunes of the rich; secondly, a foreign war to fix them firmly in the saddle and to secure new markets and possessions for Japan; thirdly, the extensive exploitation of these markets by a system of State trading based, no doubt, on the principles of the Five-Year Plan. They are said, in fact, to aim at a kind of Spartan and communistic State, retaining the Emperor as its figure-head and inspiration. But whether such a pseudo-Soviet system would retain indefinitely its monarchical and religious features is naturally more than doubtful.13. It might be thought that fear of communism as in Nazi Germany  would have been one of the chief weapons of the military party, but this is hardly the case, so drastic have been the measures taken by every civilian Government against the Russian menace since the war.14. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the Japanese army and navy are to some extent divided into two camps. The older officers (those in the army above, say, the rank of major), while sharing the general discontent, have a high respect for discipline and order, and would probably be loth to disturb either by revolutionary methods. There are, in fact, a fair proportion of calm and sensible men in the higher ranks. But among the younger officers patriotism is a cloak for every kind of desperate act, and when they feel that those above them are going too slow they are apt to take the law into their own hands and commit the most incalculable excesses.  Such was the grim background of the Inukai murder.15. There exists in Japan at the moment a band of ruffians led by an ancient sage called Mitsuru Toyama to whom the most fulsome tributes have been publicly paid by Japan&apos;s political leaders. Assassination has always appealed to the Japanese as a means of regenerating their public life; and this man has been directly or indirectly responsible for all the big political murders of the past fifty years. The funds of his association have been maintained inter alia by blackmail levied on the political parties. His recent victims have included two Prime Ministers, a Minister of Finance and one of the most prominent capitalist leaders in Japan. The first three murders appear to have been done at his instigation by country-fellows inflamed by real or imaginary grievances, and united for the most part in some kind of &quot; blood brotherhood pledging them to lay down their lives for their country. The last murder, however, was staged and carried out by young military cadets and junior naval officers, who, not content with killing the aged Prime Minister (an early friend of Toyama&apos;s) in his house, laid bombs at the house of Count Makino, the Lord Privy&apos; Seal, and attempted to blow up various public buildings. A short reign of terror was launched in the capital before the offenders gave themselves up to the police.16. These excesses, though partly, it appears, condoned by the army leaders, proved too much for the patience of the naval authorities, who have always maintained a far more enlightened attitude towards the peculiar ethics of[966 bb-1] b 2
political assassination. At any rate, while the military conspirators escaped with purely nominal sentences, six of their naval accomplices were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of ten years and more : the result apparently of a determined effort to maintain the discipline of at least one branch of the fighting forces.17. How real the present danger is of some kind of revolutionary explosion, or at least of a fundamental alteration of the present system of government in Japan, it is hard to say. That the military at present control the Government, although the Cabinet is still predominantly civilian, cannot be disputed. Much depends on the extent to which the older and, on the whole, wiser heads in both fighting services can keep the reins in their own hands. In launching the Manchurian incident, in erecting and recognising the State of Manchukuo and inaugurating the general forward policy in China and in imposing their will in all these matters on the civilian Government, all ranks of the army were undoubtedly united. At the moment the whole army equally desire the Japanese domination of North China (whether by the erection of a vassal State under a Chinese ruler or by other means) and, in all probability, the acquisition of the maritime provinces, by means of war with Russia, if necessary.18. The senior military leaders probably desire, over and above all this, the establishment in Japan of some kind of Fascist regime of a purely militarist complexion, a corresponding restriction of the powers of the Diet and the civilian hierarchy and severe limitation (possibly by means of a capital levy) of the fortunes of the rich. General Araki, the present Minister for War, is the obvious dictator in the event of the establishment of any such regime. But beyond a programme of this kind the older people probably do not go; it is at least most doubtful how far they follow the younger officers on to the more nebulous ground of the pan-Asiatic and anti-capitalist movements.19. Some idea of the programme of the younger officers has been given above (paragraph 12). As part of it, they probably do not hesitate to foster the independence movements in India and the Netherlands East Indies; and it is not impossible that they would welcome a war with the British Empire or America, or both. General Araki himself, whose utterances are alternately those of a firebrand and of a man of sense, is to some extent associated with the younger officers and, therefore, one must presume, to some degree with the wilder of these two programmes. In any event, the whole problem of Japan&apos;s future turns on whether at the crucial moment the more moderate or more drastic views prevail.20. There are reasons for fearing the victory of the younger party. In Japan political power has always been exercised to a greater or less extent, not by those ostensibly in possession of it. but by others behind the scenes, often of no great age or rank. If, for example, one attempts to locate the present seat of power in Japan, it is hard to find it either in the Emperor, or in the Cabinet and Privy Council, or again in the Minister for War (who is by no means master in his own house); and one is almost forced to the conclusion that, in the last instance, the real masters of Japan must be some group or groups of nameless officers of no high rank.21. However this may be, there are other grounds for thinking that the future may possibly be less grim than we have imagined. The Japanese, a repressed and often inarticulate race, are constitutionally liable to fits of extreme and passing ardour of an intensity unknown in the West. When these die down their natural disposition seems to be one of gentleness and restraint. Much of the recent excitement and anxiety in Japan has sprung from the fact that she believed the world was leagued against her. In the minds of the broad masses of the nation fear of isolation has probably all along been stronger than the sudden reaction of the last two years against Western ideas. Moreover, in the seventy years of Japan&apos;s contact with our civilisation an enlightened minority has grown up who are not, we believe, prepared to abandon their ideas so readily at the dictates of a group of men whose fanaticism is based chiefly on lack of travel and ignorance of all but Asiatic ways. In this respect, the divergence between the army and navy referred to above is remarkable.22. Finally, what might be called the lethargy of the digestive process may discourage Japan from seeking fresh complications outside China, where she has already secured a good half of her utmost national aspirations. With the absorption of Manchuria and the gradual domination of North China, her hands should be full for years to come. With the prospect of successful negotiations with the British Empire on the commercial issue (the only one of importance
Foreign Office, November 25, 1933.which divides us), there seems little reason why this old friendship should not revive. Signs are not altogether lacking that Japan herself may be disposed to seek, in the revival of this friendship, a system of security and stability for the future more satisfying to her than the system of the League which she so recently discarded.R. ALLEN.
(14315)[F 7765/33/10] No. 6.Memorandum respecting Manchukuo.THIS memorandum does not pretend to give a complete picture of Manchukuo. It deals almost exclusively with facts and considerations which have arisen since September 1931. A knowledge of previous conditions, whether they still subsist in part or not, is taken for granted. It must also be particularly noted that information on recent developments is scanty, that much of it is from semi-official and unofficial sources, and that these sources are largely Japanese or Manchukuo, and therefore inclined to be optimistic.Manchukuo is only a little more than a year and a half old and it would seem desirable therefore to outline briefly the main steps which have been taken to set it on its feet as a going concern. This will simplify the subsequent consideration of the all-important question of the policy and prospects of Japan in the new State.The Development of Manchukuo.The independence of Manchukuo was declared on the 1st March, 1932, and the ex-Emperor of China, better known as Henry P&apos;u Yi, was installed as &quot; Chief Executive &quot; on the 9th March. In the succeeding few months the chief organs of the Government were rapidly organised under an Organic Law and other enact-ments pending the establishment of a permanent Constitution, the preparation of which is shortly to be undertaken. It is expected to take the form of a limited monarchy with P&apos;u Yi as Emperor.The reform of the judiciary, the revision of codes, and the training of judges and police have been considered, and will probably be put into effect in the near future. Japanese officials will be employed on a larger scale and the Japanese system will be the model.So far Manchukuo has only been recognised by Japan. This occurred on the 15th September, 1932, when a protocol was signed by which Manchukuo recognised all Japan&apos;s treaty rights and agreed to the presence of Japanese troops to sustain her national defence.Manchukuo is now divided into five provinces, one of which, Hsing-an, was carved out of the western flank of the original three. The other, Jehol, was added by conquest early this year. Hsing-an is largely inhabited by Mongols and enjoys a certain administrative independence from the Central Government. This is of importance in that the Mongolian element may be employed (by the Japanese, of course), as a counter-weight to the potential opposition of the Chinese masses in the rest of the State, and also as a lever for political aspirations further west-wards in Inner and Outer Mongolia.As regards finance the banking system was centralised and unified by the establishment of the Central Bank in June 1932. A banking law is now in preparation and its promulgation is expected to be followed by the control of foreign exchange. The currency has been unified and practically stabilised, no less than half of the masses of old notes of the inflation period, of which there were fifteen varieties, having already been redeemed. The process of redemption is to be completed next year, and the questions of adhering to a silver standard or adopting gold, and the linking of the Manchukuo yuan (silver dollar) to the yen or maintaining independence will be considered.Revenue flowed into the Treasury rapidly after the summer of 1932. Income for the financial year July 1932-July 1933 reached a total of 138 million-odd Manchukuo yuan, and the budget showed a slight surplus. For 1933-34, including some special accounts, it is apparently estimated to balance at about 200 million Manchukuo yuan.Taxes have been readjusted and the old system of farming out their collection, which involved the &quot;squeeze &quot; system, has been abolished.7151   [962 x-3] b9722
As regards trade accurate statistics are not available. The high figures of 1929 and 1930 were followed by a heavy slump in 1931. Since then a considerable recovery appears to have been made, though the previous favourable balance has fallen to a very small margin.Railway construction is being energetically carried out, and it is hoped to add 4,000 kilom. of track to the existing 6,000 in the next ten years. The follow -ing lines have already been completed : Tsitsihar-Koshun, Koshun-Hailum, Laha -Noho, and Tunhua-Korean frontier. The last-named is of great strategic importance, and communications between northern and central Japan and northern Manchukuo via north Korean ports (only Yuki at present), have been greatly shortened by its opening. Lines from Koshun to Aigun and from Harbin to Lafa have been started and the construction of the Taoan-Solun line is being continued.The making of an extensive network of roads has begun, and 4,000 kilom. are due to be finished by next summer.As regards air communications several routes, regular and irregular, are already in operation and many more are planned.in the economic field it has been decided that all the principal forms of under-taking, which are important from the point of view of national defence or public utility are to be controlled, partly or wholly, by the State. Plans are already on foot for the improvement and extension of all the main branches of economic activity, such as mining (coal, gold, iron, &amp;c), crops, live-stock, cotton, forestry, fisheries and so forth. In some cases they have already been put into effect (notably railway unification, air routes, a central bank, telegraphic and wireless telegraphic communications, coal mining, &amp;c, referred to elsewhere). Here it may be noted that two-thirds of the population is engaged in agriculture.The Manchukuo Government wasted little time in taking over the Chinese postal, salt gabelle and customs offices in their territory, and, after a certain period of disorganisation, have now restored them to satisfactory working order. Payment of a quota of China&apos;s foreign obligations secured on the customs and salt revenues was at.once promised, and sums were apparently set aside for the purpose in the budget estimates.The tariff was partially revised in July this year. Up till then it had followed the Chinese rate (as in force up till May). Substantial reduction has been made on many items. These will doubtless benefit Japan most, but may also be of some aid to British trade. A fundamental revision of the tariff is contemplated in two or three years&apos; time.Banditry is the worst evil at present afflicting Manchukuo. It was not until December 1932 that even the South Manchurian Railway became more or less safe from raids. Many parts of the country, including the town of Harbin, are still in a dangerous and lawless state. But the original number of bandits, dispersed soldiers and rebels, estimated at 250,000, is now said to have been reduced to about 60,000. The complete eradication of these, who are mostly in small bands, is, however, expected to require at least another two years.From the foregoing brief summary it will be seen that Manchukuo, under its Japanese mentors, has already made quite phenomenal strides in the first year and a half of its existence. Even if nothing beyond the unification and stabilisation of the currency and the regularisation of taxation and the reduction of military expenditure from an equivalent of 80-90 per cent, of the revenue to 30 per cent, had been accomplished. This alone would have sufficed to ensure, in anything like normal circumstances, a vast increase of prosperity. So far as the new State itself is concerned a bright future must be regarded as thoroughly assured.But this, however is not the reason for the great political importance attaching to Manchukuo. The all-important question is whether it can fulfil the role assigned to it by Japan.Japanese Policy in Manchukuo.Japan&apos;s interest in Manchukuo is partly military, partly economic. The former aspect can be dismissed briefly. In 1904-05 Japan had to fight her way into Manchuria, foot by foot. If she has ever again to face Russian aggression the position will be reversed and her task will be to defeat an invasion from the west and north.   To this end she has for many years worked hard, and is now
working harder than ever, to do everything humanly possible, chiefly by building a net-work of railways in all directions, to render the Khingan Mountains, the great natural western barrier of Manchukuo, impregnable. If Japan were the aggressor a different situation would arise No final objective lies to the westward in the endless depths of Siberia. The seizure of Vladivostok and the Maritime Province would be the goal. There are some hotheads in Japanese military circles who wish to effect this at once, but all the evidence points to the reluctance of the higher authorities to succumb to any such temptation, for the present at any rate. It is hard indeed to see how the advantages, such as they are, of seizing the Maritime Province could in any way counter-balance the moral certainty with which Japan would ultimately have to face a war of revenge. But, since most Japanese profess to regard a war as in any case inevitable, perhaps this consideration loses its validity. Russia herself is the great enigma. No one can be sure that she will not eventually advance to a degree of unprecedented power and prosperity. The Soviet Government have not, as yet, renounced the old-time Tsarist imperialism in the East. Rather have they pursued it unflaggingly and in far subtler form. Meanwhile, they have been forced to renounce their interests in Northern Manchuria. From Japan&apos;s point of view prudence demands the cultivation of harmonious relations, but fear any dictate otherwise. For the present it can only be said that both sides have their hands full and that war ought therefore to be unthinkable.Japan&apos;s other interest in Manchukuo lies in the fact that the new State is expected to bear the main burden of solving her economic problem, which in turn centres round the growth of an excess population. Every year now Japan has a million more months to feed and it seems probable that the population will have increased by 20 millions in twenty to thirty years&apos; time. After that the crisis will begin to solve itself by a greatly increased death rate. This is due to the fact that the mass of population in the prime of life or about to enter it is to-day out of all proportion to that of elderly people. Even now the birth-rate is declining, but it cannot interfere with the crisis of the next twenty to thirty years, which is the underlying cause of all Japan&apos;s recent actions. It is in fact the prime factor in the Far Eastern situation. A theoretical solution of the problem would lie in three directions, or a mixture thereof, namely, the gradual emigration of 20 million people, the extension of markets, and the obtaining of free, or at least much cheaper, raw materials. The first offers no practicable solution, unless a war is fought to obtain suitable land; . the second, so far as Manchukuo is concerned, offer considerable, though limited, scope; the third appears to have the best possibilities, and it is on this that Japan&apos;s efforts in the new State will presumably be concentrated. The potential productivity of Manchukuo is enormous, and, although some items are supposed to be deficient or, like iron ore, of inferior quality, nothing like a full survey of resources has yet been made. If the Japanese, whether working as sole concessionnaires or in nominal partnership with native interests, and whether nominally controlled by the Manchukuo Government or not, can obtain a vast supply of raw materials for the factories of Japan without having to pay profits and freight charges, &amp;c , to foreign pockets as they now do, they will have effected sufficient economies to be able to import much, of the additional food required for their increased population.Officially Japan has no say in the affairs of Manchukuo beyond the right to defend her existence by armed force. In fact, however, she controls every branch of the Government through Japanese nationals, who are regarded as having voluntarily entered the service of the new State. She also retains the rights and concessions which were held under the former Chinese regime of which the South Manchurian Railway is by far the most important, and she is now in process of organising joint enterprises, in which the Chinese will be largely sleeping-partners, for public utilities and for the exploitation of natural resources. Behind all this lies the directing authority of the army in Manchukuo which is responsible to the Government at Tokyo. The latter, in turn, is entirely subject, these days, to the will of the General Staff and the military caste.In former times the Japanese Government were represented by four separate organs in Manchuria and the Kwantung Peninsula. These were the consular officials, the South Manchurian Railway directorate, the Kwantung Army and the Civil Governor of Kwantung. In August 1932 all these functions were coordinated under the authority of one official, who became at the same time [962 x-3] b 2

Despite the alleged insecurity of conditions and the dislike of a Japanese-controlled regime, masses of coolies from North China are again beginning to find Manchuria preferable to their own purely Chinese provinces.As regards the future relations of Japan and Manchukuo there are those who consider that the new State will soon become a second Korea.   Conditions, how-Japanese Ambassador to Mancbukuo, Commander-in-chief of all troops, Governor of Kwantung and controller of the South Manchurian Railway.Jn furthering economic development the Japanese authorities at present are, it appears, being largely guided by strategic considerations, and have decided to make the South Manchurian Railway responsible for the first stage of their pro-gramme, in which the main effort is to be concentrated on railways and industries required for essential military products. They are firmly refusing to allow Japanese industrialists to erect factories and reap quick returns by exploiting cheap labour on goods which could undersell Japanese wares. It is not clear whether they are also discouraging native large-scale industrialists, if such exist, but presumably they will do so if these ever threaten to become dangerous rivals. By such means the much-talked-of &quot;economic bloc &quot; could be made a reality. In February this year a debt consolidation loan agreement was made with the Man-chukuo Government, under which the South Manchurian Railway was given administrative control of all the railways, except the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the railway debts of the old Chinese regime were consolidated at a figure of 130 million gold yen. The South Manchurian Railway also took over the contract for all new lines under construction and also, incidentally, doubled its capital. In August the Manchuria Telegraph and Telephone Company was established by the Japanese and Manchukuo Governments for the control of all forms of electrical communication. In October a company for the development of coal mining was authorised, the participants being the Manchukuo Government and the South Manchurian Railway. Other joint concerns which are reported to be under immediate consideration embrace power plants, sulphate of ammonia, magnesium, petroleum, gold, cereal crops, wool and cotton.Prior to the crisis of 1931 Japanese interests in Manchuria were reckoned at 1,600 million gold yen, and the Japanese share of Manchurian trade was some-thing over 40 per cent. The latter appears still to stand at about the same level. As to the leases of the Kwantung territory, the South Manchurian Railway and the Antung Railway, these were due to expire in 1997, 2002 and 2007 respectively. The Manchukuo Government is nowr, of course, regarded as the lessor in place of the Chinese Government. It is unlikely that the Japanese will agree to merge Kwantung into Manchukuo, unless indeed they annex the latter, but there is some talk of their surrendering their administrative rights in the South Manchurian Railway zone, together with general extra-territorial rights in the whole country. In view of the fact that the judiciary and the police will be modelled on Japanese lines and will include a large number of Japanese officials. This will not entail any real sacrifice or risk.As regards immigration, Manchukuo offers no home for the working masses of Japan. Their standard of living is too high to make competition with native labour possible. A certain number of farming colonies are, however, being sent over from Japan, chiefly composed of ex-soldiers who can form nuclei for local defence against bandits. Here it may be useful to mention the numbers of other races in Manchukuo. Mongols are estimated at about 2 millions, mostly in Hsingan Province. Koreans number three-quarters of a million, and the Japanese, of whom the vast majority are in Kwantung and the South Man-churian Railway zone city settlements, 280,000. The remaining 27 millions ai*e generally referred to as Chinese; but, in fact, a large proportion are of mixed Manchu and Mongol descent, so that although the country is culturally almost pure Chinese it is ethnically somewhat different from China proper. The figures of net Chinese immigration for the last few years are of interest. They were as follows : 
ever, are different and there is no sign of any tendency towards annexation. Quite the contrary, in view of the prospects of P&apos;u Yi being placed on the throne, a move which would give the Japanese certain tactical advantages. Moreover, the control exercised by Japan is already virtually as great as annexation could ever be expected to make it.There is a distinct probability that the Japanese will in due course extend the frontier of Manchukuo to the west by absorbing Chabar, the neighbouring section of Inner Mongolia. This would have four advantages. It would fortify the Mongol element in Manchukuo; it would interfere with the potentially dangerous line of communications connecting Soviet Siberia and Outer Mongolia with North China; it would tend to exercise a political attraction for all the Mongols, both of Inner and Outer Mongolia, in favour of Japan and Manchukuo as against Russia or China; and, lastly, it might be an added source of valuable raw materials. Any further expansion than this is not predicated by existing facts and is too speculative for consideration here.British Interests in Manchukuo.British interests in Manchukuo are small. It is impossible to say what their monetary value is, but, excluding loans, it is estimated that the maximum sum is under  6 million.In 1929 Great Britain had an 8 per cent, share in the trade of Manchuria. In 1932 this had fallen to about 2 per cent, (exports  441,000, imports  684,000). This year it appears so far to be less than 1 per cent. As regards loans  10 million in debenture bonds raised by the South Manchurian Railway in London are still outstanding. The South Manchurian Railway has also under-taken responsibility for a share of the Peking-Mukden Railway loan in regard to the extra-mural (Manchurian) section of the line. There are a few British firms owning plant or property in Manchukuo and a few which possess their own selling organisations. There are many which merely have local agents. Several insurance firms do business and two banks maintain four branches between them. British shipping, for the first eight months of this year, represented about 11 per cent, of total clearances at the three leading ports.In the opinion of His Majesty5 s consul-general at Mukden there is a future for foreign trade, but it will probably be conducted direct instead of through foreign middlemen on the spot.In accordance with the needs of the times the post of His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Mukden is being transferred from the Chinese to the Japanese consular service.The Open Door.The advantages which the Japanese have possessed in Manchuria for over twenty years in the form of experience, propinquity, shipping connexions and the ownership of the South Manchurian Railway have always made the open door a rather valueless asset to other nations. It has now been rendered almost meaningless by the additional advantages of inside control of the Manchukuo Government and a fallen Japanese exchange. The Japanese therefore have no need to close a door which could hardly be even half opened with the best will in the world. Foreign trade can only hope for a future in goods not produced by Japan.So far as British interests are concerned, the Japanese have not as yet exercised to any appreciable extent the power which they now possess to squeeze out the few lines of business which, more or less, compete with theirs. A few instances of unfair discrimination against British insurance firms are all that can be cited, and even they are not very clearly established.The Chinese Eastern Railway.For the past year the Chinese Eastern Railway (now renamed the North Manchuria Railway) has been a constant source of friction between Soviet Russia and Japan. But the former, whose anger at Japanese methods of using the Manchukuo Government as a cloak for producing an untenable position is doubtless fully justified, were forced to recognise that the time had come to dispose of a wasting asset, and an offer for sale was duly made. Negotiations to this end began at Tokyo on the 26th June between Soviet and Manchukuo representatives.
with Japanese in the part of observers and mediators. No result has yet been achieved, the main point at issue being that of the price. It is only a matter of time, however, before Soviet interests are finally either bought out or forced out.Japan&apos;s Prospects in Manchukuo.What are Japan&apos;s prospects in her Manchurian venture 1 There is no doubt that the venture will pay; but will it pay enough\ And will it pay soonl It will be no use for Manchukuo to be a Japanese el Dorado fifty years hence. The time factor is all important. The sole criterion of success, unless relief is to come to Japan from some as yet unseen quarter, is that Manchukuo must pay on a great scale and in a relatively short space of time.It is quite impossible at the present stage to hazard any definite opinion as to Japan&apos;s chances. Vast capital expenditure will be required for the develop-ment of the large and numerous undertakings now planned, and some curtailment or postponement may perhaps become necessary in order to avoid a breakdown of Japanese finances. So far no increased gains have come out of Manchukuo to balance additional expenses, which have been incurred mainly in connexion with military requirements. But the two years since the beginning of the Manchurian crisis have been exceptional, and there seems no reason to suppose that the maintenance of two or three extra divisions in Manchukuo should necessarily prove an insupportable burden. Many years will have to elapse before certain of the new undertakings, such as cotton, wool and stock improvement, can bear fruit; but, on the other hand, unless the world depression becomes more accentuated, the extremely important changes already accomplished, such as reform of taxation and the currency, unification of the railways, &amp;c, should not fail to bring a rapid increase of prosperity. This, in turn, should involve a decrease of banditry and a rise of purchasing power. It is possible that the Japanese, in trying to form an &quot; economic bloc,&quot; may find it impossible to prevent the growth of local industries competing with those in Japan. But, on the other hand, lack of honesty, capital and organising ability, not to mention influence with governing-circles, may equally well prohibit the growth of any purely Chinese large-scale industry. It is also alleged by many that Japanese plans will be wrecked by the hostility and obstruction of. the Chinese. But there is no sign of this as yet. The vast mass of peasantry and small traders have no political wishes in life beyond peace and low taxation. And these they will certainly get. The higher elements in the community will be in many cases too involved in the new order of things to dare to work for any change, and there ought, therefore, to be nothing to fear from the active hostility of a relatively small number of malcontents.Perhaps the strongest of all arguments in favour of Japan, though the least susceptible of proof, is that she will succeed simply because she is compelled to do so. &quot; Needs must when the Devil drives,&quot; and, since they emerged from a feudal condition a mere sixty years ago, the Japanese have undoubtedly shown a remarkable degree of organising ability, adaptability, perseverance and courage. They have done the impossible before now.   This should be remembered.As far as the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is concerned, it may be noted that, unless success in Manchukuo is to be followed by expansionist megalomania, it ought to lead to a definite appeasement of tension in the Par East. The problem of an excess population will have ceased to goad Japan to wild adventures. Nothing, therefore, should be done, such, for example, as an irritating and pedantic insistence on the maintenance of the open door, to thwart Japan&apos;s endeavours. On the contrary, everything within reason should be done to encourage success.  Japan&apos;s gain should, at least indirectly, be ours too.W. R. CONNOR GREEN.November 21, 1933.o
(14317)[F 7759/33/10] No. 7.Memorandum respecting the Non-recognition of Manchukuo.IN order to appreciate the exact nature of the obligation on His Majesty&apos;s Government as regards non-recognition . of Manchukuo embodied in the Assembly report of the 24th February, 1933, it is necessary to trace the genesis and development of the so-called Stimson doctrine and the part played by His Majesty&apos;s Government in this process.2. On the 5th January, 1932, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington was informed that the United States Government intended to address a note to both China and Japan on the lines of their note of 1915 (see MacMurvay, Vol. II, p. 1236), reserving all rights of the United States Government and citizens, refusing recognition of any agreements that might infringe those rights, reaffirming the principle of the open door, and containing references to the appropriate articles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Treaty of Paris. The United States Government hoped to secure the co-operation of the Governments of France and the United Kingdom. (In fact, it seems that they endeavoured to secure the co-operation of all the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty.) The relevant passage in the note of 1915 is as follows : The United States Govern-ment &quot; cannot recognise any agreement or undertaking which may have been entered into, or which may be entered into, between the Governments of China and Japan impairing the treaty rights of the United States and its citizens in China, the political or territorial integrity of the Republic of China, or the international policy relative to China commonly known as the open door policy.&quot;3. While the communication to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador was still under consideration, the United States note was actually presented to China and Japan on the 7th January, 1932. It followed the lines of the 1915 note, quoted above, and then ended with the following sentence : &quot;It (the American Government) does not intend to recognise any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the covenants and obligations of the Pact of Paris of the 27th August, 1928, to which treaty both China and Japan, as well as the United States are parties.&quot;4. The note was interpreted as an attempt to circumscribe any advantage that Japan might gain by a breach of the treaties named, but only in so far as those advantages might trespass on American interests. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment did not feel disposed to associate themselves with this demarche, firstly, because, as a member of the League, they did not wish to take action independently of the League, and, secondly, because Japan had already, on the 13th October, given explicit assurances to the League that she had no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, and was the champion in Manchuria of the principle of equal opportunity and the open door for the economic activities of all nations. Each of the other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty adopted a substantially similar attitude.5. In an address which he delivered to the Council on Foreign Relations on the 8th August, 1932, Mr. Stimson said : &quot; When the American Government took the responsibility of sending its note of the 7th January last, it was apioneer.....Its own refusal to recognise the fruits of aggression might be of comparatively little moment to an aggressor. But when the entire group of civilised nations took their stand beside the position of the American Government, the situation was revealed in its true sense. Moral disapproval, when it becomes the disapproval of the whole world, takes on a significance hitherto unknown in international law.&quot; It is of the essence of the Stimson doctrine that it should be universally adopted, but at first Mr. Stimson apparently did not realise that its adoption by one or two, or even by a group of, States would not have any very7153   [990 n-1] b*9722
great effect. The first move towards securing its universal adoption was made at the public meeting of the Council of the League on the 29th January, 1932. The twelve members of the Council namely, the members of the Council other than the parties had drafted a declaration in private session. On the 29th January the President of the Council announced that this declaration, after referring to the United State note of the 7th January, stated &apos;&apos; that it would be impossible for the League to endorse a settlement secured by methods at variance with the obligations mentioned above &quot; (namely, the Pact of Paris, &amp;c). It was generally understood, though there is nothing on record on the subject, that it was the influence of the British representative on the Council that was mainly responsible for this development.6. On the 16th February the twelve members of the Council addressed an appeal to the Japanese Government, in which, after directing attention to the provisions of article 10 of the Covenant, they said : &quot;It appears to them to follow that no infringement of the territorial integrity and no change in the political independence of any member of the League brought about in disregard of this article ought to be recognised as valid and effectual by the members of the League of Nations.&quot; On the 24th February Mr. Stimson, for the first time, stated the doctrine of non-recognition in its complete form. In a letter of that date to Senator Borah he said : &quot; On the 7th January last, upon the instruction of the President, this Government formally notified Japan and China that it would not recognise any situation, treaty or agreement entered into by those Governments in violation of the covenants of these treaties, which affected the rights of our Government or its citizens in China. If a similar decision should be reached and a similar position taken by the other Governments of the world, a caveat will be placed upon such action, which, we believe, will effectively bar the legality hereafter of any title or right sought to be obtained by pressure or treaty violation.&apos;&apos;7. A Special Session of the Assembly was held from the 3rd March to the 11th March, 1932. On the 7th March the Secretary of State made a speech in which he suggested that the League should take this opportunity to reaffirm the fundamental principles on which the League is based. &quot; Changes,&quot; he said, &quot; brought about not as the result of methods of conciliation and peaceful adjust-ment, but by means contrary to the Covenant and the Pact of Paris, manifestly could not receive the approval of members of the Assembly of Nations, which exists for the very purpose of observing these obligations and these principles.&quot; At the end of his speech the Secretary of State offered to assist in drafting a resolution on these lines. The resolution adopted by the Assembly on the 11th March, 1932, declared &quot; that it is incumbent upon the League of Nations not to recognise any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the Covenant of the League of Nations or to the Pact of Paris.&quot;8. On the following day, the 12th March, the United States Minister at Berne addressed the Secretary-General of the League of Nations as follows : &quot; My Government is especially gratified that the nations of the world are united on a policy not to recognise the validity of results attained in violation of the treaties in question. This is a distinct contribution to international law and offers a constructive basis for peace.&quot;9. The Lytton Report was discussed by the Council and the Assembly during November and December. On the 13th December the Secretary of State wrote to Mr. Norman Davis a letter in which, referring to the resolution of the 11th March, he said : &quot;I repeated and adopted for myself the formula which we discussed together about non-recognition.&quot; The letter continued as follows: &quot; It would, of course, be a foolish misconception of the formula to which Mr. Stimson and I have both given our adhesion to regard it as binding the executive of our respective countries one hundred years hence to have no diplomatic relations with an area as big as France and Germany combined. The formula means, and was intended to be understood as meaning, I apprehend, that we neither of us intend to approve or support, or countenance or admit as valid, a change of circumstances which has been brought about by means contrary to the duties and the rights defined by treaties which we and others are bound to uphold.&quot; In his reply of the 14th December Mr. Norman Davis said : &quot;As to the time element involved in the non-recognition principle, it would seem that this is primarily a question of phraseology.&quot;
10. On the 24th February, 1933, the Assembly adopted a report under article 15, paragraph 4, of the Covenant. It was generally expected that in this report the Assembly would apply the doctrine of non-recognition enunciated in the resolution of the 11th March, 1932, to the specific case of Manchuria. In fact, however, the report abstained from saying definitely that Japan had been guilty of a breach of any particular article either of the Covenant or of the Pact of Paris. Their end, however, was attained by the following passage in the report: &quot; The recommendations .... exclude the maintenance and recognition *:  the existing regime in Manchuria, ....&quot; It follows that, in adopting the present report, the members of the League intend to abstain, particularly as regards the existing regime in Manchuria, from any act which might prejudice or delay the carrying out of the recommendations of the said report. They will continue not to recognise this regime either de jure or de facto. They intend to abstain from taking any isolated action with regard to the situation in Manchuria and to continue to concert their action among themselves as well as with the interested States not members of the League.&quot;11. The Secretary-General was instructed to communicate a copy of the report to the States non-members of the League who were signatories of the Pact of Paris or the Nine-Power Treaty (namely, to the U.S.S.R. and to the United States of America) with a request that they would associate themselves with the views expressed in the report and that they would concert their action and their attitude with the members of the League. The U.S.S.B. replied on the 8th March: &quot; The Soviet Government does not consider it possible to accept the decisions taken by the Assembly of the League or to take part at present in the Advisory Committee.&quot; The United States Government, in their reply of the 25th February, 1933, after recording their agreement with the League&apos;s findings of fact and conclusions, said : &quot;In their affirmations respectively of the principle of non-recognition and their attitude in regard thereto, the League and the United States are on common ground.&quot;12. From this detailed account of the manner in which the obligation not to recognise &quot; Manchukuo&quot; came into existence it will be seen that, while the United States Government may be regarded as the parent of the doctrine of non-recognition, special responsibility rests upon His Majesty&apos;s Government as being the Government that took the lead in securing the adoption of the doctrine by the League. As between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the American Government it is understood that the Assembly resolution of the 11th March. 1932, does not bind the Powers 100 years hence not to maintain diplomatic-relations with &quot; Manchukuo.&quot; The other League Powers will probably assent to this interpretation, for by the Assembly report of the 24th February, 1933, the obligation is limited to &apos;&apos; the existing regime in Manchuria.&apos;&apos; A substantial change in the character of the existing regime might be held in some, but possibly not in all cases, to release the Powers from their obligation. Thus, if the change were brought about by further acts of Japanese aggression, such as the annexation to &quot; Manchukuo &quot; of a portion of North China or the enthronement of an Emperor of &quot; Manchukuo,&quot; it would be difficult for any Power to contend that it was released from the obligation not to recognise. If, on the other hand, China caused the change by entering into diplomatic relations with &quot; Manchukuo,&quot; then it would seem that other States could do the same. But even in such a case His Majesty&apos;s Government is bound &quot; to abstain from taking any isolated action with regard to the situation in Manchuria and to concert their action, &amp;c.&quot; This might be interpreted as meaning that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not recognise unless the other States members of the League had agreed that recognition was permissible. In practice, however, it seems doubtful whether it would be possible to place so strict an interpretation upon the words in question.13. By a resolution of the 24th February, 1933, passed after the adoption of their report, the Assembly appointed an Advisory Committee to &quot; aid the members of the League in concerting their action and their attitude among&apos; themselves and with the non-member States.&quot; On the 14th June, 1933, this committee issued a report on the consequences that might be involved for[990 n-1] b 2
Governments by the non-recognition of the existing regime in Manchuria. The report dealt with the following matters :- (1) Conventions. The Powers should take all possible steps to prevent the accession of &apos;&apos; Manchukuo &apos;&apos; to certain general international conventions, a list of which (including the Universal Postal Union) was given.(2) Postal Services. The committee reminded the Powers that &quot; Manchukuo &quot; is not a member of the Universal Postal Union.(3) Currency. Transactions in &apos;&apos; Manchukuo &apos;&apos; currency should not be prohibited by law, but official quotations in &apos;&apos; Manchukuo &apos;&apos; currency should not be admitted.(4) Nationals of States members of the League are not prohibited from entering into contractual relations with anyone in Manchuria.(5) Passports. -&quot;Manchukuo&quot; passports cannot be visaed, but inhabitants of Manchuria may receive an identity document or laissez-passer from the consul of the country which he wishes to visit.(6) Cdnsuls. The Powers may replace their consuls in Manchuria, but should avoid doing anything which might be interpreted as recognition, express or implied.(7) Opium. Applications for the export to &apos;&apos; Manchukuo &apos;&apos; territory of opium or other dangerous drugs should not be granted unless the applicant produces an import certificate in accordance with the Geneva Opium Convention of 1925 of such a nature as to satisfy the Government to which application is made that the goods in question are not to be imported into &quot; Manchukuo &quot; territory for a purpose contrary to the convention. A copy of the export authorisation should accompany the consignment, but Govern-ments should refrain from forwarding the second copy of the export authorisation to &quot;Manchukuo.&quot; Copies of the report were sent to States members of the League, as well as to the U.S.S.R. and the United States of America, with a view to their adoption of the measures recommended. The U.S.S.R. has not so far replied, but the attitude of the United States of America is somewhat equivocal. The United States Minister at Berne has advised the Secretary-General &quot; that the views of the American Government in regard to the principle of non-recognition remained unchanged, that the American Government concurred, except in a few particulars, in the conclusions arrived at by the Advisory Committee, and that the procedure followed by the American Government was in substance in accordance, except in a few particulars, with the procedure recommended by the Advisory Committee.&quot; The net result would appear to be that the United States Government intend to keep a free hand as to how the doctrine of non-recognition is to be interpreted in practice.14. Difficulties have arisen in connexion with postal facilities, a matter in regard to which the committee&apos;s recommendation (see paragraph 13 (2) above) was of no practical value. Letters are being sent from Manchuria to other countries bearing &apos;1 Manchukuo &apos;&apos; stamps. According to the Postal Union Convention letters are delivered without surcharge unless marked &quot; T&quot; by the office of despatch. Letters from Manchuria arriving via China are marked C&apos;T,&quot; but those arriving via Japan are not so marked. It has been decided by this country and by France and probably by other countries to ignore the marking of the Chinese Post Office and deliver such letters without surcharge. A further difficulty has now arisen. Communications have been received by the postal authorities of various countries from &quot;the Department of Communications of Manchukuo&quot; requesting to be furnished with statistics in accordance with the provisions of the Postal Union Convention, with a view to the liquidation of the transit payments due in respect of mails sent through Manchuria. In view of the importance of maintaining the present postal transit facilities across Manchuria, it has been decided to ask the Advisory Committee to give a clear definition of the extent to which de facto relations may be permitted between foreign postal administrations and the postal authorities in Manchuria.15. The decision of the Advisory Committee in regard to opium (see paragraph 13 (7) above) might seem open to criticism on the ground (inter alia) that the procedure recommended came very near to recognition. It will be difficult to avoid similar criticism in any decision that may be given by the committee or in any action that may be taken by the Powers in regard to postal
facilities. So long as &quot; Manchukuo &quot; is in fact a State with a stable Government it will become in practice more and more difficult to ignore its existence. It is probable that other States will gradually drift into relations with Manchukuo indistinguishable in practice from the relations they have with States whose Governments have been formally recognised. In the meantime Soviet Russia is free to recognise at any moment that it suits her policy to do so, and the United States Government in their communications with the League would appear to have carefully chosen their language so as not to fetter their future action.December 13, 1933.J. T. PRATT.
(14316)[F 7760/7760/61] No. 8.Memorandum- respecting Russia in the Far East.1. Soviet Activities in China, Mongolia and Japan.SHORTLY after the war the Soviet Government voluntarily renounced their extra-territorial and other special treaty rights in China, and declared that thenceforth Russia would take no further part in the capitalist and imperialist exploitation of the East. The treaty rights were duly abolished, but, owing to the nature of Russian interests in China, this involved no loss except perhaps to some extent in the case of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which was the backbone of the old &quot;sphere of influence&quot; in Northern Manchuria. &quot;Imperialism,&quot; however, was in no way forsworn, but soon reappeared in the far more dangerous guise of political subversion, and was much more ably conducted and more ambitious than the rather clumsy efforts of Tsarist days.Attention was first directed to Outer Mongolia, and by November 1921 this large and politically important territory was brought by treaty into close affiliation with the Soviet Union. Hsinkiang, another of China&apos;s outlying dependencies, has until quite recently been left alone. There is, however, no doubt that the Soviets have encouraged and even actively assisted the present rising against the provincial Government, with the object of severing the connexion between Hsinkiang and China proper and then profiting by the ensuing-chaos. The recent resumption of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations may, however, make them unwilling at present to take any definite steps towards absorbing the province into Soviet Russia.The Russian sphere of interest in Northern Manchuria was never developed except in so far as propaganda was concerned, although the Chinese Eastern Railway was, at first, a very valuable asset, not only commercially, but also from a military and political point of view. From about 1926 onwards it was clear that competing lines would soon render the railway commercially almost valueless, and with the establishment of Manchukuo last year it became evident that Japan would soon contrive to bring about its complete transference to the ownership of the new State. The negotiations for the sale of the railway, together with the question of the possibility of a Russo-Japanese war, are discussed elsewhere [vide memorandum on Manchukuo(1)).As regards Soviet attempts to bolshevise Japan, it does not appear that any great efforts have been made in this direction. The difficulties are too great. They have a certain number of disciples, chiefly amongst the younger students, and the authorities have long professed alarm at the growth of what are called &apos;&apos; dangerous thoughts,&apos;&apos; but it can quite safely be said that there can be no danger whatever of a Bolshevik revolution in Japan, or even of the establishment of a strong trades union labour party for some time to come. Ten years hence, if Japan is not beginning to solve her economic problems satisfactorily, the outlook may well change rapidly for the worse. Everything depends on a variety of unpredictable circumstances.It was on China proper that the Soviet Government concentrated all their greatest endeavours and their highest hopes. In 1926 and 1927, after two years of thorough preparation, they conducted a tremendous drive under the guise of a nationalist movement, in which all but the Chinese Communist party were duped, with the object of turning China &quot; red &quot; and thus, by dealing a decisive blow at Western capitalism, pave the way for world revolution. The plan miscarried, though by no wide margin, and the movement subsided as suddenly as it had begun. Grave embarrassments, however, were caused to the foreign treaty Powers, and in particular to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and a few indigenous nuclei were left(1) See No. 6 (14315s).7152   [990 k-1]
behind which have since carried on a precarious existence in certain areas in Central and Southern China as self-styled Communist &quot; Governments.&quot;Sporadic efforts to exterminate them have been made by Government troops with varying success during the last few years, and while large areas to the north of the Lower Yangtze and in the south of China have been won back from &quot; red &quot; control, the greater part of Kiangsi remains under Communist domination. Successive offensives launched by Chiang Kai-shek in this difficult mountainous terrain have been repelled with heavy loss to the Government troops, and while a policy of blockade has now been adopted with some prospects of success, the situation has lately been complicated by the formation in Fukien under the aegis of the xixth Route Army of an independent administration of &quot; pink &quot; complexion; this new organisation has apparently entered into close relations with the Communists of Kiangsi, under the impulse of a common hostility to the Nanking Government. In West Central China large tracts of country are dominated by so-called Communist troops. The Province of Shensi is almost entirely given over to the depredations of bandits from the mountains, who, under the banner of the Third International, prey upon the prosperous valleys; some of them have lately irrupted into Szechuan and, in concert with other Communist forces evicted from Hupeh, they have created there a situation which is causing grave anxiety to the provincial Government.No less an authority than Dr. T. V. Soong once declared that the Communist problem in China was not merely a military one, but also politico-economic. The truth of this statement is confirmed by the fact that in provinces such as Chekiang and Kiangsu, where taxes are light and living easy, communism is almost unknown. The present so-called Communist movement in China may to some extent be inspired by Moscow, and there is undoubtedly a certain degree of pure Marxian communism in the larger towns particularly among the student class but the movement in the rural areas, which is generally identified with communism, is in fact largely an agrarian movement, an expression of the agriculturalists revolt against maladministration and capitalist exploitation in its most vicious form. The Chinese peasant is at heart essentially individualistic and acquisitive, and it is to be doubted whether, in the absence of severe economic distress, he would have any sympathy for the doctrines of State socialism and collectivisation. Could the Central Government take effective measures to relieve the distress which is at present rife in the larger part of rural China, it is more than probable that within a very few years communism as a serious problem would cease to exist.2. Sino-Soviet Diplomatic Relations.Diplomatic relations with the U.S.S.R., which had been suspended since 1927, were resumed in December 1932, but, contrary to expectation, there does not appear to have been any marked increase of Russian influence in China as a result of it. Negotiations with a view to the conclusion of a non-aggression pact and a commercial treaty have been on foot for some months past, but have not yet reached any satisfactory conclusion.3. Diplomatic Relations between Japan and the U.S.S.R.Diplomatic relations between Japan and the U.S.S.R. were established in 1925. Apart from the conflict of Russian and Japanese interests in Manchuria (see memorandum on Manchukuo(1)) and endemic disputes regarding fishing-rights off the north-east coast of Siberia, there have of recent years been no important questions at issue between the two countries.4. Soviet Propaganda in the South Seas.Considerable efforts have of recent years been made by the Communist Inter-national and its affiliated organisations to foment unrest in French Indo-China, Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. Advantage has been taken of the growing spirit of nationalism in these colonies to inspire the workers with hostility towards European imperialism, but in general the results obtained have been hardly commensurate with the expenditure, both of finance and energy, which the campaign has entailed. In Indo-China alone, where in 1928 a nationalist uprising of Communist character was suppressed by the French authorities with0) See No. 6 (14315).
great severity, has the Comintern campaign produced any visible results; and even there the movement would appear, as a result of drastic repression, to have languished in the last three years. In Malaya, despite the depression in the tin and rubber industries, communism is at the moment making little headway, while in the Dutch East Indies, functional disputes and proletarian apathy have so far held the radical elements in check.W.

(14326)[F 2/2/61] No. 9.Memorandum by Mr. Roberts. I. Territorial Position in the Pacific Ocean.(a) United States.THE insular possessions of the United States of America in the Pacific Ocean are : The Philippine Islands, the Hawaiian (or Sandwich) Islands, Guam Island, Wake Island, .Aiuerican Samoa (or Navigator Islands), and some isolated islands in the Central Polynesian Sporades. Of these, the only possessions not subject to the restriction on the development of fortifications and naval bases imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty of the 6th February, 1922, are the Hawaiian Islands.(i) The Philippines belong, not so much to Oceania, as to the continent of Asia. They are a link in the chain of partly submerged mountains which, starting from the peninsula of Kamchatka, runs parallel to the mainland of Asia as far as Singapore, and includes Japan, Formosa and Borneo. They are separated from British North Borneo by a narrow strait, and are distant some 250 miles from Formosa, 400 miles from the mainland of China, 1,000 miles from Singapore and 1,300 miles from Nagasaki.(ii) The interest of Guam lies in its position in the archipelago of islands under Japanese mandate, consisting of the Ladrones (or Marianne) Islands, the Caroline Islands and the Marshall Islands. The naval base and its defences are alike on a modest scale. It is relatively near the Philippines, being nearly four times as far from Honolulu as it is from the former islands. If the United States were to withdraw from the Philippines, and retain no naval bases there, Guam would remain as the spear-point of the United States penetration into the Japanese sphere of influence.(iii) Wake Island lies between Guam and Honolulu, being slightly nearer the former.   It has not, so far as is known, yet been developed to any extent.(iv) The capital and chief port of the Hawaiian Islands is Honolulu. It is approximately 3,500 miles from Yokohama, 4,500 miles from the Philippines, 2,000 miles from San Francisco and 5,000 miles from Panama. Pearl Harbour is capable of being transformed into a first-class naval base, and it is reported that 8,655,352 dollars have recently been allocated for the purpose.(v) American Samoa lies so far to the south that the group, which contains the secondary naval base of Pago Pago, may perhaps be left out of account for present purposes.(vi) The same may be said of various islands in the Central Polynesian Sporades.(B) Japan.The insular possessions of Japan in the Pacific Ocean (other than the islands composing Japan proper) may be grouped as follows : (i) Islands ivhere the maintenance of the status quo in respect of fortifications-tions and naval bases is imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty .-- -The Kurile Islands. The Bonin Islands.Amami-Oshima and the Loochoo Islands. Formosa and the Pescadores.(ii) Islands held tinder mandate, and therefore likewise incapable of beingfortified, so long as the obligations of the mandate subsist:  The Ladrones (or Marianne) Islands. The Caroline Islands. The Marshall Islands.7175   [994 o-2] b9722
(iii) Islands which Japan is at liberty to fortify .- Marcus Island (about 1,000 miles south-east of Yokohama). The harbour has apparently not been developed as yet, but would probably be capable of transformation into a naval base.II. Major United States Possessions. (i) Hawaii.The annual report of the Governor of Hawaii for 1932 gives the population as 380,507, of whom 146,189, or 38-4 per cent., are of Japanese race. This is a decrease in percentage of 4 per cent, over 1920, but an increase in numbers of some 35,000. The islands, which formerly constituted an independent kingdom, were annexed to the United States in 1898. They enjoy a considerable measure of self-government, with a bi-cameral legislature, and fears are entertained in some quarters that the Japanese element may before long be able to dominate the Legislature. It is also felt that, in the event of war between Japan and the United States, it might not be possible to count on the loyalty of the Japanese element. As the importance of Hawaii to the United States is primarily strategical, the naval point of view is apt to favour restriction of local liberties and the introduction of stricter control by the United States. It is therefore significant that a Bill now before Congress would abolish the requirement that the Governor of Hawaii must be a local resident.Economically, Hawaii is completely dominated by the United States. In 1931, out of total imports valued at 87 million dollars, the United States supplied 79 million dollars, whilst the United States took 102 million dollars out of a total of 103 million dollars of exports. The next best customer of Hawaii is Japan, with a total trade for 1931 of 3 million dollars. The principal occupation is the cultivation of sugar and pineapples.(ii) The Philippines.The population is estimated at 13 millions, of whom 27,000 are Japanese, including a compact settlement numbering some 15,000 on the Gulf of Davao in the island of Mindanao. The islands were ceded by Spain to the United States in 1898, after the Spanish-American War. Like Hawaii, they are to a considerable extent self-governing, with a bi-cameral legislature and an American Governor-General, supported by a cadre of United States officials. The agitation for independence dates from 1916, and led to the passage in 1932 by the United States Congress of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Independence Act, despite the veto of Mr. Hoover. This Act provided for the formulation by the Filipinos of a Constitution, and, after acceptance of the latter by the President of the United States, for the independence of the islands, subject to a transitional period of ten years, during which a United States High Commissioner would exercise rights of supervision. During the same period the entry of Filipinos into the United States would be restricted to a quota of fifty a year with total exclusion at the end of the period, while Philippine exports would continue to be admitted to the United States market on the present practically free-trade basis, except that sugar exported to the United States in excess of 850,000 long tons annually would pay the full tariff, as would cocoanut oil in excess of 200,000 long tons, and manila products in excess of 3 million lb. (The present annual output of sugar is estimated at 1,100,000 tons, while exports of cocoanut oil to the United States in 1932 were 110,259 tons, and of manila products about 4,500,000 lb.) In addition, an export duty, the proceeds of which were to be devoted to the service and redemption of&quot; the Philippine debt, would be payable on all articles admitted duty-free into the United States, beginning in the sixth year of independence with a rate of 5 per cent, of the United States import tariff and rising to 25 per cent, of that tariff in the tenth year. After the expiry of the transitional period, Philippine imports into the United States would receive the same treat-ment as those of any other foreign country. The offer contained in the Act was rejected by the Philippine Senate, and the next word presumably lies with the United States Congress, when it reassembles in January 1934.In 1931 Philippine imports were worth 99 million dollars (including imports from the United States at 62 million dollars and from Japan at 10-5 million dollars), while the value of exports was 104 million dollars (including exports to
the United States at 83 million dollars and to Japan at 3-5 million dollars). These figures are, it will be noted, of the same order as those for Hawaii, the population of which is one-thirty-eighth of that of the Philippines. The principal exports are sugar, coconut oil, copra, manila products and tobacco, whilst imports consist of various manufactured goods, especially cotton textiles. As in many other markets, the thrust of Japanese competition is increasing, and is particularly effective in cotton and silk textiles. Of 1,407 million dollars capital invested in the Philippines (estimate of January 1932), 882 dollars were Filipino capital, 258 dollars United States capital, 26 million dollars Chinese and only 3^ million dollars Japanese capital. As a result of the increase in the standard of living due to United States tutelage and to their privileged position in the United States market the cost of production in the Philippines is greatly in excess of that in competing countries, e.g., in Java wages are only half those in the Philippines, whilst the yield of cane is more than double. Consequently, it is estimated that in the seventh year from the inception of independence under the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act Philippine sugar would be undersold by Cuban sugar (assuming present relative production costs to remain unchanged). From the economic point of view political independence could scarcely fail to spell ruin for the Philippines, whilst on the other hand their political future would be full of danger, both from within and from without.The Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act provided for the retention, after indepen-dence, of the right of the United States &quot; to maintain military and other reservations and aianed forces in the Philippines,&quot; while the President of the United States was &apos;&apos; at the earliest practicable date, to enter into negotiations with foreign Powers with a view to the conclusion of a treaty for the perpetual neutralisation of the Philippine Islands.&quot; These mutually incompatible and ill-digested provisions were naturally amongst those which called forth the most searching criticism from Mr. Hoover and his advisers. In a letter to Senator Bingham, the Secretary of State wrote, on the 15th February, 1932, that the result of independence on these terms would be &apos;&apos; economic chaos and political and social anarchy .... followed ultimately by domination of the Philippines by some foreign Power, probably either China or Japan.&quot; On the 15th January, 1933. Mr. Stimson wrote, in response to a request by the President for his views on the Bill, a letter in which the following passage occurs : &apos;&apos; Withdrawal of our sovereignty from the Philippines and the termination of our responsibility in and for the islands . . . would tend profoundly to disturb [the] political equilibrium throughout the area of the Western Pacific and Eastern Asia.&quot; In his message returning the Bill to Congress without his approval the President wrote : &apos;&apos; The Philippines include, in terms of comparison with their neighbouring oriental countries, large areas of undeveloped resources. The pressures of those immense neighbour populations for peaceful infiltration or forceable [sic&apos;] entry into this area are most potent. Many of these races are more devoted to commercial activities than the population of the islands and the infiltration is constant and fraught with friction. Nor has the spirit of imperialism and the exploitation of peoples by other races departed from the earth . . . The Bill makes no effective provision for the maintenance of their [the Philippines&apos;] independence there-after from outside pressure, except a promise of effort on our part toward neutralisation. We have the option to continue maintenance of military and naval bases. Other nations are unlikely to become parties to neutralisation if we continue such bases and neutralisation is a feeble assurance of independence in any event unless we guarantee it.&quot;The present United States naval bases in the Philippines are Kavite (near Manila) and Olompago (Subic Bay, also near Manila), which latter undertakes all repairs of the Asiatic Fleet. Speaking before the House Committee on Insular Affairs on the 10th February, 1932, the Secretary of War stated that, in the event of war, the Philippines, which did not maintain any force capable of offering effective resistance to an invading army, and which the United States were by treaty precluded from fortifying, would easily succumb to attack. In a despatch dated the 6th April, 1932, Sir R. Lindsay wrote of &quot; a quite widespread fear that retention of responsibility for the islands must lead to a war with Japan, in which the American navy will be wiped out.&quot; A little earlier, on the 18th February, he had reported general recognition in the United States press &quot; that the islands, if granted independence, would be unable to defend themselves against attack by Japan,&quot; adding that &quot; doubts are expressed asf 994 o-2] b 2
to the ability, and even as to the willingness, of the United States to defend them in the event of such aggression. While there is a strong feeling that the United States would be well rid of its liability in respect of the islands, the opinion is prevalent that it would be indecent, if not degrading, to withdraw at the present time.&quot; If, however, such withdrawal were to take place, it should, as at least one paper suggested, be &quot; without reservations and conditions.&quot; On the other hand, the Secretary of State, in his letter to the President quoted above, referred to the possibility, as more in harmony with the traditions of United States policy towards the Philippines, &quot;of some future connexion between the United States and the Philippines, such as, for example, that which has ... . . been realised between the free nations which compose the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; This proposition was characterised by General Wood, the most successful of Governors-General of the Philippines, as highly dangerous, in view of the difference in race, traditions and characteristics between the Filipinos and the people of the United States, but such a relationship has nevertheless been seriously contemplated by those Filipinos whose ardent nationalism is* tempered by a realisation of the almost complete economic dependence of the islands on the United States. Quite recently, however, there has been no little talk in Filipino circles, including such a prominent fighter for independence as the President of the Senate, in favour of applying for admission to the British Commonwealth, if possible, with dominion status, in the event of severance of the link with the United States.The immigration regulations which exclude Japanese from the United States are not applicable in the Philippines, and apprehension of Japanese designs is a comparatively recent growth. In 1896, during the first phase of the struggle against Spain, the Filipino rebel leaders actually petitioned the Japanese Government to annex the islands. But when, in September 1931, the Manchurian crisis arose, the Philippine press was quick to draw an, analogy between Manchuria and the Philippines and to suggest that at some future date Japan might intervene forcibly on behalf of her nationals in the islands in the same manner. The Japanese are firmly established in the local fishing industry, and Filipinos look even more askance on the prosperous settlement on the Gulf of Davao, mentioned above, which, by scientific methods, raises the best quality of hemp grown in the islands. Japanese spokesmen have on several occasions protested against the imputation to Japan of intentions of annexing the Philippines, and declared that the development of trade with the islands was her only interest in that quarter. No doubt she would be quick to protest against any oppression of her nationals or any immigration restrictions of a discriminatory nature, and, if United States control is one day withdrawn, neither of these eventualities is very unlikely; but it remains to be shown that she harbours serious designs upon the Philippines as a suitable outlet for her surplus population, and that she would be likely to resort to high-handed measures unless challenged by a policy so overtly hostile that she could not ignore it, in fact, unless the conditions characterising China and Manchuria are repeated in the islands.III. Attitude of United States Opinion towards Japanese Policy in Manchuriaand in the Pacific.The official attitude of the United States towards the policy which has culminated in the creation of Manchukuo must presumably be sought in the Hoover-Stimson doctrine of non-recognition of settlements achieved by force. Public opinion, as reflected in the press, has been overwhelmingly against entangle-ment in the dispute, which is envisaged as a matter of predominantly Asiatic concern, and it has preferred to place its trust in the long-run effect on Japan of the pressure of international disapproval. When the decision of the Committee of Ninteen was reported, there was great satisfaction that the League of Nations had accepted the &quot;American policy&quot; in the Far East, and Would refuse to recognise Manchukuo. At the same time, however, United States public opinion continued to fear that an invocation of article 16 of the Covenant would lead to another world war, while noting with satisfaction that the United States&apos; is party to no treaty which provides for sanctions as an alternative to negotiations. When Great Britain declared an embargo on the export of arms to China and Japan the
United States press announced with unusual unanimity that on no account ought the United States to follow the British example, although, inconsistently enough, Mr. Hoover&apos;s Message to Congress, asking for power to impose an embargo if a similar step were taken by other exporting countries, had previously been given a. favourable reception in principle.The above indications of the attitude of United States opinion towards developments on the continent of Asia cannot, however, obviously be applied without reservation to Japanese policies in the Pacific. The general reaction to the Japanese threat to retain the mandated Pacific islands appeared to be that Japan could not be restrained from this course, but the question has not been sufficiently aired for any reliable conclusion to be drawn. The degree of danger from Japan to the Philippines in the event of the grant of independence to the latter must largely depend on the terms of that independence, and cannot therefore be profitably estimated at present. There remains the question of the probable attitude of the United .States in the event of Japanese aggression against the Philippines (or, less probably, other United States possessions in the Pacific), assuming the maintenance of the present status quo in the islands. It may be permitted to suggest that the risk of such an eventuality is slight unless Japan could feel sure of the benevolent neutrality of the British Empire, whilst, on the other hand, the United States, in view of the weakness and nakedness of its position in the Western Pacific, would probably, in the event of such a danger appearing imminent, endeavour to secure the support of the British Empire against Japanese designs. Whether, however, the United States would, in its turn, be prepared to throw its weight actively into the scale against Japanese aggression on British or Dutch possessions in the Pacific is probably quite another matter.P.

(14321)[F 7761/3110/10] No. 10.The Industrial and Economic Position in China.(1) The Industrialisation of China.ALREADY at the end of the 19th century various attempts had been made, with but doubtful success, to establish in China factories organised on Western lines. But it was not until the period of the Great War, when the finished products of the West for a time almost vanished from the markets of the Far East, that any serious development in the industrialisation of China took place. A favourable exchange abroad, and a vast unsatisfied demand at home, facilitated the equipment and ensured the prospects of China&apos;s new industries. Between 1913-19 her annual imports of machinery were more than trebled, and by 1921 there were established in the country some 2,100 power-driven factories.For almost half a century cotton piece-goods, mostly of British manufacture, had been the principal item of importation into China, and it was perhaps natural, therefore, that the most spectacular development of industrialisation should have taken place in the local textile trade. Up to 1914 there were only some thirty-two cotton mills in China (of which eight were Japanese and three British-owned), with a bare million spindles, and most of the locally grown raw cotton was exported abroad principally to Japan. But with the war there came a marked diminution in the volume of piece-goods imported from Europe, and although Japan was able in some degree to make up the deficiency, only some 18 million pieces entered China in 1918 as against 30 million in 1913. Prices soared to nearly treble their pre-war level, and under the stimulus of this sudden boom the newly established native textile industry grew apace. By the end of 1921 some eighty mills (of which about a third were Japanese), with 14,000 looms and over 2 million spindles, were in operation in China; the vastly increased local supply of raw cotton was being almost entirely absorbed internally, and it was even becoming necessary to import additional supplies of this commodity in ever increasing quantities from abroad.In the years following the war European textile industries, and notably the British, continued to regain some share of the trade in China which they had formerly enjoyed. But the imports of piece-goods never again reached the level of pre-war years, and as the Chinese textile industry, aided by low wages, the collapse of silver and anti-foreign boycotts, steadily developed, so the imports of piece-goods from abroad declined both in volume and relative importance (see Tables H and I). In the absence of any statistics relating to the internal trade of the country, it is impossible to estimate the turnover of the Chinese textile industry, but an idea of its development may be inferred from the fact that at the end&apos;of 1928 some 15,000 looms, with a total of 3,600,000 spindles, were at work in China, and that, while the volume of China&apos;s trade was constantly expanding, imports of foreign piece-goods had declined to the level of the war years (Table I).Only second in importance to the development of the textile industry in the years following the war was that of the native cigarette industry. The exotic fashion of cigarette smoking became general in China in the early years of this century, and the volume of foreign cigarette imports amounted steadily until 1923. Concurrently with this development, however, a number of factories for the manufacture of cigarettes by cheap native labour were set up in China itself, and this new industry, in which foreign capital was largely interested, underwent a rapid development. Boycotts and the fall of silver aided this industry as they aided the production of native textiles, and from 1924 the imports of foreign cigarettes declined as those of tobacco leaf mounted (table G). By 1928, locally produced cigarettes were dominating the native market, and it will later be seen that in the following years they secured a virtual monopoly of it.The growth of Chinese industry described above had in the main been due to individual initiative and the play of economic forces, but in the last five years 7164   [990 s-1] b9722

(2) The Economic Position in China with Special Reference to the Decline in exports.For more than fifty years the foreign trade of China has been afflicted with an excess of visible imports over visible exports. This excess, while fluctuating widely, has on the whole (as will be seen from Table A) tended steadily to increase in terms of silver, and in the last few years it has grown at a speed which would probably have been disastrous to any country with an economic system more complex than that of China.this natural process has been stimulated by official intervention. The Nationalist Government, pledged by the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen to a policy of industrialisation and fired by the example of the Soviet Five-Year Plan, has from its inception adopted a policy of fostering the development of Chinese industries, with the object of eventually rendering China independent of all foreign imports save raw material. Since 1928, when tariff autonomy was regained, there was until recently observable a steady tendency in successive tariffs to increase the duties on manufactured goods (particularly textiles), while those affecting factory equipment and raw materials were left practically unchanged; substantial and often unjustifiable privileges have been frequently accorded to the new industries in the shape of preferential freight rates and exemption from local taxation; in 1931 a National Economic Council for the supervision of the development of communications and rural reconstruction was set up; while, more recently, the Ministry of.Industry has formulated an ambitious four-year plan of industrial development for the Lower Yangtze valley. The plan provides for the establish-ment in the Nanking-Shanghai area of an iron and steel works, an ammonia sulphate plant and a machine tool factory&apos;. Lack of funds and political disorganisation has retarded progress in the realisation of this scheme, but the project, however embryonic, represents a serious attempt to evolve a &quot; planned economy &quot; for China.These measures of governmental encouragement were assisted in 1929-31 by a further heavy fall in the value of silver, and by a serious decline in the purchasing power of the country at large, due to civil disturbances and a dwindling export trade (see separate memorandum on decline in China&apos;s exports). By 1931 there were some 130 cotton mills, with more than 4 million spindles, operating in China; imports of raw cotton had risen from 2-5 million piculs in 1929 to 4-6 in 1931 (Table G), while those of foreign manufactured piece-goods had in the same period fallen from 26 million pieces to 12 million (Table I). Henceforward, Chinese manufactured piece-goods dominated the Chinese market in all but the quality lines, and although the troubles of 1932 and the prevailing economic depression have seriously affected the native cotton industry, it seems clear that the time is not far distant when the volume and value of foreign cotton textiles imported into China will have become insignificant.While the principal developments in the industrialisation of China has of recent years taken place in the cotton textile trades, the native cigarette industry has undergone a similar, but more modest, growth. Considerable expansion has also occurred in the manufacture of leather and rubber goods, and throughout the country there is a tendency for the products of foreign light industries to be displaced by those of local manufacture. This process is gradually changing the nature of foreign imports into China, and is conceding to raw materials and machinery the importance once enjoyed by finished goods; and though there is a distinct possibility of China&apos;s industrial growth being stunted in the near future by the imposition of heavy duties on machinery and raw metals, there seems little doubt that as the industrial revolution progresses, the United Kingdom&apos;s import trade into China will become more and more a monopoly of our heavy industries. It should be remembered, however, that while at the moment the United Kingdom dominates the machinery market in China, Japan has lately appeared as a competitor there, and that the low wages of her workers, coupled with her propinquity to China, will in all probability cause her before long to become as serious a rival in the production of, for instance, textile machinery as she already is in that of textiles themselves.S. HARCOURT-SMITH.Foreign Office, December 10, 1933.
3To understand the reasons why China, a country possessed of almost every natural resource, and for centuries self-sufficient, should now absorb far more products of foreign countries than she can sell to them, it is necessary briefly to examine the nature of her foreign trade from the time, some 200 years ago, when intercourse with the West was first developed on any considerable scale. Then, and for some seventy years following, the balance of her external trade was overwhelmingly in favour of China. She exported to Europe (and later to America) vast quantities of silk goods, porcelain and tea, and took very little in return. Towards the end of the 18th century, however, a profitable import trade in opium was developed, and its rapid growth, coupled with a decline in the export of porcelain due to its extensive manufacture in Europe, resulted by the I end of the first quarter of the 19th century in an equilibrium of imports and exports. In the next two decades foreign trade was extended by treaty far beyond the confines of Canton, and the Chinese consumer gradually developed a taste not only for the products of Indian poppy fields, but also for those of Lancashire looms. By the eighties increased sales of foreign piece-goods in China, unaccompanied by any proportionate growth in the foreign demand for tea and silk had inflicted upon China an average annual unfavourable trade balance of about 15 million taels. The next thirty years the era of railway construction and the golden age of the extra-territorial system saw a vast extension of foreign trade. Imports of foreign textiles rose by some 600 per cent., foreign cigarettes and kerosene became staple commodities of Chinese life, and railway construction brought about the birth of an import trade in machinery and metals which was later to attain great importance (Table G). Unfortunately this growth in imports was unaccompanied by any commensurate expansion in exports. It is true that there was a large increase in the sale abroad of Chinese wool, vegetable oils and furs; that Japan began to buy from China most of the iron ore and pig iron needed for her new industries, and that there was developed  largely by Japanese and British enterprise respectively a considerable export trade in bean and egg products (Table J). On the other hand, Japan, by modern methods and superior organisation, ejected China from her predominating place, in the rapidly-growing American silk market, while the competition of the Indian plantation struck a heavy blow at the tea trade of Fukien.During the Great War the growth of the import trade was seriously retarded, while a shortage of food-stuffs in Europe gave a certain stimulus to the export trade. As a result an equilibrium, in China&apos;s foreign dealings was for a brief period almost established, but by 1922 (see Table A) imports were again out-distancing exports and the gap between them has tended steadily to increase until the present time.It will be noticed (Table A) that the silver value of imports mounted steadily until the year 1932, while that of exports first began to fall off in 1930. While it is true that this expansion of China&apos;s foreign commerce was in some measure due to a heavy fall in the world value of silver, it may be as well, before discussing the disastrous shrinkage of her trade in the last few years, to examine more closely the reasons for its comparative vitality in the last decade- a vitality unimpaired by an increasing excess of visible imports over exports, and by all the evils of prolonged civil chaos.The years 1920-30 saw the completion of the change in the nature of China&apos;s exports, which had been foreshadowed in the pre-war period. The imposition within the British Empire of preferential duties in favour of Indian tea, and the disruption of Fukien Province by civil war, almost brought to an end the export tea trade, which in the eighties had accounted for nearly half China&apos;s total exports (Table K). Raw silk and silk products, while faring slightly better, declined in relative importance, if not in volume, while the iron market was affected by a tendency of Japan to turn to Malaya and India for supplies. It was in the new categories of exportable products that the main increase took place. Exports of soya beans and beancake, egg products, vegetable oils and cotton textiles the first-fruits of Chinese industrialisation (see Memorandum on Industrialisation) all showed large increases; by 1930 sales of these commodities abroad accounted for more than 40 per cent, of China&apos;s total export trade.The nature of the import trade also tended to change during this period. Due to the fall in silver and the increasing competition of native products (see Memorandum on Industrialisation), imports of cotton goods, cotton yarn and cigarettes declined in volume, value and relative importance, while the increasing[990 s-1] &apos;   b 2
use of electricity brought about a serious diminution in imports of kerosene. Raw materials (cotton, tobacco, metals, &amp;c.) and machinery, on the other hand, showed large increases, while a disquietening feature, reflecting the gradual decay, through civil confusion and excessive taxation of China&apos;s rural economy, was the large purchases of food-stuffs from abroad (rice, wheat, flour, sugar, &amp;c), which in 1930 accounted for some 20 per cent, of total imports.From the above brief survey it will be seen that throughout the last decade China, although distracted by civil wars, and with her principal industry  agriculture in decline, was able continuously to import, without detriment to her economic position, vastly more merchandise from abroad than she exported thither. The discrepancy (which outgoings on foreign loans and business establishments tend to increase) was not adjusted by exports of bullion from the country (on the contrary, bullion movements were largely controlled by the price of silver, and during the period under review the flow tended towards rather than away from China), and other explanations of the mystery must be sought. The problem has recently formed the subject of a thorough investigation by an American economist,(&apos;) who has reached the following very plausible conclusions : (1) Remittances to China from overseas Chinese in Malaya, United States, the South Seas, &amp;c, averaged about 200 million Mexican dollars annually, and increased in 1930 to about 300 million Mexican dollars.(2) There is reason to believe that exports from China, as compared with imports, have been undervalued by the Customs in the last ten years from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent.(3) The expenditure of foreigners in China (garrisons, warships, missions, philanthropic institutions, business people, tourists, &amp;c.) totalled about 180 million Mexican dollars in 1929 and 170 million Mexican dollars in 1930.(2)Having made allowance for all these items, Mr. Remer is, however, still confronted with what he calls an &quot; unexplained balance,&quot; which until 1929-30 was of inconsiderable dimensions; and there would in fact appear to be good grounds for believing that until 1930 some form of rough equilibrium between China&apos;s in-and-out payments had been established, and that, despite the ravages of civil war, the confusion of her national finances and the ineptitude of her Governments, her economic position was far sounder than the attached statistics would suggest.China has but recently been drawn into the orbit of international trade, and her economy would appear to be still insensitive to all but the major5 vicissitudes of world markets. For this reason she remained comparatively unaffected by the minor industrial depression which began in Europe in 1926. It is true that in terms of gold her foreign trade showed a certain decline, but this diminution was due largely to the fact that her purchasing power in silver failed to increase as fast as the value of silver itself fell. By 1931, however, the severe depression precipitated by the collapse of the New York stock market in 1929 had become too general for China to be able to escape its effects. The market price of China&apos;s staple exports (and particularly of soya beans) fell rapidly, without stimulating any compensatory demand. In the United States and Germany heavy duties were imposed upon egg products, while similar measures were adopted in the United Kingdom in the following year. The export of seed products, the oil extracted from which is largely used in the manufacture of paints, was seriously affected by the world-wide depression in the building trades; and sales of wood oil to America, where the greater part of China&apos;s production was usually aborbed, diminished owing to the competition of a locally extracted oil. Nor did events in China tend to counteract these external influences. A disastrous flood in the Middle Yangtze basin threw out of production one of the most fertile agricultural areas in China, and necessitated the importation of food-stuffs (principally American wheat) in large quantities, while the general dislocation of agriculture provoked by this disaster, and by the steadily increasing civil and financial disorder, caused the Chinese cotton crop to be less adequate than ever for the ^rowing needs of the Chinese textile industry, which were met in part by the importation of raw cotton (chiefly from India) on a scale hitherto unknown. Although there was a slight increase compared with 1930 in the silver value of(&apos;) C. F. Remer (Foreign Investments in China). (2) 1 Mexican dollar ss 0-G6 tael.
China&apos;s visible exports, in terms of gold they suffered a decline of nearly 25 per cent., while the excess of imports over exports increased by 110 million Haikwan taels.In the following year the decay in trade, already marked, was accentuated by the events of the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute. Hostilities at Shanghai dislocated the commerce of the Yangtze valley, paralysed communications and ruined a number of the native textiles mills. A stringent boycott reduced Japanese imports by 50 per cent., while, owing to Japanese retaliation, China&apos;s exports to her most profitable market declined by 180 million Haikwan taels. In Manchuria military operations and the uncertainties of the political situation early in the year brought trade to a standstill, while in March the declaration of the independence of Manchukuo severed from China a territory which in normal years produced nearly 40 per cent, of China&apos;s total exports, and which was the only area in the twenty-one provinces which usually enjoyed a favourable trade balance. Abroad, the competition of &quot;rayon&quot; was severely felt by Chinese exporters of silk, while the fall in the world price of butter and the consequent diminution in sales of margarine had an unfortunate repercussion upon the bean and ground-nut industries.In these circumstances it is perhaps hardly remarkable that in the year 1932 a severe shrinkage took place in the volume and value of both imports and exports. More serious still, however, is the rapid decline which has continued during the current year (Table A), and which may portend an economic crisis of the first magnitude. There is reason to believe that the depression in other countries, and particularly in the tin and rubber industries, has largely dried up the flow of remittances from overseas Chinese, which did so much in normal times to balance in-payments with out-payments; while the breakdown of internal communication, the burden of local taxation and the loss of markets abroad is tending progres-sively to reduce the purchasing power of the unfortunate agriculturalist the largest class of Chinese consumer. For centuries her rural economy has been the background of China&apos;s trade; now, under the double strain of maladministration and trade depression, this Venerable system, with its complex social and commercial organisation, appears to be breaking up. A planned economy under governmental control has been designed gradually to supersede it. This may in itself tend to simplify the actual working of foreign trade, and facilitate the granting of credits necessary for its expansion; unless, however, China once more displays an unexpected degree of economic vitality, it will require a Government of boundless authority and limitless perseverance at best to stimulate anew the external commerce of the country and at worst to arrest the decay to which these last three years bear melancholy witness.S.

[F 107/107/10] No. 11.Memorandum respecting the British and Japanese Interests in China and the Prospects of a Sino-Japanese Rapprochement.IN the last 200 years four Great Powers Russia, Great Britain, Japan and the United States of America have been of predominant importance in the commercial and consequently in the political relations of China with the outside world. Russia was the first of them to disturb Chinese isolation; by a policy of advance so consistent as to link Karakhan historically with Peter the Great, the Russian frontier was within our own times brought to march with that of China right across the length of Asia; Russian interests in Sinkiang, Mongolia and Manchuria acquired a special position, and twice in the present century in 1905 and again in 1926 Russia came near to establishing in China itself a predominating influence. The Communist failure in 1927, however (see memorandum on Russia in the Far East), the gradual defection of Outer Mongolia from the Chinese polity, and the establishment in Manchuria of a nominally independent State, appear, momentarily at any rate, to have defeated the policy of two centuries, and to have put Russian influence in China proper under an eclipse, which the insignificance of her commercial interests there can do little to dissipate.American contacts with China both political and commercial first became considerable in the last half of the 19th century. At first the attitude of the United States towards China tended to resemble that adopted by His Majesy&apos;s Government; of recent times, however-, it has been largely determined by the principles of the open door policy, by suspicion of Japan, and by the vague sentimental feeling of the American people for the &quot; Sister Republic across the Ocean.&quot; Culturally, American influence, largely disseminated by missionaries, teachers and returned students, is enormous, while of recent years America has secured first place in China&apos;s import trade. It is doubtful, however, to what degree this commercial predominance is genuine, since much of the raw cotton and wheat flour which have lately formed so large a proportion of American imports to China has been in the nature of loans in kind to the Chinese Government, the volume of which has been governed less by the needs of China than by the plight of American agriculture. Apart from the value of this import trade and of her cultural influence, America&apos;s stake in China is comparatively small. Her total investments there are estimated to amount to not more than  40 million (gold) about one-sixth of the British total; her shipping plays a comparatively insignificant part in the China trade; and, apart from the extra-territorial rights enjoyed by her citizens, she has no special privileges or interests to defend in China. Consequently, the concern of American foreign policy with China tends to be of an intermittent and uncertain kind.There remain to be considered the two Great Powers England and Japan whose interests, both commercial and political, have for so long exercised a predominant influence upon the destinies of China. Great Britain was the virtual creator of China&apos;s modern trade with the outside world, and the chief architect of the extra-territorial system. Fifty years ago, more than one-quarter of China&apos;s total trade was with this country, and more than three-quarters with the British Empire as a whole. Since then, our share in this commerce, while increasing in value and volume, has, partly owing to the competition of Japanese and later-Chinese textile products, steadily declined in comparative importance, so that to-day Great Britain enjoys little more than one-ninth, and the British Empire a bare one-third, of the world&apos;s total trade with China. We are still, however, the largest supplier of manufactui&quot;ed goods: the volume of our imports to China in these recent lean years has displayed a vitality unequalled by any other country, our shipping predominates both in the ports and on the rivers of China, and British investments recently estimated at 7203   [5 b 1] ,t9722CONFIDENTIAL. (14339)
about  237 million (gold) represent by far the largest item in the total of foreign capital holdings in China.(&apos;)The importance of the Chinese market to us China absorbing some, 2-5 per cent, of our total exports ranks sixteenth on the list of this country&apos;s customers, while our investments there represent a bare 5 per cent, of our total foreign holding is, nevertheless, out of all proportion to the actual cash value of our dealings with the country; rather does it lie in a vague expectation of a future commerce on an astronomical scale, a dream to which the West has remained faithful ever since the days of Marco Polo and his millions. In actual fact, we have in China a country containing roughly one-fifth of the world&apos;s total population, and enjoying, despite more than a century of attempted exploitation by the West, but 2 per cent, of the world&apos;s trade. The external per capita purchases of China, even in times of prosperity, are not more than half those of India, one-tenth those of Japan, and but 4 per cent, of those of the average industrialised Western country. What, then, are the prospects of an expansion of Chinese foreign trade to a volume commensurate with the long-cherished expectations of the West ? It has been assumed that about 60 per cent, of Chinese foreign commerce is confined to the treaty ports and to their immediate vicinity, inhabited by but a small proportion of the total population. That only so modest a proportion of foreign goods penetrates to the markets of the interior is due to the prohibitive cost of transport, which, in turn, is caused by lack of railways, bad roads, unregulated rivers and canals, and the prevalence of banditry, civil wars, &amp;c. Of recent years, there has been a considerable development of internal communications by road and air, but the other factors are still operative, and their removal must await a solution of the agrarian difficulties, which constitute China&apos;s gravest affliction at the present time (see memorandum on the Economic Position of China).(&quot;) When once, however, these obstacles have been overcome, goods should be enabled to reach the interior at cheaper prices and to satisfy a larger demand than has been known hitherto. This expansion of external trade will in all likelihood be a slow process; it will probably be accompanied by a gradual increase of foreign investments in China, At present the infiltration of money from abroad is checked by unfavourable political conditions, but part passu with the removal of this obstacle, foreign capital should tend to flow into China indirectly in the form of the supply of manufactured products principally equipment goods on credit, and directly by the financing of industrial and governmental projects, such as the construction of factories, bridges, &amp;c. In the meanwhile, it seems likely that, whatever happens, the growth of the world&apos;s trade with China (and with it that of British exports thither) will be steady rather than spectacular.Meanwhile the nature of such trade as remains to us is gradually changing. It seems evident that Lancashire can never again hope in China to do more than a modest business in textiles of fine quality, and that the British importing firms, who in the past have mainly handled piece-goods, will be well-advised  if not compelled increasingly to turn their attention towards the satisfaction of China&apos;s demands for heavy machinery. Though Lancashire may lose by the change, it seems probable that our commercial interests as a whole will gain strength from it, since by dealing in &quot; heavy &quot; goods which only Government organisations or large industrial undertakings can afford to purchase, they will be less exposed than heretofore to the dangers of boycott by the small Chinese consumer.The commercial considerations outlined above have of recent years played their part in determining the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in China; while adhering to the doctrine of the &quot; open door,&quot; we desire to see China attain a degree of political stability propitious to our commerce, and for various reasons which are again connected with our commercial interests, we have been prepared gradually to surrender our extra-territorial privileges, and to envisage the eventual assumption by the Chinese Government of control over our concessions at Tientsin and Canton, and over the International Settlement at Shanghai.As far as the purely political as distinct from the politico-economic  aspect of our interests is concerned, our position in Hong Kong must also of(&apos;) Of this,  45 million represents holdings in Government obligations and Chinese Govern-ment railways; some  12 million of this sum was in default the 1st January, 19-33 (Eemer, Foreign Investments in China; also China Year Booh, 1933).(-) See No. 10 (14321).
necessity be an important factor in governing our policy. Hong Kong, while still a great distributing centre for the Chinese market, has also a certain strategic value as an advanced naval base and as an outpost of our Malayan possessions. It is at the moment vulnerable to two forms of attack, i.e., an economic attack by a Chinese boycott such as that which it suffered in 1926; and a military attack. A military attack might be made by the Chinese from the land side, or by either Japan or the United States of America from the sea. Excluding the possibility, for the moment, at any rate, of a Chinese or an American onslaught upon Hong Kong, there remains the danger, in the event of an Anglo-Japanese war, of a descent by the Japanese fleet, which in the present undefended state of the colony would almost certainly be attended with success. However hypothetical this may be (and there is no reason for thinking that Japan would seek a contest with the British Empire), it is obvious that the existence of Hong Kong as a possession of value to us is dependent not only upon the goodwill of China, but also upon the preservation of harmonious relations with Japan.The rise of Japan to a position of supreme importance in the destinies, both political and economic, of China, has been far more recent and spectacular than ours. Forty years ago Japan was in the habit of purchasing from China for her new industries an inconsiderable quantity of raw materials, and of selling to her in return an even less considerable quantity of manufactured goods  principally cotton yarn. Her investments in China were insignificant; she owned no concessions or territories of any kind on Chinese soil; and of all the ships plying in Chinese waters, but 7 per cent, were Japanese.Her defeat of China, however, in 1895 and of Russia ten years later radically transformed her position. Her victories not only brought her important political gains, but also gave an immense stimulus to her industries. By the eve of the Great War, she had annexed Korea and Formosa, consolidated her special position in Manchuria in a form which remained unmodified until 1932, had established a number of concessions within the Wall, and with her cheap textiles had won from the United Kingdom supremacy in the Chinese market. Her investments in China amounted to some 13 per cent, of the total foreign capital placed there; one-quarter of all the tonnage of shipping in Chinese waters, and half the foreign population of China, were Japanese.Until 1914 Japanese policy in China had on the whole followed the classic traditions of Western imperialism; but the increasing preoccupation of Great Britain and Russia in the European war left Japan free to pursue an unrestrained campaign of political and economic aggression. While the value of her imports into China doubled between the years 1914-19, Japan at the same time, by a policy of military and financial pressure, endeavoured to reduce China to a state of virtual subjection; and if this policy received a check from the Washington Conference and the earthquake of 1923, the halt was but temporary.Though circumstances compelled Japan towards moderation in the first decade after the war, the divergence between her policy and that of the Western Powers led by Great Britain tended sensibly to increase. This divergence was provoked by differences both of circumstance and of psychology. On the one hand, this country emerged from the misfortunes of the war with a reluctance, born of causes both financial and moral, any longer to use force for the preservation-tion of comparatively unimportant interests in a remote and dwindling market: and convinced by the examples of Egypt and India that the-goodwill of China, so essential to British trade, could best be won by judicious concessions to nationalistic feeling, she adopted a policy which was crystallised in the memorandum of December 1926. On the other hand, Japan, enriched as a result of the European conflict and with a record of three very profitable wars behind her, saw no reason to spew out the Nietzschean philosophy which she had swallowed with such gusto thirty years before; rather did she tend, untroubled by the moral rights of adolescent nationalism, to view the Chinese question in terms of ruthless logic. Next to that of America, the Chinese (and Manchurian) market was most important to her; some  230 million (gold) 80 per cent, of her total foreign investments were placed there; her exports to China were growing, and the opportunities for further development seemed boundless; why should she then sacrifice to a nationalism, which she at once despised and feared, a position so vital and so promising, when its retention by force would, in view of China&apos;s helplessness and propinquity, be a comparatively easy and inexpensive affair?[5 b-1] B 2
, Thus it was that Japan, though compelled at Washington in 1922 to sacrifice her special interests in Shantung, did so with very bad grace, and in the following-years declined to follow His Majesty&apos;s Government into making more far-reaching concessions to Chinese national aspirations. Alone of the Great Powers she refrained from negotiating a tariff autonomy treaty in 1928, and made little secret of the fact that she was opposed to the surrender of extra-territoriality except in return for a valuable quid pro quo.The gradual undermining of her position in Manchuria by Chinese nationalism, which had become emboldened (in her view) largely as a result of the &quot;weak&quot; policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, tended to confirm Japan&apos;s growing conviction that her special interests in China demanded a special line of action; and the career of militaristic aggression upon which she embarked on the 18th September, 1931, marked the beginning of a definite rupture with the pacific ideas of the West which culminated in Japan&apos;s recent withdrawal from the League of Nations.In the spring of 1933 Japan was thus left in a dominant but isolated position in the Par East; with her Chinese trade rapidly declining as a result of boycotts and hostile tariffs, and with her mind obsessed, however unjustly, by a feeling of resentment against this country for our alleged anti-Japanese attitude at Geneva. In these circumstances she seems to have reached the conclusion, which apprehensions of Russia may have tended to confirm, that she must forthwith establish an impregnable position in China. The first stage was the destruction, by an advance on Peking, of the last vestiges of military resistance to her designs; and so thoroughly was this effected that by the end of May the Nanking Government, despairing at once of the League and China&apos;s own powers of defence, had entered into negotiations with Japan for a general settlement of all major questions outstanding between the two countries. These negotiations, begun at Peking, were continued at Shanghai in the late summer, and, as far as is known, are still in progress. They have provoked intense dissension within the ranks of the Nanking Government itself, owing to the opposition of Dr. T. V. Soong and Dr. Lo Wen-kon to a policy of virtual surrender to Japan, but the resignation of these two Ministers has now been forced, and thus two of the principal obstacles in the way of a Sino-Japanese rapprochement have, for the moment at any rate, been removed.The exact nature of the terms upon which a Sino-Japanese settlement is in contemplation are unknown; Dr. T. V. Soong recently informed Sir M. Lampson that Japan had actually offered to restore some measure of Chinese sovereignty over Manchuria in return for an economic and military alliance which was to result in the virtual exclusion from China of all other foreign interests. All the information, however, in the possession of this Department would suggest that the Japanese have from the first refused even to consider the possibility of any modification favourable to Chinese amour-propre in the status of Manchukuo, and it seems therefore advisable not to accept Dr. Soong&apos;s statement without reserve. At the same time there is reason to believe that some form of agreement is contemplated whereby, in return for a measure of financial assistance, the retrocession of certain of the less important Japanese concessions, and the modification of Japanese extra-territorial privileges, Japan would secure in China various political and economic privileges which would tend to transform all the accessible regions of China into a Japanese preserve, and would seriously undermine our interests there. It is, of course, probable that determined popular opposition in China may frustrate these schemes. At the same time it should be remembered that the-restoration of Sino-Japanese relations to a state of harmony is as important to the economy of China as it is to that of Japan; that in North China Japanese influence has of late extended so rapidly that the whole area north of the Yellow River bids fair to become an adjunct of Manchukuo; and that the Nanking Government, in its present desperate mood, may find it hard to resist the double bait of financial assistance, coupled with a restoration of xi sovereign rights.&quot;The possibility, therefore, of a Sino-Japanese entente with results detrimental to British interests cannot entirely be discounted, and it may in consequence be as well to consider how best this danger could be averted. From the time of the Washington Conference until 1931, the growing force of Chinese nationalism was the most important and dangerous factor in the Far Eastern situation; and the cultivation of Chinese goodwill seemed to be the safest method
of preserving our interests and of ensuring for this country her fair share in the future expansion of the Chinese market. The events of the last two years, how-ever, have proved that Chinese nationalism, as at present constituted, is power-less to resist determined aggression from abroad; with its machinery disorganised and its spirit impaired, it has been compelled to relapse into a comparatively passive state, and Japanese militarism appears now to have usurped its place as the dominant force in the Far East. This setback may be, and probably is, but temporary; in the long run Chinese goodwill may prove to be as essential to our interests as it has ever been. The question is whether this goodwill would at the moment prove an adequate safeguard of our position, in the not entirely unlikely event of an attempt by Japan to transform China into an exclusively Japanese preserve.In such an attempt in which British interests by virtue of their pre-dominating importance would bear the brunt of the attack, Japan would only succeed with Chinese co-operation. By continuing our present policy of cultivating good relations with China and of conciliating her legitimate national aspirations, we may establish a moral claim upon her sympathies sufficient to prevent such co-operation taking place. The doubtful point is how far the Chinese would allow friendship or gratitude to stand in the way of their immediate interests. We are an unimportant customer of China (see appendix to Memorandum on the Economic Position in China(3)); and, from a military point of view, our capacity to harm her is as small as is our inclination to do so. Japan, on the other hand, is in normal times China&apos;s most valuable customer, and is a great and ever-present military danger. In these circumstances will China prefer the benefits of British friendship to the more concrete advantages of appeasing a superior customer and a menacing enemy ?The inherent contempt and dislike of the Chinese for the Japanese must not, of course, be underrated, and as has already been suggested, this fundamental sentiment may yet defeat Japan&apos;s more ambitious schemes in China. At the same time it seems clear that whatever happens, Japan is vitally interested in establishing a position of special importance for herself in China, and that in considering Far Eastern policy it is impossible to avoid this consideration. It is probable that only with foreign technical assistance and support can China arrest the decay which has recently overcome her political and economic structure. In the present circumstances such assistance can only come either from Japan or from the West. If it comes from Japan alone it will probably be given in a manner likely to benefit Japan rather than China. If it comes from the West without the acquiescence of the Japanese (as in the case of Dr. Rajchman&apos;s recent appointment), it runs the risk of being stultified by their hostility and suspicion. On the other hand, any measure of assistance offered to China by the West with the approval and collaboration of Japan would if so facto be endowed with a reasonable prospect of success; and the problem of the future is whether Japan can by any means be induced to enter into a scheme of inter-national co-operation in China which would reconcile her own peculiar and vital interests with those of the Chinese and the other countries concerned.S.

CONFIDENTIAL. (14346)[F 414/68/10] No. 12.Memorandum respecting Foreign Investments in China.A VERY valuable book by an American economist, Mr. C. F. Remer, has recently been published under the above title. Mr. Remer has carefully examined all previous estimates made, and has checked these in the light of his own enquiries and researches. He shows no sign of prejudice or national bias, but sets out the facts quite objectively. So far as one can judge, his results may be relied on as giving a true picture of the relative position held by each of the chief trading and investing countries in China. I have endeavoured in this memorandum to extract from his book and set out in brief tabular form figures showing the general position as regards foreign investments in China at the beginning of 1931. The results are very striking, and may be allowed to speak for themselves.2. The total foreign investment in China in January 1931 amounted to  666 million. Tables (a), (b) and (c) show how this sum was distributed (a) between the various creditor countries, (b) geographically, and (c) accordingto the nature of the investment: (a) Creditor countries  Million  .

In the above table the expression &quot; general purposes of the Chinese Govern-ment &apos;J means borrowings of the Chinese Government for purposes other than railways and communications.   -3. Foreign investments may also be classified as (a) direct business investments, and (b) indirect investments through the medium of Government borrowings (see table (d) below). In this case the investment is indirect because the obligation of the Chinese Government lies between the foreign investor and whatever risk is involved in the use of the funds. Direct business investments need not necessarily be in private hands. The Chinese Eastern Railway and the Yunnan Railway are examples of direct investments held by foreign Governments.(d)  .

The figures in the above tables refer to the period at the beginning of 1931. They indicate the very great importance of direct business investments in China and the commanding position held by Great Britain and Japan (38 per cent, and 36 per cent., respectively) in this field (see table (e)). They also indicate the overwhelming importance of Shanghai. Since these figures were compiled, however, Manchuria has been severed from China, and is now to all intents and purposes a separate country. If an attempt were made to investigate the present position as regards investment in China, only figures relating to China proper would fall to be considered. If the figures relating to Manchuria are excluded from Mr. Reiner&apos;s tables, it is possible to form an approximate estimate of the present position. Thus, the total foreign investment in China would be reduced from  666 million to about  485 million, distributed geographically as follows : (m)  Million  . Per cent, of Total.Shanghai ... ... 228-3             47-0Rest of China ... ... 124-8             26-0Undistributed ... ... 132-2             27-0485-3 1000Thus, the foreign investment in Shanghai to-day is probably nearly double the foreign investment in the whole of the rest of China. The Japanese business investment in Manchuria in 1931 is estimated by Mr. Remer at  113 million, and the Russian investment at  54-7 million. If these sums are excluded, the total business investment in China is reduced from  520 million to about  352 million, distributed as follows :  	Million  .	Per cent, of Total.Great Britain	197-9	56-2Japan	74-0	210Russia	1-3	0-united States of America ...	31-9	90France	19-5	5-5Germany	15-4	4-4Belgium ...	8-5	2-5Netherlands	20	0-6Italy	0-9	0-3Scandinavia	0-4	01	352-3	1000We thus get the very striking result that the British business investment in China is no less than 56 per cent, of the total foreign investment, and is nearly
three times as large as that of her nearest rival, Japan. Of the British business investment in China, 76-5 per cent, is invested in Shanghai and 23-5 per cent, in the whole of the rest of China. The British investment in Shanghai is 3^ times as large as the Japanese. And, finally, by the severance of Manchuria, the Japanese investment in China is reduced to about 37 per cent, of her total foreign investment. -J. T. PRATT.Foreign Office, January 23, 1934.
(14333)[W 14395/663/29] No. 13.Memorandum respecting Japan and the Dutch, East Indies.IN the great Japanese drive for overseas markets no territory has received more attention than the Dutch East Indies. In 1928 Japan occupied sixth place amongst those who shared in the trade of these colonies. Now she stands first. Of the export trade from the Dutch East Indies, only a small part goes to Japan (3 per cent, in 1929, 4 per cent, in 1930, 4-29 per cent, in 1931). Japanese imports, however, have risen from 10 per cent, to 21 per cent, of the whole between 1929 and 1932. In 1928 the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Japan each supplied about a quarter of the textile imports. Since then trade has slumped heavily, but this has not affected the volume of Japanese imports, which have now captured more than half the textile market.In order to promote trade, the Japanese have recently been sending large numbers of commercial travellers to the Dutch East Indies and have opened retail stores in many places. This has been done in such a way as to create the impression that they are spreading a carefully woven net to capture not only the bulk of the import trade, but also the machinery of distribution.The Dutch authorities are considering measures to restrict Japanese trade competition, which is now so seriously menacing their own interests, and an imports restriction ordinance is awaiting signature, but the existence of a most-favoured-nation agreement prohibits direct discriminatory action.A similar state of affairs has also arisen in regard to shipping, not only in the external trade, where it seems that the Dutch may soon be driven off the routes leading to and from Japan, but also in the coastal trade, where Japanese shipping is rapidly establishing a hold. Protective measures will probably have to be taken before long.There is nothing to indicate that the Japanese desire to immigrate in large numbers to the Dutch East Indies, but, in order to be on the safe side, the local authorities have drawn up a law (now awaiting signature) imposing a quota both on Japanese and Chinese immigration. The figure allotted to the former is high enough to include the average of recent years.Dutch opinion is divided on the question of a possible Japanese &quot; menace &quot; to the Dutch East Indies. Those who are the more optimistic believe that nothing more than commercial penetration is being attempted, though this is serious enough in itself; others, however, believe that schemes are on foot which are designed to give Japan an excuse for eventual annexation. It must be admitted that there are some grounds for these suspicions. Japanese fishing vessels are frequently being discovered making charts and soundings, &amp;c, in coastal waters, often at points of strategic importance. At similar places, too, concessions of an obviously non-paying description have been obtained by Japanese companies. (Of late the authorities have taken to refusing applications for such concessions in zones of military importance.) There are even stories of secret aeroplane bases in Borneo. Moreover, Japanese activities are not limited to espionage. Side by side with the Communist movement (which appears to be entirely in the hands of local Chinese working under orders received from Shanghai via Singapore) and with Chinese Kuomintang activities there is also a rather strong nationalist movement, which is a cause of considerable apprehension to the Dutch authorities. There is no doubt that the Japanese are doing a certain amount to help this movement, as forming a useful part of the pan-Asiatic idea recently launched from Tokyo in many parts of the Far East. At present Communist and Kuomintang activities are apparently under control, and are, in any case, hostile to Japan. But if a Sino-Japanese rapprochement occurs, as it probably will do before long, it is feared that the Japanese abetted nationalist movement would be strongly reinforced by the Chinese Kuomintang elements. The danger is that a native rising on a large scale might eventually be promoted, in which case Japan7191   [1008 m-3]9722
would not hesitate, if she so desired, to intervene on the plea of &quot; protecting &apos;y her nationals.If Japan wished, for one purpose or another, to attack Australia, or if she were engaged in a war with Great Britain or the United States of America in the Pacific, she might feel compelled to occupy the Dutch East Indies for strategic reasons. But, apart from this rather speculative hypothesis, the all-important object for such action would undoubtedly be the oil-fields at Tarakan and Balikpapan. The danger is sufficiently real to have caused the Dutch to take steps to ensure the complete destruction of the machinery and borings in case of a Japanese attack.It is possible that the espionage and subversive activities in which the Japanese are engaged in the Dutch East Indies are merely a manifestation of that mania which afflicts them for taking precautions against all conceivable eventualities, and that the fears expressed by many of the local Dutch authorities are groundless. The future alone can tell. At present it may be enough to say that Japan has captured the lion&apos;s share of the local market and that she is doing everything to extend her sway in all branches of commerce.W. R. C.
