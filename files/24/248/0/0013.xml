THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTCONFIDENTIAL. c?1l AFOREIGN OFFICE MEMORANDA ON SITUATION  IN THEFAR EAST, 1933-34.SUMMARY. Memorandum No. 1.Relations with Japan.JAPAN&apos;S economic aims are expansion of trade and the control of sources of raw materials. Her political aims are the development of Manchukuo. expansion into Mongolia and maintenance and development of her position in China. In order to secure her communications with Manchukuo and guard against attack from the air she might be tempted to seize Vladivostok and the Maritime Province. There is in consequence a real danger of armed conflict with Russia, but it is unlikely that there will be war with the United States, because of the close economic interdependence of the United States and Japan, or with the United Kingdom, because Japan would stand to gain nothing from such a conflict.Japan wants a weak China, while we want a prosperous but not necessarily a strong China. Japan is suspicious of aid proffered to China by us or by the League of Nations, and her own attitude towards China will probably alternate between force and conciliation. Short of military measures Japan cannot seriously undermine British interests in China. We have more to fear from Chinese resentment than from Japanese resentment, and we should not therefore be deflected by fear of Japan from maintaining our policy of friendliness with China based on sympathetic consideration for China&apos;s nationalist aspirations. A fortiori we need not hesitate to take such measures as may be reasonably necessary in other parts of the world to protect ourselves against Japanese trade competition (short, however, of a denunciation of the Anglo-J apanese Commercial Treaty). We should also proceed with the Singapore base and strengthen our naval position in the Far East. Our protective measures should not be inspired by any spirit of hostility to Japan. We should be friendly to Japan, but not subservient. We should not oppose her in Manchukuo or needlessly obstruct her trade expansion. But to renew the alliance with Japan would be fatal to our interests in China, entail a breach with the United States and have profound reactions in Canada.
CONFIDENTIAL.Memorandum No. 2.British Policy in the Far East.AT the end of the 19th century Great Britahrs dominating position in China was threatened by the aggressive activities of European Powers. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance enabled Japan to defeat Russia, but when Japan herself then embarked on an aggressive policy particularly during the Great War the alliance damaged our position in China and was viewed with hostility by both America and Canada. The failure of Japan&apos;s aggressive policy made her willing to agree to the new arrangements made at the Washington Conference in 1921-22. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance was terminated, and the naval limitations agreed upon placed Japan in an impregnable position by sea, in return for which she accepted the self-denying and non-aggressive policy towards China embodied in the Nine-Power Treaty.China unfortunately remained in the welter of political confusion caused by the revolution of 1911, unable to set her house in order, but bitterly resentful of the privileged position of foreigners. Under Russian guidance this resentment was turned against Great Britain, the chief architect of the treaty system and chief defender of foreign privilege. In 1925 and 1926 the attack upon the British position became so menacing that His Majesty&apos;s Government decided on a fundamental revision of their policy towards China. Hitherto, as far back as the Mackay Treaty of 1902, His Majesty&apos;s Government had paid lip-service to the ideal of adopting a sympathetic attitude towards the reasonable and legitimate aspirations of the Chinese people. In the memorandum of December 1926 they announced that some immediate measure of satisfaction should be given to China in respect of her claim to treaty revision without insisting on the prior establish ment of a strong Central Government a condition which, in fact, would have meant indefinite postponement of action. The adoption of this policy restored the British position in China. The Russian Bolshevik advisers were expelled in 1927, and the moderate section, of the Kuomintang established the present National Government of China in Nanking in 1928.Unfortunately, their triumph inspired the Kuomintang to attack first the Russian and then the Japanese position in Manchuria. The Russians (in 1929) promptly repelled the attack by force of arms. Undeterred by this failure, the Chinese endeavoured,, by a policy of railway encirclement accompanied by pinpricks to squeeze the Japanese out of Manchuria. For ten years since the Washington Conference Japan had honestly attempted to pursue a conciliatory policy in China. The military party, whose failures in Shantung and Siberia had at that time caused them to be much discredited, now seized the opportunity of the world economic crisis to restore the position by force. Chinese authority was expelled from Manchuria, the State of Manchukuo was set up and Japan has resigned from the League. International relations in the Far East are therefore no longer based on the principle of co-operation laid down at the Washington Conference. Almost immediately on the top of these events came the sudden invasion by Japanese goods of all the markets of the world. The pressure of a rapidly-increasing population a population with a high standard of civilisation and education compelled Japan to become an industrialist State. Her rapid success was due in part to low wages and a depreciated exchange, but these two advantages were given a deadly effectiveness by a well-thought-out policy steadily pursued over a number of years, by good workmanship and by the enterprise and remarkably high standard of efficiency of Japanese industry.The nett result of these developments is that Japan is left in a dominating and unassailable position in the Far East, unhampered by any of the stipulations in the Covenant, the Pact of Paris or the Nine-Power Treaty.
The fears that Japan may shut out other foreign Powers either by dominating China or by entering into an alliance with China have little founda-tion. Domination might be effective for the purpose of maintaining a pax Japonica, but to obtain a regime of special privileges by means of domination would not be possible unless Japan were prepared to proceed to annexation open as in the case of Korea or veiled as in the case of Manchuria but annexation of China, or of any considerable part of China, is not practical politics. An alliance giving Japan all the special advantages and privileges that she covets is also not practical politics. It is unlikely, therefore, that there will be any great change in the relations between China and Japan, and unless Japan were provoked to the point of actually using violence against us, Japanese hostility, though it might be an embarrassment, could hardly inflict vital or even serious injury on our interests in China. There is no reason why we should abstain from insisting on a due regard for British interests.In establishing Manchukuo, Japan, realising the powerlessness of Russia, completely ignored Russian interests. She may possibly intend to seize Vladivostok and the whole Primorsk and extend her empire from Manchukuo westwards into Mongolia. Such a programme, with a hostile Russia on her flank, will leave Japan in no position to embark on adventures elsewhere. The United States will never actually fight Japan (except perhaps for the Philippines), but she will support Russia. After 1936 there may be a naval race between Japan and America and a strong American fleet may be stationed in the Pacific. Japan is not likely, therefore, to seize by force the oil of the Dutch East Indies or the vacant territories of Australia.The actual volume of our trade with China is not great, but the fostering of this trade, owing to the peculiar conditions under which it is conducted, demands a special degree of thought and vigilance. The British merchant has to be pro-tected in the enjoyment of his privileges, extra-territoriality has to be maintained, and the foreign administration of the International Settlement at Shanghai upheld. In view of the uncertain future in the Far East and the possibility of conflict between Japan and Russia, it is essential that the British position and British influence should be maintained, and this can only be done by cultivating the friendship and goodwill of China, and our problem is to do this without any surrender of essential British interests. Towards Japan we should be friendly, but not subservient. In view of the course which Japanese policy is likely to pursue, anything like a renewal of the alliance with Japan is out of the question. America&apos;s general aims and attitude towards China are the same as ours, but in view of America&apos;s attitude towards Japan it is necessary to be cautious about being drawn into too close an association with her.
CONFIDENTIAL.Memorandum No. 3 discusses the question of population and raw-materials in the Far East, with particular reference to Japan, whose population problem is always involved in any discussion of Far Eastern political or economic conditions. Basing itself for the most part on the most elaborate book on the subject, W. R. Crocker&apos;s Japanese Population Problem. (1931), the memorandum shows that Japan has a higher population per cultivable square kilometre than all other countries (993, as compared with 800 for the United Kingdom and 640 for Belgium). The population, now over 66 millions, is increasing at a rate of about a million a year, and although there are factors which may lead to an eventual decline, these are unlikely to operate for the next fifteen to twenty years.After a short account of the population question in other Far Eastern countries, the memorandum discusses the Japanese problem in some detail. The various suggestions for meeting the population increase -it appears that the Japanese Government themselves have reckoned with an increase to 80 millions within the next twenty years are described, in particular colonies, emigration and industrialisation. The inadequacy of the first two is explained on the ground that Japan is unable to compete with the lower standard of living in her colonies and in Manchuria; emigration is practically ruled out, except as a psychological outlet, by immigration restrictions or by Japanese unwillingness to emigrate. Industrialisation is the most effective solution and in this Japan is only following the path of other industrial nations, to whom she is as yet inferior in this respect, being still about 50 per cent, agricultural, as compared with England and Wales 7 per cent. The vital necessity of increasing industrialisation raises the problem of raw materials and markets, and this is offered as one important explanation of Japan&apos;s Manchurian plans. Poor as she is in a supply of the essential mineral fundamentals of modern industry, and lacking cotton and wool, Japan as a whole has come to regard Manchuria as a vital economic necessity for the future and an essential outlet for her during the next years of unavoidable expansion.
CONFIDENTIAL.Memorandum No. $ begins by outlining the economic position of Japan, predominantly an agricultural country (rice and raw silk), but extending rapidly her manufacture of cotton textiles, silk and artificial silk. The woollen industry, too, is now beginning to make great progress, leading to an important development in Japanese-Australian relations, in view of the increasing import of Australian raw wool. The weakest side of her economic position is iron and steel and machinery, but the Government is supporting the industry. Japan&apos;s complete dependence on foreign countries for cotton, wool and rubber, and her partial dependence for iron, coal, oil, wheat, timber and dye-stuffs is shown in some detail. It is pointed out that Japan is now the third largest maritime Power in the world.In the account of Japanese trade markets the importance of the Japanese imperial market, enlarged as it has now been by the inclusion of Manchukuo, is emphasised, being compared with the British Colonial Empire as regards population. Japan&apos;s foreign trade depends mainly on the export of raw silk and textiles, almost all the former going to the United States, who in return send an almost equivalent amount of goods, chiefly raw cotton. The maintenance of Japan&apos;&quot;s textile markets, which in 1932 exceeded the raw silk exports for the first time, is of vital concern to Japan. But the China market is in part permanently lost, and other chief markets, such as British India and Egypt, are developing their own textile industry, with the result that Japan tends to expand into Manchukuo and other foreign countries.Turning to the question of Japanese finance the memorandum finds the picture, at least on a short view, by no means unfavourable, the depreciation of the yen having brought benefit rather than tho reverse. There are certain weaknesses which may affect the financial situation eventually, such as the conflict of interests between agricultural and industrial workers and the heavy burden of armaments expenditure, but these do not appear likely to lead in the near future to any serious deterioration of the financial position.
CONFIDENTIAL.Memorandum No. 5.Gives an account of the Japanese domestic political situation, with particular reference to the preponderating influence of the naval and military elements. The Constitution, modelled on that of pre-war Prussia, favours these influences, and various developments have led the military to free themselves as much as possible from all control by the civil Government.In their aims and ideals, the military party in Japan would find encourage-ment in a reaction against Western &quot; softness,&quot; and in the peculiar dynamic character of Japanese nationalism, assisted as this latter is by the Japanese system of education.In the last few years Japanese party politics have been discredited, and the military party have found several causes for hostility to the civilian authorities, in particular, the Naval Treaty of 1930, the pre-1931 policy of conciliation in China and the greatly increased wealth of the capitalist class. These grievances have led certain military circles to favour a coup cVEtat aimed at setting up a military Government which would restrict large fortunes; a foreign war to put them firmly in the saddle and secure new markets; and, thirdly, an extensive exploitation of these markets by a system of State trading.But the military and naval circles are not all of one mind, and there has been some reaction against the violent excesses of a year or so ago. This, however, does not mean that the danger of power being seized by some extreme military party can be entirely dismissed. At a crucial moment the whole problem of Japan&apos;s future would turn on whether more moderate or drastic views prevailed among those who really have control of the country&apos;s policies.A more hopeful outlook is suggested by the fact that the Japanese are liable to fits of intensity and ardour, but that when these die down they show qualities of gentleness and restraint. There is also an enlightened minority which would react strongly against military fanaticism. Lastly, Japan has her hands full with Manchuria and the North China problem, while, with particular reference to the British Empire, there seems no reason why, if commercial issues can be settled, Japan should not, and possibly will, seek to revive the old Anglo-Japanese friendship in which she would hope to find some security and stability for her future.
CONFIDENTIAL.Memorandum No. 6 deals with Manchukuo, whose independence was declared on the 1st March, 1932; exactly two years later the ex-Emperor of China, formerly &quot; Chief Executive &quot; of the new State, became its first Emperor. A permanent Constitution is still in preparation, and the judicial system, when reformed, will probably be based upon the Japanese model.Manchukuo now consists of five provinces, of which one, Jehol, was added by conquest in 1933, and another, Hsingan, semi-autonomous and largely inhabited by Mongols, has been carved out of the original three provinces. The population of *&apos;&apos; Manchukuo &apos;&apos; consists of about 27 million Chinese (many of whom are of mixed Mongol and Manchu descent), about 2 million Mongols, 750,000 Koreans, and about 300,000 Japanese.Alone of foreign States Japan has recognised &quot; Manchukuo,&quot; which in return has recognised Japan&apos;s special treaty rights and has entrusted her national defence to Japanese troops. Under Japanese guidance, taxation and the currency system have been reformed, the finances of the country have been put upon a sound basis, and banditry at any rate in South Manchuria has been largely suppressed. The economic development of Manchuria is also being carried out with Japanese capital and assistance, and will in a large measure be under the control of the Japanese High Command in Manchuria. While officially, of course, Japan, except in matters of defence, has no say in the affairs of Manchukuo, she in practice controls every branch of the Administration.Japanese policy in Manchuria is largely dictated by her economic interests there. While it is unlikely that emigration to Manchuria will ever solve her population problems, she nevertheless regards the country as a potential market and as a potential source of raw material, the importance of which cannot be exaggerated. She is therefore determined at all costs to render the country invulnerable to attack particularly from Russia and with that end in view has built in these last years a network of strategic railways and roads threatening the Russian frontiers.Apart from Japanese investments in Manchuria, which total between (gold)  150-200 million, the only important foreign enterprise is the Chinese Eastern Railway, in which the Soviet Government hold a commanding interest. This railway has been a constant source of Russo-Japanese friction, which threatened in the autumn of 1933 to develop into a serious conflict. The tension has now been somewhat eased, and negotiations for the sale of the railway to &apos;&apos; Manchukuo &apos;&apos; are in progress. The sale of the railway, if it takes place, should lessen the prospects of a Russo-Japanese war taking place in the near future.The success of Japan&apos;s present venture in Manchuria depends upon the degree of economic advantage which she is able to derive from it in the near future. So far the venture has proved expensive, but the expense will be justified if Japan secures a quick return. Her ambitious plans of economic development may take some years to mature, but the various reforms already accomplished in the financial and administrative spheres, together with the peaceful conditions established in most areas, should increase the purchasing power of the country. In its development it is probable that British interests there may suffer, but, in view of their relatively small importance (British investments in Manchuria, excluding loans, are understood to total less than  6 million, while British imports in 1929 a favourable year -amounted to no more than  684,000), this loss, the memorandum suggests, would seem inconsiderable when measured by the general improvement in the Far Eastern situation which should result from the satisfaction in Manchuria of Japan&apos;s urge towards expansion.
CONFIDENTIAL.Memorandum No. 7 points out that the non-recognition of Manchukuo is based upon the so-called Stimson doctrine, which first found expression in the United States note to China and Japan of the 7th January, 1932. Mr. Stimson himself did not at first realise that it was of the essence of the doctrine that it should be universally adopted. It was largely owing to the initiative of the British Foreign Secretary that by various stages the doctrine was accepted by the League of Nations. In his speech before the Assembly of the League on the 7th March, 1932, the Secretary of State said &quot; Changes brought about, not as the result of methods of conciliation and peaceful adjustment, but by means contrary to the Covenant and the Pact of Paris, manifestly could not receive the approval of members of the Assembly of Nations, which exists for the very purpose of observing these regulations and principles.&quot; The resolution adopted by the Assembly on the 11th March, 1932, declared &quot; that it is incumbent upon the League of Nations not to recognise any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the Covenant of the League of Nations or to the Pact of Paris.&quot;The report adopted by the Assembly on the 24th February, 1933, abstained from saying definitely that Japan had broken any particular article of the Covenant or of the Pact of Paris, but contained the following passage on non-recognition : &quot; The recommendations .... exclude the maintenance and recognition of the existing regime in Manchuria ....&quot; It follows that, in adopting the present report, the members of the League intend to abstain, particularly as regards the existing regime in Manchuria, from any act which might prejudice or delay the carrying out of the recommendations of the said report. They will continue not to recognise this regime, either de jure or de facto. They intend to abstain from taking any isolated action with regard to the situation in Manchuria and to continue to concert their action among themselves as well as with the interested States not members of the League.&quot;The U.S.S.R., in reply to the Secretary-General, declined &quot; to accept the decisions taken by the Assembly of the League.&quot; The United States Government recorded their agreement with the League&apos;s findings: &quot;In their affirmations respectively of the principle of non-recognition and their attitude in regard thereto, the League and the United States are on common ground.&quot; From previous correspondence between the Secretary of State and the American representative, it is understood as between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government that the Assembly resolution of the 11th March, 1932, does not bind the Powers 100 years hence not to maintain diplomatic relations with &quot; Manchukuo,&quot; and it will be noted that the report of the 24th February. 1933, limits the obligation to the &quot; existing regime in Manchuria.&quot;The Assembly appointed an Advisory Committee to whom difficult questions concerning Manchukuo are referred, such questions, for example, as postal services, passports, consuls, opium, &amp;c. It is, however, becoming more and more difficult to ignore the existence of &quot; Manchukuo,&quot; and it is probable that other States will gradually drift into relations with Manchukuo, indistinguishable in practice from the relations they have with States whose Governments have been formally recognised. In the meantime, Soviet Russia is free to recognise at any moment that it suits her policy to do so, and the United States Government, in their communications with the League, would appear to have carefully chosen their language so as not to fetter their future action.
CONFIDENTIAL.Precis of Memorandum No. 8 regarding Russia in the Far East.Shortly after the war the Soviet embarked upon an ambitious campaign for the extension of Russian influence in the Far East. By 1921 Outer Mongolia had been brought into close affiliation with the Soviet Union, while, in China proper, Soviet prestige had been vastly increased by the voluntary renunciation of Russia&apos;s extra-territorial and other special treaty rights.The nationalist movement of 1926-27 was largely organised by the Comintern, and has as its object the &apos;&apos; bolshevisation &apos;&apos; of China as a first step towards world revolution. The plan miscarried by but a small margin the Kuomintang was purged of Communist elements, and Russian influence in China has tended to decline ever since.In certain considerable areas in Central and South China self-styled Communist &quot; Governments &quot; still exist; these, however, appear to be more the products of agrarian discontent than of a genuine revolutionary urge. The tenets of Marxism are foreign to the instinctively acquisitive and individualistic Chinese character, and unless the prevailing economic distress increases, it is unlikely that the influence in China, either of communism or of Russia, will in the immediate future again become considerable.Various attempts have been made by the Comintern to spread propaganda in Japan, Indo-China, Malaya and the South Seas. Except in Annam, where a nationalist uprising of communistic complexion was suppressed in 1928, these efforts have so far borne little fruit.
CONFIDENTIAL.Memorandum No. 9 first describes the Territorial Position in the Pacific Ocean. It sets forth the American and Japanese possessions respectively, grouping the latter under (i) those in which the military and naval status quo is imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty; (ii) those under obligations of the mandate; (iii) Marcus Island, which Japan may fortify if she wishes (but whose harbour has apparently not yet been developed).Of United States possessions, Hawaii and the Philippines are discussed at some length, the latter with particular references to the movement for independence, which, it is thought, might lead to complications with Japan.Lastly, the United States attitude to Japanese aggression is briefly described. Attention is directed to the satisfaction of United States opinion at the time of the Manchukuo decision at Geneva that they were tied to no treaty providing for sanctions, but it is suggested that, in the event of Japanese aggression against the United States a slight risk unless Japan were assured of British benevolent neutrality the United States would attempt to gain British support. Whether, however, the United States would actively assist in the event of Japanese aggression against British or Dutch possessions is probably another matter.
CONFIDENTIAL:Memorandum No. 10 describes the Industrial and Economic Positionin China.(1) Industrialisation of China.The memorandum, with the support of statistical tables, traces the growth during the last twenty years of Chinese industry organised on Western lines. It shows how the dearth of foreign manufactured goods during the years 1914-19 first led the Chinese to undertake the production of them in their own country. The local textile industry was the first to be industrialised and so rapid was its growth under the stimuli of anti-foreign boycotts, the declining value of silver, and the extraordinary cheapness of Chinese labour, that by 1932 its competition had reduced the imports of foreign piece-goods (notably British and Japanese) to less than one-third of their normal volume.Considerable expansion with results detrimental to foreign interests have also occurred in the cigarette, rubber and leather industries. All over China there is a tendency, which is now receiving governmental encouragement, towards the local production of finished utility goods and the displacement by them of the foreign article. From the point of view of the United Kingdom, however, the loss to Manchester and to our light industries provoked by this development has been compensated by an increasing demand for British heavy machinery destined for the equipment of China&apos;s factories. It must be remembered nevertheless that while at the moment the United Kingdom dominates the machinery market in China, Japan has lately appeared as a competitor in it, and may soon become as serious a rival in the production of, for instance, textile machinery, as she already is in that of textiles themselves.(2) The Economic Position in China with Special Reference to theDecline in Exports.. The memorandum traces the almost continuous growth, during the last half-century, of China&apos;s visible adverse trade balance. With the aid of statistical tables it shows that while the annual value of imports into China increased between 1882-1932 some fourteen times, that of exports from China increased a bare eight times. As a result her visible adverse trade balance had grown by 1932 to about fifty times that of the 1882 figure.The failure of China&apos;s exports to keep pace with her imports is due to a variety of causes, both inevitable and fortuitous. Having embarked upon a career of &quot; Westernisation &quot; and industrialisation, China requires the products of the West in quantities which are only limited by her purchasing power.. The need of the West, however, for China&apos;s products is far more accidental and less fundamental. Chinese tea, once an important export, has been displaced in Western favour by Indian tea. Chinese silk has been driven off the markets of the world by &apos;\ rayon &apos;&apos; and the less costly Japanese silk, and with the recent fall in the European price of butter, the demand for soya beans, so largely used in the manufacture of margarine, has sensibly decreased. It must at the same time be remembered that the nature of China&apos;s exports is predominantly agricultural, and that China&apos;s rural economy has suffered disastrously in the civil disturbances of the last twenty years.Nevertheless, recent researches tend to prove that, at any rate until the beginning of the present economic depression, China&apos;s real adverse trade balance was much smaller than the statistics of her foreign trade would suggest. Remittances from Chinese overseas, undervaluation of exports (for purposes of
tariff evasion) and the expenditure in China of foreign residents and tourists would appear generally to have squared the account. In the last few years, however, overseas remittances have suffered a severe decrease and the serious economic situation of the country has given some cause for concern. It should be remembered, however, that throughout her long history China&apos;s economy has always displayed an inexplicable and unsuspected vitality. Some small amelioration therefore of world, or of her own internal, conditions may possibly result in a significant and rapid increase of her purchasing power.

The value of her market lies rather in its incalculable potentialities when some degree of political stability is once restored, and communication with the interior has been extensively developed. The maintenance, from the political point of view, of our favourable position in this potentially important market must depend, in view of our geographical remoteness, less upon physical force than upon Chinese goodwill; and the promotion of this goodwill has exercised a profound influence upon British policy of recent years, leading us even at one time to envisage the surrender of our treaty position to the nascent force of Chinese nationalism.The rise of Japan in the Chinese sky has been far more spectacular than ours. Before the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 her interests in China were comparatively unimportant; but within twenty years, by conquest, she had vastly extended her Empire at China&apos;s expense and had secured a commanding position in China&apos;s economy. Taking advantage of the Western Powers&apos; preoccupation with the Great War, she sought to establish a hegemony over China, and if the attempt was defeated at Washington in 1922, the idea was never abandoned.The liberal and pacific policy of the Western Powers particularly of Great Britain born, as it was, of the exhaustion and disillusionment provoked by the war, found little favour in Japan, who has never suffered defeat nor been impoverished by victory. By the end of the war her trade with China, whither went one-fifth of her total exports, had surpassed in importance our own, and China had become the repository of some (gold)  230 million of her investments  80 per cent, of all her capital exported abroad. In these circumstances, it is scarcely strange that Japanese policy in China should in the years following the Washington Conference have tended increasingly to diverge from that of His Majesty&apos;s Government, until the Manchurian outbreak of the 18th September, 1931, and the subsequent withdrawal of Japan from the League of Nations in February 1933, marked the final rupture with the pacific ideas of the West.There are signs that Japan, left in a dominant yet isolated position in the Far East, has lately conceived the idea of establishing at the expense, notably, of British interests, a close alliance with China, designed to give her a commanding control over that country&apos;s future, both political and economic; negotiations for the purpose of settling outstanding difficulties between the two countries have been proceeding for the last nine months, and while up till the time of writing they have not yet reached any definite conclusion, it seems probable that Japan, by virtue of her commanding military position, can dictate to China at any chosen moment such terms of alliance as will best suit her interests.The prospects of such an entente, with results detrimental to British interests, cannot be discounted, and it is doubtful whether an exclusive reliance upon Chinese goodwill would in that event provide us with an adequate defence against Japanese ambitions. We are a comparatively unimportant customer of China, and from a military point of view our capacity to harm her is as small as is our inclination to do so. But Japan, in contrast, is in normal times China&apos;s most valuable customer, and is a great and ever-present military danger to her. In these circumstances, will China prefer the abstract benefits of British
friendship to the more concrete advantages of appeasing a superior IcustonieK^oda menacing enemy ? -- -- -----If Japan continues to act in selfish isolation in China, the results may be disastrous both to British interests and to the future of China herself. The immediate problem would therefore seem to consist in the evolution of a method by which the Chinese policy of Japan and of the Western Powers notably of Great Britain can be reconciled to the mutual advantage of everyone,.;and particularly of China.

CONFIDENTIAL.Memorandum No. 13.Describes the relations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. These are primarily commercial; from being sixth in 1928 in the trade of these colonies, Japan now stands first, and half the textile market is supplied by Japan. The Dutch authorities are now considering measures to meet this competition, and it is possible that protective measures will have to be taken also in regard to shipping, where the Japanese are also rapidly establishing themselves. The Japanese have shown no desire to emigrate in large numbers to the Dutch East Indies, but an immigration quota law applying to both Japanese and Chinese has been drawn up.In regard to Japanese political designs on these territories, Dutch opinion is divided, some observers holding that only commercial penetration is intended, others believing that Japan has designs for eventual annexation. There are some grounds for these latter suspicions, and concessions in zones of military importance are now being refused to Japanese nationals. But all this, like the idea of Japan being compelled to occupy the Dutch East Indies for strategic reasons in the case of war with Great Britain or the United States, is in the realm of speculation; the immediate reality is that Japan has captured the lion&apos;s share of the market and is doing everything possible to extend her commercial sway.
