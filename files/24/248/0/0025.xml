The improvement during the month was most marked in building and publio works contracting, the clothing trades^ and boot and shoe and pottery manufacture.     Other industries to show improvement include iron and steel, engineering, shipbuilding and repairing   and vehicle building.Employment declined in dock and harbour services, and in the jute, tinplate and glass bottle industries;    there was also a slight net decline in the coalmining industry owing to an increase in the numbers temporarily stopped in the North Eastern area.-1-.SNTIAL. A.0.289/BOARD OP TRAPS ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE OP TRADE - FEBRUARY&quot;. 1954.Summary of Reports, submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (Supplemented in some oases with statistical information from other sourcesTTEmployment.     The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in great  Britain at 19th February, was 2,317,909, a decrease Of 7i,159 as compared with 22nd January.     The number wholly unemplbyed, including casuals, decreased by 56,816, and the number temporarily stopped by 14,343.The ohanges between 19th February and 22nd January, in the different divisions were:-
Overseas Trade.     Imports in February were  57.4 m. and exports  30.1 m.  compared with  49.1 m.  and  27.9 m. respectively in February, 1933.     Of the increase of  8.3 m. in imports,  5.0 m. was in raw materials, including 32.4 m.  for wool and  1.1 m. for cotton.     Exports of imported merchandise were  5.2 m, as against  4.5 m. and transhipments under bond  2,3 m. against  1.9 m.  in February, 1933.      The excess of imports over exports of merchandise amounted to  22.1 m. as compared with  16.7 m.Rail and Road Traffic.     During the four weeks ended25th February, 1934, the railway traffic receipts were  704,000more than in the corresponding period of 1933, and for the eight weeks ended February 25th the increase was  1,427,000. Thepercentage increases in the various classes of traffic were:-4 weeks ended     8 weeks ended 25th February.    25th February,-%---Jo      T.Passenger Traffic........... 1.98 1,75Merchandise, Minerals and livestock .,............... 15.41 16,06Goal, Coke and Patent Fuel .. 3.31 3.98Preliminary figures for 1933 show, as compared with 1932,increases of 1.5^ in the volume and 1% in the value of passenger traffic, and of X/* in the tonnage conveyed by freight train.The principal increases in freight traffic were in iron andsteel, &quot;bricks, iron ore, pig iron, and limestone for blastfurnaces,     There was a decrease in the tonnage of road makingmaterial.The number of motor vehicles other than motor cycles newly registered in January, 1934, was 8,935 (48.6?$)  greater than in January, 19330     The increase comprised 6,115 private cars and 2,820 goods and other vehicles.     Registrations of motor cycles showed an increase of 825 (33.2;&amp;).Retail Trade.      The value of retail sales in January,  1934, was 3.9$ greater than in January, 1933.      This is the fourth
consecutive monthly increase.      The improvement was spread over the whole country and affected all departments except fancy goods.     London and the South of England had the largest percentage increases.     The principal improvements were in furniture (15.0:*), hardware (9.9^) and men&apos;s and hoys&apos; wear (8.3^).     Sales of food and perishables vjere also up.     Stocks in January showed a reduction in value of 0.7f$.Finance and Banking; ( l) United Kingdom.      In the early part of February attention was centred on the large movement of gold from Europe to the United States, due to the adoption by president Roosevelt of a gold bullion standard with the price of the metal at $35 per fine ounce.     The new price at first offered an attractive premium over the price ruling on this side, but exchange rates gradually re-acted and towards the end of the month the rates had settled down to a point at which the profit on shipping gold across the Atlantic had become negligible. Large quantities of gold continued to be purchased, however, in the London market mainly, it is believed, on United States Account. Money was in fair demand throughout the month.      Bill rates showed a tendency to weakness helped probably to some extent by a demand on French Account.In the latter part of the month interest turned to the stock markets where great activity prevailed.     practically all sections have participated in the upward movement of prices, the rise in gilt-edged issues being partly due to the good revenue returns, and to discussions on the possibility of British Government credit moving towards a 2^,j basis.     There was also a fair Continental demand.    Indian and Australian stocks have moved upwards, the latter aided by a further conversion operution bringing the total conversions since October 1930 to  11,0 m.     The end of the month was marked by noticeable, if guarded, optimi sm.
s* Prance *     The outflow of gold ceased after the early-part of the month and the franc has since held its ground. It is yet to he seen how M. Doumergue will use his special powers to balance the budget not only on paper but in fact, end. how far the public will be prepared to make sacrifices, keanwhile there remains the economic problem that the internal price level is above the world level, and Is still rising, Unless world prices rise sharply end quickly the maintenance of the gold standard must on the last resort depend on the ability of the French people to stand the hardships of deflation.s* Germany.      That internal trade is improving is reflected in taxation receipts which were 10?$ more for last January than for January, 1933.      The increased receipts from tobacco and beer duty show that the improvement is reaching the consumer.     Foreign trade is, however, still shrinking;    for January the excess of imports was RM. 31 m. , the figure for exports being the lowest monthly figure for some years. In some sections of the export trcde the view is held that exports cannot be maintained without depreciating the j/ark;   but Dr. Sch&amp;schatcht, the President of the Reichsbank, recently declared that it is in Germany&apos;s interests for the present gold parity to be maintained and thet efforts will be mode to extend the system of &quot;additional exports&quot;, made possible by the acquisition at a considerable discount of blocked marks, Konvorsionskasse scrip and German external bond issues. Dr. Sohachfs speech had a reassuring effect on the Bourse. Reichsbank gold and foreign exchange holdings declined further during February, mainly owing to the amount of foreign exchange needed for increased Imports of raw materials, but the decline in exports was a contributory factor.
(4) United states of America.     Labour and the &quot;small&quot; producers have been criticising the H.R.A. &quot;codes&quot;, the former saying that labour is not sufficiently -well treated, the latter that the tendency towards monopoly will ruin them.     The Administration met these criticisms by putting forward, at a con t3i*ouce to consider the codes, proposals to shorten working hours, to raise wages and to give greater protection to the independant producer.     There is also criticism of the Stock Ilxchange     Regulation   Bill on the ground that it will hamper legitimate business.     There was strong opposition to the proposed winding-up of the Civil Works Administration by May 1st, which would have added some 4,000,000 men to the unemployed at present estimated to number some 7,000,000;    and the president has since proposed relief measures which in substance differ little from the existing scheme.     The Senate has voted amendments to the Economy Bill - including restoration of V/ar pensions and of Government servants&apos; pay cuts - which add $304 m. to the Budget.The Presidents request to Congress on March 2nd for powers to make trade agreements with foreign countries involving some revision of tariffs, and his speech of March 5th indicate that he appreciates that if exports of agricultural products are to be increased the industrial tariff must be lowered and imports of manufactured goods must be increased.      The creation of three export credit banks suggests that America may also seek to increase her exports by a revival of foreign lending.Since iiovemher last there has been steady improvement in economic activity.      Steel mill activity has increased from 277$ of capacity in November to 47.7;!t of capacity in February and the motor industry is very active.
Ooal.    The average weekly output of ooal during the 13 weeks ended 17th February. 1934, was 4,593,000 tons compared with 4,407,000  tonB a year previously.    The average numbers of persons employed during the above period was 700,700, compared with 782,400 a year before; and the average weekly output per person was 5.89 tons, compared with 5.63 tons. Exports in January amounted to 94$ of those in January, 1953. Increases were shown by the exports to Norway, Sweden and Denmark, Germany and France.    Home consumption was 15$ higher in January,  1934 than it was a year ago.Shipping. The index number of shipping freights (1913 ^ 100) for February, 1934, was 81.24 as compared with 81.37 in January, and 79.32 a year ago.    The net tonnage of shipping laid up at the beginning of 1934 was 1,239,000 tons compared with 1,971,000 tons at the beginning of 1933.Iron and Steel. Quieter conditions have prevailed in the iron and steel industry  ..during February, due probably to heavy buying earlier.    Most works are, however, fairly well supplied with orderc mostly on domestic account, as the export market still remains disappointingly low.    The home demand for pig iron remains active despite the recent advance In prices; there were more furnaces in blast last month and preparations for resuming at additional furnaces are in progress.    Although the volume of new business in semi-finished steel is less than earlier In the year, most works are experiencing pressure for delivery.      The demand for finished steel products is irregular, but plates, rails and sections are benefiting from the greater activity in shipyards, on railways and in the building trades.    Some increase In foreign enquiries is reported.In Scotland inoroased production has been maintained on the whole and there is a slight improvement in the case of finished sections and plates.    The better conditions are
largely attributable to increased activity In the shipyards and seem likely to continue for some months.    Orders from the engineering and structural trades are disappointing. Inquiries are better in the export business, and certain orders which have been booked are attributed to recent trade agreements.On the North East Coast orders and enquiries again increased and the outlook for the next few months is encouraging.    There is a better demand from the shipyards, the structural engineering trades and the railway carriage and wagon builders while with the motor-oar manufacturers business has appreciably expanded.In South Wales trade is steady with rather less now business in some departments, notably heavy steel products and galvanised 3heets for exports.    The tinplate industry is operating at 50$ to 60$ of capacity, but sales have recently increased.      Foreign competition in sheet and tinplate bars is negligible and producers are fairly busy.ln Sheffield basic steel production has reached the record level of 2,000 tons a day, with acid soeel at rather more than half this rate.    Foreign orders  ire scarce chough tool exports have recently 3hown a tendency to increase and enquiries from India and China are in circulation.    The home demand generally is very active, especially that for hollow forginga in connection with oil refining, electrification and hydrogenation schemes.    The steel strip, bright drawn steel and stainless steel departments continue active.electricity.    During February 1,343 million units were produced, as compared with 1,152 million in February 1933, and the increase this year over the first two months of 1933 is 15.6$.      The percentage of productive capacity for electrical apparatus in use rose to 60;&apos; being some 10$ more than in January.    Orders received for he^vy plant in the home market are somewhat lower than a year ago but there was a
considerable Increase on the same basis in export orders.    As regards light apparatus the demand in the home market fell slightly in January, but as compared with a year ago exports showed some expansion.Wool.    Activity in the Industry,  though considerably better than a year ago, showed a decline in January as compared with December both in the woollen and worsted sections.    The percentage of unemployed operatives increased from 9.2$ in December to 11.2$ in January as compared with 20.9$ in January 1933.      The index of machinery activity fell from 85.0$ in November to 84.4$ in December and 82.5$ in January. Exports of tops, yarns and tissues increased.      Raw wool prices rose again, the indioes being:    for wool 102, as compared with 97 in December and 58 in January, 1933;    for tops 111, as compared with 103 and 67;    for yarns 121, as compared with 114 and 83.      It seems that these higher prices are restricting demand, a tendency which will be   -more marked in the case of worsted than in woollen, owing to demand turning to cheaper grades.Motor industry.    The approach of the Budget announcement has aroused speculation whether there will be a reduction of the horse-power tax on motor vehicles.    The industry holds the view that reduced taxation would encourage production and so increase its power to meet the renewed competition of the United States of America in overseas markets since the devaluation of the dollar.      The full effect of the competition has not yet been felt owing to difficulties of delivery.In Denmark the prospects are brighter than ever before; although the system of import licences is tending go prevent sales which could otherwise be effected.Building. The statements of the Minister of Health on Slum Clearance and on the houses being built under the Subsidy Acts have led to a more hopeful spirit and the Spring seasonal improvement has already begun.    Building plans approved for
February show an increase of  750,000 over January and an inorease of  1,500,000 over February, 19330 Owing to the bigger demand; raw material prices have increased slightly.Machine Tools.      The improvement in home business continues, except that the demand for heavy tools is still disappointing.    Foreign trade is unsatisfactory owing to restrictions: total exports in February were  75,5G5 as compared with  83,246 in January.        Imports were  89,839 as against  119,311 in January.      Russia took over 20$ of our exports in February but American competition for the Russian market is likely soon to become severe.Chemicals.      Home and export trade in alkalis and heavy chemicals showed little change In February.      Sales of dyes tuffs were substantially higher than in February, 1933. There was, however, some decline in demand from the textile trade.      The demand for wood distillation products and for all types of coal tar products was excellent, and even the pitch market is brighter.     Apart from seasonal goods the market for pharmaceutical products is limited.Soap, oil and kindred industries.      The demand for soaps continues steady.      The margarine market is affected by the exceptionally low prices for butter.      There was a slight improvement in the demand for edible oils and fats.EMPIRE.Canadian Trade.    The index of the physical volume of business inoreased in January to 86.3 as against 86.2 in December, and the index, of commodity prices moved from 69.0 to 70.6.        Stock exchange prioes advanced and exports of silver, nickel and zinc showed expansion.    The meat packing Industry showed some improvement but there was a decline in flour milling and sugar and the index of production of food products as.a whole fell to 74.1 as against 97-4 in December The lumber and paper industries showed improvement.    The production of steel ingot3 and of motor-cars showed an increase but pig iron production diminished.    The general
index f or -manufacturing fell- from&quot; 88,,6 -iai.. December &quot;to 80.7 in January.Australian Trnde-,     The number of hales of -wool received into store from July 1st, 1933 to the end of January, 1934, was 2,340,418.      Of these, 1,837,794 boles have beon disposed of by sale or shipment,      The price of wool is still rising.      Compared with the corresponding periods of the previous year, &quot;butter shipments have fallen, hut egg shipments, which have now ceased, show an increase of 2m.  dozen.      Total imports in January showed an increase of over  500,000 Australian as compared with a year ago and for the 8 months ended February increased hy over  900,000.South African Trade.      There has &quot;been general improvement in trado owing to the prosperity of the gold mines.     A rough index shows that business activity in 1933 was 12 to 13^ above 1932.     Exports in 1933 other than gold totalled  25 million as against  20.5 million in 1932,      Gold exports were  47,785,010 at the standard price or  68,428,588 at the price of gold throughout the year, as declared hy the Chamber of Mines.    In December the total value of exports of merchandise was 31$ more than in December, 1932, hut practically no maize was exported. The value of imports was 65$ greater than in December, 1932, and in 1933 imports amounted to  49 million, as against  32^ million in 1932,     Revenue has exceeded expectations and a fairly large surplus for the fiscal year is predicted.Notwithstanding floods and locusts the agricultural outlook is brighter;    the manufacturing industry also is busy and in some sections, notably the building and motor-car trades, almost boom conditions prevail.Indian Trade,      Imports of merchandise in February were 875 lakhs of rupees, as compared with 922 in February, 1933. Exports amounted to 1,281 lakhs as compared with 1,245.      The balance of trade for the month of 1,418 lakhs is the highest since December, 1931.     The index of wholesale prices (July 1914 - 100) was 90 in January and 89 in February.-10-

The octive trade balance in 1933 was approximately half that in 1938.     Exports in January and February -were 40.4;&amp; in paper pesos above the corresponding period of 1933, but account must be taken of the 12^&apos;depreciation of the peso In the meantime in terms of sterling.     Imports in 1933 from all major countries showed increases, those from Japan in particular amounted to ovor 50$ more by value than In 1932. The United Kingdom had 28%% of the total trade in 1933, as against 30$ in 1932, but the excess of exports to over imports from the United Kingdom was reduced from  40 million to  28 million.      The number of British steamers which arrived at Argentine ports in 1933 was 37$ of total arrivals, a decrease of over      on 1932.An increase of half a million tons on last year fts estimated for the wheat harvest, and the area under maize is 8.8^&apos; more than last year.The working of the Exchange system is causing dissatisfaction and British importers and public utility companies claim that they are not receiving the advantage in exchange allotment
stipulated in the Roca Agreement.Negotiations are in hand for a commercial treaty with Japan.As the policy of the Government is to foster national industry, British exporters will need to seek business in commodities which cannot be produced locally.Brazil.      3y the 4th Funding Agreement recently announced Brazil proposes to pay  33 million in the next four years against foreign liabilities of about  90 million.     The requirement of  8 million per annum under this scheme was not covered by the export balance in 1933 which was  7.2 million or nearly 60% below that of 1938.     The depreciation of the milrois has led recently to better prices and larger exports for coffee, but stocks are 50$ more than a year ago.Chile.      There was a small Budget surplus in 1933, as against ta large deficit in 1932.     A Japanese cotton delegationis endeavouring to secure the market largely held by British firms in yams, threads and artificial silk goods.Colombia.      The peso continues to depreciate owing to large purchases of armaments abroad.     Imports from the United Kingdom, particularly of cotton piece goods, increased considerably in 1933.
