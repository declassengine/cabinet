EERY SECRET c9 lNo.   40 ----                               CABINET----0.P. 1.02 ,(84) -RTjBBER PEGTJLA.tion SCiflME 241Memorandum by the Socretarjr jtf J^a&apos;.9, ..&apos;.^9.-g0^-.0:a,^.9.31.     I have now received from the Dutch Government a definite statement of the way in which they propose to operate the rubber restriction ocheme in the Netherlands East Indies.2.     The Dutch Goverment will accept the International Scheme in the form egreed in the recent negotiations.   The essential features of this scheme are -(1) The basic tonnage of each country is  greed.(2) The International Committee -will fix from time to time the percentage of baBic tonnage which may be produced and exported, ice., both production and export are controlled so that stocks cannot accumulate.(3) New planting is prohibited.The Dutch Government will therefore undertake to carry out the restriction scheme effectively in their territories,3.     The method, by which the Dutch government will operate the scheme within the Netharlands East Indies is set out in the attached statement which has been personally approved by Dr. Oolijn.4.     The Dutch Govemnent have prepared the necessary Ordinances for bringing the scheme into operation.   They propose to submit these to an extraordinary session of the Volksraad of the Netherlands East Indies, which can be done at
2A   :.S9at a fortnight&apos;s notice.   In the event of opposition in the Yolksraad, Dr. Colijn undertakes to pass the scheme by Royal Decree.   He also intends to go personally to the Netherlands iDast Indies at the beginning of  -lay.5. I am further informed by the Dutch Government that the majority of officials in the Netherlands Sast Indies are in favour of the scheme, which I regard as important.6.     The Dutch Government lay stress on the vital importance of an early decision,   The British industry fully shares this view.7.     An agreement has been reached with Siam winch the British and Dutch industries regard as satisfactory.   They have expressed their keen appreciation of the action of Mis Majesty&apos;s Government and our representative in Bangkok for achieving this.8.     The recent increase in consumption has ms.de it possible to contemplate a considerably larger quota of production than had originally seemed possible, a fact which should materially facilitate the operation of the scheme.9.     We have always agreed that we could not approve a scheme unless it had the support of the large majority of the British producers:   I informed the British Producers Committee that the concrete proposals of the Dutch Government when formulated would be submitted to them for their considered opinion,   I propose therefore forthwith to take this course.I
2^3i rv -u O3,-10.     I am advised that it is practically certain that the D-jtch proposal will be accepted &quot;by all, except possibly Dual troops, who want special privileges for themselves, which no prodiicerc, British or Dutch, are prepared to give.. . I think this acceptance is right on merits.   The Dutch scheme is not ideal;   but their administrative problem is much more difficult than ours.   And I am convinced that Dr. Colijn would not give his undertaking and stake his reputation on a plan unless he was satisfied he could carry it out.11.     Even if we had not the confidence in Dr. Colijn which I think we all feel, it would be impossible to reject a scheme, which conforms to the conditions we laid down at the World Conference, which is guaranteed by the Dutch Goverment, and which our own industry supports with practical unanimity.12.     If, as I anticipate, the British industry endorse the Dutch plan, I propose to arrange with tho other Governments for signature and announcement at the most convenient moment. It is of course essential that no premature announcement should be made0(initd.)   P.C.-L.Colonial Office,10. April 1954.Annex
2,4     4.&quot; Annex.Stet^ont by, Jbh^DutcfcL;GfovB&apos;n^nt.During th8 discussions of our committee held at the Colonial Office on 12th Liarch 1934 several questions have &quot;been raised by the British representatives regarding the legislative and administrative measures prepared by the Netherlands Indies Government for the restriction of the native rubber production and exports.   The Secretary of State had expressed his wishes to get full information about the scheme of native rubber restriction applied in our Indies, which requires measures of a special character, adapted to the conditions under which our native rubber growers are working.After having received more detailed information on tiie progress made with the preparatory work by the Netherlands Indies officials I am able to give a full e-answer to the following important questions, already discussed at our former meeting:-a. Temporarily the exports of native rubber will be restricted &quot;by means of an export duty pro kilogram, which will be levied regionally;   the total quantity that may be exported being stipulated for each region the rate of the duty will be fixed according to this;b. A definite scale of the tax will not be fixed because experience must show at which level the duty curtails exports sufficiently as to make the restriction effective. The Netherlands Indies Government guarantees that the fixed quantities of exports under the scheme will not be surpassed ;
c. The proceeds of the duty will bs used in behalf ef the rubber-growing  districts:   (1) by dird.nishing other taxeson native population;   (2) by financing generally appreciated local public works,The possibility of buying surplus production as well as redundant rubbsr trees (although very difficult) with the proceeds of the tax is still studied.d. The Netherlands Indies Government has declared that the export duty system is only a preliminary one, but as no certainty is yet prevailing that another system of restriction will prove to be efficiently applicable to native exports the period during which this system must be continued cannot bs fixed at the moment, efforts being me.de to limit the transitory method to one year only.   Among the definite systems of restriction which eventually will have to replace the export duty the quota system is the principal one.e. A quota-system that will prov6 to be practicable for the native rubber districts cannot yet be explained in detail because this system will be based, afterwards on the results of preliminary local investigations^which are already started..In consequence of the great variety of local conditions on the different islands it is improbable that one system for the whole native producing areas will prove to be effective.f. Although the sharp rise of native exports have charged their actual quantitative proportion in the total exportsit will be still possible to maintain the relative figure of estates and native exports, which has been fixed by the Netherlands Indies Government in accordance with the Dutch estate-owners.   However I must lay some stress upon thecire mi stance
circumstance that things are growing more and more difficult in this respect and as a matter of fact in consequence of the steady rise of prices and of exports of native rubber a further deley will make the basis of this proportion inequitable and therefore untenable0g. It must be fully agreed that new plantings of native rubber after having been forbidden by special ordinance will be still possible and an effective control will prove to be difficult, especially in the remote hill tracts.However it is improbable that any substantial new planting will be realised by the native producers as they are in possession even now of a very important area of tappable but untapped trees.   The Dutch estate-owners fully agree that no real danger for later years will be caused by this circumstance.h. For the purpose of controlling rubber stocks the exports will be permitted only by licensed and administered exporters, whose stocks will bo registered and limited according to the rules of the agreement;   for producers and dealers stocks of rubber will be limited generally in the same way.i. For the Netherlands Indies territory outside the custom-boundaries - being a part of the Riau-Lingga-Archipelago - the levying of an export tax is not possible. For these islands exports of native rubber will be bound to special licenses for which a cess will be levied equal to the amount of the export tax in the neighbouring districts.The
The general conclusion of the Netherlands Indies Government, baaed on the actual situation of the rubber market and the progress made in the legislative and admini-strative preparation of the restriction is, that, fully recognising the difficulties have been growing during the recent months, the preliminary system of the export duty although restraining native production very sensibly still appears to be effective in limiting native exports within the   bounds of the restriction scheme0   A further delay however would be detrimental to the working; of the scheme because the difficulties will soon prove to be unsurpassable 0Therefore itis of the utmost importance that Siam will agree in participating in the international agreement and (full accord between the English and Ketherlands Governments once being reached) the legislative measures in all the adhering countries will ccrae into force as quickly as possible.
