THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1934.SECRET. Copy No.       4 4CP. 68 (34).CABINET.CONSEQUENCES OF A BREAKDOWN OF THE DISARMAMENTCONFERENCE.I.THIS paper is an attempt to formulate some of the consequences which may be expected to follow if the effort to reach a Disarmament Convention definitely breaks down. The reception given to the British Memorandum of the 29th January abroad, and particularly the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s report of the respective attitudes of Germany and France, make it clear that an impending breakdown is probable. Our memorandum does not go far enough for Germany, e.g., Herr Hitler insists that Germany must be granted a large air force immediately, while the indications are that it will be regarded as going too far for France, at any rate unless we increase and render more definite the guarantees for due execution. And any uncertainty as to what will happen about disarmament cannot be long delayed, both because Parliament will insist on an account of what has recently been happening and an appreciation of the prospects, and because Mr. Henderson has fixed the resumption of the Bureau for the 10th April. This is little more than four weeks off, with Easter intervening, and an objective estimate of what would follow the declared failure of the Disarmament Conference therefore requires immediate consideration.2. The first and most obvious consequence would be that Germany would rearm at pleasure without any stipulated limit and without any international supervision. The Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control was withdrawn in 1927 and, since the evacuation of the Rhineland in 1930, Germany has been making a series of graduated experiments to see whether anyone would stop progressive breaches of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. Even since the Hitler regime, Germany continued anxious lest someone should seek to intervene to stop rearmament. But the recent indications are that Germany is increasingly confident that she can disregard her treaty obligations without effective rebuke. France called our attention to alleged breaches of the treaty last year and invited an exchange of information; the War Office were strongly opposed to this course, and we were ultimately driven to disappoint the French by saying that we did not think the time was opportune for such joint investigations. The big psychological change is that Germany now feels pretty sure (subject to the fear, which is becoming fainter, of a French reoccupation of the Rhine bridge-heads) that if she goes on rearming she will not be stopped. Once the Disarmament Conference breaks down, Germany will regard her moral claim for rearmament as greatly strengthened and will allege that the breakdown proves what she has long declared was the case, that the victorious allies never meant to disarm and have used the period of the disarmament discussions as a means of prolonging the inequality.3. This first consequence of a breakdown will soon be followed by a second. It will not be long, we may expect, before Germany openly flaunts her rearmament at any rate, it will become increasingly difficult to profess not to notice it. Proposals which we have put forward for extending Germany&apos;s right to rearm as part of the terms of a new international convention will be quoted (just as the concession of equality of rights has been quoted) as though they were[9768]
unconditional admissions of Germany&apos;s right. We shall therefore find ourselves in the embarrassing position of either having to acknowledge patent violations of the Peace Treaties or of professing ignorance or uncertainty as to breaches which everybody knows are taking place. Indeed, if Germany comes to the conclusion that there is no prospect of legalising her illegal armaments, she may prefer to take the bull by the horns and repudiate Part V of the Treaty of Versailles outright.4. Two further consequences will add to our difficulties. On the one hand, we shall be challenged in Parliament and in the press to say whether such and such breaches of the Treaty of Versailles are not being perpetrated by Germany; if we profess doubt, we shall be pressed to make enquiries. If we admit the fact, we shall be asked what we are going to do about it. And, in the second place, the French will return to the charge and will urge with much force that, inasmuch as there is now no prospect of reaching a disarmament agreement with Germany, Britain should be prepared to take up with France the question of Germany&apos;s flagrant breaches, either by bringing the matter before the League of Nations under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles or in some other way. How is this demand.to be met? Yet complaint to the League under Article 213 is only too likely to lead to a further repudiation of the Treaty by Germany; she will decline to agree to a commission for enquiry on the spot, notwithstanding that she undertook in the Treaty to provide facilities for it, and will contend that the failure to agree upon international disarmament justifies her refusal. All this threatens to lead, by a shorter or longer route, to the disturbing issue of sanctions, as well as to a series of disagreements with the French Government (see memorandum of the 9th February text attached).5. Meanwhile, the external consequences indicated in the above paragraphs will stimulate and be accompanied by a strong and ever-increasing demand from Parliament and from public opinion for our own rearmament. It will be said, of course, that we led the way in unilateral disarmament and that it has turned out to be premature and dangerous instead of providing an example which others would follow, and instead of our own further expenditure on armaments being moderated in view of the defined and supervised limits set to the armaments of others, the need for further protection at home will be increased by the failure to put any restraint upon the rearmament of others a most unhappy outlook from every point of view, threatening profound reactions in the financial and social sphere and in the whole position of the Government. It may be said that, even if Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals were accepted and agreed to, these would equally establish the need for large rearmament on our own part, but the failure to reach agreement and the omission of international supervision are surely serious aggravating factors. There is a great difference between limited rearming in order to be in a position to fulfil obligations as signatories of a Convention and competitive rearmament as the result of a breakdown.6. There remains the estimate which must be made, as best we can, of the political consequences of a disarmament breakdown in their bearing upon our relations with our neighbours and the future of Eui&apos;ope. In the paper which I circulated almost exactly a year ago (the 28th February, 1933), called &quot; The Crisis, in Europe &quot; (CP. 32 (33)), I called the attention of the Cabinet to the consequences of a final breakdown of the Disarmament Conference which was then threatening and which was only staved off by the production of the United Kingdom Draft Convention. Paragraph 7 of that paper urged that when the breakdown came &quot; it would be essential that our relations with France should be of the closest kind &quot; and that &quot; political, strategic and economic considerations in favour of such an alliance with France may thus be compelling.&quot; If Germany is going to become as strong as she chooses in the air as well as in other ways, good Anglo-French relations will be more important than ever. And this is equally necessary from the point of view of general policy, for when the Disarmament Conference collapses the value of the League of Nations as an effective international influence threatens to be reduced to vanishing point. As long as the League of Nations functions with reasonable success and international co-operation is an effective mode of life, the moral authority of this country weighs heavy in the scale, and her moral authority stands tremendously high. But if these institutions and ideas collapse, moral authority will be no substitute for sufficient armed strength.
7. I would invite my colleagues to examine the above analysis, and, if they accept the estimate of the results which would follow a disarmament breakdown, to agree that the threatened breakdown of the Disarmament Conference and consequent return to pre-war conditions of competitive rearmament involve consequences to this country of so serious a character that it is necessary to examine the objections taken to the recent British Memorandum with a view to seeing whether, by further concession and by additional undertakings, there is any means of bringing about agreement.8. I do not conceal my own view that this can only be done by meeting, more fully than we have yet done, French demands for security. On this basis alone, as it seems to me, is it possible to reach agreement also as to the German claim (which will not be abandoned) for a substantial air force. Guarantees for securing the due observance of an Arms Convention appear to be a more limited and precise commitment than the acceptance of what is called security against the aggressor. We may get the French answer about the British memorandum in a few days, and, whatever else it contains, it is likely to insist that France could not be party to such an agreement unless it was accompanied by what the French call guarantees for its due observance. Last December the then French Government gave to Mr. Henderson a document, which he forwarded to me, which contained their ideas on this subject. It is printed as an annex to this paper in order that my colleagues may see what the French then said. I fully realise the force of the criticism that the proposals are vague in themselves and threaten to raise many difficulties and objections. But should we not, without loss of time, examine them, together with the report made by . Mr. Elliofs Committee to the C.I.D., which is just being circulated to the AUiUoI^umJL) am so deeply impressed with the really terrible dangers which may C^i^^ijtez ultimately confront our country if, in a few weeks&apos; time, we are faced with a complete disarmament breakdown, that I think we should examine afresh the only alternative, distasteful and unacceptable as it may seem to many to be, in this choice of evils.J SMarch 9, 1934.ANNEX.French Proposals (given to Mr. Henderson) on Principles to GovernGuarantees of Execution.IN case of a duly established violation of the convention, the Permanent Disarmament Commission shall request the offending State to comply with its obligations within a period of time to be fixed by the commission.2. From this moment, and pending the establishment of the fact that the violation has ceased, the offending State will cease to benefit by the guarantees of supervision resulting from the normal operation of the convention (right to take part in commissions of investigation, to lodge a complaint, to suspend certain provisions of the convention, &amp;c).3. If the violation that has been ascertained is of a sufficiently serious character, the violation of the convention will be assimilated to a violation of the Pact of Paris, and the offending State will ipso facto cease to benefit by the provisions of that pact.4. A committee of inspection shall be sent to the spot to ascertain that the violation ceases within the prescribed time.5. If the violation continues after the time fixed for its cessation, it shall be the duty of the other contracting parties to put into operation, by joint action, the means of pressure necessary to assure the execution of the convention.6. These means of pressure will be economic and financial in character. The  convention  shall  enumerate  the  principal  means,  leaving  it  to  the
Disarmament Commission to adapt their application to the circumstances, and to the gravity of the particular offence (for instance, the offending State should be prohibited from raising loans in foreign markets; the Convention on Financial Assistance should come into operation on behalf of the State which it has been recognised is menaced by the violation that has been committed; economic relations should be interrupted; imports from the offending State should be boycotted; and part, or all, exports to the offending State should be forbidden, &amp;c).7. The Permanent Commission might eventually go further; it might recommend the rupture of diplomatic relations; request the signatory States to render technical assistance to the countries threatened by the violation that had been committed, in order to enable them to deal as rapidly as possible with the dangerous consequences that might ensue to themselves from the start gained by the offending State, for instance, in the manufacture of forbidden, weapons.8. If war broke out as a result of the violation of the obligations assumed, there would be a presumption of aggression against the State that had been guilty of this violation.The convention should also provide that regional agreements might be adopted between States particularly concerned for the respect of the limitation of armaments in a particular area, in order to make clearer the regional application of the principles thus laid down.Finally, it goes without saying that the moment the violation had been duly established, any signatory Power which considered itself threatened would have the right temporarily to suspend the application of the provisions of the convention.
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCENTRAL (Germany).February 9, 1934.CONFIDENTIAL.Section 1.[C 969/20/18]No. 1.Memorandum on the Possibility of a French Demand for an Investigation into the State of German Rearmament under Article 213 of the Treaty ofTHE French Government have on more than one occasion alluded publicly, in connexion with the disarmament discussions, to their right, under article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, to ask the League Council to institute an investigation into the state of German rearmament.2. The question of appealing to this right has been mentioned several times in the French Chambers also, and it has frequently been canvassed by the French press.3. At the end of December 1933 the French Cabinet went so far as to agree among themselves that if Germany were to reject the final French disarmament offer which, as at that time contemplated, was to be made at Geneva in the following January, France would raise the question of German rearmament under article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles.4. According to the opinion expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Paris on the 5th February, the possibility of a French appeal to article 213 is perhaps somewhat more remote at the present time than it was at the end of last year. There is always the danger, however, that circumstances may suddenly deteriorate in such a way as to call the French threat into operation, and the object of the present paper is, therefore, to consider the possible effect in present circumstances of an appeal in the connexion indicated to article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles.5. Article 213 provides that &quot; so long as the present treaty remains in force Germany undertakes to give every facility for any investigation which the Council of the League of Nations, acting if need be by a majority vote, may consider necessary.&quot;6. In the first instance, the French Government may wish to do no more than provoke at Geneva a discussion which will secure publicity for the facts about rearmament as stated in the French dossier. Q But once embarked upon such a course, it would be difficult for France, without loss of face, to avoid its developing into a demand upon Germany by the Council of the League for an investigation, and we are bound, therefore, to assume such a development.7. The following is the effective membership of the Council of the League (Germany and Japan being omitted) : 8. It does not seem that the issue in the Council would be immediately carried to a straight vote on the expediency of a demand upon Germany for an investigation. On receiving the French request, the Council might first decide to ask the German Government for their observations and to submit the French request to a committee for report. We should almost certainly be asked to serve on this committee. The report, if not unanimous, as would be probable, might contain majority and minority views. The Council would in any case ultimately have to decide by a vote on the necessity of the investigation.0) See Ffpncli Ambassadors communication of August 4, 1933; Germany print, August 4, Section 1.Versailles.Argentina.

9. Although with the present composition of the Council the result of such a vote might well up to the last moment be in doubt, it is difficult to suppose that the French would sponsor a request to the Council for an investigation unless they were certain of carrying it. Failure to do so would for them signalise the breaking in their hands of the principal weapon (proof of German rearmament in contravention of the treaty) with which they have always stated their intention of rebutting the German claim that the ex-Allies have themselves failed to honour their promises under the preamble to Part V.10. It must here be observed that a difference between Britain and France on such an issue would place us in a most unsatisfactory position. We should have been divided from France on a critical matter, on which it would be difficult for us to maintain that the French contention was unjustified. Further, unless we were extremely careful, we might be regarded as indifferent to German rearmament, which would certainly be rapidly continued and would already have included the alleged military training in the associations of 2^ million men in defiance of the provisions of the treaty.11. Were the Council to decide in favour of a demand upon Germany for an investigation neither we nor the French can well suppose that, in her present temper, Germany would admit it upon her territory. In fact the probability must be foreseen that Germany might retort by formally repudiating article 213 and with it possibly the whole of Part V of the treaty. Her argument would be that she had not wished to take this formal step and had hoped by negotiation with the other signatories of the Treaty of Versailles to obtain the elimination of Part V by agreement, but that the Council by its action in trying to enforce at this late stage the servitudes imposed by Part V had compelled Germany to assert her equality of treatment by the only means open to her, namely, by claiming unilateral repudiation. Such an open challenge by Germany might again place His Majesty&apos;s Government in a very difficult position, especially if, as is probable, public opinion in France had been aroused by these occurrences to the point of demanding immediate coercive measures against Germany involving the employ-ment of force on German territory. The adoption of such measures, however, without previous recourse to the machinery provided for the settlement of Franco-German disputes, would, except in one case (which will be dealt with in para-graph 12), involve a violation by France of her obligations under the League Covenant and the Treaty of Locarno, and as such would have to be carried out in opposition to His Majesty&apos;s Government. For technically Germany&apos;s formal repudiation of her treaty obligations as indeed the. lesser action of simply refusing to submit to an investigation under article 213 would constitute, in the language of the Covenant, nothing more than a &quot;dispute&quot; between Germany on the one hand and the other signatories of the treaty on the other, and as such would not authorise either France or any other Power to proceed at once to coercive measures against Germany; on the contrary, the restrictions imposed by the Covenant and by the Treaty of Locarno would compel France to submit the &quot; dispute &quot; to a judicial settlement or to conciliation, or eventually to a decision of the League under article 13 or 15 of the Covenant. Only after this procedure had been finally exhausted and Germany still remained recalcitrant would France be entitled to take forcible action against Germany, and then only if recommended unanimously by the Council.12. It would be practically impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to stand aside during the hearing of this &quot; dispute.&quot; We have always maintained that Germany had no right to free herself from her treaty obligations by unilateral action, and oh this account, if for no other, we would have to join with France in fighting the case before the various tribunals appointed for the purpose.13. But supposing we thus co-operated with France, when we eventually reached the point where all the methods for settling the &quot; dispute &quot; had been exhausted without avail, France would be likely to raise with us the question of the joint coercion of Germany. It is probable that the British and French views on this subject would not be the same, but our liberty of action would have been to a certain extent prejudiced by the mere fact that we had collaborated with France up to this point.14. There still remains to mention one case where the question of coercive action might arise at an earlier stage. This case would arise if France were able to prove to the satisfaction of the League Council that Germany&apos;s illegal
rearmament had, at the same time, involved a violation of the Demilitarised Rhineland. In that case His Majesty&apos;s Government (and the Belgian Govern-ment) would be bound &apos;&apos; to come immediately to the assistance of France &apos;&apos; (see Part 2 of article 4 of the Treaty of Locarno). But such assistance need take the form of military action only if the violation was in the unanimous opinion of the Council sufficiently serious and flagrant as to justify a decision by it, in accordance with exception No. 3 in article 2 of the treaty permitting its repression by military action by France. In estimating the degree of seriousness attaching to the violation it is not unlikely that the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the French Government, as members of the Council, would not coincide. 15.   To sum up (a) If the French raise the question of German rearmament under article 213,it is probable that the Council will sooner or later have to vote for an investigation. A majority vote is sufficient, but the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government will nevertheless be embarrassing.(b) If an investigation is ordered, Germany will almost certainly decline to submit to it and may take the opportunity to repudiate the whole of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. This again will be embarrassing for His Majesty&apos;s Government.(c) In such an event His Majesty&apos;s Government would be practically boundto co-operate with France in fighting the resultant &quot; dispute &quot; before all the various tribunals provided for the purpose. Alternatively, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to oppose France if she attempted to coerce Germany before exhausting the above legal remedies.(d) Once these legal remedies had been exhausted and Germany still remainedrecalcitrant, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to be prepared to discuss with France the question of joint coercive action against Germany.   This might lead to an awkward situation.(e) If the alleged rearmament of Germany involved a violation of the demilitarisation of the Rhineland, France can, provided that she is able to convince the Council voting unanimously that the case is sufficiently flagrant and serious to warrant military action by France in self-defence, not only claim the right to take coercive measures straight away, but can also call upon His Majesty&apos;s Government to come to her military assistance under the Treaty of Locarno. In estimating the degree of seriousness attaching to the violation there might be disagreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and France on the Council.Foreign Office, February 9, 1934.
