ECONOMIC PRESSURE ON GERMANY.Report.I. Origin, Composition and Terms of Reference.THE Committee of Imperial Defence, at its meeting held on the 6th April, 1933,* agreed to approve the Summary of Measures that can be taken to exert Economic Pressure on an Enemy, prepared by the Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War, and to refer the question of exerting economic pressure in a situation not involving a formal declaration of war to the Advisory Committee.2. The Chairman of the Advisory Committee accordingly directed that a Sub-Committee should be set up, with the following composition and terms of reference : Composition.The Right Hon. Walter Elliot, M.C., M.P., Minister of Agriculture and&apos;Fisheries (in the Chair). Sir Henry Fountain, K.C.M.G., C.B., Board of Trade. Sir William Malkin, K.C.M.G., C.B., K.C., Foreign Office. Mr. O. G. Sargent, C.M.G., Foreign Office. Captain H. R. Moore, D.S.O., R.N., Admiralty.Commander C. C. A. Allen, R.N., Committee of Imperial Defence, Secretary.Terms of Reference.3. To examine the general problem of exerting Economic Pressure on a foreign country in a situation not involving a formal declaration of war, and to ascertain to what extent our existing preparations can be adapted to such a situation.4. On the 12th May, 1933, before we had started our consideration of the general question of exerting economic pressure in a situation not involving a state of war, the Prime Minister directed that we should test our proposals by special application to the case of Germany. It appeared possible that Germany might attempt to rearm, and the problem for consideration was the circumstances in which measures could be taken to compel Observance by Germany of her obligations under Part V (Military, Naval and Air Clauses) of the Treaty of Versailles.5. We have therefore confined ourselves in this Report to considering whether effective economic pressure could be exerted on Germany with the object of compelling her to observe her disarmament obligations, in a situation where there has been no resort to war, and, consequently, Article 16 of the Covenant is not applicable.II. Preliminary Considerations.6. It is important to make plain the essential difference between the situation described in the preceding paragraph and that which would exist in a case where Article 16 was being applied. In the latter case, it would, under the Covenant, be the duty of all the Members of the League to co-operate in the exercise of their rights and obligations under Article 16, and they would, accordingly, be equally bound to abstain from economic and financial relations with Germany, and to take all steps in their power to make the exercise of economic pressure upon her effective. In the case which we are now considering, only a certain number of Powers directly interested to prevent the rearming nf Germany would be concerned; they would have no right to expect assistance under Article 16 from the other Members of the League (or, of course, from non-members); they would not possess the rights of belligerents, and, in fact,* O.I.D./258th Meeting, Minute 4.
their activities would be confined to such economic pressure as they could effect by action taken within their own jurisdiction. The other countries of the world would have a perfect right to continue commercial relations with Germany, and the Powers concerned would have no right to interfere with them. The operations of those Powers would, in effect, be limited to such action as was taken during the Avar under trading with the enemy legislation.7. There is one possible hypothesis on which the considerations set forth in the preceding paragraph might not be applicable, or not fully applicable. The circumstances in which Germany rearmed might be such that her action would be generally regarded as constituting an immediate threat to the peace of the world, and the appropriate organs of the League, acting in pursuance of their peace-preserving functions under the Covenant, might (either under Article 11, Article 13 (4) or Article 15 (4)) recommend the members of the League to co-operate in exercising economic pressure against Germany, with a view to the termination of the threat to world peace. We deal with this possibility in a later passage of this report, but for the present we confine ourselves to the case where the economic action against Germany would be confined to a limited number of Powers, while the other nations of the world would retain their right to continue economic and financial relations with that country.8. In these circumstances the pressure which could be exercised by the Powers concerned would be confined to action on the following lines. They could refuse to allow any goods to be exported from their territory to a German destination, and they could refuse to admit to those territories any goods from Germany, or of German origin. Generally speaking, they could forbid all persons within their jurisdiction to have any financial or commercial relations with Germany. Ships flying their flags would not be allowed to trade to German ports or to carry German goods, nor would German ships be permitted to trade to their territories. The necessary powers to effect these results would have to be based on some common agreement between tho Governments concerned, reached by diplomatic negotiation, followed so far as this country is concerned by legislation on the lines of the Trading with the Enemy Acts, and, presumably, by some legislative procedure in most, at any rate, of the other countries concerned. Such action would, in the case of this country, and probably in that of some of the other countries concerned, involve a violation of the instruments which at present regulate their commercial relations with Germany, but as the foundation of the action taken would be Germany&apos;s violation of her treaty obligations in relation to disarmament, our action would presumably be justified on the grounds of retaliation. Our treaty obligations to third parties under such instruments as the Barcelona Transit Convention would, however, require consideration and might, in some respects, limit our freedom of action.III.-Countries ^ljkely. ,tO;, Co-operate.9. In estimating the extent to which Germany would be susceptible to the consequences of economic pressure of the character indicated above it is necessary to consider which Powers could be expected to co-operate in the exercise of such pressure. For the sake of argument it is justifiable to proceed on the following-hypotheses : (1) Of the Powers particularly concerned in preventing Germany&apos;s rearmament, the only ones which can initially be counted on to join in exercising economic pressure would be the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Poland and the Little Entente (Czecho-Slovakia, Roumania and Yugo-Slavia).12) Of other Powers whose co-operation would be important if the economic pressure is to be effective, the most that can be forecast is as follows : (a) The British Dominions, the United States* and Italy (all of them except the United States being parties to the Treaty of Versailles) might, if political circumstances were favourable, be. ready to co-operate in. the exercise of economic pressure.   The present report* Although the United States is not a party to the Treaty of Versailles, her own Treaty of Peace with Germany reproduces all the disarmament provisions of that Treaty, thereby giving the United States a locus standi for insisting- upon their observance.[9192] n 2
is based on the assumption that this would be the case. In any case it may be said straight away that such pressure could not possibly produce the desired result unless the United States, and (at any rate) some of the Dominions, participated in it.(b) Russia is not a party to the Treaty of Versailles and would certainly refuse to co-operate. The Argentine also is not a party to the Treaty, and it is highly problematical whether she would agree to co-operate; moreover, her example would probably be followed in a greater or lesser degree by the rest of the Southern and Central American States, even though some of them, such as Brazil, are parties to the Versailles Treaty. The present report is based on the assumption therefore that none of these countries would co-operate.(c) There remain the neighbours of Germany who are not parties to the Treaty of Versailles, i.e., Holland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Baltic States, Austria and Switzerland. Although some or all of these States might be in sympathy with the object of the boycotting Powers, it is doubtful whether any of them would be ready to co-operate unless those Powers were prepared to give them a guarantee of security against German aggression or retaliation. In this report it is assumed that none of these States would co-operate.IV. League Machinery.10. Before anything in the nature of economic pressure could be applied, it would be necessary for the Powers exercising such pressure to proceed in accordance with their Treaty obligations in order to seek a settlement of the dispute. A Memorandum by the Foreign Office is attached as an Appendix, the relevant conclusions of which are as follows : &quot; (i) In the event of a violation by Germany of her disarmament obligations, it is essential that the complaining Powers should proceed in strict accordance with their obligations under the Covenant and the Treaty of Locarno, even if the coercive measures contemplated do not involve the use of force;(ii) Normally, the first step would be a request to the Council of the League of Nations to carry out an investigation under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles;(iii) If the result of the investigation is to establish facts regarded as constituting a violation of Germany&apos;s obligations, the resulting dispute must, if between Germany and France or Germany and Belgium, be submitted, according to its nature, either to judicial settlement or to i conciliation, followed, if necessary, by reference to the League under Article 15. If between Germany and the United Kingdom, it must go either to the Permanent Court or to the Council;(iv) In the event of Germany refusing -to, submit the dispute to judicial settlement or to comply with ah arbitral or judicial decision, the matter must be brought before the Council under the last paragraph of Article 5 of Locarno;* * * * * *(vii) Subject to any difficulties arising from instruments like commercial treaties, measures, such as economic pressure,.not involving the use of force would be permissible (whether or not the Council had made a unanimous recommendation to that effect), assuming that the procedure prescribed for the settlement of the dispute had been adopted.&quot;11. It is the action to be taken under conclusion (vii) above which forms the subject of our Report.V. &quot;Pacific Blockade.&quot;12. At this stage it may be convenient to consider one form of action of which the possibility may be suggested, i.e., a so-called &quot; pacific blockade &quot; of German ports. There have in the past been several instances of pressure of this sort being effectively exercised, but never against a naval Power of any importance.
For this and the following additional reasons we think that the possibility of its being effectively applied in the present case must be ruled out. In the first place, the precedents are in favour of the view that a pacific blockade cannot be enforced against the merchant ships of third parties, and there is at least one case on record where this country successfully maintained this contention. This being so, it seems certain that any attempt to enforce a pacific blockade against countries not participating in the economic measures against Germany would produce the most serious difficulties; but if the blockade were not so enforced, it would be bound to be ineffective. In the second place, it is, at any rate, doubtful whether, under the Covenant and other instruments, such as the Pact of Paris, a pacific blockade is permissible in any circumstances except where it is imposed with the authority of the League of Nations.13. Further, if any attempt to use the naval forces of the participating Powers to enforce a policy of economic pressure were made, and Germany provided naval escort for shipping destined to or leaving German ports, the naval forces of the participating Powers would either have to let them pass unmolested or attack the escorting man-of-war. In these circumstances a state of war might ensue, and the participating Power whose ship resorted to force might be represented as the primary aggressor.VI. German Trade.(Note. Powers we have assumed would be co-operating are printed in heavy type.)14. This Section of our Report is devoted to a study of German Trade, while the next Section reviews the possible effects of economic pressure on Germany in the circumstances envisaged. In Section VIII we consider the effect on the United Kingdom of such a policy. Owing to the widespread nature of our trade and business connections, the reactions might fall more heavily on us than on the other Powers applying pressure.Imports Food Products. 15. Germany is normally self-supporting in meat, potatoes, and cereals for both bread and fodder. As regards fish and fish products, normally half the German supplies are imported, mainly from the United Kingdom, Norway and the Netherlands, but the German fishing fleet, if allowed to extend its opera-tions, is sufficiently large to be capable of supplying a considerable part of the fish now imported.16. Germany is dependent as to 25 per cent, on imported eggs, and relies to a considerable extent on imports of butter and cheese. The principal sources of supply for these are : Butter : Denmark and Russia.Cheese : The;Netherlands:        :        &apos;    -17. The main food commodities for which Germany is wholly dependent upon overseas supplies are rice, coffee and cocoa, the principal sources of supply being India, Brazil and Central America, and British West Africa respectively.18. The most important group of food-stuffs for which Germany is practically wholly dependent upon outside sources of supply is oil seeds and nuts, edible oils and fats, and oil-seed cake; the principal sources of supply for these commodities are: The Whale Fisheries, Newfoundland, for oils and fats; Manchuria and the Argentine for oil seeds and nuts; Denmark, India, Russia and France for oil-seed cake.Imports Raw Materials. 19.   Germany is entirely dependent upon outside sources of supply for the -following raw materials, the principal sources of which are as follows :   Cotton : The United States. Flax : Russia. Hemp : Italy. Jute: India.Rubber: Dutch East Indies, India and British Malaya.
20. In addition to the above, Germany is almost entirely dependent on imported supplies of wool, largely from Australia, South Africa and the Argentine. It would appear that stocks of wool do not exceed one month&apos;s supply, and those of cotton do not exceed about two months&apos; supply. Stocks of rubber may represent as much as one year&apos;s supply.21. As regards hides, Germany is dependent on imports to the extent of about 50 per cent, of her requirements; the principal source of supply being the Argentine.22. Imports of iron ore, mainly from Sweden, represent about two-thirds of the total supply. Stocks of iron ore were reported last April to represent about 10 months&apos; normal import, and are probably now somewhat larger. Stocks of pig iron are also reported to be very large, while it is known that Germany has for some time been importing large quantities of steel scrap.23. Germany is practically entirely dependent upon imported copper and tin. As regards the former, the principal sources of supply are South Africa, the United States, Chile, Belgium and the Belgian Congo, and stocks were reported in April to represent not more than two or three months&apos; supply, but have increased recently, and it is thought that stocks have nearly doubled. Tin is imported from many different countries; no information as regards stocks of tin is available.24. In addition, Germany is dependent in normal times to a considerable extent on imports of non-ferrous metals and ores, as shown below : Bauxite ...   Hungary, 44 per cent.;  France, 28 per cent.;  Italy,27 per cent.Zinc metal       ...   Russia, 48 per cent.;  India, 40 per cent.cent, from imported ore. Manganese ore ...   Russia, 48 per cent.; India, 40 per cent. Pyrites ...   Spain, 60 per cent.; Norway, 30 per cent.Nickel... ...   Canada.Quicksilver      ...   Italy; Spain.Wolfram   (Tung-    The world sources of supply are approximately as stem ore) follows:    China,   8,000;    India,  2,500;    UnitedStates, 1,000; all tons per year, and smaller quantities from Malaya, Australia, Spain and Portugal.These non-ferrous metals and ores are of particular value for the production of munitions, and it is interesting to note that during the first six months of 1933 Germany&apos;s direct imports of nickel from Canada have doubled as compared with the corresponding period of 1932, while Holland, through which Westphalian industries import heavily via Rotterdam, has taken six times as much nickel oxide and three times as much fine nickel. - -  - ......Petroleum Products.25. The total quantity of petroleum products imported into Germany amounts to some 2^ million tons per annum; the total consumption is over 3 million tons, the balance being provided from indigenous sources. In 1932 more than half the imports of petroleum products came from the United States of America and Russia.VII. Possible Effects on Germany of Economic Pressure.26. In considering the extent to which Germany could evade the consequences of economic pressure, it is necessary to analyse the foregoing study of Gei&apos;many&apos;s import trade in relation to the countries we have assumed would, or would not, co-operate in exerting economic pressure. It must always be remembered that, to the extent to which re-exportation through non-participating countries is practicable, the supplies from whatever original source will become available to Germany.
Imports Food Products.27.   The chief German imports of food products derived wholly or partly from the participating Powers are as follows : Fish: United Kingdom, Norway, Netherlands.As stated in paragraph 15, Germany could extend the operation of her fishing fleet, and would retain her sources of supply in Norway and the Netherlands, which might be extended.Rice: India.China might afford an alternative source of supply. Oil Seed Cakes: India, France, Russia.German supplies from Russia could be augmented.28.   In regard to food products, it would appear that economic pressure in the circumstances envisaged would have little, if any, material effect.Imports Raw Materials.29.   Germany&apos;s essential raw materials, so far as the participating Powers form part or the whole of the sources of supply, are as follows : Cotton: United States of America.Russia is a potential source of supply, but Germany might experience a shortage of this commodity when existing stocks ran low. Brazil, Central America and China afford alternative sources of supply.Wool: Australia, South Africa, Argentina.Germany would lose the first two sources of supply, but by increasing her imports from the Argentine and drawing on a potential source of supply from Russia she would go some way towards meeting her requirements.Petroleum Prodtocts : United States of America, Russia.The deficiency caused by the stoppage of imports from the United States of America could, to a certain extent, be made good by increasing the output of crude oil in Germany and by increasing the production of oil products from coal. In addition to Russia there would be available as alternative sources of supply Venezuela, Mexico and the Dutch East Indies, and in view of the over-production of oil products, Germany should experience little difficulty in counteracting the cessation of supplies from the United States of America.Rubber: India, British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.The deficiency caused by the stoppage of imports from India and British Malaya could be made good by increasing the imports from the Dutch East Indies. As in the case of petroleum products there is an over-production of rubber in the world at the present time.Hemp : Italy.Germany would lose this source of supply. Alternative sources of supply are Russia and the Baltic States.Jute : India.Germany would lose this source of -supply, for which there is no. alternative.   Substitutes for jute could, however, be employed.Copper: United States of America, Belgium, Belgian Congo, South africa and Chile.As Germany would lose four of her principal sources of supply she might experience some difficulty in maintaining her supplies.Nickel: Canada.Germany might experience difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies of nickel. It should be noted, however, that Norway supplied Germany with considerable quantities of nickel during the war and has, in recent years, produced about 800 tons of nickel per annum.
Other non-ferrous metals and ores Germany would experience some difficulty over other non-ferrous metals-and ores such as zinc metal (United States of America, Canada, Australia) and manganese (Russia, India).30. In this connection it must be remembered .that Germany acquired valuable information in the war with regard to the utilisation of substitutes for many strategic raw materials, and this information will be available for future use in addition to any post-war work in this direction.31. Another factor to be borne in mind is that there is, generally speaking, a large over-production of most commodities in the world to-day, the rarer metals and ores excepted, and alternative sources of supply for many imports should be readily available.32. It would appear, therefore, so far as raw materials are concerned, that, with the possible exception of certain metals and ores, such as copper, nickel, zinc metal, &amp;c, the effect of economic pressure of the character proposed would not be great.33. It has been suggested that if Germany were, in fact, aiming at speedy and complete rearmament, the cutting off of metals and ores required for munition making would produce an immediate effect and would ultimately force her to submit, even if other commodities were still available to her. This argument could only be valid, if in the meantime Germany had not laid up stocks of the metals and ores in question and in so far as the participating Powers can control these particular supplies. It has been indicated above that in the case of copper and nickel at least considerable stocks have already been accumulated, whilst in the case of some other metals and ores adequate supplies could be obtained from or through non-participating countries.Exports.34. The effects upon Germany of a restriction of her exports can be considered under two heads : (1) The effect internally upon Germany of a partial cessation of themanufacture of goods for export; (2) The effect upon her purchasing power of a reduction of her export markets.35. The first effect would be felt, whether or not the embargo upon imports was made effective. The result of cutting down the German export trade would be a rise in the level of unemployment in Germany proportionate to the diminution of German trade.36. As regards the second effect that is the effect on Germany&apos;s purchasing power Germany &apos;s chief markets are Soviet Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Holland, Switzerland, the United States of America and Belgium. Of these, it has been assumed that the United Kingdom, United States, France and Belgium would be co-operating in the action proposed.37. We have considered the possibility of bringing pressure to bear on Germany merely by a decision on the part of the countries concerned to exclude German goods, but have been forced to the conclusion that there would be too many countries affording export markets to Germany to allow of material results being achieved. In any event, the disastrous financial consequences indicated later in this Report as certain to follow a policy of economic pressure on Germany would in no way be mitigated by the adoption of this less comprehensive policy.German Shipping.38. The bulk of German shipping is engaged in services to or from German ports. As it is assumed that all countries participating would be debarred from using German ships and from supplying them with bunkers and essential stores, it follows that economic pressure, if effective, would result in the laying up of a considerable quantity of German shipping.
Finance.39. The immediate effect of economic pressure would be to transform into -a complete default the partial suspension of Germany&apos;s external obligations which is already in operation, and thereby to relieve German banks and industry of a substantial volume of debt. There might also be danger of repudiation in certain directions. German credit abroad would, no doubt, be destroyed, but it is probable that there is still a large volume of German assets in foreign countries, and it would be extremely difficult to prevent the withdrawal of such balances.Loopholes.40. The period that would necessarily be taken to operate the machinery for the settlement of the dispute, provided by the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Treaties of Locarno (see paragraph 10) would probably enable Germany to accumulate extensive reserves of specific commodities before economic pressure could be applied. In addition we have indicated in the foregoing paragraphs that considerable loopholes in the form of alternative sources of supply would exist whereby Germany could evade the consequences of economic pressure even when in full operation. From the experience of the War, we anticipate that re-export trade would very soon spring up in non-participating countries which it would be quite impossible to stop and would, to a considerable extent, circumvent the action taken by the participating Powers.41. Apart from the opportunities for trade by countries not participating in the application of economic pressure, we doubt, particularly in view of the number of limitrophe States, involving numerous avenues of .approach to Germany, whether the Powers pledged to impose economic pressure could be entirely relied upon to make it effective. Though in the case under consideration, national sentiment might be hostile towards Germany, there would, in all probability, be many people both in this country and in other countries partici-pating in the measures, who either disapproved of the policy altogether, or, who were prepared to seize the opportunity to make a profit by evading the restrictions. The moral deterrent to evasion would be weak; the inducement to profit strong.42. In view of these loopholes we consider it highly problematical whether even with the co-operation of the Powers mentioned it would be possible to exert economic pressure which would be effective.VIII. Effect on the United Kingdom.43. In paragraph 14 we pointed out that whatever the effect of economic pressure on Germany, there would be a considerable reaction on the trade of the United Kingdom as well as of the Dominions,- India and the Colonies. This Section of our Report is devoted to a detailed survey of the effect on the trade of the United Kingdom in particular, under the following headings : Imports.   . .,!(.,    .  i Exports. .  Shipping. The Coal Trade. Finance.Imports from Germany. Food Products.44. The principal imports under this head are sugar, wheat, eggs, fruit, potatoes, wines, meat and yeast. With the exception of yeast these are all food-stuffs in which there is an over-supply in the world. Yeast might cause some immediate difficulty, as about 30 per cent, of our imports in 1931 came from Germany, but increased supplies should be readily forthcoming from other Continental sources and from home production.Raw Materials.45. The principal imports are wood pulp, hides and skins, furs, timber, vegetable oils and agricultural seeds. All these materials are readily obtainable from, other sources at home or abroad. Temporary difficulties might arise over the cessation of supplies of a few special materials, but, generally speaking, substitutes are readily available.[9192] c
Manufactured Goods.46. In general, our manufactures and those of Germany are competitive, and no difficulties as to supplies should arise except in specialised products.47. There are a number of cases where German manufactures are the raw material of our industries, and considerable dislocation would be caused while supplies from home and foreign sources were being expanded. Potash, for instance, an important fertilizer, is drawn largely from Germany, and although the French control the Alsace deposits and supplies are beginning to arrive from the Dead Sea, there might be a serious temporary shortage.48. A similar position might arise with such products as acetic anhydride and oxalic acid, which are used in the manufacture of dyes or in dyeing itself, and some classes of synthetic dyes would not be procurable.49. There might also be some difficulties over chemical porcelain, certain scientific and optical glassware, specialised machine tools and machinery (especially textile), hosiery latch needles and electric carbons.50. There would also be a cessation of supply of many fine chemicals (mainly used as drugs) subject to Key Industry Duty. Many of them could, of course, be made here after an experimental period and at a cost.Exports to Germany.51. The main items in our export trade with Germany are as follows : Fish, coal, raw wool, waste and noils, cotton yarn, cotton piece-goods, woollen and worsted yarns, woollen worsted tissues, and machinery.52. Germany is by far our most important market for fish, especially cured herrings. The loss of the German trade might be a serious matter for the fishing-industry.   Germany is our main market for raw wool, waste and noils.53. Cotton yarns account for nearly one-third of our total exports to Germany of manufactured articles, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the loss of the German market would be of serious consequence to the fine spinning section of the Lancashire industry. This loss might be partially offset by obtaining some of the German trade in the goods for which these yarns are used, but it is evident that considerable dislocation and loss of trade would result.54. The machinery industry would, no doubt, gain far more from a cessation of the imports from Germany than it would lose from the loss of the German market, and, similarly, the woollen and worsted industry should, on balance, gain considerably from a cessation of trade with Germany.&apos;55. It has also to be remembered that there is a very considerable re-export trade to Germany; the main items are butter, tea, coffee, furskins, rubber, raw wool and leather.56. Finally, certain of the Dominions and Colonies have a very valuable direct trade with Germany, particularly British India, British East, South and West Africa, the Commonwealth of Australia and Canada.British Shipping.57. Economic pressure on Germany would affect British shipping in various directions. There is a large volume of trade between this country and Germany amounting in 1931 to approximately  96 million. Of the cargoes carried, probably about one-third are in British bottoms and the effect so far as the trade was not replaced by purchases and sales from and to other countries on the British lines engaged in this trade would be serious. Ten to fifteen per cent, of British coastal and home trade tonnage is engaged in trading with Germany.58. In addition to the trade between this country and Germany, the trade of the Empire with that country amounts to approximately  57 million and of cargoes carried, probably 50 per cent, go in British ships. This traffic would also be lost, except so far as the trade was replaced by purchases and sales from and to other countries.
nOn the other hand, the restricted field for German tonnage would mean certain benefits to British shipping.59. At the present time many of the big German passenger liners call at ports in the United Kingdom, both inwards and outwards, and convey considerable numbers of British passengers, whereas the big British passenger liners do not call at German ports. The effect of stopping the German liners would be to bring increased passenger traffic to the British ships.60. Under existing conditions many British overseas cargo liners call at German ports both outwards and inwards, whereas German cargo liners do not as a rule call at United Kingdom ports. The action proposed would thus affect the earnings of the former ships to a certain extent, especially in respect to deliveries to German ports. It is doubtful whether they really get much outward German cargo. The main reasons for the Continental calls are to maintain established services.61. The extent to which British overseas cargo liners will benefit by the restricted operations of German shipping will depend largely on the proportion of German export trade in manufactures which will be secured by this country as British ships would then carry not only the additional exports, but the resulting additional raw materials required in the United Kingdom.62. In addition to the above it is reasonable to assume that a proportion of Germany&apos;s exports of such goods as coal, machinery, chemicals, sugar, &amp;c, would be secured by the United Kingdom, thus providing additional employment for British coastal trade ships and tramps.The Immediate Effect on United Kingdom Coal Trade.63. The embargo on United Kingdom exports of coal and coke to Germany would result in an immediate loss to the United Kingdom of about 225,000 tons a month, or over 2,750,000 tons a year.64. As regards other markets we might expect to gain part only of the supplies to France and Belgium since some of the demand would be met by additional home production. In Italy we might hope to replace the German coal almost entirely by British coal.On these assumptions the gains on these countries can be estimated at Tons.France      ... ... ... ...      2,750,000Belgium    ... ... ... ...      1,500,000Italy        ... ....... ...      1,250,0005,500,000Less loss in Germany    ... ...      2,750,000Net gain ... ... ...      2,750,000It must, however, be remembered that Germany will certainly attack us by a price-cutting campaign in every open market and we must expect to lose immediately, both in quantity and price, more than the net gain shown above.Possible Permanent Effect on United Kingdom Coal Trade.65. It is not inconceivable that when the economic pressure was withdrawn Germany might refuse to resume the Coal Agreement at present in force, and might even go so far as to take steps to prohibit imports for bunkers for use in the free harbours. In this event we would stand to lose at least 180,000 tons a month, or, in the extreme case, 225,000 tons per month.66.   It has to be remembered also, that even if trade with Germany in coal were resumed, while Germany would almost certainly be able to continue to [9192] c 2
displace us in neutral markets, we should, with equal certainty, find the utmost difficulty in selling coal in Germany, and our loss would be permanent.Financial Effects.67. Germany owes the City of London on short-term, in respect of acceptance and other credits, a sum of between  40 and  50 million.These are covered by the Standstill Agreement, and so long as this is in being interest is regularly paid and the bills constitute good assets in the hands of the holders. The imposition of economic pressure would inevitably bring the Standstill Agreement to an end, and interest would cease to be paid. The financial houses concerned would remain liable for the bills, and, in view of the doubtful prospect of ultimately recovering funds from Germany, would be imminently threatened with insolvency.68. Such a state of affairs would, undoubtedly, entail a financial crisis of the first magnitude unless special steps were taken to assist the financial houses concerned.69. There is also a considerable amount of short-term debts not covered by the Standstill Agreement, which would become irrecoverable (amount  15 to  20 million).In addition, the United Kingdom is a very large holder of long-term German bonds (amount uncertain, possibly  80 million nominal).70. Finally, the United Kingdom is interested to a substantial degree in manufacture and distribution within Germany. For example,, the British oil companies handle about 30 per cent, of the oil trade in Germany, and the financial loss to the United Kingdom caused by economic pressure would, therefore, be serious.IX. Possible Action by the League.71. Our Report has hitherto proceeded on the basis that the exercise of economic pressure upon Germany is confined to a limited number of Powers particularly interested in preventing German rearmament. We indicated, however, in paragraph 7 that, in the event of the circumstances of Germany&apos;s rearmament being such as to be generally regarded as constituting a threat to the peace of the world;&apos; there might be a possibility of action by a larger number of Powers as the result of the operation of the peace-preserving machinery of the League of Nations. The situation contemplated is that the Council or the Assembly, acting under Article 11, Article 13 (4) or Article 15 (4) of the Covenant, recommends to the Members of the League the use of economic pressure as a means of terminating the threat to the peace of the world. The possibility of such action has been suggested in discussions in the past at Geneva, particularly in connection with Article 11. It involves (a) a unanimous recom-mendation to that effect by the Council; (b) the acceptance of the recommendation by all the Members of the League, or at any rate a sufficient number to enable the action in question to be taken effectively. These possibilities are obviously of a speculative character, and much would turn on the circumstances as they presented themselves and the view of Germany&apos;s action which was taken by world opinion.72. In order not to confuse the issue, we have purposely refrained from a detailed consideration of the question from this angle. If it is considered necessary to examine this aspect of the question, we suggest that it should form the subject of a separate Report.
X-SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.(a) We have confined our investigation to a situation where only a certain number of Powers directly interested to prevent Germany rearming would be participating (paragraph 6).(b) In these circumstances, the pressure which could be exercised by the Participating Powers would be confined to (i) refusal to allow importation of German goods and exportation of goods to Germany;(ii) refusal to persons within their jurisdiction to have financial or commercial relations with Germany;(iii) refusal to ships flying their flag to trade to German ports or carryGerman goods;(iv) closing of their ports to German ships.This would entail diplomatic negotiations between the Participating Powers, followed, so far as this country is concerned, by legislation on the lines of the Trading with the Enemy Acts, and presumably by some legislative procedure in most, at any rate, of the other countries concerned (paragraph 8).(c) We have assumed that, of the Powers particularly concerned in preventing Germany&apos;s rearmament (i) The only ones which can be initially counted on to participate would be the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Poland and the Little Entente (paragraph 9 (1));(ii) of the other Powers whose participation would be important to success,we have proceeded on the assumption that the British Dominions, the United States and Italy would participate (paragraph 9 (2) (a)).(d) Of the remaining Powers (i) We have assumed that Russia would not participate (paragraph 9 (2) (6))-(ii) We have proceeded on the assumption that the Argentine would not participate, and that her example would be followed by other Central and Southern American States, whether parties to the Treaty of 1 Versaillelfor not (paragraph 9 (2) (b)). (iii) We have assumed that neighbours of Germany who are not parties to the Treaty of Versailles would not participate, for fear of German aggression or retaliation (paragraph 9 (2) (c)).(e) (i) Germany could take advantage of the preceding interval while the League machinery for the settlement of the dispute was functioning to accumulate reserves (paragraphs 10 and 40);(ii) We anticipate that, even when economic pressure was in operation, a re-export trade would very soon spring up in non-participating countries which it would be quite impossible to stop, and would, to a considerable extent, circumvent the action taken by the participating Powers (paragraph 40).(/) Quite apart from the nations which refuse to participate, we entertain grave doubts as to whether the nations pledged to apply economic pressure could be&quot; relied upon to make it effective (paragraph 41).
(g) We consider it highly problematical whether, even with the participation of the Powers mentioned under (c), it would be possible to exert economic pressure on Germany which would be effective (paragraphs 28, 40-42).(h) The nations of the British Commonwealth, including the Dominions, would be among the first to feel the reactions of economic pressure on Germany. This effect would be immediate, severe and possibly lasting. In particular the exercise of economic pressure on Germany would involve grave financial consequences in this country (paragraphs 43-70).(i) We have considered and rejected the idea of a &quot; Pacific blockade &quot; (paragraphs 12 and 13).(j) We desire to draw attention to a possible alternative situation where Germany&apos;s rearmament might be regarded as constituting a threat to the peace of the world, and the Council or Assembly of the League might recommend the use of economic pressure as a means of terminating this threat. We suggest that, should it be considered necessary to examine this aspect of the question, it should form the subject of a separate report (paragraphs 71 and 72).(Signed)WALTER E.

APPENDIX.Memorandum on the Circumstances in which Measures can be taken to compel. Observance by Germany of her Obligations under Part V (Military, Naval, and Air Clauses) of the Treaty of Versailles.THE concluding paragraphs of the memorandum respecting the organisation of the German police auxiliaries enclosed in the French Ambassador&apos;s communica-tion of the 5th May, 1933 (Annex I), state that &quot; If the Reich were not soon to take the measures necessary to re-establish a normal situation as regards the police, the Government of the Republic would be unable to admit the continuance of a state of affairs clearly contrary to the obligations contracted by Germany, and from which she is not entitled to free herself by unilateral action. The Government of the Republic sincerely hopes that were such a situation to arise, the British Government would be ready to concert with it on the measures necessary to put an end to a definite infraction of the treaty, and of the subsequent agreements which laid down the manner in which the treaty should be applied.&quot; These passages in the French memorandum must be read in conjunction with the state-ment in M. Paul-Boncour&apos;s speech in the Senate on the 4th May, 1933, in which he said that &quot; If Germany does not abandon these organisations (i.e., the illegal associations, auxiliary police, &amp;c), then the Treaty of Versailles must be applied.&quot; The obligations assumed by Germany in respect of her police force are set forth in a separate Memorandum. The &quot;illegal associations&quot; mentioned by M. Paul-Boncour are, of course, no new phenomenon. They have been a problem ever since the Allied Governments started to enforce the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. Another memorandum shows how the problem has been dealt with and to what degree the taint of illegality attaches to them.2. But it must not be lightly assumed that if the German Government in the near future is to be summoned to apply the Treaty of Versailles, it will merely be because of illegal measures it has recently adopted in regard to the police and the associations. If this was the sum total of Germany&apos;s offences. His Majesty&apos;s Government and, indeed, the Members of the League Council might hesitate to force matters to an issue; but the attitude of the German Government has recently shown itself so aggressive that it is necessary to take into account the possibilitj&apos; of Germany deciding to rearm on a large scale, either clandestinely or as an open act of defiance. It is in the anticipatory light of this possibility that the present Memorandum should be read, and not merely in the light of the German Govern-menfs recent tinkerings with the police and the &quot; illegal associations.&quot; Also, for the purpose of this Memorandum it is assumed that Germany does not accompany a violation of her disarmament obligations with an unprovoked recourse to war; if she were to do so, the legal position would be simple.3. In considering what &quot; measures &quot; could be taken &quot; to put an end to a definite infraction of the Treaty,&quot; and what is meant by &quot; applying &quot; the Treaty of Versailles in a case in which the Treaty has been violated, it is necessary to consider the question of rights and obligations under two aspects : (a) The Treaty of Versailles (including for this purpose the subsequent disarmament arrange-ments made between the ex-Allied Governments and the German Government); and (b) the Treaties of Locarno, the Covenant and the Pact of Paris. It may be stated at once that Part XIV (guarantees) of the Treaty of Versailles cannot be employed. As the evacuation of the Rhineland has been completed before the expiry of the period laid down by the Treaty, the ex-Allies cannot make use of the provision in Article 429 which enabled the evacuation to be delayed in the event ^of the guarantees against unprovoked aggression by Germany not being con-sidered sufficient. Part XIV does not provide for re-occupation of the Rhineland save in the event of non-compliance by Germany with her reparation
obligations; and the &apos;&apos; International Agreement on the Evacuation of the Rhine-land Territory&quot; of the 30th August, 1929 (Cmd. 34.17), contains no provision or reservation respecting re-occupation.4.   Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles provides that :  &quot; So long as the present Treaty remains in force, Germany undertakes to give every facility for any investigation which the Council of the League of Nations, acting if need be by a majority vote, may consider necessary.&quot;If then any of the ex-Allies considers that the Treaty of Versailles or some subsequent agreement or decision taken under it has been violated by Germany in the matter of some provision of Part V (Military, Naval and Air Clauses), the first step is, presumably (unless the facts are notorious or undisputed), a demand for an investigation under Article 213. In 1924 and 1925, the Council of the League approved rules for the conduct of an enquiry of this nature; and on the 11th December, 1926, the Council adopted a report (Annex II) which elucidated these rules.(&apos;) According to this report, &quot; The Council of the League of Nations, acting by a majority vote, shall decide in conformity with Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles whether it is necessary to hold an investigation, and it shall then specify the object and the limits of such investigation. The Commission of Investigation shall act under the Treaty and on the instructions of the Council; the Council&apos;s decisions shall be taken by a majority vote.....To render an effective investigation possible, the Commission shall apply to the German Government, who will procure without delay the assistance of the competent authority.&quot;5. The powers possessed by the Council of the League under Article 213 are powers of investigation only, i.e., enquiry into and determination of the facts. If the result of the investigation is to establish facts which any of the ex-Allies considers to constitute a violation by Germany of an engagement into which she entered under the Treaty of Versailles, there arises between the ex-Ally concerned and Germany a dispute. The League (see Sir Cecil Hurst&apos;s minute of the 27th January, 1925 : Annex III) is not a party to this dispute. But, whilst its role (see Sir C. Hurst&apos;s minute), &quot; under Article 213 will have been fulfilled by its enquiry into and determination of facts, its role under the terms of the Covenant as an organisation for endeavouring to bring the disputants to a harmonious conclusion of their quarrel will begin.&quot; A refusal by Germany to admit an investigation would amount to a breach of Article 213 and would in itself produce a dispute.6. It is essential that any such dispute should not be handled in such a way as to expose the ex-Allies to the possibility of sanctions resulting from a breach of their own international obligations, and it is therefore necessary to consider carefully the treaty provisions applicable to such a dispute. Even when the coercive measures in contemplation do not involve the use of force, it will still be necessary that they should not be applied until the whole of the pi&apos;ocedure provided for in the Covenant and the Treaties of Locarno as set forth in the following paragraphs has been exhausted.7. It will be convenient, in the first instance, to assume that the dispute is between France (or Belgium, whose treaty position is identical with that of France) and Germany. Article 3 of the main Locarno Treaty and the Locarno Arbitration Convention between Germany and France (Cmd. 2525) provide for the settlement by peaceful means of &quot;all questions of every kind which may arise between them and which it may not be(*) In the one case where a violation of the military clauses of the Treaties of Peace was referred to the Council of the League of Nations, the latter, for reasons which need not be discussed here, decided not to use the machinery established by the above decisions, but to deal with the matter by means of an ad hoc committee drawn from the Secretariat (for details, see Annex to Memorandum on Disarmament of ex-Enemy Countries, 13609, Confidential).      . .
possible to settle by the normal methods of diplomacy. &quot;(2) Under these treaties disputes &quot; with regard to which the parties are in conflict as to their respective rights &quot; (i.e., disputes of a legal character) are, except in cases where a special procedure is laid down in other conventions, to go to an arbitral tribunal or to the Permanent Court; the parties may, however, agree to submit the dispute to the Permanent Conciliation Commission set up under the Franco-German Convention, in which case the dispute only goes to an arbitral, tribunal or the Permanent Court if the conciliation procedure fails. All other disputes go to the Permanent Conciliation Commission, and, if this procedure fails to produce a settlement, to the Council of the League, which is to deal with them under Article 15 of the Covenant. If Germany refuses to submit the dispute to peaceful settlement, France must, under the last paragraph of Article 5 of the main Locarno Treaty, bring the matter before the Council, which will propose what steps should be taken; the parties to the Treaty &quot;shall comply with these proposals.&quot;8. In the circumstances contemplated Germany may dispute the existence of the facts alleged to constitute a breach of her disarmament obligations, or contend that they do not constitute a violation of those obligations, or raise some legal defence, such as that the failure of the ex-Allies to disarm has released her from those obligations. In any one of these events the dispute would be of a legal character and should be referred to an arbitral tribunal or to the Permanent Court. It would seem that only in the event of Germany admitting without seeking to excuse a violation of her disarmament obligations would the dispute be one for the alternative procedure of conciliation, followed, if necessary, by a reference to the Council.9. If the case goes to judicial decision, and if either the decision is in favour of Germany or Germany complies with it, the dispute is settled. If Germany refuses to comply with a judicial decision given against her, the last paragraph of Article 5 of the main Treaty of Locarno applies and France has to bring the matter before the Council of the League; the Council is to propose what steps are to be taken and all the parties to the Treaty are to comply with those proposals. It follows from this that (1) if Germany refused to comply with the Council&apos;s proposals she would be committing another breach of her treaty obligations, (2) if the Council made proposals for enforcing the judicial decision, the other parties to Locarno would be bound to carry out those proposals.(3) The position and-powers of the Council under these Locarno provisions are the same as under Article 13 (4) of the Covenant; but the effect of the provisions in question is to give to the Council&apos;s proposals greater force than they possess under the Covenant. It may probably be assumed that, for the purpose of making such proposals, the Council must be unanimous, not counting the parties to the dispute; the question of the nature of the proposals which the Council might make will be considered later.10. If the dispute is of a non-legal character and is accordingly submitted to a procedure of conciliation, either party can, if agreement has not been reached within a month from the termination of the labours of the Permanent Conciliation Commission, bring the dispute before the Council, which is to deal with it under Article 15 of the Covenant (Article 18 of the Franco-German Locarno Arbitration Convention). If the Council succeeds in effecting a settlement of the dispute, the matter will be disposed of, and the Council is to make a public statement about the dispute and the terms of settlement (Article 1.5, paragraph 3). If no settle-ment is reached, the Council &quot; either unanimously or by a majority vote shall make and publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are deemed just and proper in regard thereto &quot; (Article 15, paragraph 4).  If this report by the Council is unanimous except for(2) This obligation is. reinforced by (a) Article 12 of the Covenant and (b) Article 2 of the Pact of Paris (Omd. 3410), by which Germany and France have agreed that &quot; the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts, of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise between them shall never be sought except by pacific means.&quot;(3) This also applies to the case where Germany refuses to submit the dispute to peaceful settlement see last sentence of paragraph 7 above.[9192] i)
one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League agree that they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which complies with the recommendations of the report (Article 15, paragraph 6). If no such unanimous report is reached, the Members of the League can &quot; take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice &quot; (Article 15, paragraph 7).11. At this point it will be convenient to consider the hypothesis of the dispute being between the United Kingdom and Germany. In that case the Locarno Arbitration Conventions would not be applicable, but since the dispute would presumably be one &quot; likely to lead to a rupture,&quot; Article 12 of the Covenant would apply, and the dispute would have to be submitted either to judicial settlement (which could be done under the Optional Clause) or to the Council. In the event of a submission to judicial settlement, the position would be the same as that indicated in paragraph 9 above in the case of a Franco-German dispute, except that the last paragraph of Article 5 of the main Locarno Treaty would not be applicable, with the result that (i) the Council would have no specific power to make proposals in the event of Germany refusing to submit the case to judicial decision (though it could deal with the situation under its ordinary powers); (ii) in the event of Germany refusing to carry out a judicial decision, while the Council could (under Article 13 (4) of the Covenant) propose steps to be taken to give effect to the decision, there would be no obligation on the parties to the Locarno Treaty to comply with those proposals. In the event of the dispute being of a non -legal character and being referred to the Council, (&apos;) the position would be precisely the same as in the case of a Franco-German dispute, which had been referred to the Council after a failure of the conciliation procedure.12. It will be seen, therefore, that a situation may arise in which (1) the &apos;Council(5) might, under the last paragraph of Article 5 of the main Locarno Treaty, propose steps to deal with a refusal by Germany to submit a dispute to peaceful settlement; (2) in the case of a dispute of a legal character the Council(5) might, under the last paragraph of Article 5 of the main Locarno Treaty and Article 13 (4) of the Covenant, propose steps to give effect to a judicial decision with which Germany refused to comply; (3) in the case of a non-legal dispute, the Council(5) might (under Article 15) make recommendations involving steps to be taken against Germany with the object of putting an end to her violation of her disarmament obligations; (4) in a non-legal dispute where the Council had failed to make a unanimous report, the ex-Allies concerned would be entitled (under Article 15 (7)) to take such action as they might consider necessary with that object. In so far as action taken under any of these headings consisted of measures like economic pressure which did not involve the use of force, no difficulties resulting from treat)1- obligations not to resort to force would arise, and the important questions which would present themselves as to the possibility and probable effect of such measures, and the position in relation thereto of States not parties to the dispute, are not within the scope of this memorandum. But in relation to forcible measures involving the invasion or occupation of German territory, while in the circumstances postulated no question of their compatibility with the Covenant would arise, it is necessary to take into account the provisions of Article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno and of the Pact of Paris.13. Under Article 2 of the main Locarno Treaty, Germany and Belgium and Germany and France mutually undertake that they will in no case attack or invade each other or resort to war against each other. This provision does not, however, apply (with other exceptions not now relevant) to &quot; action as the result of a decision taken by the Assembly or by the Council of the League of Nations or in pursuance of Article 15, paragraph 7, of the Covenant of the League of Nations, provided that in this last event the action is directed against a State(&apos;) His Majesty&apos;s Government eould if they liked refer the dispute to the Assembly instead of the Council, which France could not do under Article 18 of the Locarno Arbitration Convention. For the sake of simplicity this possibility is disregarded in the present memorandum.(*) This means the Council acting unanimously, the votes of the parties to the dispute not being counted.
which was the first to attack.&quot; It follows that an invasion or occupation of German territory would be permissible only in the following cases :- -(1) Where Germany had refused to-submit the dispute to peaceful settlement or to comply with an arbitral or judicial decision, and where the Council had unanimously, the votes of the parties to the dispute not being counted, decided (under Article 5, last paragraph, of Locarno) to propose such an invasion or occupation;(2) In the case of a non-legal dispute which had been submitted to the Council&apos; under Article 15, where the Council had unanimously, the votes of the parties to the dispute not being counted, agreed to a report recommending such an invasion or occupation.14. It may, peivhaps, be contended that in the latter case the invasion or occupation would be permissible if recommended only by a majority of the Council under Article 15 (4). This argument does not, however, appear sound; in the case of a majority report under paragraph 4, paragraph 7 applies, under which &quot; the Members of the League may take such action as they consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice,&quot; but under &quot;Article 2, paragraph 3, of Locarno the invasion of German territory is only permissible in a case falling under Article 15 (7) if such action &quot; is directed against a State which was the first to attack.&quot;15. It should be added that the provision in Article 12 (1), which forbids &quot;resort to war&quot; until three months after the Report by the Council, would presumably not be regarded as applicable to an occupation of German territory which had been recommended by the Council.16. The question arises whether there is in fact any possibility of the Council unanimously recommending action of this nature. All that can be said is that this would largely depend on the actual circumstances of the case and the attitude which the public opinion of the world adopted towards them. In the event of the Council failing to recommend action of this nature, or even of its failing to make any unanimous recommendations at all, measures such as economic pressure not involving the use of force would be permissible so far as the treaties discussed in this memorandum are concerned, though there may be other instruments, such as a commercial treaty with Germany, which might be inconsistent with such action.17. Article 2 of the main, Locarno Treaty does not apply to the United Kingdom, which is consequently not bound by the limitations resulting from that article on the power to attack or invade Germany (see paragraph 14). Assuming that the necessary procedure for the peaceful settlement of the dispute had been adopted (see paragraph 12 above), it is only the provisions of the Pact of Paris which His Majesty&apos;s Government have to take into account in relation to the invasion or occupation of German territory.18. As regards the Pact of Paris, the correspondence which preceded its signature (see Annex IV) makes it sufficiently plain that the Pact does not forbid war in cases where it is undertaken in pursuance of the provisions of the Treaty of Locarno, and, if so, it could not forbid military measures such as the invasion or occupation of German territory in cases where such action were taken in virtue of that treaty. Action of this nature, if taken in pursuance of a unanimous recommendation by the Council in one of the cases (1), (2) or (3) set out in paragraph 12 above, could not be regarded as a recourse to war &apos;&apos; as an instrument of national policy.&quot; But invasion of German territory carried out merely on the strength of a majority recommendation of the Council (and consequently under Article 15 (7) of the Covenant) would probably be held to constitute a violation of the Pact of Paris. The proposed Declaration not to Resort to Force which is at present before the Disarmament Conference, and Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s similar proposal of the 16th May, must be disregarded since it is not at present known whether or in what form either of them will be adopted, but it is probably safe to assume that they would not exclude action of the nature contemplated in cases where it would be permissible under the Pact of Paris and the Treaty of Locarno.19.   One form of forcible action against Germany which has not so far been considered is a &apos;&apos; pacific blockade &apos;&apos; (without declaration of war) of the German [9192] d 2
coast. Such action does not appear to be covered by the prohibition in Article 2 of the main Locarno Treaty to attack or invade Germany. Action of this nature might conceivably be recommended by the Council in the circumstances dealt with in paragraph 12 above, but, apart from any questions as to its practicability and effect, the position of States not parties to the dispute would obviously cause difficulties which are not within the scope of this memorandum.20. In the special case of a violation by Germany of the provisions relating to the Rhineland demilitarized zone (Articles 42-44 of the Treaty of Versailles), the procedure of conciliation provided by the Locarno Arbitration Conventions can be applied, in accordance with the International Agreement on the Evacua-tion of the Rhineland Territory (Cmd. 3417). It is, however, also possible to employ the jmocedure laid down in Article 4 of the main Locarno Treaty, under which an alleged violation of the provisions in question is brought before the Council. If satisfied that such violation has been committed, the Council will notify its finding to the other Locarno Powers, who are then to come immediately to the assistance of the complaining Power. It will be noticed that the processes which have to be gone through before sanctions can be applied to Germany in the event of her infringing Part V of the Treaty are so curtailed in the case of her violating Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty, that it is possible for the Locarno Powers in the latter case to proceed at once to the invasion or occupation of German territory as soon as the Council is satisfied^) that a violation has been committed. The reason for this distinction is that, whereas an infraction of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles merely constitutes a dispute between Germany and the other signatories of the Treaty, an infraction of Articles 42 and 43 is, according to Article 44, to be regarded as the commission of a hostile act against the other signatory Powers, and, as such, is tantamount to a resort of war in the sense of Article 16 of the Covenant.21. In conclusion, it may be convenient to indicate the position of Germany&apos;s eastern neighbours Poland and Czechoslovakia. These countries concluded at Locarno arbitration treaties with Germany which are practically identical with the Franco-German and Belgo-German treaties, and consequently the position of Poland and Czechoslovakia as regards the procedure to be adopted for dealing with a dispute arising out of a violation by Germany of her disarmament obligations is identical with that described in regard to France and Belgium in paragraphs 7-10 above. Poland and Czechoslovakia are not parties to the main Locarno Treaty and are consequently not bound by the undertaking not to attack or invade Germany; their position in this respect is identical with that of the United Kingdom (paragraph 16 above) in that the Pact of Paris is the only treaty obligation which they have to take into account.22.   The above considerations seem to lead to the following conclusions : (i) In the event of a violation by Germany of her disarmament obligations,it is essential that the complaining Powers should proceed in strict accordance with their obligations under the Covenant and the Treaty of Locarno, even if the coercive measures contemplated do not involve the use of force;(ii) Normally the first step would be a request to the Council of the Leagueof Nations to carry out an investigation under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles;(iii) If the result of the investigation is to establish facts regarded as constituting a violation of Germany&apos;s obligations, the resulting dispute must, if between Germany and France or Germany and Belgium, be submitted, according to its nature, either to judicial settlement or to conciliation followed, if necessary, by reference to the League under Article 15. If between Germany and the United Kingdom, it must go either to the Permanent Court or to the Council;(iv) In the event of Germany refusing to submit the dispute to judicialsettlement or to comply with an arbitral or judicial decision, the matter must be brought before the Council under the last paragraph of Article 5 of Locarno;(6) The Council can satisfy itself on this point either by an ad hoc enquiry, or by using the method of investigation which has been created for implementing Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles.
Foreign Office, May 30, 1933.(v) The invasion or occupation of German territory would (subject to paragraph (vi)) be permissible if, but only if, the Council acting unanimously (the votes of the parties to the dispute not being counted) recommended such action under Article 5, last paragraph of Locarno or Article 15 (4) of the Covenant;(vi) In the case of a sufficiently serious violation of Articles 42 or 43 of theTreaty of Versailles, a shorter procedure can be employed, and the invasion or occupation of German territory would be permissible as soon as the Council had satisfied itself that such a violation existed;(vii) Subject to any difficulties arising from instruments like commercial treaties, measures such as economic pressure not involving the use of force would be permissible (whether or not the Council had made a unanimous recommendation to that effect) assuming that the procedure prescribed for the settlement of the dispute had been adopted. The same is probably the case as regards a &apos;&apos; pacific blockade &apos;&apos; of German ports. The practicability and possible effects of such measures are not within the scope of this memorandum.

La note de lAmbassade d Allemagne du 23 octobre rappelle, en effet, que 1&apos;in execution des demandes des allies empeche ceux-ci de consideier comme accomplies les obligations imposees a 1&apos;Allemagne par le traite; elle ajoute que le Gouvernement allemand est a meme de faire savoir a la Conference des Ambassadeurs qu&apos;un nombre considerable des demandes enumerees a la Partie III de TAnnexe I a la note collective sont executees et dans une liste des &quot; demandes executees &quot; est indiquee sous le chiffre 1, comme le rappelle d&apos;ailleurs le Gouvernement britannique dans le deuxieme paragraphe de. sa note : &apos;&apos; Police; suppression des corps de police auxiliaire et des volontaires.&quot;L &quot;organisation d&apos;une police auxiliaire en Allemagne n&apos;est done pas seule-ment, aux yeux du Gouvernement frangais, la violation d&apos;une decision reguliere-ment prise en vertu du traite, mais d&apos;un accord intervenu entre les Gouverne-ments allies et le Gouvernement allemand pour 1&apos;execution de ce meme traite.Cet accord s&apos;est d&apos;ailieurs trouve confirme par un echange de lettres des 21 et 23 decembre 1926 entre la Conference des Ambassadeurs et VAmbassade dAllemagne a Paris.    Dans sa lettre du 23 decembre, M. von Hoesch faisaitList of Annexes to Appendix.
savoir explicitement que son Gouvernement se declarait &quot; d&apos;accord avec la fixation des effectifs de police en Allemagne &quot; precisee dans la lettre de la conference du 21 decembre et &quot; sous les conditions y mentionnees.&quot;Au cours d&apos;une demarche effectuee le 6 avril dernier par 1&apos;Ambassadeur de la Republique a Berlin pour demander au Gouvernement du Reich ce qu&apos;il comptait faire pour mettre fin a un etat de choses contraire aux traites et accords en vigueur, M. von Neurath n&apos;a pas conteste les arguments juridiques qui lui ont ete exposes et s&apos;est borne, pour justifier les mesures prises par M. Goering, a d&apos;invoquer la situation particulierement troublee que traversait 1&apos;Allemagne.3. Le Gouvernement britannique n&apos;estime pas, d&apos;autre part, disposer de preuves suffisantes pour lui permettre de soutenir que les effectifs et les armements de forces de police auxiliaire depassent les chiffres autorises.A cet egard, le Gouvernement francais croit devoir noter tout d&apos;abord qu&apos;aux termes memes de 1&apos;arrete de M. Goering, la police auxiliaire vient non pas se substituer a la police existante, mais la renforcer. II est logique de penser que ses effectifs et ses armements s&apos;ajoutent done aux effectifs et aux armements deja existants. D&apos;autre part, le Ministre allemand des Affaires etrangeres, dans sa conversation du 6 avril avec 1&apos;Ambassadeur de France a Berlin, a admis que le Commissaire prussien avait autorise pour la Prusse un recrutement allant jusqu&apos;a 50,000 hommes, c&apos;est-a-dire le doublement des effectifs reguliers. M. von Neurath a ajoute, il est vrai, que le chiffre de 25,000 recrues n&apos;avait pas ete depasse et que les nouveaux policiers n&apos;etaient armes de fusil qu&apos;avec 1&apos;obligation, leur service accompli, de les laisser dans les casernes. Cependant, 1&apos;augmentation des effectifs et des armements de la police dans une mesure considerable n&apos;est, dans ces conditions, plus contestable.4. Pour ce qui touche a la zone demilitarisee, le Gouvernement britannique ne pense pas disposer d&apos;une documentation suffisante pour prouver que les effectifs de police dans la zone rhenane depassent de plus de 200 hommes les chiffres con-venus et qu&apos;il y ait, en consequence, manquement de la part du Reich aux engage-ments pris par lui dans 1&apos;echange de lettres des 18 et 19 Janvier 1930 entre la Conference des Ambassadeurs et 1&apos;Ambassade d&apos;Allemagne a Paris.Le Gouvernement francais recommit volontiers qu&apos;il n&apos;*a sur les effectifs de police en zone deinilitarisee que des indications fragmentaires. Files etablissent cependant que ces effectifs s&apos;elevaient fin mars a environ 3,000 hommes de plus que le total fixe par les accords germano-allies. Au surplus, les declarations de M. von Neurath a 1&apos;Ambassadeur de France a Berlin ne permettent pas de douter que les effectifs reguliei&apos;s de la police ne soient depasses en Prusse rhenane comme dans le reste du Reich.5. Tout en se defendant de vouloir admettre un manquement a une decision prise en execution du traite, le Gouvernement britannique note pour conclure qu&apos;il serait facheux a 1&apos;heure presente de poursuivre avec 1&apos;Allemagne une discus-sion irritante sur la question de la police auxiliaire, alors que cette question pourrait recevoir une solution dans le cadre des decisions que la Conference du Desarmement va etre amenee a prendre.Le Gouvernement de la Republique veut, comme le Gouvernement britannique, esperer que les debats de Geneve permettront de resoudre, pour 1&apos;avenir, la question des polices allemandes. II ne se dissimule pas qu&apos;une demarche entreprise auprks du Conseil de la Societe des Nations, sans attendre Tissue des discussions en cours a la Conference du Desarmement, serait susceptible de compliquer encore une situation d ja delicate; il a pris note enfin de 1&apos;assurance donnee par M. von Neurath a 1&apos;Ambassadeur de France a Berlin que 1&apos;intention de son Gouvernement n&apos;etait pas de proceMer a un reinforcement durable de la police rdguliere. Dans ces circonstances, le Gouvernement de la Republique se trouve d&apos;accord avec le Gouvernement britannique pour reconnaitre qu&apos;il est preferable de ne pas donner momentanefiient d&apos;autre suite a 1&apos;affaire.Si, toutefois, les espoirs communs des deux Gouvernements devaient. etre decus et si le Reich ne prenait pas a bref delai les mesures necessaires pour retablir, en ce qui concerne la police des divers &quot; pays,&quot; une situation normale, le Gouvernement de la R6publique ne pourrait pas accepter que persistat un state de choses manifestement contraire aux obligations que 1&apos;Allemagne a contractees et dont il ne lui appartient pas de se d^gager par sa seule volonte. II ne saurait, en effet, rester indifferent a des manquements au traite, dont certains peuvent etre d&apos;importance secondaire, mais qui, en se multipliant, acquierent, par leur nombre meme, un caractere sur lequel il n&apos;est pas permis de se m^prendre.
Dans ce domaine, toute tolerance injustifiee risque d&apos;etre interpreted comme un encouragement a des initiatives plus graves encore. Les termes de la communi-cation adressee a 1&apos;Ambassadeur de France donnent au Gouvernement de la Republique le ferme espoir que, dans la situation ainsi envisagee, le Gouverne-ment britannique serait pret a se concerter avec lui sur la methode a employer pour mettre fin a un manquement caracterise au traite et aux accords subsequents qui en ont fixe 1&apos;application.Annex II to Appendix.League of Nations. Communicated to the Council. C. 724 (1), 1926, IX.Execution of the Military, Naval and Air Clauses of the Treaties of Peace.Report by M. Benes.Adopted by the Council on December 11, 1926.Geneva, December 11, 1926. ON this occasion and in reply to certain questions submitted by the German Government regarding the regulations adopted by the Council on the 27th September, 1924, and the 14th March, 1925, I propose that the Council should give the following explanations : 1. The Council of the League of Nations, acting by a majority vote, shall decide in conformity with Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, whether it is necessary, in any particular case, to hold an investigation, and it shall then specify the object and the limits of such investigation. The Commissions of Investigation shall act under the authority and on the instructions of the Council; the Council&apos;s decisions shall be taken by a majority vote.2. To render an effective investigation possible, the Commission shall apply to the representative appointed by the German Government or to his delegates, who will procure without delay the assistance of the administrative, judicial or military authority competent under German law. Such investigation shall then be carried out and findings reached as the Commission, acting within the limits of its instructions, may consider advisable, the interested party being given a hearing (contradictoirement).3. The prohibition laid down that the nationals of a State subjected to the right of investigation shall not form part of commissions of investigation, shall be understood in the sense that the nationals of the State in the territory of which an investigation is undertaken, shall never form part of a Commission holding such investigation.4. It is understood that the provisions of Article 213 of the Peace Treaty with Germany, relating to investigations, shall be applicable to the demilitarised Rhine zone as to other parts of Germany. These provisions do not provide in this zone, any more than elsewhere, for any special control by local standing and permanent groups. In the demilitarised Rhine zone such special groups, not provided for in Article 213, shall not be set up except by convention between the Governments concerned.5. The explanations given in Articles 1, 2 and 3 above naturally apply to cases under Articles 159 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, Article 143 of the Treaty of Trianon, and Article 104 of the Treaty of Neuilly.
Annex III to Appendix.Extract from an Opinion by Sir C. Hurst on the Powers of the League of Nations under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles (embodied in a Foreign Office Letter to War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry of January 27, 1925).NO provision in the Treaty of Versailles, Part V, or in the Covenant of the League of Nations, confers any general power upon the League or upon the Council of the League to enforce the provisions of treaties in general or of the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles in particular. What Article 213 does is to confer upon the Council of the League the power to hold investigations, i.e., to enquire into and determine the facts.The military, naval and air clauses of the Treaty of Versailles providing for the disarmament of Germany fall into two groups : (a) Those which impose a transitory obligation upon Germany which she was bound to fulfil within a limited period, and (b) those which impose upon her permanent obligations, such as the provision relating to the construction or acquisition of submarines or that relating to compulsory military service. Special organisations were set up to control the execution of the transitory clauses (see Article 203), and for the permanent clauses the League of Nations was given the right of investigation. This right of investigation is the sole function conferred upon the League in connexion with Part V (the military clauses).One of the great difficulties in the way of any scheme for the limitation of armaments is the difficulty of ensuring its observance, and the chief difficulty in the way of ensuring observance is the difficulty of getting at the truth. Presumably, therefore, it was considered by the framers of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles that if the League was given a power which would enable it to investigate the facts and get at the truth, the probability of Germany violating the disarmament clauses would be greatly minimised, if not entirely removed.The Treaty of Versailles has no status different from other treaties, and the League of Nations has not been given any general function or duty of enforcing the provisions of all treaties. The action which the Council can take on the report of a commission of investigation is thus very limited. Such a report will establish the fact whether or not a breach of the treaty has been committed. The type of decision which can then be taken by the Council is, for instance, to publish the report, or to communicate it to all the other members of the League, or to consider the question of strengthening the machinery for making further investigations in the future. The Council certainly has not the power of setting all the other members of the League in motion for the purpose of applying coercion to Germany merely because she has broken a treaty engagement.What, then, is the position where an investigation ordered by the Council under Article 213 results in the establishing of some violation by Germany of her treaty engagements under the military, naval or air clauses of the Treaty of Versailles % It is that Germany has violated the engagements which she has entered into with the other parties to the Treaty of Versailles. There would then arise between them, and Germany a dispute, but it is a dispute in which the League of Nations will not play the part of a party to the dispute. The role of the League will be that of endeavouring to prevent war and of bringing the parties to the dispute to an amicable solution. The parties to the dispute will be Germany on the one side, and one or more of the Allies on the other. The role of the League under Article 213 will have been fulfilled by its enquiry into and determination of facts, and its role under the articles of the Covenant as an organisation for endeavouring to bring the disputants to a harmonious conclusion of their quarrel will begin. The Council of the League will then act under Article 11 of the Covenant (which necessitates the concurrence of the parties to the dispute in any action thus taken, as well as unanimity of all other members of the League represented on the Council), or, under Article 15, which excludes the parties to the dispute from the calculation with regard to unanimity and provides also what is to happen if the non-parties to the dispute cannot arrive at a unanimous conclusion among themselves.[9192]E
Extracts from the correspondence respecting the United States proposal for the renunciation of war (Cmd. 3109 and 3153).THE exchange of correspondence which preceded the signature of the Kellogg Pact contains certain passages in which the French, German, British and United States Governments define their conception of the relation of the Pact to the Covenant of the League of Nations and incidentally to the Locarno Treaty.On the 26th March, 1928, the French Ambassador in Washington informed the United States Government that &quot;if it is clearly understood in a general way that the obligations of the new pact should not be substituted for, or prejudice in any way, previous obligations contained in international instruments such as the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Locarno agreements or treaties guaranteeing neutrality whose character and scope cannot be modified thereby, then the differences of opinion which have appeared in the course of previous phases of the negotiation have to do more with words than with the reality of the problem facing the two Governments to-day.On the 27th April, 1928, the German Government informed the United States Ambassador in Berlin that &quot; In so far as Germany is concerned the only international agreements which need be considered as liable to be affected by the provisions of the new pact are the Covenant of the League and the Locarno-Rhineland Pact; Germany had not entered into any other international engagements which could be affected by the new proposal. In the view of the German Government the observance of the obligations devolving under the Covenant of the League and the Rhineland Pact must remain immovably fixed. The German Government are, however, convinced that these obligations do not contain anything which could in any way conflict with the obligations fore-shadowed in the draft pact of the United States. On the contrary, the German Government consider that the binding obligation not to resort to war as an instrument of national policy can only tend to strengthen the basic principles of the League Covenant and the Rhineland Pact.On the 19th May, 1928, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom informed the United States Ambassador in London that they &quot;appreciate the scruples which have prompted the suggestions by the French Government. The exact fulfilment of treaty engagements is a matter which affects the national honour;  precision  as to  the scope of such engagements is, therefore, ofimportance.....The preservation of peace has been the chief concern of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the prime object of all their endeavours. It is the reason why they have given ungrudging support to the League of Nations, and why they have undertaken the burden of the guarantee embodied in the Locarno Treaty. The sole object of all these engagements is the elimination of war as an instrument of national policy, just as it is the purpose of the peace pact now proposed. It is because the object of both is the same that there is no real antagonism between the treaty engagements which His Majesty&apos;s Government have already accepted and the pact which is now proposed. The machinery of the Covenant and of the Treaty of Locarno, however, go somewhat further than a renunciation of war as a policy, in that they provide certain sanctions for a breach of their obligations. A clash might thus conceivably arise between the existing treaties and the proposed pact, unless it is understood that the obligations of the new engagement will cease to operate in respect of a party which breaks its pledges and adopts hostile measures against one of its co-contractants. For the Government of this country respect for the obligations arising out of the Covenant of the League of Nations and out of the Locarno treaties is fundamental. Our position in this regard is identical with that of the German Government as indicated in their note of the 27th April. His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree to any new treaty which would weaken or undermine these engagements on which the peace of Europe rests. . . . Mr. Kellogg has made it clear in the speech to which I have drawn attention that he had no intention by the terms of the new treaty of preventing the parties to the Covenant of the League or to the Locarno Treaty from fulfilling their obligations.&quot; Further, in a note dated the 18th July, 1928, Sir Austen Chamberlain pointed out to the United StatesAnnex IV to Appendix.
oCharge d&apos;Affaires in London &quot; that respect for the obligations arising out of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of the Locarno treaties was the foundation of the policy of the Government of this country, and that they could not agree to any new treaty which would weaken or undermine these engagements. . . . His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain do not consider, after mature reflection, that the fulfilment of the obligations which they have undertaken in the Covenant of the League of Nations and in the Treaty of Locarno, is precluded by their acceptance of the proposed treaty. They concur in the view enunciated by the German Government in their note of the 27th April, that those obligations do not contain anything which could conflict with the treaty proposed by the United States Government.&quot;On the .23rd June, 1928, the United States Charge dAffaires in London informed His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom that &quot; The Covenant imposes no affirmative primary obligation to go to war. The obligation, if any, is secondary, and attaches only when deliberately accepted by a State. Article 10 of the Covenant has, for example, been interpreted by a resolution submitted to the Fourth Assembly, but not formally adopted owing to one adverse vote, to mean that : &apos; It is for the constitutional authorities of each member to decide, in reference to the obligation of preserving the independence and the integrity of the territory of the members, in what degree the member is bound to assure the execution of this obligation by employment of its military forces.&apos; There is, in my opinion, no necessary inconsistency between the Covenant and the idea of an unqualified renunciation of war. The Covenant can, it is true, be construed as authorising war in certain circumstances, but it is an authorisation and not a positive requirement.&quot;
