i I j -fJP^t^4-.fpr^he.Cfib^%et^.March 1934.SECRET.Copy No.  42CP. 76 (34)CABINET.MILK  LEGISLATION   AND   AMENDMENTS   OF   agricultural marketing ACTS.LEGISLATION will be necessary to give effect to the proposals with regard to milk approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 21st February (Cabinet 6 (34), Conclusion 6) and announced in the House of Commons on the 22nd February (Cmd. 4519).2. A Bill is in draft and will be submitted to the Home Affairs Committee on the 26th March, with a view to consideration by the Cabinet on the 28th March, and the placing of the Financial Resolution, if approved, on the Order Paper of the House of Commons, before the House rises for the Easter recess.3.   Provisions of the Bill are as follows : (a) Provisions to give effect to the arrangements for repayable advances tothe Milk Marketing Boards. These do not call for comment at this stage.(b) Provision of  750,000 from public funds for launching a campaign forsecuring a purer milk supply. I propose that this should be drafted in general terms, the detailed administrative arrangements being left to the Ministers concerned to determine, in the light of the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Economic Advisory Council under the Chairmanship of Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, which Report will, I hope, be available in the near future. In the meantime, inter-departmental discussions on these questions are actively proceeding.(c) Provision for the payment to the Milk Marketing Boards of theGovernment contribution to a milk publicity fund to put in operation an approved programme containing, inter alia, arrangements for the supply of milk to schools at reduced rates. It is proposed that this programme should be drawn up by the Milk Board through a small advisory committee. I have no. doubt that the Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales will wish me to issue the invitations to serve on this Committee, and the personnel is at present receiving careful consideration.4. I had hoped to have been able to have included in the above measure certain amendments of the Agricultural Marketing Acts, 1931-33, which will be of general application, but primarily necessary to enable the Sugar Marketing Scheme, which has now been submitted by the sugar industry, to come into effective operation. Included among these is an amendment to carry out the undertaking given in the agreed statement made in the House of Commons on the 27th July last, to support existing producers in their efforts to improve their industry in the public interest. This particular amendment may well prove to be essential in the event of any arrangements being concluded for the limitation of sugar production.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.[9802]
5. Among other necessary and pressing amendments will be one to enable agreements reached between English and Scottish marketing boards for the allocation of markets to be carried into effect, and also an amendment, which is desired both by the Forestry Commission and by the Central Landowners&apos; Association, to bring forest products within the scope of the Acts.6. I am informed, however, that the Speaker has ruled that it would not be proper to include in one general measure the &apos;&apos; money &apos;&apos; clauses relating to milk, and the &quot; non-money&quot; clauses amending the Marketing Acts, and I must therefore ask for authority to submit a separate Bill to give effect to the amendments of the Agricultural Marketing Acts referred to above. I should hope that this Bill might be introduced in the House of Lords. If it could be brought in before Easter it would be available for discussion in that House immediately after the recess.7. Both Bills are being prepared in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland and other Ministers concerned.(Initialled) W. E. E.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, March 16, 1934.
