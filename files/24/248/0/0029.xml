Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 93 (34).CABINET.INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT.IN this memorandum I desire to present to my colleagues a summary in the shortest possible form of the international commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government to protect or come to the aid of foreign countries. These com mi t-ments fall into two classes: (A) the general obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government as towards all other Members of the League under the Covenant, and (B) special obligations towards particular foreign countries. The commit-ments in this second class arise out of (i) the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee (Locarno); (ii) the Treaty of Alliance of 1930 with Iraq; (iii) the Unilateral Declaration of 1922 with regard to Egypt; and (iv) the provisions of the Straits Convention, signed at Lausanne in July 1923*(A)-The Covenant of the League of Nations.2. Under the Covenant His Majesty&apos;s Government, as a member of the League of Nations, are under the obligation in certain circumstances to take action for the assistance of another member or to preserve the peace of the world. These obligations may be divided into two classes : (a) Those which only arise in conformity with a decision of the Council.(b) Those which arise independently of any decision of the Council.(a) Those which only arise in conformity with a Decision of the Council.3. In these cases there is an obligation on His Majesty&apos;s Government. to take whatever action is required in conformity with a decision of the Council. His Majesty&apos;s Government are permanent members of the Council, and decisions of the Council must be adopted unanimously (but in some cases the votes of the parties in dispute are not to be counted for this purpose), and, consequently, the obligations falling into this class only arise as the result of a decision in which His Majesty&apos;s Government have concurred. Further, as His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be bound by a decision in which they had concurred, it is unnecessary to consider here the extent to which decisions of the Council recommending certain action bind Members of the League in general to take exactly the action recommended. The circumstances in which the obligation to take action, as the result of a decision by the Council, might arise are : (i) Aggression,&apos; or threat of aggression, endangering territorial integrity or political independence of a member of the League (article 10). (ii) War, or threat of war, whether immediately affecting a member of theLeague or not (article 11). (iii) Refusal by member of the League to carry out an arbitral award or judicial decision (article 13).* His Majesty&apos;s Government are also under certain obligations arising out of a series of ti-eaties placing under British protection the territories of a number of Arab rulers situated on the shores of the Persian Gulf (Koweit, Bahrein, El Qatr, the Trucial Sheikhdoms and also Muscat and Oman); I have not, however, thought it necessary to deal with these obligations here.7330   [9824]
The Covenant does not limit or specify what action-the Council should or can recommend under these articles, but it clearly has power to recommend, the employment of armed force, especially under article 10.(b) Those which arise independently of any Decision of the Council. ;4. The obligations to take action, although there has been no decision by the Council arising exclusively under articles 16 or 17, namely : (i) When a member of the League of Nations resorts to war (a) without submitting a dispute to arbitration or to the Council, and waiting for three months after the decision, or (b) against a member who is complying with an award or decision of the Council; or (ii) when a non-member State refuses to accept the obligations of membership for the purposes of a dispute and resorts to war against a member.The obligations are to sever all trade and financial relations and to prohibit inter-course with the State who has resorted to war. There is a further obligation  but this is dependent on a recommendation of the Council to contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the Covenants of the League and to support other members in any financial or economic measures taken, and to allow the passage through the territory of the armed forces which are protecting the Covenants of the League.(B)(i) The Treaty of Mutual Guarantee, 1925 [Locarno).5. The obligations of the United Kingdom under the treaty may be sum-marised as follows : (1) If the Council of the League finds that a violation of the undertaking not to go to war against each other, contained in article 2, has been committed by Germany, France or Belgium, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment is bound immediately to come to the assistance of the Power against whom the act complained of was directed. In that case, as His Majesty&apos;s Government is a permanent member of the Council, its assent is necessary to any finding.(2) If the Council finds that a breach-of articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles (relating to the demilitarisation of the Rhineland zone) has been committed, His Majesty&apos;s Government is bound to come immediately to the assistance of France and/or Belgium. In this case again His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s assent is necessary to the finding of the Council.(3) In the event of a flagrant violation of one or other of the above under-takings, His Majesty&apos;s Government is bound immediately to come to the help of the injured party, if it is satisfied that the violation constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression, and that immediate action is necessary. In this case His Majesty&apos;s Government is the sole judge as to whether its obligation is applicable.(4) If either France, Belgium or Germany refuses to submit a dispute to peaceful settlement, or to comply with an arbitral or judicial decision, His Majesty&apos;s Government is bound to comply with any proposals which the Council may make as to the steps to be taken. In this case His Majesty&apos;s Governments assent is necessary to the Council&apos;s decision.(5) There is no provision in the treaty which defines precisely what amount of action constitutes &apos;&apos; coming to the assistance&apos;&apos; of the aggrieved Power.- There can, however, be no doubt that the employment of armed force in some form is meant, at any rate in the cases referred to in (1), (2) or (3) above.6. The obligations under the Locarno Treaty are supplementary guarantees within the framework of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The circumstances in which they arise are either cases where obligations would in any case arise under article 16 of the Covenant (see 4 above), or cases where the Council might be expected to recommend some action under some other article
of the Covenant (see 3 above). The obligations under the Locarno Treaty.are, however, more definite in -their character; particularly as to the nature of the action to be taken than those existing independently under the Covenant.(ii) The Treaty of Alliance of 1930 with Iraq.7. Under article 4 of this treaty, the high contracting parties undertake that, in the event of either of them becoming engaged in war, the other high contracting party will immediately come to his aid in the capacity of an ally, and that, in the event of an imminent menace of war, the high contracting parties will immediately concert together the necessary measures of defence. This provision, as, indeed, the treaty as a whole, is conditioned by a further clause (article 9) which stipulates that &quot; nothing in the present proposals is intended to, or shall, in any way, prejudice the rights and obligations which devolve, or may devolve, upon either of the high contracting parties under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty for the Renunciation of War, signed at Paris on the 27th day of August, 1929.&quot; The effect of article 9 of this treaty is to limit the obligation of His Majesty&apos;s Government to come to the assistance of Iraq in the capacity of an ally to cases where either obligations would in any case arise under article 16 of the Covenant or the Council of the League might be expected to recommend some action for the protection of Iraq under other articles of the Covenant. However, as in the case of the Locarno Treaty, the definite obligation to come to Iraq:s assistance in the capacity of an ally is added to the more indefinite obligations otherwise incumbent upon His Majesty&apos;s Government as on all other members of the League under the Covenant.(iii) Egypt.8. In the case of Egypt, the commitment arises not under a treaty obligation towards Egypt, but under a unilateral assumption of responsibility by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Under the declaration of the 28th February, 1922, His Majesty&apos;s Government, while recognising Egypt as an independent sovereign State, reserved for their absolute discretion the defence of Egypt against all foreign aggression or interference, direct or indirect. In their notification on the 15th March, 1922, of this declaration to all foreign Powers His Majesty&apos;s Government stated that they would consider any aggression against the territory of Egypt as an act to be repelled with all the means at their command. This assumption of responsibility for the defence of Egypt is, of course, bound up with the protection of the Suez Canal as a means of communication vital to the defence of the British Empire and with the Sudan (which were also matters which His Majesty&apos;s Government reserved to their discretion under the 1922 declaration), but the assumption of responsibility for the defence of Egypt covers the whole of Egyptian territory. Egypt is not a member of the League of Nations and consequently, apart from this declaration, the obligations on His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Covenant of the League in respect of Egypt would be less than in the case of a member State and would be limited to those arising under articles 11 and 17 of the Covenant (see 3 and 4 above).(iv) The Straits Convention of 1923.9. Under the Straits Convention, which is annexed to the Treaty of Lausanne, the parties to the Treaties of Lausanne recognised and declared the principle of freedom of transit by sea and by air in the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmora and the Bosphorus, and freedom of passage for commercial vessels and aircraft and of war vessels and aircraft is secured in time of peace and of war, except that it is confined to neutrals if Turkey is a belligerent. Article 18 of the Straits Convention provides : &apos;&apos; The high contracting parties, desiring to secure that the demilitari-sation of the Straits and of the contiguous zones shall not constitute an unjustifiable danger to the military security of Turkey, and that no act of war should imperil the freedom of the Straits or the safety of the demilitarised zones, agree as follows:-&quot;Should the freedom of navigation of the Straits or the security:of the demilitarised zones be imperilled by a violation of the provisions relating to freedom of passage, or by a surprise attack of some act of war or threat
of war, the high contracting parties, and in any case France, Great Britain, Italy and Japan, acting in conjunction, will meet such violation, attack, or other act of war or threat of war, by all the means that the Council of the League of Nations may decide for this purpose. &amp;H .- &quot; The present provision, which forms an integral part of those relating to the demilitarisation and to the freedom of the Straits, does not prejudice the rights and obligations of the high contracting parties under the Covenant of the League of Nations.&quot;Now that Turkey has become a member of the League of Nations and since the obligation to take action only arises as the result of a decision of the Council, it does not appear that, strictly speaking, this article involves His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment in any responsibilities greater than those which might in any case arise under articles 10 and 11 of the Covenant. The existence of this article does, however, give His Majesty&apos;s Government, in conjunction with France, Italy and Japan, a special position with regard to the matter, but their assent is necessary to any decision of the Council under this article.J.
