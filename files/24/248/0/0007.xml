THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)COPY NO. _Lf 0COTTON TRADE COMMITTEE.REPORT. )1. At their Meeting on February 14th, 1934 (Cabinet 5 (34)Conclusion 6) the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CoP. 30 (34)) on the question of the regulationof wages in the manufacturing section of the Cotton Industry and agreed., inter alia, that a Cabinet Committee , composed as follows.-The Minister of Labour       (in the Chair)The Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsThe Secretary of State for air the president of the Board of trade the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries the Pirst Commissioner of works should consider the questions raised in CP. SO (34). and report thereon to  the Cabinet.2. We have held four meetings, over the last three of which thePrime Minister has presided.      In addition to  the Minister of Labour&apos;s original Memorandum, we have had before us further memoranda by the Minister including an outline of the provisions which, in his view, would be appropriate if it is decided to legalise agreed rates of wages in the manufacturing section of the. Cotton Industry.     For1 the text of these outlined provisions see Appendix.      We have also considered certain important points raised by the president of the Board of Trade and other members of the Committee on the proposals, and we have ascert obtained the considered views on these and other points of the two Associations concerned, namely the Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association, representing respectively the organised employers and operatives in the industry. The main question to be determined is what answer should given to the iequest made on behalf of the two Associations forRE ORE T. C.P-   72 (54)CABINET,
the legalisation of agreed rates of wages voluntarily entered into by the organised employers and operatives in the weaving section of the industry, and,  if the reply is to be in the affirmative, what should be the precise form and scope of the statutory provisions. 4, The events which have led up to the present critical situationin the weaving section of the cotton trade are set out in CP. 30 (34). A substantial and Increasing number of employers (particularly those engaged in the manufacture of the plainer cloths (i,e. mainly for export)) have taken advantage of the weakness of the operatives in the depressed circumstances of the industry and have ceased to observe the agreed working conditions;  in particular these employers are paying wages much below the rates agreed upon as part of the settlement of the 1932 dispute.      It is claimed that the general effect of this undercutting of wages and of selling prices is to impoverish the industry without increasing its total volume of business and is leading rapidly to grave labour unrest and to the collapse of the system of collective bargaining in the industry. In these circumstances the representatives of the organised employers and workpeople in the weaving industry see no ether solution than the one  they propose, namely that voluntary agreements relating to rates of wages entered into between the two sides should be given the force of law and that breaches of those agreements by individual employers should be made actionable in the Courts.5, The situation in Lancashire has grown steadily worse sincethe circulation to the Cabinet on February 9th last of the Minister of Labour&apos;s Memorandum.      In the view of the Minister if nothing is done the cotton industry will be faced in the very near future with a very grave crisis.6. There are only three possible courses open (l) to apply tothe weaving section of the cotton industry the machinery of the Trade Boards Acts;    (2) to pass ad hoc legislation strictly limited to the weaving section of the industry as proposed by the Minister of Labour and (3) to take no action of any sort.
7. A proposal to apply the Trade Boards system to a sectionof the cotton trade is open to very serious objections.     The organised employers and workpeople in the industry are strongly opposed to any such solution, and it is in the highest degree improbable that they would agree to make the joint request for the application of the system to the industry which would be necessary.      In present circumstances both employers and operatives would regard the application of the Trade Boards system to the industry as equivalent to compulsory arbitration, to any suggestion of which they would offer the most determined resistance.     Moreover, owing to the provisions relating to the methods of applying the Trade Boards Acts, such application to the weaving section of the cotton industry would bring into the field of consideration (and,therefore, of potential opposition) all manufacturers of textiles outside Lancashire. Apart from these grave difficulties,  the President of the Board of Trade would be placed in sn extremely embarrassing position in his commercial negotiations with foreign countries if the Government were now to suggest that the cotton trade was suitable for Trade Board treatment;    this would certainly be interpreted abroad as implying that the trade is, or had been, a sweated one.8. For these and other reasons we are satisfied that theapplication of the Trade Boards Acts to the weaving section of the industry is quite impracticable, and we cannot therefore recommend the Cabinet to entertain it as a possible solution. There remain the alternatives of doing nothing or of passing ad hoc legislation.9. We agree with the Minister of Labour&apos;s view that itwould be very difficult, if not impossible, to justify refusal to take any action.      Both sides in the industry have joined in asking the Government to legislate, and have repeatedly emphasised their considered opinion that if nothing is done
the whole system of collective bargaining in the industry will collapse, confusion and chaos will result, and labour unrest may be expected to take very grave and sinister forms.   We cannot recommend the Cabinet to take the risks involved in a policy of inaction, 4310. There remains the third alternative, namely the adoption asan experiment of the method of ad hoc legislation strictly limited to the weaving section of %he industry in the Lancashire area.    In effect power would be given to the Minister of Labour to give legal force to an agreement made between the parties with regard to wages.    The procedure would be that as soon as an agreement had been reached,  its terms would be advertised to the trade for the purpose of eliciting objections.    It would then be examined by three independent persons appointed by the Minister sitting with representatives of the Assoc-negotiations which had made the agreement:    the representatives acting as assessors.        If the three independent persons unanimously agree to recommend the making of an Order, the application would be forwarded to the Minister, who would, be at liberty dither to make the Order or to refer the proposals back to the Associations;    he would, however, have no power to amend the proposals.   Any operative to whom a rate of wages sanctioned by an Order applies would be entitled to receive wages at a rate not lower than the sanctioned rate, and to recover the same by action in the Courts.11. Our attention has been drawn to a number of points arising onthe Minister&apos;s proposals, and at our request such of these points as concern the industry have been examined by the Minister of Labour in conference with the representatives of the two Associations concerned. It is unnecessary to trouble the Cabinet with the details of these discussions, and it will suffice to say that in our opinion,  if the principle involved is accepted, there do not appear to be any practical difficulties which cannot be overcome by discussion with the interested parties.    We may, however, point out that both sides agree that no responsibility should fall on the Government for the actual terms of the agreements reached by-a-
them and also that the existence of the statutory sanction      &apos; should facilitate rather than otherwise the making of agree-ments between the two sides in future.12. It has also been represented that the adoption of theproposals in the case of this particular industry will lead to demands for the extension of the same procedure to the mining and other industries.    We recognise this difficulty, but think that its importance may be exaggerated.     We would point out that the proposals are in the nature of an experiment:    if they prove successful there is no reason why they should not be extended to other industries where the circumstances and conditions are the same, i.e. where both sides are well organised, where agreements governing hours and wages are made, but where the difficulty is to secure general and loyal observance of such agreements.    In the mining industry, for example, no problem arises on the observance of an agreement when made, the difficulty is to get the two sides to agree terms.13. It can hardly be assumed that legislation on the lines proposed will be regarded as non-contentious.     Hitherto, bothcapital and labour in most of the important industries have generalopposed/legislation of this character.     Although Trade Union opinion is known to be acutely divided on the question of principle, we understand that the Trade Union Congress is not likely to raise opposition, and that the Weavers&apos; Association have undertaken to see that the Labour Party will not stand in the way.     We are also informed that the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations are unlikely to oppose legislation limited as proposed in the present case.14. After very careful consideration we are unanimously ofopinion that the proposals of the Minister of Labour forad hoc legislation strictly limited to the weaving section of HieLancashire cotton industry,and safeguarded as we propose, afford the
the only possible solution of the problem, and that, on balance,  the advantages of adopting them outweigh the objections which have been raised to them.   We think that if it is decided to introduce legislation to give effect to the proposals, steps should be taken to ensure the passage of the Bill into law before the Autumn Recess.15. We accordingly recommend the Cabinet *-(l) To accept,  in principle,  the proposal of the Minister of Labour that legislation should be introduced forthwith,  as an experiment, to make agreed rates of wages binding throughout the manufacturing section of the cotton industry in the-Lancashire area. The legislation to be strictly limited to this particular section of the industry and to be operative for a limited period of, say, three years.(2) To approve, as a rough basis of theproposed legislation,  the provisions out-lined in the Appendix to this Report.(3) To authorise the Minister of Labour to arrange for the preparation of a draft Bill on the lines approved by the Cabinet, on the understanding that the Minister of Labour will consult with the President of the Board of Trade generally on the details of the Bill, and in particular in regard to certain outstanding matters, e.g.  scope, sanctions,  etc. which have been remitted to them for consideration.(4) That the draft Bill should be circulated to the Cabinet in order that the policy embodied in it may be considered and finally approved before the Bill is referred to the Home Affairs Committee.Signed on behalf of the Committee HENRY BETTERTON, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 13th March, 1934.
APPENDIX.OUTLINE OP PROVISIONS POR THE MANUFACTURING SECTION OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY. &apos;1.       The Bill would define the Section of the Cotton Industry in respect of which powers were being taken. 2.     The Bill would give the Minister of Labour power, upon a joint application in writing from an association of employers and an association of employees, to make an Order giving statutsry effect to a rate or rates of wages agreed to by such association of employers and such association of employees.     No application should be considered unless the associations represent not less than seventy per cent,  of the employers and workers concerned respectively.3.       The rates may apply universally to the trade, or to any special process of work in the trade, or to any special area, or to any class of workers in any special process or in any special area as defined in the agreement.4.       The agreement nay include conditions requiring that questions as to any breach of conditions contained in the agreement, and in the Order, shall be determined in a specified manner (e.g. by Joint Rules and Conciliation Committee).5.        No Order shall have effect for longer than twelve months. (It might be desirable to make it possible for a longer or shorter period to be fixed in the original Order by joint agreement). 6.        Any Order may be varied or revoked or continued for a further period with or without modification by a subsequent Order made Upon a joint application of the associations.7.       When the associations desire certain rates of wages to be made obligatory they shall give public notice of their intention to apply for an Order and shall make particulars of the rates in question available to all concerned in the industry. 8.       Three weeks shall be allowed after the public notice in which objections to the rates may be lodged with the Minister who shall forward them to the associations.
9,       The rates, and the objections to them,  shall be considered by representatives of the two associations sitting with independent members approved by the Minister (e.g.   the Conciliation Committee already appointed).10.      If it is decided to proceed with the application, without serious modification of the rates, the application to the Minister shall be accompanied by the observations of the neutral members on any objections which have not been met,11.      Before making an Order the Minister may take any advice he pleases on the matter.      He may either make the Order or refer it back to the associations.      He may not amend it.12,      Where any rate of wages has been sanctioned by Order every employee to whom such rate applies shall be entitled to receive from his employers wages at a rate not lower than the rate so sanctioned.13.      Any employee may recover sums in respect of wages in any court of competent  jurisdiction.        An association may act on his behalf.14. Employers shall keep records to show that the provisions are complied with. There shall be responsibility upon an employer to produce such records in any proceedings.15.      Any agreement for the payment of wages in contravention of the provisions of an Order shall be void.16.      Officers of a Government Department  shall have power to enter premises and examine conditions and records.      (The Factory InspectorsT present powers may be sufficient.    It is not intended by this power to provide for inspection as under the Trade Boards Acts) .
