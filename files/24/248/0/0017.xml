Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 81 (34).CABINET.JAPANESE TRADE COMPETITION.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I CIRCULATE a memorandum on Japanese trade competition which I promised my colleagues at our meeting on the 19th March.I myself have no doubt as to the desirability of maintaining the friendliest possible relations, in this and other spheres, with Japan. And, in fact, as my colleagues will observe, there is not much that we could do in the economic sphere in the way of either defence or aggression.The memorandum sets out five courses of action which may be urged upon us. For the moment, I propose to rest publicly on the announcement I have already made in the House, that I am in communication with the Japanese Government; and I hope that I shall have the support of my colleagues in resisting, for the present at any rate, demands for other action. If Governmental discussions fail, we may be driven to other action by the pressure of public opinion at home, but I should hope, even so, that we might be able to resist the demand of the less intelligent public for violent and, in my opinion, futile action.(Initialled) W. R.Board of Trade, March 20, 1934.JAPANESE COMPETITION.(A) Facts of the Problem.1. Complaints of the effects of Japanese competition in home and especially in export markets have become increasingly numerous during the last three years, and though some of the causes of the present acute stage of the competition may be temporary, e.g., the depreciation of the yen, there is no doubt that the problem is a grave one. Since 1931, while world trade has been declining, total Japanese exports (at least in terms of yen) have been steadily increasing; Japanese imports into this country have remained steady in a period of declining trade and declining values; and United Kingdom exports to Japan have fallen by between  1 or  2 million per year in the last three years. On the other hand, total Japanese imports have increased almost as much as her exports, and it would thus be a mistake to suppose that the industrial development of Japan is in every way a bad thing for us; for example, the growth of the Japanese woollen industry has increased the demand for wool and so has substantially benefited Australia and indirectly our own export trade to Australia.[9818] b
2. The position in the various industries in which. Japanese competition has been most pronounced has been examined and the general conclusions are as follows: (a) In the home market there has not, at any rate as yet, been any very substantial increase in the aggregate value of imports from Japan, although, in the cases of silk and rayon and electric lamps, the recent increases have been considerable, while in the case of rubber footwear the imports were assuming formidable proportions until they were largely stopped by the heavy specific duties which were imposed on these goods in May, 1933.(b) In the overseas markets Japan has gained very substantially at theexpense of the United Kingdom in the very important cotton trade, though it must be remembered that the major part of the loss in exports suffered by our cotton industry is to be attributed to the growth of local industry in its principal markets, such as India and China. In other industries the effects of Japanese competition have not as yet been generally very serious, although there is evidence that, while her proportion of the trade is still small, Japan is steadily gaining ground in a number of other industries, such as rayon, cement, rubber goods, pottery, soap and paints and varnishes.3. The export trade is the trade most seriously attacked, and at the same time it is the most difficult to safeguard. In the first place, the proportion of Japanese exports going to markets over which we can exercise any influence (i.e., to certain parts of the Colonial Empire) is relatively small, as appears from the following figures for the year 1932, which also bring out the overwhelming importance of cotton and rayon : To-Cotton and Rayon.

Action against Japan in East Africa is precluded by the Congo Basin Convention, while Ceylon has refused to accord us even a preference of 10 per cent. Thus our exports of cotton goods to the Colonies in which we are likely to be able to take action to protect the trade of this country represented only about 10 per cent, of our total exports of cotton goods in 1933 (about 200 out of 2,0007square yards). Even this figure is probably too high, as it includes Hong*&quot;Kong and the Straits Settlements, both of which would find it difficult to take action without serious damage to their important entrepot trade, a large part of the exports consigned to them being no doubt sent on to other countries.5. Further, while it is true that the balance of trade between this country and Japan is no longer in our favour, it has to be remembered that Japan is an important market for the British Empire, especially for Australia, and that (excluding India) her balance of trade with the Empire is in favour of the Empire. If, therefore, trade relations were seriously affected, the Empire would stand to lose at least as much as Japan.   The figures for 1933 are as follows : ?Trade of J apan with British Empire (excluding India, an&amp;4he Colonies) in 1932^.&quot;	Imports.	Exports.	Yen.

At the same time is has to be borne in mind that Japan is a country of 67,000,000 inhabitants increasing by 1,000,000 annually. It is essential to her, if her population cannot expand into other territory, to increase her imports in order to maintain this growing population, and she can only increase her imports by further expansion of her export trade. It is probable, therefore, that any concerted attempt by any large section of the world to prevent or substantially restrict such expansion would have grave political consequences.7. It was with the foregoing facts in mind, and also because action in the Colonies might merely divert Japanese competition to other markets, which we could not control, that it was decided in April of last year that an attempt should be made in the first place to deal with the problem in the cotton and rayon industries, by mutual agreement between the industries of Japan and this country which should cover the markets of the world. The opening of the discussions was, however, seriously delayed, mainly by the intervention of the Indian negotia-tions, and they have now broken down owing to the. refusal of the Japanese delegates to extend the geographical scope of the discussions beyond the markets of the United Kingdom and the Colonies. Other industries have been told that they must await the outcome of these discussions which it had been hoped would point the way to a remedy for their problem also. The failure of the discussions will, therefore, be the signal for intensified pressure upon the Government to take action against Japanese competition, not only from the cotton and rayon industries, but also from a number of others, some with substantial grounds of complaint, but others merely joining in the hue and cry.[9818] b 2
(B) Action which His Majesty&apos;s Government will probably be asked to take.8. The, Government may expect to be met with a very early or immediate demand : I.- To abrogate the commercial treaty with Japan. II. To take adequate steps to protect United Kingdom industries in the home market.III. To introduce adequate measures to protect United Kingdom exporttrade in the Colonies. IV. To enlist the Dominions in an Empire Policy to keep out Japanesegoods.V. To use such influence with foreign countries as may be at their disposal to safeguard United Kingdom trade where it is threatened by-Japanese competition in foreign markets, including possibly a proposal to terminate the Saint-Germain Convention, governing the Congo Basin Area (which includes British East Africa).I. Denunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty.9. The purpose of denunciation (of which twelve months&apos; notice is required) would be to enable us to discriminate against Japanese goods in the United Kingdom and in the Colonies. It would equally enable the Japanese to discriminate against our goods and against our shipping and nationals. A Bill has this month been introduced into the Japanese Diet to give the Japanese Government powers to do this readily. There is as yet no power in this country to take discriminatory action against any country which has not first discrimination -nated against us.10. The main arguments against denunciation of the Treaty are that it is not necessary, and that it involves substantial economic and political dangers : (i) There is no evidence up to the present that adequate measures cannot be taken to circumscribe Japanese competition both in the United Kingdom market and in the Colonies without resort to discrimination. (See paragraphs 11-17 below.) (ii) Tho area of trade we can cover is in any case relatively small and the political and economic risks involved are great. Thus in the case of the cotton industry wre could only deal with Colonial markets, and among these we probably cannot cover the entrepot centres; we should still be powerless to take action in the important markets of East Africa, which must remain bound for some time by the Congo Basin Treaties; and we may be unable to persuade Ceylon to impose restric-tions on cheap Japanese goods. Moreover, in British West Africa, far the most important of the remaining Colonial markets for cotton piece-goods (see table in paragraph 4 above), we have already taken steps to free our hands by denouncing the Treaty so far as it applies to this area.^iii) Denunciation of the Treaty might involve us in a commercial war with Japan in which we, as well as Japan, would suffer serious losses. The trade balance between us and Japan is now in Japan&apos;s favour, but we still have a valuable, though in most cases declining, export trade with Japan in such important classes of goods as chemicals, wool textiles, machinery and iron and steel. Anything savouring of economic war would inevitably hasten the decline of our exports with consequent immediate ill effects on United Kingdom exporters. In shipping Japan could probably damage us a good deal more than we could damage her. According to the Japanese navigation statistics, 8^ million tons of British ships entered at Japanese ports in the year 1932, of which 1 million was described as Canadian and Hong Kong shipping. It is uncertain from the statistics where the ships comprising the balance of 1\ million tons were registered, but a good deal of it must have been United Kingdom shipping.   There
is also a substantial amount of British capital invested in Japan (estimated at  63 million at December 1930). The Japanese are already showing an embarrassing amount of hostility towards foreign companies operating in Japan, and a serious breach between the two countries might be likely to be really damaging from this point of view..   II,-Steps to Protect United Kingdom Industries in the Home Market.11. So far as the home market is concerned, there is as yet no evidence that, as and when Japanese competition develops in particular products, it will not be possible to check it, as in the case of rubber boots and shoes, by the imposition of suitably designed duties applicable to all foreign imports, though in some cases the possible reactions on the trade of other foreign countries may need special consideration. Apart from rubber footwear, the products in which Japanese competition has up to the present mainly made itself felt in the United Kingdom market are :: Electric lamps.Silk and rayon tissues.12. As regards electric lamps, the Import Duties Advisory Committee have already reported, recommending high specific duties specially aimed at imports from Japan, but in view of the industrial discussions then proceeding on cotton and rayon, it was not thought desirable to give effect at once to these recommen-dations. It was felt necessary, too, to take into account the fact that the imposition of the new duties might result in a severe reduction in the number of the cheap lamps sold by the chain stores. Instead a proposal has been made to the Japanese Government that a suspension of the new duties would be considered, provided that the Japanese exports of electric lamps to this market are curtailed and are limited to an agreed figure during the year 1934; this has been agreed in principle and discussions are still proceeding as to what this level should be. One of the matters for consideration is whether the discussion should now be discon-tinued and the duties put into force.13. As regards silk and rayon, the Import Duties Advisory Committee had brought their consideration of a scheme of revision of the silk and rayon duties to an advanced stage when in September 1933 the Government requested them to suspend their work in view of the pending discussions on cotton and rayon. It is understood that the Committee contemplated recommending an adjustment of the silk duties involving some increase in the element of protection in the case of goods in the higher ranges of value (such as.are produced by European countries) together with an alternative rate of duty based upon yardage, which would impose a heavy charge on the cheaper imports of the kind which come, to a large extent, from Japan. The suspension of the Committee&apos;s work has been the subject of considerable criticism from the interests concerned, and there will undoubtedly now be considerable pressure upon the Government to allow the Committee to complete their task. In the changed circumstances, it would appear to be difficult to refuse this request, although when the recommendations are received their possible reaction upon imports from other countries, notably France, Italy and Switzerland will have to be carefully considered.14. Much has appeared in the Press with regard to the imports of cheap Japanese goods into the United Kingdom, covering a wide range of products including Pottery, Hosiery, Clothing and Toys. The volume of the imports from Japan of these goods at the present time represents only a very small share of the total British consumption and there is, so far as can be seen, no reason for varying the usual procedure under which the industries concerned present their case for a revision of the existing duties to the Import Duties Advisory Committee.lll.-lmmediate Action to protect United Kingdom Trade in theColonial Empire.15. It is thought that without denouncing the Treaty it should be possible to take satisfactory action by quotas or specific duties, or both combined, to check Japanese competition in all markets in which we should be able to take -discriminatory action if the Treaty were denounced.
In. the-British territories of West Africa we shall be free after the 16th May next to discriminate specifically against Japan either by quotas or duties, if that course appears desirable. ... -We cannot take action in East Africa either by preference or by quota while the Saint-Germain Treaty remains intact. No doubt we shall be pressed to release ourselves from this Convention, but this would take time and would not free us to introduce imperial preference as an earlier instrument, (the Berlin Act) would remain in force. Termination of the Convention would only, therefore, be of use if the object were to discriminate against Japan; it would entail calling a Conference of the countries who are parties to the Treaty, and it might be difficult to avoid giving the impression of a conspiracy against Japan even if we did not state our reasons for wishing to terminate or modify the Convention.It is possible that Ceylon may be more willing to introduce quotas than she has been to give us a preference on cotton goods, as the effect on the price to the consumer is not so direct.  Semi-official enquiries are being made on this point.It has been assumed that we cannot cover Hong Kong and the Straits Settle-ments owing to the interference with their entrepot trade which would be involved. For this reason there is no general preferential tariff in these Colonies.16. Enquiries which have been made indicate that the specific duties which have already been imposed on cotton and rayon goods in various Colonies, &amp;c, have had little effect in diverting trade from Japan to the United Kingdom, and quotas appear therefore to be the most suitable method to adopt for these goods. The question of the year or average of years on which quotas for cotton and rayon goods should be based is being examined. It would of course be possible by selecting a period of years some time ago to eliminate Japan entirely or almost entirely from the trade of the Colonies, but, apart from the objection which there, would be to this course from some at least of the Colonies on the groundV of the burden on the consumer, it may be thought desirable, in view of Japan&apos;s / -ffiidaunted economic power, to act with reasonable moderation in the Colonies.y (The volume of trade we can affect is relatively very small, and if we keep it out of the Colonies it will no doubt go elsewhere. Moreover, the effect of very-drastic measures on opinion in Japan might very well be more serious than the effects of such measures would warrant. Moderation will no doubt lay us open to criticism from Lancashire on the ground that in the British Colonies Lancashire has a right to get back all her lost trade. But moderate opinion in Lancashire would probably appreciate the position and nothing short of a commercial war with Japan may be expected to satisfy the extremists.17. The case of other industries suffering from Japanese competition in the Colonies can also, if necessary, be dealt with by quotas, but it would be preferable, where possible, to meet the position by specific duties applicable to all foreign imports.IV. Question of Approaching the Dominions.18. India (the most important market for cotton goods) has made a separate agreement with Japan. United Kingdom manufacturers experience competition with Japan in other Dominion markets, especially Australia, and there has already been pressure on the Government to enlist the Dominions in an Empire policy to deal with Japanese competition. The Dominions have been kept informed of the steps taken in this country, but no. approach has been made to them.19. Australia has a very favourable balance of trade with Japan and would, presumably, be unwilling to join us against her. The Australian Government have just despatched a political Mission to Japan and other Far Eastern Countries.20. If it were decided to approach the Dominions and any concerted action resulted, it could hardly appear to Japan in any other light than as a declaration of economic war by the British Empire. Whether such action on our part could be confined to the economic sphere is by no means certain the dangers of concerted economic action against Japan have been repeatedly impressed upon us by the Embassy at Tokio but, even supposing it could, we should be likely to
lose at least as heavily as Japan in a trial of strength, since the Empire (exclusive of India) has a larger export trade to Japan than Japan has to the Empire. It is possible, on the other hand, that Japanese shipping would suffer more than ours in a commercial war between Japan and the Empire as a whole.21. If it is decided not to approach the Dominions, United Kingdom manufacturers will have to rely on action taken in those Dominions (as in India) to protect their own industries, and this might, in fact, prove to be a not inconsiderable benefit.V. Possibility of Approaching Foreign Countries.This question involves political as well as economic considerations. The types of action we have been asked to take already and shall no doubt be asked to take in the future are : (1) To support with another foreign Government an agreement made between the industry in this country and the industry of another country; for example, the Dutch and United Kingdom cotton industries (and the United Kingdom and French cotton industries, only tentatively) have each held conversations as to the policy they consider desirable in the Colonies of their respective countries which in effect would have the object of reducing Japanese imports, and co-operation between the Governments is required if their agreements are to be carried into effect.(2) To obtain favourable terms for this country when other countries impose quotas or protective duties on their goods. Thus, we are having to make representations to the Dutch Government about the quotas in the Dutch East Indies, the effect of which representations, if agreed to, will be in the direction of reducing the allocation to Japan and increasing it to this country.(3) To approach the Governments of countries in which we have lost or are losing trade to Japan with a request that they shall take action calculated to restore our trade and thus reduce that of Japan. Thus, Manchester have already suggested that we should approach the Iraq Government asking them to impose depreciated currency duties and that we should use our influence with the Egyptian Government in the direction of quotas.There is obviously a distinction between (a) approaching a foreign Govern-ment with a request to impose quotas or restrictions which will have the effect of restoring our trade to us and limiting Japanese trade and (b) using our influence to obtain good terms when a country has decided, in its own interests, to impose restrictions on Japanese trade, or even, as in Egypt, throwing in our influence on the side of such decision.o
