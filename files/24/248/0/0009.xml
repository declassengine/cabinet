AGRICULTURAL   POLICY   IN   U.S.A.Extracts from an article by Prof. R. G. Tugwell, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, in &quot;The New York Times&quot; (Sunday, January 14th, 1934)Re-Settling America: A Vast Land ProgramBy  REXFORD G.  TUGWELL,Assistant Secretary of AgricultureThrough the Surplus Relief Corporation there has been lately appropriated a fund of $25,000,000 for the selective retirement of marginal land, not piece-meal, patch by patch, but by whole farms, tracts and areas. This is our first definite step in the new direction of long-time land adjustments throughout the country.Where is this land which should be removed from private cultivation and restored to the public domain ? We have at the moment only general studies to direct us to it. Land utilization surveys to date have not been designed with the specific purpose of land retirement, but only for a general assessment of regional possibilities. We need more information than that, and it should be such as will tell not only the economic but the social price of farming lean acres, and trying to raise a family there.We do know in a general way that the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains, North and South, hold in their higher portions many farms which amount to economic and social man-traps, but they hold also among their foothills, and in certain upland valleys, fruitful and rewarding farms. Our high dry-land areas demand re-examination; so does the cut-over country of our more Western lake shore. Many thousands of acres there have reverted to county and State governments because skilled farmers, used to harsh living, could not dig out taxes, let alone a living, in that earth.. A bandoned Farms A ttract the Innocent.Nevertheless, certain realtor gentlemen have been brandishing these aban-abandoned farms before green city people as a positively Arcadian refuge from fear and unemployment. That is criminal. It should be stopped. And while we are on the subject of tihe unwarranted entrapment of innocents, let me say that in my opinion the government should repeal its Homestead Law. There remains no free farmland which is other than a grudging invitation to economic suicide.I have been shown land-use programs which go so far as to indicate tracts and regions of America where land reclamation projects should be undertaken, and other smaller areas suitable for induced resettlement, sustained by more intensive agricultural development, and possibly also by a certain degree of industrial transplantation, with smaller factories, in rural settings, decentralized.These plans are based on the little we know at present about our land. They make, necessarily, a highly tentative presentation, and, to my way of thinking, they demonstrate little more than the need of much closer study. It seems to me impossible now to mark solidly any considerable expanse of America as suitable for complete retirement from commercial farm production.No Monopoly on Good Farmland or on Bad.No one great part of America has a complete natural monopoly on good farmland or on bad. It would be a nice idea, and one most appealing to the arbitrary planner, to resettle Americans sweepingly, out of this region into that one; uprooting men, their flesh and blood, their loves and memories, with as cool and commanding an intelligence as governs the movement of men in a game of chess.   But I tJhink the job cannot be done in that way, and should not.   We
do not know enough, and I doubt if we ever shall know enough, any one of us, to assume the power of arbitrarily transplanting people from their native soil and location.We are taking out of competitive production, as it is, a great deal of land, farm by farm, pro rata. Faced with the fact that we have been planting some 40,000,000 or 50,000,000 acres of land in staple crops to be sold in foreign markets now largely closed to us, we have moved to retire that surplus acreage from cultivation and to put it to other use.Nine-tenths of our cotton planters co-operated last year to take out 10,500,000 acres of cotton, more than a quarter of the entire American acreage in that crop. This year they will reduce the national planting of cotton from. 40,000,000 to 25,000,000 acres. Our wheat growers, operating in accord with a world wheat agreement, will reduce the national sowing some 7,500,000 acres in 1934.Moving in the same manner, co-operatively, through county production control associations, our corn and hog growers will remove in advance from next year&apos;s market, by not seeding it, some 20,000,000 acres of corn, and will make a corresponding reduction in pork production.Twenty million acres are taken out of corn, 15,000,000 acres taken out of cotton, 7,500,000 acres out of wheat; add to that the 500,000 acres which we shall probably take out of tobacco in the next year or so, and the total, if our present programs secure the degree of co-operation anticipated, is 43,000,000 acres to be displaced. Forty-three million acres is nearly one-eighth of all the crop land now harvested in the United States.Land Retirement Only at its Beginning.This vast acreage is being retired to grass or other protecting and non-competing crops under the allotment plan, farm by farm, pro rata. In other words, it is being taken out in small scattered patches on the basis of where those crops happen to be now. We are only now beginning to move toward a more selective retirement of lands. If we continue as a nation to push or to be pushed toward a self-contained economic nationalism; if foreign trade remains on the basis of taking out the thinnest, meanest, most punishing areas rather than at the low levels of recent years; and if we proceed with selective withdrawals those of average productivity or better, we may have to retire as much as 100,000,000 acres of American soil from commercial culivation.Until we know whether we are going to farm for ourselves, as a nation, or farm in some measure for the whole world again, we can have, obviously, no hard and fast land program. Perhaps we shall never attain to that dream of the social philosopher, a blueprint room, with rigid, perfect plans for land and all national resources.That may be just as well. I suspect dogmatic planning. It involves prophecy; prophecy implies certainty; and there are no certainties to-day. The old assurance that snugness and a fat, fixed future for all of us lay just around the corner is now lacking. Our national lie to-day is a lie of conscious risks. Just around the corner lies a new country; there are vast uncertainties, endless problems. Let us attack these problems as they come.In writing, then, of the new destinations toward which, with our new and as yet lumbering social machinery, we seem to be proceeding, I mean only to indicate possibilities and not to prophesy. I do not say, &quot; This is what we shall be or do &quot;; but merely, &quot; This, from our present start, is what we may be or do, if we have courage, patience and strength enough.&quot;Age of Discretion after our Childhood.Sooner or later a people in a new country, like any one of us among them, must bow to limits, stop grabbing and grow up. Our exciting and terrible adventure beyond the water; the false spell of prosperity and forced expansion that we managed to pump up afterward in the face of world cloture of markets against our goods, enormous structures of old debt and the subsequent catastrophe, may all have served as hastening shocks in bringing us to the end of a prodigal national childhood.
&quot; We (have swarmed over this continent like demanding, thoughtless children,&quot; said M. L. Wilson in a recent address on public policy. Now we must settle down, put our lands in order, rid our hearts and minds of the barbaric notion that unlimited economic conflict leads somehow to universal balance and plenty, and learn to live together as a civilized people should.In far more ways than show in the tabled indices of business, I think it may be said now that the tide has turned. This nation has come of age and turned from a confused and wishful appeal to the past to confront the future. It would be hard to say whether we have ruled events thus far as much as we have been ruled by them, but at least we have lifted our heads and taken hold.This time last year we were a people bowed down and taking it. Fear and despair gripped us. We did not know what to do. On the land, towering crop surpluses; in financial centres, towering corporate surpluses, reared to dangerous heights, and in the shadow of these vast concentrations of overplenty hundreds of thousands of our people went cold and hungry.Light in the Valley of our Agriculture. In a society which lives by the exchange of goods and services vast surpluses create great valleys of want. Agriculture^ valley was deep and dark last year. Things are better now. Not so much better as we should like to have them; not so much better as we hope in time to make them. But there is light now at the far end of the valley; and we are on the march. The value of American farm crops will be $1,200,000,000 greater for the year 1933 than it was in the year 1932; and we disbursed by the end of the year, in addition, $164,000,000 to farmers in adjustment payments.Purchasing power had to be seeded back at ground line, to rise through the structure of an opportunists capitalistic system weakened by fear and inaction. We have done this by adjustment payments and by other means. In return for our adjustment payments we are trying to get a balanced farm production and a permanently healthy trading balance between our major producing groups.No one can say just how much of the improvement thus far visible is due to our programs, and how much derives from other causes. No one can say for certain whether the marked improvement observable in regions reached by cotton and wheat adjustment payments will spread permanently throughout our general business structure and last. To my mind, the improvement is fundamental, and a great deal of it will make itself felt to the far ends of this country for years to come.Pressed by need, we have moved fast. A year ago, some of us had various plans for social machinery by which the creative impulses, the energy and the technical skill of the individual farmer could be turned to the general designs of a prosperous agriculture and a prosperous nation, and not turned loose blindly and combatively against the common interest. We felt that such social machinery could be created, but no man in the world could have predicted in detail the shape and form of the new American design. To-day, production control machinery not only exists, it lives and moves, rocking and dashing us along untried ways towards a planned democratic society, rebuilt from the ground up.Already we have disbursed to farmers more than $200,000,000 in adjustment payments. In 1934 we may disburse in adjustment payments as much as $700,000,000 more.Funds come from, the Processing Taxes.These payments are made to induce cooperative adjustments of farm produc-tion; under our present method we are getting that money from processing taxes. To the extent that they are passed on to the consumer, these are in effect sales taxes. That is unpopular, but I think it is just. I do not feel that the cost of making social and economic adjustments which are vital to the welfare of the whole country should be borne by the farming class exclusively. But once this adjustment is effected, and parity restored, our processing taxes disappear auto-matically, under the present act.   What then ?Is it not possible that by that time agriculture will be very closely and effectively organized to operate effectively in its own behalf ? I think so. The spectacular part of our production adjustment efforts, the part that stands forth
visibly, is the land we are taking out of competitive production. The fact that we are accumulating and verifying production figures, farm by farm, throughout the country; and the fact that we are organizing the farmers, county by county, to act on those figures cooperatively, to farm together rather than against each other that almost escapes attention. But this new mobilization of agriculture may in the long run prove the most valuable thing we are getting out of these emergency drives and manoeuvres.The Social Machinery outside of Washington.It is not really in Washington that the most important part of our new social machinery is now to be seen. Washington is merely the showier, central part of the New Deal for agriculture. Think of the 1,450 county wheat produc-tion control associations now set up and operating, the 900 cotton production control associations in as man)7 Southern counties, the 1,500 or more similar associations that will be set up in 1,500 Corn Belt counties this Spring for integrating the production of corn and hogs, farm by farm.These county councils, set up on a commodity basis, will in many counties where agriculture is diversified overlap and quite possibly merge into one county production control council. Allied with that central farmers&apos; planning group, perhaps, will be the representatives of more special production groups there, operating under licenses and agreements. Your imagination, in looking to the future of these county councils, is quite as much to be relied upon as mine; these organizations have just started; no one can say what direction or forms they will take. But I do feel this : They have in them the vital part, and the most enduring-part, of our new social control machinery for agriculture.In all, we have already moved to take out of export crops which, dammed up behind tariff barriers, have been choking our markets and killing trade, an area exceeding thrice the entire cultivated area of Japan proper. These are all key crops. To alter the proportionate seeding of any one of them over the 1,906,000,000 acres of the continental United States as a whole is to alter the basic pattern not only of our agriculture but perhaps of our national life.(2201il-F6)   Wt. 110829-0210  125  3/31  V.
