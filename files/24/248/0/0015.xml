This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet March, 1934SECRETCopy No. 4 0CP. 79 (34)121THE CABINETTHE ARMY AND AIR FORGE (ANNUAL) bill memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI circulate herewith the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill. 110Apart from some drafting and minor amendments contained in the Second and   General Third Schedules, only two amendments are proposed this year, the first of which    4794 affects both the Army and the Air Force Acts and the second affects the Army Act only.The first amendment (Clause 4) simplifies a detail of administration concerning the convening of courts-martial when necessary in troop-shipss as explained in the introductory memorandum of the Bill.The second amendment (Clause 7) makes provision for regulating the relations between members of the new Indian Air Force and members of the military forces in India when serving together, and is a clause parallel to the amendment made in the Air Force Act last year dealing with the relations of the new force to the Royal Air Force. In the event of a unit of the new Indian Air Force being at the same station as or otherwise serving together with a unit of the Army in India, the clause enables powers of command and discipline to be given to members of one force over members of the other in such circumstances and subject to such exceptions and limitations as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Army Council and the Governor-General.As regards the question, to which I alluded in my Memorandum on last year&apos;s Bill,* of the status to be given to the new type of Indian officer in the Indian Army in relation to the British personnel of the military forces, it has been decided that this question can be dealt with by King&apos;s Regulations made under Section 71 of the Army Act and no amendment of the Act is required.The Bill must receive the Royal Assent by the end of April, and it may be necessary to take the second reading before Easter. I therefore ask the concurrence of my colleagues in the immediate circulation of the Bill.The War Office,16th March, 1934.* CP. 68 (33).CB34/8)   70   3/8)   W.O.P.   7724
INTRODUCTORY MEMORANDUM. Clause 4.At a port of embarkation the officer who is to be in command of troops on board during, the voyage receives a warrant authorising him to convene, and con-firm the findings of, a district court martial for the trial of any offence committed by persons under his command on board the ship. This warrant, however, only covers the troops who embark at the original port of departure; and, if other troops join at an intermediate port, an additional warrant in respect of them must be issued to the officer commanding troops on board by the officer in command at that port. A vessel taking troops from England to the East may pick up details at several intermediate ports, and the issuing of warrants (in identical words) at all of them, and the ultimate returning of each warrant to the issuer, entails un-necessary clerical work. The amendment proposed will enable a warrant to be issued to the commancling officer which will cover all troops who may be under his command during the voyage, whether they embark with him or join at some port of call.Clause 7.The Government of India have now commenced the formation of the new Indian Air Force. The personnel of this force will be Indian, and provision for its discipline has been made by an Act of the Indian Legislature the Indian Air Force Act, 1932. It is necessary, however, to make provision to regulate the relations between members of the new force and members of the military forces when units are doing-duty at the same station or are otherwise serving together.The proposed new clause deals with this point on lines similar to those of section 184a of the Army Act which governs the relations between military, naval and air forces when acting together. -65-3 A
