LEAGUE OF NATIONS (Disarmament).March 13, 1934.CONFIDENTIALSection 2.[W 2496/1/98]No. 1.Sir G. Clerk to Sir John Simon. (Received March 13.)(No. 144.) Sir,Brussels, March 10, 1934.WITH reference to my telegram No. 10 of to-day, I have the honour to reporr, that I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning in the sense of tht instructions contained in your telegram No. 26 of the 8th instant.2. I gave M. Hymans a brief oral summary of Mr. Eden&apos;s conversations in Paris, Berlin and Rome, the record of which had reached me late yesterda\ evening, and I asked his Excellency to give the considered views of the Belgian Government on the British memorandum to His Majesty&apos;s Government as soor as possible. I added that I greatly hoped the Belgian Government would accept that memorandum as the basis of a disarmament convention, since it was of immense importance to the peace of the world to reach some international agreement on disarmament, and no practical or better alternative to the British memorandum had been or, so far as I could see, was likely to be, forthcoming.3. M. Hymans listened with the greatest attention and took written note of one or two points in my oral summary of Mr. Eden&apos;s reports, but offered no direct reply to anything I said. He observed that the two points in the situation as expounded in the British memorandum which had most interested Belgian opinion were the question of security and that of the German para-military formations. It was, I gathered, largely because of what seemed to the Belgian Government the indefiniteness of British assurances of support in the memorandum that the Belgian Government had inclined towards the Italian memorandum, which, anyhow, left the armaments of France and other ex-Allied Powers at their present level. I said that I certainly did not prefer the Italian memorandum, not because the other emanated from my own Government, but for various reasons : one, because the essence of the discussions at Geneva was to achieve some measure of disarmament, and the public opinion of the world would be amazed and shocked if the final result of the conference were nothing more than an agreement to allow rearmament; another, because I did not think enough weight had been attached to the undertaking given by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the memorandum that they would be prepared to agree to immediate consultation as to the steps to be taken for the purpose of restoring the situation and of maintaining in operation the provisions of the Disarmament Convention in the event of a breach, or the threat of a breach, of that instrument. That seemed to me a most important declaration on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, for I could not imagine that my Government would ever seek to evade the obligation, which, to my mind, was implicit under that undertaking, that, as soon as consultation had shown what steps were to be taken, they would be taken. And, lastly, the Italian memorandum, when I first read it, and the many times I had read it since, remained to me so delicately nebulous that I felt that Herr Hitler and I could draw diametrically opposed conclusions with equal justification.4. As regards the para-military formations, it seemed to me that in this respect Germany, or at least Herr Hitler, had made a considerable step forward. It should not, I thought, pass the wit of man to set up, on the basis of Herr Hitler&apos;s assurances, a system which would satisfy France and Belgium that the SA. and the S.S. were, in fact, militarily innocuous. What I thought was likely to prove a much greater difficulty was the German insistence upon the immediate possession of military aircraft. To my mind Herr Hitler&apos;s argument that German industry could be destroyed by air attack in a few hours, though maybe true enough on paper, and a good debating point, was as fantastic as German fears of aggression. No Power in the world wanted to attack Germany, but many Powers had every reason to fear attack by Germany, if she were strong enough to do so.   I foresaw that Herr Hitler&apos;s demand for an[61 n-2]
Immediate right to the possession of &apos;&apos; defensive &apos;&apos; military aircraft would be fiercely resisted, and as fiercely upheld by Herr Hitler, for the truth was that, to him and to Germany, the possession of military aeroplanes was a matter of national honour and prestige. This was the question which caused me the gravest misgiving at the present moment, for I felt that in other ways Mr. Eden&apos;s tour had been fruitful, and I did not think that any of the other difficulties, great though they were, were insuperable. But I called M. Hymans&apos; attention to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to military aircraft, as laid down in their memorandum, which attitude, so far as I knew, was still firmly held by them to-day. It seemed to me that, on this point alone, the public adherence of the Belgian Government to the British memorandum as a basis of a disarmament convention would be of the greatest value. The more the Germans realised that the other Powers were united in their view that, in the words of the British memorandum, no &quot; party not hitherto entitled to possess military aircraft should claim such possession pending the results of the enquiry &apos;&apos; of the Permanent Disarmament Commission into the possibilities of the complete abolition of naval and military aircraft, the more prospect there was of the German claim being defeated or whittled down to a &quot;token payment.&quot;5. The Minister for Foreign Affairs ended our long conversation by saying that Belgium was in a difficult position, and especially so just now. The Government were beset by internal difficulties and by complications arising out of the death of King Albert, and had to pay particular heed to public opinion. It was because public opinion was ignorant and misled by the press that the Prime Minister had made his deliberately sensational speech on Tuesday last. All Comte de Broqueville had done in reality was to express in direct and forcible language the views which the Belgian Government had long held, and the whole Government were solid with their Prime Minister in his action. But the speech had naturally caused a certain effervescence, and the Government must give the Belgian people a little time to settle down and look at the facts in a calm and reasonable light. Moreover, what the Government, and he himself above all others, must carefully avoid was to do anything which would upset the delicate balance of Belgian (i.e., Walloon and Flemish) opinion in regard to foreign affairs. What I took his Excellency to mean was that, having just given the French Government a nasty shock, the Belgian Government could not follow it up immediately by a second blow, which would be the interpretation put by France on the public expression of Belgian adherence to the principle of the British memorandum. His Excellency gave a strong hint that if the British General Staff were authorised to work with the Belgian General Staff within the frame of Locarno, just as the French General Staff had done, with no formal or definite commitments on either side (see my despatch No. 47, Secret, of the 20th January last), the feeling of security which Belgium would derive therefrom might encourage the Belgian Government to adhere to the British memorandum, which, after all, as I said to M. Hymans, in its general lines corresponds closely to the views held and expressed by Belgian Ministers. Failing such co-operation, I feel that the Belgian Government will not move, except platonically, in the direction desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government. When I pressed M. Hymans for the earliest possible reply, his answer made it fairly clear that we should not get one until the French Government had sent their considered view to His Majesty&apos;s Government, which, incidentally, M. Hymans apparently expected would be next Tuesday. In other words, I assume that M. Hymans is going to consult Paris first.I have, &amp;c.GEORGE R. CLERK.
