I This Document  is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.                                                                   30CP. 15 (28).CABINET.CLAIM  AGAINST  HIS  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT  BY  THE  BASEL    MISSION  TRADING   SOCIETY  IN  CONNECTION  WITH   THEIR    PROPERTIES IN THE GOLD  COAST.      MEMORANDUM BY THE ACTING SECRETAKY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.     IN bringing the following question before the  Cabinet, it is unfortunately necessary for me to give some historical account of it.    For many years prior to the war, there, had been a company called the Soci&amp;ecommerciale des Missions de Basle,  or  &quot; Basel Mission Trading Society,&quot; whichoperated extensively in the Gold Coast and India as general merchants.  This body was formed to support the Evangelical Missionary  Society  known as the Basel Mission, and by its constitution it was limited to paying 5 per  cent, dividends to itsshareholders, anything over that being devoted to the  Basel Mission, after allowing for superannuation funds, and such  matters.  The nominal capital of the Society amounted to  120,000, some of which was held by the Basel Mission, who also had the right to nominate some Directors.  As was natural, the Trading Society drewmost of its personnel from North Switzerland and South Germany.  At the outbreakof war 17 per cent, of the capital was in German hands, the rest being chiefly heldby Swiss.    When war broke  out, the existence of a considerable number of Germans (notGerman-Swiss) belonging  to  the Mission and the Trading Society caused  some anxiety in the mind of the Gold Coast Government, and, accordingly, the  Germanpersonnel and the German Missionaries were deported  to England in 1914-15.  the trading Society then carried on its work  with the aid of Swiss personnel.  Towardsthe middle  of 1915  it became apparent  to His Majesty&apos;s  Representatives inSwitzerland and elsewhere, that the  Basel Mission (not the Trading Society) was an active force in pro-German propaganda,  and continued representations to this effect were made by our diplomatic representatives in  Switzerland, who maintainedstoutly that there was  very little to choose in this respect between the Mission properand the Trading  Society.   The Trading Society &quot;was put on the Black list under our war trade arrangements, but they continued to carry on through the agency of messrs. J. and P. Werner in this country, while efforts were made to form a newmissionary body in Switzerland under French-Swiss direction,  which might replace the Basel Mission in its Evangelical work.  These efforts proved a failure.   Mean-while, the Trading Society had been engaged in a reorganisation, and by November1917, they had bought out all  the German shareholders and  separated themselves from the Basel Mission.   They brought out an entirely new constitution, by which.whilst still maintaining the limit of 5 per cent, dividend, they  bound themselves toapply surplus profits to  &quot;the furtherance, of the Kingdom of  God.&quot; and to placesuch profits in the hands of trustees, who  would be all of Swiss nationality.   In themeantime, however, the position of  foreign Missions in general throughout  theEmpire had  been causing anxiety, and various Interdepartmental Conferences were held in London, as a result of which it was decided that there was no longer sufficient justification  for allowing the Basel Mission and the Basel Mission Trading Societyto continue  their activities in  the Gold  Coast, and that it would be necessary to liquidate the Trading Society and put an  end to the Mission.  On the 7th December.1917, the Governor of the Gold  Coast telegraphed that  in view of  a report that some      117098]                                                       B
of the Swiss employees of the Basel Mission Trading Society in Kumasi had held afestive evening to celebrate  the sinking of the   Apapa &quot; By a German submarine,he had decided to deport all the Swiss employees of the Society, and to place  its business in the hands of the Custodian of Enemy Property.    The situation then, at the end of 1917, was that it had been decided to put anend to the Mission&apos;s operations and  to close down the Trading Society.  similar action was decided upon by India with regard to the property of the Trading Societythere.  The question at once  arose as to what was to be clone with the property of the trading Society,  which amounted in the Gold Coast to a sum estimated at  636.000and in India to about half this sum, including land, buildings and other assets, and making no allowance for goodwill.  In view of the fact that the surplus profits of the trading Society were devoted to philanthropic purposes which were carried out bythe Mission Society, certain  friends of missionary enterprise in this country, amongthe foremost of whom were Mr. Lionel Curtis and  Mr. J.  11. Oldham, the Secretaryof the Conference of  Missionary  Societies, urged  that the  property  sequestratedshould not be treated in the usual way.  The usual course would have been for theproperty to be taken over by  the Custodian and sold by auction to the highest bidder.the proceeds being retained by Government for eventual disposal.  On the conclusionof peace the proceeds of properties of enemy subjects were dealt with in accordancewith the Peace Treaty: property of neutrals, or of firms or individuals, who. as aresult  of the Peace  Treaty,  became  citizens  of  other  than ex-cnemy  countries(c.ff.. Alsace and Ozeeho-Slovakia. &amp;c), was returned to them,  and to the  best of myknowledge this case of the Easel Mission Trading Society is the only one in whichneutral property or the proceeds  thereof has not been returned  to the original owner.    One argument which  was  continually pressed by the philanthropic persons concerned was that the Trading Society did not sell spirits in any of its establish-ments  in the Gold Coast, while any likely purchaser  from  the competing firms inthe West African trade would have been almost certain to refuse such a restriction.    The first attempt at dealing with  the situation was a proposal to form a private company, which was to take over the whole of the Trading Society&quot;s property as it stood, for a cash payment at a valuation, and  carry it on on the same lines, beingcontent with a limited profit, devoting any surplus to  missionary and philanthropicobjects.  This attempt failed for lack of the necessary capital.  These negotiationshaving failed, it was eventually decided,  in November, 1918, to  treat the Societyas an ordinary concern and  sell  its property to the highest bidder. Announcementof this intention evoked immediate protest from representatives of Free Churchorganisations both in Scotland and England, from Mr. J.  H. Thomas,  M.P., whothreatened that the Labour Party would make it  a parliamentary issue, and  fromthe Archbishop of Canterbury.  Mr. Lionel Curtis then put forward a proposal tothe following effect:          &quot; That,  since the  Trading Society was  bound  to limit its  dividends to     5  per cent, and to devote any surplus to  philanthropic objects, and was also     bound, in the event of liquidation, to be content with repayment of its original     share capital ( 120.000) at par, any surplus being handed over for philanthropic     objects,  it was, therefore, proper  to regard it as a Trust, so that the  equities of     the case would  be fully satisfied  if  His Majesty*s Government  repaid to  the     Trading Society their  original nominal capital of  120,000 and retained  the     remainder of the assets for philanthropic objects.  This proposal was put to     the Foreign Office on the 22nd November, 191S (this date, being subsequent to     the armistice, is of some importance), and the Foreign Office advised  that His     Majesty&apos;s Government would  be entitled  to take over all the property of the     undertaking in return for an assurance  to  the  parties in Europe, who had     hitherto controlled it,  that the work would  be carried on on the same  lines,     provided that the Society should  receive a  capital sum sufficient to repay to the     shareholders and bondholders the amount of money which they had contributed.     This  sum would  be  provided out of the cash reserves  which  His Majesty&apos;s    Mr. Curtis&apos;s proposal having thus received the approval of the Foreign Office,steps  were taken  to  carry  it  into  effect, and in view  of the  impending PeaceConference, it was decided that such steps had better be taken with as little delayas possible.   Accordingly, the  Gold  Coast Government was instructed to  pass anOrdinance vesting the property in Trustees, the latter to have power to  hand itover to any approved  commercial undertaking for administration  on the same  lines
 as those followed by the Basel Mission Trading Society.  This was accordingly done, and the gentlemen who had originally been considering the formation of a company to take over the Trailing Soeietyfs property,  proceeded to form another company, called the Commonwealth Trust,&quot; which was to work the properties of the Trading Society, but was to make  no payment to Government in consideration of these properties.  This body was formed  with a working capital  of  60,000, of which some  53,000 has been paid up,  and all the assets in the Gold Coast were  handed over  to them during the early part of 1919.   Similar action was taken in India. In May 1919, the assets in India, which amounted to about half the value of those in the Gold  Coast, were vested in the Custodian of  Enemy Property and were  handed over  to the  Commonwealth  Trust in August 1920, the transfer being validated by Indian legislation.  By the Memorandum and Articles of the Trust, the shareholders are entitled to a cumulative dividend of 5 per  cent, free of tax out of the net profits and the Trust is pledged not to trade in spirits.  Any surplus profits then remaining are payable to Trustees for missionary work in the Gold Coast  and India.     During 1919, the Swiss  Government  protested that the action taken   in thus dealing with the property of the Swiss company  was irregular, and the Trading Society sent a memorandum to the then Secretary  of State for the Colonies with a legal opinion signed  by Sir John Simon  and  others, to the effect that the action taken was contrary  to International Law. The  Trading Society  had refused to accept the 1120.000 offered  to them, lest their doing so should prejudice their case. His  Majestys  Government  continued  to  refuse consideration  on the ground that both  the Basel Mission and the Basel Mission Trading Society,  though nominally Swiss, were to all intents and purposes German,  and that the action taken  in the Gold Coast and  in  India  in treating the concern as a  Trust was abundantly justified.     During 1924. Lord Templetown took  up the case and  proceeded to make rcpre- sentations to the  Secretary of State on  behalf of the Trading Society from the standpoint that they  were a Swiss concern whose  property had been confiscated by His  Majesty&apos;s Government without compensation.   It is unnecessary  to summarise the correspondence,  but Mr. Amery, having  been advised that the action  of  His Majestys Government in handing over the assets of the Basel Company  to the Commonwealth Trust was indefensible, referred  the  matter to  the  present Law Officers of the Crown, who gave their opinion that  the action taken had no justifica- tion under  International Law or custom.   I understand that the proper course to have  adopted was to  sell the property and to  retain the price received,  and on the conclusion of peace to have returned  it &quot;to the Swiss owners.  It is not the action of sequestrating the Trading Society&apos;s profierty that  is in question,.but the fact that, having been  sequestrated, it was handed over to another body without compensation to the original owners.    In the  year 1919, the  Commonwealth  Trust began trading in the  Gold Coast and India.  In India they met with  fair success, and made certain profits.   In the Gold  Coast, on the other hand, a serious slump in trade set in suddenly in 1920 from  which  nearly every firm trading in West Africa suffered losses.  The Common- wealth Trust seems to have been particularly unfortunate, as in five years&apos; trading they made a loss of over  300,000 and had to write off a considerable quantity of the assets received from the Gold  Coast Government, which originally belonged to the Basel Mission Trading Society. I understand, however, that they earned a profit of  11,830  during the year 1927 and that during t*he present year  they expect a fairly substantial profit.    I attach a  copy  of the  case put to the Law Officers and of their opinion, from which it will be seen that their report is to the effect that what had been done  was to seize the property of a national of a friendly State without making full compensa- tion, and that the fact that the  owner had bound himself  to  apply some  of  the property to  charitable purposes did not justify  a State in seizing that property and handing it over to some other party.  They therefore held that the action taken was not justifiable under International law and could not be defended before  a tribunal.    The Society had also operated in  the Cameroons, and during the war  the FrenchGovernment  sequestrated its property. After the war the sequestration was removed and the property returned to the former owners.    In order to meet the situation created by Lord  Templetown&apos;s campaign and  the definite opinion of the Law Officers that the action  taken was. in fact,  unjustifiable, attempts at  a settlement have been made from  time to time.  It appears that there are, in fact, only twro courses  which  can be followed in endeavouring to settle  the      [17098]                                                       B 2
question: one to reinstate the Basel Mission Trading Society in its properties, which involves dispossessing  the  Commonwealth Trust,  and  the other to make a  cashpayment sufficient to compensate the Society for the expropriation of their propertiesand business.  At one time it appeared probable that the directors of the Common-wealth Trust Company would  be willing to recommend the Company to go intovoluntary  liquidation on the  basis of returning to Government their properties andassets less such amount as  would be required to extinguish their share capital andunpaid  interest thereon to  clear them of debt, and to grant some compensation totheir employees. In that case the properties and assets so returned would have been handed  over to the Basel Company.  The Government  of India  were,  prepared toconsider this solution provided that no payment was involved from Indian  revenues.The only liability of His Majesty s Government would then have been to pay to theBasel Trading Society  some sum estimated at something like   50,000  to   100,000to compensate them for the losses sustained by the Commonwealth  Trust in the  gold coast, and since, the Basel Trading Society were willing to accept, on the basis ofrestitution, less than their full claim.  It was  realised that, in view of the terms ofthe Memorandum and  Articles of the Commonwealth Trust,  some legal difficulties would arise in arranging for a liquidation on the above lines, but an investigation ofthe point has not been made,  as lately the attitude  of the Directors of the Trust hasaltered,  and they take the view that the. situation between His Majestys Governmentand the  Swiss has nothing to do with them, while, at an interview, Sir G. Craik andMr. L. Curtis made it  clear that they would require a large sum  as compensation,and that they were, unwilling to abandon their  enterprise.    The other alternative is  to  pay  such  compensation to the Trading Society asthey will accept in settlement. The valuation put forward by them of their property in the Gold Coast is  636.000. which may be accepted as substantially correct.  Inaddition, there is property in India of roughly  about half this sum, so that the  total value of assets seized amounts to, in round figures,   900.000.  There is also a claim for interest and goodwill, bringing the total to well  over  1,000,000. Any such sumcould only be found by the  Imperial Treasury, though the Gold Coast Governmentwould be asked to. assist.  It would, of course, rest with the Government  of Indiato decide the action to be taken in regard to the  properties in India, and the proposal made  below relates  exclusively  to the Gold Coast properties.   It is possible  thatthe claim in respect of the Gold Coast property might be  settled  by an immediatepayment of  400.000 to  500.000, but to  call  upon the tax-payers  of that Colonyto find so large a sum on account of actions which were taken by the Home Govern-ment in 1918 is not practicable, and could not be justified.  There  is a possibilitywhich has been mentioned by  Sir G. Craik and Mr. Curtis, that the  CommonwealthTrust would be  willing to raise  additional capital to the amount of  about  100,000and make this available to assist in a settlement.  In  this  connection it must  beremembered that the Commonwealth  Trust has never paid anything for its assets,but has  been placed, without  any payment or liability on its part, in charge of theformer property of the Basel Trading Society, so that if the Commonwealth Trustis to continue to carry  on  its business it is at  any  rate  equitable  that it should berequired to pay for the property delivered to it.    Meanwhile, a body of shareholders  in the  Commonwealth Trust,  headed  by colonel  J. C. Wedgwood, M.P., and Mr. J. H. Harris, M.P., are not satisfied  withthe situation, and feel that the  Trust should attempt  to come to some arrangement with the Basel Trading Society, or at any rate assist in finding a way out of thedifficulty.  They have accordingly suggested to me  that a Select Committee of  bothHouses &quot;should be set up to consider the whole question, and make recommendations for a settlement.  As the personnel of the Committee they suggest:          Lord Selborne,        Lord Meston,        Lord Templetown,        Sir Robert Hamilton,        Colonel Wedgwood, and        A Conservative Member, preferably one with legal qualifications.These names are not my suggestion, and if it is  decided to set up the proposed SelectCommittee. I presume  that the  suggestions of the whips in both Houses will  boobtained as to the  most suitable  personnel  under  the  circumstances.   ColonelWedgwood and  Mr.  Harris have informed  me that the Basel Trading Society would welcome the setting up of such a Committee, and would agree to abide by its findings,
though there is no sort of undertaking to that effect.  If the Society would agree toaccept the findings of the Committee, 1 consider that it would offer the best solutionof the difficulty.  The Terms of Reference to such a Committee should,  I think, bewide  enough to permit them to consider the position of the Commonwealth Trust,and to advise what ought in fairness to be done with that body, in the events whichhave happened.  The reason for this is that it seems to me unreasonable that theCommonwealth Trust  having  received  all  its  assets  (except  the  share capitalsubscribed)  free from  His Majesty&apos;s Government for the furtherance of certainwork, should insist on retaining all those assets and continuing the work even thoughit is now clear that a mistake was made, and that the work could conveniently oeabandoned.  I suggest  then  that the Terms of Reference of the Committee, which,as I have stated  above, would  relate exclusively  to the Gold Coast,  should  be asfollows:         &quot; To  consider and report upon the actions taken by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-    ment  in 1918 in relation to the Basel Mission Trading Society  in  the Colony    of the Gold Coast;        To consider the circumstances which led to the formation of the Common-    wealth Trust: and to consider the  general position of that Company;        To advise whether any, and if so what, action should be taken to terminate    that Company&apos;s existence, upon what terms; and        To report generally upon the steps which should be taken to bring  about    a settlement of the questions now in  dispute:&quot;and I request approval to the proposal to set up a Committee accordingly.                                                                  W. 0.-G.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,         January 25, 1928.APPENDIX.      COPY OF THE CASE PUT TO THE LAW OFFICERS AND OF THEIR OPINION.                        Colonial Office to Law Officers.X 2392/26.Gentlemen,                                Downing Street, February 26, 1926.    I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to invite your attention to the followingmatter.    2.  Prior to the war there was in the Gold Coast a missionary body called &quot; TheBasle Mission,&quot; which owned churches and sehools  and carried  on missionaryenterprise generally.  The Head Office of the Mission was at Basle, Switzerland, butthe Directorate was very pro-German, as was a large number of the missionariesin the Gold Coast.   Associated with the Mission was a body called &quot;The  BasleMission Trading Society,&quot; which appears to have been in the nature of a  companyregistered at Basle.    3.  One-fifth of its capital was held by the Mission,  who could also nominate  acertain  number of Directors.  By its constitution  it had to pay 5 per cent, on itscapital to the shareholders and to pay the balance of its profits to the Basle MissionFor missionary work.   The shares were held by  persons of  various nationality,about 6 per cent, being held  in  Germany and  11 per cent, by  Germans  living inSwitzerland.  The  Society  engaged  in  general  trading1 operations in  the  gold coast. India, China and anywhere where the Mission  operated, and its operations were  very  successful.   Certain  of the  directors and staff of the  Society wereGermans.  On the outbreak  of war  most of the missionaries in  the Gold Coastwere  interned and subsequently deported.   The Trading Society, being staffed tosome extent by Swiss nationals, carried on, the German employees being weeded out and interned.
    4.  So matters continued  from 1914 to 1917, although  representations were constantly being received to the effect that the &quot; Basle Mission &quot; was a thoroughlyGerman body, but it is noteworthy that at this time a clear distinction  was seldomdrawn between the Mission and the Society.  During 1917 the Society got  rid ofits German capital and prepared a new constitution which was finally approved inNovember, 1917.  Under this the Society was not bound to the Basle Mission, but their surplus profits were to be devoted to &quot; the furtherance of the Kingdom of God.&quot;A copy of the constitution is enclosed.    5.  About this time the Governor of the Gold  Coast recommended that thebusiness of the Society there should be wound up on the ground of enemy association,and more particularly because  some of  the staff were alleged  to have shown activepro-German sympathy.  After some hesitation the Governor&apos;s proposal was accepted and the business was wound up under  Chapters 190 and  193 of the Laws  of theGold Coast Colony, copies of which are enclosed.    6.  Mr.  Amery does not anticipate that any question will arise with  regard tothe winding  up of the Society&quot;s business, since the concern was certainly  of enemyassociation, but he is concerned about the validity in international law of the actionwhich was taken subsequently with reference to the assets of the Society.    7.  In the ordinary course of events under a liquidation, the shops,  tradingstations and other property of the Society would have been sold and  the proceedslodged with  the Controller of Enemy Property:  and  at the end of the war. if theSociety had turned out to be legally German, credited through the Clearing Office,or if  it had  turned out to be legally Swiss,  returned  to it.  Strong representations were, however, made to the Secretary of State that if the properties were sold theywould fall into the hands of commercial firms who would, among other things, sellliquor in  the Trading Society&apos;s shops,  and further that the  work of the Missionwould be at  an end and the goodwill irretrievably  lost.  It was suggested that theSociety could be regarded as operating  a trust for the benefit of the Basle mission and  that  its assets could  be  regarded as impressed  with  that  trust,  and thata proper course would be to pay to the shareholders of the Society the amount oftheir holdings and to convey the rest  of the assets  to  trustees to perpetuate the trust.  The argument as to the  propriety of this course is conveniently stated in the note of the 11th February. 1919. from the Foreign Office to the Swiss Minister, ofwhich a copy is enclosed.*    8.  This policy was eventually carried out.  A company called &quot;The Common-wealth Trust&quot; was formed for  the purpose of carrying on the business  of the trading Society in the Gold Coast and the necessary steps were taken to complete the arrangements by the passing of Ordinance No.  40  of 1918 (Chapter 69) andthe execution of  a deed of trust.  Copies of the Memorandum and Articles of theCommonwealth Trust, Limited, of the trust deed and of Chapter 69 of the Laws ofthe Gold Coast are enclosed.*     9.  The Society has never accepted the position and  the case which it makesupon the  matter will be found in  the  volume of printed  correspondence which  isenclosed.*     10.  There is some reason to suppose that the  whole question may be raised bythe Swiss Government, who would, doubtless, ask for arbitration.  Mr. Amery is notat all anxious to  disturb the existing position if the action  which has been takencan be defended under the provisions of international law.  Otherwise it is proposedto try to  effect some  sort of settlement, but no settlement would be possible which did  not involve  the dispossession  of  the  Commonwealth Trust.  I  am  to ask,therefore, that you  will be so good as to advise whether the  action  taken under chapter 69 of the Laws of the Gold Coast  and the trust deeds with respect to the assets of  the Basle Mission Trading Society is  justifiable under international law.and could be defended with a reasonable prospect of success before an  international tribunal.                                                         I am, &amp;c.                                                             C.  STB AC HEY.* These.documents are not reproduced.
X  -2722/2(5.                         Opinion of the Lair Officers.    We have taken the matter  into our consideration, and  in  obedience to yourcommands have the honour to REPORT    That in our opinion international law in the sense in which the expression is used in the present instructions is really no more than the customary usage whichprevails between sovereign States and has no legal sanction.  It would be necessaryin  any  arbitration to define with precision the question submitted to any tribunal and the rules by which it was to be guided.    In the case under  consideration  the Governor of&quot; the Gold Coast  has in effectconfiscated the property of a Swiss Company and handed it over to another jjerson.It  is not  in accordance with international usage to seize property of a national ofa friendly State without making full compensation to the owner; and the fact thatthe owner had  bound  himself to apply some part of his property to charitablepurposes does not. in our opinion, justify a State in seizing that property and givingit to someone else to use for one of the charitable purposes in cpicstion.    Our answer to the question propounded is. therefore, in the negative.                                           DOUGLAS  McGAREL HOGG.                                           T.  W. H. INSKIP.
