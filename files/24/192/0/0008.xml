l.-The Character of the Relief.    1.   AT  this stage in the life of Parliament  we should survey  our financial policy  as a whole.  By  resinning the gold  standard we havehelped  the  merchant,  the  hanker and above all the  consumer;  byremitting sixpence upon the  income lax we have,  benefited the generaltaxpayer  and  especially the rentier ;  by the. Widows&apos; and  Old  age pensions  Acts we  have given a  new and  most important security to the wage-earner.  But so far we have done nothing for the producer on whosecontinued vitality  the heart-beat of the nation depends.    2.  It must he recognised that a further  reduction in income tax  isnot justifiable in  the present state of  the National  Debt, and  would,moreover, bo regarded in all the  circumstances as a  class  measure.A reduction of  the  Beer Duty, which would  carry far-reaching benefits to the  economy of  a  great number of  working-class  homes,  is  notattractive to an electorate which  for the first time in world history  will comprise a majority of women.  Accordingly at Whitsuntide I proposedto the Prime Minister that the final effort of our finance in the present parliament   should  be devoted  to aiding the  hard-pressed   producer,manufacturing and agricultural, and especially the basic producer, who isthe most hard pressed.    3.  The advocacy of a general system of  protection for home manu-faotures and home-produced  food  would divide the country upon linesmuch  less  advantageous  to  the Conservative Party than the presentcleavage between  Socialism  and anti-Socialism.   To give  protection  tothe manufacturer while denying it: to the farmer vitiates the logic of the argument.  Agriculture, which is still the main industry of the island,will never tolerate manufacturing protection without being itself includedin the tariff.  The vast additions to the consuming vote contemplated inthe female franchise seem in themselves conclusive against the policy ofprotective taxation of food.   That has been found  electorally  impossible in the past; it will be doubly impossible in the future.    4.  There is a profound  difference  between conferring  favours uponproducers at the expense or alleged expense of the consuming  population and relieving producers  from undue, exceptional and invidious burdens.The long successes of Liberalism in the lUth  century in the political andeconomic sphere were due to the fact  that their policy consisted mainly in striking  oft&apos; out-worn fetters on the enterprise and growing manhood ofthe nation.  The relieving of the producers from their present  oppression by antiquated laws constitutes  almost the only remaining large  task of liberation within  the reach of  Governments in these days.  It is to this task that we should now address ourselves.
    5.  Our system   of  national  finance  is revised  and  refined  byParliament every year and probably the  immense sums required by theState are  raised on the  whole in the least burdensome  manner.  our system  of  local rating, on  the other hand, stands substantially on the foundation  of  the Kith  Century, since  when all  economic  facts  have changed entirely.   Under this old system  productive industry of every kind  suffers an excessive and  injurious oppression.   The burden  fallsmost  severely  upon  the  heavy  produce&quot;-.   The  more  plant  and  real property he has to use for his business, and consequently the more labourho employs, the more he is penalised.  The ratio of rates to profits in the table  printed in Appendix A shows how seriously the irrelevant accidentof a man having  to use  bulky tools and  extensive  premises  to earn  a living  exposes  him   to  invidious  local   taxation.   Moreover,   therates, unlike the  income tax, are levied even when  no  profit is made.They  vary  at  different   times  and  in  different  parts of  the country,thus handicapping businesses which ought to have an equal  chance oneconomic merits.  They are dependent upon the caprice of local elections,and their burden  grows  heavier  with  the increasing difficulties of thebusiness and the increasing poverty of the  district in  which it  is carriedon.   Finally, the heavy  basic industries which suffer the  most, are thevery industries which have the greatest responsibilities  in the  employ-ment  of the people, are  most directly in contact with labour discontent,are most unsheltered from  foreign competition, most markedly  chargedwith  our elaborate social services, and principally affected by the  highand uneconomic wages which prevail  in the sheltered transport  trades.                     U.-The Hcopc of the Relief.    (&apos;).  The  primary object  of  the  present  plan is to  accord  to allproducers a large and ultimately complete relief  from rating in respect ofall property used for the manual and mechanical processes of production.starting  from  the  winning of the  natural supplies  and  including  thevarious stages  of transport and conversion culminating in the finished  -article of commerce.  It is not suggested that producers should be placedin any preferential  position over other ratepayers  in  regard to  propertystill generally rateable;  in so  far as they occupy residential accommoda-tion. ofliees, sale-rooms, garages, etc., they will  continue to be assessed asat present.   On the other  hand,  premises used  for gainful  productivepurposes will enjoy relief even when  occupied  by public authorities orcharitable institutions.    The definition of  productive purposes can obviously  be drawn invarious ways.   In the present  plan we have adopted  a provisionaldefinition,  printed  in Appendix B, which includes not only agriculture,mines,  mills,  factories, workshops, etc., but  also  such public  utilityservices as railways, canals, docks,  and the supply of power,  light and    (&apos;6933)                                                        H 2
heat,  the cost of which represents  a very considerable element in  thetotal  cost of production.  It is  suggested, however,  that the mutuallycomplementary  services  of  water supply and  drainage should remainrateable and that the transport services operating upon  the public  high-wajr should continue to contribute directly to its upkeep.  Out of a totalof over  175 millions now paid in rates, it is estimated that rather morethan  one-fifth say   38 millions is  being  paid on  property comprisedwithin the definition.                       Ill.-The Effect of the Relief.      7.   Appendix  C gives some  information which has been collected on  various occasions by the Board of Trade, Inland Revenue and others as  to the burden  of  rates on  firms  in  different  industries.  These figures  mainly relate to the direct and individual  effects, but indications are also  given as to the  cumulative effect in certain cases.  Tho direction in which  the relief given  to the Railways will  operate is largely within our control  and  we can use  it  to  increase  the  cumulative  relief on the  basic  industries.  We should in  the  first place  bargain  with the Railways  that if they  are  allowed   into  the  scheme  they should give an  immediate and equivalent relief  to  heavj&apos;  freight traffic on  their  lines.  In the present  bad system  the  railways, finding commercial lorries and  &apos;buses picking the plums of inland transportation, have little  choice but  to recoup themselves upon the heavy traffic  which  cannot  escape the  railroads.    Like many  other  people in  this country they &quot;take it out  of the basics.&quot;   The relief  which  the  railways  would  be  required to  accord  to heavy traffic in return for the quite exceptional advantages they  will receive could be settled by an agreement  subsequently regulated by  the Railway Rates  Tribunal.  The  immediate relief in rates  to the  railways (apart  from  their satisfaction with other parts of the  plan to  be discussed later) would amount to not  less than  4,000,000  a year.  They ought  to  be made to pay the whole of this in relieving  freights.  and  particularly heavy freights, agricultural  and industrial,  and  seek  their own  advantage in the greater traffic of a more prosperous nation.      Cheaper freights  woidd  help  Coal, Ore, Limestone,  etc.,  already  helped in themselves.   These products when  they  arrive at the  Steel  Works will be winged with  a proportion at least  of the savings due to  their  own relief and to  cheaper  transport.   Therefore  the relief upon  the ton of steel is not measured  by its direct relief from rating;  there  is added to it  all that has  been gathered before.   These  cumulative  effects increase as the qualitative scale of  production is  mounted.   The  steel plate arrives at the shipyard  potentially cheaper.   It finds  there  the shipyard already relieved  of local charges on its plant and premises;  and so on.   We shall in fact  enter  upon a virtuous  instead of a vicious  circle and the propensity will throughout be beneficial and not injurious.
o59    8.  My colleagues who for so many years have been deeply concerned about the state of Industry and Unemployment  will see how this treat-ment of the problem brings into  action all  those powerful argumentsabout  native  industry and  employment, about the adverse balance  oftrade and the so-called &quot;Dole,&quot; which  are so much  in the  public mind.These arguments could now be deployed with local illustrations in every part of the country, in every class  of  business, in every firm  and in everyconstituency.  But they would  not encounter as  in the case of a Pro-tective Tariff the  vast traditional  organised school  of opinion  and theperilous  political reactions  mentioned  in a previous paragraph.  It can1 think be shown that the lightening of rates on the Producer would havethe effect both upon home industry and export trade of a, moderate scientifictariff; but  without raising  any of its  antagonisms.   It may be possiblelater to compute the ad valorem equation.    9.  We may now consider the effect of these proposals upon what are called the &quot; necessitous areas.&quot;  We must  not  expect  that they willsolve the problem of derelict Welsh mining valleys.  But taking  not onlythe officially described &quot;necessitous  areas&quot; but also hard-pressed areaslike the  Tync, the  Clyde and the  Thames, it would appear that the reaction would  be highly beneficial.    Under our present arrangements,  when the industries  of a districtHag, unemployment, distress and pauperism increase and  to meet them the rates are  raised.   These higher  rates aggravate the  trouble of thefailing industries and more unemployment results.  The miseries of theworking  class  are   the  fertile  breeding-ground  of  what  is  called&quot; Poplarism  ;  and   a virulent  Socialist and  pauperising propagandaarises.   What  with   the ever  growing burden of  the  rates and  thepoisonous atmosphere created, industry flies from these districts, or dieswithin them.  Who would start a factory in West Ham ?  On  the contrary,everywhere we see industries shifting outside heavily rated  areas, startingafresh at needless  capital outlay in grass meadows without population  orcommunications.   They then demand motor roads to bring at uneconomicexpense  workmen to the  scene and  to deliver their products.  Theydemand  new houses  subsidised by  the  State  for a  new  community.Frequently  we see  the factory  erected  just  outside the  municipalboundaries  to  escape from  being made a starveling milch cow.  Thewhole impulse  is  for industry  to  quit the  melancholy areas and leavebehind them political agitation, State  assistance  and  a forlorn mass  of derelict humanity.    Two things  drive industry away  from  the  necessitous or  hard-pressed areas.  First, the high rates consequent upon poverty ; secondly,Poverty&apos;s child Socialist spite.  We can deal with the first, and when wehave dealt with the  first the second will gradually cure itself.  Man  is naturally sensible and friendly if you  give him half a chance.  And after all, many of these necessitous  areas, but for rates, pauperism and their
political  consequences, would be quite good  places for old establishedbusinesses to thrive  and even  for  new ones to be founded.   Here it isthat the working population have  their homes, their institutions, theirschools,  their churches, their recreations,  their small  shops,  their gasand water.  How much better to bring industry back to  the necessitousareas than  to disperse their  population at enormous expense and wasteas one would from a  plague-stricken or  malarious  region!   Enough hasbeen said upon this subject  to indicate the outlines of the argument.                     \V.-The Finance of the Relief.    10.  The cost of  complete relief  from rates of productive property as defined above has, for the purpose of working out  a scheme, been taken as  38,000,000, to which  should be  added not less  than  3,000,000 forthe purpose as will presently be explained of negotiating on favourable terms with the local  authorities, total  -11,000,000.   How to find such agigantic sum ?    11.  The first essential is that  the Budget of 1928 should balancenaturally.   It  would  be regrettable and  harmful  if  in  the  existing situation we were forced to impose  new taxation merely for the purposeof paying our way.  We ought at least  to  live upon our actual  income and make both ends meet by economy.  This task, though difficult, is by no means impossible provided a resolute effort  is made in minor ways byall Departments of State.   1 assume therefore for the purposes of further argument that  this  result  is  substantially achieved   by  the Cabinet.I assume also that  there  will be  no  sudden and utterly unexpectedcollapse of the Income Tax.    12.  The revenue must next be  strengthened (not for the purposes ofnew expenditure  but for a transference of burdens)  by a new tax on imported  Liquid Fuel.  It is  the only great simple new indirect tax now available.  This tield  is fertile.  A fiat  specilic duty of 3d. a  gallon onLiquid Fuel should  produce  15 millions out of  a full  18 millions ifimposed in  the  Budget of 1928,  19  millions in 1929, and  thereafterincrease by  1 million a year for as long as we can see.    At this stage and for the purposes of this discussion I  assume  thatthe  Liquid  Fuel  Tax  will  take this simple form.   It falls  upon thebuoyant pleasure  motor vehicles of every class, upon commercial  motor transport, upon an innumerable variety of  private and trade oil engines,upon the lighting of  public places and in a small degree upon the lamp ofthe  cottager.  Nevertheless, so wide  is the  scope and so  low is theproposed duty that, except  for the lowest grades (gas oil and fuel oil), itdoes not seem that it would prove vexatious or injurious.   The price ofall varieties of oil has fallen substantially in the last two or three years,especially petrol, which  shows a reduction of 5d. a gallon and the feature
of over production which  has brought about this fall is still  evident.   Inthe case of the heavy oils, I am considering adjustments which, withoutdetracting materially from the simplicity  of  the tax would adjust theburden  in these eases to  provide for  national  needs while giving somestimulus to refining in this country.  A minor concession on sugar is alsounder  examination  by  way of compensation to the cottager  for the Id.or so a week extra that he might have to pay for his lamp oil.   This,incidentally, would have favourable reactions on the sugar refiner.    18.  The  effects of this tax will of course be especially beneficial tofwo of  our greatest industries, viz., Coal and  Railways,  and  it will  be viewed  with general favour not only  by the employers but by the great mass of coal miners and ntilwaymen.   The lax  would have- a  protectiveeffect as.  following  good  precedents,  no  countervailing excise would  be levied  on  home-produced  shale  oil  or  upon  oil  distilled  from coal.Although  the rate of tax is so low that  it cannot be said to make oildistilled from  coal a commercial proposition immediately, the  gap  wouldbe narrowed, and a stimulus pro tanto afforded  to all forms of scientifictreatment  of  coal, liquid  or  pulverised.    It   is only  possible heie  to mention these reactions.    14.  Armed with this new fiscal weapon we can deal  with the Ratesupon  producers.   The case  of agriculture  is special.  Farmers havealready been relieved of 75 per cent, of the rates on  hind and buildings and if the further relief is to have any considerable economic and political effect in their case, it is impossible to stop short at complete exemption.They  will, of  course, continue to  be  rated as now on their  residential property, and  one need have  no fear that they will  cease to take a keeninterest in enforcing economy in their local administration.    Non-agricultural producers will be invited to exchange  their presentburden  of local  rates  for a   contribution to  the  Imperial  Exchequerrepresenting in the aggregate  slightly more than  one-third the weight&apos;( 13 millions).   This  contribution  would best bo  secured  by  a  taxupon profits:  where there was no profit, there would be no tax.  The tax would  not be a factor in the cost of production ;  and  thus those industriesfacing  the greatest difficulties, working on the smallest margin, bearing the greatest burden  of Rates, employing the largest number of workmenwould throughout gain the greatest advantage.    Much study  has been expended upon a so-called  Profits Tax, and noinsuperable technical difficulties  in  levying   it need  be apprehended.Nevertheless,  I have decided to discard  the plan of  a. Profits Tax.   Itwould be a new tax, or rather a dug-up embodiment of the lately repealedCorporation Profits Tax.   Manufacturers  would be  afraid that once re-imposed, even on a small  scale, it might he used in bad hands as a  meansof  extortion.   The  process  of passing  it through  the House  would
constitute  an onerous  feature of the Finance Bill, and  would tend  torivet attention upon the less pleasing aspects of the policy.    Instead of remitting the whole of the Rates in exchange for a profits tax  equal  to one-third  of  them in  the aggregate, the relief  might  belimited to two-thirds in the first instance.  Instead of saying. &quot;We willlet you off all your Rates in exchange for a Profits Tax,&quot; we could saysimply, &quot;We will let you off  two-thirds  of your Rates.&quot;  We should  bepresenting a somewhat  smaller rose, but without a thorn.    But it  would  be a poor way of working merely to leave  upon the producer one-third of his Rates as at present  levied.   The uncertainty ofwhat the Rates woidd be, the disparities  between districts, the high Ratesof the necessitous areas, the uncertainty of  new assessments, the penaltyof new and higher assessments for every  improvement or extension of thebusiness all  in  fact of  the  vices and  anomalies, which  it is a funda-mental part of the policy to denounce  and remedy, would  be left reducedonly in scale.  Our arguments would be to a considerable extent stultified,and  clear presentation  would  be confused.  I accordingly reject  this alternative also in favour of a plan  which embodies the advantages ofthe Profits  Tax  in  its  uniformity, certainty and generous relief to themore  oppressed areas,  while  it  avoids   its  complications and  political objections.    15.  It  is proposed  that, in lieu of the rates of which they are relieved,the non-agricultural producers shall pay to the  Exchequer a NationalRate assessed on the reduction  in  the  rateable value  of their propertygranted to them in the  datum year  1928, and of an amount sufficientat the  outset to  produce  the required MIS millions-probably about/-  in  the M.   Neither  the  5/- rate  nor  the datum year assessments  onwhich  it is  based will be alterable from  year to yea)-, except on  ad hocappeals in respect of property whose rateable value is claimed by theowners to have declined.  As, however, it is intended that the retentionin principle of one-third of the Rates is in itself only to be a temporary expedient for the first  one or two five-year  periods,  no new property orextensions of old property will be the subject of new assessments or berequired to bear any charge.   Thus all complications and deterrents uponindustry arising from the uncertainty of local rate increases or of newassessments on extensions or new businesses, will be eliminated.   Allnon-agricultural  producers  will pay at the same  rate in  all parts of thecountry, and the maximum of relief will be  afforded to the most heavilyrated areas.    16.  The timing of the  new national incomings  and outgoings iscardinal.   The Liquid Fuel  Tax  must, if the  Cabinet approves thescheme, be imposed in the Budget  of  1928, yielding in that year  15millions.  This sum will be  carried forward  in a  Suspensory Fund.  Itwould not anyhow be possible, on account of the needed  Rating  Bill,  to
bring the scheme into operation  before  the second  rate  payment of thofinancial year 1929, Lc, October.  The passage and bringing into force ofthe  necessary rating legislation and  the life of  the  Parliament aretherefore both within our control and simultaneously affected.     17.  On the basis that the Liquid Fuel Tax  is imposed this yearand  its proceeds are  accumulated  in a Suspensory Fund, and that thefirst  payments of rating  relief do  not  begin  till  October  1929, thefinance of the whole scheme is  according to my estimates  solvent and self-contained up to the year 1933  inclusive.  The  following table shows the out-turn year by year for the next six years: Receipts.Year.L.P. Tax.   Nat. Hate &apos; Sched. !).*Interest.    . j Payments.Total. !Surplus 4-   or Deficit - on Year.suspensory  Fundat end of  Year.192819291930193119321933 &quot;&apos;151920212223 65131313130-5203 03 0 ,,,0-3   15-307 I 26207 I 34-20-5 I 36-5    10-30238339-2  1.120-541 Q41041041-0+ 15-34- 57- 4-5- 27- 18152114 9 7 5-3 0-o-7 0-2    * Rates are a legal deduction from the computation of profits for assessment of IncomeTax under Schedule D.  A proportion of the burden is therefore already borne by the State andthe new charge upon the Exchequer is diminished accordingly.     I think it is right to present  such a definite  financial forecast for alarge new scheme.   But even were the forecast less satisfactory, I should look confidently forward to the normal growth  of revenue through theexpansion  of population and  wealth,  and to the  increased yield of our existing taxation  through the   revival  of  trade prosperity  and  the disappearance of the dead weight of unemployment which it is the objectof these proposals to promote.     18.  Lest it be thought this scheme can be introduced in instalmentsor dallied  with, I now  point  out  that all  turns upon the imposing  ofthe Liquid Fuel Tax in the coming Budget.  It is only through theSuspensory Fund  created in  advance  by the  Liquid  Fuel  Tax  thatthe finance of  the scheme will balance.   On the other hand I  cannotintroduce  the  Liquid Fuel Tax merely  for  the purpose of paying our    (16933)                                                          c
way or increasing the revenue, without  announcing at the  same timethe reliefs which are in prospect.   Under  the present time  table the extra taxation will be imposed and got out of the way this year ; and the much larger  reliefs  will very  nearly  synchronise with the end  of the parliament, and  will either have been  actually accorded or be  withingrasp at the moment  of the General  Election.  Obviously it would befoolish to impose the  Liquid Fuel Tax  in  1929 and have  all that rowgoing on with the certainty that no relief  could be given by the authorityof the present Parliament, and the uncertainty whether we should be ina position to give it in the  next.  It  is  therefore now or never for theplan, and the Budget date is zero hour.                  V. The  Distribution of the Relief.    19.  So far I  have dealt with the scheme as affecting the producerwho obtains the relief and the Exchequer which has ultimately to providethe necessary funds.  Between  these  two stand the Local authorities who in the aggregate will  sustain  a loss  in  local rates  of  about  38millions,  receiving instead  from  national  funds  a larger revenue of 41  millions  in  a  new form.   The  various  important  and difficult questions which arise in connection with the local government aspects ofthe scheme are discussed in  some detail  in the  Treasury  memorandumattached hereto.  (Appendix D).  But the argument here passes beyondthe Treasury sphere  into that of the Ministry of Health  and, to a smallerextent, into that of the Ministry of Transport.    In the  sphere of  the Ministry  of Health, the Government is deeply committed to a scheme of Poor Law Reform which seeks to sweep awaythe evils and  waste of the present  small disjointed, conflicting andoverlapping areas.  Mr. Neville Chamberlain has  prepared his plans.  to commend these plans  to the local authorities  two or  threatened-ee  millions ayear from the Exchequer would be needed; but even  so it is doubtfulwhether  such a Bill in isolation would be sufficiently above inertia andlocal jealousies to be  good politics  in  the immediate  parliamentary situation.   The  Treasury,  no  less than the Ministry of  Health, are anxious that advantage shall be taken of any measure  for  the improve-ment of  the  Poor Law, to come to terms with  the  local authorities andto begin  the  reform  of the relations between local and national taxationby introducing a considerable  instalment of the General  Block grants scheme.    The  Ministiy of Transport is faced with an ever-growing demand for more aid to hard-pressed rural  authorities, while it  is anxious to securegreater efficiency  and economy in the maintenance of our highway system by  concentrating  the  administration in the  hands  of   the  Countyauthorities.    Both  Departments  are faced  with  almost  insuperableobstacles  in  the  parochialism of the existing authorities and the unfor-
 Innate financial reactions of either scheme when taken  alone.   The present scheme incorporates the aims and plans of the two Departments in one indivisible whole; and, as explained in the Treasury memorandum, it provides powerful arguments, both political and financial, which should suffice to overbear the forces which have hitherto obstructed these reforms.     20.  These questions of Local Government  Reform are of course the peculiar responsibility  of  the Minister  of Health.   While I understand that he is in  sympathy with a  great  part  of  tho present  scheme, I have not  as yet been  able to  reach  complete agreement with  him on  certain important  questions  of principle.   In the  Treasury view a mere  proportionate  reduction  of the   present  Rates  on  Industry, on  the  lines of  that  conceded  to Agriculture in the  past, with an Exchequer grant to make good the loss, could not lead to a  satisfactory permanent settlement.  The history of  agricultural rates is an  object lesson.  It began in 1S90 with a half reduction of the rates on land and a fixed grant of the immediate loss  sustained  by  local Authorities.   The second phase was reached  in  1923 with  a further relief of a quarter of  the full assessment  and  a  new grant to make good the loss,  this time a variable grant changing with the  actual loss from year to year. The third  phase is already appearing  in the resolutions passed by the Agricultural  Committee  of the House of Commons and other bodies interested  in agriculture, demanding the  complete  exemption  of agri- cultural land from all Rates,  and of  course another grant to make good the  loss.   All these grants have been sops, and not a vestige of reform has  been  achieved for the heavy expenditure involved.   Even  had it been consistent  with the  underlying principles  of the present scheme to leave industrial enterprise still  subject, though in a reduced measure, to the  uneconomic,  uncertain  and  unequal burden of   local rates,  a compensatory grant from the Exchequer on the lines of the Agricultural Rates Act of 1923 woidd be unsound.  The Exchequer woidd find, itself paying a percentage  of the  expenditure  in every  rating area in  the country, the percentage varying between wide limits but on no systematic basis, the  highest  proportion being given as a rule where the forces making for economical  government are least developed.   Such a result would be, alike from the national aud local Government  standpoints, a veritable disaster.     The  argument  that if  industrial  property is relieved from  all contribution to local rates, the influence which manufacturers, etc., exertin local affairs will pro tanto be diminished, would apply for what it isworth  even more to  a  scheme on Agricultural  Rates  Act lines.   the producers indeed would  have been removed, wholly  or partly, from  the zone of uncertainty and extortion.   But  in their place  the  exchequer would  be invited to assume the function of milch cow, and  of a milchcow  of almost  unlimited capacity.  I would therefore  rather  see  thescheme abandoned than expose the  Exchequer to such perils.    (16933)                                                      c 2
    Personally I doubt (and  such information as I have been able togather confirms me in my doubts) whether producers, other than farmers,do in fact exercise any considerable influence on local affairs, especially inthose areas in  which the  forces  making  for  extravagant  expenditureon  social services are most powerful.   The  industries  have virtually no  voting  power.   But in  the  last  resort,  they  can threaten  inprotest against  extravagance to quit  the  district,  costly though  sucha  removal  may be.   Some  substitute  for this  albeit   despairingcheck must be devised, and  a substitute which shall operate  at a much earlier  point  in  the progress  of local  extravagance.   The present scheme  contemplates that  for  the  Rates   hitherto  received  from industrial  property, a new  form  of  revenue  in  the shape  of a block grant  revised  only at five-yearly intervals shall  be substituted. Atthe outset the actual loss in  each ai-ca would  be made good; no LocalAuthority woidd  be worse off; but any extra revenue given to ease thepassage of the new7 scheme and to provide for further development of social services, in addition to the revenue which is to  take the place ofthe percentage and other discontinued grants, would be fixed accordingto general considerations and be independent of local expenditure.   Thussuch spasmodic influence  as producers  may have  been able to exert on local administration would  give place  to the more powerful, direct and continuing  pressure  of   the  local electors, who  would  experience  in greater measure  than at present the ill-effects of extravagant administra-tion and on the other hand  enjoy in greater degree the fruits of thriftymanagement.    21.  It will be observed, however,  from the Treasury memorandum(Appendix  D)  that, to achieve a satisfactory distribution of new revenueon this basis, wider areas  of administration for poor relief and roads are essential; and the  whole policy is therefore intermingled with reformswhich  the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Transport have longhad in mind.  There can  be no such favourable opportunity for achievingthese reforms as is offered by the present proposals.    But if this  opportunity is to be used  to  the  best  advantage, the temptation  to  proceed  with  the  measures  of  relief by themselves,while leaving to  a later date the difficult questions of Local GovernmentReform,  must be resisted.  Under such conditions  we should pay theprice and never get the reforms.    22.  The  following would appear  to be the necessary sequence ofevents: First, the imposition of the Liquid Fuel Tax in  the Budget of1928, so as to  begin the accumulation of the Suspensory Fund; secondly,if the relief is to operate  from October 1929, a Bill must be passed this summer providing for an apportionment of the rateable value in each area between property which is under the scheme to cease to be rateable locally,
1363and other property.   This apportionment of the valuation is estimated torequire twelve months to carry through.   These arc the urgent matters.    It will also be necessary some time before October 1929 for legislation to be  passed:  (a) altering the basis of rating industrial  property  and providing for a levy of  a national  rate  to  be paid with  the proceeds of the   liquid Fuel Tax to  the central fund;  (b)  abolishing  the systemof Assigned  Revenues to clear the way for the Block Grants scheme ofthe Ministry of  Health; (c)  providing for the new distribution of therevenue  from the  central fund  to  make good the deficiencies in localrevenues due to the exemption of  industrial  property and also to providethe new Block Grant;  (d) carrying through the Ministry of Health&apos;s schemeof Poor  Law Reform, including the adoption  of the County and CountyBorough as the future areas of administration ; and (c)  transferring fromthe District Councils to the County Councils the  responsibility for high-ways other than residential streets.  As  long  as the  legislation adopting the County basis for  poor  relief  and rates  is on the  Statute Book by october 1929, there is no insuperable objection to the relief  provisions ofthe scheme being allowed to operate as from that date, although a further period  may elapse before  the actual administration of  so complicateda  service as the  Poor  Law  can  in fact  be   handed over to the new authorities.    It  may, however,  be pointed out that after the unfolding  of the fidlprogramme in  the next Budget, the Government would  always be in  astrong  tactical  position for dealing with any obstructive measures in  theHouse  of Commons or challenge by the Opposition.  At any time it couldinterrupt its legislative programme and  appeal to the country on  thewhole scheme for the relief of  rates and for the abolition of agriculturalrates,  throwing  upon  the  Opposition  the  responsibility  for  the postponement of the promised benefits.                         VI. United Action.    23.  We all feel in the concluding phase of this Parliament the lack ofany constructive and comprehensive plan for  dealing with clamant  social problems.  Five or six  Departments of  State have been  making inde-pendently their contributions.   The Ministry of Health seek to deal withPoor Law reform, and at the same time to grapple with the problemwdiich  confronts  them  in  the  necessitous  areas.   The  Ministry  ofLabour  are  preoccupied with Unemployment, a  remedy  for which is from all  sides demanded.  The  Ministry of  Transport is  faced withan  immense  programme  of   Road  reconstruction  to  meet the  ever-growing  traffic  which our system  of  local taxation is encouraging onto the  roads, largely  at the  expense  of the railways.   The Ministryof  Agriculture  pleads  the  woes  of  the  farmers;  and   our  Con-servative  Agricultural Committee in the  House of Commons has just
demanded, apparently as an exceptional largesse, the complete relief  ofagricultural rates.  The Mines Department  is daily confronted with thedepression on  the coal  fields and  the  resulting  unemployment  anddistress.  From every side we hear  the cry of  the basic industries forsome relief from  rates and social services.  Month by month the Boardof Trade statistics point to the adverse trade balance and the difficulty  in maintaining our indispensable  quantum  of exports.    But all  efforts undertaken independently, however  well  conceived,will fall by the way.   They encounter all the resistances of petty interestsand all the eddies and cross-currents of  partial solutions, without havingthe indispensable  driving  power.   That driving  power  can  only   beprovided by money.  The money which can be  obtained and I believecomparatively easily  and painlessly obtained through the  Liquid FuelTax will afford not  only the  necessary impulse, but the medium whichunites and at the same time simplifies  all these problems in a commonsolution.  All can  be dealt with  together.  None can be handled apart.We have, therefore, to choose, and choose in  the  next six weeks, between a positive  constructive  policy in its integrity or just carrying  on andhoping  that  things will grow better as no  doubt they  often do of themselves.    24.   There is  no need, however,  to  exaggerate the  scale  of  theoperation.  There  is  nothing  to  prevent it  being achieved, or virtuallyachieved, in the present  Parliament.  There  is nothing in it which, if  itwere challenged (and  it certainly will  be), would prevent an earlier appealto the constituencies,  if we thought it opportune. The only levers at our disposal are financial.   40 millions obtained at a certain cost in national life-strength  are not  overwhelming.  But  we are not using money as a mere  expense, but as  a motive  and combining  power.  I  wish the leverswere  larger.   They are,  however, serious and potent, and I do not know from what  quarters their equals in power and practicability can be found.                                                           W.  S. C.    January 20, 192S.

               Local Pates in Relation to the Cost of Production.(1.) The Direct Burden of Rates.    On a  rough estimate  the direct burden of rates on  industry represents about one-half per cent, on the cost of production.   But the ratio varies widely from oneindustry to another, from  one firm to  another and  for the  same  firm  from year to year according to its output.   The figures given below have been supplied on various occasions by individual firms or associations.                 Table I.Variation  between Industries and  Firms.

The Cumulative Effect oj Rates.    The above tables show only the direct charge for rates in each industry. practically all industries, however, make use of the products of other industries, and the element of rates in the price of these products has to be added on to  their own direct charges togive the total effect  of rates  on the price of the finished article.   In connection withthe enquiry of the Committee on  Trade and Industry, the National Federation of Ironand  Steel Manufacturers submitted estimates of the direct and cumulative effects ofrates on the price of  certain basic products as below : 
              Table IV.Direct and Cumulative  Effects of  Rates.	Local Bates per Ton, 1923.		Direct Charge.	Cumulative Charge.Steel ship plates... Steel rails Tin plates...	s. d. 3 7  3 9 5 Oi	6.v. = 2-98 per cent, oi&apos; selling price. as. Orf. = 3-03 per cent, of selling price. 6s. 5rf. = 1-33 per cent, of selling price.    It  does not  appear, however,  from such  details  as are  available  of  these calculations that  any  allowance  was  made  for  the considerable element of ratesentering into  the cost  of public  utility services,  especially railway  and  dock  dues.In typical cases it has been calculated that railway charges alone  account  for:          29 per cent, of the price of pig iron, i.e., about -23s. 5d. a  ton.         16i per cent,  of the price  of steel plates, i.e., about 30*-. 2d.  a  ton.    If  the  rates at present  paid by railways be  regarded as  spread proportionatelyover all railway charges, they would  represent an addition to  the above  cumulativecharges of from 11(/. to Is. 2d., but if the rating relief to be granted to the  railways be devoted mainly to the reduction of the freights on certain  basic commodities, such ascoal for shipment and  industrial  use,  iron ore, limestone,  pig  iron and steel  billets,ingots,  &amp;c.. the aggregate relief afforded by the scheme to  the heavy  industries wouldbe  considerably greater.   A -20  per cent, reduction of such  freights which  wouldbe  roughly equivalent  in cost to the rating i-elief to  the railways would on theabove figures represent a reduction of 4s. 8d.  and 6s. a  ton respectively in  the railway charges  included  in the price  of pig  iron and  steel  plates.   This would  givea cumulative reduction  in the latter case, after allowing for the national rate, of about9s. or 10s.  a ton.  Coal for export or industrial use would benefit from  such  a reductionof railway rates by about 6(/. a ton in  addition to a  direct  gain from  relief of itsown rates of about the  same amount on the average, or Is. a ton  in  all.    Detailed calculations were not made  by the Committee on Trade  and industry for other products,  but they pointed out that in  the  case of  textiles  an allowance for rates falls to be added to the cost of  production at each of the numerous  stages of spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, printing and other processes through  whichthe raw material  passes  before-e reaching  the wholesale merchant.  In the case ofcotton piece goods, the rates arising in the first  two stages alone were estimated torepresent 2 per cent, of the  selling price.  The Committee came  to the general con-clusion that whereas direct rates represented a  burden  on production  of  roughlyone-half per cent, on the average, the cumulative burden (apparently excluding  any allowance for  the considerable element of rates  in  transport charges arising in the intermediate stages of production) was approximately two-and-a-half times  this figure,i.e., IJ per cent, on the value at works of the finished product.[16933]
THE  EATING  REFORM  SCHEME  IN  RELATION  TO  LOCAL                          GOVERNMENT.    THE main features of the scheme in relation to local government are:     (a.)  The  complete exemption from  local  rates  of  productive  and  transport           enterprises except  in so far as  they  occupy  property  which  would  be           rateable in other occupation, eg., houses, offices, shops, &amp;c.    (b.)  The provision from central funds of revenue in  place of that so lo6t by local           authorities.    The first question arising on the scheme, is  of  course  the fundamental  issuewhether tho relief to be given should, so far as the rating system is concerned, amountto total exemption or take  the form of a partial  exemption on the lines of that which parliament has in  the past accorded to agricultural land (as  regards all  rates) andto railways and canals (as regards sanitary rates).   The case for relief of productiveand transport enterprise mainly rests upon  industrial and economic  considerations;lu IS as a fcuci aim a oiuiiuiiia lu uiuuotiij nidi  luc owutriuc 1&amp;  jJUl 1U1HUIU.  DUl  lliflocal government implications are important and by no means uniformly against totalexemption.  It is proposed in this memorandum first to examine the arguments  forand against total exemption from  this point of view, next to discuss the  principles to be  followed in the distribution of the new revenue to  take the place of the present rates  on industrial property, and finally  to  explore some of the  practical  difficultieswhich arise in the application  of  these  principles  to the  present local  governmentsystem in this country.  The ultimate decision on the scheme as a whole must obviouslydepend upon  the balance of  advantage  and disadvantage over  the  three fields ofindustrial enterprise, national finance and local government.               I. Arguments  For and  Against Total Exemption.                          (A.) Considerations  of  Equity.    The rating system is  based  upon the local government community of  a  centuryor more ago when rich and poor,  employers and  employed lived in the same ratingarea and were able to distribute  among themselves, according  to their ability to pay,the expenses  of providing the limited social services  of that period.   As  applied tothe greatly extended  local government  services and the very different local governmentcommunities of the present clay this  system is extremely  faulty, whether looked at from the point  of  view  of ability  to  pay or from that  of benefit received.  And inregard to  no class of ratepayers  are the inequalities  so glaring as in regard to  the occupiers of industrial property.
 Rules on Industrial Property as a Measure oj Ability to Pay.     Whatever may have  been tho  intention of  the Act  of  Elizabeth,  few people could venture to  justify  the present rates  on industrial  property  as a  measure  of ability to pay.  The returns obtained by  the Inland  Revenue  Department show  that even taking average figures  for different types  of  enterprise  the  ratio  of  rates  to profits ranges from 3 to 21 per cent., while for industrial concerns in  the  same group the  range is from less  than 2 jxjr  cent, to infinity (for  firms making no profits).   If the system is to be justified at all it must  clearly be on the alternative basis of benefit received. Hates on  Industrial Property as a  Measure of Benefit Received.     1. Direct Benefit. The total amount  raised by rates in  England  and Wales in the latest year (1921-25) for which detailed figures are available was  153 millions,of which   12 millions was required to  meet  general  administrative expenses  andother outgoings not allocated to sjiecified services, after crediting trading profits.   Thebalance of  111 millions can lie divided into two categories :      (a.)  Services  to individual citizens which are not directly  beneficial  to industry.           Those comprise education, libraries,  poor  relief, collection of house refuse,           treatment of bodily and  mental disease, maternity and child welfare, baths.           parks,  housing, cemeteries. &amp;c.     (h.)  Services  which confer some direct  benefit  upon industry as well as upon           individual inhabitants, viz. :  highways, street lighting, police and  justice.           sewers  and  sewage  disposal,  port  sanitation,   water supply  and  land           drainage.     The former group  accounts for about 61-4 per cent, of the   141 millions:  the38&apos;6 per cent, represented  by the latter group is  made up as follows :                                                   Per cent.Highways and streets (including lighting)     ...     24&quot;2Police  &apos;  . ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      64Sewers and sewage disposal ...       ...       ...      5&apos;4Fire brigade       ...       ...       ...       . .      1&apos;other services     ...       ...       ...       ...      13                                                                 3S-6     It will be seen  from  these figures that of the  local government  activities inrespect of which rates are levied on industrial property,  the  only services apart fromhighways which can be considered  at all directly beneficial represent but one-seventhof the total.   And oven for these services the benefit is usually  much smallerproportionately to the payment made  than that derived by the  ordinary ratepayer.The lai-ger undertakings  commonly provide for  their  own police and  fire protection and  their demands  upon  the sewerage system  are  usually small.  Where  services are rendered by  a public fire brigade an  ad hoc charge is not infrequently  madeaccording to  the  men and appliances  engaged.  This method  of direct  assessmentaccording to the service  rendered is almost invariably followed  for water supplied to industrial concerns and(  under a  system of exemption  of industrial  property  from rates, it might perhaps he extended to cover any large demands for disposal of sewage
 from such property.  This would be of the nature of a minor refinement; the broad fact  remains that except  for the  highway service,  industrial  property  derives  no benefit from local services  at all commensurate with its contribution.  As a criterion of the benefit derived from the highway service, local  rates are far  inferior to a tax on motor fuel, though the latter woidd be improved for this purpose by supplementing it with a tax on heavy horse-drawn vehicles.     &apos;2. Indirect Benefit. It will  probably he urged, however, that,  in so far as the case  for rating industry rests on benefit received, it rests not so much on these direct benefits  as  on  the indirect  benefit  it  derives  from  the  existence  of  organized communities  able  to supply  it  with  adequate and  efficient labour.   But  for the expenditure of the local authority in providing the social  services of such communities, employers would be  forced themselves to provide many of these services in order to maintain the efficiency of  their employees.   If this line of argument is valid, the charge upon  industry should fie  in  proportion to  the  labour employed,  but  the information collected by the Committee on Trade and Industry shows  wide divergences between the two.   The Committee give tables of the rates paid by typical  firms and their contributions  to national insurance  (which arc,  of course, a fairly  accurate measure of the  labour employed).  Even between  seven firms in the same group (of engineering) the ratio of  one to the other  ranges from 64 per cent,  to 500 per cent. As between different industries, the range is from 5(5  per cent, to 800  per cent.     This wide  variation  arises partly  from  the fact that some firms employ  much more labour than others  in  proportion to  the annual value of  the  property occupied. but the variations arising in this  way  are  seriously aggravated by  the  wide  range in the poundage of the rates  (from about. 7s. (if/,  to over  8&apos;2s.).  This  range  is largely the result of a radical change in the character of the local government communities. Owing to the growth of the company system of ownership on the one  hand, and the great development of transport facilities on the other, the  old self-contained economic unit of a century ago has largely disappeared.  The  population which is economically interested in any centre of activity is tending to spread each year over a wider radius. and  in so doing a process of segregation inevitably takes place, the  rich seeking the more desirable  ,parts of  the country  well  removed  from industrial  activity the Bichmonds, the fSournemouths, the Amblesides the poor having to  be content with less   desirable   surroundings giving  cheap  and  easy  access  to  their  work the Walthamstows,  the Chester-le-Streets.  the  Stoke-on-Trents.  Where,  as  generally happens,  the  homes of the  majority of the workers are in the same rating  area  as their  industries, the inevitable tendency is for  rates to rise, making  this  area still less attractive to the wealthier inhabitants.  This process operates in  a vicious circle, with  the result  that there  is a general tendency  for the rates in the more highlyindustrialised  areas  to be abnormally high,  piwiding a constant economic  pressure on industries to move to  areas where the rates are at present very low.  Thus, one has similar firms paying rates of very differing amounts for the same indirect benefitof an efficient supply of labour.  Whether, under  any  scheme of reform,  a flat-ratecharge on industry directly  proportional  to the  labour  employed should be  retainedis more a matter of expediency than of abstract justice.  For there can be no doubtthat,  were such  a charge  imposed, it would tend to be passed on to the consumer.
                          (13.) Practical Consideration!;.    Proposals  to  restrict the  relief of industry  to half its  present  rateable  valuehave probably  been suggested  more by practical  considerations of  the  effect  of  totalexemption  on the local government system than  by considerations of equity.   the fear has been expressed that the change would make it difficult for local  governmentcommunities to finance their expenditure:  that it  would have prejudicial  effects onthe standard of local  administration:  that it  would add  a new  complexity to  the rating  system and  would  lead  to irresistible claims from other classes  of ratepayers.(i.) Local Government Finance.    Before  embarking on  a  radical   change  of  local  government  finance  of  thecharacter contemplated, it must of course be sliown that it will enable local  govern-ment services to be financed at least  as satisfactorily as under the present  system.Experience of the  last  few years has shown steadily growing difficulty on the part ofcertain  local authorities  to  provide for their expenditure without  imposing rates  so high as  to threaten the  continued existence of the  main sources of wealth of theircommunity  and to depress  the already low standard  of housing  accommodation  oftheir working classes.  These  results necessarily  follow from the process of segrega-tion of  population  already noted above,  and there seems  to be every prospect  thatthey will become more serious as  time goes on.  unless  some  far-reaching  reform isundertaken.  How  far the present scheme  provides  a solution  of these difficulties isexamined in the latter  part of this memorandum.(ii.) The Efficiency of Local Administration.    It  has been stated that it  is difficult now to induce leading business  men in  thelocal areas to serve on the local authorities, and the  view has been  expressed  that under a scheme of total  exemption local interest  in  local rates would  be lessened inthe proportion  of  one-fifth to  one-fourth over the country as  a whole and in much larger  proportion in many areas.   According  to this view,  the result would be  to diminish very seriously the financial incentive to business men  in such  areas to  serve on their local authorities,  to  the grave  detriment of local government.   This probablyconstitutes the strongest  of  the arguments which  have been  brought against totalexemption.    Under the  scheme of total exemption  the rates  will be  paid in the main byhouseholders,  shopkeepers  and occupiers of  offices,  hotels,  theatres,  &amp;c.   the manufacturers, railway companies, &amp;c., who have  hitherto paid  large  rates,  will,in future, only pay rates on their offices, hotels, &amp;c.  In  place of  this revenue,  thelocal authority will receive  from  the  Central  Government a  new form  of revenuerelated  to  its needs but  independent  of expenditure.   The result  will be  that  if a community is extravagant, the rise in the rates will be rather sharper than under thepresent system, and, conversely, the electors will enjoy to  a greater extent  the fruitsof good  management.    It   is difficult  to believe that  in the average  type  of  case this system will  notconduce to greater rather than to  less efficiency  in  local administration.  It is  truethat there  will  no longer  be  the motive of self-interest to drive the big employers oflabour  to endeavour to influence the decisions  of the Town Council in their  favour.Many  industrial undertakings  at  the  present time  are  in the hands  of companies
who have  no voice in local affairs:  where  leading  private  employers  do take  a prominent  part, it  is quite as much  from a sense of citizenship and a desire to seethe affairs  of the City well  managed and  proper conditions of life provided  for itsinhabitants, as from the  lower  motive of self-interest.  In any case, the  motive ofself-interest works  very spasmodically.  It  is naturally stronger in the poorer townswhich  have the  higher poundage  of rates, reaching  its  greatest intensity in  thosepartial communities where there  is  a  large proportion of industrial  property and  alarge working-class electorate,  but  it is precisely  in those areas that  it  is  mostimpotent.  It is  a  feature of local elections of the last few years that the industrial areas of the country are coining more and more under the domination  of labour,  and,indeed, it  would appear  that the  time is  not  far distant when labour will  be  in  amajority on  the  councils of  most  of the industrial  towns.   Before that  day arrivesit is a matter  of vital importance to secure that any taxation of industry for  localpurposes is  taken  out  of   the  hands  of  local  bodies.   Recent  experience showsconclusively  that  the  working-class electorate  and  its  representatives  cannot  botrusted to  perceive where their  real  interests lie  in this matter.   No influence whichthe owners of  industrial  property can exert will be effective  against  &quot; Poplarism.&quot;Threats of the owners of industries  to transfer their  works  elsewhere are not  takenseriously until the situation has  become desperate, and  then  their actual departureintensifies  the local difficulties.   Some more direct, immediate and  less suicidalremedy is  required.   The essentials of a  satisfactory solution would appear to be,first, that  the services should be placed in  the hands of the  authorities most suitable to administer them; and, secondly, that revenue, subsidiary  to  the  rates levied onhouses, shops  and offices, should  be available, in sufficient  measure to enable  these services  to be  provided up to a reasonable standard.   After that, one must trust  tothe  automatic  effect of extravagant  or economical management on the occupiers  of properties  still rateable.     From the point of view of  local efficiency, it is probably even more important  tosecure extensions of the areas of administration than the  maintenance of the businesselement on local councils.   I3xperience in  connection  with Parliament would seem  toshow that  true economy  can only be achieved  by an administrative machine like theTreasury,  well removed and carefully protected from electoral  influences.   The  widerthe area of management  and the more intricate the task  of the Council, the more itsaffairs tend inevitably to come  into  the hands  of men who give their  whole time andenergy to  the  task.  From this point of view,  the present scheme would be definitelyadvantageous, for it will be seen below that an  extension of the areas of administration in regard  to certain services is  essential, if it is to work properly.     Even as regards the ordinary extension  of  town boundaries, the scheme should operate  advantageously.   Under  present  arrangements,  such  extensions  are  often complicated by  the existence of large blocks of  industrial property, and  also by the poverty of certain  suburbs.  Were industrial property  taken entirely out of the field of rating and were the revenue given in its place related to a basis of need,  there  would be no question arising on the industrial properties, while, in accepting areas of lower rateable value,  the town would  have the assurance  that the  teeming population of these areas would attract a materially increased grant from the Central  Fund.
               II. Principles of Distribution of the  New Grant.    Although the old self-contained economic community for which the rating system was devised has largely  disappeared, one may nevertheless  deduce from it  the main principles which should be followed in any distribution of new revenue given in lieu of rates on industrial property.  In the old community, the cost of providing the localgovernment services of the day was spread rateably among all classes of the community.Thus  the workers  obtained assistance  from  then&apos; employers towards meeting theirsocial needs which they could hardly have met themselves without help.    It is important to notice first that in the main such social services were, and still are, required not at the place of employment of the  workers  but at their  homes.Generally speaking, it  is not the opening of a new factory, a new coal-mine  or a newrailway line that causes local expenditure.   Even  where undertakings are started inwholly rural surroundings they usually  provide themselves with such services as they need, excepting the general use of the public highways.  The need for new streets,sewers, water supply,  housing,  schools,  police, health services, poor relief, all flowsfrom  the incursion  of  population, especially working-class  population,  that  followsthe new  industrial  development.(iii.i Complexity  of Administration^    In proposing to introduce a basis of exemption which makes it necessary in manycases to divide properties for the purpose  of valuation which  are now treated as singleunits, thi! present scheme undoubtedly introduces a new element of complication.   Onthe other hand,  the entire exclusion  of productive  and transport enterprise  from local rating,  except for certain easily valued  properties, would mean a simplificationof the system out of all proportion  to this additional complication.   Local authorities,rating surveyors  and the Courts have  exercised their ingenuity again and again  toapply the old criterion  of the amount which  a  tenant, on a yearly basis, would pay for  the  property,  to  such  unlettahle properties as shipyards, iron  foundries, docks and railways.  The crowning absurdity of the system is perhaps reached in the caseof I lie railway,  where the valuation authority is called  upon  to place an annual valueon a piece of line passing through  its area which  may  have  no stations upon it.Commissions and Committees have again and again  commented on  the complicationand the resulting uncertainty and  high  cost of administering this system.(iv.) The Reactions of  Complete Exemption of Industrial  Property on  Other  Classes      of Ratepayers.    It  has  boon claimed  as an argument  in  favour of  making the  exemption  ofindustrial property only partial that complete relief would lead  to claims from other classes of ratepayers for similar treatment which it would  be difficult to resist.  Thisis open to question. .The continued appearance of industrial  property in the ratebookson a 50 per cent, basis would remind other occupiers of its privileged position.  Undercomplete exemption,  it  would pass entirely  from the  valuation  list,  and  it would come in time to be regarded in much  the  same way as stock  in trade is now regarded.The sheer impossibility of extending total exemption  to such  property as shops and offices without wrecking the local taxation system would alone be a  sufficient safeguard against  any such action.
    Secondly, it will be observed that in the old community the assistance receivedby (ho poorer classes from (heir employers towards  meeting their social needs was in proportion to the amount of service required  and was greater the less their ability tocontribute themselves.  If, therefore,  any approximation to the old state of affairs isto be  reached in  the allocation of new revenue     I. It must be distributed in the main with reference to population;    2. This factor should be modified  to allow for                The comparative  need for  local  services so  far as this  can be done                 without excessive complication  or the introduction  of expenditure                 as a factor:  and           (b.) The comparative wealth and poverty of (be inhabitants.Thus, instead of the present system by which some employees get the benefit of muchindustrial property, some of little, each worker will  carry to his home, so to speak, asmall  carefully adjusted  element  of similar revenue to  hell) him in the provision ofIns social  services.   Whatever  adjustments may  be  made  in  local   governmentboundaries and  in  units of  administration, it is clear that only by a distribution ofrevenue on a national basis can such a result  be obtained.    It will be recognised that the principles on which it  is suggested that the  newgrant  should be distributed follow  very closely those  adopted as the  basis of  thegeneral block grant scheme  of last year, and of the  more  restricted scheme whichthe Minister of  Health proposes should be introduced along with any reform  of  the poor  Law.  Indeed, one should look  forward ultimately  to all the assistance givento local authorities from national revenues being merged  in one consolidated  grant.In its aggregate  amount this would not  be far short of the amount  being raised  byrates  on houses, offices,  shops, &amp;c.    The formula agreed upon in  regard  to the  general  block  grant  scheme  was drawn up, however,  with special reference to the  semi-national  services in respectof which it was to  be  given.   These did not include the Poor  Law, except in so faras it  covered health services,  nor did the  scheme  cover more  than  a small  part ofthe roads. ;For  the purposes  of  the  present distribution  it is necessary to  look at local  needs from the point  of  view of all local government  sendees  and not merelythose  hitherto the subject of specific grants.   It will then  be seen  that this formula,while providing very satisfactorily for variations in  the  character of the population,in its wealth or poverty, and in the sparseness of its disti-distribution,  is defective as  an index of the local  need  for  road  services and for public assistance.   It so happensthat it  is precisely those  districts  which  stand to  lose most by  the  exemption  of productive and transport property that are  faced with the heaviest burdens in respectof these services, viz., the highly  industrialised areas and the purely  rural  areas,the loss  in the latter case arising not only from the exemption of agricultural land.but in many eases  even  more  from that  of railway  property.  It is essential in both cases  to secure  that local finances  are  adequate  to enable local authorities to cope with their responsibilities under the new conditions.High icays.    The  demands  made upon  local  finances for  the  maintenance of  the  publichighways outside the larger  towns are  only to a  small  extent determined  by  theamount  and character of  the population  in  the   immediate  vicinity.    The  more
important tiie road,  the wider the area from which it draws its traffic.   If  there forfeit  is desired  to  measure the needs  for road services by general factors  other  thanexpenditure,  the area to be taken  as the basis  of the calculation must bo  wide.  Forthis reason the Barstow Committee, in drawing up the scheme for a General  block grant, came  to the conclusion (hat the more important roads outside the towns  must be excluded,  and, as regards the  remainder,  that  it was  impracticable to deal withsmaller units than the counties and  county boroughs.  Variations  between countiesin the need for minor roads were  allowed for by introducing the factor of sparsenessnf population into the distribution.    The same difficulty arises under  the present  scheme.  For the time being thesystem  of grants  from the Road  Fund  should be. able to provide satisfactorily forvariations in  the cost of the classified roads between one  county and another  whichcannot be allowed for by the new  grant, hut as regards the roads now charged  uponthe district rates it  is essential that,  with  the entire exemption  of agricultural and railway property from local  rating, the charge should  be  transferred to the county.Poor Relief.    Somewhat similar considerations arise iii regard  to  the  cost  of Poor  Relief.The present areas, of charge  are small.   Where  the burden is heaviest,  it  willfrequently  be found that the loss of industrial property is well  above the average,but there is the  additional complication in this case  that the burden is  extremelyvariable, both in time and place.   It seems absolutely essential  that any grant ofthe character now proposed, or which  may be given under the  Ministry  of  Healthscheme,  should contain a factor varying with the state of employment in the area;such, for example, as the  proportion of  the  Ministry of Labour Live Register tothe total population.   It would only be necessary for this factor to operate whenunemployment rose above a normal figure.   Without such an  adjustment, not only would  areas at present  enjoying  good  employment be in  serious difficulties when their  day  of misfortune  came,  but  existing areas  suffering  from  heavy trade depression  would  either have their initial grants fixed below their needs, or, at a later date, be  found to be receiving far  too much.    But  even with a  factor of this character, areas of  distribution of the size of the poor Law  Union would  give rise  to serious difficulties.  On administrative groundsthe Minister of  Health  set out to make  the Poor Law  service a  County  chargethroughout, but he has  met with strong opposition from  the  rural  members of theHouse  of Commons, who see in it a danger both  of loss of local  powers and  also of increased rates due to spreading Urban  Unemployment charges over the County.    These  two difficulties,  that of  the  rural  roads and  that of  poor  relief, wouldappear to be complementary to each other.  If the administration of these services is  ever to  be placed upon a satisfactory footing, it is  essential  that administrative and financial considerations should prevail over parochialism.  It  is difficult to think of  any  opportunity likely to  arise in  the future  so  favourable  for  accomplishingthese reforms as  that afforded  by  the present scheme.   Both to the  farming interestand  to the industrialists it  is proposed to offer a  great  relief.   The  farmer  willescape  the  rates on his land, the industrialist the rates on his mine or factory, whileboth will see menacing local  burdens,  the one of road maintenance and  the other of  unemployment, spread over a  wider  area.  In one  case, the spreading is  to theadvantage  of the town, in the other to the advantage of  the country.  If,  as part     [16933]
of a schemo  of this magnitude,,it is impossible to buy these two reforms, then localgovernment reform  may well he regarded as an  impossible task.     Subject  to  these  two  desirable  reforms, it  should  be  possible  to  devise asatisfactory basis of distinction of the  new revenue  to he granted  in lieu of rales on industrial  property,  together  witli any  additional  grant  that may  be forthcomingcither under  (he block  grant  scheme  of the Ministry of Health  or  at a later  dateunder the  general grant proposals.  The money  would be distributed on the basis of population, modified with reference to assessable value per  head, the proportion ofchildren under  five,  the sparsencss  of population and  tho  degree  of  abnormalunemployment.  The grant so arrived at should be revised only at intervals,  probablyquinquennial, in accordance with the  results  of a  new census.   In  order  to  assurelocal  authorities  that, in course of time,  an undue  burden would not be thrown upon(lie property still left rateable, il is suggested that the proportion  which (he grantbears at tho  outset  to the  amount raised  in  rates  should  he maintained  on everyrevision.     In suggesting that  such a scheme  of  distribution  of nationally-raised  revenue,working in conjunction with the  continued  operation of the  rating system  in  regardto property  still  rateable,  would provide  for the  satisfactory  financing   of  local services, it is not intended to imply merely that it would be as good  as the presentsystem.  It is only  necessary to compare the expenditure per head of  population andthe  poundage  of rates in  various areas  to  realise the serious irregularities  andinjustices of  that system. Rather is it intended to imply that  the proposed  arrange-ments would  make it  possible for tho  first time  for  many  years  for  every localgovernment area to finance  its  social  needs  up to a  reasonable standard withoutoppressive  and  injurious taxation and for  all local authorities  to  look forward  tofurther movements  of the  population  on the  lines of those  now taking place  withsome degree of equanimity.                 III. The  Scheme of  Distiuhutiox in Practice.     Hitherto  the principles  of  distribution of  the new revenue in place of the rates on industrial property have  been considered without reference to  the  actual revenueat present  derived by local authorities from such property.  It can hardly bo expectedthat a distribution  worked  out on  these principles  would approximate at all closely to the present very irregular  distribution.  Returns obtained by the  Scottish  Boardof Health  in connection with the  Rating (Scotland) Act, 1926, show a range  in  theproportion  borne by the  rates  on industrial property to the  total amount  raised ineach  of the fourteen largest Scottish  burghs from  about 10  per cent, for Stirling to86 per cent, for Paisley; Edinburgh being about 17  per cent,  and Cilasgow 22  per cent.For  partial communities such  as the dormitories  of London  or  the  Welsh miningvalleys, there would be a still greater range of variation.     It  would, of  course,  be  necessary to guarantee all   authorities   against  animmediate  increase  of  rates  on  the  exemption of  industrial  property,  and   theoperation  of the distribution  formula would  at  the outset, therefore,  have  to belimited to  the new  money  that was being provided.  But  this initial distribution ofthe deficiency grant should  not bo regarded  as  storeotyped for all  time.  In  the eventof a  decline  in  the population  of any area  this  grant should  be  proportionatelyreduced on the next revision;  it  should  also be reduced with reference to a decreasein an abnormally high level of unemployment.  Increases in respect  of these  factors
should, however, be made on the formula grant, not on the deficiency grant.  Further,in order  to  guarantee,  and indeed hasten, the disappearance of the deficiency  grantas such,  it  has  been  suggested that  at  each quinquennial revision  a  uniform 10  percent,  should be deducted  from  all  deficiency  grants and  redistributed  upon  theformula basis.    It is proposed that the distribution of the formula grant should be  made to  twotypes of  authority and two only. viz.  :     (1.1  Hie county  and  county borough councils, which  it is contemplated should           in future be in charge of the administration of the semi-national services            education,  all  highways  other than  streets  of  no  through  traffic  value.           police, some health services and poor relief:    (2.)  The district  authorities.  i&apos;.c.  borough,  urban  and rural district councils,           carrying on the domestic  services of sanitation, maintenance of residential           streets, street cleaning and lighting, &amp;c.County borough councils would of course receive both grants.    A dual distribution of this kind would take no  account of the  special positionof the minor authorities for education and police, which,  though primarily responsiblefor domestic  services,  yet  provide  one or  both of  those semi-national services.They would of course receive  the grant  in respect of  domestic  services,  but it  wouldbo  impossible  without  excessive  complication  of  the   scheme  to provide  specialadjustments in  respect of these additional  services.   If. therefore, these  authoritieswish  to  retain  their  special powers,  they must  either be  content  to  share rateablythrough  the general  county rate in  any new formula grant to the county councils.or they  must make  special arrangements with  their respective county councils forfurther assistance. Failing such arrangements, the scheme would so operate in  many instances as to exert a steady  financial  pressure  on these authorities to  give up their powers,  and it  is to be hoped that in this way the strongly entrenched position  whichthese  authorities  at   present   occupy   would  be  secured  piecemeal  without  theadministrative  disturbance and  political  risk involved in a frontal  attack.   With thefinal  elimination  of  these  minor authorities following upon  the transfer  of  allhighway and poor law services to the county and county borough councils,  the systemof  administrative  areas  could at  last  be said  to be on  a reasonably satisfactoryfooting  and  attention  could  then  be devoted  to  improving  the  organisation,  andparticularly the financial  control, of the  major authorities  to  enable them to copesatisfactorily with the  enlarged responsibilities  that it would then  be possible to entrust to them.
