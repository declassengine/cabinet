   1 circulate for  consideration by the Cabinet a  note  prepared in  my Department,on  the  question  of the  admission of Afghanistan  to the League  of  Nations,  incontinuation of the paper (CP. 34 (2S)) previously circulated in regard to our political relations with Afghanistan.       INDIA OFFICE,                                           BIRKENHEAD.    16th February 192S.Question of the Admission of Afghanistan  to the League of Nations.    There seems some possibility that  the question of Afghanistan&apos;s admission to theLeague may be  touched  on in the  course  of  the political discussions  which  areexpected  to  he held during the  King&apos;s  visit.   It would not  be unnatural for theKing to wish lo obtain, as  a result of his visits to European capitals, a formal andgeneral recognition of the international  status of Afghanistan such as admission tothe League would afford.   Again,  apart from the contingent guarantees of  security against aggression offered to  signatories  of the Covenant, Afghanistan  might seeadvantage in obtaining the right to ventilate at Geneva grievances against  GreatBritain over  disputes in which she is unable to secure full satisfaction through the diplomatic channels, particularly  those  relating to transit  and frontier  questions.Persia&apos;s declaration, following  on  the visit of a  League Commission of Enquiry intoopium production, protesting against the  inequality of her  Commercial Treaty withGreat Britain aud her recent note to the  League regarding Bahrein will not  have remained unnoticed by the Afghan Government.   Moreover,  they may think  that theexecution by Persia of the articles relating  to neutrality  in the recently  concludedPerso-Afghau Treaty is rendered  so  problematical  by her insistence on a declarationmaintaining  her obligations  under  the  Covenant  as to make it  worth while forAfghanistan  to  secure similar freedom of action.  Hopes may alsoAie entertained  bythe Afghan  Government  of securing cheaply through League  agency financial andtechnical assistance in the  development of the country on modern lines.    On the other side, it has to be borne in mind  that there has  not  in the past been any indication  of Afghan  enthusiasm for the. League, and that, in fact, membershipmight not be of immediate advantage  to Afghanistan hi the present orientation of herpolicy.   In 1921, Sirdar Mahmud Tarzi referred to the question of Afghanistan joining the League in discussions  with Sir Henry Dobbs and  asked for  our good offices.  Itwas ascertained  that  Afghanistan should  be advised  to  address  a letter to theSecretary-General of the League making formal  application for admission at the nextAssembly, but  nothing more was heard of this suggestion.  After ratification of thoAnglo-Afghan Treaty in February 1922, the  text and  the accompanying notes were sent to the Secretariat of the League for registration, in accordance with article IS ofthe Covenant, after the concurrence  of the Afghan Government  had been  obtained.not without some difficulty in view of  the  restrictions imposed on Russian Consulatesin south-east Afghanistan.   Mr.  Maconaehie, Charge d&apos;Affaires at  Kabul, replyingin  a  despatch  of  ISth  Aligust  1924 .to  a circular despatch from the ForeignOffice in  which  it was asked what  attitude was adopted by foreign Governments andby public opinion towards the League and  how League questions  were dealt with,reported  that the Afghan Government had  not as yet  evinced any particular  interestin the League or shown a desire to join it.   No League question  appeared  to  requireto be dealt  with in the country  and there was no  private body  enlisting public support for the  League,  lie mentioned a recent statement in an Indian newspaperwhich  circulated in  Afghanistan  that &quot; the  League of Nations  does  not  enjoy thecoulideuce of Oriental  or  smaller  nations, dominated as it  is by the Allies ami theirrepresentatives.&quot;   He expressed the fear  that in a country like Afghanistan, whereEuropean statesmen were usually credited  with more  astuteness  than honesty  of purpose,  such  views  were  likely  to  find  general  acceptance  among  the educatedclasses.75 2.2S   [This Document is  the  Property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                    Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1928.SECRET.CP. 48(28).
   Since 192-f there lias been  no direct reference in despatches from  Kabul to theAfghan attitude towards the League.   But Sir  Francis  llumphrys, judging  from private conversations with the King and the Foreign Minister, thinks it unlikely thatAfghanistan will apply for admission to the League while the United States of Americaremains  outside.   Moreover, it is  probable  that  the  relations  existing  betweenAfghanistan  and  two important  non-member  States, Russia  and  Turkey,  would strongly  militate, against such a step.   The obligations undertaken in the AfghanTreaty with Turkey in 1021  and in  Neutrality  Fact with  Russia  in 1020 are of an anti-League character.   Relying on  Turkish assistance in  tho reorganisation of theAfghan Army ami  on  Russia for a subsidy and  other material assistance, the AfghanGovernment would hesitate to risk offending either party.   If Turkey were to enter the League the position would be different; but Turkey has been stated  to make heradmission to the Council a condition of  membership, and the Afghan people, whosevanity is at least as great as that of  the  Turks, might easily take  the same line.  it therefore seems  improbable that an expression  by the Afghans of a  wish to join theLeague, if made in the  forthcoming  conversations, would  be sincere.  On  the otherhand, they may think it  worth while to make tentative enquiries on  the subject,  witha view to eliciting  from us what compensation would be offered to them for  adopting the policy of the League.   On the technical side it does not appear that there need be any great difficulty in securing Afghanistan&apos;s admission to the League.   Under  article  1  of  the Covenant&quot; any fully self-governing State  .  .  .  may become a Member of the League if itsadmission is agreed to  by two-thirds of the Assembly, provided that  it shall  giveeffective  guarantees of its  sincere intention  to  observe  its international obligations and shall accept such regulations as may be prescribed by the League in regard to its military, Naval and Air Forces and Armaments.&quot;  When the admission  of  Germanyto the  League was under consideration, the Sub-Committee appointed by the Leagueto examine her qualifications  dealt with them under the following questionnaire:     (1) Is the application of  the German Government for admission  to the League of         Nations in order ?    (2) Is  the German  Government recognised  dc  jure or  de facto, and  by  what         States ?    (3) Does the country possess a stable Government and well-defined frontiers?    (4) Is it self-governing ?    (5) What  have been  the acts  and Declarations of  the German  Government         regarding            (a) its  international engagements, and           (b) the stipulations of the League with regard to armaments?(and  on all  these questions &quot;satisfactory replies were secured).   In  the case of afghanistan  (o) and (5) (a) might conceivably  present  some  difficulty, but  havingregard to the ease wherewith States applying for membership have hitherto  been admitted, e.g. Republics of Central America, in  which U.S.A. Forces are permanentlyquartered,  and  Abyssinia, whose attitude in regard  to slavery was at least undersuspicion at the time, it does not appear that there woidd  be much hesitation inadmitting Afghanistan  (in spite of the  terms of her  treaty  with Russia and thePiparno incident) provided that her application  were supported by the League Statesrepresented at Kabul.    On general grounds His Majesty&apos;s Government could not but welcome the eventualaccession of Afghanistan to the League, provided that this act could  be interpreted asproof of her desire to be counted in future among the civilised  nations whose foreignpolicy is conducted in the interests of international peace, and which can he trustedto fulfil  the obligations as well as  enjoy the  advantages  of membership.  indian opinion might also be  expected to  be  favourable on the ground  that the regular meetings at Geneva of representatives of India and  Afghanistan on  an equal footing-might contribute to the growth of more friendly relations between  the two countries,and that their  respective points of  view  on  questions  affecting  Asiatic  countriesdiscussed at  the League might frequently be  found  to coincide.   It woidd also be reasonable to hope that the Afghan delegates, by mixing among the representatives of so many countries, might learn  more modesty and gain a juster appreciation of therelative importance of their country in the councils of  tho world.  But the mere factthat we have hitherto refrained from pressing Afghanistan to join the League indicates that these more obvious  advantages to be derived  from her accession do not exhaust
all  aspects of the  question.  It is  thought that the following other considerationsrequire to he examined :     (a) In Afghanistan itself  it seems unlikely  thai membership of the League wouldbe entirely welcome to the conservative and ecclesiastical elements of  the population.The constitution of Afghanistan, which has  recently  been brought to our  notice,contains expressions of respect for the status of the subject, forbids slavery, providesspecifically for indigenous education and promises justice for rich and poor alike andreligious toleration for Jews  and Hindus.   But since its promulgation an Alnnadimissionary from India has been stoned to death in Afghanistan, and the Islamicprinciple of Qizas, entitling the  family of a person who has met death at the  hands of another  to take personal vengeance on  the latter,  has been  applied against twoforeigners who were not  Moslems.   It is dillicult to believe that the upholders of  theIslamic law in the country would readily exchange the  personal prestige its exercisegives them for such enhancement of national prestige as Persia may  be held to havederived from apparent conformity with  the principles of the Covenant.  Thus fromthe internal point of view Afghanistan^? accession to the League might be unpopular.Implications, moreover, might be drawn from  it by  the nationals of States withoutau  Asiatic connection which, if they chose to reside in Afghanistan,  would  be liableto be falsified.   It  has been  no  part of our policy hitherto to encourage Europeansto settle in Afghanistan, and though the prestige of His Majesty&apos;s  Representative, hasbeen  such as to assist the  settlement of disputes between  Afghanistan and other powers regarding  the treatment of their subjects, it. would  be most  undesirable forIndia to be  called upon as  a  neighbour  State Member of  the  League to exercisepressure on  Afghanistan to ensure  the execution of an award under article 13 of the.Covenant.  The Government, of  India expressed a somewhat similar apprehension in atelegram of 23rd September 1924 received during the  discussion at  Geneva  of  the protocol lor  pacific settlement of international disputes: their  special anxiety beingthe risk of India being charged, as  a result of  having signed the optional  clause ofthe Statute of the International  Court, with the obligation of  taking measures against an  Asiatic country which refused to accept an  arbitral award.  In a further telegramof ISth February 1925 commenting on the  Protocol as a whole, the following passageoccurs:     &quot; Proposals regarding arbitration, determination of aggressor and armistice mayconceivably be  workable and effective as between highly organised  nations.  India,however, has  dealings with nations loosely organised and incapable  of appreciatingor working the complicated machinery lor dealing with or preventing hostilities.  Itwould clearly handicap India gravely to have to abide strictly by rigorous oldigationsunder the Protocol  which her less civilised antagonist woidd nor,  and perhaps couldnot, fulfil.  On  the crucial  portion  of our frontier  we have a tribal  belt nominallyours  but  responsive, especially  during periods of tension, to Afghan  intrigue, whichwould make any such arrangements  as are contemplated by the Protocol impossibleof  application  to  our  relations with Afghanistan.   Afghan  interpretation of  an armistice in  1919  when Afghanistan held back its army, yet  incited  our  tribes(potentially more formidable than any Afghan  army), throws  India&apos;s peculiar positioninto clear relief.   Insidious hostility in this  form would hardly be susceptible of proofto the satisfaction of a distant Council unversed in our frontier  problems.   Even if itwere, what control could a body of  men in Geneva exert on  forces in actual contactsomewhere in  the neighbourhood of our borders?  In such a conflict with Afghanistandisregarding the League&apos;s orders,   there would be  no one  to enforce them  exceptIndia.&quot;    The  criticisms  of  the Government of  India were especially directed  to  themanner in  which the Protocol sharpens the obligations of the Covenant in regard to measures for the prevention of war.   1 Jut they apply to a large extent  to the situationin which India would find herself vis-d-vis Afghanistan under the terms  of the Covenantitself  after her accession to the League.  Situated as India  is, with neighbourswho,  if they join the League, are to  a large  extent unable, even if they are willing, tocarry  out adequately  the resulting  obligations, it is inevitable,  as  matters  are  atpresent, that India  should feel that  further  additions to the ranks of the League from among her neighbours are apt  only to increase her  responsibilities without bringingcompensating advantages.  It would appear to bo contrary  to Indian interests thatAfghanistan should enter the League until it is  more fully proved that her Governmentis strong enough and actually willing to execute her obligations under  the Covenant.
   (6) Afghanistan^  immediate external  relations an.&apos;, apart, from  India, with  persia and  Russia, with both of which countries she has entered  into  pacts of neutrality, in1927  and 1926  respectively, more  or  less on the model of  the Agreement  between turkey and Russia  binding the  respective States  to  neutrality in the event oraggression  by a third party upon either.  The incompatibility  or  the neutralityclauses of the Perso-Afghan Treaty with article 1(5 of  the Covenant is mitigated bya  Persian  declaration recognised  by  Afghanistan  that  Persia intends  to maintainunimpaired her obligations under  the Covenant.  In the  event of  hostilities betweenPersia  and Afghanistan, from  which This  majesty&apos;s  Government  could not  whollvdisinterest themselves, it  is to  be assumed  that Persia, i[  Afghanistan were the aggressor, would appeal  to  the  Council  of   the  League  and set  in  motion theprocedure under which  Afghanistan  would he invited to accept  the  obligations of  the Covenant for  the  purpose of determining  the dispute.  If Afghanistanbecame a member of the League  she would be able  to make a similar appeal in theevent of aggression  by Persia, but even  as a  non-member  State Afghanistan would presumably be  able,  in such a case,  to rely on the good oflices of liis Majesty&apos;sGovernment and on  pressure being brought on  Persia with a  view to the preventionof war between the  two countries.   It  does  not,  therefore, appear that India&apos;scommitments, so far as the relations between Persia and Afghanistan are concerned,would necessarily be  increased  by  the  latters accession  to the League.   By Russia,on the  other  hand,  Afghanistan^  application for membership of  the League  mightbe expected to be regarded as an unfriendly act and  the material benefits now derivedby Afghanistan from  that source might in  consequence  cease to  he supplied.   the chance  that Russia  might commit  an act of aggression  against Afghanistan  wouldprobably be increased.  Afghanistan, on  the  other  hand, would be in a  position  to invoke assistance from the League in virtue of articles  10, 11  and .17 of  the Covenant.Whatever precise obligations these articles may be held to  entail, it  would becomeobligatory for His Majesty *s Government to interest themselves in the dispute betweenthe two countries.  The movement of troops through Persia  against Russia would,however,  be justified under the  terms  of the  Covenant,  if intervention became necessary.   It is already recognised that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not remainindifferent in  auy case to serious aggression by Russia against Afghanistan.  On theother hand,  if Afghanistan were  not a  member  of the League at  the time, it  wouldbe solely for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide  what constituted an act of aggressiou,whereas, if she were  in a position to appeal to the League, it would be necessary  to accommodate the action of  His Majesty&apos;s Government  and the Government  of  Indiato the views of the  situation held by other  States represented at  Geneva, with someresultant loss of  initiative.  Since, however, India would be the one  State in a positionto render immediate effective assistance  to Afghanistan, His  Majesty&apos;s Government.would, in practice, still be  in a  position  to determine whether assistance was to begiven by force of arms or otherwise.   Thus, apart from Afghanistau&apos;s entry into theLeague increasing the risk of a  conflict with Russia; it does not seem  that it  woxddnecessarily add to India&apos;s present commitments in this respect.   Lord Lovat,  in a recent note in  another connection, has suggested that some of theDominions  might advocate our  endeavouring to secure  Afghanistan&apos;s admission  tothe  League in  order that, in the  event of  Russian aggression, she might claim thebenefit of article 10 of the Covenant.  It seems doubtful  whether  the  guaranteesafforded by tho Covenant would, in fact, give Afghanistan any expectation of effectiveassistance from auy other quarter  than the British  Government.   Even  if measuresof assistance  were forthcoming  from the  League,  they  would probably fall  to becarried out in  the first instance by the  Government of India.  On the other hand,it is important to bear in mind that, whereas so long as Afghanistan is not a memberof the League intervention to protect her against Russian aggression would fall to he undertaken on  the  sole responsibility  of .llis Majesty&apos;s Government or the British Empire, and would  be certain to  be misrepresented  in  many quarters as an  act  of wanton aggression on our part, this would no longer be the case if Afghanistan were a  member  of tho League.  Our action would have international  support behind  il. This advantage  may be considered to outweigh the  disadvantage, from a military point of view, of having to regulate the conditions of our intervention by the opinion.of the other Powers at Geneva.    (r) Turning to Afghanistan^ relations  with India itself, it has been  suggestedearlier in this  note  that  some embarrassment  might   be  expected   to  arise from.
Afghanistan&apos;s inclination  to  ventilate  her  minor differences wiili us at Geneva.   Tin&apos;Afghans will  be the  more  likely  to  do this  because of their general  attitude ofdissociation from, if not hostility to, the Government of India, or because they might think that the raising of complaints against India would afford opportunif ies of driving awedge  between the British and Indian  Governments, and incidentally of embarrassingtheir representatives at Geneva.   A fruitful source of iniuorilisput.es with Afghanistanis to be found in the behaviour of  the  unadministered frontier tribes  on the Indianside of the Durand line.   Some  of  the indirect, methods employed by officers of theGovernment of India in controlling the tribes in default  of  taking the whole borderinto direct administration  might be dillicult to explain  in the critical, but imperfectlyinformed atmosphere of Geneva,   liaids into Afghanistan  in  pursuit of troublesome&quot; JJadinash &quot;  who had misbehaved un Indian soil  and toleration of similar Afghanraids  in our territory in  preference  to complaints through the  diplomatic channelwould  be somewhat dilhcult  to focus in the terms of  the Covenant, aud Afghanistan,as a newcomer, might be  expected to liud an  ear for grievances, real or imaginary,which  would  be less attentive to similar complaints from ourselves.    Except, for the advantages to be derived from having international support for our action  if at any time we are compelled to intervene in Afghanistan against russian aggression, the above considerations  seem  to  be, ou the whole, in favour of the postponement of Ai&apos;ghanistan&apos;s admission into the League  until, on. the one  hand, her own administration has reached  a higher standard and  her methods  of diplomacygreater stability, and,  on the  other  hand,  we have  carried  further  the work  ofpacifying and civilising the inhabitants of our  own border.  There would,  therefore,seem no need for us to reverse our previous  policy at  the present juncture and go outof our  way to suggest  to  the King of Afghanistan the desirability of his applyingimmediately for membership oT the League.    It  remains to  be considered in what way any enquiries from  the  Afghan  sideshould be met.  Although there are  some grounds for anticipating such  enquiries,existing Afghan commitments with Russia  and Turkey  make  it highly improbable that Afghanistan intends to apply for admission to the League in  the immediate future.The forthcoming meeting  of  the  Council at Geneva  will,  however,   afford  auopportunity  for asking Signor Scialoja, M. Briand and  herr Stresemaun whetherthe subject has been  broached by King Amanulla in  the course of his visits to Rome,Paris and Berlin,  ft can  then  be hinted  that it is doubtful  whether the  League hasderived much advantage from the accession  of Abyssinia, and  whether it  is a goodplan to encourage the admission of such semi-civilised  Slates  until  the  authorityof their central government  over  the  country  as a whole has  become more frimly established.    It  may be  assumed   that  the  Afghans  will  not   in  any  easetry  to  secure admission unless they are sure of the  support of  some,  at  any rate,of the Great  Powers.  There  seems  no  reason why we  should  give  the  Afghansground to  suspect  that, His Majesty s Government in particular are unenthusiasticabout  their  admission.   This   might  in  fact  stimulate   their  wish   to  join,while  if it  came to  be   known  to  the  more  extreme  advocates  of extendedmembership  of the League  in  this  country that we were  dissuading Afghanistanfrom joining, the  consequences  might be embarrassing.  The best course for HisMajesty&apos;s  Government  to adopt,  if approached  on the subject would  seem to  he  toinform tho Afghans, as in 11)21, that,  the correct procedure for  the Government of aState desiring admission to the League is to address a  letter to the Secretary-Generalmaking formal application for membership.  If the  Afghans were to ask  definitelywhat, chance they stood of  securing from the League  material assistance, e.g. in theform of a  reconstruction loan, sufficient to compensate them for sacrificing the material assistance  which they  now receive under the  Russo-Afghan Treaty, 1921, it.  might bodesirable  to  say that  we  could  not  answer  this  question, which  was   one  for examination by experts, hut that hitherto it had  been  impossible for the League to do more than  promote the raising of loans for reconstruction fully secured on tho  realisablefinancial and economic assets of  the country concerned.   On the whole, however, it.seems  best that His  i\!ajest.y&apos;s  Government should  avoid  saying anything in the conversations with  the Afghans liable  to create the  impression  that  we  have  any positive  wish  to  discourage Afghanistan  from  applying for  membership of  theI idague.
