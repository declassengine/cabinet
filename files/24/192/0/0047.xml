I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1928.SECRET.Copy No.30CP. 47 (28).TO  BE  KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND  KEY.It  is requested  that special care may be  taken    to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.NAVAL PROGRAMME COMMITTEE.Report on Naval Oil Fuel Reserves.     1.  IN accordance  with (b) of our terms of reference,  we have examined thefollowing oil fuel reserve questions :      (1.)  The assumptions on which the Admiralty have based the oil fuel require-           ments of the Fleet for the first year of a war in the Far East.     (2.)  The rate of accumulation of the Naval oil fuel reserve in 1928 and future           years.     2.  Our attention has been directed to the  discussions  which have from  timeto time taken place at the Committee of Imperial Defence on,this subject,  and wehave also had before us the First Annual Report of the Oil Board (C.I.D. Paper,No. 755-B) dated the 31st December, 1926, and the proceedings at the 220th Meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence, when that Report was before the Committee.The case of the Admiralty has been fully presented to us in a written memorandum and by means of oral statements made  to us by the First Sea Lord and the FourthSea Lord.  The case of the Treasury has been laid before us by the Chancellor of theExchequer.     3.   At their meeting on the 11th February, 1924, the Committee of ImperialDefence  in effect re-affirmed the decision of the War  Cabinet in 1919 that  theminimum reserve of  oil  fuel which it is safe to  provide  should be twelve months&apos;consumption on a war basis, and also decided that the reserve should be considered as a whole, but that the distribution should be entirely within the jurisdiction ofthe Admiralty, and that the total oil reserve should be completed by 1937, the yearlyaccumulation to be worked out between  the Admiralty and the Treasury.    4.   In pursuance of these conclusions, the Admiralty have calculated that the oil fuel requirements of the Fleet for the first year of the war in the Far East wouldbe 7,150,250&quot; tons.  This calculation is based on the following assumptions :      (a.)  That the war would not take place before 1937, and that the oil fuel reserve           would then be complete.     (6.) That the war would be entirely free from European complications.     (c.) That the main fleet would take li months to get to the Far East, and would          consist of 12  Battleships, 4 Battle-Cruisers, 31 Cruisers, 81 Leaders and          Destroyers, 40 Submarines, and about  97 other vessels.     (d.) That Che fleet would be able to steam for 10 days  a month at 18 knots.These assumptions were  put before the Oil Fuel Board, but that Board did not feelcalled upon to criticise them.[17226]
     5.  The Admiralty accordingly maintain that a reserve of 7,150,250 tons should be  completed  by the  year  1937.   Of  this  total  about  3,800,000  tons  have already been collected,&apos; leaving 3,300,000 tons to be  provided in the next 10 years. The Admiralty urge that this provision should be effected by a programme of steady equal annual instalments of 330,000 tons.     6.  The oil fuel reserve is, of course, designed to provide the necessary working stocks, and to bridge over the  months immediately  following the outbreak of war&quot;during which the difficulties inherent in  adjusting a greatly increased war demand to limited supplies are being  overcome.   The Admiralty are satisfied  that  these difficulties of securing an  increased output of crude  oil, of refining that  oil, and of transporting the refined  fuel oil by land and sea, will ultimately be met, but represent that months  must elapse before supplies adequate to satisfy the war demands are forthcoming.     7.  With regard to the actual amount of the reserve, the Admiralty claim that the figures represent  the  results of  very careful checking and  scrutiny on  many occasions, and that the calculation has so far as possible been based on the detailed working out  of  the reasonable and probable movements  of every unit  of  the fleet engaged in the war.  Emphasis has been laid  on the fact that the modern warship is entirely dependent on oil fuel, not only for steaming at sea, but for every purpose for which power is required.  In this connection we have been informed that, of the total naval consumption of oil  fuel  of 750.000 tons a year  in  time of peace,  only about 150,000 tons is used by the fleet while steaming at sea.  It has also been pointed out to us that  the United States of  America,  in spite of the great reserve existing under her soil, is accumulating a  fuel oil reserve of 7 million tons and Japan one of 4 million tons.     8.  As regards the rate of accumulation, the Admiralty urge that, until the reserve has been ^completed, full mobility for the fleet  cannot be assured, and that the advantages  of a policy of equal annual increments  are that it does not cast an unfair  burden on subsequent  years  and  that  it is more economical,  as regular purchases are less liable to disturb the markets.     9.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer does not question the necessity,  in existing conditions, for  an adequate oil fuel  reserve.   His criticisms have been directed against the amount of the reserve and the rate of annual accumulation.  He has reminded us  that in  1919, directly  after  the conclusion of  the Great  War, the Admiralty estimated their oil fuel reserve requirements at 4-i million tons,  and has urged that the increase of this figure to the present estimated&quot; amount of 7^ millions is a direct consequence of the Admiralty insistence for purposes of calculation on the hypothesis of  a war in the Far East in  or about 1937 with Japan as the enemy.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer has recalled the excellent  relations between ourselves and Japan now existing and likely to continue, to which special reference was made in our Report to the Cabinet on Cruisers (CP. 305 (27)), and has expressed the view that the financial, social and political conditions in Japan all combine to exclude a conflict between Great Britain and Japan from the sphere of reasonable probability.     10.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer has also criticised the Admiralty assump- tion that, in the event of a  Far  Eastern War,  the British Fleet would be called  upon to operate in  Japanese home waters to the extent on the average of 10 days&apos; steaming at sea a month, with 20 days in harbour, and has  suggested that it should be possible to effect a very substantial  reduction in the estimated figure of our war requirements for oil fuel if due regard is had to the nature of the strategical and tactical  considera- tions which it is probable will determine the course of events in a Far-Eastern War.     11.  With regard to the question of war-time supplies, we are informed that the reserve of  oil fuel in stock at  the end of the.first year of the Great War was sub-stantially in excess of the reserve with which we started the War. Emphasis has also been laid on  the  rapid  development of the Persian oil fields and the  favourable possibilities of large supplies being forthcoming in future from Iraq,  Having regardto these considerations and to the serious financial position, the Chancellor of theExchequer has impressed upon us the great  importance of restiicting expenditure atthe present time on this  particular service within the narrowest practicable limits.
2.  Whitehall Gardens. S.W. 1,      February 20, 1928.With oil fuel at  2 ]Qs. a ton, the saving on 330,000 tons would he  825,000, andon 230,000 tons would be  550.000,  in addition in  each case to the cost of storagetanks.     12.  In  all the circumstances the Chancellor of the  Exchequer has suggestedthat no special addition should \yc made in 1928 to  the existing oil fuel  reserve, butthat the Admiralty should be at liberty to add to that reserve any savings they maybe able to effect out of their 15)28 peace provision of over 750.000 tons.     13.  In  reply to the Chancellor of  the  Exchequer the Admiralty  have  urgedthat the 1919 estimate was prepared at a time when only part of the Fleet was dependent on oil fuel, that the assumption of  10 days steaming a month is confirmed by the experience  of the Great War, which unlike  a Far  Eastern War, was  a war of low mobility and close range.   They also now assert that in an &quot; Atlantic War &quot;the oil  fuel  requirements of the  fleet would  be quite.as large as the requirements for a  Far  Eastern War: and they claim that, in any  event,  it  would be  quite impracticable to make any savings for  the reserve  out of the  peace-time  fuelprovision without great and serious loss of efficiency.   We have also been reminded that the Naval reserve is the only substantial reserve of oil fuel  existing in  GreatBritain, and emphasis has been laid  on the desirability of maintaining an adequatereserve  to meet the growing needs  of the mercantile marine and for other civil purposes in times of national emergency.     14.  The Cabinet will recall  that with their approval and with the concurrence of the Committee of Imperial Defence the  amount added to the  oil fuel reserve in each of the years 1926 and  1927 was reduced from 330.000 tons  to 100,000 tons.On general grounds we  see considerable  advantage in maintaining the principlethat some addition to the reserve should lie made each year.   In view of the presentserious financial position, and without calling in question the general policy already adopted, we think that, as in 1926 and 1927.  the amount to be placed to the reserve in 1928 should be 100.000 tons,  but that this  reduction  should be effected on theunderstanding (a)  that the Cabinet accept  full  responsibility for  this decision, and(b) that the arrangement for the  addition of 100.000 tons to the oil fuel reserve in1928 is without prejudice to the further consideration of the questions before theCommittee and. in particular, to the amounts to be added to the reserve in future years.                                                         y     15.  In  view  of  the fact  that in this matter the Admiralty have  throughoutbeen acting on the authority and  in accordance with definite conclusions reached bythe Committee of  Imperial  Defence, we suggest, if the Cabinet agree,  that  steps should be taken with a view to our being constituted as a Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, in order that our conclusions may  be submitted tothat Committee.                          SUMMARY OF  CONCLUSIOXS.    16.  Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised  as follows :     (a.) Without at this time reopening  the  question of the general policy already          adopted, the amount  to be placed to the oil fuel reserve in 1928 should          be  100,000 tons, on  the  understanding that  the Cabinet accept  full          responsibility for  this decision:  and  that the  arrangement  for the          addition of  100,000  tons to  the  oil fuel reserve in 1928  is  without          prejudice  to  the  further consideration of the  questions  before the          Committee, and in  particular  to the amounts, if any, to  be added to the          reserve in future years.    (&amp;.) That, if the Cabinet  agree, steps should be taken to constitute us a sub-          committee of the Committee of Imperial  Defence.                              Signed on behalf of the Committee,                                                 BIRKENHEAD. Chairman.
