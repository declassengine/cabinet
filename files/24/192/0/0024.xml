Exchange of telegrams with His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Peking :             (a.) Telegram to Sir M. Lampson of the 7th January, 1928.            (b.) Telegram from  Sir M. Lampson of the  20th January, 1928.                                                                     A. C.    Foreign Office, January 30, 1928.                                     I.    MEMORANDUM BY THE FAR EASTERN DEPARTMENT OF THE FOREIGN  OFFICE.    The Chancellor of the Exchecpier has proposed that the balance of the indemnityfund now deposited in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank at Shanghai, amountingto about  2 million, should be confiscated  by His Majesty&apos;s Government in order tocontribute  to the  cost of the Shanghai Defence Force, and  that  further payments of the indemnity at the rate of  400,000 a year should be similarly diverted so longas the defence force has to be retained in China.    There  is much to be said in favour of the convenience of meeting  in this waythe burden  which  would otherwise  fall on  the British taxpayer; and in spite of  the many promises  which we have made regarding the utilisation of these funds  forpurposes mutually beneficial to China and Great Britain, there is a certain justice,which we fully appreciate, in a proposal to make the Chinese pay for a share of  theexpense which we have incurred in consequence of recent events in China and of  theaggressively anti-British attitude assumed by some of the Chinese.    But there are political considerations affecting not merely the special  questionof the Indemnity  but the whole scope of our China policy, which convince us thatthe temporary advantage to be gained by confiscating this money will be outweighed by very serious disadvantages extending into the future.    In this country the China Indemnity is regarded as British money, which isours, and solely  ours,  to give or to  withhold as we please.  But in China the money is looked upon as  Chinese money, extorted as a crushing indemnity and restored toan ally in the Great War as a tardy act of justice.  This proposal to confiscate nearly one-quarter of the total amount will be regretted by our friends and quoted by our enemies as a convincing proof of British bad faith.  In December 192G we published a memorandum  that  was designed to  show  that Great Britain  was animated  bynothing but goodwill  towards China, and  by a desire as soon as possible to set ourmutual relations upon an equal basis.  This memorandum was followed up by thetreaty revision offer of the 27th January, 1927, and by the agreement for the rendition      4291   [17135]                                                  B
 of the concession administrations at Hankow and Kiukiang.  The Chinese at first assumed that our December memorandum was merely one of the empty promises of which they have so often complained.  During the course of the year this mistrust gradually abated, partly owing to the decline of Russian influence and partly because in the case of the Hankow, Kiukiang and Tien-tsin concessions, they saw that we were really prepared to implement some of our promises.  So extreme a Nationalist as Mr. Wong Ching-wai stated to the Colonial  Secretary at Hong Kong on  the 28th October last:-                                    J        5     6         &quot; When he  returned to China in April  last he found that the speech  of     Sir Austen Chamberlain in regard to the return of Hankow to China had created     a favourable  impression on practically  the  whole Kuo  Min-tang, with  the     exception  of a few extremists.  The Kuo Min-tang wanted at the lime to give     wide publicity to the speech, as well as to the good impression which it had     created; but unfortunately the Bolsheviks who were still in the party prevented     this being done.&quot;     It is clear that the Chinese Nationalists (and in a wider sense all Chinese are Nationalists) are beginning to believe that we mean what we say.  The confiscation of the Boxer funds would be a severe blow to  this growth of confidence.  A  small matter in itself perhaps, but an  excellent and  easily quotable  illustration that  the Chinese were right in their first instinct of mistrusting our fine promises.     Our decision to confiscate  the funds will particularly affect the intelligentsia class that is to say, the most articulate class in China.  Their aim has been to get a regular revenue for higher education in China  from sources independent of  the vicissitudes  of Chinese politics.   They  have succeeded  in  getting the  American, Japanese and   (in part)  Russian  indemnities for this purpose,  and  they had apparently got  the British also.  In  their  disappointment  they will undoubtedly represent this reversal of our policy as a personal injury to the whole Chinese people.     This intelligentsia class already possesses strong links with the United States, Japan and France.  The absence of any corresponding link with Great Britain has often been deplored in the past and was one of the. chief reasons for  initiating our indemnity policy in 1922.  It is likely to be still more deplored in the future,  when the indemnity fund which was the most obvious material for forging such a link  will either have disappeared or have been materially reduced.     The present moment is perhaps a particularly unfortunate one for exposing to question  our good faith and our desire for friendship.  We  have hitherto believed and repeatedly stated in public that Chinese excesses were very largely due to Soviet intrigue and propaganda, and  that we wished to hold out a hand of friendship to China generally if this extremist element could be eliminated.  Within the last month all the. Southern Governments that is, all the  ^Nationalists&quot; and Kuo Min-tang partisans have  taken  such drastic  measures against  the  Russians and native Communists as have been  taken  by no other  Government in the world.  Russian influence in  China, which at one  time seemed to threaten us  not only in  China but throughout Asia, has been defeated to a degree surpassing our wildest hopes, and there is bound to be a reaction in our favour.   On the. 14th December the Nationalist Commissioner of Foreign Affairs at Shanghai, who is also Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in the  Nanking  Government, speaking to  a mixed audience at the Sino- American University Club,  declared  that his Government  had  been  facing the question which way to proceed respecting foreign policy, whether along Soviet linesor Anglo-Saxon lines.  He said            &quot; China is fed up with Communist intrigue and is determined to rid herself     of Communist influence, which is threatening to wreck the revolution.  Since     Western-educated Chinese are. convinced that the Anglo-Saxon road is the best     for China, I hope they  will exert their influence in support of the Nationalist     Government in order to bring about a new orientation of Kuo Min-tang policy.&quot;     Is it fair and is  it wise; to meet an advance of this kind by withholding  fromthe Chinese  a gift which they, as a matter of fact, persistently regard as theirs of right,  and which touches them  in their most sensitive spot, viz.,  education?   Will it in any way soften the blow to tell them that they may receive some balance  fromthe funds at some future date when the defence force is withdrawn?  Is  it wise tocouple this act  of confiscation with the expenses involved by the maintenance of theforce which every Chinese and every friend of China must regard as an unfortunate,even though necessary, phenomenon?  Is it not likely that the speedy improvement
of atmosphere promised by the recent turn of events may lead to a speedy withdrawalof the force?  Will not any act, such as this act of confiscation, be likely to impair the improvement of  our  relations with the Chinese, to delay the departure of theforce, and therefore, to continue the expense which it involves?     We have for the moment disposed of the influence in China of our enemies theRussians.   There remains  the  influence of our friends the Japanese and the americans which in some respects is  no less hostile and no less dangerous.   Bothof these  Rowers are already  committed to a  policy of  remitting their indemnitylor educational  and  cultural purposes; they have set up boards of administration in China and they have actually started work.  They are ahead of us in this respect.If we drop out of the running the Japanese will not hesitate to make political capitalout of our decision.  Their ambition is to  supplant us in our economic position inChina, and especially in  the Yang-tsze Valley, and by antagonising the Chinese we will  he playing  straight  into their hands.   They will not  hesitate to profit by ourmistake and to show the Chinese that  they  are the friends who keep  promises andwe are the  friends who  break them.   Similarly  with the  United States, which isalready very much inclined to congratulate  itself on its  indemnity policy in China,there will be ample opportunity for contrasting its generosity with our bad  faith.     In short, the Chancellor of the Exchequers proposal, attractive as it is at first sight, cannot be reconciled either with the  general line of our China  policy, whichhas now been announced  to and generally approved by the British people, nor  withthe specific  promises given  in this special matter of   the  indemnity; and  it isparticularly untimely at  this moment, when the Chinese people, after two years of*&apos; Red ** fever, are turning for help and  friendship towards the Anglo-Saxon Powers.     In view of these considerations, the Foreign Office cannot possibly approve anyproposal involving confiscation of  the funds. Further, it is not quite correct to look upon the money deposited in the  Hong Kong and Shanghai  Bank as  money whichis not yet earmarked for any specific purpose. In point of fact, the Buxton AdvisoryCommittee, acting under the 1925 Act,  has  already advised the Secretary of Statethat  &quot; the nucleus  of  the investment  fund (i.e.,  for  permanent  endowment  ofeducation  and other  work after 1945) would  be the unexpended amount receivedfrom the instalments of the indemnity between  December 1922 and December 1926.The  credit balance in  question (including  accumulated  interest) should be abouta million and three-quarters (i.e.. in October 1926).&quot;  The greater part, therefore,of the fund which the Chancellor wishes to confiscate was already accumulated whenthe Committee reported under the terms of the Act, and was allocated by them tocertain purposes, and was subsequently to be invested with accumulated interest insome  useful reproductive  undertaking.   The  Chancellor&apos;s proposal  would beregarded as  a  confiscation of  2 million  for the expenses of the Shanghai defence force.   It would be difficult to argue that utilisation of the funds for the expensesof the defence  force would be  for &quot; educational and other purposes .... beneficial to the mutual interests of His Majesty  and  of the Republic of China.&quot; within  eventhe widest interpretation of  the 1925  Act.  Moreover,  it would be so contrary tothe policy approved by  the  Buxton Committee  as  a  whole, and  it  would be aproceeding so  difficult  for the Chinese members in particular to explain away totheir fellow  countrymen,  that it would almost necessarily involve the resignation ofthe whole  committee.

The following promises have been given :    1.  A verbal  assurance given  to  the Chinese  Acting Minister  for  Foreign        Affairs at Peking on the 20th December, 1922, that &quot; the British Govern-        ment had decided in principle to devote the proceeds of the British share        of the Boxer Indemnity to projects  equally beneficial to China and Great        Britain.&quot;  2.  Written promise to the same effect dated the 29th December, 1922, in a note        addressed by  His  Majesty&apos;s Legation to the  Chinese Foreign Office.        (N.B. This assurance was at once published in the press.)    [17135]                                                       a  2
                                     III.MEMORANDUM ADDRESSED BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL BUXTON, CHAIRMAN    OF THE INDEMNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE,  TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR    FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                       Position of Advisory Committee.    The  Boxer Indemnity dates from  September 1901,  in which year the ChineseGovernment undertook to pay the total sum of  450 million taels as compensationfor losses and military expenses incurred in  connexion with the Boxer rising.  Thepayments were to be made  in  yearly instalments extending over a period of fortyyears.  The British share of the Indemnity (principal  and interest) amounted  toabout  16  million sterling,  and  the annual payment amounts on the average  torather more than  400,000 a year.    These payments were duly made until August 1917, when China declared war on Germany and Austria.   This action brought  to an end the indemnity payments to enemy countries,  while, at the same time,  the Allied Powers (except Russia, whodeferred  onh/ one-third of the amount)  agreed to defer  the indemnity payments  tothem for a  period of five years.    On the expiry of the deferment period, in November 1922, Great Britain, theUnited States of America and the other countries concerned, came to the conclusionthat their claim for indemnity should be cancelled altogether, or that the continuedpayment of the instalments should be applied for the benefit of China.    Each country dealt with the matter in  its own way.    As regards Great Britain, in December 1922 the British Government announced to the Chinese Government that the subsequent instalments of the indemnity wouldbe applied to &quot; such educational and other purposes beneficial to the mutual interestsof His Majesty and of the Republic of China.&quot;  This declaration was subsequentlytranslated  into the  China  Indemnity Act of 1925.    Considerable delay took place in the passing of the Bill, which was not, however,due to any  opposition to the proposal, which  met  with general approval, but was dueto the political situation in Great Britain throughout the years 1923, 1924 and 1925.    If it had not been for these unavoidable delays in no way due to any action onthe part  of the Chinese themselves the Act Avould have been passed in 1923, andwould have been in practical operation and  the money allotted to various purposesbefore the disturbances in China took place.    No division (except one in Grand Committee on a  detail) took place in either house at any stage of the Bill. The proposals of the Bill gave great satisfaction  inChina, and the passing of the Bill was recognised as a  friendly act on the part  ofGreat Britain.3. Promise made by  the  whole British  people, as  embodied in the &quot; China      Indemnity (Application) Act,  1925,&quot; that the &quot; China Indemnity shall,      instead of being paid  into  the Exchequer  .... be applied to such      educational or other purposes, being purposes which are, in the opinion      of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, beneficial to the  mutual      interests of ilis  Majesty and of  the  Republic  of China, as the said      Secretary of  State, after consultation  with  the Advisory  Committee to      be established under this Act, may from time to time determine.&quot;4. This promise was confirmed        (i) by the setting up of the Advisory Committee under the chairman-             ship of Lord Buxton.      (ii) by the sending to China of the committee&apos;s  delegation under the             chairmanship of Lord  Willingdon to study on the spot details             for carrying out  the Act.      This latter step in especial  advertised our Boxer Indemnity promises      in the eyes of the whole world, and especially of China.5. The specific promise made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and      published on  the  26th  May. 1926, to accept the principle of control of      the funds by  a Board of Trustees  in China and  to do his  best to secure      Parliamentary approval to this proposal.
    The Advisory Committee, constituted under the Act for the purpose of advising the Secretary of State as to the best method of applying the funds, was a represen-tative one, and included three distinguished Chinese members.  It came actually into being in December 1925.   The Committee devoted the greatest care and considers-tion to all the questions involved; and appointed a delegation, consisting of three british  and three Chinese members of the committee  (under  the chairmanship ofLord Willingdon), to enquire into the whole position in China itself.    The Advisory  Committee  reported  in  October  192G.   Their  report  and suggestions  were accepted by the Secretary of  State, and published;  and were received with general  approval and appreciation  in China.    The proposal of the committee that a Board of  Trustees in China  should be created  to carry out the proposals of the committee involved an  amendment of theAct of 1925.    It was. at the time, hoped  that the amending Bill would be carried throughduring the autumn  session of  192G.  But, unfortunately,  events in China made it appear expedient to postpone the measure.  The  position  in China went  graduallyfrom bad to worse; and it was finally decided that it would be wiser not to attemptto set up the Board of Trustees  until  the  position of  affairs became more stable.    But though the unfortunate state of affairs in China during the  last two yearsnecessarily postponed  the application of the proposals of  the Advisory Committee,the. delay has not in any way  prejudiced  nor modified  their proposals themselves.As soon as the country settles down they can at once be put into force  Meanwhile.the fund necessary to carry them out is accumulating.    The members of my committee would. I feel sure, view with  grave concern any decision by the Government to appropriate the accumulated fund, or  any  part ofthe indemnity, and to apply it to the purpose of meeting a  portion of  the cost of thedefence force.    Such action would obviously be entirely contrary to the spirit and letter of thedeclaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the  Act of 1925, already quoted.    The main object of applying the  indemnity to the  purposes named aiid to the mutual benefit of Great Britain and China  under the care of a  committee was toshow, in a concrete way, the friendly feeling and  interest of His Majesty*s Govern-ment and of the British people towards China.    The confiscation of the fund, or any portion of it, especially if it were appliedto the cost of the defence force--against which  the  Chinese  themselves have  notceased to protest would be considered by the Chinese as a very unfriendly act, andwould  have a  deplorable and far-reaching effect on  Chinese  opinion.&apos;  Specialemphasis  would be laid  on  the facjt that Great Britain  alone, of  the  powers concerned, had  taken advantage of the disturbances to break faith with the  Chinesein the matter of the application of the indemnity funds.    As regards the position of the Advisory Committee itself, I may point out that,throughout,  the most  cordial relations subsisted  between  the  British and Chinesemembers of the committee, and that the  recommendations of the committee were unanimous.    They  were based on the supposition that some 11 millions would be  available.To expropriate  a considerable portion of this sum would  seriously damage anddislocate the proposals made by the committee.    Further, the proposals were based on  the creation of a  Board of Trustees inChina,  which  was  to consist  of British and Chinese members,  with a Chinesemajority.    The committee were successful  in  obtaining the promise of  service  fromprominent Chinese (six in all) with a view to forming  a  provisional board.  For thereasons already given, further action was, however, suspended.    It is quite certain, however,  that if any proposal to reacquire some of the funds for the purpose of applying them to the cost of the defence force were carried out,these  gentlemen would decline  to serve on the Board of  Trustees (when the timeconies to constitute the board), and that no other Chinese  would  be willing to take their places.    Thus the whole  foundation and superstructure of the proposals of the  committeewould be destroyed.    It is, therefore, clear to me, and  I  think it would be  clear to  my  colleagues(the official  members and  now Lord Willingdon  would of course be neutral) and certainly to the Chinese members, that,  under such circumstances,  they could  nolonger serve any useful purpose,  and they would  feel bound to  tender their resigna-tion and to ask that the reasons for their action should be made  public.
    The members of the committee, and not least myself,  would take such a coursewith entire reluctance and with a feeling of much disappointment;  and we would desire, in so doing, to express our obligation to you, Sir, and to your officials for the constant and unfailing assistance we have received in our heavy and difficult taskduring the last two vears and a half.                                                                 BUXTON.                                      IV.        EXCHANGE OF TELEGKAMS WITH Mis MAJESTY&apos;S MINISTER, PEKING..                                      (A.)              Sir A listen Chamberlain  to Sir M.  Lumpson  (Peking).(No. \:i.)                                     Foreign, Office, January 7, 1928.     II is Majesty &quot;s Government are faced with an urgent financial problem greatlyaggravated by the enormous expenditure to which they have been  put in connexionwith the despatch to and maintenance in China of the Shanghai Defence Force.     They cannot conceal from themselves the fact that it was the situation in  Chinadui ing the past few years, as exemplified in the Shanghai, Shameen, Hankow andNanking incidents, which ultimately necessitated the despatch of these troops for thedefence of British lives  in that country,  and that this situation has in many respectsbeen a continuous repetition of that  which in 1900 led to the exaction by all thePowers concerned of the Boxer indemnities from  the Chinese Government.     It therefore becomes a question for  serious consideration whether His Majesty&apos;sGovernment can continue to pursue that policy which they had adopted in 1922 ofremitting their share of the indemnity  fund, in face of the fresh  provocations andoutrages which they have encountered at the hands of  the Chinese ever since thatdecision was taken/and  whether they are not in these circumstances fully justified in meeting their present financial difficulties by applying the  bulk of this&apos;  fund  to thepurpose of covering the expenses of the Shanghai Defence Force.    The actual proposal which has  been submitted  by  the Chancellor of theExchequer is to appropriate the whole of the sum deposited in the bank to meet partexpense of defence force, which will amount to about  4 million up to  31st march next, as well as future payments so long as force remains in China.    In support of this  proposal  it is urged that our indemnity  proposals do not constitute a contractual  obligation, but were a spontaneous and unilateral offer madebecause change of circumstances  since 1901 made change of polic\- desirable;  thechange between 1922 and 1927 is even  greater, and therefore a further change ofpolicy is perfectly logical; that while anarchy continues in China it is impossibleto use the money for  educational purposes; that even if possible such use would nothave substantial and far-reaching advantages of political and commercial character.such as were claimed for it in 1922;  that being under no obligation to the Chinese.His Majesty&apos;s Government are under obligation to British taxpayer not to part withthe money unless corresponding advantages can be secured; and that even if our offer to the Chinese constituted an irrevocable  pledge, our promise can only be held to mean that the fund will be applied to educational and similar purposes when the situationin China admits of a  reasonable scheme being put in force.    While I feel that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have complete justification for adopting this course, I am bound to take into due consideration the probable effect which such a step would have upon  my whole China policy.  The main questionswhich I must consider in this connexion are :  (1) How this proposal will affect thegeneral policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government  are endeavouring to carry out inChina;  (2) what effect it will have on the general and particular political, commercial and other elements of importance in that country; and (3) how it will react on Britishinterests there.    Please give this question your urgent and careful consideration, and  let me havea full expression of your views thereon as soon  as possible.
o     This refers to alternative suggestions  regarding settlement of  British claims out of  indemnityfunds:    (a) That money for this purpose bo appropriated by a free vote in the House of Commons; or   (b) That, after the Amending Hill has been passed, the Chinese themselves bo persuaded to suggest        allocation of funds for this imrpose.                                      (B.)      Sir M.  Lampson to Sir Austen Chamberlain. [Received January 20.)(No. 53.)                                           Peking, January 20, 1928.     Your telegram No. 13.     t.   I find great difficulty in advising one way or the other.   Arguments on bothsides are so strong and it  is really matter of individual opinion.   On balance,  my view at  the moment is as follows :     2.   Whilst fully appreciating Treasury point of view, 1  gravely doubt wisdom of proposed reversal of policy.   If we had not already definitely committed ourselves and  blazoned  our decision abroad matters might be different, but we have to dealwith facts as  they are now and not as we would have them  be.  Just  at the timewhen there are distinct indications of revulsion of feeling all  over China in our favour.  I fear that there might be a strong and  immediate reaction against us andusual cry that we made original promise  with our tongue  in our cheek.  Anti-British  agitators, who are only dormant, would be the first  to take advantage oftiiis. and it is  to be borne in mind  that neither Russia nor any other Power has goneback on its promise to devote its indemnity funds to use in China.  For details see my despatch No. 2266  last year.    3.   Temptation to use this money  to recoup the British taxpayer is very strong.But on the long view I would urge desirability of continuing to mark time  until we see how things develop.  Temptation to recoup British  claimants in China is evenstronger.  Only to-day 1 received deputation of British merchants from Tien-tsinwho are now on their beam ends through non-payment of bond  fide debts due to themfor about 20  million  dollars of railway  and  other material supplied  to ChineseGovernment Department and not  paid  for though  firms have to pay interest  to  the banks.   They urged use of Boxer funds for their relief.   I explained political reasons why  this seemed  to  me at  present unwise, especially possible, handle it might giveRussian  propaganda,  and  they seemed to appreciate this.  In  this connexion, hasthe idea put forward in my telegram No. 1673* yet received consideration? I submit that it should  not be lightly discarded.    4.   Replies to your specific questions to the  best of my ability thus are:  (1) Itmight well  give  Russia opportunity  to  make  political capital against us  at a particularly inopportune moment: (2) I believe it would have adverse effect thoughit might wear off in time; (3)  same  as (2), but I am  of the opinion that matter shouldbe decided on political  rather than  economic grounds.    5.    Meanwhile on the authority contained in  your  telegram No. 645 last yearI am letting  the idea  percolate in Chinese  circles that  patience of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is not inexhaustible, and that if British interests continue to be penalisedBoxer Indemnity may  not  be returned after  all.   But we must never forget that ifwe were  in fact to reverse, our policy there is  always possibility, and I myself believea distinct one, that Chinese might  simply  cancel all further payments, in which case it might  prove awkward to force them  to  continue payment.
