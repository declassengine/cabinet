Copy No.   3QCP. 37 (28).NOTES ON MR. AMERY!S TOUR IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.    IN  November  I circulated  to the Cabinet  a memorandum  received  fromMr. Amery on the position in South Africa.  I now circulate a memorandum whichhe has written on his tour of Australia and New Zealand.                                                                      S.  B.    February 8, 1928.             Some Notes on my Tour in Australia and New Zealand.                                 AUSTRALIA.     1 ARRIVED at Albany, in Western Australia, on the 10th October and sailed from Sydney for New Zealand on the 17th November.  I spent a day or two at eachSlate capital (somewhat longer at both Melbourne and Sydney), and in every casetook part in  one or more conferences with the members of the State Cabinet.  the subjects discussed were  chiefly migration and marketing, but constitutional issues,such as the appointment and power of Governors, honours, &amp;c,  were raised both inQueensland and New South Wales.  In addition to this. I had more intimate personalconversations with the various Premiers and their Ministers, one or more of whomaccompanied me at every stage of my journey through each State.  One or, other ofthe Federal Ministers and one or more members of the Development and MigrationCommission similarly accompanied me throughout my tour.  At Canberra 1 had aseries of conferences with Mr. Bruce  and the Development and Migration Commis-sion on migration  questions and conferred with the Cabinet both  collectively  andindividually.  I also addressed an informal secret session of both Houses on various issues of foreign and  Imperial policy, and both there and at the  State capitals,  and while travelling, was afforded the opportunity of  meeting a large number of  Federaland State members.     The greater part, however, of my time was spent in seeing the country  districts in order to form some idea of the possibilities of development in connexion both withmigration and with marketing.  In Western Australia I visited the orchard countryand the group settlement area (dairying) of the extreme south-west and the rapidly expanding new wheat area further east. In South Australia and Victoria  I visited the fruit-growing irrigation settlements along the Murray River,  and saw  enough of the great  Hume  Weir being  constructed  near Albury, and of  the locks andpumping stations lower  clown, to realise the magnitude of the project for utilising the Murray both for irrigation and navigation.   In Victoria, I also visited  the drought-stricken wheat  area of the Mallee. country immediately south of the river and of the Wimniera. In New South Wales I divided my time between the sheep and wheat country of the Riverina and the fertile dairy country of the  North Coast, while in Queensland my visit was confined to the maize and dairying districts of the south-eastern corner of this immense State.     Unlike South  Africa,  Australia has no racial problems  to  complicate  herpolitical  issues.  Such  as they are, those issues are, in the  main, economic  ordominated by their economic aspect.   Imperial relations afford  no  real subject forcontroversy, even if the Opposition in the Federal Parliament feels  itself obliged to criticise perfunctorily whatever line Mr. Bruce may take in that sphere. The con-conclusions of the last  Imperial Conference are, perhaps, more clearly understood andmore generally  accepted in  Australia in all their  implications  than in  other      117202]                                                        B
 Dominions, like South Africa or the Irish Free State, where all the stress is laid on the rights and little on the responsibilities and duties of the Imperial relationship, or New Zealand, where the new conception of that relationship is very imperfectly realised and the old conception of loyalty to the Mother Country still holds the held.    For the time being, too. the constitutional issue of Commonwealth versus State powers is in the background.  For one thing, there is a growing realisation that the terms of the Constitution matter less than the spirit in which it is worked, and that there is a large field  for co-operation  both  as between the Commonwealth and the States, and as between the States themselves, outside the provisions of the Common- wealth Act.   The new arrangements for  adjusting State and  Federal borrowings, the co-ordination  of  settlement and  development through the  Development  and Migration  Commission, the inter-State agreements for  the irrigation and  general opening  up of the Murray River  Valley,  are all typical of a  new  spirit which Mr. Unices statesmanship has done much to foster.   For another, there is, in some of the larger  States  like New South  Wales at least, a feeling that the problem of building up some efficient instrument of local self-government within the State, andof getting  away from the centralizing monopoly  of  great centres like Sydney, is possibly more urgent than the adjustment of  relations between Sydney and Canberra. It is conceivable that the growth of  a provincial system within the States may prove a necessary preliminary stage to any radical recasting of the Australian Constitution.    The shifting both of Parliament and of  the Administration to Canberra is  nowan accomplished fact.  Melbourne and Sydney are contemptuous of the new &quot; bushcapital,&quot; and  there is a certain amount of criticism of the waste of money involvedin the building of a new city in the middle of nowhere.   But there is also a widespreadfeeling that it will be  a good thing  for Australia^ legislators to get away from the atmosphere and influences of a great urban and industrial centre like Melbourne andto live in surroundings which will remind  them that Australia is primarily agricul-tural and is a great empty continent clamouring for development and population.With  its beautiful natural  situation,  bracing  climate,  and  well-planned lay-out,Canberra ought in a few years to become quite an attractive little city.  .    The only serious issue of a primarily  political character recently has  been  thatcreated by the claim of extremist Labour leaders, like Mr. Lang in New South Wales,to subvert the whole system of free  constitutional government in order to substitute the irresponsible autocracy of an  extra-parliamentary  caucus.  Mr. Lang,  more directly and cynically than any of  his predecessors, took the  view that he  was in office to carry out the wishes of the Labour Caucus, and that any means were justifi-able to that end.  His attempt to swamp the Upper House in order to secure itsabolition was  frustrated by the refusal of  the Governor. Sir  Dudley de  Chair, to nominate any  more members to the Legislative Council once Mr. Lang*s  intentionbecame obvious.  The Governors attitude has been justified not only by the resultof the recent New South Wales election, but  by public opinion throughout Australiagenerally, and has strengthened the sentiment in favour of retaining an impartialGovernor from outside.   It is clear  that face to face with Ministers prepared to goto any  length  in  dealing with constitutional issues, and  entirely indifferent to parliamentary government as such,  the reserve powers of the Crown as trustee for the constitution and the public interest may, in certain contingencies, have to beexercised more frequently than in the last  generation.  Meanwhile, the defeat of the Lang  Ministry has been  welcomed by the  other Labour  Governments in Australia, which at this moment are in the hands of  meliorate and  reasonable leaders, and thegeneral tendency of the  Labour Party in Australia  would seem to be away  fromextremism.  It is significant, however, that Mr. Bavin, the very capable new Premierof New South Wales, is committed to an early reconstruction of the Second Chamber which will give it a fixed composition and make impossible its overriding or abolition by the executive of the  day.    The main economic issues are those  created  by Australian  labour and tariff policy.  The principle of the maintenance of a high standard of living by legislation, including tariff protection against  competition by lower paid  workers, is common to all  schools of Australian political thought.  Up to a certain point that  principle has justified itself in  Australian  experience.  The standard of comfort and  well- being of the Australian industrial  worker,  at any rate  of the unskilled worker, is higher than anywhere else in the world, and at the  same time a very considerable range of industries, many of them  on a large scale  and very  efficiently conducted, has been built up  under the tariff.   Basing himself  on  these facts, the Australian workman has come to believe that, regardless of the efficiency of his work,  any
standaid of wages or hours that he would like to have  can he secured for him by legislation or by the arbitration court, and that the field of his employment can beindefinitely extended by further measures of protection.   His belief is widely shared,or acquiesced  in to avoid  trouble, by manufacturers,  judges  of  the  IndustrialArbitration  Court and politicians.  But it ignores certain essential limiting factorsof the whole situation.  One is that the maintenance of a high standard of living and nf advanced social conditions is only possible in the long run if it is accompaniedby a high level of productive efficiency.  In the last resort  no community can consumemore than it produces, or enjoy the good things of life without creating them.  Theother  is that protection is not a  panacea of  universal  application and unlimitedefficacy, but  an economic expedient which has to be adjusted to the special conditionsof each community.  There is an obvious justification for a  reasonable and progres-sive encouragement of  industrial  development in  Australia by a protective tariff.The mistake has lain  not  in  the attempt to  build  up  Australian  manufacturingproduction,  but in the indiscriminate eagerness to protect any and every conceivableindustry simultaneously without considering the possibility of its efficient develop-ment  in so limited a market, or the cumulative effect of a number  of injudiciouslyapplied  duties on the working costs either of the industries which it would be worthwhile  protecting or of the vital export industries of the country.    It is this crude exaggeration and travesty of essentially  justifiable principles which is causing the  gravest concern  to serious students of Australia s future.There is a growing realisation of the  fact that Australian industrial standards areartificial and are only maintained out of the pocket and at the expense of the primaryproducer.   Wool  and wheat  practically sustain the  whole economic  fabric.   Andthey are able to do so largely because Australian labour  conditions do not  apply tothem.   No minimum rates  or maximum hours  of work apnly  to the farmer or hishired  hands.  Even the shearer, though highly organised and well paid, is a piece-rate worker. Alining, where  Australian trade  union conditions apply in full force.has dwindled away in the most alarming fashion.  The  farmer fears that his own industry may  go the  same way.  if not by the direct introduction of trade unionconditions, by the steady increase  in the cost  of his working plant and of livinggenerally,    ft  is this situation which not  only  has led. in the  political field, to thegrowth of the Country  Party as a revolt against the dominance of the great urbancentres,  but  has in many quarters more recently been responsible for a great deal of hard  thinking.  In this respect, at least, there has. I  think, been a Considerablechange since the Lord Privy Seal, on his return from Australia a year ago, circulatedhis searching and disquieting memorandum on the economic prospect in Australia(CP.  6  (27)&apos;).    Air. Bruce and the majority of his colleagues are. I  believe,  fully aware of the dangers of the situation and anxious to remedy them as far as  may be politicallyfeasible.  What he would like, on the fiscal side, would be a  thorough-going revisionof the tariff giving effective protection to  a carefully  selected  list of industries, butabandoning  the attempt to protect any and every industry great and small.  how much  he will be able to do in this direction in face of the  vested interests alreadycreated  and of the opposition of his &quot;Minister of Customs. Air. Pratten, is  anotherquestion.  The aspect of this question with which I think he is most likely to dealboldly is the Navigation Act.  That measure  not only hampers Australians export and import  trade by preventing British  ships from picking up coast-wise traffic.thus increasing their working costs, but  also adds greatly to the  cost of internaltransportation as between the different Australian Slates, and is a serious obstacle to the development of  the more isolated States, such  as Western Australia andTasmania.   It is quite possible that. Air. Bruce may make the drastic amandment, oreven the abolition, of the Navigation Act a plank in his platform at the next election.    The main field of  political contention, however, will probably  be the field oflabour conditions generally,  and  more particularly  the power  of the arbitrationcourts, and  in this  ease the  contest will  be waged in the  State Parliaments andAdministrations quite as much as in the Federal sphere.  In both New South wales and South Australia the new Nationalist-Country Party coalitions  are resolved tomake  a  determined effort to bring their railways and other  Government services onto an economic basis, and  in  both these  States, as well as at Canberra, there is a growing conviction that the whole, system of so-called judicial arbitration needs over-hauling.   Australian  experience,  certainly,  is  not  any  encouragement  for theintroduction of compulsory arbitration into our industrial machinery.  The system would appear to encourage strikes for the sake of getting decisions which are in      [17202]                                                       B 2
practice unenforceable when not  palatable to the men.  Judges consequently tend,in order to avoid failure, or the odium connected with decisions  regarded as  hostileby large sections of the community, to give something of what is asked irrespective of any real economic justification.  This is apart from individual cases of judges witha  violently  partisan  bias  in favour  of  the extreme Labour  contentions, such as mr.  Justice  Piddington in New South  Wales, who recently included compulsorymembership of a trade union as a  condition of one of his awards.  When Mr. Bavin&quot;s-Govcrnment  decided, against their  predecessors, that the  new child endowmentscheme should be additional, not to the  old basic wage assessed on the assumptionthat the worker should receive enough  for the maintenance of a wife and  two children,but to a new basic wage for a man and his wife only, the same  impartial authorityretorted by promptly fixing the new basic wage at the same rate as the  old, which hehad fixed himself only a few months before! This clement of irresponsibility,  takingno account either of economic fads or of  the wishes of Parliament, is accentuated bythe overlapping jurisdiction of State and Federal  judges, who  lay down differentwages and hours for the same industries, the men. of course, always insisting on themost favourable feature of  each decision  being enforced.    On these various economic issues  Australia seems to me to be ncaring a turning-point.   If Mr. Bruce  is prepared to make the attempt to tackle  his problems boldlyand  is  supported  by  the public  at the  next  election. Australia may  yet avoid  thefinancial crisis which Lord  Salisbury foresaw in his memorandum.  Failing that, the reconsideration  of Australia^  economic  policy  will  come only  after  the hardexperience of a  severe set-back.   But the set-back  will only be temporary.  Thenatural resources of Australia are too great and her people  have, too  much  funda-mental common-sense  not to profit by  their mistalces.    It would have been obviously undesirable for me to deal with these matters of domestic  controversy directly in my public  speeches.  As  in  South   Africa, Iendeavoured  to  give a  new setting to these issues by drawing  the picture of what might be achieved, for Australia  in particular, as well as for the  rest of the Empire,by a  policy of Imperial co-operation, more especially in the economic field.  My aimwas to awaken a wider conception of  Australians development in the light of whichproblems, such  as  those of tariffs and migration, could be considered as part of abroad Imperial policy, and not merely from a narrow and purely local standpoint.There is no doubt that what we have already done through our existing preferences,of which I naturally  made the  most  I  could, and through the work of the empire marketing Board,  the  importance of which  is keenly realised in Australia, hasalready exercised a considerable effect in  widening Australians outlook, and nothing could be of greater help to  Mr. Bruce in his efforts to bring about a modification ofAustralians fiscal and navigation  policy than  any further advance which wo canourselves make in the direction of Imperial Preference.    A great  part  of  my  speeches was  naturally  taken  up with  the  subject of migration. While all parties profess  to be eager to see  the population of Australiaincreased, the Australian working man is profoundly suspicious of  all immigrationas calculated to  create unemployment, or, at any rate,  to diminish the shortage oflabour on which  he relies to help the maintenance of an artificial wage standard, andhis attitude influences  the practical action not. only of the Labour Party but of everyAustralian Government except that of Western Australia.   In  part,  this attitudearises from the impression, for which  there was some justification in the past, thatour only object in promoting migration is  to get rid of our own unemployed and dumpthem, to sink or swim, in Australia.  My main object, therefore, was  to emphasise the fact that our policy was not  one of transferring our unemployed, as such, toAustralia but of co-operating with  the Australian Governments  to develop  theresources of Australia for the mutual benefit of both countries.   The successful  settlerwas, I always argued, to be regarded not as  a competitor in our labour marketpushed  out onto tho Australian  labour market, but, in so far as he created  freshwealth and spent the product of that wealth on Australian and British  goods,  as an employer both of Australian and of British labour.  I  believe, from this  point of viewof removing  misunderstanding and  creating  a better  appreciation of  the  whole problem, both my public speeches and  my private discussions with the various  StateGovernments have proved useful.    The most  important  business I had to  transact while  in  Australia  was,naturally, tho further working out of the  34,000,000 loan agreement.   Under thisagreement wo undertook to provide, between the 1st April. 1925, and the 1st April,1935, a  total amount of  7,000.000, on the basis of a contribution of  150 towards
every 6750  raised by the several Australian  States for certain  defined classes ofdevelopment  and settlement  schemes,  provided during those ten years the Statereceived and found work  for 450,000 newcomers from Great Britain.  Schemes soijir put forward and  approved amount to  only a small portion of the total, about 7,000,000 altogether.  But it is essential to remember that we are under a definiteobligation to find the  rest  of our contributions over the next seven years, as long asAustralia  puts forward schemes which come within the terms of the agreement.  Mychief concern was to  come lo some  understanding with Mr. Bruce  and with theDevelopment and  Migration  Commission  which would insure,  in  the  first  place,thai we should have some  knowledge beforehand of the amounts we are  likely to becalled upon  to pay during the next few years, and  that the expenditure should, asfar as possible, rise gradually to its maximum and then be evenly spread, and.  in thesecond place, that the schemes should  really  be of such  a  character as to  createadditional immigration.  There is a danger that, in some States at least, the  literalterms id&apos; the agreement can be fulfilled by putting forward schemes which ought tobe regarded as part of the  normal development work of the State,  relying on normalimmigration  to meet  the  requirements in  this respect.  On both these  points wearrived at a  complete and  satisfactory understanding which  1 shall bring up in due course, and which will, I trust, commend itself to my colleagues.    The essential  thing to  keep in mind  about the  agreement  is that, while indetail it teems with difficulties and  possibilities of misunderstanding, and can onlybe worked if both sides constantly keep in view the spirit as well as the letter  of ourundertakings, the  interests of Great  Britain and of  the Commonwealth in  it are substantially identical.  We are partners in a great experiment, the object of  whichis  to stimulate the Australian States to take a more active part in the development and peopling of their  territories with a view to carrying Australia over  the present stage id&quot; slow growth to one where growth will  lie rapid and spontaneous.    Of business arising more directly out of the Imperial  Conference, not the leastimportant point was to make sure that any change  in  the system  of communication which eliminated  the  Governor-General as  the channel of communication should be accompanied by the initiation of a regular  and automatic system  of communicatinginformation  to the Governor-General so that, as contemplated by the Conference, heshould be  kept as fully informed as the King  is at home.  On this subject  I  had avery full  discussion with  Lord  Stonehaven and  Mr.  Bruce, and we agreed uponarrangements which  will  insure the Governor-General being much  more fully  andregularly informed on all that passes, by whatever channel  it may  pass, than he everhas been before.   Here, as in South Africa, 1 believe it has been possible to make use of the  Imperial Conference resolutions in order to strengthen the position  of theGovernor-General, and I see  no  reason  whatever to fear that either the  dignity orthe real  influence of the office  has in any way been impaired by recent  developments.    The question of a representative of the British Government  in  Australia  wasalso discussed at  length between us.   Mr.  Bruce&apos;s view was that,  while anythingambitious  or high sounding was out of place, a liaison officer on general epiestions ofImperial policy would he useful, more particularly,  perhaps, if there were a changeof Government in Australia.   He was not inclined to press for an immediate appoint-ment. but  suggested that  we  might reopen  the matter of an actual appointment alittle later, f did not gather that Lord Stonehaven entertained, as against a proposal on this scale, the objections which he had previously expressed in his letters to me to anything in the nature of a British High Commissioner.    Arising out  of the participation of an Australian warship in the work of theFleet in China and more recently in the operations in the Solomon Islands, Mr.  Brucediscussed  with me the   position  of  a Dominion commanding officer under  aBritish Commander-in-Chief  in such cases.  He suggested  that the general guiding principle should  be that wherever the  British Commander-in-Chief considered theneed for action to be so  obvious or so urgent as not to  require reference  to hisGovernment,  the commander of the Dominion force  should  follow  suit, but thatwherever the British Commander-in-Chief felt that political or other considerations were involved which necessitated reference home to his Government  before  taking action, then  the Dominion Commander should also consult his Government.   this seemed to me a reasonable and simple  solution, and I asked Mr. Bruce to put itforward in an official  despatch.    As instructed by the Cabinet, 1  put before Mr. Bruce the inconvenience that theChancellor of the Exchequer would be exposed to if, in a year of exceptional financialdifficulty, lie was obliged to put into suspense account  000.000 of Empire Marketing
Board mono)&apos; which would not be needed for at least another two years.  Mr. Bruce,like General Hertzog, appreciated the force of my arguments, and expressed  theview that, as long as the money was eventually available if required for the develop-ment of the work, he would not regard it as in any way a breach of our pledge if thepresent surplus were put back into the general pool of the year&apos;s finances.     In my discussions with State Ministers I took the view  that nothing which hadtaken place  at the  Imperial  Conference affected  the relations of the States to  theDominions Office or the position and functions of State Governors, and this view wasnowhere  challenged.   While the Queensland Government  formally asked  for  myopinion on the question of local versus &quot; imported *&apos; Governors, I gathered that therewas no  real feeling in Queensland or anywhere else in  Australia for a change of system,  as long as  the States enjoy their present constitutional powers.   recent developments have,  in fact, as I have already mentioned,  strengthened the sentimentin favour of the office being held by some one wdio is obviously outside all domestic,party controversies.     In connexion with recommendations for honours, a point of considerable generalimportance was raised with  me by Mr. Bavin.  New South Wales some years agopassed a  parliamentary resolution  against honours.  The vote seems to have been asnatch one. and the Government of the day shortly afterwards put forward recom-mendations in regard of it, but were  told by the Colonial Office that a  rescindingresolution would be required.  Mr. Bavin put forward  the  view that after a  lapse of years such as had taken place it was for the Government immediately responsible to decide whether an old  resolution was to be regarded  as  still of any effect.   Hecould no  doubt, he declared, carry a rescinding resolution.   But it would involve atiresome  and  embarrassing  debate, and  the right  constitutional  method, in  hisopinion,  was to act in accordance with what he believed  to be the view of  hisParliament,  leaving the Opposition to challenge his action if  they wished.   Hiscontention was strongly supported by Mr. Bruce  and  by  Lord Stonehaven. and appeared to me not only constitutionally sound,  but also eminently desirable as a precedent for  other Australian  States and  for Dominions like Canada and SouthAfrica, where the reintroduetion of honours  would be made far more  difficult, if  not impossible, if  it had to be preceded by formal resolution. It may be of interest to note that both General Hertzog and Mr.  MacCormack. the Labour Premier ofQueensland,  expressed themselves  in   private conversation  as  in favour,  at  some suitable time, of the reintroduetion of nondiereditary honours as long as they were confined  to public  servants,  men  of  science. &amp;c..  and  were not  given  for partyservices.                                NEW ZEALAND.    I landed at Auckland from Sydney on the 21st November and sailed from therefor Vancouver on the 20th Decembeu.   Apart from a weelcs holiday in the SouthernAlps (in  Australia  I never even got a Sunday off), the rest of the time was givento visiting every centre or district of  any importance  in both islands, including astay of four days at the capital, Wellington.  I had several conferences with  theCabinet  on Imperial  relations  and migration,  as well  as many useful talks withMr. Coates,  both at Wellington and at Auckland, where he came to meet me andsec  me off.  As at  Canberra, I addressed a secret session  of Parliament in this instance a regular sitting of the House of Commons,with the  Upper House attendingin the Gallery on foreign and Imperial affairs.    If Imperial sentiment is strong in Australia, in New Zealand it is a  passion,almost a  religion. Alone of the Dominions, New Zealand is much more interested in her  Imperial,  than in her  national, status.  The various concessions made to dominion nationalism  at the last Imperial Conference have created no enthusiasmin New Zealand, and she has  rather ostentatiously decided not to follow the example of  the other Dominions in such matters of form as the  change in channels ofcommunication.  This &quot; colonial &quot; attitude, as it would be styled in other Dominions,probably diminishes to some extent  the influence which New  ZealancFs  examplemight exercise on other Dominions.  The fine lead she has given over Singapore,  theconsistent support she gives  to British foreign policy, the  recent very  substantial increase  of preference  in her tariff, would all, I  think, count for more in the otherDominions if  New   Zealand  could identify herself a  little more  with  them  by accepting their point of view on the nature of the new Imperial relationship.  Mychief aim, in public and private, in so far as I dealt with the problem, was to  try to make  it clear that the new relationship implied not a loosening of the bonds of
Empire,  but a more  definite  fixing of the responsibility for the maintenance  ofImperial unity upon each member of the partnership.    The economic  problem in New Zealand  is much simpler than in Australia.Labour legislation  has followed very similar lines, and  compulsory arbitration  is the rule of the day over the greater part  of  industry.  Hut there are no  huge urbanaggregations,  the  small  farmer  is  very  much  in the ascendant politically, and arbitration would  seem to have been both more  conservatively exercised ami totterobeyed than in Australia.  The recourse to the  tariff  as  a ready solution  of  everylabour dispute is precluded  both by the smallness of the  home market, which narrowlylimits the range of industries which can  be protected, and by the attitude of theGovernment in keeping consistently to a moderate fiscal policy  based  on  general considerations of New Zealand*s economic position.  The weak side of that  position,indeed, is its excessive dependence on the export market,  and more particularly  on one market,  that of Great Britain, which takes 77 per cent, of  New Zealand&apos;s exporttrade.   The loss of consuming  power in Great  Britain  consequent on last year*industrial disturbances had a most serious effect on New Zealand,  which  was furthercomplicated  by a quarrel between the butter producers and the London dealers.  Themost effective  remedy in the long run for this  weakness would be to strengthen theNew  Zealand  home market by an increase  of population.   The immediate effect,however, of  the unemployment resulting from last year&quot;s depression was to create inthe mind  of the New Zealand  public something  in the  nature of a  panic  aboutimmigration.  In deference to this, practically all State-aided  immigration  has been suspended, although  Ministers  admitted  to me that  hardly  any of  the  assistedimmigrants were included among the unemployed.    In discussing  the matter  with Ministers and  in public,  I did what I could  to lay stress on the essential point that a migrant  placed in productive work is a creatorof employment and that it is only the unsuitable  and unplaced  migrant  who canaggravate the local unemployment problem.  But  I did not  attempt to press ministers to reopen immigration at once, and chiefly confined myself  to discussing the  improve-ment of the  general arrangements  for migration, and more particularly for helpingpublic school-boy settlers.  My  impression  is that, with  reviving  prosperitv. thepresent  timidity on the subject will pass  away, and that New Zealand will  againabsorb at least as many immigrants annually as  in  past years.    As  regards the political future, Mr. Coates&apos;s Government is. for the  moment.passing through the period of disillusionment and indiscipline which usually attendunduly large majorities.  The introduction of  a Bill to modify the conditions underwhich a  referendum is at present taken  on prohibition  at every general election )revealed the fact that on several points many  of Mr. Coates&apos;s supporters, and  evensome of his colleagues, had  pledged themselves to the prohibitionists  in  a  sensecontrary to his proposals.   For the moment the situation has  been eased by a dead-lock between the two Houses, the Council having restored  the  Bill to something likethe shape  in which the Prime  Minister introduced it.  The prohibitionists. who arevery  powerful, are threatening to take their revenge on Mr. Coates  at the  nextelection.  But it is doubtful if they will do much.  Mr. Coates, if no great  speaker and rather lacking in experience, is generally liked and  trusted, and there is no effectivealternative.  Mr. Holland, the leader of the Labour Party, is eloquent but not reallyeffective, and Mr. Wilford, the leader  of the National  (formerly  Liberal) Party,  seven more colourless.General.    In South  Africa I  had a definite special task which took precedence of anyother : to  help, so far as it was possible for me to do so without laying myself opento the charge of interfering in domestic politics, to create  an atmosphere favourable to a settlement of the flag controversy, and to prevent the good  work of the ImperialConference from being undone by a bitter racial quarrel.  In Australia and NewZealand my objects, apart  from&apos; following up  points  arising from the ImperialConference,  and transacting certain matters of  current business  &quot;with  the various governments, were of a general character.  They were, to  learn what I  could abouteconomic and political conditions, and to strengthen the personal  touch between theBritish Government, and not  only  the Governments, but  also the public,  in  theseDominions.   From  these points of view  I  am  well satisfied  with  the results ofmy experiment.   At an  Imperial  Conference we  get  to  know  something of thepersonality of two or three Ministers  of  each Dominion; the Dominions,  outside
 those Ministers, learn nothing at first-hand about ourselves.  On the  present tour 1  have been able,  not only  to study at first-hand the economic  situation  and the prospects of development,  from the point of view of trade and migration, but also to make the personal acquaintance of almost every Minister, and of a very large number of Members of ten Parliaments, as well  as of  leading men in  every part of the Dominions which I have so  far visited.  On the other hand, in the course of at least 100 speeches in each Dominion, many of them broadcast, I have been able to present. the British point of view  on Imperial problems, and, incidentally, some account of the way in which we are grappling with our difficulties at home, and so have done something to give the personal touch to what otherwise reaches their  public only through the medium of summarised  press  messages,  sometimes  distorted, still more often rendered uninteresting or  unintelligible by extreme  compression.  To some extent these defects will, no  doubt, be remedied by cheaper cable or wireless  services, and by Empire-wide broadcasting.  But my experience has convinced me that what I have been doing during these last few- months cannot be regarded as an exceptional experiment, but that  it will, in future, be an essential part of  the duties of any Secretary of State  for Dominion Affairs  to visit the various Dominions while  in office in order  to maintain personal  touch  between  the Governments and peoples ofthe Empire in the interval between  Imperial  Conferences.                                                                    L.  S. A.    December  1927.
