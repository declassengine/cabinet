      MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR  INDIA.   I circulate  a copy  of an official telegram, dated 24th January 1928, from theGovernment of India,  in which  they raise three questions covered  by the cabinet decisions of the 22nd December, on the Indianisation of the Indian Army.  The tirstrelates to the stage at which tho proposed change  in  the form of commission shouldbe given effect ;  the second io  the announcement of a maximum  number of vacanciesat Woolwich ;  and the  third to  the  method  of employing Indians  who succeed in passing out of Cranwell.  The first, though it attracted less attention than the others in the discussions  of the Government of India&apos;s  proposal, will  be found to be themost important.   (I) The Government of India proposed that Indian officers from Sandhurst should cease to receive the full  King&apos;s  Commission, and should bo given  a King&apos;s  IndiaCommission, at the point when a steady supply of Indian officers in increased numbersappears to  be assured,  and some, at least, of the Imlianising  units are completelyorganised on the British pattern, or are  in a fair way to  becoming  so, when it can besaid that the nucleus of a  &quot; Dominion Army&quot; exists.  The decision  recorded by theCabinet in  para. 23 of CP. 320 (27) was, &quot; We agree with the Government of  india that, under their present  proposals, India ought to  be  put on  the  same footing inthis respect as the Dominions.   We consider, however, that it  woidd be proper tomake the change now, when the number of  Indians already holding the full King&apos;commission is still small.&quot;  So far, the  difference between the two appears to lie oneof expediency  rather than of principle.   But the Government  of  India&apos;s proposal was an integral part, of a larger scheme.  They contemplated  an  announcement  that theultimate goal  of Indianisation was the creation of a self-contained Dominion Army.It would logically follow from such an  announcement that a change in the form of commission would be  inevitable ; and  it would also follow most naturally, though not in this  case  inevitably, that  the change should take  place when the Governmentof India could point to the existence of a nucleus of the Dominion Army in the shape of one or more units organised  on the British pattern.  The Cabinet, however, decidedthat the use  of the term &quot;Dominion Army&quot; must  be avoided, and  restricted thescope of the  announcement to a statement that the Governments policy is to give better opportunities for  the  advancement  of Indian officers   in the  developmentof a force within the Indian Army officered  by Indians.   The Government of  Indianow represent in effect that if they are  restricted to an announcement in those terms,they can advance little  or  no  convincing reason to justify an immediate change towhat will,  wrongly but  inevitably, be  regarded as an inferior  type of commission.Consequently, they  ask  that  the change in the  form  of  commission  should be postponed,  and  the  greater  part  of  their  telegram  is directed to show   thatpostponement will  not  result  in serious  inconveniences.  On  this -qSoint  I  agreewith them  for reasons which will be given below.  But  they also proceed to suggestthat no intimation, or as little as possible, should be given at present  that a changein the form of commission may ultimately result from the policy.  1 do  not believethat it would  be wise, or oven fair, to prospective Indian candidates for the Army,to suppress that fact if it  can  be avoided.  The problems which I therefore ask mycolleagues  to  Consider  are, first,  whether they would  assent   to a  less restrictedformula than that embodied in their previous decision ; and secondly, whether in anycase they will agree to  a postponement  of tho  change in the form  of commission.    On tho  first, the difficulty felt by my colleagues was confined to the use of the term&quot; Dominion&quot;  in direct relation  with a feature of  the Indian polity.   I may explain that the term &quot;Dominion Army &quot; has hitherto been used in official discussions merely as  a  convenient way of  describing the  type of  self-contained, homogeneous  andexclusively Indian force which the policy of Indianisation  is designed  to  produce.From  that point of  view any other suitable  term  or  periphrasis, if it can bo found,      2561   100 2.2S    TThia Document is the Property  of His Britannic majesty  &apos;s Government.&quot;)                   Printed for the  Cabinet.  6th February 192S.SECRET.CP. 29 (2S).                    Indianisation of the Indian  Army.             d                       (Reference para. 23 of CP. 326/27.)
INDIA  OKKIOE,   Ctlt February 1028.Dl UK EN II HAD.would servo the purpose  equally  well.  1  have  discussed  tho matter  in  privatecorrespondence with the Viceroy, and circulate copies of telegrams, from which it willhe seen that we have agreed  provisionally on a formula which on the one hand wouldgive the Government  of India  latitude to expound  the full  scope of our policy, andon the other  hand  is,  I believe, free from the objections  taken  by  my colleagues  tothe use of the term *&apos; Dominion Army.&quot;  The phrase I suggest for their acceptanceis italicised in the  following sentence, which  1 woidd  propose lo substitute  for the penultimate sentence of para. 22 of the Cabinet Report as  it now stands:         &quot;In  these  circumstances we see  no objection  to an announcement that tho     Governments  -policy  contemplates that, as  India progresses towards  full, self-     government within the Ein pi re, there mag lie  in process of development an army     of the same  character as the Dominions Armies, organised on  a national basis     aud officered hg Indians, provided that it, is definitely required,&quot; &amp;c.Tho object is  to  describe the  policy  in comprehensive  terms  while  avoiding the dangerous connotations which may  attach lo particular words.    The second problem, whether the change in  the form of commission should bopostponed for  the  present, resolves itself,  to  my mind,  into  a matter of practicalexpediency, and I can find no  effective answer  to the arguments  advanced  by theGovernment  of India  in  the  first three paragraphs  of  their telegram.   I  attachparticular importance  to tho argument that so long as we require  Indian cadets  topass through Sandhurst, and so long as we continue to employ them in an organisationindistinguishable from the remainder  of the  Indian  Army,  it  would   be  unfair  toconfer upon them a restricted type  of commission.  A Canadian  officer, for example,can qualify for a commission amid  familiar surroundings  in his own country, and heis thereupon posted to  a local force which already  exists to receive him.  If he were required to come to  Englaud in  order to pass through Sandhurst, and were thereafterappointed to a force  indistinguishable  from the  Imperial  Land  Forces,  I  cannotbelieve that  he could lie expected to acquiesce in  the grant, of  a local form  of commission ;  and 1  do  not  think wo nhould  ask the Indian to  do what we could not ask the Canadian  to do, especially as wo insist that Indians are not to be entitledhereafter  to more  than olfieors  of  tho  Dominions  Forces in  respect  of powers of command.    I would  urge, therefore, that  the decision contained in para. 22 of  CP. 320 (27)should IK; modified as suggested  above, and that, as regards para. 23, tho Governmentof India&apos;s proposal  as to  the stage at which tho form  of commission  should  bochanged should be accepted.   (2) The Cabinet&apos;s decision as recorded in.the last, part of para. 27 of  CP. 320 (27)is &quot; until, however, it definite scheme has been agreed upon, il would  be premature to come to any decision as to tho  number to be admitted annually &quot; (to Woolwich).In para, ii of their telegram the Government of India ask to be  permitted to announce a definite  number as a maximum, subject to their evolving a suitable scheme for theemployment of Indians commissioned from  Woolwich.  My impression is that mycolleagues objected  to an  announcement that so many vacancies would  be reservedfor  Indians at  Woolwich.   I doubt, whether that objection would apply to a  statement(61  what,  is after  all a fact) that,  tho  Army Council  would  be prepared  to  acceptIndians at Woolwich up to a maximum of six  a year,  which involves no  promise  of reserved vacancies, or even,  in present  circumstances,  of employment on passing outof Woolwich.   1 suggest that the Government of hid ia&apos;s view should  be  accepted.    (.&apos;!) Tho Government of India also  ask  for a decision  on the  alternative  schemefor the employment of Indians who pass out of Cranwell, which was  suggested  inthe  Yiceroy&apos;s telegram of the.  3rd December, circulated with  1.1.A.  0.  I  am   in communication:.with the Air Ministry on this matter, and suggest that if wo can agree on a solution that conforms  with the principles already  laid  down by the Cabinet,I should he authorised lo inform the Government of India accordingly.   The agreedscheme would of course be reported to my colleagues.
                                        O     Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, lo Secretory of State for India,                            dated 2\lh January 1928.   175 S.  Secret.   Your telegram of the 25th December, 3626.   Indian SandhurstCommittees Report.  We are glad  that our proposals have been  so largely accepted.On one point only of importance we would ask Cabinet to reconsider their views.In para. I of your telegram  it is stated  that His Majesty&apos;s Government consider thatit would  be proper to make the change in type of  commission to be held  by indian officers now when number of Indians already holding full  king&apos;s Commission is stillsma.ll.   In  making the proposal contained in para.  1 of our telegram of the .18th july and amplified in our  telegram of the 8th December, we had very fully and carefully considered  (see para.  7 of our Despatch dated  13th October) the  fact  that the longerwe postponed the change the greater would be  the number of  Indian  officers holdingfull  King&apos;s Commission  at  the time of  the  change, and then-lore, in this  respect,change would be  harder  to  make.  But we were convinced  that  this disadvantagewas outweighed  by those which would  ensue if we decided upon  and announced arestricted  type  of  commission before tiny other part of the scheme had come intoeffect.  This conviction  has been  strengthened by learning, as we  have been able todo, the strong feeling that underlay the  recommendations  in  paras. 0 and  39 of  theReport that full King&apos;s Commission should  be maintained.  Two Indian members ofthe Committee were officers commissioned  from the Imperial  Cadet Corps and have experienced in their own careers the disabilities and loss of prestige that accompaniesa restricted type of commission.   Both they aud the other members of the Committeeattached very great importance to the point.   It is certain that, if the change is made at once,  we should lose whatever supportwe could otherwise expect in the Legislature and Press, including  that of european members and newspapers.  So long as Indians  are subjected to exactly the same testsand  training as British officers aud serve in an organisation  indistinguishable fromremainder  of Indian Army, it would be held  illogical and unfair  lo confer upon thema restricted type of commission.  If it were only a question of weathering a storm inthe Legislature and  in the  1&apos;ress  we might  be prepared to face it, although failure to carry any section of  public  opinion  with us in this matter  would undoubtedlyembarrass  us in conduct  of  Government policy as  a whole during  the  session.   Butwe should  be liable to accusation of deliberately denying the scheme a fair  chance by making it  unattractive to recruits  aud  of taking  away with  the one hand what weprofess to offer with the other.  We are ready  to meet and refute  the argument thatthe  principle  of eight  units system implies  invidious  segregation, but,  if  indian officers continue lo serve under that system within the Indian Army and are at thesame time stamped with an inferior type of  commission, it would be  hard  to denythat  this was  segregation in extreme form.  The decision would have a depressing effect on Indians who at  present  hold  or aspire to the King&apos;s Commission, althoughthe former would be personally unaffected.  We anticipate that this sentiment wouldbe worked  upon by political influences to such  an extent as to discourage recruitmentaltogether, and, as we said in para, -1 of our  telegram of the ISth duly, to wreck  thescheme at the outset.   We wish to emphasise that,  if this happens in  other words,  that  if our proposalfails for any reason other than  that  material  for officering the  proposed force turnsout  in fact not. to exist-we shall not have  met  in any degree tho demand forIndianisation,  but will  have to face, in  addition,  a renewed and more reasonableagitation for the immediate establishment, of an Indian  Military College, and probablyfor a lower standard of efficiency than is required of British officers.   2. We turn to the one practical objection to postponing  the  change, namely, thatthe number of officers holding  full King&apos;s Commission will be indefinitely increased.As far as  Indians are concerned, logical and appropriate time to create a distinctivetype of commission analogous  to that  given  to officers  in forces of self-governingDominions would  be  when a distinctive  force  in some degree  analogous to forces inthe Dominions is  securely established and assured  of  a continuous supply of officerrecruits  from  its  own  Military  College.  For the reasons given  in para. 7 of ourDespatch, we wish to introduce change at the stage  indicated  in  our  telegram of the8th  December.  We think  that, the success of  the scheme  and  organisation  of  adistinctive  Indian  force, if  they eventuate,  will  greatly help  to reconcile  indian opinion to  the conditions laid down in the commission.   3. As regards the possibility of Indians  rising  to  positions  in  which they mightindirectly (sic ?iu  due course) command British officers and British troops, we would
point out thai boys entering Sandhurst  under the new scheme will not reach  sucha position until about I960;  that on an average not more than one officer in four orthe Indian Army becomes a Brigadier; that an Indian selected for appointment to a brigade would be ex hypothest an officer lit lo command  a brigade ;  that by that limea  completely Indianisod  Brigade Command would probably be available for him  ifthe scheme  succeeds; and  that  in tiny case  the  problem will arise with respect to indian officers already  holding lull King&apos;s  Commission from about  19IS onwards.We should, however, urge that, as far as  concerns British recruitment, the position is sufficiently safeguarded  by retaining eight units principle of Indianisation by units,and  that  it  should not  be  beyond  the capacity  of the  Government of the day lodevise meaus for dealing, 30 years hence, with the limited problems described above.    I.  Wo accordingly suggest  that, as wc  are not now to announce that  DominionArmy  is  the goal, or to  refer to Dominion Army at all, wo  should not  say anythingabout  an altered type of commission, but, if pressed  to make a  definite statement,should say that no change  is proposed at present, aud that  it. will bo time enough toconsider  conferring a distinctive  type  of  commission when Indians  have takenadvantage of enlarged opportunities now offered lo them, and when  the new force isa  securely-established fact.   When these conditions prevail,  they  would probablyjustify or, indeed, necessitate establishment of au Indian  Sandhurst.   o.  As regards Woolwich vacancies, wo are certain  to  be pressed lo slat,: vacanciesavailable, ami told that offer will be an empty one if these are to  be restricted to oneor two.  We urge, therefore, that we may be permitted  to announce definite  numberas maximum, subject to our  evolving suitable scheme described  in  para. 7  of yourtelegram.  With regard to Cranwcll, as no Indian Air Unit exists  at present to whichIndian officers could be posted, it would be sufficient to announce that Indians will lieeligible for admission to Cranwell, and that number of vacancies will be fixed as soonas a satisfactory scheme  for their eventual employment  in  an Indian  Air Unit hasbeen completed.  But we should much  prefer to receive decision  of  Ills. Majesty&apos;sGovernment on alternative scheme referred to in  para. S of your telegram in time forannouncement, as we are sure to be pressed on the subject.    G.  On receiving reply to this telegram, we will consider  occasion and  manner inwhich to announce  conclusions to the Assembly, and  will inform you as early aspossible  beforehand.  We  shall be  grateful  for very  early reply  in  view oT  theAssembly meeting early next month.  Telegram from Secretary of Stale for India Lo Viceroy, dated 27th January 1928.   25&apos;.).  Private and personal.   Your official telegram of  24th January, No. 175 S.,on Indianisation.  I see force of your arguments  for postponing change in  formof commission  as you  propose,  but I  still  think  it  very desirable  to  announcedefinitely  that  our  policy  will sooner  or later  involve that  change,  and I  doubtexpediency of  any ambiguity  on  this  point.  I recognise,  however,  difficulty ofmaking such announcement when you are precluded from defining character of  army which may be expected to  emerge from our policy.  Would  it help you  if 1 tried toobtain modification of Cabinet decision as conveyed in para. 2 of  my official telegramof 20th December,  No. 3020, in  the following sense : &apos;: They see no objection toannouncement that Governments policy  contemplates  that  when India attains to full self-government within  the Empire, there may be in process, of development an army of the same character as the Dominions armies,  organised  on a national  basis  andofficered by Indians, provided, &amp;c.&quot; ?   If this would ease your way in announcing now that we contemplate change in commission hereafter, I should  be willing to try to getCabinet to agree to modification in above  sense, and  also to postponement  of changein commission.    1 will also represent  your  views as to  Woolwich.   As  regards  Cranwell, may I make  official, for purpose of further  discussion with air  Ministry, that  part of your private and personal  telegram of  3rd December,No. 50 I S., which begins &quot;1 think that wo  must all agree&quot;  and ends &quot;success orotherwise of this initial  flight &quot; ?   Have you had opportunity of discussing subject with Secretary of State for War ?
j   Telegram from Viceroy lo Secretary of Stale for India, dated -iril February  1928.   No. -10 S.  Private aud personal.  Indianisation.  We have discussed in Councilsuggestions contained in your  private and  personal  telegram dated 27th January.We should  he grateful  for modifications which you propose in Cabinet&apos;s decision asconveyed  in para. 2  of your official  telegram of 25th  December,&apos; with  one  furthersmall modification.   We  think  that expression &quot;when  India  attains to  full self-government within the  Empire&quot; points to a too distant stage, and we would prefer that passage should run &quot;as India progresses  towards full self-government within theEmpire.&quot;    The announcement as thus revised would certainly make it easier for us torefer to contemplated change in  type of commission.  Assuming, as I do,  that cabinet will  now agree to postponement of actual change, in these circumstances we shouldhave  no objection  to making  a  statement  about commissions  in the  Legislature.without waiting to be  questioned  on  the point.  Tho problem  is to find a formulathat will adequately  pave  tho  way for change  when  it takes place, and will not, onthe other hand, affront public opinion  now.   I think it  is  essential that the matter should be  thought out  to  its  full logical conclusion, and  that we should  ourselvesrealise exactly what  results will  bo  before  we make  any  too  precise or positivepronouncement.   The position of India differs, of course, from that of the dominions in that in  the Dominions there are no  British troops and in  India we naturally haveBritish  ami Indian troops  serving side by side.  When Dominions officers do dutyeither  in  England  or  in India,  or  Dominions troops  take  part in active  serviceoperations  alongside  British troops, Dominions officers are at present granted King&apos;commissions to place them on the same footing as British officers.  Indian  opinionwill naturally, when the lime comes, demand that their officers should in all respectsbe placed  in the same position as  Dominions  officers, and when, therefore, that stagewas reached a decision would  have to be taken as  to the best means of meeting  thesituation.    That, however, does not arise now, but 1 draw your attention to it. in order to showwhy I  think  it undesirable that we should, at this stage,  go  beyond  some suchannouncement as  follows: &quot;We anticipate  that when that stage (i.e. the  stageadumbrated in the revised announcement referred to  above) has been reached, it maybe  necessary  to consider  the  question  of conferring upon fndians who  will becommissioned thereafter into  that army some type of commission such  as is held by officers of Dominions  forces in other parts of  Empire, but that that point would onlyarise if  and when our scheme had taken definite shape and  its success was assured.&quot;It would  be made clear that  for the  present  we were doing  no more than placeAssembly  in possession of our own immediate intentions in regard to the  IndianSandhurst Committee Report.    Para. 2  regarding Cranwell.  i agree that the portion of  my private and personal telegram No. 501 S. to which you refer may be made official.    Para. 3.  1 discussed  informally with  the Secretary of State for War, and  so didBirdwood, and he said he would  not  have any objection to the  postponement of  thechange in type of the commission.
