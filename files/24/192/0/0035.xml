MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    WITH reference to my memorandum of the 24th January last (CP. 22 (28))on the subject of the Franco-American Draft Pact of Perpetual Friendship and theAmerican draft of an Arbitration Treaty to replace the Anglo-American Arbitra-tion Treaty of 1908, I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum by  Sir Cecil Hurstreporting his  recent  private conversations  on these  matters  with  M. Fromageot,Legal Adviser to the  French Ministry  for Foreign Affairs.                                              AUSTEN  CHAMBERLAIN.    Foreign Office. February 7, 1928.                      MEMORANDUM BY SIR CECIL  HURST.    While I  was  in  Paris  I  had  prolonged  and  very  intimate  talks  withM. Fromageot  on the  negotiations between France and  the United States  withregard to the treaties for  the outlawry of war aud  the renewal of the arbitrationconvention, and on the corresponding draft treaty which the Americans have offered to His Majesty&apos;s  Government for the renewal oi&apos; the arbitration convention.    1.  The first  point we discussed was the difference  between the meaning of theterms &quot;war of aggression&quot; and &quot;recourse to war as an instrument of national policy.&quot;  I wrote a minute on one paper before I  went  to Paris, saying that, sofar as I could see, there was no real difference between the phrases and that I didnot quite understand why the French  had thought it necessary  to introduce the term  &quot;aggression&quot; merely because the treaty was to be multilateral instead of bilateral.    M. Fromageot told me that he agreed with me that  there was not in reality any difference between the two phrases, but he said that what had happened  was thatwhen  the French draft was made  public last June, in  which France agreed to renounce war,  the  Belgians and the Czechs  had  both  become excited  and had expressed alarm lest the French undertakings to come to their aid would lose their value.  It was this which  really lay beneath the introduction of the  phrase &quot;war of aggression.&quot;   Now  that the United  States had  raised objection  to the  latterphrase,  M. Fromageot was  at work  to  see  if  he  could find some  satisfactoiysubstitute.   He told me in confidence that he  was considering whether the phrase&quot; guerre engagee  malgre 1 &quot;attitude pacifique de la  partie adverse &quot; might not beemployed.  The idea of this phrase is taken from the treaty between Germany and russia concluded about two years ago.   It  expresses  the same idea as  &quot; war of aggression &quot; in different language.    2.  The next point that I  discussed with M. Fromageot was the reconciliationof the draft outlawry of war treaty with articles 16  and 17 of the  Covenant, whichoblige France as a member of the League of Nations to take measures which mayhave to be belligerent against a non-member State (which might in her case be theUnited States)  because that  non-member  State resorted to war with  a member ofthe League.  M.  Fromageot&apos;s view was that the words &quot;nationale et reciproque &quot;in the outlawry of war  treaty limited the operation of the treaty to war arising outof relations or disputes between the two parties to the treaty and, therefore, did not      4299  [17180]
 run counter to any measures, even of a warlike kind, which France was obliged to take by reason of her commitments in the Covenant of the League.     3.   The  third  point  we discussed was the apparent  inconsistency  between article 2 of the outlawry of war treaty, which requires all disputes to be solved by pacilic means, and the presence in the draft arbitration convention of reserves as to the cases to be arbitrated.     M.  Fromageot \s view is that under the outlawry of war treaty, article 2, if the conciliation proposals had  failed to result in recommendations which both parties were willing  to accept and which therefore ended the dispute, the dispute would drag on  unsettled; neither party could go to  war.   This is what happens under the Treaty of  Locarno, where France and Germany reciprocally undertake not  to resort to war even though the Council, acting under article 15, may not succeed in framing recommendations which both parties are willing  to accept.   Want of unanimity in the Council in that  case does not entitle France  and Germany to  go to war with each other, because that war is absolutely prohibited by the  wording of the Locarno Treaty.   Article 2  of the  outlawry of war treaty  is not  limited to arbitration proceedings; it covers all conciliation proceedings,and in these only recommendations can be made.     4.   The fourth  point was a  small one. namely, the omission from article 2 of the French counter-draft of the arbitration convention of  the words &quot; which it has not been  possible to adjust by diplomacy.&quot;     The reason is that these words are superfluous.   The  draft arbitration conven- tion provides for the dispute going first to the Bryan Commission, and in the Bryan treaty itself there is  a  provision excluding disputes which it  has been found possible to adjust by diplomacy. .     5.   The fifth point we  discussed was the addition in  the French counter-draft of the reference to articles 53 and 54 of The  Hague  Convention of 1907. as to  the method of  settling the  compromis or special agreement where the parties are unable to agree  upon it.  M.  Fromageot agreed that the intention  had been to avoid  the power of the  Senate to  reject a special agreement.   The United States have now made the same objection as they made in 1907.  To get over the difficulty the French Government are now submitting  to the United States Government a new  formula under which the question of the terms of the compromis would go  to the Court at The Hague for settlement, but the terms of the compromis. as drawn up by the Court at The Hague, would not be binding upon  either  party unless it were confirmed by the constitutional  authorities in each country.   This would result in  the Senate having the right to reject the terms of the special agreement as settled by the Court at The Hague.  It is much less likely that  the Senate would reject a special agree- ment which had been settled in this way than i f it had merely been settled by the State Department.     6.  The next point which M. Fromageot and I discussed was the French phrase for &quot; matters  solely within  the domestic jurisdiction of that Party.&quot;  This is one of the reserves proposed in  the draft arbitration  convention offered by the United States and accepted by the French.     M. Fromageot was disposed to agree with me  that the  clearer French phrase  for this was  that used in article 15 of the Covenant, &quot; question que le droit international laisse a la  competence  exclusive de cette Partie,&quot;  and that this was to be preferred to the French phrase used in the counter-draft of  the arbitration convention.     7.  I also had a long talk with M. Fromageot as to the way in which the reserve as to the Monroe Doctrine would work in practice.     I wrote a minute  on  this  point the other  day.   M. Fromageot  said that technically he agreed with me, but that it was no longer open to the Powers to object to a saving as to the Monroe Doctrine. All  the Powers,  including Great  Britain, had accepted a similar reserve in  1907 made by the United States when they signed and ratified the convention  for the pacific settlement of international disputes of that year.   Apart,  therefore, from the  uudesirability  of becoming involved  in a discussion with the United States as to what the Monroe Doctrine means, the handsof the Powers are tied  by their own action  in 1907. Here I think he is clearly right.January 30, 1928.C. J. B. H.
