IS  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GGVKENMENT.JEST.                                                      COPY NO    3 Q. 49(28)                                 CABINET.                                 TRADE OUTLOOK.                Memorandum by the President  of  the Board  of  Trade.           I circulate,  for  the  information  Of  my colleagues, a record      of  the meeting of  my Advisory Council  held  in February.           On the whole, earlier forecasts of reasonable  progress      appear to  be  justified.  A number of industries producing what one      may call consumers1  goods  continue to  be  satisfactory, and  food      industries report  better trade.    Progress  in rubber manufactures      and in chemicals is maintained.           Turning  to the industries which are  less satisfactory,  there      is  not much change.  Steel production  has been maintained at  a      fairly steady level, but orders  are uncertain.  There  has been a      great deal of talk about the  advantage which the.-1 steel trade  will      reap from  shortening of hours and raising of wages  in  Germany; but      it  must be remembered  that the bulk of the  very high imports  come      not from Germany but from France, Belgium and Luxemburg.  A con-      siderable  effort has been made to establish an export  selling      organisation  in the steel trade, but it is  difficult to get agree-      ment between  manufacturers on the coast and manufacturers inland.           The motor industry appears  to be  sagging, and  the falling off      in that industry is reflected in the slackening of  orders among      its auxiliary trades.   In non-ferrous  metals, prospects are      reported to  be fair and considerably better than would appear from      the immediate market conditions.  Both shipbuilding and engineering      report some  unwillingness to  place orders pending a settlement of      the demands for increased wages.  It is,  however,  to be noted      that the tonnage under construction in the  last quarter of  1927  is-1-
satisfactory, both in the volume of work under constructionhere and in the relation of that volume to the world totalconstruction.     The worst news is the insane decision of the spinnersof American cotton to determine their  vmge agreements andclaim a reduction of wages and an increase of hours.  It isdifficult to understand how anyone in  their senses can askfor an increase from 48 to 54 hours  /hen they are at present working 33, and .vhen thin section of the trade refuses toconsider any effective consolidation of mills so as to runfull time in a smaller number of mills.  It is particularly unfortunate that this mischievous move should have been modeat a time -when the Manchester Chamber  of Commerce hadorganised a comprehensive investigation of the whole positionof the cotton industry, from the purchase of rav cotton toultimate sales in foreign markets, and had secured as partiesto this inquiry some of the most competent men in all sectionRof the trade.  The action of the American, spinners came as acomplete surprise to the Joint Committee of the Chamber. it came, moreover, at a moment when the Joint Committee were trying to arrange for representatives  of the workers to be associated with their inquiry.

RAILWAY ROAD BILLS.     THE PRESIDENT observed that he had been a little surprisedat the report of one Committee that had appeared on the questionof these Bills, because, looking at the matter simply from the traders&apos; point of view, it seemed to be of the greatest Impor-tance to get railway rates lowered, if possible, and certainlyto prevent them going up.  Consequently, anything which enabled the railway companies to earn more money  ought to be looked upon as a safeguard in respect of the railway rates which tradershad to pay, provided always that reasonable guarantees wereforthcoming that if the railways lost money on ancillary under-takings, that loss would not be brought into account in claimingan increase in their rates.  It must be to the interest of therailway companies to use their ancillary services to help themcarry   more and noteless traffic on their lines, because over-head charges on their railway undertakings remained at a con-stant level.  Suppose the railway companies were refused thepower to act as road carriers, even on condition of not bringingany loss on their road traffic into aocount against the railway rates, and suppose they were refused this power largely on thedemand of the traders, what possible answer could the tradersmake if the railway companies continued to lose revenue and thenwent to the Rates Tribunal for an increase in rates, and said,&quot;if \.e had been allowed to carry some road traffic this losswould largely have been averted&quot;?  Was it not in the traders1interests that the railways should have the wherewithal to compete with other forms of transport, and that there should bea prospect of a reduction of their rates,      SIR ARTHUR 3ALF0UR said he was perfectly clear in his ownmind that, with safeguards, the railways ought to be allowed touse the roads, and he was a little surprised at the generalattack that had been made on the Bills.  He thought, however, thatthere v/as a fear amongst traders and the public that if road transport got too much into the hands of the railways the peopleoccupied in it would be drawn into railway trades unions, andthat if it at any time the country had to fight a great strikethey vrould be too dependent on those unions.  After all, the greatstrike, and all transport strikes during the last ten years, hadbeen beaten by road transport.     SIR STANLEY 1.ACHIN had always taken the attitude that notonly have the railways a reasonable right to run on the roads,but with proper safeguards It could be arranged to the benefit ofthe traders.  The railways had a revenue to earn and unless theywere allowed to adopt the most up-to-date means of earning thatrevenue, those goods which were compelled to go by rail, theheavy goods, steel and coal etc, must in time be called upon tomake up for loss of revenue which would be caused by the in-creasing road traffic which the railways were preventing from-1
undertaking.  A fear existed in the mind of traders, whoremembered what happened in connection with the canals, that something in the form of a monopoly might be assumed by therailway companies, which would be a very serious thing.  But,given proper security as to monopoly and as to tne adjustment of rates, Sir S. ^achin felt that it was fair, and in the longrun would be to the benefit of traders generally, that some arrangement should be made.     LORD GAIi*FORD explained that he was in rather a difficult position, because the Federation of British Industries had hada report from their Transport Committee which nad been putlish-ed, but the Committee&apos;s view had so far rot&apos;been ratified bythe Council of the Federation,  They were -meeting that, after-noon and the whole matter would be very carefully considered*His own feeling, as distinct from the vaews - not yetcollected - of the Federation of British Industries, was thatthere was a great deal cf substance in what the President had said, that if we could only add tD the resources of therailway companies, we should enable them not merely tc  pay anadequate return tc the investors, but also to reduce their rates and help industry.-  There was a great deal of sympathy with the railway companies in the fact that they were calledupon to pay as companies very larg- sums of money for local rates, while they were not allowed as companies to takeadvantage of a greet deal of their expenditure &quot;which went forthe repair and maintenance cf roads.  But, on the otlier hand,one had to look at tho railway companies from the point of viewof what they had recently been doing?  Taking an illustrationIn his own firm,- he mentioned that owing oo the action of therailway companies in imposing high railway rates more than to anything else, the output of their collieries in the County ofDurham, which were on the west side of Durham and some way from the seaboard, had been reduced from 60/COO tons a week to SO,000 tons a weeks  The railway companies had recently,In spite of everything that the traders had urged, increased their rates.  They had thereby forced a certain amount of theirtraffic on to the roads, and away from themselves, and theywere now trying to regain that traffic by seeking further powers from Parliament.   Lord Gainford&apos;s own view of thepolicy of the railway companies was that by reducing railway rates they would have given increased facilities to the public,they would have increased the volume of traffic, helped unem-ployment, diminished local rates, added enormously to theamount of production in this country, and stimulated exports.They had pursued exactly the opposite policy, and that policy they had justified on the ground that they could raise more money by raising rates for the benefit of their shareholders.In his judgment that had been disastrous for industry.
      There was  nothing in the Bills which the railway com- panles  were presenting to Parliament to prevent  them driving competitors off the roads by undercutting them for  a period. They  had resources  which would enable them to do it.  An enormous number of  traders,  as well as Individuals  connected with  motor transport traffic, had spent large sums  of money in developing road  transport.  If they were to be driven off the roads by competition from the railway companies, there was nothing to  safeguard the public against the  railway  com- panies  doing one of two things, either to make the  public pay more  for the use of the roads, or to drive them  on  to the railways where  the  companies oould still secure  a monopoly. It was  true the Companies said they had no intention of  doing either,  but under the powers of the Bills they might do  it, and therefore the public and the industries of the  country ought to be safeguarded.      The railway companies had approached the Federation of British Industries  through Sir Josiah Stamp,  and Lord Gainford hoped  that the outcome of their discussion that afternoon would be  that a Committee would be  appointed to try to  arrange  with the railway companies clauses to safe- guard the interests of the public   These might contain some safeguards such as  those  already secured in  the Bill passed through the Irish Free State Parliament, which prevented a railway  company from entering into competition with traffic already  working on  a road to the satisfaction of the general public    The question was determined by the  Minister who uas responsible to  Parliament.    The Railway  company only get in where, In the opinion of the Minister,  It could justify  a case  for  supplying a public need.    That  was perhaps  not  exactly practical In this country, but  they might proceed to discuss something on those lines with the railway  companies.      SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR  suggested that  certain other suggestions  drawn up on a previous occasion by the Association of  Chambers  of  Commerce,  in  consultation with  the railway companies,  in connection with a  proposal  for a general inquiry  Into  transport,  might be  considered by the Federation of  British  Industries.      TIE  PRESIDENT welcomed the  proposal  for a joint consider^ ation of  safeguards by the Federation of British Industries and the railway  companies.    On  the question of a general enquiry Into transport, he considered that, while there mightbe a good case for such an inquiry, it would be unfair toallow it to postpone a decision  on the very Important question of whether the railway companies should run on the roads.     MR. WARHAM observed that the Transport Committee of theMining Association were of opinion that the Bill of the rail-way companies ought to be opposed.   They felt it was thefirst duty of the railway companies to make their railwaysefficient j that the high costs and the high wages paid on.
the railways compared with those in the heavy industries of the  country was  one very important factor in thesituation, and to enable them tog-jontothc roads at thepresent  juncture was not going to help to get down railway rates.   The Mining Association felt that the railwaysought to be put to  the test in bringing their own businessInto the closest relation with the real competitive in-dustries of the country.   The Association also felt therewas a danger that all these transport workers, by going intothe National Union  of Railwayinen, might cause trouble later on.   They had, however, appointed a Committee to go Intothe matter very closely before coming to a final decision.     MR. AYXROYD believed the interests of the country wouldbe served if the railways were given power to go on the roads.He could not help feeling that people allowed prejudice to outweigh judgment in this matter.  There were millions of trustee  stock invested in railways, and it was to theinterest of the country as a whole to see that those rail-ways paid.   It would help to bring the rates down If therailways were allowed to run on the roads.  In his own dis-trict the mails in  the morning were not now brought into thecountry  by rail, but by a Ford van; the milk was all deliver-ed to the towns by  road, and they found in some of the remotedistricts in Yorkshire that they were beginning to use therailway  stations alternately.  All this capital was lyingidle and producing  nothing.   Hull, for instance, was a largeport for goods coming from New Zealand and Australia.   Kisown firm for six or seven years had brought nothing fromHull Into Bradford  on the railway; everything had been brought by road.   That had been because of the high railway charges.If these had been on a lower basis they would by all meanshave used the railways.   One public safeguard lay in thefact that If we had difficulty with the railway companiesbecause  they tried  to create a monopoly, it would be theeasiest  thing in the world for combinations of firms to runfleets of motors and break that monopoly.     The time had now come when we must as a whole set our-selves to assist the railways.   On the other hand, therailway  companies were lacking in enterprise.   The carriage of a sheep or a lamb cost as much as the animal itself.That was the sort of thing that agriculturists had  been suffer-ing;  they could not move stock because it  was doubled in price.   Accordingly, they were setting up their own meansof transport and the railways were losing  traffic they would never get back.     MR RICHMOND was, personally, of opinion that it wouldcertainly be to the advantage both of the railway companies and the community that the former should have power to operate on the roads, but it would be very Important tomake some provision as regards conditions of employment,  soas to prevent the possibility of a stoppage In an emergency.That ought to be safeguarded as It r/os&quot;with regard toattendance in electricity stations.
     SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT considered that the motor manufacturarswould support the Bills provided there were guarantees that therailway companies would not seek eventually to make all themotors themselves, not only for their own use but, as had happened in the case of one of the transport organisationsin London, for other users as well.  There appeared to be nofoundation for the fear that, in the event of a big strike onthe railways, the effect of the companies having road service as well would make the position worse than It was in the laststrike.  The vehicles which ran during the strike were driven bynon-unionists.   Vvhether it were the railway companies, orwhether it were other employers, who had got  union drivers onthe road, those men would not continue working, and the country would have to depend on non-union drivers and on volunteers.     It was thought that the railway companies should be given  an opportunity of closing dovm a number of their branch lines indistricts which could be much better served by road, and some oftheir light railways which we knew they ran at a loss.  Thepeople who might perhaps feel a grievance were transportationcompanies rather than the ordinary users of roads, - transporta-tion companies running, for instance, between London toSouthampton and competing for passengers vith the railways.Those were the people likely to be hit and not the legitimatetransport interests.     SIR E. PETTER explained that he spoke for himself, as thematter had not yet been debated by the Council of the BritishEngineers&apos; Association.   In his opinion it was vital to the  ^manufacturers of this country that the railways should pay, quarailways.  There was a danger, if the railways were going onto the roads, that they might seek the prosperity of theircompanies from the road3 to the detriment of the railways.Every manufacturer situated at any distance from the coast wasvery seriously prejudiced vis-a-vis continental competitorsbecause of the railv/ay rales charged for conveying his goods tothe ports.  He considered that the railway companies ought tomake their business pay as railways without help from any road transport service.  It was quite conceivable the railways might make a lot of money for their shareholders if they went intothe multiple provision business or the artificial silk industry,but we wanted an efficient and cheap railway transport system,especially for long distance traffic.  He, personally, viewedwith some apprehension the diversion of railway managers&apos;energies and efforts from making their railway systemsefficient to getting their profits out of the roads.     MR, LEE observed that this matter came up for discussion at a meeting of the Board of  the Manchester Chamber of Commercethe previous week, when it was decided that the Bills should be approved, but with a certain  number of precautions.   There
was one point which was not put into the minutes but which ranvery much through the whole discvission, and this was that if the bills were passed, or indeed if they were not passed, it would bevery desirable to have some general enquiry on road transport inthe country.  It was felt that too much of the heavy transport ofthe country was being diverted to the roads, that the roads weregradually being made impassable, and that an enquiry should bemade Into the whole question, quite apart from the railway  roadbills.     MR. VYLE felt that it was very difficult to get at anycombined or concentrated opinion upon this matter.  It was highly controversial, and it had been debated by the Association ofChambers of Commerce, with considerable emphasis on both sides.Generally speaking, he thought that the view held was that as amatter of equity the railway companies should be allowed to take up road transport, but that they must by reason of theirmonopolistic character svibmit to certain restraints.  It was not clear, however, what real help this was going to be to thegeneral user of transport, and that was why a strong opinion hadbeen expressed that the question of co-ordinating all systems oftransport, including roads, rail, canals, and coast-wise traffic,should come under review, so that out of it all we could get amore efficient system of transport than we had at the presenttime.  From the point of view of general efficiency, it seemedwrong to leave the railways in a semi-idle state and to do seme-thing which would add still further to the, great congesticn onthe highways.  If the railway companies would apply their mindsto finding out how they could use their existing resources forthe public benefit at much cheaper rates, and make it well worthwhile for traders to send their sttiff by rail, they would achieve the end they really had in view.  Personally, Mr. Vyle could not see that they were going to improve their earnings by entering into the fierce competition that they would have to face with theroad transport as already set up.     MR. HILL remarked that the chemical trade had had to cope with special regulations for the carriage of their goods by railway companies, and with a very restrictive classificationand high rates.  Road transport had been the only solution tothat problem, and naturally the chemical trade viewed ruthdisfavour any extension of railway companies&apos; powers unless thatwould mean a diminution of restrictions or a diminution of rates.The Council of the Association of British Chemical ManufacturerBwas meeting the next week to consider this matter, and theywould have the benefit of the views of some representatives ofthe railway companies, members of the Council, at that meeting.
COAL.     MR.  57ARHAM stated  that the  output  of  coal  in the UnitedKingdom for the last  two  weeks in  December and  the first week in  January  had  been considerably lower  than for the same periodof  1925/26,  being  over  three quarters of a million tons less.For the week ending January 14th,  however,  tne  output had been5,279,000 tons,  being 100.8 per  cent of the March 1925 weeklyaverage basis,  but lower  than the  corresponding period in 1926when the  output was 5,460,800 tons.  The number of personsemployed  in the industry  for the week ending the 14th Januarywas 85.9  per cent  calculated on  the same basis.   Unemploymentfor the month of December showed some improvement,  being 17.3 per cent  as against 18.5  per cent  in November.     The  quantity  of  coal exported from this  country inDecember  was 3,886,405  tons as compared with  4,126,745 tons inNovember; the value was  3,124,874 or 16s.Id  average price perton f.o.b.,  being  a fall  in value  of sixpence per ton comparedwith the  previous  month.   The exports from the United kingdom to  Scandinavia  showed a further  fall, being 377,000 tons asagainst 468,000  tons  in November;  Italy and Spain also showedconsiderable falls compared with November  - Italy 450,000 tons as  against  562,000 tons;  Spain 139,000  tons as against 230,000tons.   On the other hand,  exports  to Germany  had  increased from385,000 tons to  445,000 tons in  December;  to  Belgium and holland from 326,000  to 345,000  tens, and  to  France from713,000 to  761,000 cons.   The total exports from  the UnitedKingdom for  the  last  year had been 51,149,193 tons as comparedwith 73,400,118  tons  in 1913 and 50,817,118 tons  in 1925,  aslight  increase  on 1925,  but 22,  millions  down as compared with1913.     The  average pit  head price  per ton of  commerciallydisposable  coal  in the  United Kingdom fell  during the year 1927from 18/7.90  in  January to 14/0.11 in October.  The output ofcoal in Germany, France,  Saar and Belgium was slightly lessthan in October, but  Poland showed a slight increase.     The  coal trade   seemed always to be in some  politicalturmoil nowadays,  and in  addition to import restrictions invarious countries,  it was  now faced with an arrangement between italy and Germany  by which Italy proposed to  take, in coal,  allreparations due to her  in  kind from Germany.  The reason givenfor this was that  the Italian Government were not desirous of importing, on account of  reparation,  goods which might oompetewith other Italian products,  and  had decided, therefore,  to import  coal  instead.   It  was understood  that an arrangement hadbeen come to between the  Banca Commercials  Italians, theItalian Government, the German Government and the German CoalSyndicate, and that a Company had been formed called theAsienda Nazionale Consumatcri Carbone S.A.  to dispose of thiscoal in Italy.  This Company had  also been appointed agent forthe German Tfestphalian  Coal  Syndicate,  except for the sale of coke and anthracite.   The  Mining Association were informedthat contracts had been made  for the transportation of the coalin question - five million  tons  for 1928 and six million tons
COAL (CONTD.) .for 1929.  This constituted a very grave menace to the british coal trade, and he inquired if it were not possible for somediplomatic action to be taken.     The other difficulty was the restriction upon the import of coal into Germany, owing to the German system of licences.In 1913 we had exported nine million tons of coal to Germany;in 1927 we exported less then four and a quarter million tons.     THE PRESIDENT, replying on the question of the Italianarrangement, said that the highest legal advice had been taken at the earliest opportunity, bat there was, he was sorry tosay, no case whatever that could be made either under theTreaty or under the London Agreement.  It was entirely withinthe competence of the two parties to do what had been done.Therefore we could not give cur delegate on the reparations commission instructions to opooso an arrangement which any international Court would at once declare to be valid.  He had discussed the matter with the Foreign Secretary, who had agreedthat if he saw any opportunity of bringing the desired pressure to bear on Italy in some other way, he would do so.     With regard to German import licences for coal,  thePresident explained the position under the Anglo-German Treaty,and suggested that the Mining Association had better discuss thematter with Commodore King,  if there was any instance oflicenses being refused.     LORD GAINFORD reported that the demand for coke inCleveland and even on the 7/est Coast was somewhat tetter,  and consumers were more inclined to purchase for forward delivery.In regard to coal, the price for unscreened in the middle  ofthe month had hardened to 14/-, but had dropped slightly since then.  There was no change in the price of manufacturing coal,and household coal was still in fair request.IRON AND STEEL.     LORD GAINFORD stated that British steel works throughoutthe country were really short of work.  The majority were working on short time and buyers still appeared to be holdingoff.  The German steel makers had increased their price for steel sections by 3/- and 5/6d per ton for Basic Bessemer and open-Hearth steel respectively, hut there was still a difference of 35/- between the German price and our own,  andtherefore it was unlikely that this alteration would interferewith the consumption of foreign steel in this country.   He had had some statistics recently taken out about the cost of labour in the iron and steel trade in Germany and in this country.The average cost of skilled and unskilled labour in the iron andsteel trade in this country was 6l/- per week per man employed.In Germany the skilled men averaged 45/- and the unskilled3l/9d.  Belgium was more or less the same as France, and france was about fifty per cent lower than ours.  When the longerworking hours in those countries were also taken into account.
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).it showed how much we were handicapped in regard to  the costof labour in the production  of our steel.   In the productionof the raw materials there was no doubt a similar variation.      Imported iron and steel, during the month of December,amounted to 281,000 tons oompared with a monthly average for1927  of 370,000 tons.  An analysis of the December figuresshowed 5,000 tons of basic pig iron mainly  from France, 10,800tons  of foundry iron from Belgium and other countries, and5i,600 tons of semi-finished steel.  The exports of pig ironduring December amounted to 38,116 tons compared with a monthly average, during 1327, of 19,639 tons, so that our exports of pig iron had been going up and our imports had been going down.  Those figures were satisfactory so far as theywent.      MR BOND wrote  -  &quot;The  production  of  pig iron  in Decemberamounted  to  559,100 tons compared with 575,900 tons inNovember.  The  December production  brings  the total output forthe year  up  to  7,293,600 tons;  this compares with 2,458,200tons  in 1926, when  production was curtailed on account of thecoal  stoppage,  and  6,261,700 tons in  1925.   Steel productionin December  amounted  to 604,900 tons, the decline of 93,800tons  compared with  November being largely due to  the Christmasholidays.  The  total  output of  steel  amounted to  9,098,900tons  for  the year.  Steel  production  thus slightly exceeded(by 31,600 tons) the  output of  1920,  which  was the previouspost-war  highest.    &quot;At first sight the figures compare  favourably with thoseof recent years; it is only when the  figures are  looked at inmore  detail  that the  reason for the dissatisfaction with thepresent position is seen.  It will  then  be  seen that theproduction of pig iron reached  its  maximum  in May at 720,100tons, since  when production has been  continuously decliningto the  559,100 tons of December, and  that steel productionreached its  maximum as long ago as  tiarch when 943,600 tons were  produced.  Further, although the rate  of importation of continental  material  steadily declined throughout the year andthe December figure of 2SC,500  tons was the  lowest for theyear, yet this figure is 44,300 tons higher  than the average rate  of importation in the first three months of 1926,  and nearly 100,000 tons in excess of the average monthly import in1913.  The imports for the whole year amounted to 4,406,100tons  and were the largest  ever  recorded,  exceeding even those for 1926,  the year of the  coal  stoppage,  by nearly 700,000tons.  For the first time  in a  year when there was no dislocation-tion  of home production on account  of a strike,  importsexceeded exports, and this by the substantial total of over200,000 tons, even though  exports (4,199,700 tons for the year)were higher than in any post-war year, except 1923 when theywere  stimulated by the Ruhr occupation.   Prices steadilydeclined throughout the year,  the Board of Trade index numberfor iron and steel being 127.8  in January and 113.6 inDecember (1913*100).
                                0 0 9IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).    &quot;In spite of the optimistic  tone which is adopted in some quarters with regard to the outlook for 1928, it is very-doubtful if the January production of pig iron will exceedthat of December, and, although  steel production ought to bein excess of the December production, since the Decemberoutput was interfered with by the Christmas holidays, it is unlikely that the January output will exceed that of october and November.  In many districts a hopeful tone is said toprevail, but it is admitted that the actual volume of businessplaced is not large and that work is still rather of a hand tomouth character,  and works are everywhere v/orking at very much below capacity.  Makers act up to their belief that some improvement is imminent, by keeping prices firm, and on theNorth coast there is some talk of a slight increase in pig ironprices.  On the other hand business in East coast hematite issaid to be unprofitable.  Reports from Scotland, lancashire and South Wales definitely state that there is no improvement.     &quot;German prices have risen as a result of the arbitrators&apos;award in the wages and hours dispute, but an analysis of theimports into the United Kingdom in 1927 shows that only about10 per cent, of the imports came from Germany,  and althoughit is believed that this an voider-statement,  it is true thatit is not German prices, but Belgian and French, which affectthis market.&quot;     MR. HIGH wrote :-         ; j .&apos;                  &apos;i       )      j     &quot;The returns of trade for the past year are now available and show a steel production of 9,098,900 tons.  This was onlyexceeded during the last two years of the war, when the outputreached 5,716,544 tons in 1917, and in 1918 &apos;  - 3,539,439 tons.It amounts, moreover, to over 1,435,000 tons in excess of thehighest pre-war output of 1913 when the production was 7,663,876tons.  It is interesting to note,  however,  that the 1913 out-put represented 10.2 . of world production whereas that of lastyear was only 9.l  of world production.   The year&apos;s production was swollen in the first half of the year by the working off ofarrears that had accumulated during the mining dispute, andwhereas in the six months ending June the production was,989,100 tons, it dropped to 4,109,800 tons in the six month sending December.     &quot;There was a substantial increase in exports of iron andsteel in 1927 as compared with the last normal year, 1925,  thefigures being:-      1925... 3,731,096 tons.   1927... 4,199,735 tons.     On the other hand there v/as a much more substantial increase in imports,  the figures being:-      1925... 2,719,715 tons.   1927... 4,406,125 tons.     The year ended with an unemployment figure of 14.1). inthe pig-iron trade, and 22.7&apos;,- in the heavy  steel trade.
IRON AND STSSL (CONTD.).      &quot;As  regards  tne  present  trade  prospects,  the view of the Iron  and  Steel  Trades Confederation  is  that,  so far as concerns the heavy steel trade,  the production  for  the  second  half of 1927  may  be  taken as  a  measure  of a fairly stable demand  for the current  year.   There  is nothing in the present outlook which appears to  carry  the promise  of  a larger volume of trade,  neither  is there anything to suggest  a  setback.  A similar rate of output  would  give this year  a  production  of over  eight million tons of steel.   This would  be  on improve- ment  on recent  years, but  it  is not enough spread over a productive capacity of  from 12  million to  13 million  tons. It would leave  the industry with an unemployment  percentage  of from  20 to 25,  with furnaces  and mills working intermittently and with  a considerable quantity of plants entirely out of operation.   That  there  is  now a larger demand  for steel products  than before  the V/ar  is undoubted.   On the most conservative estimate world production has increased  in the last  fourteen years by  over 20  million tons, yet  Great Britain&apos;s  relative  production is less  than in  1913.   TheUnited  States of  America has  greatly increased her internal trade,  partly at  the  expense  of her exports; Germany,  since the Continental Steel Cartel  was agreed upon,  had done  the same.   Both  these  countries have sacrificed  some  of that portion of their  trade  in  which prices were  forced down to aminimum of profit,  and  both have concentrated  on  the  more pro fit- able  home  market in  which - the  one by tariffs and  the other by the  terms of the Cartel   they  are  more  protected from external competition.      &quot;The  tinplate  industry has  recently made  considerablerecovery after a bad time  extending over most  of  the year.   InMarch last it had  only  5 .&apos;  of  unemployment.   From  that date thefigure  rose week by week until  in  September only  two-thirds of the  operatives were  employed.  In November  an  agreement wascome  to affecting  over  90^ of the trade.   Prices  were stabilisedand output restricted.  Prices have since  improved and condi-tions generally are better than  they have  been  for some time.The latest figures  published  of  galvanised sheet  productionshowed a falling off in October, as compered with  September,  of6,000 tons.  January reports  are that  the  trade shows no sign of Improvement and that business is slow.  The  exports ofgalvanised sheets were:- October, 1927,  66,700  tons; November,1927,  65,277 tons and  December,   1327, 52,069 tons.      Generally speaking, there appears  to be a more healthytone with regard to the prospects of the iron and steel tradesthan has existed for the past  5 years.&quot;SPSEL.     SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR considered that, in general, thespecial steel trades, the high class steels, were not in asatisfactory condition.  Motor car steel, which now bulkedvery largely in tho Sheffield trades, was not at all favourablyplaced.  As far as could be judged in Sheffield, there was not
STEEL (CONTD. ) . as  large  a purchase  of  motor cars  in  thi3  country now  as  there had been  last  year.   The  heavy steel  trade was  also  in a  poor way;  the  mills and forges in Sheffield were working  three, four and  five  days a week instead  of  six.      As regards the  export trade,  that with the United States was dying rapidly, that with Canada and  New Zealand  was      s uniformly good.   Australian business  was in a very upset  condi- tion,  owing to constant alterations of the tariff.   In Japan the. financial  situation was still  very difficult.  We  were  doing very little trade, and  only just managing  to hold on.   In China v/e  were  still  doing a fair trade;  they were still buying and still paying.  The  really bright  spot  was -South  America whejre our traders were  getting a  really good foothold in competition with  Germany  and other countries, and this was really saving  the situation.   European conditions were not good.  Generally  speaking,  in the  special  steel and  speoial tools trades,  our prices  in France were  about 60$&quot;- too  high, owing to  the tariff  and the exchange, and  we really  could not compete there  at all.      THE  PRESIDENT remarked that this country had got  the most. she   could from the French by negotiation, but  could not, of course, prevent an increase of duties, including  a considerable inorease  on machinery,  which might, however, be adjusted  under most-favoured-nation  treatment  as  the result of French negotia- tions  with  Switzerland.   But a  despatch  had  been  sent  to  the French Government based not on  the detailed  negotiations  which had taken place, but on the Economic Conference at Geneva.  We had said  to them, &quot;You  took an  active part  in the Conference, and you were parties  to the conclusion that  the time had  come for beginning  a general reduction  of tariffs.   Here are the first  fruits,  - a tariff  of yourrs which provides  for  a large increase  in many respects.   Where  do you stand?    There are a good many people in this  country whose attitude is going  to be determined  by whether other countries do or  do  not follow a lead which  we have consistently given, and a lead which we -took at  Geneva.   Does Geneva mean anything or does it  not?&quot;  One could  not say what the  effect  of the despatch would be.      SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR was  certain that that was  a good move.With  regard  to Spain, the  Council  knew that  endeavours were being  made  officially to  form internal rings in the steel trade in Spain,  and if these  endeavours  were successful  our  traderswould  be  put out of business  there completely.   It was doubtful,however,  whether they would  be  successful.
OOKPIDaillAL.STBjSL (CONTD.)     The home trade in special steels was good.  There were many more orders last January than in January 1927, inspite of the delayed orders in 1927 following the coal strike.  There was a great deal of hope in the trade inSheffield, perhaps even more hope than orders, but aconsiderable trade was being done.     Foreign steel manufacturers - Austrian and Czecho-Slovakian - who had had works in Sheffield before the war,were now coming back there egain.  They found that under their conditions, which were easier than ours in regard to cost of social services, they could manufacture steelabroad and bring it to Sheffield.  They formed Englishcompanies, of course, and worked in Sheffield from aSheffield address, and did an export trade from therebetter than they could from their own country.NON-FERROUS METALS.      SIR CECIL BUDD wrote :-         &quot;During January conditions in the metal markets have been quiet, and disappointing possibly to those who had pitched their expectations too high, but I do not feel it necessary to modify the views which I have expressed at the last two meetings of the Council to the effect that there is more work on hand and in prospect than has been the case for some time past.  The work is unfortunately unevenly distributed, and not in all cases, I fear, profitable, but I still feel that a restrained optimism is justified.         &quot;A development worth mentioning is the acquisition by Imperial Chemical Industries Limited of the share capital of Elliotts Metal Company and the British Oopper^ Manufacturers, which were amalgamations of large copper andvbrass manufacturing concerns;  and these, in addition to the works already controlled by the Imperial Chemical Industries, represent a fusion of a very important proportion of the copper and brass industries of the country.  I understand that further acquisitions are the subject of present negotiation, and I regard this development as having the possibility of substantial advantage to the maintenance of these trades in this country&quot;.ENGINEERING.     MR. RICHMOND observed that it had been agreed thathie report to the Council  should cover marine engineeringthroughout the United Kingdom, together with general
engineering in Scotland;  he would, therefore,  divide hi3report Into two parts.  As to marine engineering, there hadbeen a distinct lull in &quot;business since the beginning of theyear, very few contracts had been placed and none of these had been of any great importance.  The distribution of the destroyer programme by the Admiralty had been anxiouslyawaited and would probably be known within the next day ortwo.  That would certainly provide a fair amount of workto take tho place of that which was rapidly nearing completion.  Possibly one of the factors that had delayedthe placing of new work was the wages question, both in theengineering shops and in the shipyards,  The engineeringwages agreement, dating from 1st August last, gave a rise of2/- a week to plain tine workers,  and that agreement had justexpired.  The engineering unions had now decided to apply for an advance of 8/- to plain time workers and an equivalent advance to piece workers.  A Joint conference would take place shortly when this matter would be negotiations-ted.  On the shipyards&apos; side the unions were advancing a claim for lo/- a week increase, and until both those questions were got out of the way  there would be a oertainhesitation in placing new contracts.  The outlook on thewhole was not very promising at the moment,     V/ith regard to general engineering in Scotland, the machine tool trade reported a much better tone and somequite good orders.  In  steel constructional work a largeorder had been received for the steel towers for the transmission lines for the Central Scottish ElectricityScheme.  A fair number of new orders were being placed for railway equipment and new locomotives;  and, as the council were aware, twenty-nine locomotives for South Africa hadbeen ordered from the North British Locomotive Company.Further, the tender of a Glasgow firm had been accepted forerecting a sugar refinery in Portuguese East Africa at a cost of about  300,000,  There was altogether a betterfeeling throughout the Scottish general engineering Industryand if the wages question were once settled for a period there were distinct evidences of .a gradxial improvement.     SIR 3. FETTER  thought that, with regard to general engineering in England, they had not quite done all they had hoped to do last month.  The exports for December fell to42,847 tons, as compared with 58,243 tons for November,although the average value per ton rose from  93.4 to  97,7.As a result of the  drop In the December figures, the 1927exports did not quite equal those of 1925.  Imports ofmachinery  in December were 7,887 tons as compared with8,954 tons in November, but the average values shewed aconsiderable increase and went up from  151.8 to  172. per ton,  A detailed analysis of the exports and imports of.raachinery during each of the last three years shewedthat exports of electrical machinery had steadilyincreased during the period, while those of boilers,ENGIKEERING (OCNTD .)
ENGINEERING (CONTO. )boiler-house plant and machine tools had remained relativelysteady.  Agricultural machinery had fallen back.  Textilemachinery, which had fallen heavily in 1926, had made a goodrecovery, but was not yet up to the 1925 level.  The index of unemployment for the engineering industry for Decembershowed a slight decline, and now stood at 9 per cent, ofInsured workpeople as against 9.4 for November,  As regards theimmediate prospect, it appeared that new business was not very good.  There was something almost approaching a slump inAustralia at the present time.  From all quarters one heardof a very considerable drop in orders for engineering material and machinery for Australia.MOTOR CAR INDUSTRY.     SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT said that enquiries during the last few days seemed to indicate that the industry generally wasin a very unsatisfactory condition.  We all saw the balancesheets of a few companies which were leaking profits, but Ina general way there were only two or three motor firms in thecountry which were producing cars in adequate numbers and doing any good.  It was believed that the holders of Britishcars in stock throughout the country were more congested thanthey had been at any previous period of the industry;  and,in addition to those stocks of British manufacture, an investigation made recently at the London Docks had revealedthat there were about 9,000 complete American cars in bondthere.  That was exclusive of the parts of cars which v/ereIn the hands of American assemblers.     At the last meeting of the Council Sir J.Thornycroft had sent in a note in which the export business v/as referred toas unsatisfactory.  Big stocks of British cars v/ere being held abroad unsold and, naturally, that had prevented manu-facturers from exporting more.  The statisticians of theindustry had calculated that if we had last year manufactured in this country all the cars which we imported, and if we hadmanufactured half the cars imported Into Australia, NewZealand and South Africa, It would have meant employment for110,000 more men during the year.  Sir John thought thesefigures indicated the importance of the industry.  His notesfor the last meeting had also touched upon the proposals whichthe manufacturers v/ere making and the way in which they suggested that the Industry could be helped.  The manufacturersv/ere asking for an interview with the President of the Boardof Trade, and it was hoped that those proposals would meetv/ith sympathetic attention.
COTTOI!.     MR. LEE considered that, looking at the textile trade of lancashire very largely from the view of the producers,there was practically no difference between the positionto-day and the position that existed when the Council metlast month.  The fine trade was still fully occupied;  thedemand was not perhaps quito as rood as it had boon a month ago, but that probably arose very It rgoly fx^om the weakeningin the price of the raw material, which made buyers morecareful about placing orders.  Taking it all round, however,the outlook In the fine trade was not bad, the machinery was fully employed, and there seemed to be a fair prospect ofthe continuance of that employment.  There 7/ere no groatprofits in that trade; well managed firms no doubt were making a profit, and firms not so well managed were probablyonly making their expenses, but still the position didnot cause one an:,&apos; very great anxiety.  The position, however,in the bulk trade, the coarse trade, was still just aboutwhore it had been.  It was running something like - at anestimate - sixty per cent.;  and of course both in spinningand in weaving, in the great majority of cases, it was stillrunning at a loss.     Hot much progress had been made with the enquiry whichhad been referred to at  the Council last month.  A meeting between the employers and tho operatives1 representatives had taken place shortly after, and it was then decided thata smaller Corur-ittee should meet at a later date.  If thingswent well it would probably require a very considerablenumber of those meetings before any decision was arrived at.The question had been taken by the Press to be very largely a demand on the part of the employers for an increase of hours of the employes  and a reduction  in their rates of pay.That was hardly fair.  The employers had put forward a numberof points which, they thought, affected the trade.  that number of points certainly inclxxced the two above mentioned,but they had all been put forward with the desire to have a discussion with the workpeople upon them.     SIR KENKSTE STE7/ART stated that, from the distributor^point of view, the state of the cotton piece roods market inJanuary had been, in general, much the same as in December,there being no marked change for the better or the worse.The bleachers had reduced their prices of certain types ofgoods which met the most serious Japanese competition, andthis was a very good move.  A drop of about 10%&apos;in the priceof American cotton had caused a good deal of hesitationtowards the latter end of the month, and orders were beingpostponed in order to see how far tho drop would go.  Foertrade in cotton piece goods all over the world appeared tc bothe chief reason of this fall.  Lancashire was not by any means the only place that was suffering.
CONFIDENTIAL.COTTON.  (CONTD.).     In India the Harwari Chamber of Commerce in Calcuttahad put a ban on plain staples for delivery during March,April and May, and orders for those months were likely tobe few and far between.   Other Indian markets, however,showed some Inclination to do business, but this did not make the prospects in India during the next month or twoany too good.   China was idle during January owing to the china New Year festivities;  the position now appeared tobe improving, however.   Java, which had been rather slackowing to an overstocked market, was giving hope of improve-ment.   Most other markets outside the East were quite nor-mal, and the home trade market was fairly busy.     Sir K. Stewart had a few general figures on the cotton trade in 1927.  The world exports of cotton piece goodsamounted to an average of about 770,000 metric tons In1909-1913, as compared with about 776,000 in 1927.   Inthe pre-war years 1909-1913 Great Britain had exported537,000 tons or 70  of the total, and in 1927, 354,000tons, or 45.7ft of the total.   All other countries improvedtheir proportion as compared to Great Britain, but notvery seriously except Japan, which improved from an averageof 10,000 tons odd in pre-war times to 120,000 tons in 1927,and Czecho-Slovakia  which increased from something verysmall to 41,000 tons.WOOL.     MR. AYKROYD mentioned that since the January meetingnothing had happened to  indicate any alteration in theposition of trade in the West Riding.   The number of combsrunning was about 6S to  67 per cent., which number shouldand would no doubt improve during the next few weeks, be-cause the raw material was beginning to come to hand prettyfreely and the combs had been standing during December and early January largely for lack of raw material.   In the spinning section there &quot;was no change.   About 86 per cent.of the spindles were running, and the tone&apos;in this sectionof business was much more cheerful.   In the single yarntrade particulars had been withheld from Germany which had caused a slight reduction in the amount of machineryrunning.   This movement was regarded in the trade asnothing more or less than a move on the part of the germans to do their utmost to control prices and bring them down.It was no indication as to the true state of business.     Manufacturers had very little to report.   The dresstrade was still bad.   55 per cent of the looms v/ererunning, 5 per cent were on short time and 40 per centstanding.   That v/as in the Bradford area, but in theRuddersfield area things were very much better.   in thelatter district the weavers of fine worsteds - a  high classtrade for men&apos;s wear -  were very busy and were late indelivery.   For tills class of work there was a greatshortage of weavers, and if more weavers were forthcoming
WOOL  (CONTD.)there would he more machinery running.   The spinnersin fancy yarns were also behind time in delivery.  Thiswas purely a speciality trade, which had been very de-pressed but had gradually come round to a state of prosperity.   The manufacturers of medium quality goods were variously employed, largely according to how theyhad speculated in raw material.   The medium and lowerwoollen goods were finding competition from the Continentvery keen, the makers of lower class woollen goods being very slack.  In the Batley and Dewsbury district thepiece trade showed no change, but there was a slightlybetter demand for blankets for immediate delivery.  Thelower class spinning in this district for carpet yarnswas fairly busy.   They had ?iork in hand for a few month.9.     Summing up the whoio position of the West Riding,Mr. Aykroyd thought the Improvement which began towardsthe end of last year had been maintained.   On the otherhand there war. r. tendency *.o make believe that things were better than :hey really were.   He had noticed inthe paper that, morning a heading to the effect that therewac a prospect of a boom in the trade of the country.That s^jrt of thing would do a lot of harm.   The wholeof the trades were struggling hard, and he believed theposition was slowly improving, but we were a long way from a boom.   One thing had helped the textile tradeand that was they had been rather fortunate in the pur-chase of raw material.   If raw materials were boughtjust at the crucial time it helped to run the machinery.ARTIFICIAL SILK.     MR. ADDISON wrote:-     &quot;The month of January Is usually marked by a falling off In buying which naturally follows stocktaking andthe close of the year.   Allowing for this feature, thepast month may be considered quite satisfactory, and a healthy demand is coming from the weaving centres inLancashire and Yorkshire.   The Leicester knitting tradeis busy and, as stocks are reported to be low, a goodSpring trade may reasonably be expecteda   The Leek,Macclesfleld, and Congleton areas are quiet.   TheNottingham lace trade is perhaps a little easier.  Fromthe knitters there is an increasing demand for yarn.    &quot;The export trade presents no new features, and, Inthe overseas markets, except where specialities are con-cerned, foreign competition is keen::.
                         CHEklCALS.   ilR. HILL handed in the following statement on the positionof the industry:-          &quot;The past few weeks have evidenced a promising     position in chemical industry; and, considering the de-     pression in a number of important chemical-consuming     industries, business in chemicals generally has been on a     more extensive scale than could reasonably have been     expected.  The fine chemical markets nave been disturbed     by end of the year activities, but more recently the de-     mand has been better than for some months.  Heavy chemicals     have been less affected by such disturbances, and,     especially on the export side, trade has progressed     favourably.  Judging by the general tone of reports on     Continental markets, it would appear that conditions in the     chemical markets are more favourable in this country than     elsewhere.  It must not be concluded from these remarks     that the present position is perfectly satisfactory.  A     factor which is more important in the chemical industry     perhaps than any other is that actual production must     approaoh very closely to maximum production-capacity, in     order to achieve efficient and economic working.  This has     not been fulfilled in a number of sections of the industry,     and when the ratio (of production to capacity) is small,     as for instance in such a manufacture as that of mineral     acids, the position is serious.&quot;     He desired to add that the Chemical Ltanufacturers nowregarded representation at the British Industries Fair as almostpart of their routine work, and they were now completing their arrangements.  This year the chemical section v/ould occupy 100 more space than In 1927, and they were doing propaganda work,supplementing the work of the Department of Overseas Trade inthat connection.  An interesting innovation had been made atthis year&apos;s Fair by the introduction of a chemical plantmanufacturers&apos; display as a sub-section to the chemical exhibit.It was fitting that this sub-section, which was being organised by the British Chemical Plant manufacturers&apos; Association,should be housed In the Chemical Hall, as emphasising the close co-operation which existed in the two industries, in addition toindicating the more obvious connection between them.                         RUBBER.     mR. JOHNSTON wrote:-     &quot;Generally speaking, conditions in the Rubber industrycontinue to be fairly satisfactory.  In the tyre branch thedemand is slack due to the usual seasonal falling-off in trade.The demand from manufacturers for initial equipment is also
RU3BER (COIiTD).rather slow owing to a certain amount of dulness in the market for cars at the moment.  There is no reason, however,  to suppose that the demand for tyres for replacement purposes willnot develop satisfactorily as the season advances.  Two of the factories under construction by foreign tyre manufacturers will shortly be in production and it Is likely that competition willbe accentuated, due to the efforts of the new factories tosecure a larger share of the trade in the British market,     &quot;The rubber footwear branch has been particularly activeowing to the unusually severe weather conditions.  Stocks of winter footwear have been satisfactorily cleared, and factories are still making full production for immediate consumption.Foreign competition, whilst strong, has been normal and reasonable, and there has been no tendency  to undue pricecutting.  It is expected that the demand for spring and summerrubber footwear will open out satisfactorily in due course.In the general rubber goods tirade the demand, as is usuallythe case towards the stocktaking period, has been rather poor,but indications are that business is now opening outsatisfactorily.  Judging by the demands for engineering rubbergoods the general trade outlook is improving.     &quot;The demand for goods for export, as far as the Dominionsand  astern markets are concerned, is quite satisfactory,although prices are keenc  Exports to Continental markets alsoappear to be more satisfactory than has been the case for sometime, and it appears now possible to export with a certainsmall margin of profit - a condition that has been entirelyabsent for several years past.  Employment  In the industrycontinues to improve and factories are working overtime incertain departments,&quot;FOOD INDUSTRIES.     SIR STANLEY LACElN reported a distinct improvement in the tone of trade generally, and especially in connection with thefood industries,  January had shown a slight Improvement uponlast year, and some of the big distributors in England had told him that their prospects were better, there was more confidence,and there was no doubt that the purchasing public were buyingrather more freely than they had been for some time past.  Oneof the most pleasing features in connection with his ownmanufacturing industry was that the north eastern oentre,Newcastle and the Hartlepools, which had been deplorablefor years past, was showing an unusual amount of life.
COKFIDEKTIAL.FOOD INDUSTRIES (CQtJTD).     In connection with export, the Continental market forthe food industries had, with one or two exceptions, ceased to exist-;  Holland was doing fairly well and developing,Germany was showing 3igns of development, but Italy was of noimportance, and in Spain wo were doing a little, but not asmuch as we should like.  The big market, France, and Belgiumtoo, no longer existed.     As regards other overseas trade, South America was aboutnormal, ahlle India remained still the most hopeful centre.Taking things generally, the export trade outside Europe loadmore life in It than at tills time last year, and everything -pointed to a better state of affairs in the future than we had had in the past.                       GENERAL TRADE.     LORD GAINFORD read the following extracts from theEconomic Supplement of January 31st, published by theFodoration of British Industries, respecting the condition and prospects of trade.          &quot;British prices con now be said to be broadly in     adjustment with world prices, and the complaint in regard     to Continental competition is becoming less a matter of     unfair undercutting of prices than of the general     unremunerative level of business in certain lines in all     countries alike, resulting from.&quot;the unfavourable course     of world prices generally.  The possibility of a firming     up of prices and a more profitable level of business     during the current year must largely depend on the course     of monetary events.          &quot;With regard to the future of Continental competition     it should perhaps be pointed out that the disappearance     of an export bounty resulting from currency depreciation     is frequently a rauchslower procesu than is generally     realised..  The fact, for example, that the French and     Belgian exchanges have been practically stable for     almost a year does not mean that the adjustments of their     internal prices have necessarily been completed.  There     are good grounds for believing that export premiums     still exist in both countries, though of gradually     diminishing amounts.  The prospect of their complete     extinction during the ourrent year should bring     encouragement to British manufacturers,  especially in     thos.i industries &apos; like wool and stoel which have been     heavy sufferers from their effects.  -          &quot;In conclusion it must bo emphasised that even if a     revival  of the pre-war trend of our trade is in prospect,     its progress is now likely to DO fairly slow as, since     its rate must depend on the rate at which credit is     allowed  to expand.in this and other European countries,-f-1-
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD).the uncertainty introduced Into the international financialoutlook by the action of the Chicago Reserve Bank is boundto have a restraining effect.  Even, however, if our exporttrade, and the older basic industries depending on it, is notto receive the fillip which was at one time hoped for, thereis no immediate reason to anticipate a set back in the recentupward trend of our trade in any event.  Our youngerindustries, such as for example artificial silk, motor cars,electrical goods and chemicals, should continue to go ahead.      &quot;Taking a broad survey of the world situation as a whole,there are many signs favourable to trade expansion;  harvestshave on the whole been good and sold at profitable prices;overseas markets, especially those within the Empire, areexhibiting signs of prosperity;  and, but for a few outstandingexceptions, such as China, the international trade barometercan be regarded as set fair&quot;.           MR. VYLE regarded the general state of business affairs,so far as one could ascertain, to be practically the same as whenthe Council members last reported.  The feature which he did not like was that there did not seem to be sufficient new businesscoming forward.                  Co-operative wholesale Society.     MR. HAYHURST wrote:-     &quot;Sales during the past month have been satisfactory in everysection of Grocery, Provision, Drapery and Furnishing, increasesbeing recorded in practically every section.  The figures presented to me of the trade during the past half-year shew remarkably goodincreases over the corresponding period of last year, this applying to almost every department.  The production of foodstuffs and alsothe productions of textile factories shew good increases.     &quot;Orooery and Provisions.  Colonial, Australian and New Zealandbutters are of good value, and supplies are being readily absorbedas each consignment arrives.  Stocks of chilled and pickled eggsgenerally are getting cleared, with the result that a littleattention is now being paid to fresh Irish.  There has been a gooddemand for Canadian cheese and stocks aro now getting low. Fairlyheavy arrivals of New Zealand cheese have taken place.  lancashire and Cheshire cheeses, as is usual at this time of the year, are small in supply.  It is stated that, a good start has been made withthe new sugar crop in Cuba, and as navigation on the Elbe Ispartially open, possibly there may be a keener desire to sell in thenear future.
CONFIDENTIAL.GENERAL TRADE. (CONTD.)Co-operative Wholesale Society. (Contd.).     &quot;Wheat.   There has been very little change of late in the market, exporting countries doing their utmost to resist a decline in price.   The recent market reportsrespecting Canadian wheat speak of continued increases in elevator stocks, and it is anticipated there will bea big carry-over at the end of the season.   Very finequalities of Australian wheat have recently arrived.  Itis stated that the financial position of Argentine farmersgenerally is now much better than during the last threeyears, and they are receiving every encouragement to fight against lower prices.     &quot;Tea, Cocoa, and Chocolate.  It is not likely thatthere will be eny break In the home tea market such as has been talked of by dealers.   As a matter of fact,if rains in Northern India are not heavier, a shortageof crop from that area is likely to eventuate.   It Isof interest to note that the consumption of tea In GreatBritain Increased by 7  million pounds during the lastyear.   The decline In the cocoa market both on the r?estAfrican coast and at home has been arrested since lastreport, and the war between specxilators and the combinesseems to have taken a turn against both.   Prices aredistinctly hardening, both at home and in Africa.   the african price is the basis for quotations for all othercocoas.   Since the end of last year there has been theusual lull in the output of chocolate from all homefactories.   The factories are now busy with Easter goods and for the export season.   Apart from this generality,the cotton areas at home are still suffering fromdepression, which is strangely reflected in the sale ofchocolates.&quot;GENERAL TRADE AND EANICING.     MR. CURRIE said that the three months bill rate hadbeen distinctly easier during the month of January.  Thiswould appear to be due to three causes:  the scarcity ofcommercial paper, the demand for bills from tho Continent,and, during the earlier part of the month, the expectation of a reduction of the Bank rate.   The three months rate at one time dropped to below 4;\, but during the last weekit had increased again.   Until last week there had been no scarcity of money, but a considerable stringency had arisen then which caused the market to have recourse tothe Bank of England.     The Clearing House Returns continued to show asatisfactory Increase.   The percentage of loans to bankdeposits was practically the same as a year ago, but lower than It was at the end of 1927.   The Stock Exchange hadbeen fairly active, and the British Government securitieshad continued to rise.

EMPLOYMENT.     MB. PHILLIPS said that the unemployment figures for thisyear had started at a high level on 2nd January, owing toan exceptionally heavy increase, amounting to no less than236,000, In the fortnight since 19th December.  This figurecontained, in addition to the normal constituents of workersdischarged -at Christinas or working short-time, a considerablenumber of workers stood off owing to the severe weather.  Thiswas particularly the case, of course, with the building trades,and apart from the effect of the weather, it was noticeablethat the building trade remained in rather a depressedcondition.     In the three weeks following 2nd January there hodbeen a degree of recovery which was on the whole encouraging,amounting in total to 158,000.   Some part of this reductionof 158,000, however, was probably due to persons of 65 years or over oeaBing to register.   It was part of the Old age pensions Scheme operating since the beginning of January,that persons of 65 or over could not draw unemployment benefit,and there was reason to think that a good many of those whowere previously registered as unemployed had gone off theregister.  It had not yet been possible to make a closeestimate of this number, but it might amount to 10,000 or20,000,CONDITIONS IN AUSTRALIA.     MR. SANuERSuN reported that as regards the pastoralposition, the rains in December and the ocoaslonal storms inJanuary had given partial relief to certain districts ofQueensland, and in New South Wales the conditions had improvedexcept in the South West portion.  Prices for sheep had gone up very considerably after the rains.  An official cablegramfrom Australia on the 19th January gave the CommonwealthStatistician&apos;s estimate of the wool clip from 1st July lastup to 30th June next aB 2,400,000 bales.  There was somediscrepancy in the figures quoted, but that was the latestofficial information available.  As regards wheat, the latestofficial estimate was a total of 109 million bushels, towhich West Australia had contributed 34-1- million, but theother States much less than usual.  It was expected therewould be a large surplus of sugar for export aB the totalsugar production was given in the official estimate as 500,000tons.   As regards dried fruits, all the stocks of Australiancurrants and raisins in the United Kingdom were believed tobe now cleared.  The  latest report of the damage due to thefrost,  which tir, Sanderson had referred to at previousmeetings in the latter part of 1927, was that the production would be reduced by 40 per cent, of last year&apos;s production.It had previously been variously estimated at from 20 to 80per cent.   There was a rather remarkable increase in the
CONDITIONS IN AUSTRALIA (OONTD.).amount of wine exported from Australia during the last threeyears.   In 1925 there had been a total of 1 million gallons,in 1926, if million, and in 1927, 4^ million.  As a percentage of the total quantity of wine from all sourcesImported Into the United Kingdom, the Australian proportionhad gone up from 5 par cent, in 1925 to 9 per cent, in 1926.and to 23 per cent, in 1927 - 4^ million gallons out of 18- -million -in the last mentioned year.  He understood that theoost of a bottle of v/ine as compared with whisky hadinduced a large number of people in this country to drinkwine instead of whisky, and that, apparently, was lnoreasing.     As regards finance, money continued in very strong demand and a period of some stringency was expected.  Sincethe 1st July, considerable amounts had been borrowed inLondon and New York by the Commonwealth and by the States,but their urgent requirements had now been met.  As the LoanOounoil, a lately constituted body, now included New SouChV/ales, financial oontrol was more effective.  The recentConversion Loan of  36 million, which had been floated inAustralia, had been underwritten by the Banks, who had been left with about 10 millions of the amount, but It wasexpeoted this would gradually be absorbed without much difficulty.     There was a statement by Mr. Bruce, in &quot;The Times&quot;that morning, rather significant, he thought, in regard to industrial peace.  Negotiations and discussions had been proceeding for some long time, and it was proposed toendeavour to find something on the basis of the MondConference.  Mr. Bruce had rather hesitated to deal with theposition by appointing a commission or anything of that kind,but he had wanted to get public opinion to back him in selecting oertain individuals from both sides.  Sir ArthurBalfour X&amp;Qe section on Steel, above) had raised the questionof the tariff and its variations, and Mr. Sanderson was afraid that this was a chronic oomplaint In the case ofAustralia.  It must be remembered, however, that tho tariff board had recently made a report to the commonwealth government dealing with the subject of increases of rates,and the Government would have that under consideration now.Owing to the reoont large loans, especially during the last six months, imports had increased very considerably, andthat v/as naturally giving a good deal of concern to the manufacturers in Australia.  Perhaps it was true to saythere was a  period of transition  juBt at present after aperiod of great prosperity, and a lot of adjustments wouldhave to be made.     As regards Australia&apos;s trade with Great Britain, theHigh Commissioner had published a statement on 25th January,which members of the Council might have seen.  Although thefigures given in individual instances shewed that there hadbeen decreases, Mr. Sanderson thought the position oouldbe summed up in this paragraph:-
3 0 U            CONDITIONS IN AUSTRALIA (OONTD.).          &quot;In 1013 Australia absorbed 6.5 per cent, of the     British exports, in 1925 8.2 per cent, and for the     first nine months of 1927 9.4 per cent.  The total     export trade in British produce and manufactures is     not more than 80 per cent, of the 1913 volumo, but     the trade to Australia has definitely increased, even     when full allowance Is made for ohanges in price     levels.&quot;     Tho statement gave particulars for different trades ofthe percentage share of total British exports consigned toAustralia.  In iron and steel, for instance, there weregalvanised plates, tinned plates, plates and sheets, tubes,bars and rods and so on, and thoy all shewed quite aconsiderable Inorease.   Galvanised plates rose frpm 13.7$In 1923 to 15.8$ in 1927, bars and rods from 20$ in 1923to 31$ in 1927, electrioal machinery from 12^$ to 18^$ and motor chassis from 50$ to 73%.  Although one heard a gooddeal of oriticlBm one naturally did not hear from those whosreceived benefits, and if the total volume of trade &quot;toAustralia shewed quite a considerable inorease, it should give satisfaction to Great Britain as a whole.     MR. SANDERSON aftorwords sent in a later oablegram,a summary of which follows:-         General rains fell over the Eastern States of     Australia during January, but falls in the interior of     Queensland were not as heavy as in December.  A very     successful harvest has conoluded in Y/estern Australia     and Darling Downs Queensland.   Results in other States     are below the average, but better than anticipated some     months ago.  Pastures and stock have much improved over     the greater part of the Commonwealth.          Although the estimated production of this season&apos;s     wool olip, 2,400,000 bales, is less than last year     there is every reason to believe this  year&apos;e clip will     realise more than last yearns.   The total estimated     wheat orop, 107,500,000 bushels, is 50 millions less     than last year.    A record production and export of     Apples and Canned Fruit is anticipated.   Late rains have     improved the wine prospects and a satisfactory vintage     is anticipated.          The Queensland Government has appointed a new body     oalled the Board of Agriculture, to co-ordinate all     State activities whose object is the development of     agriculture and primary production generally.  The     Board comprises representatives of the Departments of     Agriculture and Stock,and of Public Instruction, of the -     University Agricultural Committee of Direction of     Fruit Marketing, and several commodity boards dealing     with the business of rural interests.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR. HOSE wrote:-      &quot;During tho past month, the second official fore-cast of this season&apos;s production of cereals in Argentinahas been published.  The yield of wheat is placed at,500,000 tons, as compared with the first estimate thisseason of 6,530,000 tons and the final estimate of6,010,000 tons for the 1926-27 crop.   The corresponding figures for oats are 759,00C tons, against 940.000 and962,000, respectively, and those for linseed, 2,063,0f-0tons, against 2,160,000 and 1,755,000.  A privateestimate has been made in London, placing the totalyield of the current crops (including maize) in theRepublic at 18,298,000 tons, against 17,362,000 gatheredlast year.  There would thus appear to be every prospectof the harvest proving even better than that of 1926-27,which was itself bountiful.  In the London market, wheatprices have recently shown an easier tendency, but there appears justification for believing that activity inthe Argentine export trade during 1928 on a scalecomparable with    unprecedented movement recorded lastyear is not improbable.  The purchasing power ofArgentina has unquestionably been greatly enhanced duringthe past twelve months, the visible favourable balance of merchandise trade for  1927 having been in the neighbour-hood of $150,000,000 (gold), against an excess of imports in 1926 cf $30,33.8,000 (gold), and the improvement in conditions in the import trades continues, assisted in large measvire by the stabilised exchange.  An especiallysatisfactory feature of the situatloh is a broadening ofthe demand for textiles.      &quot;Uruguay is benefiting from the sane factors asArgentina;  sales are taking place more readily,  and market conditions are gradually improving.  Importers of textiles state that stocks have diminished considerably,and, in general, prospects are regarded as favourable.The state of the camps and cattle is good, and the yield of this season&apos;s wheat crop has been distinctly abovenormal, if not one of the largest in the history cf thecountry.      &quot;In Chile, the greatly increased sales of nitrateof soda have exercised a beneficial influence on theposition of the National Exchequer.  On 5Oth november last, the Chilean Minister of Finance placed before theParliamentary Budget Committee a statement showing theposition of the  national finances for 1927 up to the endof the previous month.  Accordingly to this report, theactual revenue for the twelve months is closely estimatedat $883,850,531.  It was calculated that the totalexpenditure for the twelve months would be $377,734,992,On tiiis basis, the ordinary revenue of the Republic during1927 is estimated to exceed the ordinary expenditure by$6,095,539.  These figures do not take Into accountcertain special items of revenue and expenditure, whichare estimated to balance.
                                  3**confidential.     &quot;The returns issued by the Chilean Customs Department,covering the Customs revenue for tho eleven months endedNovember, 1927, Indicate a very substantial Increase in thenational income derived from this source, the yield of theduties having boen $427,470,840, as against $382,519,544In the corresponding period of 1926.  T-he revenue fromnitrate export duties in the first eleven months of 1927was $200,637,125, against only $155,946,698 In January-November, 1926.  The former figure, although only coveringeleven months of 1927, exceeds by over $29,000,000 theestimated yield($171,40c,000) of the export duties onnitrate, specified in the 1927 Budget, covering the wholeof that year.  Despite the improvement in nitrate sales,the commercial situation remains very depressed.  Undoubt-edly, a restrictive influence on trade is the mass oflegislation rtiich is being passed, especially as this includes a measure for the revision of the Customs Tariff.The further development of &quot;nationalisation&quot; in the countryis reflected In a Law recently passed for the control of insurance business, under which, inter alia, severe finesare imposed in cases of insurance being effected abroad in contravention of the Act.     &quot;Trade conditions in Brazil remain quiet, there beingconsiderable stringency in the money market.  Coffee prices are steady, and the Coffee Institute is apparentlyrestricting the volume of stocks in the chief marketswithin certain definite limits.  The requisite six monthsnotice of the conversion of the currency on the basis of anew gold parity for the milrsls of 5.899d., under theDecree Law of 18th December, 1926, is still awaited, but,in the meantime, substantial gold reserves are beingaccumulated at the Stabilisation Office, the balance inhand at 31st December last having been 435,56U contos.This is approximately equivalent to  10,000,000 sterling,while it has been estimated that the amount of goldrequired to provide a backing for the note circulation of50 per cent, would be slightly in excess of  30,000,000.The Brazilian Budget estimates for 1927 provide for a smallsurplus of some 9,000 contos (paper), and, while theoriginal 1928 Budget estimates showed a deficit of 152,000contos (paper), the President of the Republic has apparently exercised his discretionary powers, modifying the  calculated expenditure so as to provide for a smallestimated surplus.  Talcing a full view of the situation,however, it is clear that a considerable measure of recovery must yet take place in the export trade of Brazilbefore the economic position of the country may be regardedas quite sound, especially In view of the large sumsrequired for the service of the external debt, on whichsinking fund payments were resumed as from 1st August,1927.     &quot;The basic eoonomic conditions at present prevailing in Peru afford reason for satisfaction.  Pendingdevelopments in regard to currency stabilisation, tradersare naturally disposed to exercise caution in entering into commitments, but some expansion in the Import tradeIs expected to result from the passage Into law of theBill revising tho Customs Tariff.  The new duties becameeffective on 2nd January last, and are on a higher basisthan those existing in 1926, but lower than those Inforce last yoar.-
SOUTH AMERICAN TR-OE.     &quot;Increased, trading activity In various directions inthe Colombian markets is reported, the replenishing of stocks having boon In progress in 9evoral ImportantDepartments of the Republic,  r. rapid advance has takenplace in values of real estate, especially in Barranquilla,There are still a large number of nov? buildings under construction, and, in consequence, a considerable increasehas occurred in prices of building materials.  Delays have again been reported in the clearance of shipping on theRiver Magdalena.     &quot;As fully anticipated, in vie?&apos; of the state of affairs in Mexico, that country has found it necessary to enterinto negotiations in New York with the international committee of Bankers, to whom it has been intimated thattho country is not in a position to resume, as from 1stJanuary, 1928, the full service of the sinking fund on itsdirect debt, as provided for by existing agreements.  TheGovernment invited the Committee to appoint experts to visit Mexico to examine the situation more fully.  meanwhile the acute commercial crisis in Mexico continues withoutalleviation.     &quot;Shipments of coffee from Ecuador have recently been on a fairly satisfactory scale, and the demand, while notvery pronounced, has been steady.  Arrivals of cocoa fromthe producing  centres have been normal for the time of year, but the market has been quiet. / Rather more optimismis expressed in regard to the commercial outlook,emanating from the Governments activity in the carryingout of public works and the introduction of measuresintended to improve general economic conditions,     &quot;The situation in Nicaragua has been characterised byrenewed political disturbances of a minor character, whichthe United States military forces at present in the country have been active in suppressing.  Apparently, the papifica-ticn of the country is virtually completed, but theGovernment has not yet been successful in negotiations forthe conclusion of a loan In New York for the purpose of satisfying claims arising from the civil war of last yearand to meet current commitments.  The annual Pan-AmericanConference (to which all the American countries normallysend representatives)  was opened in Havana during thecourse of January, and it Is understood that a tendency was shown on the part of some of the delegates to expresscriticism of the United States policy of exercising an arbitrary right to control political and economicconditions in Nicaragua, while criticisms were made of thehigh tariffs imposed in the United States on imports ofSouth and Central American prod\icts&quot;.
