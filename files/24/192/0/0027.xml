                II.-POSITION  IN CHIEF  INDUSTRIES.COAL MINING.    Very little change took place during the quarter in the employment positionof the Con I  Mining  Industry.  The wholly unemployment  figure rose slightlyduring the period, but, on the other hand, there was a considerable decrease in thenumber of persons temporarily stopped from work.IRON, STEEL AND TIN PLATE.    Employment in the heavy metal trades became somewhat slacker during the quarter.  In the pig iron trade  some recovery was made during October, but theposition worsened  during November.   Considerable  improvement  took place inthe tin plate industry, employment being better during the quarter than for sometime past.SHIPBUILDING  AND  SHIP-REPAIRING.    The improvement in  the shipbuilding position which was a marked feature ofthe first  nine months of 1D27  was more or less maintained during the quarter,although a very slight setback took place during  the last two months of the year.In the ship-repairing industry, however, an appreciable improvement  took  place during the quarter.ENGINEERING.    There was little change on the whole in the employment  position of theEngineering Industry.  Unemployment in the Constructional Engineering branchincreased slightly, but, on the other  hand, an improvement took place  in  marine engineering.TEXTILES.    Cotton. Employment  in the  American  Spinning Section remained veryirregular during the quarter.  The usual temporary improvement before Christmastook place, but  prospects  are still very uncertain.   In the  Egyptian Sectionemployment remained good.    Woollen and Worsted. Except in the Heavy Woollen branch  the employ -ment position of these trades improved during the quarter.    Other Textiles. In the hosiery and jute trades an appreciable recovery tookplace, but the lace trade showed a tendency to decline.BUILDING,  BRICK AND  TILE MANUFACTURE.    The  seasonal depression in  the  building trade was  somewhat  more markedlast quarter than usual, largely  because of the exceptional  inclemency  of  the weather and the termination of the housing subsidy.CLOTHING TRADES.    The usual seasonal increase in employment  was in evidence in the clothingtrade.  In the  boot and shoe  trade the improvements shown  at the  end of  thoSeptember quarter were maintained.
POTTERY.    Employment in the Pottery Industry  was fairly good  during October and november, but a slackness set in during the last month of tho year resulting in increased unemployment.TRANSPORT, DOCK  LABOUR AND SHIPPING SERVICES.    As is usual at this period  of the year transport and shipping services showssome decline.  Employment at the docks was very slack during the quarter.(
     III. WORK  INSTITUTED  FOR,  RELIEF  OF UNEMPLOYMENT.                               Numbers Employed.          [See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24) ).]     The  table which follows  has been prepared  to  show,  so far as information is available, the number of men employed on  works instituted, with financial assistancefrom the  Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.     Scope  of  Table. The  schemes  included  are  those   undertaken  by  local and  other Authorities  and  Public  Companies  with a   financial  contribution from  the  State  with  the   object   of  relieving  unemployment;  and  works in  respect of  which  guarantees  have been  given  under  the  Trade  FacilitiesActs  as   capital   undertakings   calculated   to  promote   employment  in   thiscountry.   Schemes  to which  State  financial  assistance   is  given,  but  whichare  not  undertaken  primarily  for the  relief of  unemployment  (e.g.,  HousingSchemes), and works put  in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance arenot  included.   Certain other schemes  involving  Government assistance  are  alsoexcluded in view of the impracticability of  ascertaining the exact number of men whoare directly provided with employment thereby;  these include the Export credits scheme and contracts  for equipment,  clothing,  &amp;c,  accelerated  by GovernmentContracting Departments.     Method of Compilation. The figures for  the  Road   and  Bridge  Schemesassisted  by  the   Ministry  of  Transport  and  for  schemes  assisted  by   theUnemployment Grants  Committee  are  (with  the  exception  of  certain road schemes  in respect  of which  returns are  received   direct  by the  Ministry  ofTransport)  obtained  from  returns  received  at  Employment  Exchanges from local  and  other   Authorities  and   Public   Companies.    Those  relating   to schemes assisted  under the  Trade Facilities  Acts are  compiled  by the  TradeFacilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whomguarantees under the Acts have been given.Works assisted by 	Number of Men employed at 				Dec. 31,1927.

The figures take no account of the employmentprovided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.    S The decrease in the number  employed at December 31, 1927, is largely accounted for by the suspension-sion of many schemes, owing to severe weather conditions.    t These figures indicate meu employed on the work itself.  They include part only of the men employedon the  manufacture  of the materials used.  They take no account of the labour involved in winuiug.transporting.  &amp;c, raw materials.    Note. No distiuctiou is now made between the Forestry Commission^ normal and relief work, audgrants for afforestation form part of the normal  programme.  The average number of forest employeesengaged on the Commission^ operations (including Crown woods) during the quarter ended December 31,1927,was 2,870 as compared with 2,643 for the corresponding quarter of 1926....
                                                IV.- OVERSEA SETTLEMENT.                                                       (Dominions Office,)    Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act  to make bettor provision  for furthering British settlement  in His  Majesty&apos;s OverseaDominions), various schemes have been agreed with  Dominion  Authorities.  This  Act, as its title implies, is  not one of the government measures designed to deal with unemployment, and should not be so regarded.    For many years before and after the war, the natural increase of population exceeded the net migration movement by about 300,000 ayear, but recently the gap between the natural increase and  the net migration  movement has tended to diminish.  During 1920. the natural increase in England, Scotland and Wales was 279,775, and  the  net migration  movement was 103,9(59.  Consequently,  the natural increase during the year, after deducting the net migration, was 175,800.    The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the months of October. November and December, 1927(with the corresponding figures for the year 192(1), and for the nine months ended the 31st December, 1927 and 192(5, respectively, arc set outin the following Table:                   QUARTERLY Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of ExchequerAssistance.  For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of theextent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to,  and  not  in substitution of, the  detailed  information  given  in  the Tablesthemselves.

The net capital cost of these schemes upto the 31st March,  1926,  when  the Land Settlement  Scheme came to an end, isestimated to be  15,250,000. of which approximately  14.050,000 (net) was loanedby the Public Works Loan Board.   Interest in respect of such loans is payable byCouncils.  Under Section 26 of the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, theExchequer bears the loss incurred up to the 31st March, 1926, on the Councils&apos; SmallHoldings account (e.g., due to charging a fair as opposed  to an economic rent), sofar as such loss had been reasonably and  necessarily incurred.     As from the  1st April. 1926. the Exchequer assistance takes the form of annualcontributions to meet the difference between the loan charges and the estimated net income  from the Councils&apos; estates.  These contributions which  did not commenceuntil the year  1927. will vary  from year to year, and  their total capitalized valuecannot at present be estimated.     In  Scotland  land settlement is not conducted  through the  agency of CountyCouncils.     Ministry&apos;s  Settlements. Since  1916  a  number  of properties  have  been acquired, and the capital expenditure thereon and the difference,  if any, betweenthe annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders  is being borne by the Exchequer.  Some of these properties have been disposed of and the net expenditure on the remainder does not involve an appreciablecash call upon the Exchequer, as  additional capital expenditure is met  from thesurplus cash revenue or from proceeds of sale of property.

After the Armistice, Juvenile Unemployment Centres were opened in certainlocalities to deal with the problem of unemployed juveniles.   After a period of closure centres were again established, and the cost, which was originally shared bythe Board of Education and Local Authorities, was, from the 1st April, 1923, to the31st March, 1924,  partly met out of Relief of Unemployment Vote by grants up to75 per cent, in  respect  of approved schemes, the Local Authority providing theremaining 25 per cent.  From the 1st April, 1924,  the Exchequer Grant was, as anemergency measure, for  so long as unemployment amongst juveniles remains acute,raised to 100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses of Local EducationAuthorities.    From the 1st April, 1926. the Exchequer Grant was revised as follows : (1.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rale of unemployment among insured        juveniles exceeded 0 per cent, during the twelve months which ended on the        23/r/ November, 1925.    A per capita grant fixed by the Minister for each Authority separately equalto the approved  average weekly cost to the Authority of each Juvenile in averageattendance,  taking into account recurrent expenditure  only,  during the twelvemonths which  ended on the 30th June, 30th September, or 31st December, 1925,whichever was the  latest period  for which consecutive claims had been  received.  Ifcomplete figures  for one year ending on one of the above dates  wore not available,or if the Authority had not previously opened Centres, the per capita grant was fixed by  the Minister on such  information, including the Authority^&apos; proposals for1926 , as was available to him.(2.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured        juveniles was not less than 3 per cent, and not more than 6 per cent, during        the twelve months which ended on the 23rd November,  1925.    Either (i) a per  capita grant calculated as in (1) above, but equal  to three-quarters only of the approved average  weekly cost, or (ii) a grant of 75 per  cent.of the approved out-of-pocket expenditure incurred  by the Authority during thefinancial yea* 1D20. as Khe Authority chose.SCHEMES FOR TRAINING  WOMEN AND JUVENILES AND YOUNG UNEMPLOYED FIT MEN.

The Ministry of Labour is conducting, as an experimental measure, a scheme oftraining for the benefit of young unemployed men between the ages of 19 and 25 (upto 29 for ex-service men) of a class who, owing to the prolonged trade  depression,have  had no  opportunity of  learning  a skilled  trade.

Normally no grant is payable, but if in the case of a County  Council theAuthority  can show  that  there  are clearly  denned  districts  where  the averagepercentage of insured juveniles unemployed (luring the year was definitely abnormal,the Minister is prepared in approved cases to sanction grant as in (2) above in respectof expenditure on Centres serving these districts.
