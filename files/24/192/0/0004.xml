TRADE OUTLOOK.       Note by the Preaidant of the Board of Trade.     I circulate for the information of my colleagues a record of the meeting of my Advisory Council held in January.     On the whole the views expressed are hopeful for thefuturej and I incline to disagree with Sir Josiah Stamp1 opinion that there is no more justification for this optimismthan there was in past years.     The inoreaeed preference under tho New Zealand tariffis as valuable as it is welcome.     The December trade figures look bad; but it would bounwise to draw conclusions from these as the combined effect ofChristmas holidays and exceptionally bad weather is enough to account for a considerable falling off *                                    P.O.-L.gQBKC.O.P. 4 (28).Board of Trade,    18th January, 1928.

Annex.THE TRADE OUTLOOK.lbli
NEK ZEALAND CUSTOMS TARIFF.     THE PRESIDENT said that, as the members of tho AdvisoryCouncil would be aware, since the last Council meeting full particulars of the now Tariff of New Zealand had been published.   Greatly increased preferences for Bx-itish good3had been accorded, and there would be wide-spread appreciationin the United Kingdom of this generous action on the part ofthe Dominion Government,   The President was confident thatit would redound greatly to the benefit both of this countryand of New Zealand.     The Council cordially concurred.COAL.     MR, YjaRHAM stated that during December some improvementin volume of output had occurred, chiefly owing, of course, tothe severe weather which had helped the collieries who supply the household trade.  On the other hand, the storms at seahad caused very serious dislocation in shipping, and some ofthe collieries which depended on making shipments had beenhard put  to it,  The net result, however, had been that ineach of the first three weeks of December the output had risen to a little over the five million ton mark.  For the weekending December 17th, it was 5,553,000 tons, or 102.2$ of the march 1925 weekly average basis.  The actual increase had been114,000 tons, and^the number of persons employed in theindustry was 86.5/5, calculated on the same basis.Unemployment for the month of November had been 18.5$, orslightly  less than in October.  The quantity of coal exported from this country in November was 4,126,700 tens as comparedwith 4,141,000 tons in October;  and the value was again 2d.per ton less than the previous month.     The export of coal from the United Kingdom to Norway,Sweden &quot;and Denmark, continued to fall;  for the month ofNovember  it had been only 468,000 tons, comparod with the monthly average in 1913 of 825,000 tons and in 1925 of605^000 tons.   This was owing, of course, to the competition of Polish coal.  To Germany we had exported 385,000 tons inNovember  against a monthly average of 746,000 tons in 1913and of 347,000 tons in 1925.  This was largely owing to thelicencing restrictions in Germany.  To France we hadexported  713,000 tons last November as against the monthly average of 1,065,000 tons in 1913 and of 853,000 tons in1925.  The outputs of Germany, Franoe, Poland and Belgium inOctober all showed increases over September, the increase inGermany being 378,000 tons.
COAL (CONTD.)     It was with great satisfaction that the British ooaltrade learned of the cancellation of the French licencingdecrees;  this would be a considerable help to the coal trade here in exporting to France, but at the same time they had been informed that the French colliery owners haddemanded an increase in the French import duty on coal, andthat it was proposed to raise the present duty of two francsto six francs per ton as from 1st April.  It was understoodthat the proposal had not yet been passed by the Senate,but that it was almost certain to come, the argument being that, with the present rate of exchange, the new duty would amount practically to the level intended by the dutyprescribed in the Tariff.  No??, however, that the licencingdecree had been terminated there was no longer anycompulsion as to the coal the French v;ere to use, except as regards a certain amount of reparation coal;  and nodoubt their public utility concerns, such as the gas works,would prefer to buy good British gas coal even with ahigher duty.  It showed, however, the disposition there was at present to prevent coal corning in.     The proposals for controlling prices which were beingconsidered in South males and in Yorkshire, Derbyshire andNotts, were now more or less generally known.  The Welshscheme was for fixing minimum, prices, and compensating thosecollieries which could not dispose of their whole output at such prices.  The Yorkshire scheme aimed at capturing theexport trade now done by the normal exporting districts ofthis country by means of taking advantage of the home tradeassured to that district by its geographical position.  the exporting districts looked upon these proposals with a gooddeal of apprehension.     The only other point needing mention was only in embryonow;  it was the question of a Consortium in Italy to dealwith reparation coal.  Three million tons were going in toItaly, and it was being considered whether it would be advisable to appoint one office to deal with the whole of it.There was rather  a fear on the part of importers that theidea might spread further, as was proposed before by theItalians, and was proposed but upset in Spain quite recently.     MR. FAULKNER remarked that, a letter had been receivedfrom the Reparation Commission saying that the Head of theCoal Bureau estimated that the total of Italy1s drawingsfrom Germany this year would not exceed those during thepast year,     THE PRESIDENT said that this was much more satisfactorythan might have been anticipated.  There was an interestingpoint to note about the importations of sea-borne and othercoal into Italy, and the question of our Treaty rights.  a careful analysis of coal consumption in Italy had been made,and the result of all the water-power schemes had not been to diminish the coal consumption, but the prosperity of thecountry had so increased that the total consumption ofcoal had gone up.
GAS  INDUSTRY.     MR. CA. HILL reoalled that at the November meeting ofthe Advisory Council he had reported that discussions were taking place in the chemical trade with regard to proposals forgas legislation.  He had now to report that the various groups of the Association of British Chemical Manufacturers concerned had separately considered those proposals, and representativesof those groups had had joint di3CU3sion3 with representativesof the gas industries.  A3 a result an understanding had been finally reached, BO that the Association would not take anypart in opposing the proposals.      THE PRESIDSScT considered this very satisfactory.  he desired to explain to the Council that while he did not thinkit possible to get legislation passed in a crowded Sessionsuch as the next one promised to be, he wa3 anxious to have at his disposal the considered view of the gas industry andof all the industries that work partly in alliance and partly in competition with it, - and to get from the National FuelCouncil a considered view, - as to what modifications and extensions of existing ga3 legislation might well be proposed,in order that whenever an opportunity offered we could beready with a prepared plan.     SIR DAVID MILNE-WATSON observed that there had been further reductions in the price charged for gas since the last meetingof the Advisory Council.  Sales of gas had been very heavy and had constituted a record output for the Christmas period,no doubt due to there being more money.  Practically no changeshad occurred with regard to the residixal markets since thelast meeting.IHOK AND STEEL.     MR. PUGH reported that there was some indication ofimprovement in the heavy branch of the industry, so far asvolume of employment was concerned.  There was naturally a gooddeal of 3pecu.legislation.0n as to how matters would turn out duringthe present year, but, as to the past year, it would probablybe found, when the December figures came out, that our production of steel during tho year had been somewhat over 9million tons; that was to say that the total would be at least one million tons in excess of our full productive capacity in pre-war days.  Mr. Pugh could not see how, short of getting a greater proportion of our home orders, thattotal was going  to be improved upon in the current yearunless there was a general development of world trade.Taking the net exports of the different producingoountries as the basis of calculation, it might beestimated that the outside market represented less than
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.)15/&apos; of world producing capacity.  Our  own production for1026, whilst, as already said,  it was  over 1 million tons.in excess of our pre-war capacity of production,  obviouslyfell short of our productive  capacity  to-day, which should perhaps be estimated  in the region  of  12-?r million tons.It might be that we should get  somewhat better  prices  thisyear, if - as had been done in  Germany, - our principalcompetitors attended  more to  the labour conditions in  their industries,  rhich -vould result  in a mitigation  of  theirlow-priced competition.     Generally speaking, however, the  Iron and  Steel TradesConfederation did not anticipate very  substantial  improve-ment in the volume of trade for 1927.  They could not  seethe existence of factors which  were going to cause any great improvement in that respect.  The disadvantage  we  suffered fromwas, of course, that  our production, substantial  as it appearedto be, was production from plant of much  higher productivecapacity, and this obviously  affected  overhead  charges inrelation to unit of production, and reflected itself also inthe price.  3ut, like everyone  else, the  workmens1Organizations were hoping for an improvement.     MR. 30ND said that there had been a certain feeling ofoptimism in some branches of the iron and steel industry on the occurrence of a new year.  It was extremely difficult to say how much that feeling should be discounted to get at the realfacts.  In the United States there was extraordinaryconfidence in the prospects of the iron and steel industry for the coming year, but general dissatisfaction prevailedabout the low prices at -vhich they had been selling.  However,they seemed assured of a large business, and any fear we might have had that bad trade over there would cause alarge exportation of their products to other countries seemedto have disappeared.     Certainly the latest figures of our own production gave no ground for excessive optimism, since the furnaces in blast atthe end of November were 7 less than.at the beginning ofthat month, while production of pig iron had been 21,000 tonsles3 in November than in the previous month.  The output ofsteel ingots and castings at 698,700 tons was practicallythe same in November as in October.   Imports of iron andsteel in November totalled 204,800 tons, a very welcome dropof some 50,000 tons compared with the previous month; buttoo muoh importance must not be attached to the figures ofa single month.  The price quoted recently bv a German firmfor sheet bars, which was one of the semifinished productsimported, was one of the lowest we had had for some time.
IKON AND STEEL (CONTD.).     The heavy iron ana steel trade were naturally enteringupon 1928 with order books much less i&apos;ull than at thebeginning of 1927, when they were swollen by the arrearsaccumulated during the coal stoppage.  But on the whole therewas reason to hope that the industry would be on a more- evenkeel throughout .1928; and while the high figures obtained in the Spring of 1927 were not looked for, it might reasonably be anticipated that production figiu^es would noc fall seriouslybelow the latest recorded figures (which were for November),and might possibly slightly rise.     Perhaps the most encouraging figures were those which showed that world demand was increasing, for world productionof steel rose from 91,700,000 tons in 1926 to 98,720,000 tonsin 1927, and world production of pig iron from 77,740,000 to84,070,000 tons,  production of steel outside the United Statesrose from 43,410,000 tons in 1926 to 54,320,000 tons in 1927,to which rise the United Kingdom contributed 5,450,000 tons,so that the world absorbed the steel which we were able toproduce last year.  In the case of pig iron, production outsidethe United States rose from 38,370,000 tons to 47,870,000 tons,to which increase the United Kingdom contributed 4,790,000 tons.There was some reason to hope- that Continental prices would riseduring the year;  and, as the margin between British and continental costs decreased, a greater share of the world Jemandshould come to this country.     The German dispute on the subject of the 8 hours day hadbeen settled by the issue of the award of the Governmentarbitrator, which the Government had made binding on both parties.  In basic 3essemer works the three-shift system wasto be introduced from January 1st, 1923, whilst the open-hearth, electric and crucible steel works were to adopt thethree-shift system as from January 31st, 1923, unlessindividual exceptions should be granted.  The arbitrator hadconceded a very siaall increase in hourly wages, which meant that the aggregate weekly earnings of the men would be considerably reduced.  3oth sides were dissatisfied with theAward, but some of them accepted it in the meantime because  fc .of the Government order.     In view of the decision of the Cleveland ironmasters lastmonth to reduce the price of pig iron, it wes interesting to note that French producers ox1 phosphoric foundry pig iron hadinoreased their prices by 5 francs per ton for home oonsumers;but the object of this increase was understood to be that abonus should be given to those firms who would take export business.  The amount of the bonus was to be 25 francs, or a subsidy of 4/- per ton on export business at the expense ofthe home consumer of 9-jrd. per ton.
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).     In south iVales conditions were decidedly better, and thetin plate industry was working at from 75 to SO per cent of capacity as compared with under 60 per cent during July,August and September.  The exports of tin plates from theUnited States to other countries had fallen very considerably.Any substantial improvement, however, in the position of theiron and steel industry in 1920 could hardly be expected under present condition  of free imports. They required the Jritishindtistry to be 20^ more efficient than the Continental, whilstoperating at 70&apos;? of oapacity, which was an obviousimpossibility.STEEL.     SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR wrote:-     &quot;There has really been very little change in thesituation in the Sheffield trade.  The holidays have been considerably extended owing to stock-talcing and the factthat there ha3 been no pressure of orders.  A fair amountof export orders have come in during the last few days,but it is too early to tell what the trend of business is going to be in the month of January&quot;.NON-FERROUS METALS.    SIR CECIL BUDD was able to report very briefly that theslight improvement in the metal trades, to which he had referred at the last meeting of the Advisory Council, v/asbeing maintained,  iiost works seemed to have got, so far asvolume wan concerned, larger order books than they had had fora considerable time past.  The prices, however, were probably not&apos; very profitable.  On the whole Sir Cecil thought thatthe outlook watp fairly encouraging.  The prices of metals werelow and there was general confidence that they had got aslow as they were likely to be; so that there was every reasonfor those who desired to place orders to come along ynd place them.ENGINEERING.     SIR ERNEST FETTER considered that as regards 1928 manu-facturing engineers felt a restrained optimism.  November 1927the latest month for which figures were as yet available - wasthe record post-war month for machinery exports, ivhich
ENGINEERING. (CONTD.)reached a total of 58,243 tons.   This figure in factslightly exceeded the monthly average for 1913.   the eleven months&apos; export of machinery, January-November,19^7, amounted to 469,613 tons, against 439,397 tonsand 469,219 tons in the corresponding periods of 1926and 1925 respectively.   To that extent, of course,this year&apos;s figures were satisfactory; but in the firsteleven months of 1913 the exports of machinery had been636,518 tons.   Another point was the very low price wegot for our exports of machinery as compared with theprice of imported machinery.   The average declaredvalue of these exports in November 1927 was about  93, per ton, against an average declared value of  151.8 perton for machinery imported in the same month.  That wasa very important matter from the point of view of skill and quality of labour.   We were, no doubt, importing onan average a much higher class of machinery than we wereexporting.   There was a marked decrease in our exportof machinery to India which, it was hoped, however, wouldbe countered by reason of the better results India hadbeen getting from our goods; but there existed a strongtendency in India to place orders for machinery on theContinent at the present time.     There had been a further slight reduction in thepercentage of unemployment in the engineering trade, andno doubt the most serious tiling in engineering at the .moment- was the very unsatisfactory prices that wereobtainable if any business was to be got at all.     Certain tendencies were giving rise to anxiety to manufacturing engineers.  One had been mentioned by Mr. Carbarnthe feeling in the coal trade that they could call upon theother trades to subsidise the export of coal.  But theengineering trade in particular was working on such smallmargins that it had no money to subsidise coal exports.Then as regards Safeguarding, to some extent the manufac-turing engineers were must sympathetic, but taken piece-meal it was a tendency which they did not regard favourably     MR,  LINDSAY remarked that the proportion of British-made machinery in India continued to be very satisfactory.The great bulk was bought from this oountry.     THE PRESIDENT referred to another side of the matter which required attention, namely the great efforts whichthe Americans were making to push their engineering pro-ducts in India.   T7ith Indian buying power going up, we ought to be adequately represented there.     MR.  LINDSAY suggested that a great difficulty had beenthat so many manufacturing firms in England had been oon-tent to be represented in India by agents.  It was onlycomparatively reoently that they had started branches inIndia.     SIR ERNEST PETTER agreed thst the agency system inIndia was absolutely bad.  There had been for some yearsnow a strong feeling against that cheap and easy way of trying to get business,  and in favour of a more enter-prising method.
ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.     SIR PHILIP NASH observed that in the year that had closed,there had really been very little change in the situation.  Inthe home market the Bales of heavy electrical plant had bsonbelow normal.  That was undoubtedly due, as would berealised, to the Central Electricity Board being formed andto the holding up of central station work until their planewere complete and published.  Their first ooheme for Scotlandhad been published, and they had oalled for tenders which were before them that day for tho first part of the plant.  Asthe schemes of theirs&apos; were published and accepted, rises inthe home market demand would follow.  Power stations, about which there could be no doubt that they would form part of aohain, were going ahoad in placing their orders.  It was the stations on the fringe, the smaller stations, as to whichthere were doubts.  There wore some 500 stations in thisoountry, and  only about 10 or 15 of these were  selectedstations, so that there were a great number of small stationswhich were not extending today but otherwise would probably have been  extended.     As to the smaller plant, - small application stuffas it was oalled, - the home market was probably more orloss normal at the moment.  As regards exports, the yearthat had lately closed would probably show that the manufacturers of Great Britain had held their own, and thoreseemed to be no reason why the coming yoar should not be asgood ae last year.MOTOR OAR MANUFACTURE.     SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT wrote:-     &quot;At the last meeting of the Advisory Council, when Iwas urging the importance of modifying the system of ratingCommercial Vehicles for taxation, sc that when british manufacturers are trying to soli abroad, there should be no opportunity for foreign rivals saying that the Britishvehicles have been specially designed to comply with conditions imposed by taxation at home which provent thoirbeing the most suitable for foreign service, the Presidentrather suggested that motor vehicle manufacturers had already received a large measure of support and assistance from theGovernment, and that it was unreasonable to ask for anythingfurther.  But I think it must be recognised that it isneoacsary to do ovo.ryth.ing possible to assist the motor vehicle industry xa ovary way to develop export business.While the commercial vehicle has been proportionately moresuucassful than the car side, it ha3 to face the most severecompetition in overseas markets and cannot afford to be hampered in any way.
               MOfUR CAR MANUFACTURE  (CONTD *) .     &quot;It is well rsccgnieed  that  this country does  not  get a fraction of the overseas trade,  particularly  in theDominions and Colonies, which  should  legitimately come  to it from the sale of cars.  While  British manufacturers maybe to blai^o in some ways, there is no doubt  that tho systemof taxation which has forced manufacturers  to make  oarswith small-size engines has  been  mainly  to  blame.   About ayear ago it was suggested that the small  British car was going to find an enormous market  overseas,  but  it has not done so.  There are at the present time  in  Australia verylarge numbers unsold in the  agents&apos; hands and,  only a week or so ago, ono of the British  firms who  for  several years had done a  good business in making the smaller  sizes of cars,published ita balance she9t  showing over  100,000 loss,  mainly due to  the cancellation of a large export order.     &quot;Thoro will always be different views  on schemes oftaxation from different sections  of tho  community,  and  i recognise the difficulty of  getting them all  to support thesame alteration, but I suggest that the  oxport  business inmotor vehicles (with all the trades connected with  theirmanufacture) is so important to the country  that the Governmentshould  take action to ensure the  production  of  types herewhich will find a ready sale abroad.  It  is  difficult to getaccurate figures of imports, owing to the way in which  the returns are made, which do not clearly show  the number  of vehicles which are produced  from  imported unassembled parts,but it  is certain that the imports for the last two years arenot less than 23,000 plus 35,000  = 58,000.  The production ofthis additional number of vehicles in the country would havethe result of the employment of 55,000 men.   If we  tako theimports of foreign vehicles  into  Australia,  Now Zealand andSouth Africa for&quot;the last two  yoars and  compare them with theBritish imports, you will find they are  6 times as  many.  If-only half the imported vehicles to these  three  Dominions hadbeen made in thi.3 country, it  would have  resulted in theemployment of 75,000 men,     &quot;The importance of these  two sources of  employment is such that the Society of Motor Manufacturers  and Traders ispreparing a Memorandum to be submitted to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade,  inwhich alterations to the present  system  of taxation will be urged,  with the object of making  the  scale more elastic, andfacilitating the construction  of  passenger  and  goods vehiclessuitable for world requirements and at tho  same time popularin the  home market.  Copies  of this Memorandum  will be  saatto the  Advisory Council of the Board  of  Trade,  and  in viewof its  national importance,  it i3  hoped  that  thay will  exerttheir influence to secure the  objects of the Memorandum.&quot;
COTTON.     SIR KENNETH STEWART stated that, as regards the distrlbut-ing end of the trade, the revival in the principal Easternmarkets mentioned at the Council last month hau continued and increased.  Indian houses had been buying steadily all lastmonth and there had been an additional apurt during the past week or ten days, whereas at this time last year the buyinghad hardly commenced.  China was showing some signs of activity, though the amount of her orders showed a sad falling off from the usual quantities.  Temporarily, however, there seemed to be a little more tranquillity, especially up the Yangtse, which was aiding trade a little.  Other Far Easternmarkets, such as Java and Bangkok, had shown greater interest,especially Java which for three years had apparently beensuffering rather badly from overstocking.     The European, American and home trades had been fairlynormal during the past month.  South American businessthroughout the year had been pretty good.  On the wholeDecember had proved rather more encouraging than most of theprevious months this year.  It was exceedingly diffioult totell what the outlook v/ould be, but the encouraging reports wewere getting from India, which was our biggest market,inspired the hope that matters this year would improve alittle on 1927.  For 1927 had on the whole not been a very good year, although distinctly an improvement on the previous year, chiefly on  account of the raw material prices tendingslightly all the year to rise, whereas for several proviousyears prices had continually tended to fall, which always madetrade exceedingly difficult.     MR. LEE said that his report on the producing ^nd of  thecotton trade could not at the present time be a good one.   Inthe branch which used Egyptian cotton, which was possiblyone-fifth or one-quarter of the whole, they were keeping the mills full running and their workpeople fully employed: but inthe great bulk of the trade, the trade using American cotton,the same unfortunate position still existed, spinning millswere running short time, and a great number of the loomsmanufacturing the heavy goods were still on short time.There did not really seem to be any reasonable prospect of anear resumption of full-time working.  The only bright spotobservable in the situation was that the trade was beginning to appreciate that a great many causes were contributing tothis shortage, and were starting to canvas the whole situation with a view to finding, if they could, some means of making it possible to resume full-time.  It was satisfactory thatthe trade was seriously setting itsolf to work to find out\that was wrong and how it could be put ri^ht.  Of course thisshould have been done some time ago,  but it was better to  dvit now, even though it was rather late, than leaving things to drift.  What the result v/ould be,  of oourse it wasimpossible at the present time to say.
COTTON (CONTD. ).     THE PRESIDENT said that he had been asked from time totime whether he would intervene and set up an enquiry, but hehad taken the line that it was not his business to try to run the cotton trade.  Anything he could usefully do, he would do;but the obvious thing for the members of an industry whichwas so very complicated, and where relations between employersand workpeople had been so close, was to sit down and workout their own proposals, and not to come to the Board of Trad ato have proposals workod out for them.  TJo had heard at theCouncil table for the last two years, in our reviews offoreign markets, that as compared with many other exporting countries we were not losing any ground, but we had toconsider the Increased activity of the internal producer in countries protected by tariffs, and on account of thatinternal producer we had to face the fact that, for some years at any rate, we could not sell the same amount of cotton goodsas we did formerly.  That was the position to which theindustry had to adapt itself; that was really all the Boardof Trade could say; and that was the kind of thing which was much better said quietly round the table by the industry itself.     MR. LSE agreed.  If there was not work in the world forthe whole of the spindles and the whole of the looms, thefirst ones to stop must bo those here, because we could notto-day produce at as low a prioe as foreign countries could.That higher cost of production resulted from a considerablenumber of things - rates, taxes, the cost of freight andcarriage, wages, hours of labour, and the finance of the millsthemselves.  All those things could be better discussed, to begin with at any rate, by the trade itself than by aCommission.Y700L.     MR. ARTHUR SHAW pointed out that a fairly long report onwool had been submitted at the last meeting of the AdvisoryCouncil, and the position had not materially changed since then.  As far as the Bradford worsted trade was concerned,ilr. Shaw&apos;s last report had been a fairly good one.  that position was maintained, and his Association^ figuresindicated that, for the four weeks ending 28th Deoember, thelatest period for which they could be obtained, the average number signing the unemployment book was 5.8/s, this being the lowest figure during the whole of the twelve months.  Theactual percentage on the 28th of the month was 6.14$,  asagainst 13.07$ in December 1926.  That figure would coverpractically the Bradford district and the Keighiey and Shipleydistricts, which was an area representative of the worstedsection of the industry.
WOOL (CONTD.)     In the heavy woollen trade, unfortunately, theunemployment average for the month of December was 21.1$.At 28th December It reached 21.81$, as against 23.06$ inDecember 1926.  In particular, the Batley district seemedvery bad indeed; and when one turned to the similar classof trade in the Yeodon area it was rather astounding tofind 25yc of the employees signing the unemployment books Inthe area, - the percentage had got steadily worse everyweek for 12 weeks.  These were figures of the actual numberswho were signing the vacant books, but it did not necessarily follow that they were all totally unemployed.  It was difficult to separate the totally unemployed from the short-time workers.     The Euddersfield and Halifax trade remained very steady,the average figure for unemployment during December being6.9$.  The figure at December 28th had been 7.74$, as against10.43$ in December last year.  This was the general finecloth trade.  In the West Riding as a whole, the unemploymentfigure at December 28th was 11.08$ as against 15.02$ inDecember 1926.     The reports received the previous week from the West ofEngland and also from Scotland were very good.  Trade therewas apparently very flourishing; there was very littleunemployment at all, and they were working full time.     THE PRESIDENT remarked that the figures given by Mr.Shawat the last meeting of the Council, as distinguishing; woollensfrom worsteds, had been examined and, substantially, verified.It seemed almost impracticable to secure from traders Ingeneral really accurate figures because, for Instance, a merchant who was accustomed to deal in woollens would, inmaking his retvirns, describe all his goods as woollens,irrespective of any worsteds which might from time to time beincluded In them, - and converselT.  The Board of Trade would try, however, to get some improvement Introduced in thisrespect.     MR. AYKEOYD wrote:-      &quot;Since our meeting in December the markets here havegradually  strengthened; this applies particularly to  thelast  fourteen days.  Confidence  is increasing, and  in theworsted  section there  is  a feeling that we may expect ratherbetter trade.   At  the present  time there are  about  70$ of theCombs  in the  district running,  but it must be borne in mind that  this  is  a  period of  the year when  the new olip has not come  to  hand,  so  that stocks on the spot are  at a ratherlow ebb.      &quot;The  quantity of  spinning machinery running  since december is  rather higher and  will be in  the neighbourhoodof 90$.   Some  seotions  are  quite busy,  notably the  singleyarn trade for  export to  Germany.
                        WOOL (CONTD.)     &quot;The manufacturers are not well placed and 60% will cover the number of looms running.  In this section of thetrade the high cost of production reflects more than in any-other, and consequently competition from abroad Is so severeas to take orders which would otherwise come here.     &quot;One cannot help but feel that if the West Riding could get Its cost of production down, all would benefit, as slowlyand gradually the cost of production is going up abroadalthough it is still very much under anything in this country,     &quot;Jn the Batley and Dewsbviry trades there is little change to report from December.  The piece trade shows nochange, short time is prevalent and some firms are stillrunning three days per week.  The blanket makers are stillwell employed and business keeps up well in this section.     &quot;Woollen Yarns in this district.  Makers are runningfull time and fairly well employed.  Speaking generallyregarding this district business Is quite as good as November-December but is not running to full capacity all round.  the raw material markets abroad all show a hardening tendency andthere is a more general competition, all countries buyingfairly freely with the exception of the United States.&quot;     COLONEL WILLEY wrote :-     nIn the wool textile industry, seasonal arrivals of woolhave improved employment in combing.  Worsted spinners are receiving more particulars, and are better situated.   Inworsted weaving a large additional number of looms have been set on in the last two months, and orders for both home tradeand export have increased.  Prospects for machinery employmentgenerally are more encouraging.  In the woollen section alsomore orders are being received, and some sections are wellemployed.  In the hosiery trade there is fair activity, andit Is believed recent cold weather will have a distinctlybeneficial effect on future orders.     &quot;Higher costs in this country, particularly wages which remain at 101 over pre-war, are a severe handicap, and givegreat advantage to foreign competitors in an industry liketextiles where In spinning, for instance, production ispositive and dependent on spindle speed.&quot;ARTIFICIAL SILK.     MR. ADDISON did not think there was anything to add tohis brief report to the Advisory Coufecil last month.  the artificial silk section might still be regarded as the bright
ARTIFICIAL SILK (CONTD,)spot in the textile trade, and, so far as one oorild tell,the outlook remained not unsatisfactory.  Demand stillexceeded the available supply, snd the chief ground of complaint on the part of consumers was that they still had tbe rationed to a certain extent.  However, that positionwould probably change during the next twelve months, because some of the newcomers into the industry ought by then to be making their weight felt.CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES.     MR. C.A. HILL reported that business In the home ;chemical trade had slackened off towards the end of november and during December, - as one would expect it to do at thattime of the year, - otherwise the last quarter of theyear showed a steady improvement in trade.  The exporttrade had maintained Its improvement, and some abatementhad occurred In the intense competition from which theindustry had been suffering, consequent, it was believed,on an increased demand for British products.     In regard to prices, British makers of  heavychemicals had announced reductions for the New Year inthe prices of several of their products, such as bleachingpowder, soda ash, caustic soda and sodium hyposulphite.FOOD INDUSTRIES.     SIR STANLEY MACHIN believed that the heavy indebtednesscaused by the strike of 1926,  and its effect on theconsumption of the population, were being reduced andcleared off, and that an increased demand in the food tradesmight be reasonably expected.   The overseas  markets,  also,certainly showed signs of encouragement.   Sir S. Machin^own company, which might be taken as an example of the wholetrade, had more business on its books than it had had formany years, and its representatives in most  markets reportedthat they expected to do an increased trade  during thecoming year.GENERAL TRADE.     LORD GAINFORD washable  to  confirm,  from the reportsthat had been received by the Federation of  BritishIndustries,  almost everything that had been  said at  the
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD).Council,  The Federation did not anticipate a boom this year,but their view was quite different from that expressed bytheir Chairman at the beginning of last year, arid perhaps atthe begjmzing of the year before.  They felt, from theInformation they received, that production in this country ?/assteadily increasing;  and although the trade barometer wasnot going up very rapidly, still it showed a steady rise.  an industrial activity could be seen in the  home market whichwas considerably greater than TO had seen before.  The export industries, also, appeared at the moment to be more successful with their foreign competitors than they had beena few months ago, and there existed, as had already been mentioned, a tendency for wages on the Continent to rise, anda possible alteration of hours, which might help us in ourcompetition with the foreigner.     To take the principal Industries  separately, - althoughthe production of pig iron from one point of view wasdisappointing, yet it was on a higher  level than before thecoal stoppage.  The  steel trade appeared to be somewhatpatchy, and while some works had been  very busy even duringthe holidays, and overtime had been paid, oth9r works hadentirely  stopped during  the holidays.  The tin plate markethad maintained its recent increase, although prices wereunchanged.  Steam coals  had been in fair demand and the saleof industrial and domestic fuels had Increased.  Theimprovement in the export trade had, also, been well maintained.  Nevertheless, most of the coal producers were still losing money.     Sales of cotton cloth for India had been fair, and encouraging advices had  been received  from China.  In the near east  o-nd on the Continent, honever, our cotton trade had been restricted.  The tons of the new wool  market had been firm;and increased activity was reported, though in worstedsrather  than woollens.  Boot and shoe manufacturers had beenfully occupied, partly owing to seasonal  reasons and partly to a possible increase in selling prices during the year inconsequence of higher values of leather.     In the chemical industry the outlook was better than ithad been  for some time past*  In the pottery trade there wasa  slowing-up with the completion of Christmas orders.  export business was continuing  to be rather better than had been anticipated.  In engineering there was but. little change;  inthe Clyde area the shipyards continued to be active, andtextile machinery business with the Far East and Rxxssiashowed  signs of improving, whilst some improvement was  also reported  In the machine  tool section.  Employment in the motor industry  continued to improve.     MR. GILBERT VYLE observed that,  on the  subject of tradein general, one could hardly say that the  year that had recently closed had borne out the promise  of its  early
CONFIDENTIAL.GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.)months;  &quot;but, as far as one could see, the promise of theearly months of 1927 still existed in 1928.  It was onthat account, he thought, that we could still look forward with some confidence to improved conditions of trade.  Itwas difficult to say exactly why 1927 failed to fulfil morecompletely our anticipations.  The conditions today seemedmuch the same as they had been 12 months ago, but traderswere not pessimistic;  they rsere hopeful that things would turn out a little differently this year.     The general reports from the country seemed to confirm that things were not going back;  there was a- slightimprovement, and whatever improvement was made was being held, and steady business was going on.  In many partssome anxiety existed as to new orders coming in, but onthe average one could say that improjrement was being maintained, and there was considerable confidence for thefuture.     SIR STANLEY I.IACHIN said that his information confirmed the views of Mr. Vyle that the trading results of the past year were on the whole unsatisfactory.  Not only, however,had it been exceedingly difficult to keep up the normal trade turnover, but  even the business that had been donehad very often been done without a reasonable margin of profit.  Mr. Bond had referred (see Section on Iron andSteel) to free imports in connexion with his particular industry.  It might perhajs  be of interest to the Councilto hear that a leading American industrialist, in giving an address a fortnight ago on the industrial conditions inEngland as compared with those of America, started with theplea that America had the great advantage of a protectedhome market.  It was of some interest to know the view taken in America on that metter.     In connection with the fviture, Sir S. Machin thoughtthat the more optimistic outlook was to some extentjustified.  It was gratifying to hear of the large increasein the bankers&apos; clearances, but this particular item wasscarcely a true barometer of the state of trade in thecountry.  As we all knew, the Stock Exchange had had a verybusy year, and that naturally  enormously increased thebankers1 clearances.  The vastly improved outlook as between employers and employed was a factor which inspired moreconfidence, and was undoubtedly a very important one.      MR. HAYHURST wrote:-      &quot;The past month has  been satisfactory from a tradingstandpoint.   Sales have been of the  usual  character,  and ICO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY.
                   GENERAL TRADE  (CONTD.)              Co-operative Wholesale Society.(Contd.)am pleased to say we have had no untoward incident to cope with, notwithstanding the large orders placed with us in viewof the Christmas season.  On all  sides I have reports of increased trade,     &quot;Grocery and Provisions.  Two recent reductions in pricehave created  an easy tone in Danish butter.  Australian andNew Zealand butter, at present prices, have been attractive.Towards the end of the month the market closed firmer.September matured Canadian cheese continues to command itsprice, with diminishing stocks.  Lancashire cheese, withdecreased milk production is, speaking generally, somewhatscarce.  In flour and wheat the market of late has practicallybeen unchanged.  Recent large arrivals of Continental bacon and hams met witn good demand, resulting in a much steadiertone;  prices generally were unchanged.  Tho outlook,however,for Irish and Danish Indicates shortened supplies, and nodoubt higher prices will be the vogue.  American hascontinued in light supply, which, however, has been amplefor the lessened request for this class of meat.     &quot;The production of foodstuffs in the various factorieshas been satisfactory from practically every standpoint.     &quot;Drapery, Woollens and Furniture:    In each section the sales during the past month have been of a satisfactorycharacter, and I am not aware of any item calling for spe cialobservation on my part.  Salesmen speak optimistically of1928.     &quot;Tea.  The last fortnight of December saw no Tea        ;auctions on the home market, sellers withdrawing all theirlists until the New Year.  The figures of stock shew moretea in bond than twelve months ago.  This does not actuallymean more supplies, but this year there has been moreshipping space, and imports are ahead of last year.  Therewill be less tea to come forward from the East.  The shortage in the Northern India crop - which is half the worldrssupplies, &quot; is now put at from 9 million lbs. to 28 millionlbs,, and an acute position is likely to arise between now and April,  The demand for tea continues from almost every country in increasing quantities,     &quot;Cocoa.  The first weeks of December saw a drop in WestAfrica cocoa prices at home, and this was fc llowed by a fallin the Gold Coast and in Nigeria.  This position was said tohave been forced by speculators at home who were booking&quot;forward deliveries&quot; at figures below the first cost on theCoast,  orders seemed to have been booked to  an appreciable extent, and to that extent orders were removed from tho coast and in turn broke the combine (i.e. the Gold Coast) prices.But this last week has seen a rally on the Coast and prices
         GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.)Co-operative wnolesale Society (Contd.)are quickly hardeninc.  The home orders which were booked forforward deliveries will have to be fulfilled, so that a furtherhardening on the Ccast is expected - followed by a general risein the price position at home.  The home trade in chocolateseemed to have reached a record output, except for parts of lancashire and Yorkshire which are suffering from the oottondepression.&quot;GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING.     MR. HOLLAND MARTIN said that some improvement in tradewas Indicated in the Clearing House figures for the year,particularly in the country cheque clearings, where therehad been a very steady Increase after the first quarter overthe corresponding figures for 1926.  That again was reflected in the provincial clearings, where there had been -several large increases In various portions of the country.  The total increase in the provincial clearings over 1926 for the last quarter of the year had been 9%%, which vvas quite satisfactory.     Generally one found, except in the basic industries,a feeling of hope that this year would be better than last,and the prospects certainly appeared to be brighter thanthey had been for some time.     MR. CURRIE reported that a large amount of money had, as usual, been borrowed by the discount market from the Bankof England over the end of the year.  This had made money for the time being very easy; but, when the bank had beenrepaid, the available margin was not likely to be great.Meanwhile the three months bill rate had tended to decline;and the export of gold from the United States had encourageda belief in some quarters that the bank of England ratemight be reduced in the not distant future.     During December an optimistic feeling had prevailedon the Stock Exchange.  The applications for the new issueof Treasury Bonds had been on a large scale, and the listfor fresh subscriptions was closed after two days.Gilt-edged securities generally had been firm and had shown rises in all cases.  The increase In the totals ofthe Bankers&apos; Clearing House had been referred to byMr. Holland Martin.  Mr. Currie desired to add only that,so far as it went, this was an encouraging feature.
I4(1SNIPPING.     MR. ALEXANDER SHAW pointed out that shipping freightsremained stagnant; there had been only a fractional increase.Taking the 1920 figure as 100, the November, 1927, figure was27.75, and the October, 1927, figure 27.34.   Perhaps it was more Interenting to take the 1913, pre-war, figure a3 100.In November 1927 the comparable figure was 118.6, while inOotober it was 116.8.   Of course, the moral of thesefigures was that freights had not risen sinoe pre-war days to nearly the same extent as the cost of running ships.     Mr. Shaw had no new figures with regard to tonnage under construction, but it had been gathered that, since thebeginning of October up to the present, orders had beenplaced by British owners for shipping of about 350,000 dead-weight tons.   The coal export figures had already beengiven to the Council in one form, and Mr. Shaw desired torefer to them in another.   The November and October figuresof weight of coal exported from the United Kingdom were atthe rate of about 50 million tons a year.   The Chamber ofShipping, however, regarded 60 million  tons a year as afair average, and the exports were still considerably below that.   The prioe of north country special Durham bunkercoal in November remained at the very low figure of 15/3d,as compared with 17/3d. in January 1927.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.     SIR JOSIAH STAMP observed that about the beginning ofNovember, when estimates were to be prepared, It had looked as though the London Midland and 3cottlsft Railway wouldfinish the year approximately on a level with the figuresof 1925; but traffio fell away rather badly towards the aid of November, mainly in the matter of coal.   It was verydifficult to give any olecr lead as to railway prospects inthe immediate future, because so many good plus figures werebeing cancelled by minus figures.  Live stock from Ireland,for instance, showed a very disappointing figure, and it was quite impossible to say -that there was any strong tendency in any direotion.     The year certainly finished in rather a disappointingway, as far aa could be tested by this Railway Company^traffio; but, judging by the feeling of the different districts,there was now much the same kind of New Year optimism that had been shown the last four or five years on the turn of theyear, and there was perhaps just about as  much basis for it.MR, R, H. Hill handed in the following statement:-     &quot;7/e now have the railway reoelpts for 51 weeks oflast year, and can compare them with a similar period in 1925.   Reoeipts from general merchandise have
G0HFIDE1ITIAL.RAILWAY TRAFFIC (CONTD.)exceeded those of 1925 by  4,400,000, and coal accountedfor a further increase of  2,000,000.   Cn the other hand,Passenger receipts were less than in 1925 by about 5,140,000 so that the net increase was about  1,260,000.December was a comparatively favourable month, so far as general merchandise vrae concerned, yielding receiptsapproaching half a million sterling in excess of thoseof December 1925.     :sThe aggregate tonnage of freight conveyed during thefirst 10 months of the year was 9,000,000 tons, or 3.4  inexcess of that for 1925, coal wjounting for 6,000,000 tonsof this.   Other heavy traffics which increased consider-ably over the tonnages for the corresponding 10 months o f1925 wore iron and steel, which showed an increase of over2,400,COO tons, or nearly 18$, and ironstone aud iron orewith an increase of over 1,000,000 tons, or 12j2.&quot;EMPLOYMENT.     MR. PHILLIPS said that the unemployment figures inthe latter part of the year had been somewhat disappointingThe increase usual in the Autumn had continued to a later date than usual, and the reduction which was anticipatedouch year in the weeks before Christmas did not begin untilthe second week of December.   In the three weeks up to19th December there had been a- fall of 45,000, and thefigure on the 19th December was 1,099,900.   This total was rather less than the corresponding figure for 1924,and much less than the corresponding figure for any otheryear since 1920.   It might be of interest also to note that the average weekly live register for the year 1927was 1,112,000, whilst for the previous years since 1920the lowest figure had been in 1924, when It was 1,131,000,that this year had shown a figure about 20,000 less thanthe lowest previoiTS figure since 1920.     THE PRESIDENT observed that, as Mr. Phillips had explained at a previous meeting, the unemployment figuregave only a partial picture.   In order to gat a more complete one, due allowance would have to be made for thenet. number of people absorbed into employmoat.CONDITIONS IN AUSTRALIA.     A note was received from MR. S iVi!X):ERS.01T to thefollowing effect:-     Better weather has occurred in the pastoral and agricultural districts of Queensland and New South 7/ales.
GOHProElITIAL.CONDITIONS IN AUSTRALIA. (C ONTD.).Good rainfalls were experienced on the coasts, and goodrains were widespread over the interior, though decreasingto far westward.   Conditions over the eastern coastlineand the Pacific slope have been improving for some timeand a good season is expected there, whilst pastoralprospects are muoh brighter over the interior, andindications point to improvement gradually extending to  the remainder of the dry areas.     In South Australia there have also been useful thoughlight rains, but the harvest will hardly  be up to theaverage, and stock in the far northern Interior have beenlosing condition.  The Victorian harvest will also be belowthe average, though here - as in other States - the crops are yielding better than was at first anticipated.  In thenorth-east the season has turned out particularly well,and in Tasmania the good rain in early December has cora-pletely changed the outlook, and cereals and pastures have greatly improved.INDIAN TRADE.     MR. LINDSAY said that the chief point of interestthis month as regards. India arose from the currency andfinancial situation.   The remittances due to this country during the current financial year had been estimated bythe Finance Member at  35jg- million, and up to the end ofNovember he had made very little progress in sending that amount home .   In the exchange market he was always trying to hold out for l/6d, the market would rarely give himmore than 1/5 3l/32d, and that odd 1/32 seemed to havebeen rather a stumbling block.   Ke had met the situation by standing out of the market almost completely for one week, with  the result that he had got l/Gd ever since, andwas now in the position of having remitted nearly  28millions out of the  35-^.     This year the crop outlook was distinctly good.   Asa result, larger amounts of currency were necessary to finance the crops, the bank rate was pushed up in Decemberfrom 5  to 6$, and again from 6$ to 7 , and the ImperialBank of India had had to make use of the provisions underwhich it was entitled to borrow additional currency fromthe Government at 6j&apos;i.   It had already taken 4 crores atthis rate, and there was a balance of 8 crores left whichit might take at a rate of 7Ji.   The Bombay cotton cropshowed an advance over last year of 15% in acreage andof 30^ in yield.   That was a very surprising result con-sidering that last August Bombay was complaining of floods.It showed the extraordinary vitality of Indian agriculturethat the whole of the oottcm sowings in many parts of bombay had been literally washed away;   those areas had had to be re-sown, and the re-sowings were so successful
INDIAN TRADE (CONTD.)that the crop  output  this year had  increased  by 30/3.   Theother crop3 were also in a  satisfactory  position.   Rice  wasabout normal at 30 million  tons.  It  was too  early yet tosay much about wheat,  but the oil seeds  and sugarcane  cropsshowed a distinct advance over the  previous year.     Burma rice had been suffering  rather severely from  thecompetition of Italian and  Spanish  rice.  India,  it was  true,was making up  a certain amount of the lost ground,  becauseItaly and Spain were  buying Burma rice to feed  themselveswhile they exported their own rice.   So  far indeed  she has notin fact, lost  very much ground, but it had to be admitted that the Spanish and  Italian rice were distinctly  betterthan her own,  and vrere  accordingly receiving  encouragement in continental markets which the Indian  product  did not get.As a counter blast, the German rice importers - who hadhandled Burma  rice in the past and did not want to  changeover to the Italian and Spanish, - had organised propaganda in Germany for the consumption of Burma  rice, and naturallythe Indian interests were doing all they could  to help thatpropaganda by  films and exhibits at German exhibitions andso on.     In regard to her exports of pig  iron India had beenthreatened in  three distinct markets,  -  Japan,  America and australia.  The Japanese proposed to  put a heavy duty  on pigiron (which cams almost entirely from India)  in retaliationfor the recent increase in her duties on cotton yarns,although no discriminating duty had been put  on against japan as had been recommended.  However,  the duty on pig ironhad not yet been imposed and just possibly It night not  be.America had talked of  increasing the  dut;/ on  Indian pig  ironas a result of differences between export  and local consump-ticn prices.   However,  those prices had  now gone againstAmerica by $2  a ton and therefore there was no  question  nowof that duty coming on.  Australia thought of putting a  dutyon Indian pig  Iron because the Indian exchange  was  now l/6dinstead of being 2/-  (the old official rate)  -  but  there also,on consideration of the facts of the  case, it had beenagreed not to  impose  the additional duty.  India was,however, more  than threatened with, she was suffering from,an  increased duty on magnesite in America, apparentlydesigned to protect American supplies, and against  that dutythere was understood to be no appeal.  India had, therefore,to be very much cn the  look-out as to the  treatment of evenher raw produce in the tariff policies of foreign countries.As to manufactured goods, the United Kingdom was the onlycountry in which she could sell them.  Further,  buyingprospects were distinctly good.   India&apos;s  imports had increased quite considerably during 1927 as compared with theyear before.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     Fir. HOSE -wrote;- &quot;The first official estimates of thefine cereal crops in Argentina were published on 17th december last, and placed the probable production of wheat at
6,530,000 tons, against 6,010,000 tons last season; that oflinseed at 2,160,000 tons, against 1,755,000 tons; and that  of oats at 940,000 tons, against 952,000.  Cable advices sincereceived from  the Republic Indicate that good progress is beingmade with the harvest.  Reports of the threshing operationsconfirm that the yield will be heavy and of good quality in  thegreater part of the agricultural zones, the yield of wheat,except in the  southern districts, promising to be as much as30 per cent, more per acre than last year.  There seems nodoubt that the total wheat shipments will show an increase,while maize sowings may constitute a record.    &apos;;Official  statistics of Argentine foreign trade continueto reflect the remarkable expansion in the exports during 1927,although shipments naturally showed a tendency to contracttowards the latter part of the year, pending the harvesting  ofthe new crops.  The latest available figures show that the total value of exports for tho first ten months of the current year was  857,769,000 (gold), as compared with  678,045,000 in thecorresponding period of 1926, while imports amounted to 696,334,000w(gold), against  690,764,000.  The visible surplusof exports for the period was thus as much as  161,435,000 &quot;(gold)against an excess of imports of  12,719,000 In the correspondingperiod of 1926, and there is little doubt that the final figuresfor last year will show a favourable balance of merchandisetrade ranking among the highest recorded in the history of theRepublic.     &quot;In Uruguay, importers of textiles report that stocks havediminished considerably, and that the situation is steadilyImproving.  Sales are more active, and collections are beingmade with greater freedom.  Satisfactory progress is being madewith the harvest, and. it is generally anticipated that the yield of wheat will be one of the largest the country has experienced.    &quot;Sales of Chilean nitrate of soda continue to be made on asatisfactory scale, and the total amount disposed of since theintroduction of free selling exceeds 2,625,000 metric tons,including 68,000 metric tons disposed of for shipment after July,1928.  The great improvement in the demand for Chilean nitratewhich has occurred In recent months has been due largely to thereduction in prices, but It is of interest to note that a contributory cause is stated to be that consumers, after having had an opportunity in the past few seasons of comparing in actualuse the relative qualities of synthetic and Chilean nitrate,  haveshown a definite preference for the latter, when offered on a competitive basis.  Over sixty ofieinas are at present inoperation in Chile, while more are preparing to re-open,  and estimates point to a monthly production of some  250,000 tonsbecoming possible In the early future.  The outlook, however,appears uncertain, owing to the fact that considerable difficultymay be experienced in securing labour, once the  present stocks ofcaliche are exhausted and output becomes  entirely dependent uponfresh extraction.  Meanwhile, a slightly increased movement in trade is reported in the northern districts, although no marked improvement has occurred in the general commercial situation.
     &quot;In my last report to the Council,  I mentioned thatarrangements were being made for the Issue  in New York of afurther loan on behalf of the Peruvian Government.  The issue which v/as for an amount of $50,000,000,  in  the form of 6 percent. External Sinking Fund Gold Bonds,  offered at the price of91*- per cent., was successfully floated  on  21st December last.The prospectus stated that the proceeds  of  the Issue would be devoted primarily to the retirement of external secured loansor obligations of the Republic, on which the service charges were comparatively high.  The balance would be utilised for the repayment of certain short-term Indebtedness; the establishmentof a gold exchange fund in connection v/ith  the stabilisation of Peruvian currency;  the payment of the Republic&apos;s share ofthe capital of the Mortgage Bank of Peru, shortly to be created;t&apos;,:e construction and Improvement of dock and shipping facilities in the harbour of Callao; and the construction of public works.Curing the course of December, an improvement occurred in theexchange value of Peruvian currency, possibly owing to thesentimental effect of the flotation of the  loan, the premium on sterling being reduced from &apos;-4f per cent, in the early days ofthe month, to 2if per cent, on the 14th.  A re-action has sinceensued, the quotation being now 23^ per  cent., but no announce-ment has as yet been made as to the level at which efforts willbe made to effect stabilisation.  Meanwhile, business in theImport markets  in Peru has been quiet, although trade in theInterior is stated to be satisfactory.     &quot;The economic situation in Mexico remains extremelydifficult, but it would appear that a feeling of increasedoptimism is developing in commercial circles.  This change maybe attributed chiefly to evidences of an improvement havingrecently occurred in relations between the United States andMexico, which should make further progress as a result of thepassage through the Mexican Congress of  legislation amendingArticles 14 and 15 of the Constitution Act of 1917, which hadthe effect of restricting the rights of  petroleum companiesholding concessions secured before the passing of the Act.  APan-American conference is due to open at Havana this month, andthe effect of the slackening of tension  in Mexican-american relations will no doubt be reflected in  the course of proceed-ings there.     &quot;in general, commercial conditions  in Brazil have beenquiet during the past month, although an improvement is expected in some quarters during the early months of 1928. The movementof imported textiles in the Rio de Janeiro market is limited,although not altogether unsatisfactory.  Latest returns to hand of Brazilian foreign trade cover the first eight months of 1927,and show that imports amounted in value  to the equivalent of 52,157,000, as compared with  52,833,000 in the correspondingp-.period of 1926.  Exports totalled  52,781,000,  against 60,469,000, so that the surplus of visible exports was only 624,000, as against  7,636,000.     &quot;Exports of coffee during the first eight  months of lastyear were valued at  30,815,000, a reduction of  8,549,000,  ascompared with those during the corresponding period of 1926.
The reduction is attributable to the decline in prices of coffee, for Jt is to be noted that the number of bags shippedduring the period in 1927 v/as 9,060,000, representing anincrease of 522,000 bags.  Cable advices recently receivedfrom Rio de Janeiro state that the sanction of the Presidentof Brazil has been given to a resolution passed by Congress,which authorises the Federal Government to regulate trade incoffee between the various States of Brazil and betweenBrazilian and foreign ports by the establishment of restric-tions on that traffic.  The measure v/as apparently necessitated by the failure of the States of Minas Geraes and Rio deJaneiro to fulfil the letter of their agreement in regard toentries into the Port of Rio de Janeiro, and its passing into law should enhance the effect of the regulations for the saleof coffee under the control of the Convention set up in thelatter half of last year.     &quot;Considerable uncertainty Is expressed in Venezuela inregard to the prospects of an improvement in the commercialsituation.  In fact, no general recovery is anticipated untilthe middle of 1928, by which time, provided the outlook forthe next harvest is good, a return to normal conditions shouldtake place.  There have not been many failures, but the creditsituation is difficult.     &quot;in regard to the situation in the other CentralAmerican countries, no change of importance has boen reportedsince the date of my last Report to the Council.&quot;

Statement made at the meeting of the Advisory Committeeto the Department of Overseas Trade held on Wednesday,the 14th December, 1927, regarding the export tradeposition.MR. WOODCOCK  (chemical trade) said that on the whole a general improvement had In the last six months been evidenced, particularlyin the heavy  chemicals, though less so in the fine chemical  trade.The dyestuffs trade was practically stationary.   A good exporttrade-: was being conducted in tar products, particularly in creosoteand pitch.MR. BRUCE- GARDNER (iron and steel) stated that the exports of Ironand steel in November amounted to 399,000 tons, which was the highestfigure reached since May, when 422,000 tons were exported.     Unfortunately, we still suffered from large imports, whichwero 72,000 tons higher per month than in 1925 and 100,000 tonshigher than pre-war.   The galvanised sheet section of the tradewas experiencing a quiet period and the financial difficultieswhich had arisen in India were mainly responsible for the position.He understood that the stocks in India at the present time totalledfrom 25,000 to 30,000 tons, and it was not expected that any important change would occur until February.   The tin plate tradewas very quiet indeed, although a little better than recently.The trade had agreed to curtail output and close down for a  fewweeks.   While the heavy iron and steel trade was not in a happyposition, the situation in Germany might materially affect theindustry.MR. HI CHENS (shipbuilding) stated that the ship-building trade wasin a depressed condition, though tnere were more orders.   In hisopinion there was not enough work to go round owing to the increasein the number of shipbuilding slips during the war.   Another point was that in the 80&apos;s of the last century Great Britain used  tobuild over 80 per cent, of the ships of the world, now we arebuilding 40/50 per cent. only.     The railway carriage and wagon trade v/as rather better  off, butprices were cut.MR. LEE  (cotton spinning) could not offer an encouraging report inrelation to cotton textiles, particularly the bread and buttertrades, which were on short time and were losing money.   It wasimpossible to produce at the same cost as our competitors owing tcour shorter hours and higher wages.   He expressed the opinionthat Lancashire would only secure work when there was sufficientdemand to keep all the world1a spindles going.   The fine trade,such as dress goods, etc. had done much better.     In reply to Mr. Hacking, Mr. Lee stated that he thought thatit was possible to turn over the machinery to making finer counts,but that as regards hereditary skill and climatic advantages hethought we now had no pull.   The skill of our competitors wasequal to ours while the degree of humidification could easily bearranged.   In fact, in relation to skill he thought that inweaving the French were better than the Lancashire operatives.What was important, however, was that tho countries which had signed the Washington Convention were not observing it.   It wasnot only a question of wages but that of hours, and our competitorswere working  a 60 hour week in many cases and in addition employingwomen and children on night shifts.Mr. PARKER/
In/                           -2-  MR.  PARKER (boots and shoes) said&apos;that in his trade our  competitors were working longer hours for lower wages.    As*  regards exports, progress was upward and we were slowly recovering  trade.    A serious matter which had arisen recently, however,  was  the shortage of raw material.    The United States was a  large buyer of hides from the Argentine at high prices, and  he  understood that these hides were being exported to Russia.  To-day our exports to the United States of America of hides  and  dressed leather had shown a material increase over any  previous year.   During the first eleven months of 1925  98,000 cwts. of dressed leather were exported to the United  States as against 180,000 cwts. in the corresponding period  of 1927.  MR.  JOHNSTON (pottery) reported that a change had come over  the  position in the pottery trade.   Since June last, Germany,  France, Czechoslovakia and Holland were exporting to this  country earthenware at 40-50 per cent, below the price at which  British manufacturers could produce.   He had had reports from  Australia and South Africa that certain semi-porcelain goods  were being imported from Holland at 50 per cent, under the  prices he was in a position tc quote, and it was interesting  to note that a Dutch firm had complained that they had to pay   2.4.0d. a week in wages, while the Belgians and Germans only  paid 35/-.  In this country our manufacturers had to pay no  less than  4.       As regards sanitary earthenware, before the war the  business was almost entirely in the hands of British manufacturers,  but  since the war the Dutc-i were able to send goods into this  country at 30 per cent, under British cost.   The situation  was  so serious that the only remedy appeared to be in an allround  reduction in wages of  20%.  MR.  ROWLAND (agricultural machinery) reported that in the open  market they could meet competition from the United States in  the  Argentine and South Africa, but the prevailing tariffs  everywhere made business difficult.   In connection with Australia  he referred to the pressure which was brought to bear upon local  bodies to purchase Australian-made goods to the exclusion of  British.   He hoped that the Department would bear this important  question in mind when any opportunity offered with regard to the  Australian tariff and also the South African tariff.  Mr. Hacking  replied that this matter was constantly before the Department,  Lnough naturally the position was rather a delicate one.  MR.  VYLE (hardware and metals) was able to discern some little  encouragement from the November trade returns.  Speaking broadly,  trade was anything but satisfactory, but was an improvement on  what had gone before.   He stated that at a later meeting of the  Committee he hoped to draw attention to the discrepancies which  existed in freights from the United Kingdom ports as compared with  continental.   He explained that it was possible to ship goods from  Hamburg and Antwerp at a rate of 15/- per ton, whereas goods of  the  same classification on the same boat tvhen shipped from the  &apos;  United Kingdom ports were charged 60/- to 70/- per ton.   In  consequence of tnis, shippers were often compelled to send goods  from this country across to Antwerp with a view to avoiding  higher  freight charges.   This matter was, however, being examined  by a small committee and their conclusions would be put before  the  Department at a later date.
     Jjj&apos;r IDEKTIAL.    &apos;                            -3         In general,  he thought that  owing to  the  growth of manufacture     in what had hitherto  been importing  countries,  it might be    necessary for manufacturers here  to  concentrate  on  special     quality and special design, though this would  inevitably result     in a reduction of volume of trade.    MR. EMS LEY  (worsted industry) mentioned that for the ten months    pf the year as compared with 1925 we retained  80,000,000 lbs.    more wool.   He pointed out that  the export of  tops  were greater     by 10,000,000 lbs. having Increased  from 25 to  35 million pounds.     The export  of yarns had advanced  to  56,003,000  lbs.  frcm     43,000,000 lbs. but the exports of the finished, article were down     by 13,000,000 square  yards, while  imports  had  increased by  5,000,000     square yards.   The decrease of exports was due  to  some extent to    the  confusion in  the  Far East.         Speaking generally, he thought  that we were holding cur o?m    in the better class of trade and  were even able, in spite of the    high tariff barrier,  to export cloth to America.    In the lower    grade cloths we were  finding it difficult  to maintain our position    but in any case we were not importing such quantities of the    inferior quality  cloth as we did  before the war.         Considerable difficulty had  arisen in his  trade over the    v/ages question and he emphasised  the necessity for  a reduction in    the cost of living.    MR. DODWELL (China merchant trade) speaking of  the  Chinese  trade,     said that his firm had done better this year than last, though     this only meant they  had not lost  so much  money.    There appeared    to be a gradual improvement in trade.   The slight  improvement he    had mentioned did not extend to the  cotton piece goods trade.    COLONEL PEEL (export  credits) reported that the  character and scope     of the scheme had changed considerably during  the past year.   The    outstanding feature of the new scheme was  the  floating contract,    by which risk could be insured without the bills having to  be    separately guaranteed.   It was interesting also to note that the     Committee over which  he presided  did not find  it necessary  to    refuse so high a  pruportiori cf applications that were received.     The  chief point about the Government scheme was  that, in the case     of a loss, payment was made on the due date and  it  was not  necessary    for the assured to wait until varit.ua conditions had been fulfilled.     The  scheme was, however, still in the nature of  an  experiment, and     he could not make any prophecy at  to its ultimate effect.   The    danger was  that manufacturers would  select risks against the    Department, but the remedy for this  was that firms  should be     invited to insure the whole of their risks, the  good with the    bad so far as it  fell within the  scheme.   As  he had reported, the    volume of business that was being undertaken showed a considerable     increase.   This  was  making possible reductions  in  the rates     charged, which would  itself stimulate further  business.
