      At a recent meeting of the Cabinet I mentioned my proposal to introduce a Bill to amend tho Children Act, 1908,and I think my colleagues may wish to have a brief sketch ofthe object and scope of this Bill.      The Children Act, 1908, v&apos;hich was popularly kno-n as theChildren&apos;s Charter, v/as a notable attempt to bring together anumber of scattered provisions in regard to the protection ofneglected children and the treatment of young offenders.   Itstrengthened the law in many directions and introduced some newfeatures, especially the system of Juvenile Courts.   Sincothen considerable progress has been made in tho methods ofdealing with this problem and the time has come for reviewing the Childron Act in the light of the experience which has been gained.   Different parts of the field have been covered by theenquirioo of three Departmental Committees which have been heldin the last few years, and tho main object of the Bill is togive effect to recommendations made by these Committees.      (l) The Child Adoption Committee issued three reports.The first two dealt with the question of adoption and 3.ffecthas already been given to its recommendations in the Adoptionof Children Act, 1926.   The third report dealt with (a) baby-farming, and (b) tho inspection of voluntary homes for poorchildren.      As regards (a), the Committee recommended certain amendments of Part I of the Children Act, 1908, which relates to the protection of infant life.   The main proposal is that   (This document is the property of His Britannic Majestyrs Government)SECRET.CP.5 (28)                                                  \ &apos;h                            C A 3 I IT E T.                            CHILDREN BILL.                   Memorandum by tho Home Secretary.
the local Education Authority instead of the Guardians should in future administer the lav;.   I understand that the Ilinisterof Hoalth, who is the Central Authority in respect of thisPart of the Act, is in agreement with the recommendations.      As regards (b) the proposal of the Committoe is that allHomes for the maintenance of poor children which are supportedwholly or partly by voluntary contributions should be registered and that the existing powers of inspection ventedin the Secretary of State should be strengthened.      (2) Another Committee which reported at the end of1925 considered the question of sexual offences against young people.    It made two groups of recommendations.   The first group contained proposals for amending the law and procedure of Courts in the trial of offences of this character.   Theproblem is admittedly a difficult one and the expediency of several  of the recommendations Is open to doubt.   I have asked the Lord Chief Justice for his opinion before deciding to make  any changes in the law.      The second group of recommendations deals with the care and protection of young persons in respect of whom sexualoffences have been committed or who are falling into badassociations.   These are generally acceptable and will be covered by the proposed Bill.      (3) The Third Committee enquired into the whole questionof the treatment of young offenders and neglected children and young persons.   Part of the report of the Committee whichrefers to offenders between 17 and 21 is beyond the scope ofthe Children Act and is being considered separately.   Host ofthe other recommendations, which relate to younger persons andwhich appear to me to be based on sound principles, are beingincorporated in the new Bill.   It is unnecessary for me to mention those recommendations in detail, but the following areamong the moro important changes:-
-3-55   (a) Provision will bo made for developing the Juvenile        Courts further on exioting lines.  Tho constitution        of such Courts will be subject to rules to be made        by tho Lord Chancellor and the procedure will be        simplified.   (b) For the purposes of the Juvenile Courts and for        other purposes in the Children Act a young person        will be defined as under the age of 17 instead of        under 16 as at present.   (c) Provision v/ill be made for the better examination        and observation of young offenders during remand.   (d) A number of changes will be made in the provisions        regarding Industrial and Reformatory Schools so        as to give greater facilities for th9 admirable work        which these schools are doing.   (e) Capital punishment will be abolished under 18.        This only gives legislative effect to what has been        the practice for many years.   (f) The provisions of the Children Act for the welfaro        of neglected children will bo strengthened and        extended.      In view of strong representations which have boenmade to me about the evils of betting among young personsI propose to include a clause in tho Bill to deal with thismatter.      Opportunity will also be taken of including a numberof minor amendments of the Children Act which experienceof its administration has shewn to be necessary.      1 believe that public interest in child welfare inthis country has never been keener than it is at present.There is evidence of widespread interest in the proposalswhich have been made by the Committees of Enquiry and theBill to give effect to them is likely to receive warm support from many quarters.W.J.H.16th January,  1928.
