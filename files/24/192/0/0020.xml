It will  beseen that, in spite of  an unexpected  saving of nearly  1,200,000 on the Post Officeestimates, we are still nearly  5 millions short of the minimum which  will enablethe Budget to be balanced without fresh taxation.

If the additional sum asked for by the Admiralty on  this account is provisionally excluded,pendiuj;- the report of the Cabinet Committee ou the whole question of Naval Oil Reserves, there would bea reduction as compared with 1927 of  350,000.  -
