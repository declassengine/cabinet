I think my colleagues may like to see In full  theletter to our Trade Commissioner In Nev? Zealand fromMr. Stewart, Minister of Finance, from which,1 I readextracts at a recent meeting of the Cabinet.                                    P.C-L.Board of Trade,  15th February, 1928.
Dominion of New Zealand,252                              Office of Minister of Finance,                                         WELLINGTON.                                          16. 12. 27.My Dear Beale,     As I understand you sail for England on Tuesday I wouldlike to express to you &quot;before you go my admiration for thesplendid work you have done during your first period of dutyin New Zealand as British Trade Conmlssioner.     When you arrived here last year I was delighted with the rapidity with which you grasped the situation and secured atonce the confidence not only of the trade representatives ofBritish Industry but of the commercial community as a whole.     Not only so but in my own work as Minister of Customsthere were many occasions on vhich your advice and assistanceproved of great value and I know from the Comptroller of customs that his department was equally indebted to you on matters of a technical nature and otherwise.     The work of a British Trade Commissioner req.uires theexercise of tact and judgment as although the people of NewZealand are ready and willing to help in every way to assistBritish trade it is always necessary to  keep in view theInterests of New Zealand local manufacturers and the dangerof preference to British manufacturers being abused or takenadvantage of.  As in the recent revision of the Tariff wehave extended the British preference in various directions i hope you will impress on British manufactimers that thoy mustnot rest on their oars or spare any effort to corepots both asto quality and price with their rivals in other countries.     I  do not suggest that in granting preference New Zealandhas done any more  than her plain duty and her obviousInterest dictates.  Because  when we consider the generous way
in which 3rd tain has, ever since this Dominion was founded,guarded and protected us by her navy, has year by year lentus millions for trie development of our lands and public works at cheaper rates than we could borrow elsewhere, has purchasedthe great bulk of our exports without any imposition of dutiesor other restrictions, has admitted us fully and freely tothe right of consultation in Imperial and foreign affairs, andhas borne without complaint or grumbling the almost intolerableburden of debt and taxation thrown on her by the Great War, wein this Dominion are filled with an overwhelming sense of grattitude and admiration,  le feel that although we are onlya small and distant unit we are fortunate beyond measure inenjoying the rights and privileges that belong to us as a constituent part of the Empire and that we share in some degreein the glories and splendour that characterise the positionof Great Britain in the great world of international affairs.     I have an abiding faith that she is not yet at the zenithof her greatness and that If the Dominions rise to a fullsense of their opportunities the Empire will grow from strength to strength to render still greater services to civilisationand humanity.     I hope therefore that when you return reinsplred by yourvisit to the Homeland, if times are propitious and we arestill in office I may have the pleasure of further co-cpera-tion with you in the cause we both have at heart.  As you know the last revision of the tariff was made at a time of depression and much that I would like to have done had toremain in abeyance for considerations of revenue and other factors.     Even if political fortunes should prove -unfavorable and you  find me a private citizen I shall even  then be glad torender you what  assistance I  can.
     Meanwhile I remember with great pleasure  our many  talksand your personal kindness and consideration and I  think you can report to your principals at Home with a sense  of dutywell done in New Zealand and with confidence that you can beof still further service to the Empire on your return.                          Believe me                             Yours very sincerely,                                (Sgd.) Wm.D.Stewart.
