CABINET.                  NOTE BY THE CHANCELLOU OK  EXCHEQUER.    I CIRCULATE  for the information of the Cabinet  opinions expressed by certainrepresentative business men whom I have consulted confidentially and separately in regard to the plan proposed in my memorandum CP. 8 (28), namely, Sir JosiahStamp. Lord Weir and Sir Arthur Duckham (with  Mr.  David Allan).                                                                   W  S  C    Treasury  Chambers, S.W. 1,         February 2, 1928.                                              Euxton Station, London, NAY. 1,My dear Chancellor,                                   January 24, 1928.    Your revised Scheme for Rating Relief.    1. The elimination of the Profits Tax removes my first objection.    2. The balancing of the finance of the scheme with a definite balance removesmv second difficulty, for  it  makes it unnecessarv to  assess  the  economic  andpolitical disadvantages of a deficit and balance it doubtfully against estimates ofeconomic advantages.  These advantages to the relieved trades may  be small intheir  influence on price  and  employment in many instances,  and they may be substantial and potent in others, but  in  either case they are clear  gain, and it is unnecessary to try to measure them exactly.    3. The new device of a flat National  Rate as a price of remission is equivalent in effect to a partial pooling of rates  and, therefore, almost entirely beneficent ininfluence.  It will serve  to break the vicious circle in the heavily rated areas andto prevent unnecessary economic migrations.    4. The undeserved difficulties into which existing concerns havejbeen plungedin heavily rated areas through disproportionate additions  to rates will  be relieved,and even if  the effect does not come out  in a price change for the whole trade, butstays in the increased profits, the effect is common justice.    5. The  petrol tax has  many incidental advantages and  fewer disadvantagesthan  most taxes.    ii. 1 am treating the  machinery of local grants and  reliefs as administrative and technical, and have no objection to raise to the scheme on economic linos.                                                     Yours sincerely,                                                              J. C. STAMP.The Right Hon. Winston Churchill, M.P..          The Treasury,               Whitehall, S.W. 1.ri7157 :
P.S. Although 1  prefer the old scheme, the new one  is better than nothing.                                                                    W. (Secret and Personal.)                       3, Adelphi Terrace, London, 11&apos;/&apos;. *2, My dear Chancellor,                                 February I,  V.)2S.     On  my return from the Continent on  Monday night, 1 found  Mr. Griggs note enclosing the latest variant on your scheme.   You  asked my opinion and 1 give it without- any elaboration.   I  think it suffers  in  comparison with  the original proposal, because  in place of a  clean-cut effort, it is  obviously a  compromise. Roses without thorns are an artificial breed.     Since I saw you last, 1 have given much thought to the broad  question  of the rate exemption  of the producer and I am now completely convinced that it  is the most useful contribution the Government  can make towards general welfare.  It is sound, sane, politically wise and economically right.     Now, as to  met hod, I am sorry to see the Profits Tax go and  its replacement by the National Rate,  tinder the old scheme, all producers were relieved of rates, and through the Profits Tax the more prosperous paid it back  according  to their degrees of prosperity.  Coder the new scheme, all are  relieved, but all  pay back one-third through  the inflexible  National  Rate.  On the basis  of principle, the new scheme may be fairer, but it is  not selective, as between  Domain  Long and Courtaulds.  Much or the relief will go where it is not needed and where  it  may not be passed on.  Also, for one or two quinquennial periods it is unfair as between an old and a new business dealing in the same product.    The Profits or Adjustment Tax was a  highly  ingenious scheme savouring of the ad hoc variety,  but  singularly  valuable in meeting existing conditions, selective in its beneficial  reactions, and while the name  conjured up possible Parliamentary troubles, the simple statement that  no one would be worse off seemed to  nie to meet all  the objections.  Moreover, its complete  demise in a few years of expanding trade would be obvious.  Why not debate the alternatives in the Cabinet?    Now, as to the rest of  the scheme, 1 am  too ignorant of Local Government finance to express an authoritative view on  the Block Grant  System.   All  that I am certain  of is that  there are  too many spending authorities and the control over them is at present quite inadequate, and that local suffrage can no longer be relied  on  for   sane  representation.    The  argument   that  loss of producers&apos; representatives  on  the spending  authority will worsen ^ihe situation  is utterly ridiculous.  In  Glasgow. I see Local  Government  waste on a big scale, but am quite powerless.  Any public protest coining from  a responsible citizen is at once met by the Socialist and Lib./Lab. team saying that- the protest is based on selfish self-interest.   The industrial reactions are absolutely neglected.    One  other detail, in examining General  Services, such as Gas and Electricity, how can  you secure  tho  passing on  of  the  benefits ?  1  quite  realise  the inconsistency of leaving out these Services, but  if they are in, and you also haveyour new scheme of a non-selective  National Rate, then 1  fear the net result tothe depressed producer will  be  so  small  as  to seriously  impair its effectiveness.The piecemeal method you quote for Agriculture  lends strength tinny argument.    1  hope you will excuse these very rough impressions.   Meanwhile,                                                     1 am, yours sincerely,                                                                     WEIR. The Right lion.  Winston S.

The Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill, C.H.,         His Majesty&apos;s Treasury,                       Whitehall, S.W. 1.* Not printed.                           Allington House,  130, Victoria Street, London, S.W.  I,My dear Chancellor,                     Friday, January 20, 102S.    Mr. Allan and I  have carefully studied the  latest Memoranda and make thefollowing remarks:     1.  Wo think that the fresh draft Memorandum to the Cabinet is an admirableand adequate exposition.  The particulars given  in Appendix &quot; C&apos;&quot;  (now blank)should be  made suilicicnt to demonstrate the measure of the benefit  to  productiveindustry if the burden of rates is lightened.   It would appear unquestionable thattho results will be influenced in a right direction.    Wo attach  some suggestions  for  Appendix &quot;C&quot;&quot; which  will perhaps  boconsidered with other material available.    2.  In  proviso (6).of  the  definition  we would suggest,  that  the  10 per cent.should be considerably increased.   If the percentage is  kept so low we considerthat work rooms  connected to shops would in  many cases  represent above 10 percent, of the  assessment  and  claims for relief would give rise to the expense andtrouble of splitting valuations, out of proportion  to the relief.  We woidd  proposeat least 20 per cent.    3.  We suggest that  the immunity from  Local Rates to be enjoyed  by newbusinesses and extensions of old  businesses should be further emphasized.  Thiswill undoubtedly be one of tho most  striking  and easily appreciated  points  of yourscheme.    We ret urn herewith  a copy of your Memorandum  offering  a few suggestions for verbal  and other minor alterations.&apos;    We feel  that you have greatly strengthened your whole scheme and  that itwill  undoubtedly  have  a strong  influence  in  the  regeneration of   productiveindustry.                                             Yours sincerely,                                                    ARTHUR DUCKHAM.
