The Labour Party will oppose it on the gx-ound that it is not sufficiently stringent  in so far as  it falls short of their ov*n Bill of 1924, and there  are  no doubt a number in the Conserv ative Party who will oppose it on the ground that it will impose  burdens that.inlustr at the  present moment is quite unable to bear.

This memor- andum was  considered by the Cabinet at a meeting on the 22nd Deo ember,  and  the  Home Secretary  was authorised to prepare a  3ill  for  the Cabinet&apos;s  consideration - sec Cabinet Conclusions 6-: (27) -I-.  The Bill is in course  of preparation. The Home Secretary  circulated a memorandum (E.J..25 (27 )) to the Home Affairs Committee, on this Bill on the 18th i2arch last year.  The memoran- dum was considered  by the Cabinet at their meeting on 23rd March (Cabinet 18(27) page 13) and they authorised the introduction in the House of Lords of the  Bill submitt- ed for their consideration. The Bill was introduced and passed the House of Lords but progress with it in theHouse of Commons was made impossible owing to lack of. time. The  purpose of the  Bill is to make permanent  the powers  under whioh Orders regulating the  control  of aliens may be made.  In  the absence of the provisions contained  in the Bill,it  will be necessary in  futureu  as  ithas been in  the  past, to- Include the  Aliens  Restriction (Amendment)  Act, 1919, eachyear in the  Expiring  laws Act.

It has been circulated in draft to the interests mainly concerned and, apart from criticisms of detail, attracts a largemeasuro of support.   There has beon no general legis-lation with regard to motor vehicles since the passingof tho Motor Car Act, 1903, when the motor car was inits infancy and the existing law and regulations on thissubject are now out of date.   The Bill adapts the law to modern conditions, makes provision for modifyingspeed limits and for abolishing the general limit inrespect of ordinary motor cars, strengthens the law inregard to dangerous and careless driving, restrictspillion riding, provides for declarations of physicalfitness on the part of drivers of motor vehicles andother matters.      Part II of the Bill is confined mainly toalterations in the law relating to highways recoramendedby the Soysl Commission on Local Government.     Part III establishes a much needed control (to beexercised through tho local licensing authorities) overthe construction and operation of public service vehicles in the interests of public safGty and convenience andof good order on the roads,   It provides for anadequate standard of construction and maintenance ofthese vehicles and reouires their owners to satisfy

The Bill was recently approved by the HomoAffairs Committee.   It hss been revised inaccordance with their decisions on certain points and is road;/ for consideration in further detail and could be introduced without difficulty at anearly date.fii)
LONDON  TRAFFIC.                                         104      At the end  of July, the London Traffic AdvisoryCommittee presented a report on this subject, sketchingthe outlines of a scheme for the co-ordinated management of passenger agencies in London, based on a pooling of receipts or &quot;Common Fund&quot;.   The Report itself pointed outthat there were many important questions of detail and offinanoo which   the Committee would hav9 to explore further with the parties  concerned but expressed the opinion that further negotiations would be waste of time if the Governmentwas not prepared  to &quot;promote or support&quot; legislation to giveeffect to the general principles of the arrangementssuggested,  which included a substantial measure of publiccontrol to be exerted through tho Minister acting on theadvice of the Committee.   No decision was taken except to publish tho Report and circulate it to all interests concerned.    This was done early in October.   Replies havebeen received which in the main favour a solution on thelines recommended by the Committee, subject to reservationsa3 to the application of the two principles of a CommonManagement and a Common Fund and as to the basis of thefinancial sohome and as to details.  My Advisory Committeeis pursuing points on which various interests have a3kedfor an elucidation and has recently also brought the mainline railways into d&amp;soussion.     It is not possible to put  forward a Bill enforcingupon important local authorities and private interests a compulsory schome of co-ordinated management and finance inthe absence of substantial agreement and until the Committeehaa reported upon essential points (including the preoiaenature of the co-ordinated management and the pooling scheme)which they have reservod for further consideration,  I am not                            fiii)
possession or; a scheme which can bo sal-..&apos; to bo both agreed and workable.  I hopo, however, that the negotiations with are now in active progress may shortly result inpracticable pro. csals of a definite nature, moreespecially as all the patios recognise, as I do, the urgency of the matter.    The existing Lone on Traffic act of 1224 expires at the end of the year.
CHARSIilS P0V/LR5 PL1 TR-M? SPORT udTddRTdglilG-S.           Since the war:, it has heennecessary to continueyear after year in the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Acttemporary powers to authorise increased charging powers for various transport undertakings which would he financiallyembarrassed if they were forced to return to a pro-war level of charge and which in many cases cannot afford thecost of proceeding by private Bill or provisional order.           The result is that orders have to be madeannually and much avoidable work is caused, bothdepartmentally and to Advisory Committees, while theundertakers are put to advertising and other expanses.           I have long been pressed to make permanentprovision for adjusting Tramway charges by a short Bill,which would not be controversial, giving the Minister ofTransport power to modify statutory charges on the applica-tion of the undertakers or the local authority or localratepayersa    A Bill was drafted last Session, but in viewof the congestion of business was not submitteu.  It isconsidered that its introduction should be no longerdelayed.           The Rates Advisory Committee, to whom Earbour andpock Charges are referred, has quite recently asked that something should be done to reduce work or expense  inconnection with the annual applications now required to bemade by about a score of small harbours (mainly fishingharbours in Scotland).   The;? suggest a short 3111continuing for a period of five years, instead of cue year as at present, the temporary  orders now in operation underthe authority of the Minister of Transport.                           (v)
          I thin.&apos;: that it is high tine that the BrrpiringLa*vs Continuar-ee Bill should ho relieved ox both these items and shall be  lac. of authority to draft Billsaccordingly and to discuss then with the interests concerned.
