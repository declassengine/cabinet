[This Document is  the  Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                    Printed for tlie Cabinet.  February 1028.SECRET.CP  45 (28).                                                            3Statutory Commission.   r circulate for the information of  the Cahinet a copy of a  telegram  received  fromSir .1. Simon.       TxniA OFFIOK,                                           BIRKENHEAD.     14th February  1928.       Telegram from Indian Statutory Commission, dated 11/7/ February 1028.    Private and personal.  Following from Simon :     &quot;lam grateful  for  your suggestion  that  we should  interview those opposed loboycott and make fact  widely  known.   We are following this course, and yesterdayCommission received important deputation of  Moslem  members of  Assembly, alsoAnglo-rndian depuration, and we have  issued  to the Press of  India lull communiquedescribing what passed.  My information is that, this is having disintegrating effect in indian Parliamentary circles.  To-da)- we receive  similar deputation from  depressed classes and others.   Many individual legislators seek private interviews with me alone,but  pressure  exerted  by irreconcilables is  beyond  all  belief.  On Thursday  next.critical  debate takes place  in  Assembly on resolution  to have  nothing to do  withCommission.   Amendment  will  be moved  from  Moslem  bench recognising  that procedure proposed  by  my letter to Viceroy merits favourable consideration of Rouse.Division is  likely to be very close, ami  result largely depends  on whether certain members  now  following boycott out of  timidity  will  (? omission);  but  if so, ourgreatest difficulty is  that opinion is entertained  in these quarters that if  Legislatureupholds boycott, Commission will  return to England in  March, and announce that itcannot go on, with  result that another Commission including Indian  representatives will have to  he appointed.   (Ireatly   regret to  say  that  this  absurd  view  is actually  encouraged  by  irresponsible   talk of a  private  Member  of  Parliamentnow out here,  who  thereby greatly embarrasses  Hartshorn  and  \tllee.   I think itwould  greatly strengthen I  lartshorn&apos;s hands  in seeing  Joshi and others to-morrowif  he had telegram from MacDouald saying that whole of responsible Labour Partyin   England recognise that, the  Commissions proposed procedure fully complies withthe conceptions and intentions of the Party, and  repudiating the  possibility of anyresponsible  Government  in England going further  in  the future.   My  Labourcolleagues on the Commission have throughout acted  splendidly,  and there is noshadow of difference between any of us inside the Commission.&quot;
