THIS DOOTMBHT 13 THIS PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY&apos; S GOVfeftigjgHT.                         0 A 3 I  N I&apos; T.             Copy No^Ctid                Extension of  the  Local Authorities                  (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1926.               Memorandum by  the  Minister of neelth.          In November last I submitted a paper (CP.297(27) )to my colleagues on this  subjeot  and it was agreed that a Billshould be introduced in  the coming  Session extonding theoperation of this Aot without modification for a further twoyears.  This decision wes  taken in  view of the prospects of theearly introduction of a moasuro of  poor lav; reform which would automatically remove the need for the continuance of theMetropolitan Common Poor Pund and the vioious results in somedirections of the expenditure by  local bodies at their discretion of monies largely drawn  from a larger area.          The effect of  the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund onadministration and expenditure has  recently been the subject ofa good deal of public notice in tho Press and of representationsreceived from bodie3 such  as the London Municipal Socioty.  ThoUnions which, on the whole, pay moro than they receive from theFund have also submitted  to me proposals for the reduction ofthe burden falling on themselves  and of the incentive toextravaganoo in the poorer Unions which is provided by thePund.  There oannot be any doubt  that the present system ofpayments out of the Fund does encourage lax and wastefuladministration and that it must be held to be very largelyresponsible for the great  growth  of expenditure on out-relief in East London.   In short tho Fund at present direotly assiststho spread of Poplarism;   and I fear that a proposal merely toextend the existing provisions without modification will,SECRETJ-IT, 53 (28).
notwithstanding the possibility of a general measure of Poor law reform being brought into operation in about two years&apos; time,result in the Government being subjected to a great deal of hostile criticism.       *&apos;  The Government1 s intervention to get rid of abuses in west Earn and elsewhere and the passing of the recent Audit Acthave commanded a great deal of support and have met with success.It will be olairaed, with a good deal of  truth,  that there is just as strong, if indeed not a stronger, case for some measure for combatting the evils resulting from the Metropolitan CommonPoor Fund.          In these oiroumstanoes I have given much considerationto the possibility of introducing some system of control of theexpenditure which is ohargeable on the Fund.   I need not troublemy colleagues with the details of the proposals submitted by the cities of London and Westminster with the concurrence of the otherpaying Unions.   For reasons which seem to mo convincing theseproposals as they stand cannot be accepted, but the principle that representation should acoompany taxation applies very definitelyin this case and I have come to the conclusion that the proper course is to put control of the Fund into the hands of some bodyrepresenting the ratepayers of London as a whole, including both those who pay to the pund more than they receive and those who receive from the Fund more than they pay.          It is obviously undesirable, if it is avoidable,that a spooial representative body should be set up for thispurpose,  though if it were decided to set up a separatebody it would be pos3iblo to arrange it3 constitution with aview to seouring an expeditious and efficient machine ofcontrol, while the existing bodies, formed for other ptirposos,are, particularly in virtue of the number of their members, not altogether convenient for practioal administration.                              2.
          Two such representative bodies are already in existenoe.Of these tho London County Council is not at present a poor lawbody and, in the present position of poor law reform, theappointment of the Counoil to represent London on this matter would he keenly resented by tho poor law authorities.  more over it would be at least doubtful whether tho London County council would at the present time ba prepared to acoept the proposedresponsibility.   The Metropolitan Asylums Board, on the otherhand, is not so large as the County Council and is composed ofmembers representing each of the London Boards of Guardians with additional members nominated by myself and constituting one-quarter of the whole Board.   It may be argued that theAsylums Board was set up solely to deal with institutionalrelief and ought not to be entrusted with the control ofthe Fund, much of which (and the most debatable part of whioh)relates to expenditure on out-door relief, but in fact muchof the Fund is applied towards the repayment of expenditureon institutional relief, and many at least of the members ofthe Asylums Board who represent the Boards of Guardians are known to be active in the whole work of the Guardians whom they represent, including the administration of out-door relief.          I therefore submit to my colleagues that the extensionof the Act of 1926 should be accompanied by a new provisionvesting in the Metropolitan Asylums Board the control of paymentsout of the Fund and the duty of protecting London as a whole fromimproper charges made by particular parts of London.          I attaoh a draft shewing in greater detail the provisions which I at present have in mind in this raspeot.  It would of course be necessary for me to disouss the mattor with the Chairman of theMetropolitan Asylura.3 Board, but I havo reason to suppose that theBoard would probably be willing to undertake the duty sought to be imposed upon them.
             I should  edd  that  I have very  carefully considered   tho alternative  plan of a provision  vesting  a discretionary   control of the payments out  of  the  -Stand  in myself as Minister   of Health, but on several grounds,  and principally  because   (a) London should protect London&apos;s money, end (b) discretionary   control in the hands of the  Minister will be attacked  r.s being   a dovice for the victimization  of his political  opponents, I   have come to the conclusion  that  it  is better that  the   Metropolitan Asylums Board should take the whole responsibility   in the matter.                                             15.0.February, 19S0.
