(THIS DOOUhSKT IS THE P^PERTY CF HIS BRITANHIO UAJESTY1 S GOVERfoiEKT).SECRET,                                              COPY NO.  3 C.P.  41 (ge)..                           CABINET.                THE IlflP^IclAL WIRSLSbS AND CABLE CONFERENCE.             l-Memorandum by  the Secretary of State for Scotland.                         (Chairman of tile  Conference).               1.  The Imperial v/ireless and Cable Conference has          held a number of  meetings,  meet  of which have been occupied          in  hearing evidence from the Eastern Telegraph Company          and from the harconi Company and its subsidiaries in the          Dominions.   I do not think it necessary to recapitulate          the complicated problem which is before the Conference,          which is presented in detail in the second report cf the          Cabinet Committee which led to the summoning of the          Conference (Cabinet Paper 316 (27)).   But an important          point has now arisen upon which a Cabinet decision is          required.               2.  The Eastern Company and the harconi  Company have          for acme weeks been engaged in negotiation with a view          to  an amalgamation.   These negotiations are  still proceeding          and neither party can say whether they will end in an          agreement.    But in the meantime both parties have          submitted to the  Conference aproposal for the constitution          of  a single amalgamated company  which will take over and          administer, either itself or through subsidiary companies          in  the Dominions, the whole of the cable and wireless          services of the Empire.    These  would include,  besides the
cable and wireless services which the Companies at presentwork, the oeai.; services now worked by the Post Gffico,which the Companies are anxious to secure, and the Pacificand Imperial Cables which the; do not want but realise theywould probably have to purchase.   The Companies recognisethat the public would not tolerate a monopoly of this kindwithout some safeguard a3 to rates, and they would submittc some form of external control of rates, possibly withthe Railway and Canal Commission as final arbiters.     5.  It has bocome clear in the course of discussion that the Dominion representatives are generally averse toamalgamation in any form but are unwilling to apply to their governments for definite instructions cn policy until theycan say whether the Imperial government will or will notconsent tc transfer the oeam services to a private undertakinand this is the point cn which a dr^cisicn is needed before we can get any further.     4.  In favour of such a transfer it may be claimed thatit would be an alluring bait which would probably go along way towards bringing the two Companies togetr-erjthey would be secure against any effective competition,either by cable or wireless, and the Beam services wouldprovide them -with profits which would make the amalgamationmore attractive to share-holders.   Considerable economiescould be made by the closure of competitive offices andthe unification cf staffs, and the problem of the relationbetwoen cable and wireless rates could be solved by theamalgamated company cn whatover lines it found most convenient.
     5.  On tiie other hand -   (l)  The public and the press would certainly vie-.; withsericus nisgjving the constitution of a gigantic trustcontrolling Imperial communications and the elimination of any competition, and they would probably suspect,(which is indeed a fact), that any form of external controlof rates is likely to be tedious and in the long runineffective.   Although most cf the cable and wirelesslicences for many years have included a control of ratesclause, providing for reference in case of dispute to theRailway and Canal Commission, it has never been invoked,not because rates have been sufficiently low, but becausethe powers were thought to be in practice useless,   (S)  Even if a system of rate control acceptable tothe Dominions and the Company could be devised, it wouldnot of course have the advantages of competition in stimulating spaed and efficiency, the development of new-services, etc.   The policy cf the .:arccni Company hasbeen tc maintain rates at the highest possible levelconsistent with attracting a sufficient volume of traffic,and when relieved ,of cable competition tho same policy could be pursued without the check which competitionhas given.   (S)  The  ,eam services, unlike most other wireless services, are extremely lucrative, and the Post office are at present making about  150,000 a year nett profitwhich accrues to the Exchequer.
Chancellor of the Duchy by the Cabinet are concerned your committee do not suggest any modification, but they thinkthat in certain particulars those instructions may usefully be further developed.  They suggest that at the present justice there is an opportunity for our representative to take the initiative and that this would be ofadvantage.  In the first place they consider that the promotion of agreements on Locarno lines where they are appropriate might be boldly advocated.  It Is true thatthe-particular position which is to be found on the Rhineof two conflicting interests between which a third Power,notwithstanding its previous commitments3  holds the balanceagainst agression on either sido, is not precisely repro-duced elsewhere.  But the principle of an agreement betweenseveral powers,  guaranteeing any one of their number againstbeing the victim of agrossion by any other, can be appliedregionally elsewhore - as of course it obtains In a limiteddegree bstwean the members generally of the League ofHations itself.   The Committee have asked th9 Foreign Officeto prepare a paper for the use of our representative givingin detail the severed regions in Europe where opportunitieson these lines seem possible.  It is of course not suggestedthat these will In all cases be suitable for public debate,or indeed that any of them will bear discussion without acertain reserve, but it is hoped that this information willgivo our representative material for Great Britain to takethe lead on this subject.     In addition to this tho Committee think that the Finnishproposal should be pushed forward without  hesitation,  andthis whether it is rscelved with enthusiasm by other powers or not.  The Cabinet will remember that in the recommendation on this head in their previous report the  Committee weightedtheir recommendation of the proposal with  tho oonditionthat it was not to be pressed except as
     6 *  There is good reason to believe that one of theprinoipal aims cf tho Marconi-Eastern policy is tosecure tho &apos;3eaic stations through which telephone services which the Empire will ultimately be conducted.   Itis probably that telephone services will be at least asprofitable and perliaps more so than the telegraph services, and from a practical point of view it is highl/desirable that they should be worked by the Post office which controls the inland system.   While the physicaltransfer of a telegram from one administration toanother en route presents little difficulty, it would be extremely difficult tc work a telephone system with, thecontrol at this end divided between two organisations.,The routine administration must necessarily be centeredat the Trunk Exchange in London and the correspondingExchange in each Dominion:  they alone coyfld determinesuch questions o,s &quot;whether speech v/as practicable orwhen the service should he closed, and they alone formthe link between the wireless and the local telephonesystem.   The intervention of a company having the majorfinancial interest would be a constant source cffriction.
      7.    I nay  add  that the  Dominion representatives   u 0while generally  averse  to amalgamation  in any form, areespecially insistent upon the necessity of  retaining theindependent companies within  each  Dominion.   The actualrelations  between  the proposed  amalgamation and  itssubsidiary companies have not yet  been  formulated, hat theintention  probably is to retain  companies which  arenominally  independent hut of which the  shares will beheld  and the policy  controlled by  the parent company inLondon.      8.    I have told the conference that the transfer ofthe Government Beam stations to  an amalgamated company would be a complete reversal of  the policy which for thelast  four years has held the field, and raises issues which I thought would make the Government hesitate to acquiesce  in it, but that I would  obtain a decision assoon as possible on the subject.                                           )     9.    If the Government services are not handed over,it may be that the proposed amalgamation will fall to theground.    In thet  event, the next  step would prohahly heto negotiate some  arrangement for  an agreed tariff, or forseme form of joint purse, either of which could  be combined with a sliding scale- providing for a reduction of rates astraffic grew.    Provided the Eastern Company caa  heassured of sufficient traffic to yield thorn a reasonablereturn, I feel convinced they would he most reluctant to liquidate a system which has taken 50 years to build up.    10.    If on the other hand the amalgamation proceededwithout including the Government services,  the task of negotiating a  concordat  with the amalgamated company mightbe rather easier.   j\s  this  alternative  may come  beforethe Conference at any time,  I should  be  glad to know  whetherthe Cabinet would object,  on grounds  of  principle,  to an amalgamation of the Eastern  and/
Marconi Companiesj assuming a suitable arrangement for workingad between the Government services and those of the amalga; a tedCompany could be arrived at.   The Government havo an effective veto upon amalgamation, if they choose to exerciseit, by refusing assent to the assignment of the licences heldby the separate companies.   Hut if they did 30, we should,of course, be saddled with a greater responsibility for findingan acceptable basis of negotiation with the Eastern Company,and the position of the Company in any such negotiation wouldprobably be rather stronger.   An amalgamation would not,I gather, be welcomed by the Dominions, but if the BritishGovernment were prepared to accept it in principle, theDominions Tt? uld probably find it extremely difficult to pres3their objections unless they are prepared with some alternativesolution.   It would, of course, be necessary to Insist thatthe amalgamated company would submit to an obligation tomaintain the cable system, both on the trunk routes and tothe less important places which have no alternative means of                                     of matterscommunication, and there would be a number/ suoh as.-&apos;safeguardsto ensure British ownership; which would be the subject ofdiscussion with the company.   11. Summary.   An answer Is desired accordingly to thetwo following questions-       Is the Cabinet prepared to agree in principle to:       (a) Handing over all Imperial communications - cable,           beam wireless and beam telephone (when the latter           arrives) to be worked by           (1)  An amalgamated i.larooni/Eastern Company,                subject to appeal as to rates to some Tribunal,                the Governments having no holding in such                Company,           (2)  A Company In which H.M. Government and the                Dominions have a controlling financial                interest, the balance of capital being found                by an Amalgamated Jvlarooni/Esstern Company&apos;;       If not       (b) The amalgamation of the Marooni and Eastern           Companies to work the Imperial and Foreign services           at present conducted by them with a concordat           between such Company and the Government as to the
working of their services  and  the  Government services?(signed)  jor.:: GIL:/.OU?..2, white hall Gardens, S.1.     February 13th, 1928,
