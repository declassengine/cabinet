THIS DOCIMEKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BHTTAMNI C MAJESTY * S QOVBHSMSgT.                          CAE! MET.     The Law relating to  the  Sale and  Supply or Intoxieating                             Liquor.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland,          The Memorandum of 24th October,  1927,  (C.P.252  (27))  bytho Home Secretary suggesting the appointment  of a Royal  Coimrri sslonto inquire into the whole field of lioensing legislation  dealsof oourse with the situation as existing in England  and Wales only,and it may be useful that I should supplement  it by  a  brief statement as to the position in Scotland es regards  this  matter,          I  think it may safely be said that in  Sootland  at  present there is no  very active feeling on the  points  which  the HomeSecretary mentions as exciting interest and controversy in England,though the appointment of a royal Commission in  England would doubtless stir up discussion in Scotland on some, at any  rate,  ofthese matters.   It eeeme probable, however, that any  demand forinquiry in Scotland would be based mainly  upon the merits or defectsof the Temperance (Scotland) Act, 1913,   The  local  optionprovisions of that Statute became operative in 1920.   Numerouepolls have since been held under these  provisions, and the resultantexperience has evoked criticism from  very  varied angles.          In these ciroumBtancea, I am  of  opinion that theappointment  of a Royal Commisalon for England  and Wales would leadto a demand  whioh it would not be easy  to  resist for an inquiryin Scotland, and that the differences in the law and in tho  topicsof interest  would necessitate the appointment  of a separate scottish Commission.                                 &apos;JOHN  CrlLMOUR&apos;..P.7 (28).3th January, 1*28.
