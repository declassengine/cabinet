mm..                     GAM 1L&amp;JL.Col. 1 (23).          lam] ff oraaaJiJi.gldna&amp;s^Mflra.                Manaraiito-ky. the Jilrgt L&apos;iri..oi the. Admiralty.                       It was decided in June, 1927, (CP. 180/27) to             withdraw tho Aircraft Carrier H*M.S-&quot;Hermes&quot; during the             period November, 19^7, to February, 1928, inclusiva.                       H .K*8 ..&quot;Hermes&quot; will arrive back on the China             Station in March and the Commander-in-Chief reports that on             her return ho can dispense with EJ-T.3.&quot;Argus&quot; and all             aircraft now on the Station except those carried in &quot;Hermes&quot;             and &quot;Vindictive&quot; and one Reconnaissance Flirrht of six             machines.                       For tho purposes of training- it is very desirable             that &quot;Argus&quot; should rejoin the Atlantic Fleet as soon as             possible and for the same reason the return of the other             flights is necessary as their personnel are not getting             experience in Naval Air Work.                       If these withdrawals are carried out there will             remain cn the China Station, E.MoS-&quot;Hermes&quot; with 15 aircraft,,             6 aircraft based on shore,  and 3 aircraft in &quot;Vindictive&quot;             until that vessel is relieved by &quot;Cumberland&quot; in the Spring.                       Unless any of my colleagues wishes to raise             objection to this proposal it seems unnecessary to summon             the China Committee to discuss itc   I shall therefore give             the necessary directions as soon as H.M.S.&quot;Hermes&quot; sails,             i.e. about 21st January, unless I have learned of any &apos;             objection before  that  date.                                             *&apos;/.  C * B.Admiralty, S.W.I.     12th January, 1923.
