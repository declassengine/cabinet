Copy No.   30CP. 50 (28).               TO  BE  KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND  KEY.It is requested  that special care may be taken    to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.REDUCTION  OF  EXPENDITURE  IN  1928.              MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.    THE total amount  of economies secured as  specified  in CP. 31  (28)  is 7,086,000.  Subsequently the Minister of Health has offered to reduce the provisionfor  Public Health  Grants by  35,000 (as compared with the  150,000 suggested).I have accepted this offer.  This brings the total up to  7,101,000.  But on the other side the decision of the Cabinet in regard to the Irish Loyalists involves an increaseof expenditure of  375,000.    As  regards the remaining items referred to in  CP. 31 (28) :     .\avy. The First Lord&apos;s reply to my final proposal that the Estimates should         be fixed at  57  millions (after a shadow cut of   2-2  millions) offers no         further saving.  I intend, therefore,  at a later date to suggest measures         which will enable Navy Estimates to be reduced to this figure.    A ir. I do not know the result of the further review undertaken by the Secretary         of State.    Empire Marketing Board.   Overseas Settlement. These questions were post-         poned by the Cabinet  until the return of  the  Secretary  of State  fur         Dominion Affairs.   I  must urge my colleagues to decide definitely that         these reductions should be made.    War Graves Commission. I hope I may now receive the assent of the Secretary         of State for War to  the proposed postponement of the increased provision         for the Endowment Fund.    Scientific and Industrial Research. I  no longer desire to press  this proposal         after the  explanations which have  been furnished by the Director of the         Department.    Office of  Works. I attach a  letter which  I have received from  the First         Commissioner.  The excision of Labour Exchange items would produce no         saving to the Exchequer, as they  are  of  course paid for out  of  the         Unemployment  Insurance Fund.   The  provision  for new Post  Office         Buildings, I  am informed, has already been reduced to  an abnormally low         figure, and any  further reduction may have a detrimental  effect  on  the         revenue.    The Cabinet now has the material for a final decision on the proposal to transfer to the  Exchequer the balance of the Boxer Indemnity  Fund.  Even this  is not       [17234]
sufficient, and definite economies are also necessary on the Navy and under some ofthe other headings mentioned above.  In any event all these questions must be settledto-morrow as Estimates can no longer lie kept open.                                                                   W.  S.  C.    Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,         February 16, 1028.                                  II.M. Office of Works, Storet/s Gate,My dear Chancellor,                     Westminster, S.W., February 14,  1928.    I HAVE very carefully considered the possibility of a further cut in the Officeof Works estimates, but I am absolutely convinced  that  no further  savings couldbe effected except by cutting out such buildings as Post Offices and Labour Exchanges.Such drastic economies would,  of course,  affect other Departments rather than theOffice of Works.  Of course,  all of these  buildings have already been agreed to bythe  Treasury, but T am perfectly ready to strike some of them off  the programme  ifthe  Treasury can secure the consent of the interested Departments.                                                           Yours sincerely,                                                       (Signed)       PEEL.    The Rt.  Hon.  W. S. Churchill, C.H., M.P.,                 II.M. Treasury.
