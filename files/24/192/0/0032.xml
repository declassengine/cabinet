[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majcstv&apos;s Government.               Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1928.Copy  No.     30CABINET.IRAQ:  FUTURE OF THE  RAILWAYS.       MEMORANDUM CIRCULATED BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.    I CIRCULATE for the  consideration of the Cabinet a memorandum prepared inthe Treasury in reply to the Colonial  Office memorandum CP. 321 (27).    In view of the paramount  importance of  maintaining Government credit, i must ask the Cabinet, as a matter of financial  principle, to reject the policy of a guaranteed loan, leaving  the Treasury and  Colonial Office to settle  the best  methodof financing the Iraq Railways without violating this principle.                                                                  w. s. c.    Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,        February 6, 1928.    1.  This is a proposal that  His Majesty&apos;s Government should assist in the reconditioning and development of the Iraq Railway system by guaranteeing a loan of  2,100,000 in order to provide  new capital for the purpose.    2.  The Colonial Office accept without question Brig.-Gen. Hammond&quot;s estimate that  2,100,000 is the minimum amount of capital that must be raised in the nearfuture, and support their proposal for a British Government  guarantee by threearguments :     (a.) That this is the only means of safeguarding the large amount of British           capital already sunk in these Railways,  and that it is therefore in the           interest of the Treasury themselves to give the guarantee.    (b.) That the course is consistent with our general responsibilities towards Iraq,           as helping to establish a vital public service on a sound basis.    (c.) That there  is,  in effect,  no alternative  which  would  not ;be politically           objectionable.                                                       j    3.  Argument (b) may be briefly dismissed. It cannot be seriously contended that at this stage, after taking into account all that  we have already done for Iraq,we are required to deal with this  proposal from any other point of view  than thatof our own interest.    4.  As the first argument is admittedly based on financial considerations, it must rest with  the Treasury, and not with the Colonial  Office, to estimate  whether itsadvantages outweigh the general objections to impairing British credit by the giving of further guarantees.    The answer is an emphatic negative.  Throughout the whole of the post-war period debt conversion operations have been seriously hampered by the  continualadditions to the volume of our liabilities in the shape of guaranteed loans.   Alreadywell over  100 millions have been guaranteed and very important commitments stillexist  and will  have to  be faced  in  the near future,  including  33 millions for electricity and  10  millions for East  Africa.  Apart from this, the Government hasraised much  more than  200 millions on its own  credit and  handed it to localauthorities to be spent on housing and other of their capital works. These additions      [17174]SECRET.CP. 32 (28).
to our liabilities are most serious, and they have largely  or even wholly -nullifiedthat rapid improvement of credit which should have resulted from the great sacrificeswhich the taxpayer has been called on to  make in order to provide a large  annualSinking Fund.     These  facts are well known  to  the  House of Commons, and Parliamentaryauthority for the giving of guarantees has not been obtained without considerable and  very pertinent  criticism.  The termination of the guarantees under the TradeFacilities Acts was  hailed as a definite step in the direction of limiting our  obliga-tions, and what is important now is to avoid giving rise to any  apprehension that thispolicy is again to be reversed.     We are entering on what is perhaps the most crucial period since the War fordebt conversion.  For the first time in  the  past two years Government credit, as measured by the price  of Government stocks, shows very definite signs of improve-ment.  With the possibilities ahead of securihg substantial savings from conversionof the 5 per cent. War Loan, it would be little short of disastrous if this recoverywere to be impeded.  Nothing, however, is  more certain to impede the recovery  thanthe announcement of large new Government guarantees, a step which would be inter-preted in all  quarters as a  return  to the policy of  continually  increasing  our commitments.     5.  It  remains  to be considered what is the alternative if a guarantee is refused.Are  we certain to lose our money  (estimated at 250,000 lakhs, or, say,  1,875,000),and  is it inevitable  that the  railways should first be  financed by foreign capital, and ultimately  pass  under foreign  control, as the  Colonial  Olfice seem  to suggest(paragraph 12 of their memorandum)?  There is no need to apprehend either ofthese results.  As regards control, it has  already  been agreed  that the railways should be handed over  to a Corporation with a  strong British  element on the  Board,and  there seems  to be no reason why this change should not be carried out withoutfurther delay.   As regards finance, the Treasury venture to suggest that the problem is not really of the magnitude implied by General Hammond *s figure of  2.100,000,which provides for every imaginable contingency.  Of the total sum, only  1.100,000is required for  the principal undertakings recommended by  General  Hammond,viz.  :-             -/-&apos;                                                                          Extension from Kirkuk  to Mosul       ...       690,000            Baghdad  Bridge      ...       ...       ...       370,000            Khaniquin extension  ...       ...       ...        40,000The balance is for  improvements, which must, if need  be, continue  to  be financed from Renewals or Depreciation Accounts; for replenishing the Renewals Account,which can  wait; or for repaying  temporary advances and for interest on  capitalduring construction.  The Railway position is improving; but the Corporation mustbe content  to move slowly,  and  to cut  their coat  according  to  their cloth.   any immediate  pressure can be relieved domestically.   Resort has been had in the  pastto the Oil  Companies  and  to the Eastern Bank  for loans  at the easy rates of5 per cent,  and 6i per  cent,  respectively, and it seems reasonable to expect that theIraq Government should make advances if  necessary from its own surpluses.*  PastGovernment surpluses  have  been devoted largely  to  buying up the Iraq share of theOttoman Public Debt, with consequent saving of interest, but  it is intended to applyfuture surpluses to  a programme of capital works.   It  is for the Iraq Governmentto decide the precedence of railways and irrigation or other works, but if substantial sums are applied  to railway development and  the development is  spread  over a somewhat longer term  than  the four years recommended by General Hammond, theCorporation ought  to  be in a position to  obtain  a loan of moderate amount onsatisfactory terms to finance one or two of  the major works without resort to  Britishcredit.   Oh this basis the British Government may have to  wait somewhat longerbefore it receives any return  on its  investment, but there  is certainly no need to writeoff the capital as a dead loss.* The first half of 1927-2S, tho lean half-year, showed a surplus of -10 lakhs ( 300,000).
