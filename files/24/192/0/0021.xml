         The King&apos;s Speech on  the Opening of Parliament.                              FEBRUARY 7, 1928.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    MY  relations  with foreign  Powers continue to  bo  friendly.   It  is the constant effort of My  Government, in co-operation with the League of Nations,to secure the  settlement of  international  differences and  to promote  the  causeof peace.    T have  invited the King of  Afghanistan to visit Me in March and  I look forward  to  welcoming  His Majesty  to My capital.   It  will  be  a  particularpleasure  to  Me to receive  His Majesty on his first visit to Europe.    The  position in China has so far improved as to permit large reductions  inthe naval and military forces sent to  the Far East  for  the protection of MyBritish and  Indian subjects resident in the Concessions, but  tho situation causedby internal  disturbances and civil wars and  the  consequent insecurity of life and property,  both Chinese and  foreign, still  give cause  for anxiety.  In spiteof these  discouraging circumstances,  My Government adhere to  the declarationof policy published by them a year ago, as the basis on which they are preparedto meet Chinese aspirations when the Chinese can assure  satisfactory protection for British lives and property.    On the  29th  December last  the  United  States  Government communicatedto My  Ambassador  at Washington,  for  consideration  and  as  a  basis  for negotiation,  the draft of a new Treaty of Arbitration  between  Myself and thePresident of the  United  States  of America, to take the place of the  Treaty  ofArbitration  concluded  at  Washington  on  the -4th April, 190S.   The terms  ofthe new draft are being carefully and  sympathetically studied by My Governmentin Great  Britain  and will bo considered in communication  with My governments in the  Dominions.MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    The  Estimates  for  the Public  Services  will  be  laid before you  in  duocourse.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS  OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    Although  the  condition of affairs in  some  of  the  principal  industriescontinues to give cause for serious  anxiety, I am  glad  to  observe that in thegeneral  state  of  trade  and industry there  arc  many encouraging signs ofprogressive improvement  in  both our  home  and  external  trade  which justifythe hope  that with co-operation and good-will steady progress  will be made inthe coining your.    The  burdens imposed  upon  industry  and  agriculture  by  the presentincidence  of local rates have attracted tho anxious  attention of My Ministers.They  are  now  engaged  upon inquiries  into  tho  possibility of affording soinorelief  from those burdens to the producing community and  into the changes in local government which would thereby bo involved.    Proposals will be brought before you  for amending tho law relating to theparliamentary  and local government franchise.                                                                     (1714S)
    Measures  will   be  presented   to   you  for  giving  effect  to  certain recommendations of  My  Commission on  National Health Insurance, and  for increasing  the credit  facilities  of persons engaged in agriculture.    Among other Bills which you will be invited  to pass  are measures dealingwith the laws relating to the Supreme Court of Judicature and  to Arbitration,with the  amendment of the Companies  Acts, with  the  valuation  for ratingpurposes of property  in London, and with the  law relating to the MetropolitanCommon Poor Fund.    You will also  be  asked  to  consider proposals for the  reorganisation  ofcertain  of  the Departments in Scotland.    Bills  dealing with other measures of importance will be  introduced andproceeded with as time and opportunity allow.    I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
