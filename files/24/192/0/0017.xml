This Document is  the Property of His Britannic Majcsty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet   January 1928.                   confidential.                                             Copy No.CP. 17 (28).ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY OF ALLIANCE.        MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    SAlvWAT PASHA&apos;S difficulties in creating a sentiment among his compatriotsin favour of acceptance of the draft treaty appear on the whole to have been greaterthan he anticipated, or affected to anticipate, when he left this country.   Earlierreports indicated that Sarwat was not likely  to meet with any very determined orsuccessful opposition.  More recently, however, the left wing of the Wafd, which includes a number of irreconcilable extremists, appears to have succeeded in estab-lishing an  ascendancy over Mine. Zaghlul  and Nahas Pasha,  ZaghluFs  nominalsuccessor,  and, as a  result, to have  gained control of the  Wafd  party machine.which  is the only  political organisation in Egypt possessing any degree of efficiency.This development was not altogether unexpected.  A contributory cause is probably to be  found in the attitude of  King Fuad, who, after  promising  his support toSarwat Pasha  and  the  treaty,  has lately, according to  secret  service  reports,encouraged the opponents of  an alliance for reasons  of  his own.    Lord  Lloyd,however, has recently been instructed to convey a  serious warning  to  His  majesty in the  hope that as a result of it the  powerful influence which the Palace can wieldmay henceforth be exerted actively in  support of Sarwat.  But a far greater stimulus to the  Egyptian extremists may  probably  have been provided by messages conveyed to them by certain individuals in this country,  who, according to reports from secretsources, have encouraged the  belief  that His Majesty *s  present Government  will certainly be defeated at the next general election, and that  their successors will grant to Egypt far more generous  terms than are contained in the draft treaty.  Suchmessages, the true motives underlying which it is unnecessary to analyse, appear tomeet with a large measure of credence in Egypt.    On the other hand, the left wing of the Wafd, though at present it clearly hasthe upper hand so far as the party organisation is concerned, has bitter opponentsboth within the party itself and outside of it.  Barakat Pasha. ZaghluFs nephew.who was at one time regarded  as his  probable successor, heads the opposition inside the Wafd.  The Liberal and Unionist parties,  in which are to be found the majorityof Egyptians of  intelligence and  position,  are  almost openly in conflict with thoextremists.   The country in general appears dissatisfied with the Wafd leaders andtheir methods, and if it were able to express an independent and coherent opinion.which, unfortunately, is hardly the case,  this would probably be definitely in favourof a reasonable settlement with Great  Britain. . King Fuad,  in spite of passingflirtations with the Wafd, dislikes and fears  the extremists, who make little secret oftheir anti-dynastic plans.   Sarwat  Pasha  himself, according to the most recentreports, while frequently hesitant and  vacillating  in  face  of the strength of theopposition, appears to be  resolved to carry on the struggle.    Sarwafs difficulties  have led him  to demand a  number of explanations  andinterpretations of the text of the treaty, without which, he argued, it would be quite impossible for him to cany the  treaty with his colleagues in the Ministry.   for various reasons I  was  by  no means anxious  to furnish  in this  way unilateralinterpretations of an agreed  text, but in the  circumstances I felt bound to do so,rather  than  lose  Sarwafs co-operation,  and  with  it  any prospect  of reaching  asettlement in the near future.    It proved  possible to furnish Sarwat with the explanations for  which he askedregarding the text of the  treaty itself, without  disadvantage to ourselves, and T need only trouble my colleagues with two points which remain outstanding.  What  Sarwatasks in respect of them amounts not, as in the other cases, to an interpretation of the       42S4  [17111]
text, but rather to an actual  extension  of the provisions of  the treaty.   The two points in question are :                                        I.    Annex I (a) the text of which reads as follows : -         &quot;In default of previous agreement between  the high  contracting parties    to the contrary, British personnel on the existing scale shall be maintained  in    the Egyptian  army with  their present  functions and on  the conditions of the    existing contracts during the period of ten years provided for in article 7  of    the treaty.&quot;    The words &quot; in default of previous agreement to the contrary &quot;  were specificallyinserted  here in order to leave the door  open for a  reorganisation  of  our relationswith the Egyptian army, which are at present unsatisfactory  in some  respects, andas time goes on will tend  to become more so.  The  remainder of the clause was,  ofcourse,  designed to safeguard our position until  some scheme of reorganisationacceptable to us had been agreed upon.    At one point,  Sarwat  Pasha attempted  to argue that this clause covered only two British officers, i.e., those mentioned in  the notes exchanged during the crisis of last  summer on the subject of the Egyptian  army.  This  interpretation was obviously untenable, and Sarwat Pasha was so informed,  lie  has now  reverted to asuggestion  which has been raised in the  past lioth by the Egyptians and ourselves,but never actually worked out, namely, that the British element in the Egyptian army should be provided by  a military mission.   Such an  arrangement seems likely  to possess the considerable advantage of  not arousing  Egyptian opposition, and thustending  to  facilitate  the  task of  the  officers  concerned,  and of  ensuring thepermanency of the arrangement.   The War Olfice,  I understand, have no objectionto it, provided of course that the details of the scheme are satisfactorily worked out.T  therefore request the Cabinefs authorisation to inform  Lord  Lloyd that his proposal is approved,  and that he should, with  the assistance  of  the militaryauthorities in Egypt, at once open negotiations with Sarwat Pasha with a view  toarriving at an agreed scheme to be embodied  in  notes exchanged simultaneously withthe treaty&apos;s ratification.                                      II.    Annex II (c) which reads as follows :          &quot; Until the coming into force, as the result of agreements between Egypt    and the Powers concerned, of the reform of the capitulatory system contemplated    in article 9 of the treaty, the  Egyptian Government will  not modify, except  in    agreement with His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, the number, status and    functions of the British nationals  engaged at the moment in the public security    and police services.&quot;    The position is that Egypt in  the  near future contemplates calling a conferenceof the capitulatory Powers, at which she will seek their consent to a transfer of thejurisdiction at present exercised by the Consular Courts of each Power, to the MixedCourts, an  organisation  nominally Egyptian, but which  possesses  a  permanentmajority of foreign judges.  The disappearance of consular jurisdiction would implyalso the disappearance of such  foreign rights, as against the Egyptian Government,as the  inviolability  of domicile  rights which   are  jealously guarded  by thecapitulatory Powers,   ft  is most improbable that those Powers would consent  totheir nationals being subjected  to the Egyptian GovernnienCs police forces, acting on behalf of the Mixed Courts, unless these forces continue to comprise, as now, asufficient foreign element to ensure that the  arrest, &amp;c, of Europeans is carried out under the  supervision of  European police officers.   In short, Egypt, to obtain herdesiderata,  will have to satisfy the Powers in Cairo that she  has made satisfactory and  permanent arrangements in this respect.  This consideration  made  it possibleto adopt the clause in  question with  safety, seeing that unless Egypt agreed to aperpetuation of something in the nature  of the present regime, she would  not obtainthe assent of the Powers to her capitulatory demands, in which event the  status quowould be maintained under the terms of  the clause.     Sarwat  Pasha, however, represented that this provision  would excite so muchopposition in Egypt that the prospects of the treaty&apos;s acceptance would be reduced
to nothing, and asked that it should be supplemented by an exchange of notes, whichwould provide that notwithstanding a failure of the capitulatory conference, Egypfshands should be freed  in the matter of the police five years after the coming intoforce of the treaty.   This suggestion was inacceptable, but a counter-suggestion, tothe effect that His Majesty*s Government should undertake, in the event of a failureat the conference, to examine the question afresh, and  on its merits at the time, was described by Sarwat as quite inadequate from the point of view of Egyptian publicopinion.    I  therefore  request  the Cabinefs authority to  make  the following alternative offer to Sarwat, the terms of which would be embodied in notes exchangedwhen the treaty is ratified :         &quot; In default of the conclusion  within five years of the coming into force of     the treaty of agreements with  the Powers concerned  for the  reform of the     capitulatory  system as contemplated in Annex  If (c),  and  in default  of     agreement between His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government and  the Egyptian     Government for the modification of the provisions of that clause.  His Britannic     Majesty&apos;s Government  will join with the Egyptian Government  in inviting the     Council of the  League of Nations  to give a decision as to the numbers, status     and  functions of the British officials thenceforth to be employed in the public     security  and police services  in the  light of  the  conditions then  obtaining in     regard  thereto.   It  is understood that the  Governments shall adopt this     decision as an agreement come to between them as provided for in Annex II (c)     of the  treaty.&quot; &apos;     It  will be seen  that this virtually amounts to an offer to re-submit the question to the Powers sitting at Geneva some five years after it has been submitted to thePowers  sitting at a capitulatory conference  in Cairo.  The  factors governing adecision should, generally  speaking, be  the same  in  each  case, and unless  Egyptdemonstrates her willingness to maintain adequate police arrangements, it is hardlyto be supposed  that she will receive satisfaction from either body.  If and when thequestion  should be  submitted  to  the League,  it  seems likely that only an interimdecision  covering a limited number of years  could well be given.  I  would observe,moreover, that if  conditions are  unsatisfactory  at the time  of the reference to geneva, it is quite within the bounds of possibility that the  League might order anincrease in the European element in the Egyptian police.  In these circumstances. Iconsider  that  we can safely offer to Sarwat the proposed undertaking,  though, ofcourse. 1  am quite unable to say whether he will find it acceptable.     In conveying it to Sarwat. together with a message on  the subject of negotia-tions respecting a military mission. 1  propose to  make  it  quite  clear to him thatHis Majesty&apos;s  Government do not intend to enter into any further discussions onthese or other new points in the treaty.     Apart from the question of a military mission, referred to above, negotiations are not yet complete in the  matter of the division of the Nile waters,  and on certain minor points respecting capitulatory reform.  But agreement in principle has beenreached on the two latter subjects,  and  1 therefore propose  to  inform Sarwat thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government now expect him to lose no time in laying the treaty before his colleagues with a view to its early signature.                                                                      A. C.     Foreign  Office, January 26. 102S.
