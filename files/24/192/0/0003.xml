SECRETCP. 3(28).CABINET.2REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE (EQUAL FRANCHISE) BILL                  19 28.     Uerao rand tun by the Hone Secretary.      I circulate to my colleagues for consideration a first draft of the Franchise Bill.      The first part of tho Bill (Clauses 1 to 6) contains the necessary provisions for equalising the franchise of menand women and for incidental matters, although a few pointsarise upon these clauses to which special attention isrequired.      It will be seen that it is proposed to set out in full the franchise provisions of the Act of 1918 as proposed to be amended.   This course is preferable to legislatipn by reference in a matter of such complexity, and I do not thinkit is likely to delay the passage of the Bill.      In the second part (Clauses 7 to 11) I have includedprovisionally certain matters, entirely independent of theEqual Franchise question, which have been already before theCabinot or which have been suggested to me for considerationby the Central Office.   They are mostly Controversial andif included in the Bill will convert it from what would bein tho main an uncontrovercial measure into a controversialone.   It is necessary for me, therefore, to have an early decision of the Cabinet on the desirability of including some or all of them in the Bill, having regard to the otherparts of the Government&apos;s programme for next Session.      Clause 1 confers the parlianentary franchise on womenat 21 on the same basis as men (alike in respect of residence,EQUAL FRANCHISE PROVISIONS.
-2-in respect of occupation of business premises, and inrespect of the university qualification).      It further proposes to equalise the position asbetweon husband and wife by giving the wife of an occupier of business premises, as woll as the husband, an additionalvote in respect of that qualification.   (Conversely, thesame right will be given to the husband of a woman occupier).At present the woman can be registerod (at 30) in respect ofher husband&apos;s occupation of business premises as well as inrespect of his occupation of a rosidenco, but cannot, as the husband can,  vote in rospect of both.   it may be urged that,now the whole basis of the woman&apos;s franchise is being alteredand she is being given the qualification by residence only,there is no ground for retaining the qualification of a wifeby virtue of her husband&apos;s occupation of premises.   On theother hand, the withdrawal of this qualification would greatly disturb the position in constituencies like the city of London whore the number of women registered is 15,000out of a total electorate of 45,000.   It may be objectedalso that tho proposal will still further increase thedisproportion between the number of men&apos;s and women&apos;s votesand that it will give the married women an unfair advantage over the unmarried.   The answers to these objections are that the number of women affected will be small,  between150,000 and 200,000, and that tho married woman who makes the home and often helps to make tho business is as muchentitled to the second vote as the man and that there isno true equality without it.      Clause 2.   The local government franchise in atpresent possessed by women occupiers at 21 like men,  butmarried women also have it at 50 for premises of which their husbands are occupiers, if both reside there.   It isproposed to give the franchise to these women at 21 and toconfer a corresponding right on the husbands of womenoccupiers.   The number of married women in England and
Wales between 21 and 30 is 1,469,000 and the increase ofthe local government electorate will, with the inclusion ofthe husbands of women occupiers, be upwards of 1,500,000.      A change, not connected with tho equalisation of the franchise is also proposed.   At present, a man or woman isqualified for the local government franchise if he or she has occupied as owner or tenant during the qualifying periodany land or premises.   A &quot;service&quot; occupier of a dwelling house and a lodger in rooms lot unfurnished is regarded asan occupying tenant.   No minimum limit is placed in Englandon the value of the premises occupied, but in Scotland theAct of 1910 imposed a limit of  10 except in the case of adwelling house, and in Northern Ireland there is a similarlimit of  5.      There is much to be said for adopting the Scottishprecedent of a limit of  10.      Clauses 3 and 4 are consequential.      Clause 5.   As the Bill cannot bo passed in time forthe new voters to be includod in the 1928 register (the workfor which begins at the end of February) and as the 1928register would normally remain in force from 15th October,1928, to 15th October, 1929, it is necessary to make special provision to enable the new electors to vote at the next general Election in the event of its taking place beforethe latter date.   It is proposed that a special register,made up for a qualifying period ending on 1st December, 1928and coming into forco on 1st May, 1929, xshall be prepared,and that the register which would under the existing law beprepared in the autumn of 1929 shall be dropped.      Clause 6.   The large increase in the number of electors which will result from the proposed extensions ofthe franchise makes it dosirable to revise the provisions atpresent governing tho maximum expenses of candidates at parliamentary  elections.   The figures remain for decision.In Northern Ireland the amount is two pence for each elector
-4-3      The limit for county councils and municipal borough councils is two pence, and probably no change is required.There is no limit for other local elections.                     OTHER PROVISIONS.      Clause 7.   Under this clause Companies and othorCorporations would, through their representatives, be giventhe parliamentary and local government franchise on precisely the same terms and conditions as individual occupiers of landor premises.      I have already submitted the question of the Companyfranchise to the Cabinet in the Memorandum CP. 229(27) of51st August, 1927, which sets out the considerations affecting this subject,  and tho clause is drafted inaccordanco with the suggestions in that Memorandum.      It will be left to the Corporation to prefer its claim for its representative to be registered, that is, it willnot be the duty of the Registration Officer to seek out the corporations entitled to claim, and in ordor to preventplural voting the same person must be registered for allparliamentary constituencies in which the Corporation occupiesprerises, and for all the different wards, etc. of a localgovernment electoral area in which it occupies premises.      Corporations which are local authorities, or consist inthe main of members of such authorities are not enfranchised.Foreign companies are excluded.      I am in favour of the insertion *of this clause, whichwill be popular with the Party, subject to the general considerations affecting tho programme for next Session.      Clause 8 restores the poor relief disqualification forthe parliamentary and local government franchises which wasabolished by the Act of 1918.   Before that Act persons weredisqualified for being registered both for the parliamentary and the local government franchise if they had received peerrelief diiring tho 12 months &quot; qualif ying period&quot;.   The
-5-Speakers&apos; conference of 1917 recommended a mitigation only of the disqualification, namely, that relief, if given for not more than 30 days or by way of maintenance of a relativein a lunatic asylum, etc., should not disqualify  for theparliamentary franchise.   They made no suggestion withregard to the local government franchise.   There was ageneral feeling, however, in the House of Commons againstthe disqualification on the ground that poor relief was onlyone form of public assistance and its abolition which was proposed by the Coalition Government was accepted with verylittle dissent in tho Lower House.      Since 1918 a serious change has taken place in thepractice of administering poor lav/ relief in many districts and the scandals to which it has given rise arc a strong arguement for the restoration of the disqualification.   the votes of those who benefit by a lax and extravagant adminis-tration are cast in support of candidates who will pledgethemselves to extravagant expenditure, and a widespreaddemand has arisen that a stop shall be put to this abuse.      I am in favour therefore of including a provision forthe restoration of the disqualification in the Bill.   Ifthe Cabinet decides in favour of this being done, there are several points on which a decision is required.   In thefirst place, is the disqualification to extend to theparliamentary as well as tho local government franchise?It is in connection with the latter that* the scandals have arisen, but there is a difficulty in making a distinctionbetween the two franchises.   Moreover, if those who havereceived relief are disqualified for the local governmentfranchise only, and retain their Parliamentary votes, theymay bo expected to give those votes against the party whichhas disqualified them.   Secondly, how is the disqualifioa-tion to be applied?   Undor the law before 1918 a personwas disqualified if ho received relief during the IP months&apos;qualifying period.   That method&apos; seems inapplicable now
&apos;&quot;&quot;I suggest that the limit should be fixed at not less  than6 woeks.    We do not want to disqualify the honest  workerwho falls into temporary misfortune,  but only the work-shywho wants to live on the public.tliat the qualifying period has been reduced to ?. months.It would appear too arbitrary a method to disqualify onaccount of relief received during a particular period of3 months and not for relief during any othor period -especially where that period of 3 months may be as much as18 months before the election in respect of which thodisqualification applies.      The Bill proposes, therefore, the method adopted in thedraft Poor Law Reform Bill which has been circulated to theCabinet by the Ministor of Health - namely, to attach the disqualification to relief received during tho year precedingtho election.   This method would accord with the common law before elections wore held by ballot.      The names of the persons disqualified would be furnisheby the clerk to the guardians at the time of the election totho Registration Officer who will strike their names out ofthe copies of the register to be used at the polling stations      The clause in the Bill reproduces for consideration the exceptions which appeared in the Poor Law Reform Bill,s.g. cases in which the relief did not  exceed Q J * weeksduring the year, etc.      It may be argued that this method will involve a violation of the principles of tho Ballot Act under whichevery person on tho register is entitled to receive a ballot paper, but the argument does not seem of much importance.                                     iThe scheme proposed would be quite easy to work.      Clause 9.   This Clause removes the anomaly in thopresent law that a widow cannot combine her late husband&apos;sand her own occupation for purposes of qualifications.   Theproposal will meet with general approval.
      Clauso 10.  The existing provision v;hioh preventsthe refund of the deposit mado by  elected candidates at a parliamentary election until he has taken his seat was apparently intended to cover the attendance of Irishmembers.   It is proposed to allow the deposit to bereturned immediately after tho election.   Thi3 proposals is not likely to be controvorsial.      Clause 11.   Deposits by candidates at local electionsare not at present required in Great Britain.   By recentlegislation of the Northern Ireland Government fi25 mustbe deposited for County and Borough Councils and  10 forother local authorities.      The present clause which is  based on the provisionrelating to parliamentary elections proposes a deposit of [  1 for County and County Borough elections and S      jfor all other elections except Farish Councils.   Thefigures to be inserted are left for decision.      The arguments for the proposal are that (1) it willdiscourage &quot;freak&quot; candidatures which sometimes causeunnecessary contests,  (2) it will discourage a person-standing in more than ono ward,  etc.  of the localgovernment district,  with the result that if he issuccessful in each,  further elections become necessaryr..and(3) it may in business wards encourage business men to stand where at present they are discouraged by frivolousopposition.   Against the proposal i&quot;  may be argued that not much evidence exists of any such widespread mischiefTas to call for this kind of legislation,  and that as,  inmany districts,  there is no particular desire to nerveon local bodies, difficulty is frequently experiencedthrough no candidates or an insufficient number beingnominated-,  deposits by deterring suitable candidates  arelikely to increase the number of abortive elections and
14th January,  1928.may also obstruct a sound working man candidate whileoffering no hindrance to the communist who would get  themoney from party funds.   On the whole I doubt the valueof the proposal and do not urge its insertion.      The clause will no doubt be strongly opposed.                                  W.J.H.
