Air Ministry,   16th January, 1928.JTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.  -                                               COPY  NO. ^ QCP. 2 (23).                              CABINET.             WITHDRAWAL OF INDIAN INFANTRY BATTftLIOIi FROM IRAQ.                 MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.        1.   When the situation in Iraq was under review by the Cabinet        on the 23rd November last, it was decided inter alia :-             &quot;That tho Secretary of State for Air should inform the          Cabinet of hi3 intention to withdraw the Indian Battalion          before taking steps to do so&quot;.   (Cabinet 57  (27),10).        2.   I may rercind my colleagues that at the time this decision        was taken the discussions with King Faisal and his Hinisters        had (temporarily, as it proved in the event) broken down.        The situation today is, of course, very different and the        Chief of the Air Staff has advised ne that, despite the present        difficulties in the south with the Akhwan, this battalion        can now be withdrawn.        5.   In the &quot;interests of economy it is essential that very-        early action be taken tc this end.   Accordingly, since in the        altered circumstances, subject to ray colleagues&apos; concurrence,        discussion in Cabinet appears unnecessary, I have informed the        Secretary of State for the Colonies that this unit can be        withdrawn at any time after the 1st February, the exact date        being a matter for arrangement with the Secretary of State for        India.             Unless, therefore, ray colleagues see any objection -  in        which event I would ask that I may be notified within the        next seven day3 - action on the above lines will proceed.                                                  S. H.
