This document  is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.                      Printed for the Cabinet, January, 1928.  SECRET.                                                                      Cow No.  3 0CP.  10  (28).                                THE CABINET.PROPOSAL  TO   WITHDRAW  THE  2ND  BN.  COLDSTREAM                        GUARDS  FROM  CHINA.  MEMORANDUM BY  THE  ACTING SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR WAR.    I subjoin a memorandum  by the  Chief of the Imperial General Staff in  which he -proposes to withdraw the 2nd Bn. Coldstream Guards  from Shanghai, and  bring it home Innat an early date, on account of the unsatisfactory state of health of the battalion.   This   6would leave in China one  other  Guards battalion (the 2nd Bn.  Scots Guards), which isnow stationed at Hong Kong.    I am  aware that the Mayors  of leading Canadian cities have expressed the hope thatthe Guards might be brought home through  Canada, but, as  pointed out in the memo-randum, the journey across Canada should not properly be undertaken before the middleof April, and I do not wish to defer the move of this unit so long.  Moreover, the  route through Canada would be much more expensive than that vid the  Suez  Canal.  Even ifCanada undertook to pay the difference, any such arrangement would require negotiation,and involve delay,  which  should be avoided  in view  of  the state  of  health of the battalion.    I therefore trust that my colleagues will  agree to  the proposal of the  Chief of theImperial General Staff.                                                            JOHN GILMOUR.  THE WAR OFFICE,      23rd January, 1928.    1. The General Officer Commanding, North China Command, has found it necessaryto make a special  report on the state of health of the 2nd Bn. Colclstream Guards.  Forsome months the sick rate of this battalion has been considerably higher than that of anyother, and in  August, 1927, the ratio of sick was 177 a 1,000 as against&apos; 105*8 for thegarrison as a whole.    The General Officer Commanding attributes  this abnormal  sick rate to the averageage of the men (21^- years), which is  below the average of  other battalions and is due tothe fact  that the majority of Guardsmen are on short service engagements.   No furtherdrafts are being sent for this battalion.    2. The following are the alternative remedies to the present state of affairs :     (a)  The  2nd  Bn.  Colclstream  Guards  to  be sent to India and relieved  by a           British battalion from there.  The health of the battalion would probably not           benefit from the climate of India.  This alternative would also dislocate the           relief programmes.    (b)  The  2nd  Bn.  Coldstream  Guards to  be brought  home without  relief.   The           battalion is now at Shanghai, and if it is still considered  necessary to retain 5           battalions  at Shanghai, the  2nd Bn. Coldstream Guards could be relieved by           one of  the reserve battalions at Hong  Kong.    3. Of the two alternatives I consider (b) to be preferable, and am of opinion that afurther reduction of the  Shanghai Defence Force to this extent could now be carried out without risk.   I therefore recommend that orders  be now  issued  for this  battalion  toreturn home.    (B18/17) 100 1/28 W.OP.  3477
    4. Should my recommendation contained  in  paragraph 2 (b) he approved, there aretwo alternative routes                                (a)  Via Canada.                               \b)  Vid Suez Canal.    The  selection  of the  Canadian  route  entails an  expenditure  of  approximately 46,000, which  includes the refitting of the &quot; Assa3&apos;e,&quot;  now in Far Eastern waters, forpassage across the Pacific and its subsequent return to the Far East.   The journey acrossCanada should not begin  before the middle of April at earliest on account of climate.    The  Suez  Canal route entails an expenditure of  approximately  27,000,  which includes  the  refitting of the &quot; Assaye &quot; and dispensing with that ship on arrival  home.A further expenditure of  20,000 would be necessary if  it were decided to send back the&quot; Assaye &quot; to the Far East.  I consider the presence of this ship in the  Far East either asa transport or hospital ship to be no longer necessary.    The &quot; Assaye&quot;  in the Far East is at present costing . 12,000 a month.    5. To sum up, I recommend and request approval for the following :     (a) The 2nd Bn. Coldstream Guards, to return home.    (b) The route to be via the Suez Canal.     (c) The transport &quot; Assaye &quot;  to  be  used and dispensed with on completion  of the           voyage.12th January, 192S.
