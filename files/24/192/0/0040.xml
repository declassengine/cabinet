[This Document  is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]   231              Printed for  the Cabinet.  February 1928.SECRET.                                                    Copy  No.  30CP. 40 (28).CABINET.IRISH  LOYALISTS.    THE Chancellor of the Exchequer is of opinion that the Cabinet, in consideringthe Memorandum (CP. 38 (28)) by the Lord Privy Seal on Irish Loyalists, shouldhave before  them the  terms  of the communication addressed by the  Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs on the 17th September, 1926, to  Sir Alexander WoodRenton.  The relevant passage is  therefore  circulated  herewith.    Treasury Chambers, S.W.        February 11,  1928.        Extract from Letter of September 17, 1926, from Mr. Amery to                         Sir Alexander Wood Renton.    You will see from the Committee&apos;s Report that their view is that, in  dealingwith this post-Truce problem, the Government should abandon (without altogetherlosing sight of) the legal  standard by reference to which the Compensation (Ireland)Commission  worked, and should have primary regard to the degree of hardshipinvolved in each individual case, whether or not such hardship would formerly haveentitled the sufferer to compensation.  The Government, however,  have no means ofknowing, until the work  of the Committee is completed or nearly completed,  what isthe extent of the hardship with which the)&apos; will have to deal, and  they have not felt justified  in committing the British  taxpayer to an indefinite liability. they propose, therefore, that  the function of  the Committee should be (as,  indeed, theDunedin Report recommends) not to make awards, as the Compensation Commissionin effect did, but to advise the Government; and the Government  by no means bindthemselves to act on that  advice.   We shall have in our minds a limit of expenditure,beyond which we are not prepared to go;  and if the total of the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations (which, of course, will not be  published,  at any rate at the time they aremade)  exceeds this  amount,  the  Government will find it necessary  to adjust thepayments made in each individual case accordingly.    This will involve that no pajmient will be made until the Committee has so farcompleted its task as to enable a fairly  close estimate to be made  of their totalrecommendations; but it would, of course, be open to the Committee to recommendin individual  cases, where the need is urgent, that an advance should be made to thesufferer.    For your own private information I may say that the Cabinet has decided that 400,000&apos; is the absolute  maximum which can be provided to meet the recommenda-tions of the Committee, and it hopes that this figure may not be reached.  In the firstinstance we propose to ask Parliament to vote  150,000 during the current financialyear.[17207]
