THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNS      SECRET.      -                                   COPY NO.     30                             CABINET.CP. 14 (23).          EXPENDITURE ON PUBLICITY FOR THE BRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR.             Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.            In the financial year 1925/26 His Majesty^ Government,       in response to urgent representations of the exhibitors,       made a grant of  25,000 to be spent mainly in publicity for       the British Industries Fair.  This grant has been repeated       for the 1927 and 1928 Fairs,  It has been administered by       the Department of Overseas Trade, acting in consultation       with a committee representing the London and Birmingham       sections of the Fair,   Approximately two-thirds of the       grant is spent on publicity abroad, and the remaining one-       third on publicity for the Fair at home,            There can be no question that the publicity which it       has been possible to undertake has  largely contributed to       the increasing success of the Fairs In recent years.  The       numbers, both of overseas and home buyers, who attended the       Fair have increased largely, each year showing a substantial       increase over the year before.  An even more reliable       indicator of the success attending the British Industries       Fair is the steady increase in the amount of space taken up       by manufacturers, as the following figures show:-                                    Net exhibiting space let.                               (Total of London &amp; Birmingham Fairs)                                            Sq. Feet.                     1926 ................   224,874                     1927 ................   300,258                     1928 ................   429,700*          *The London section is lull,  and the Birmingham Section             has only a few thousand feet to let,
     In view of the fact that the publicity which It hasbeen possible to give to the Pair has had such excellent results there would have seemed to be good grounds for thecontinuance of the grant.  The Treasury, however, intimatethat they are unable to make further provision for thepurpose in the vote of the Department of Overseas Trade. Thisdecision is certain to prejudice seriously the success ofthe British Industries Fair, unless the necessary provisionfor publicity can be made in some other way.  Apart from theserious psychological effect of the entire withdrawal of thoGovernments support, there can be no question that adequateadvertising is vital to the success of any business under-taking, especially an undertaking of the fair or exhibition type.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer has proposed to theCabinet that the Treasury should be relieved of finding adirect grant of  25,000 and that this sum should be found from the funds of the Empire Marketing Board.  As I informed the Cabinet at the time, I think this is a fair and reason-able proposal. It will not be contended that the MarketingBoard have not ample funds at their disposal.  The Boarditself is an exhibitor at the London Fair, and the best sitehas been placed at its disposal.  Australia, New Zealand,South Africa and India are represented in the Board&apos;s stall&apos;,as well as a number of colonies, *and Canada and the IrishFree State have separate exhibits.  Moreover, if the marketing Board is to keep the good-will of manufacturers inthis country I am sure they will be well advised to make  thisdonation.  I am constantly receiving strong representations from manufacturers all over the country that it is unfair thatvast sums should be spent by the Government in promoting  thesale of Empire products in this country, *vhile no similar sumsare provided to assist the&quot; British manufacturers to pushtheir sales in the Empire.  If the Government grant to the
London and Birmingham Fairs were withdrawn, and the empire marketing Board refused to fill the gap, I am sure thatBritish manufacturers would deeply resent it and that therewould be a real opposition to the continuance of the Board&apos;scampaigns.  I therefore ask the Cabinet to confirm theChancellor1s proposal and their provisional decision of the15th December.     The only alternative suggestion is that the necessary funds should be found by Increasing the charge for space toexhibitors.  This, however, is not possible.  The presentcharges are 2/6d. per square foot in London and 3/- persquare foot in Birmingham.  An extra charge of 6d. per squarefoot would on the basis of this yearrs figures bring in arevenue of less than  11,000.  It is also quite possible thatsuch an increase in the charge would reduce the amount of space taken by exhibitors, thus causing a set-back to the Fair.Any extra charge for space intended to provide the full sum required for publicity purposes would, in the expressedopinion of the London and Birmingham Exhibitors1 Committees&quot;inevitably destroy the Fair&quot;.     Moreover, while the Department of Overseas Trade can, ifnecessary, control the management of the London Fair, theyhave no such power over Birmingham, which is autonomous inconstitution and independent in spirit.                                    P. C-L.Board of Trade,   24th January, 1928.
