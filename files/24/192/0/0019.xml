-^AJ^STY 1 S GOVEinkig:!) .?.19(28) .COPY NOC A 3 I27 E T.AMENDLiElIT 01-&apos; THE PARLIAMENT ACT.ilOTE BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR.     I und9rstand that the Cabinet will shortly be considering the course to be adopted on the subject of whatis called Rouse of lord Reform, and I venture to circulate the following observations for their consideration:-     It appears to me that there are strong reasons infavour of taking a step forward during th.6 coning Session.The Secretary of State for India, in the debate in the Houseof Lords on the RSnd June last, said that it was theintention of the C-r vernment to deal with the matter in the lifetime of the present Parliament; and since that timethe proposals of the Government have been emphaticallyapproved by the National Union Conference at Cardiff, at.vhich a resolution vaa passed by a large majority urging the Government to Introduce a measure on the subject inthe session of 1923.  If nothing is now done, it will besaid that we have not the courage of our opinions, andwe shall lose ground.     Ho doubt there are difficulties in introducing a Billunder the conditions now existing.  It would be said (withsome truth) that, while the Asquith Government of 1911had a clear mandate from the electors for passing the parliament Act, we have no such mandate for its amendment;
and the 3111 would meet with violent recistsr-ce from boththe Opposition parties.  The session is already deeplymortgaged to the Franchise Bill and other measures,  andit might provo impossible to carry an additional measureof the first importance without a prolonged autumn Session.uut nevertheless it may be right to make the attempt.     A possible alternative to the introduction of a Sillwould be to follow the precedent of 1911, and to introduce in both Houses a Resolution or series of Resolutionsdefining precisely tho proposals of the Government,  witha view to their being endorsed by the electors at the next general Election.  Uo doubt the eiTect of this procedure would be that t,he question would be widely discussed at thoElection? but on the other hand there i3 some advantage intaking a course which would prevent misrepresentation ofour proposals and which would show that we have sufficientconfidence in our case to submit it to the judgment of thecountry.     whichever of the above two courses be approved, Ithink that the Bill or the Resolution (or Resolutions)should provide for- the amendment of the Parliament Act -          (l) by enacting that tho quostion whether a     Bill is or is not a i-Ioney 3111 within the meaning of     the Act shall be determined by a Joint Standing     Committee of both Houses, and that in coming to a     decision on that point the Committee shall have regard     not only to the form but to the substanoo and effect     of the Bill, and          (8) by enacting that the provisions of the     Parliament Act under which a Bill other than a Honey     Bill which has been three times passed by the House
     or Commons may without the consent of the House of     Lords bo presented for the Royal Assent shall not     apply to any Bill which alters the constitution or     powers of the house of Lords as established by Law     unless between the first passing of tho Sill by the     House of Commons and its third passing by that House     a General Election shall have intervened.It would be a waste of time to deal v/ith the first of thesequestions without also dealing with the second, which is offer greater importance.  I assume that the Cabinet willadhere to its decision against the Referendum.     I have not included in the above list the proposal that Bills dealing; with local rates shall not be held to fall within tho category of financial provisions, and thatthe House of Lords shall have power to deal with matters affecting local rates, because this proposal is connected,not with the Parliament Act, but with the privileges of theHouse of Commons, and it night be better to deal with that question separately by referring it to a Committee.  Thepractice on this branch of privilege is at the- presenttime uncertain ana confused, and it is very desirable thatit should be defined.     There remains the question whether the Bill orResolutions should deal with the constitution of tho Houseof Lords.  The sketch proposals under this head which were put forward by the Government in June last were to someextent intended to conciliate those who thought that theproposed amendments of thj Parliament Act would give too much power to the House of Lords as now constituted; butin fact they appeared to conciliate nobody and met withstrenuous opposition, not only from some Conservatives,
but from members cf both the Opposition parties,  whoseemed to profor the House of Lords as it now is.  Inthese circumstances it is a matter for consideration whether it would be better to postpone any action onthis part of the Government proposals to a future date in doing so we should be following the precedent  set in 1911, when the Government of that- day dealt only withe powers of the House of Lords and deferred to  a futdate (which has not yet arrived) any amendment of theconstitution of the Second Chamber.                                    C.27 January 1923.
