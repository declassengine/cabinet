SECOND RBPOBT.                 Bofore the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster            eoes to Geneva for the forthcoming meetings in connection            with Security and Disarmament ho has asked the Committee            to pass in review some of the conclusions of the reportd           of November r rd, 1927, as adopted by the Cabinet.^ ReferenoeCabinet     The Committee on oecurity at Geneva will meet on58 (27) Con-conclusion 3,  February 20th to be succeeded on March 5th by the Counciland C. ?.293 (27).    Itself, whilst the Preparatory Commission which deals            with the Disarmament side of the question will not meet            till liar eh 15th.   It is hoped that Lord Cushendun may            be back in England between the meetings of the Ccnmittee            and the Commission for further consultation hero on the            Disarmament side of the question.   But in any case whether            ha comes back or not the Cabinet will no doubt desire            to consider Disarmament more fully than Is possible            on the present occasion and  the part thei&apos;ofore of            this report which deals with that side of the question            should be treated as merely  provisional.                    I. SECURITY.          So far- as the broad outlines of theinstructions which have already been given to the
attached to a general scheme of disarmament.   They still thinkthat such a connection is desirable but the proposal has suchmerits, both substantial and tactical, that they are notprepared to make its connection with a general scheme of disarmament a sine qua non.     To sum up on the Security side of the question, theCommittee are of opinion that a sustained initiative on thelines they have indicated will have a double advantage.   It  -will furnish a complete answer to the charge that the attitudeof Great Britain is merely nogative, and It will attractsufficient attention at Geneva to push disarmament, when the meetings arrive at that point, at any rate to a certain extentmore into the background.   It need only be added that theCommittee considered a series of highly technical points re-lating to the application of the Covenant to arbitration and conciliation and arising out of the answers which have beenmade by ourselves and other Countries to the Questionnaire ofthe Preparatory Commission.   The Committee were of opinion thatthese must be left to Lord Cushendun to deal with as he thinksbest in the light of the general instructions the Cabinet willhave given him, it being understood that if he is in great doubtupon any point which he may consider of sufficient importancehe should refer It home for docisiono   In the meantime theChairman promised to confer with the advisers of the Governmentin the Foreign Office on the several points dealt with in the answers to the Questionnaire and to call the Committee together tconsider them if that course should seem desirable.                       II.  DISARMAMENT.     Provisional report.   Subject to further consideration.     There Is evidently no greater assurance now than therewas in November that a breakdown can be avoided.   If that
unhappily should to tht? care it is iimportant for thisCountry that tho bi*cak should take place rather upon themilitary than the naval side of the question, and it would follow therefore that instead of coming first as has hitherto been the practice it would suit us better that the militaryissues should come last.   Up to now the order has alwaysbeen Army, Navy, Air-.   Luckily it is upon the Air Serv cethat the nearest approach to one another amongst thePowers has taken place, and It would therefore not be unreasonable to suggest that it should be put forward atthe top of the agenda.   It would seem t.o follow, if that should prove acceptable, that the old order should be simplyreversed shich would not only bring the Air Service to thefirst place but would incidentally have the effect of putting the Army last.   &apos;:.&apos;e suggest that our representative should try to bring this about.   It should be noted that,though upon the Air Service the Powers have approached one another, further progress is at present blocked by thedifference between ourselves and other countries on thequestion of International control-   In regard .to thisqcestion however the Committee are not able to recommend any concession.     The Committee have had under their consideration two proposals by the Admiralty of possible alternatives to theposition taken up by them at the Three-Power Conference,, whichmight be put forward at the Preparatory Commission.   TheCommittee however have become increasingly anxiousas far as possible to prevent the reawakening of thecontroversies with Amoric.  of last year at this moment, andas at present advised they are not prepared to recommendeither of these alternatives..     In the first the principle of categories adopted In theBritish proposals of last year - in a reduced number ofcategories however - is maintained, though tho blank figuresof tonnage in each category are not filled in.                           -4-
 An approach, however is made  to the American and French position,  not indeed by accepting the  principle of total tonnage  for all craft or for all craft below the category of capital ships,  nor even by adopting simply the last French compromise  under which tonnage  is allotted between categories provided that it  could after notice be transferred to other categories,  but this compromise subject to the further  vital condition that the transfer should not take place  except  to a  less powerful  category.     The second alternative  was  merely to provide for a declaration by the several Powers  of the programme they  have adopted  for the next  five years, with  the addition that after  the  mutual communication of  these programmes they are enabled to sign a binding convention preventing each signatory  from making any increase  on  the programme so declared during the term of the convention.   On the  whole,  however, the Committee  were  of  opinion that neither  one alternative nor the other  is safe  from the risk  of leading  to a  fresh; altercationbetween  the British and the American representatives,  and giving the opportunity to unfriendly newspapers,  for electoraland other  domestic purposes  In America,  to compass  a disaterous efect upon the  more  healthy  public opinion  which Is  beginning to manifest itself in that country.   The Committee  feel  thatthe only attitudes  which in these circumstances  would be  safewould be to express regret that some of  the  proposals submitted  at the three  Power  Conference  did  not  find  favourand to content   cvrselves with putting forward the  suggestion as to capital ships,  their size, their age and their armament,which formed part  of  the British plan which  involved by far the greatest economy  of  all its items,  but whioh was neverproperly discussed, and, what is more important at as nevertreated as unacceptable  on its merits by the American delegates,
      Upon tho assumption that our rsprecontativo would ba successful In securing tho reversal in tho agenda of the old oi-dor cf the  three rervloer;  we come last to tho military issues.    The Commit tes have discussed those in the light of eo:-7..&quot;er sat ions which the Foreign Secretary and Lord Cu3hendun have had with the French Ambassador and of  discussions which took plaoe between the Military experts cf the two Powers at Geneva..      From a careful consideration of those convevsations the Conmittse believe  that the French Government will never consent to  tho limitation  of their Reserves,    The case  for  them which is put forward depends not  merely upon the necessities cf national defonco but upon the idea that universal service  embodies in the  army the democratic spiritc This  ssems to be  ineradicable  not  merely from French but broadly speaking from  Continental  public opinion.    The Committeeg  how3ver,  or 3  satisfied  that it Is not on democrat: grounds but cn military grounds  that  the French Government an  reality cling to  this  position  and. sir.ee  if  in the cvont of  a  breakdown of  the  Conference we  are driven  to find tho softest  place  upon which to  fall  and the French military difficulty appears to be  the best  available,  we  mus-i try and bring  the real motive  of that  Goverr.rn.cnt home to tlie-ru In  this copies tier, the  Corcmlttee have reflected  that thoughuniversal military service may be  defensible  on  d3moc3;ratio instead cf military grounds the presence  of  the  large  surplus of  officers and non-commissioned officers which  the  French.entertain for mobilisation purposes cannot be explainedexcept upon mobilisation grounds *   The  Committee thinktherefore that if we are bound to witness th3 breakdown ofthe conference, our representative should be armed withthis argument, in order in as friendly language as possibleto force the responsibility of this res^alt upon the Frenchand upon the insincerity of their support of real disarmament
     The  Gonsnltt.ee  consider  that  It  would ho of greatuse, not  merely to  our representative  at  Gcnsva, hut to ministers and other  speakers at home,,  If  the full Sf.opc of theactual Disarmarjsnt proceedings In this country wareprecisely 3et out by the Departments concerned and theyhave requested that  memoranda should be preparedaccordingly,,                     Signed on behalf of the  Committee,                              SALISBURY,                                     (Ciiairnan)o2, Whitehall Gardens., S0W.l.
