In oontinuation of CP. 307 (27) and with referenceto the Cabinet decision of the 7th December (Cabinet 60 (27)Conclusion 4) I circulate copies of a despatch and semi-official letter sent to the Free State with the PrimeMinister&apos;s approval on the 20th of January, together withcopies of a despatch and semi-official letter dated the9th February whioh have now been received in reply.     It will be seen that the Free State have agreed topay the taxed costs as between party and party incurred by or on behalf of tho plaintiffs in the case ox the twotransferred civil servants (I-Iessrs. Wigg and Cochrane)which came before the Judicial Committee.   This proposalto pay party and party costs follows the practice adoptedhere in somewhat similar cases, i.e., those arising out ofthe Sutton judgment.     It will be noted also (paragraph 4 of tho despatch)that the Free State contemplate that an agreement should bemade between the two uovernments in this matter.  They have promised to forward a draft of their proposals, and also of their proposed Eill and we need not, I think, go further into this point until their drafts are received.      The ouestion on which an immediate decision ienecessary is that of an announcement.  The Free state urge,and the Treasury who have been consulted agree with methat an immediate announcement outlining the generalpolicy is essential.  The terms of the proposed announcement
24 LIas set out in the Free State despatch have been carefully examined and I think we may safely acceptthe general tenor of the announcement as  satisfactory,     As the semi-official letter of the 9th of Februarpoints out, the proposed announcement does not refer to the attitude of the Government here, but it will beseen from that letter that if pressed on  the matter the Free State Minister of Finance proposes to say thathe Government here, subject to agreement in the detalof the proposed legislation, have Intimated that thoywould be prepared to gi&quot;e their concurrence and co-operation in the general policy out lineie     It is, I think, des ire-hie that we should.iake an announcement here of our attitude if notnecessarily sImultaneoucly at any rate very srortlyafter the Free State announcement e    )     I wo&quot;ald propose therefore, if my colleagues agree, to send a reply to the Free State  despatch,if possible on Wednesday, the 15th February,indicating that we agree generally In tho terms ofthe proposed announcement, that we think  It desirablealso to make an announcement oiu1 selves, and that itis contemplated, therefore, on the assumption that anannouncement will be made in the Free State onThursday, the 16th or preferably Friday, the 17th,to announce In Farlia.:a nt here on Monday, the 20th,that Ills Majesty&apos;c Government in Groat britain were informed in advance of the announcement which His

IRISH FREE STATE.NOc24,Downing Street,  20 January- 1928,       Sir,            I have the honour to state that your despatches       No.291 of the 9th November and No.539 of the 23rd       December on the subject of the payment of compensation       to Civil Servants under Article 10 of the Articles of       Agreement of the 6th December, 1921, have been under the       consideration of His Majesty^ Government in Great       Britain.       2U   The questions involved have req\ilred careful       examination but I am new able to state that His -Majesty :s       Government In Great Britain accept the view that It would       not be equitable that the transferred Civil Servants       should receive more favourable treatment In the matters       In question than if they had remained In the civil service       of this country, and after fully reviewing all the       circumstances they will accordingly be prepared, subject to       information in greater detail as to the linos of the       legislation which His Majesty :s Government In the Irish       Free State have in contemplation, to give their       conexur-rence and co-operation in the general policy outlined       in your despatch of 9th November,       3.   One important- point which will need decision       relates to the question of the reimbursement of theThe Minister for External Affairs,      IRISH FREE STATE,
expenditure incurred by cr cn behalf of the persons concerned as plaintiffs in the case of Wlgg andCochrane versus &apos;the Attorney-General of the IrishFree State.   His Majestyfs Government in GreatBritain would v.ish to oonrno&apos; d this question to thesympathetic consideration of His Majesty*s Governmentin the Irish Free State.4,   A further point which requires consideration is that of the moet appropriate time for a public announcement.   His Majesty1?. Government in GreatBritain fully realise the desirability of such anannouncement at the earliest practicable date, butthey feel that misunderstandings are likely to arise if a public statement is made before the question ofthe action to be taken has bnnxi examined in furtherdetail and agreed.             I hive the honour to be,                     Sir,              Your most obedient humble servant-(for the Secretary of State)      (Signed)  LOVAT,
.0./D.285/28,                                          Downing  Street,                                             20 January,  1928,  Dear  Kr,  Murphy,        V.&apos;Ith reference  to our official  despatch No,2d  of  today*s  date  regarding  tho question of the Irish Treaty Pensioners,  you will  notice that,  in effect,  it  asks that we  should see  in  draft, at the earliest possible opportunity,  the  form  of  legislation  proposed by the Free  State,  and  I hope  -that it will be  possible  to  arrange  this.    It would be  convenient,  If  practicable, that the  draft Eill  should be sent to  us  privately  in advance of any official communication on  the subject.        Perhaps I might take  this opportunity to enclose  copies  of the stenographic,  report of  the Deputation which,  as  you will  have  heard,  Lord Lovat received on the  29th  November from the  Irish Treaty Pensioners Association.    v.&apos;e  shall no  doubt  be  again  approached before long by  the  Association, and  shall have to  devise a  form of Interim reply,   We are assuming,  of  course,  that  any  statement of  policy will be agreed  between the two  Governments, and any such  statement  should,  we  think,  Include  the decisions reached  as to the question of  plaintiffs 1 costs  referred  to  In paragraph 4 of  our despatGh.   v7e  attach importance  to this point as I do  not  think that oxxr Ministers  could  support  the taking of action by the Free  State which would  deprive the  plantiffs of the results of their legal  proceedings  unless the  Free  State were at the same time-  to reimburse them  the  expenditure  which they have incurred.                                 Your si very truly,                                            (Signed) F.H.  BATTERBES.

His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish FreeState note that His Majesty&apos;s Government in GreatBritain accept the view that it would net beequitable that transferred Civil Servants shouldreceive mere favourable treatment in the matters Inquestion than if they had remained in the british civil Service, and that, subject to information in greater detail as to the lines of the legislation which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free Statehave in centemulation, His majesty1s ecvernment inGreat Britain are prepared to give their concurrenceand co-operation in the general policy outlined inmy Despatch of the 9th November last.     3.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish FreeState are willing to reimburse tho taxed costs a3e Right Honourable The&quot; Secretary of State for    Dominion Affairs,        Downing Street,          London,  S.  W. 1.
between party and party incurred by or on behalf oftho persons concerned as plaintiffs in the cuoo cfV/igg and another vorsus the Attorney General of theIriah Free State.   The plaintiffs&apos; Solicitors havealready been paid their costs of the trial of thoaction and of the Appeal to tho Supreme Court.     4.  A Bill to give effect.tc the general policyreferred to is in course cf preparation.    HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the Irish free State are advised t;.at it is essential that the prcr-csed Billin so far as its provisions will conflict with theepiniens expressed by the Judicial Committee of the privy Council should be preceded by an Agreementbetween His majesty&apos;s Government in ^roat Britainand His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State,and it is proposed that the will will containprovision for the ratification of such Agreement.A very early opportunity will be afforded His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Great Britain to consider the proposed bill and the suggestions cf His ,iajesty&apos;s governmentin the Irish Free Stats as to the terns of the saidAgreement between the two Governments.   It isproposed also that the draft of the said Bill togetherwith the proposed Heads of Agreement will bo submittedto His ..ajesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain for theirnonei de rat i on.
     5.  Since tho receipt of your Despatch tv:o actionsinstituted by applicants under Article 10 have boonheard in the High Court and a number cf other actions of a similar nature are ponding or threatened.   Inthese circumstances, his Majority1s Government in theIrish Free btats feel that it is imperative that apublic announcement should bo made at once and they suggest that, pending the further examination of pointscf detail, such an announcement should take the formcf a general indication of the policy agreed uponhot we or. tho two Governments.   Subject to any observationswhich Mis Majesty1^ Government in Great Britain maydosiro to make in the matter it is proposed that theannouricone-nt should be in the following terms: --          Tho Government have had under oensideration          tho opinions expressed by the Judicial         jM;j   :i i!  !; [  j&apos;H   If:;          :  j  )            ;&apos;!          Committee of the Privy Council in the oase          of V/igg and another versus the Attorney          General.               The Government are desirous of honouring          to the fullest extent their obligations under          Article 10 of the Treaty.   It is clear,          however, that some cf the opinions expressed          by tho Judicial Committee in the case          referred to would, if given effect to, result          in mere favourable treatment under Article 10          of the Treaty being accorded to transferred          exf ioors in tho matter of bonus than they          would have received Mad they remained in the
British Civil Service or than transferredofficers who eloct to remain in the Civil Sorviceof the Saorstat would receive on ultimateretirement in normal course under the Supor-annuation Acts,  Such a result was not intendedby Article 10 of the Treaty.     The Executive Council have accordinglydecide! to introduce into the Gfreachtas at theearliest practicable date proposals for logisla-tion providing that awards of compensation already made by the Minister for Finance on therecommendation of the Committee which was preside over by Mr, Justice wylie shall be binding in law.The legislative proposals will include aprovision for the setting up of a StatutoryCommittee, constituted somewhat on the lines of thedefunct Committee, whose duty it will be toadjudicate upon all pending and future claims under Article 10.  The determination of thisCommittee on any application or question referredto them will be final and conclusive.In assessing compensation the Committee will b9required to adhere in the treatment of bonus to thebasis applicable to officers in the British CivilService immediately prior to the transfer of theofficei^s to the service of the ProvisionalGovernment.     The Government are prepared to reimbursethe taxed costs as between party and partyincurred by or cn behalf of the perronsconcerned as plaintiffs in thy case of Wigg and
      and another versus the Attorney General,  but      they desire it to be known that any persons      pursuing litigation in the Courts aft9r this      date in regard to claims under Article 10 will      do so at their own risk.  It is intended that      provision will be made in connection with      pending actions in the propose-! legislation.     3.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish FreeState feel sure that His najesty&apos;s Government in GreatBritain will accord their concurrence in the course proposed.  It is desirable, for the reasons stated, thatthe announcement should be made when the Bail meetsnext week,and His Majesty&apos;s Governmetit in the IrishFree State will accordingly be obliged if theconcurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britaincan be communicated, if possible, by telegraph, not later than aonday,  the 13th instant.

Deal-  Sir Harry Batterbee,                Thanks for your  letter of the&apos; 20th January          regarding  tho question of the Irish Treaty Pensioners.          We are  sending you an official reply to-day to your          despatch of 20th January.                You will notice  that in his statement to the          Dail  the minister for Finance is not referring to the          attitude of the British Government in this matter.  He          expects however that  he will be questioned on this          point,  and in that event, he proposes to state that our          Government had been in communication with the British          Government and that the latter, subject to agreement          on details of the contemplated legislation, had          intimated that they would be prepaz*ed to give their          concurrence and co-operation in the general policy          outlined.                We will send ycu. privately at the earliest          possible moment a copy of the draft Bill.                The minister for Finance wishes to make          hie statement when the Dail reassembles on Wednesday,          15th  instant, and he  is extremely anxious to have          the reply of your Government by Monday, the 13th.          We should be grateful for your good offices in          expediting the reply.                                   Yours sincerely,                                  (Signed)   SEAN MURPHY.ir H.P.Jatterbea.                                   -12-
