(THIS DOCUEENT IS THE PROPERTY OF ItIS 5RITA^i:IC KAJE3TY&apos;S GOVEP.NLIENT) .SECRET.                                            COPY NO.CP. 58 (28).                         CABINET.                        IRISH LOYALISTS.                ileaoranuum by the Lord privy Seal.            It is evident thore i3 about  to be a debate in both       Houses  of Parliament as to the action which is to be taken upon       the Irish Loyalists claims.   It has therefore been my duty       to consider carefully the attitude we ought to adopt.            It will be remembered that in December though the Cabinet       wore willing under the scale that  was applied to the German Air       Raid victims to raise the tota.1 figure from  400,000 which they       had originally fixed to some  650,000,  they vrere not oropared       tc award the  900,000 to which the recommendations of the Wood       Renton  Commission,  working upon the Report of Lord Dunedin&apos;s       Committee,  amounted.            It i3 of course true that the Wood Ronton Commission were       told cf the limit  of  400,000, but they conceived themselves       as a judicial body whose plain business was to carry out the       terms of their reference, subject  only  to the interpretation       of the  British Government1s obligations according to the Report       of Lord Dunedin&apos;s  Committee which  admittedly went beyond the       actual  terms of tho old Irish Criminal  Injuries Code.   What       might happen to their recommendations afterwards was no affair       of theirs,   They would have considered it a grave dereliction       of duty to deflect their judgment  of what was right by       considerations of  the total involved.   But after a long       conversation with  Sir A. wood Renton I  am satisfied that his       Commission were most careful in their reading.of the terms of                                      -1-
reforenco and that in seme respects thoy set very narrowlimits to the cla-o of claims they would admit.     The question for the Cabinet is,  ought the decision ofDecember to be reconsiderad?     Notwithstanding tho original limit imposed by the Cabinet,as my colloaguea are aware,  when we considered the question inDecember, I did not think that it was defensible to go behindtho effect of Dunedin&apos;s interpretation as between tho BritishGovernment and the victims whom in 1 21 they considered themselves by the necessities of the case obliged to abandon.   Even theappoar\;...nce of striking a hard bargain seemed to me to berepellent, and when it was remembered that the carefully-siftod claims of the victims had behind them the authority ofa British Judge and of an impartial Committee I thought it tobe impossible.     Here is an example which a correspondent has sent to me.In this case  1,900 was recommended by the Grants Committee but under the Government scale only  39$ has been awarded.   As 500 had already been advanced and more than the balance of  395is outstanding by way of loan repayable to the Government, thisclaimant will g-^t nothing mere.   let this was the case of aman who in the troubles had boon one of the sourses cfinformation to the military against the rebels.   This fact had become revealed by an indiscretion, and partly for this reasonand partly as a reprisal for the killing of a Catholic Priestby tho &quot;Black and Tans&quot;, the claimant1s death had been decreed andhe fled to England and has had to begin his life all over again.     Koro is another.   This man was a Land Agent.   Ko wasController of Recruiting during the war and had other quasi-military work of watching tho coast on a large scale entrusted to him.   In furtherance of this uork ho paid  1,000 out of hisown pocket.   His wife ran a canteen:   his daughters helped atthe Hospital:  his son was killed in action.   In 1923 he &amp;acthis wife were torn from their beds by armed rebel3 and the house was lootod and burnt.   Ke lost an income of  3,000 a year
- o-besides other considerable expenses and his v;ifo&apos;s health was affected.   For this loyalist tho. Claims Committee recommendedcompensatioii of  8,050, no more than that, but under the scale he isonly to receive  2,740.     Such claims, if accurately stated, are overwhelming.   Uy Conviction morsovex&apos;,  that the decision of December must not be treated asfinal is greatly strengthened by finding that though the figure ofthe recommendations of the Grants Committee was not at the time ofhearing communicated to the claimants, yet in some cases where hisdistress warranted it the fact that the claimant was successful was told to him and upon the strength of this he v;as able to raisemoney,  tho security for which i3 destroyed by the decision of theGovernment.   But the case for reconsideration iff ^stronger eventhan ail this.    As I have 3aid, the Dunedin interpretation of our obligations was avowedly broader than the actual terms of the oldIrish Code.   In Docombor it was pointed out in the Cabinet that ourpledge was primarily to be found in a passage in the communicationmads by nr. Churchill on behalf of the oritish Government to theProvisional Government of Ireland cn July 26th lp22 :-         n/hile however the responsibility for me etfn 3 theso claims        &quot;to compensation must rest upon the Irish Government His        &quot; najesty1s government cannot divest themselves of a duty        &quot;to see that such claims are met equitably and as promptly        &quot;as inevitable difficulties allow&quot;ithough as a matter of fact this was reinforced by the Dulre cfDevonshire speaking cn behalf of i*r;. Bonar Law&apos;s Government onDecember 4th 1922;--        11 We have an equal responsibility, reference to whioh has        &quot;been made in the course of those debates, in relation to        &quot;compensation, land purohaso, and the position of servants        &quot;of the Crown.   It is for us who have accepted that        &quot;responsibility to see that full and ample justice is        &quot;rendered in all cases&quot;.
But upon JLr. Churchill&apos; a statement that I have quoted it was argued in the Cabinet that we are only bound to givecompensation for injuries according to the terns of the oldIrish law and not according to the Dunedin broaderinterpretation.  As to this last it was said that theGovernment are entitled to exercise a discretion and to scaledown tho recommendations of the Wood Renton Committoe on the analogy of the awards to the German Air Raid victims.     In the first place the analogy seems to me to bedefective.  There was no promise of any kind, susceptibleeither of broader or narrower interpretation, to the Air Raidvictims; there v/as no bitterness of public obloquy; there wasno expatriation from their homes, and no necessity to restarttheir lives over again.  But in the second place, admittingfor a moment that we are not bound by the Dunedin broaderinterpretation, I would point out what was not brought beforethe Cabinet in December but what subsequent consideration hasmade abundantly plain, namely, that upon the rabst literalreading of the old Irish compensation law the scale of reductionupon which the Cabinet resolved constitutes a direct breach ofthe pledge of  1922.  This scale of course takes no account -and could take no account - of the circumstances of each case,except only the total amount of each recommendation.  Iinterpolate that in  all respects this is very hasty, as fromthe amount of  the award no conclusion can be drawn as to the hardship  suffered by the victim, and I mark  this as beingunjust and as  being  by itselx&apos; a signal blemish in  the decisionof December,   out the vital point  is that the  scaling downapplies  just  as much to  the compensation  for the injurieswhich  were  cognisable by  the  old Irish law  as  by the broaderinterpretation of our  obligations  accepted  by  the  Dunedin
RGport, and to do justice in the former wo areabsolutely bound.  Hero are one or two &quot;illustrationsfurnished by the Dominion Office.     Lirs,Woods,  This claimant&apos;s father and brother weredragged from her house, made to dig their graves and thenmurdered.  Under the old Criminal Injuries Act very substantial compensation.-would have been awardedD  TheFree State refused compensation, but in respect of them the Wood Renton Committee recommended a sura of  4000.Under our scale she will only get  1525.     i r. CIS, 0.1 ark.  The claimant&apos;s house was destroyed on the 2S111 March 1023,  It is estimated that the awardsunder the Criminal and Lialicious Injuries Act would have been in the neighbourhood cf  20,000.  Under the damage to Property Compensation Act 1923 of the Free State, a3the applicant was not prepared, having regard to thecircumstances in which he was obliged to leave Ireland,to rebuild ho was only awarded by the Irish authorities 3000.  The Wood Renton Committee made a recommendationof  5700,  Under the scale he will only get  2635.     Mrs - E,. hankey 11 on Brown.  Tho Bank in which her jewellwas stored was raided,  Under the eld Act she would havebeen entitled to compensation.  Under the Free StateAct she was awarded nothing.  The Wood Renton committee recommended  500.  Under our award she will only get     These cases could be multiplied.  In fact, althoughof course the larger number of compensation cases come under the broader Dunedin interpretation^ yet many of thecases which come within the moaning of the eld IrishAct are  subject to our reduction because they involvesums which arc largo in arjount.  The scaling down of
compensation for iiijuriea cognisable by the old Irishlaw I suggest Is a fatal objection.     I submit to the Cabinet that in these circumstances the decision of ia.;t December must be reconsidered.   AndI submit it upon four grounds:-     (i) that v;e cannot be less loyal to those who          stood by us than a British Judge and an          impart i al Commi a 3ion:    (ii) that in certain caeea the successful          applicants were enabled to raise money          upon thoir prospective awards which are          now to be no awards:   (iii) that from the amount recommended no valid          conclusion can be drawn that because it is          large the cs.se is one of loss hardship; and          lastly,    (iv) that the scale of reduction applies to          numbers of cases of compensation for          injuries cognisable by the old Irish law,          in regard to which we are absolutely bound          by the pledge of 1922.S.February  10 th, IS
