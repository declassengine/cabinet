j This Document  is the Property of  Hii  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.1             Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1928.                    131CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 22 (28).Copy  No.30MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR  FOREIGN                                AFFAIRS. THE   FRANCO-AMERICAN   DRAFT   PACT  OF  PERPETUAL   FRIENDSHIP  AND   THE     AMERICAN DRAFT OF AN ARBITRATION TREATY TO REPLACE THE ANGLO-AMERICAN     ARBITRATION TREATY OF 1908.     I CIRCULATE to my colleagues papers bearing on (1) the Franco-American negotiations for the  conclusion of a Pact  of Perpetual Friendship, and  (2) the American draft of an Arbitration Treaty which has just been  communicated  to us to replace the existing Root-Bryce Arbitration Treaty on its expiration  next June.     The two draft treaties are really quite distinct, and I therefore propose, for the sake of greater clarity, to treat them separately in the following explanatory statement:                    (1.) Draft  Treaty of Perpetual Friendship.     In April 1927 M. Briand, in a public  message to the United States, declared the  readiness  of  the French  Government to  sign  with  that  country a treaty &quot; outlawing war.&quot;   This rather vague declaration was, we are informed  by the French Foreign Office, received in America  by both political parties with a  success which had  surprised  M.  Briand  himself.    In order to  meet  the earnest  wish expressed in the first instance by the American press and public men, and secondly. by the American Ambassador at Paris, who  is stated to have been acting unofficially but under instructions, M. Briand drafted  a  short treaty of two articles whereby both  countries  agreed,  according to M.  Briand&apos;s phrase, to   outlaw war.&quot;   The draft treaty, the text of which will be found as Appendix I, was communicated to the United  States last summer by the American Ambassador at Paris.     Under  the  draft treaty  it was proposed that France  and the  United States should agree to &quot; condemn recourse to war and renounce it respectively as an  instru- nient of their national policy towards each  other.&quot;  The settlement  of disputes of whatever nature was &apos;&quot; never to be sought by either side except by pacific means.&quot;    While it is true that Mr. Borah and other influential personages in the  United States, together with a certain section of  the United  States press,  gave a warm welcome to  the  idea underlying the draft treaty, the reception accorded to it by the Administration was  from the  first exceedingly cool.   Embarrassed,  by the support given  to  the proposal by  a number of their adherents,  yet  unwilling to conclude  a treaty which, so far as the United States is concerned, might give France a free hand to pursue in Europe policies appearing aggressive in American eyes,  the United States Government did nothing at all in the matter until the end of December last.   On the 28th of that month Mr. Kellogg suddenly addressed to the French Ambassador at Washington a note in which he stated that his Govern- ment were prepared to accept M. Briand&apos;s draft,  provided that it Avas turned from a bilateral into a multilateral treaty to be signed by :&apos; the principal  Powers of the world &quot; and to be  &quot; open to signature by all nations.&quot;  It was suggested that the United States and  French  Governments should jointly submit such a  treaty to &quot; the other nations of the world.&quot;  It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the  abruptlaunching of this proposal, after the long delay  of nine months  since the Briand plan was first mooted,  has not been timed entirely without an  eye on the presidential election which takes place  next  November.  The  State Department gave the  widest possible publicity to the note almost before there had been time for it to reach thehands of the French Government.      4280   [17095]                                                   B
    To Mr. Kellogg^s note M. Briand replied accepting the idea that the treaty should be multilateral,  but suggesting (a) that it should  first be signed by Franceand the United States before being submitted to the other nations of the world, and(b) that the renunciation of war should apply to a &quot;&apos; war  of aggression &quot; only.  Onthe 11th January Mr. Kellogg handed to the French Ambassador  in  Washington anote in which he expressed  satisfaction  that M. Briand had  agreed to  make thetreaty a multilateral one,  but disagreed with his view  that it should  first be signed by the United States  and  France alone.  The note went on to express surprise thatM.  Briand  should  now desire to limit  the scope of the agreement to  &quot; wars of aggression,&quot; as this was not the case with the original French  draft.  Mr. Kelloggnow proposed that the treaty and the subsequent correspondence should lie comimmi-eatoU to the Governments of Great  Britain, Germany, Italy and  France  for their consideration  and  comment.  It  is  understood  that  the French Ambassador atWashington has verbally explained to Mr. Kellogg that,  the United States Govern-ment  having transformed the proposed treaty from  a bilateral  into  a  multilateralone, France was obliged to limit its effects to a &quot; war of aggression &quot; in order totake account of her treaty obligations in Europe.    1 may add that Mr. Kellogg,  in  the course of the conversations on the subject which he has had with our xVmbassador at Washington, admitted that  the  draft treaty did not really constitute an act that would *&apos; outlaw war,&quot;  but believed thatit went as  far as  public  opinion in  the United States would  allow at present.Mr. Kellogg did not understand why some French papers seemed  to think that theproposal for a multilateral treaty would be a blow to the League of Nations.  Thiswas not at all his intention.  His suggestion was really  in the nature of a declarationagainst war, which,  though abstract, would have great  moral value upon publicopinion  generally.  Mr.  Kellogg  insisted  that  he must bar any mention of an  aggressive war,&quot; as no satisfactory definition of an *&apos; aggressive nation &quot; had yetbeen found.    The  above is  a  brief  outline  of  the history  of these  negotiations.   for convenience of reference  the texts of the French and American  notes appear as appendix II.    ,    Turning to the text of the draft treaty, it will be seen that articles 1 and 2 onlyare of importance.                                    ARTICLE  1.         &quot; The higli contracting Powers solemnly declare, in the name of the French    people  and  the people of the United  States of America, that  they  condemn    recourse to war and renounce it respectively  as an instrument of their national    policy towards each other.&quot;    Everything seems to depend on  the precise meaning to be read into the phrase&quot; renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy.&quot;  There ought in theoryto be no difference between the sense in which the French Government use  the term  war  of  aggression &quot; and the sense in which the United States Government use the term  recourse  to war .... as an instrument of national policy.&quot;  In  practice,however,  there is in  the  American  mind a difference of interpretation,  since theUnited States Government have categorically refused to accept the definition &quot; war of aggression.&quot;    In attempting  to narrow the scope of the treaty to   wars of aggression,&quot; theFrench Government no  doubt have in mind war in general after the elimination ofthe three  exceptional  cases specified  in article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno.  By that article Germany and  France mutually undertook  not to resort to war except     (a.)  In exercise of the right to legitimate defence    (/;.)  Acting in pursuance of article lb&apos; of the Covenant.     (6-.)  Acting in pursuance of a decision of the Assembly or Council of the League,           or rn  pursuance of article 15, paragraph 7, of the Covenant,  provided           that, in this last event, the action is directed against the State which           was the first to attack.     The above exceptions appear to cover  the cases in which a State has to  go towar for reasons other than  in pursuit of a deliberate policy of its  own,  i.e., theycover  the cases  in  which  hostilities would  not  constitute  rendering  war an  instrument of the national policy.&quot;     If this is, indeed, the French view, there is  really not much difference betweenthe two  parties, but hitherto it has  passed the wit of  man to define &quot; aggression.&quot;
 It would not be easy, even it&apos; France and the United States agreed  that the ideas underlying their respective proposals were the same,  to find a formula reconciling France&apos;s need to  cover her commitments  under the Covenant with  the American need to exclude any recognition of the League as the body with whom  will  rest the ultimate decision  whether a  war is or  is not  &quot; aggressive.&quot;  To judge from the American press comment, America has not the slightest intention of binding herself in advance to accept a League decision on such a point.                                    ARTICLE 2.         &quot;The settlement or  the solution  of  all disputes or conflicts,  of whatever     nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise between France and     the  United States of America, shall never be sought by either side except  by     pacific means.&quot;     The  settlement of a dispute is never to be sought except  by pacific means. The draft Arbitration Treaty, to which  I  refer  below, cites a number of cases which are to be excluded from  the compulsory reference to arbitration.   The question therefore arises:  if such questions are not susceptible of settlement by arbitration and may yet not be subjected to the arbitrament of war, what machinery  is to  be set up for their elimination?   It would be  interesting to know the views of the authors of the proposed pact on this point.     The French Government have now asked  for an expression of our views on the text of  this treaty and on the exchange of notes, while the  American  Government have also communicated the documents to the  Foreign  Office  &quot; for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;  As the Franco-American negotiations show some signs of breaking  down,  it seems desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should avoid, if possible,  committing themselves at the present stage to any-definite expres- sion of opinion. Moreover, it  is not very clear  what practical  purpose the new7 treaty would serve, since no machinery is to be set up for dealing with questions which  at present  are held to be unsuitable for settlement by arbitration.  The only arguments in its favour which occur to me are  (1)  that it may, as Mr. Kellogg suggested in a conversation with  Sir Esme Howard, promote the formation  of &quot;world opinion for peace.&quot;  and (2) that it may tend to draw the United States away from the policy of complete isolation,  and may bring about a better understanding there of European problems, such as the reparations and debt questions.  This I am bound to admit is at present a  faint hope,  but a consideration of the American proposal suggests an enquiry as to what course the United States Government would propose to take if, after they had insisted  on making the treaty  multilateral, one  of  the signatory Powers  broke its  obligations in  respect  of a  third  party.    A  rebuff to the United States Government at  this stage may drive the Administration still  further into the isolationist camp.  On the other hand,  there are clangers inherent in the very vagueness and uncertainty of the phrase &quot; x-enunciation of war as an  instrument  of national policy.&quot;     In regard therefore to this instrument, it will be well to refrain from any definite expression of opinion at any rate until  the text of the forthcoming French  note  to the United States Government be known and considered.    (Since the above was written the text of the French note has been published in the &quot; Times,&quot; though it has not yet  been communicated to this  Office officially.   It is  stated to  have  been telegraphed to Washington on the 20th January and the relevant extract from the &quot; Times &quot; is printed in Appendix II.)   (2.) American Draft of an  Arbitration Treaty to replace the Anglo-American                          Arbitration Treaty of 1908.    Mr.  Iloughton,  in the course of an interview with me  on the 5th July last,drew attention to the fact that the Anglo-American Arbitration Treaty wouldexpire next June,  and enquired informally what  was likely to be the  attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter.  Would  they be prepared to renew this treaty?    I replied that I could  say  confidently, even without consulting mycolleagues, that we should be  most willing to renew the treaty.    In the ensuingconversation he made it clear that he merely wished to know, for the information ofhis Secretary of State, whether the treaty could be renewed in  its present form.We have therefore been proceeding on the assumption that the United States Govern-ment desired to renew the Root-Bryce Treaty in its existing form, and His Majesty&apos;s      [17095]                                                        n 2
Government  in  Great Britain have  been  in touch with  the various   DominionGovernments with a view to its renewal.    This was the position when, on the 29th December last, Mr. Kellogg addressed toSir E. Howard a note, in which he transmitted,  for  the consideration  of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and as a basis  for negotiation, the draft of a new Treaty ofArbitration to take the place of the treaty which expires next June (Appendix III).Mr. Kellogg stated that the language of his draft was mutatis mutandis identical with that of the draft treaty which he had transmitted on  the previous day to theFrench Ambassador for the consideration of  his Government.   It  may be observedthat the French Treaty of Arbitration  expires on the 27th February next, so that the&apos;necessity for an early conclusion of the negotiations is more pressing in their casethan in ours.    The French Government have communicated to us a text (Appendix IV) showingthe amendments to the American draft which they propose,  and which are shown initalics in the appendix. These amendments are discussed below under the relevantarticles of the treaty.    In order to permit a convenient comparison between the new American text andthe text of the Root-Bryce Treaty of 1908, the two texts have been placed side by side :  Draft Treaty of A rbitration submitted by    the United States Government.              Preamble.  The President of the United States ofAmerica and His Majesty the King ofGreat  Britain,  Ireland and the british dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor ofIndia, determined to prevent so far as intheir  power lies any interruption  in the peaceful  relations  that  have  happilyexisted between the two nations for morethan a century,  desirous of re-affirmingtheir adherence to the policy of submit-ting to impartial decision all justiciablecontroversies that  may  arise  betweenthem, and eager by their example not onlyto demonstrate their condemnation of war as an  instrument of national policy  intheir mutual relations, but also to hasten the time when  the perfection  of  inter-national arrangements for  the specificsettlement of international disputes shallhave eliminated  for ever the possibilityof war among  any of the  Powers  ofthe world,  have  decided  to  conclude  anew treaty of arbitration enlarging thescope  and obligations of  the  arbitrationconvention signed at Washington on the4th April, 1908,  which expires by lirriita-tion on the 4th June, 1928, and for thatpurpose  they  have  appointed as theirrespective plenipotentiaries :  The President of the United States ofAmerica:Arbitration Convention of 1908 between   the United Kingdom and the United   States of A merica.  His Majesty the King  of  the UnitedKingdom  of Great Britain and Irelandand of the British  Dominions beyond these as, Emperor of  India, and the Presi-dent of the United  States of America.desiring  in  pursuance of  the principles set forth  in articles 15-19 of the Conven-tion  for the Pacific Settlement  of Inter-national Disputes,  signed at The Hague,the 29th July, 1899, to enter into negotia-tions for the conclusion of an arbitrationconvention, have named as their Plenipotentiaire-tentiaries, to wit :  His Majesty the King  of  the UnitedKingdom  of Great Britain and Irelandand of the British  Dominions beyond these as,  Emperor  of  India :  the right honourable James Bryce, O.M., and  The President of the United States ofAmerica : Elihu Root, Secretary of Stateof the United States;  Who, after having  communicated  toone another their full  powers,  found  in good and due form, have agreed upon thefollowing articles:   His Majesty the King of Great Britain,Ireland  and  the  British  dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India :who, having communicated to one anothertheir full powers found in good and dueform, have  agreed upon  the  followingarticles :
                                       3                                 133     Preamble. There is nothing in the preamble to which serious  objection  need be taken.   It may perhaps appear a  rather sweeping declaration that Great Britain and the United States should state  that they are &quot; desirious of reaffirming  their adherence  to  the policy  of submitting&apos;  to impartial  decision   all  justiciable controversies.&quot; but there can be no great objection to such a statement  appearing in a preamble.                      French Amendment to the Preamble.     &quot;Apart from purely verbal amendments, there  is only one point to which attention need be drawn; at the end of the  preamble the American draft speaks of &quot;enlarging the scope and obligations of the  Arbitration  Convention signed at Washington  on the  Itli April, 1908.&quot;  The  French substitute a  phrase, a  literal  translation  of which  is:  &quot;enlarging the scope (of the 1908 Arbitration Treaty) and developing, in conformity with modern international law, its obligatory principles.&quot;  The  French rendering  is  probably intended  to direct  attention  to the tendencies towards compulsory arbitration inherent  in  modern international law.               ARTICLE 1.  Any disputes arising between the high contracting parties,  of whatever  nature they may be,  shall, when ordinary diplo- matic  proceedings have  failed and  the high contracting  parties  do  not have recourse to adjudication by a competent tribunal, be submitted for  investigation and  report, as prescribed in the treaty signed  at Washington, the loth Septcm- ber, 1914, to the Permanent International                          ,Commission constituted pursuant thereto.     Article 1. There was no corresponding article in the Boot-Bryee Treaty.  The article does not appear to  have  any effect other than  that of linking up the new draft treaty  with the treaty  concluded  in 1914  for  the  establishment of a Peace Commission,  commonly known as the Bryan Peace  Treaty (see Appendix V).  This treaty  provides that  all disputes between the contracting parties of any  nature whatsoever (other than those,  the settlement  of  which is already provided  for  in existing agreements) shall, when  diplomatic methods of adjustment have failed,  be referred for  investigation  and report to a   permanent  international  commission. Hostilities are not to be  commenced  during such investigation.  The commission is composed of five members, one member to be chosen from each country by the Govern- ment of that  country;  one member  to be chosen by each  Government  from  some third country;  the fifth member to be chosen by common agreement between the two Governments.   Since its signature  in 1914 no dispute has been referred to this Peace Commission.    Under the new- American draft a  reference to the Bryan Treaty  is definitely to be regarded as the  first step to  be  taken by the contracting parties  whenever they have failed to  reach agreement through the diplomatic channel or whenever there has been no prior agreement to refer  the dispute  to some other tribunal.               ARTICLE 2.                             ARTICLE 1.  All differences relating to international    Differences which may arise of a legal matters in which the high  contracting  nature or relating to the interpretation  of parties are concerned by virtue of  a claim  treaties existing between the two contract-of right made by one against the other,   ing parties and  which it  may  not  have under treaty  or otherwise, which it  has  been possible to settle by diplomacy, shallnot been possible to adjust by diplomacy,  be  referred to the  Permanent Court  of which have not been adjusted  as a result  Arbitration established at  The Hague by of reference to the above-mentioned Per-  the convention of  the 29th July, 1899, manent International  Commission,  ami  provided, nevertheless,  that they do not which are justiciable  in their nature by  affect  the  vital interests,  the  indepen- reason of being susceptible of decision by  deuce, or the honour of the two contract- the application of the principles of law or  ing  States,  and  do  not  concern  the equity,  shall be submitted to the Perm a-  interests of third parties.

Article 2, paragraph 1, of the new draft takes the place of article 1 and the first sentence of article 2 of the 1908 treaty.    The drafting of this paragraph  is defective by reason of the presence of a double attempt to define the word &quot;justiciable.&quot;&apos;   If the dispute relates to a matter in which one party is concerned by virtue of a claim of right against the other, thedispute must  necessarily be  justiciable.  Furthermore,  if  a  justiciable case  is inquestion, it is confusing to define it as &quot;susceptible of decision by the applicationof a rule of ... . equity.&quot;   &quot;Equity&quot;&apos; is an elusive  term,  and, in  international relations it means something more than strict law.  The word &quot;equity&quot; shouldpreferably be omitted.       Continuation of Article 2.                 Coiitmuation of Article 2.  The special agreement in each case shall     It is understood that such special agree-be made on the part of the United States   ments on the part of the United Statesof America by the President of the United   will be made  by  the  President of theStatesof America, by and with the advice   United States, by and with the advice andand consent of the Senate thereof, and on   consent  of  the  Senate  thereof; his part of the British Empire in accord-   Majesty*s Government reserving the rightance with the constitutional laws of the   before concluding a special agreement inBritish Empire,  His Majesty&apos;s Govern-   any matter affecting the interests of a self-ment  reserving the right before conclud-   governing  Dominion  of  the   Britishing a  special  agreement An  any matter   Empire to obtain the concurrence thereinaffecting the interests of a self-governing   of the Government of that Dominion.Dominion of the British Empire to obtain     Such agreements shall be binding onlythe concurrence  therein of  the Govern-   wdien confirmed by the two Governmentsment of that Dominion.                   by an exchange of notes.    Article 2. paragraph 2. This paragraph takes the  place of the remainder of  article 2  of the  1908 treaty.  As  in the case of the  earlier treaty weare faced with the difficulty that the special agreement, the conclusion of which is a necessary preliminary to the reference of any dispute to arbitration, remains subjectto ratification by the Senate.   This body,  therefore, has  the  power, by refusing to sanction the conclusion of  the special agreement,  to  prevent  arbitration upon  amatter which admittedly falls within the terms of the draft treaty. In this respect the  treaty  (like its  predecessors)  is  one-sided,  because  the Senate  exercisesconstitutionally on the treaty-making powers of the Executive a restrictive influence,which, differing in degree  from  that exercised by the Legislature under Britishparliamentary institutions, is in practice used remorselessly and with little regard for the wishes of the Administration of the day.  This is a difficulty inherent inany treaty with the United States.     At first sight, the following formula, in which the new wording is in italics,would seem preferable to the present American draft of article 2, paragraph 2 :          &quot; The special agreement in each case shall be made on the part of the United     States of  America by the  President of the  United States of America, by and     with  the advice and consent of  the  Senate thereof, and  on the part of His     Majesty&apos;s dominions by His Majesty the King in accordance with constitutional     practice.&quot;     The expression ** His Majesty&apos;s dominions,&quot;  used in this sense means the  whole of the British Empire, and not the self-governing Dominions.     The words &quot;in accordance with constitutional practice &quot; would,  I am advised, cover the case  where the Government of the day  (either  in Great Britain or the Dominions) considered the subject matter of any  special agreement &quot; to be of such
vital importance that they desired to submit the instrument, before ratification, tothe British Parliament or Parliaments concerned.  In such a case Parliament wouldhave the same opportunity as the American Senate to reject the agreement if itthought fit.  The proposed wording should enable us effectively to meet a possibleobjection raised by the  United  States Government  that other important treatieshave not been  submitted to Parliament with the answer that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment or Governments concerned must be the judges of what is or is not of sufficient importance to merit submission  to Parliament, and that the advice they tender tothe Crown is based upon  such a consideration.    The present position with regard to the renewal of the 1908 Arbitration treaty with the United States  is that, in order to conform with the decisions of the ImperialConference of 1926,  it will be necessary to redraft the treaty so that  all  the self-governing parts of the Empire can participate directly in and sign it.                       French  Amendments to Article 2.     The first sentence of article 2 of the new draft provides that &quot; all differences  ... in which the high contracting parties are concerned by virtue of a claim of right made by one against the  other under treaty or  otherwise, which it  has notbeen possible  to adjust by diplomacy,  which have not been  adjusted as  the resultof reference to the above-mentioned Permanent International  Commission, &amp;c.&quot;The  French counter-draft proposes  the omission of the  words &quot; which it  has notbeen possible to adjust by diplomacy.&quot;  The purpose of this French omission is not clear, since the French Government cannot mean  to exclude the preliminary  attemptto settle a dispute through the diplomatic channel.     At the end of  article 2,  the French Government propose a new  paragraph, asfollows :          &quot; In case  it is not possible to conclude the special agreement provided for     in the preceding paragraph, action will be taken in accordance *with articles 53     and 54 of The Hague Convention of the 18th October, 1907.&quot;     This  is probably  an ingenious attempt by the French Government to overcome the difficulty  raised by the  constitutional  right of the Senate to consent  to  (andtherefore  to reject) a special agreement defining the point to be arbitrated.   ThisHague Convention  embodies machinery for enabling the Arbitration  Tribunal tosettle the terms of the special agreement or &quot; compromis &quot; as it is called, if theparties fail to reach  an understanding.   Under these articles,  the &quot;compromis&quot;is to be settled by  a  commission of five members,  two nominated by  each of theparties, and the fifth, who should preside, chosen by agreement, or,  failing agree-ment. by a third Power.  Where  the two parties are unable to agree on a  third Powerwho  is to choose the umpire, each of them chooses a foreign Power, and  those twoforeign Powers between them appoint the umpire.  If even  this machinery fails to result in the appointment of an umpire, he is to be appointed by lot.   The result would  be  to take the  matter  out of the hands of the Senate if the Senate declinesto approve the special agreement arranged between the  executive departments ofthe two Governments.  Judging by a statement made to Lord Crewe, M.  Briand ishopeful that the Senate may be induced by this means to pass the treaty as a whole.and,  in so doing, abrogate its claim to previous examination of any matter in disputebefore consenting to the case going to arbitration.  It seems most unlikely, however.that  M. BriancPs proposal can have  any prospect of success,  since Mr.  Kellogg has informed  Sir Esme Howard  that it  would be &quot; impossible &quot; for the United StatesGovernment to avoid  submitting any such special agreement to the  Senate beforeentering upon arbitration.  Moreover, the Senate would undoubtedly reject any such proposal, even if it were to be made to it by the Administration.             ARTICLE 3.  The provisions of this  treaty shall  notbe invoked in  respect  of any  dispute thesubject matter of which      (a.) Is within  the domestic jurisdic-  tion  of  either of  the high  contracting  parties.
s    (b.)  Involves the  interests of  third  parties.    (c.)  Depends  upon  or involves  the  maintenance   of   the   traditional  attitude of  the  United States con-  cerning American questions, commonly  described as the Monroe doctrine.    This article contains the revised  formula for the reservations, to be substituted  .for the old phrase about vital interests, honour, &amp;c, in article 1 of the old treaty.    The first heading relates to questions within the domestic jurisdiction of either party.    At the forthcoming meeting  of the Security Commission at Geneva the general question of the reservations to be made in arbitration  treaties  will come up  fordiscussion.  If as a result of these discussions  it is agreed that some reservationas to matters exclusively  within the  jurisdiction  of one of the  parties should be formulated, its text should be studied  in detail by a competent committee of lawyers.&quot;Domestic jurisdiction &quot; is not  altogether satisfactory as a phrase to  express  the underlying idea.   By  international  law  the principle is admitted  that  everysovereign State is supreme over certain questions; that is to say  that, except in sofar as it may voluntarily limit its freedom of action by treaty, it may act as it thinksbest in  these matters.   Within this field no foreign State has a  right to complainof any action which may  affect one of its  nationals.   But  the extent of this fieldis vague and indefinite, and I should feel less uneasiness about using the phrase asa reservation in an arbitration treaty if agreement were a little more general as towhat it covered.     It may be mentioned  as an  example that the  United States  Government have always  held  that matters relating to immigration are exclusively of Americanconcern, and there can be no doubt that, under this reservation, they expect to remove from the field of arbitration any dispute with Japan in  regard to the immigrationquestion a matter which has in the  past  led to much ill-feeling between  the twocountries.    The second reservation excludes disputes which involve the  interests of third parties.  It is at this point that some form of words might be added so as to exclude from arbitration any question affecting our  belligerent rights at sea.  Quite  possiblyone of the objects of the United States Government is to bring this question withinthe scope of the treaty; they would  claim that the question is  justiciable &quot; because there is a body of international law which is supposed to  govern the exercise of such rights, and they might further maintain that it cannot be held to  be excluded underarticle 3, paragraph (b), because it is  clearly not an &quot; interest&quot; of a third party tobe blockaded.  In the present political situation it would be advisable to find somebetter means than an  explicit reservation  of such  rights, because the latter coursewould immediately raise a storm in the United States and be used by the Big Navy-party as a useful weapon  in their campaign for naval expansion.  Perhaps  thedifficulty could be overcome by some elaboration of paragraph (&amp;) which, while  not specifically referring  to the question  of belligerent rights,  would  nevertheless  be suffiently comprehensive to prevent its compulsory reference to an arbitral tribunal.Whether, however, it is done implicitly or explicitly, I think there, can  be no doubtthat any dispute which might prevent the exercise of naval pressure b)&apos; the british fleet in time of war must be. excluded from the operation of the new treaty.     The third reservation  is that of the Monroe doctrine.  I confess I do not under-stand how this reservation is intended to work in practice.  The Monroe doctrine isa policy of the United States relating to American countries other than the UnitedStates itself.   It constitutes a notification to all the world that certain interferenceson  the part of European States with the republics of the Western Hemisphere, willbe regarded by the United States as a casvs belli.   If, therefore,  a dispute between this country and the United States involves the application  of  the Monroe doctrine,it will  be because, some action  taken  by this country  towards  a Latin-Americanrepublic will  be  regarded  by the United  States as such an interference with thatrepublic as to necessitate objection, and, in the last resort, belligerent action by theUnited States.  The  United States would not base such intervention on a  claim of&quot;right&quot; ; it is merely a policy;  consequently the intervention would not constitute a justiciable dispute within the meaning of the treaty, i.e., would not  constitute  a dispute  in which the parties to the treaty would be in conflict as  to their respective
rights.  The United States have no  &quot;right&quot; in the technical sense of that term to intervene; such a right must be. based on law or treaty.    If a claim by the United States to intervene is to be elevated into a right, theMonroe doctrine must itself be elevated into something of the nature of a law or atreaty.  For that purpose it must be defined.  Hitherto it has been of the essence ofthe Monroe  doctrine, that, being  an American policy, it was for the United States to interpret the doctrine and apply  it as they pleased.  In fact, the Monroe doctrine has grown with  the growing strength of the United States and is to-day in the Americanpopular mind a different tiling from the doctrine originally proclaimed a century ago.     It seems, on the whole,  probable that the United States Government, were they asked  to define what is  the precise  intention of paragraph  (c) of article 3, would reply,  if they were frank, that what they desire to avoid is to arbitrate any disputewhich  might ultimately  call into question  the validity of the.  Monroe  doctrine, asexpounded by President  Monroe, and as further interpreted  since that time by various American statesmen.  I attach in  Appendix VI an extract from PresidentMonroe&apos;s  Message of December 1823, together  with quotations from  authoritativeAmerican pronouncements in regard to the doctrine-    There are objections to inviting the United States Government to define more precisely the intention of this reservation, chief amongst which is the possibility thatit might lead to a dispute between  the two countries if some new and wider claimwere now to be put forward in response to our invitation. If enquiry is held to benecessary on this point, it could  best be made by inviting confirmation  by the UnitedStates Government,  for the sake of  clarity and to avoid  future misunderstanding,that the  doctrine  is  correctly  defined  by the  various declarations quoted  inAppendix V.                        French Amendment to Article 3.    The French suggest  the addition of a fourth reservation at the end of article 3,which,  provides that the treaty shall not be invoked in  respect of  any dispute thesubject-matter of which &quot;depends upon or involves the observance by France of herengagements under the Covenant of the League  of Nations.&quot;    At first  sight France&apos;s engagements under the Covenant of the League of nations would  appear to  be covered by the reservation in paragraph  (b), which excludesquestions  involving the interests of third  parties.  But the  French have evidentlywished to make assurance doubly sure on this point, and it will probably be wise thata similar reservation should be added to the Anglo-American  draft.              ARTICLE 4.  The present treaty shall be ratified bythe President of  the United States ofAmerica by and with the advice and con-sent of the Senate thereof and by HisMajesty the King  of Great Britain, Ire-land and the British Dominions beyondthe Seas, Emperor of India, in accord-ance with the constitutional  laws of theBritish Empire.  The ratifications shallbe exchanged at Washington as soon aspossible, and the treaty shall take effect onthe date of the exchange of the  ratifica-tions.  It shall thereafter remain in forcecontinuously unless and  until terminatedby  one yearfs written  notice given  by either high contracting party to the other.  In faith whereof the  respective pleni-potentiaries have  signed this treaty in duplicate and hereunto affix their seals.  Done at Washington the       day of       ,  in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred  and twenty-       [17095]              ARTICLE 3.   The present convention shall be ratified by His Britannic Majesty,  and by thePresident  of  the  United   States  ofAmerica by and with the advice and con-sent of the Senate thereof. The ratifica-tions shall be exchanged at Washingtonas soon as possible, and  the convention shall  take effect  on  the date  of theexchange of its ratifications.              ARTICLE 4.   The present convention is concluded fora period of five years, dating from the dayof the exchange of its ratifications.   Done in duplicate at the City of Wash-ington, this fourth day of April, in theyear 1908.             (Signed)  JAMES  BRYCE.             (Signed)  ELIUUHOOT.c
     A rticle 4 of the new draft corresponds to articles 3 and 4 of the Root^-BryceTreaty.  The new draft provides that the treaty shall remain in  force continuouslyunless and  until  terminated  by one year&apos;s written notice, given by either highcontracting party to the other.  The old treaty was concluded for a period of fiveyears only, but has hitherto been renewed without modification at the end of eachfive-yearly period.     From the British point of view the worst feature of the Draft arbitration treaty is that  we might find ourselves obliged to submit  to arbitration, under its&apos;present terms, a question involving the future exercise of our belligerent rights  at sea; subject to an amendment being introduced which would exclude this possibility,and  subject to the other amendments discussed above, which are mainly designed to revent possible divergencies of interpretation, the draft treaty does not appear to  3 open to serious objection.   It is, however, impossible to say with certainty that,even if its terms  are amended  so as to exclude  disputes  affecting the  exercise  of belligerent rights, some question of vital importance to this country  may not arise which we should be reluctantly compelled to arbitrate.  If we are to  have completecertainty on this point, it would be necessary once again to make some  reservationdesigned to cover questions involving our  vital interests.  An explicit  reservation of vital interests would, however, defeat one of the main purposes of  the new draft(which has even been emphasised by the French), that is, the elimination of the clauserelating  to the vital interests, the independence  or the honour of the contractingparties.  We should, moreover,  by  reverting simply  to the old text, lay ourselvesopen to the criticism that we had made no advance during the last twenty years.     It is in any case premature to express  a definite  opinion on the draft treatyuntil we are in possession of the report of the Geneva Security Commission, whichis conducting an enquiry into the reservations appropriate to treaties of arbitration.This report may be expected in the course of March.  Furthermore, it would be well to await the report  of the Cabinet Committee now sitting on the question of ourbelligerent rights at sea before committing ourselves to a definite opinion as to themanner in which those rights should be reserved in the new draft treaty.     The Dominion Governments have been  kept fully informed by telegram of theprogress of the Franco-American negotiations, and copies of the two  draft treatieswere promptly communicated  to the Dominions Office.  Pending the  receipt of thereports to which I have referred, it would be well that the Dominion governments should be informed as soon as possible  of the preliminary opinion reached by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in  Great Britain  in regard to the two draft treaties and invited to give us the benefit of their observations on these instruments.

Correspondence between the French and United States Governments relative to the                negotiation of a Pact of Perpetual Friendship.                                                Department of State, Washington,Excellency,                                          December 2S,  1927.     I  HAVE the  honour to refer  lo  the form of treaty entitled  &quot; Draft of Pact ofPerpetual Friendship between France and the  United States &quot; which  his  Excellency,the Minister for Foreign Alfairs, was good  enough to transmit to me informally lastdune through the instrumentality of the American Ambassador at  Paris.     Tins draft treaty proposes that the  two  Powers should  solemnly declare in thename of  their respective peoples that, they condemn  recourse to war, renounce it as an instrument of their national policy towards each  other, and agree that a settlement of disputes  arising between  them, of whatsoever nature or  origin  they may lie, shall never be sought by either party except through pacific: means.   I have given the most careful consideration to this proposal and take this occasion warmly to reciprocate onbehalf of the American people  the  lofty sentiments of friendship which  inspired theFrench people through his  Excellency, M.  Briand, to suggest the proposed treaty.     The Government  of the United  States  welcomes every  opportunity  for joiningwith the  other Governments of  the  world in condemning war and pledging anew itsfaith in arbitration.  It is firmly of  the opinion that  every  international endorsement of arbitration and  every  treaty repudiating the idea of  a  resort to arms for thesettlement of justiciable disputes materially advances the  cause of world  peace.  my views on this subject find a concrete expression in the form of the arbitration treaty which  I  have proposed in  my  note  to  you  of  the 26th December, 1927,  to take theplace of the Arbitration Convention of 190S.   The proposed treaty extends the scopeof that convention  and records the unmistakable determination of  the two governments to prevent any breach in the friendly relations which  have  subsisted between them for so long a period.     In view  of the  traditional friendship  between France and  the United States afriendship which happily is not dependent upon the existence of any formal engagementand in view of  the common  desire  of the  two nations never to resort to  arms in thesettlement of such  controversies as may possibly arise between them, which is recorded in the draft  arbitration treaty  just  referred  to it has occurred to me that the twoGovernments, instead  of  contenting themselves  with a  bilateral declaration of thenature suggested by M. Briand, might  make  a more signal  contribution to world peace by joining in an effort  to obtain the adherence of  all  the principal Powers of the world to a declaration renouncing war as an instrument of national policy.  Such a  declaration,if executed by the  principal world Powers, could  not  but be an impressive example toall the other  nations of the  world and might conceivably lead such nations to subscribein their  turn to  the same instrument, thus perfecting among all the Powers of theworld an arrangement  heretofore suggested only as  between  France  and the UnitedStates.     The Government of the United  States  is prepared therefore to concert with theGovernment  of France with a view to the conclusion  of a  treaty  among  the principalPowers of the world, open to signature by all nations, condemning war  and renouncingit as an instrument of national policy in favour of  the pacific settlement of international disputes,   if the Government of France is willing to join with the Government of theUnited  States in this endeavour, and to enter with  the  United States and the otherprincipal Powers of the world into an appropriate multilateral  treaty, I shall be happy to engage at once hi conversations looking to the preparation of a draft treatyfollowing the lines suggested by M. Briand for submission  by France  and the  UnitedStates jointly to the other nations of the world.                                                   Accept, &amp;c.                                                       FRANK B. KELLOGG.     Reponse d la Lettre da Secretaire d&apos;that  das Ftats-Unis du 28 Decembre 1927.     Par sa  lettre  du 28 decembre dernier, votre  Excellence  a bien voulu  me faireconnaitre le  sentiment du Gouvernemeut des Etats-Unis sur le  projet d&apos;acte proposepar le Gouvernement de la Republique au mois de juin 1U27 en vue de condamner la
guerre ct de renoncer a  la  guerre  comme  instrument  de la politique  nationalereciproque de la France et des Etats-Unis.    Selon votre Excellence, les deux Gouvernemcnts, au lieu  de  se  borner a uu actebilateral, eontribueraient davantage h la paix du monde  en  joignaut leur8 efforts pourobtenir l&apos;adhesion de toutes les principales Puissances du monde a une declaration derenonciation  a la guerre conime instrument de  leur politique nationale.  Une  telledeclaration, si elle etait souscrite par les principales Puissances, ne saurait qu&apos;etre unexemple  solcnnel pour  toutos les  nations du  monde  et pourrait sans dome amenercelles-ci  a souscrire. a leur tour a ce  memo  acte, achevant ainsi  entre toutes  lesPuissances du monde un arrangement jusqu&apos;ici suggere seulemcnt entre la France etles Etats-Unis.     En consequence, le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis  serait dispose a  se concerteravec le  Gouvernemcnt  de  la  Republique  en vue  de conclure cntre les principalesPuissances du  monde un  traite qui,  ouvert a  la signature (le toutes les  nations,condamaerait la guerre, contiendrait la  declaration d&apos;y renoncer comme instrumentde la politique nationale et y  substituerait le reglement j)acifique des  contestationsentre les nations.     Votre Excellence ajoulait quo si  le Gouvernemeut de la Eepublique  acceptait dese joindre a  cet  egaril au Gouvernement des Etats-Unis  et de participer avec.  lesEtats-Unis et les  autres  principales  Puissances  du monde  a  un acte  multilateralapproprie, votre  Excellence serait heureuse cFengager inunediatement les conversationsen vue de la  preparation d&apos;un projet  inspire des suggestions de M. Briand et destinea etre propose conjointement  par la  France et les  Etats-Uuis aux autres nations dumontle.    Le  Gouvernement de  la Republique a bautement apprecie 1&apos;accueil favorable quele Goiiverncnient des Etats-Unis a bien voulu faire a la proposition de  M. Briand.   IIestime que la procedure suggeree par  votre Excellence et suivie dans des termescorrespondant a l&apos;opinion  publique  et. au sentiment populaire  des diverscs nationsapparait  bien comme de nature a satisfaire aux vues du  Gouvernement francais.   II yaurait a vantage  a en  consacrer des a present le caractere par la signature de  laFrance et des Etats-Unis.    Je suis autorise a vous faire conuaitre quo le Gouvernement de la Republique estdispose a se joiudre au  Gouvernement des l3tats-Unis pour proposer a 1&apos;a.ccrement de toutes les nations uu acte ainsi des a present signe par la  France et les Etats-UniB,et aux termes duquel les  hautes parties contractantes s&apos;interdiraient  toute guerred&apos;agi-ession et declareraient que, pour le  regleinent  des conflits de quelque naturequ&apos;ils soient  qui viendraient a s&apos;elever  entre elles, elles emploieront tous les moyenspacifiques.   Les  hautes parties contractantes  s&apos;engageraient a porter cet acte  a  lacoimaissauce  de tons les Etats et a  les ihviter a y acceder.    Le   tlouvernement de la  Republique  est  convaincu  que  ces  maximes  ainsiproelamees ne sauraient etre accueillies qu&apos;avec gratitude par le moude entier, et  il uudouta pas que les efforts des deux Uouvernements pour en assurer Patloption universellene soient couronnes d&apos;uu plein succes.     (Washington, 5 Janvier   1928.)Excellency,                                      Washington, January 11, 1928.    IN the reply which your Government  was good  enough to make  to my note of the 28th  December,  1927, his Excellency  the Minister  for Foreign  Affairs,summarised briefly the proposal presented by the Government of the United Statesanil stated that ft appeared to be of such a nature as to satisfy the views of theFrench  Government.   In the circumstances he added  that the  Government of theRepublic was disposed to join with the Government of the United States in proposingfor acceptance by all nations a treaty to be signed at the present time by Franceand the United States under the terms of which the high contracting parties shouldrenounce all wars of  aggression  and  should  declare &quot;that they would  employ  allpeaceful means for the settlement of any differences that might  arise between them.The  Government of the United States is deeply gratified that  the Government ofFrance has seen its way clear to accept, in principle, its proposal that, instead of the bilateral pact originally suggested  by M.  Briand.  there be negotiated  among theprincipal Powers of the world an equivalent multilateral treaty open to signatureby all nations.  There can be no doubt that such a multilateral treaty would be a far more effective instrument for the promotion of pacific relations than a mere agreement
between  France and the United States alone, and, if the present efforts of the twoGovernments achieve ultimate success, they will have made a memorable contributionto the cause of world peace.     While the Government of France and  the Government  of the United states are now closely in accord so far as the multilateral treaty is concerned, the language of M. Briand&apos;s note of the 5th January, 1928, is in two respects open to an interpre-tation not  in  harmony with  the idea which the Government of the United states had  in mind when  it submitted to you the proposition outlined in my note of the28th  December, 1927.   In the  first place,  it  appears to  be  the  thought of  your government that the  proposed multilateral treaty be signed in  the first instance by france and the United States  alone, and then submitted to  the other Powers fortheir acceptance. In  the opinion of  the Government of the United  States this pro-cedure is open to the objection that a treaty, even though acceptable to France and the United States, might for some reason be unacceptable to one of the other great powers.  In such event the treaty could not come into force, and the present efforts of France and the United States would be rendered abortive.   This unhappy result would not necessarily follow  a disagreement as to terminology arising prior to thedefinitive approval  by any Government of a proposed  form  of treaty,  since  it isby no means unreasonable to  suppose that the  views of the Governments concerned could be accommodated through informal  preliminary discussions and a text devised which would be acceptable to them all. Both France and the  United States are toodeeply interested in the  success of their  endeavours for the advancement of  peaceto be willing  to jeopardize the  ultimate  accomplishment  of their  purpose  byincurring unnecessary risK of disagreement with the other Powers concerned, andI have no doubt that your Government will be entirely agreeable to joining  withthe Government of the United  States and the Governments of the other powers concerned for the purpose of reaching a preliminary  arrangement as to the languageto be used in the proposed treaty, thus obviating all danger of confronting the other powers  with a definitive treaty unacceptable  to them.   As  indicated  below, theGovernment of the United States would be pleased if the Government  of france would agree that the draft treaty submitted by M. Briand  last June should be madethe basis of such preliminary  discussions.    In the second place and  this point is closely  related to  what goes before M.  BriancPs reply of the 5th January, 1928,  in expressing the willingness of theGovernment of France to join  with the Government of the. United States in proposing a multilateral  treaty for  the renunciation of war. apparently contemplates that thescope of  such  treaty should be  limited to wars of  aggression.  The. form of treaty which your Government submitted to me last June, which was  the subject of my note of the 28th December, 1927, contained no such qualifications.   On the contrary, it provided unequivocally for the  renunciation by the  high contracting Powers of all war as an instrument of national policy in the following terms:                                   &quot; ARTICLE 1.        &quot; The high contracting Powers solemnly declare, in the name of the French    people and the people of the  United States of America, that they condemn    recourse to war and renounce it respectively as an instrument of their national    policy towards each other.                                  &quot; ARTICLE 2.        &quot; The  settlement or the solution of all disputes or conflicts, of whatever    nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise between France, and    the United States  of America, shall never be sought by  either side except by    pacific means.&quot;    I am  not informed of the reasons which have led your Government to suggestthis modification  of  its original proposal, but I earnestly hope that it  is of no particular significance and that it is not to be taken as an indication that the Govern-ment  of France will find itself unable to join  with  the Government of the UnitedStates in  proposing, as suggested  above, that the  original formula submitted byM. Briand, which envisaged the unqualified renunciation of all war as an instrument of national policy, be made the subject of preliminary discussions  with  the otherGreat Powers for the purpose of reaching a tentative agreement as to the languageto be used in the proposed treaty.
Extract from the &quot; Times &quot; oj January 23. 1928.                          THE PEACE PACT PROPOSAL.                  Text of M. Briand&apos;s Xote to the United States.                        (From our own correspondent.)                                                     Paris, January 22. 1928.     Your  Excellency was  good enough  to transmit  to  me in your letter of  the 11th  instant the observations  which were suggested to you by  my letter of  the 5th January, in reply to your communication of the 28th December, 1927.   My Government  has asked me to express to you its satisfaction at  seeing the progress which has been made, thanks to your Excellency, towards  an understanding between the two Governments concerning the method to be followed in order to establish a project on the general principles of which they seem to be agreed.    The original  French project of June 1927, which envisaged an agreement confined  to France and the United  States, seemed, in the opinion of the French Government,  desirable and attainable in  view of  the historic relations between  the two republics.  The United States Government accepted the declaration proposed by the French Government only as  a preamble to the Franco-American Treaty of Arbitration which is about to be renewed, and considered, for reasons to which it is entitled,  and which the French Government is anxious to take into consideration, that it would be useful to extend the scope of this manifestation against war, to make it the subject of a separate note, and to invite the other Powers to take part in it.    The Government of the Republic was not unwilling to see  its  original plan extended in this way, but it did not  conceal from itself, and thought it its duty to point out, that the new negotiations which were  proposed would  be more complex and liable to  encounter various difficulties.  The question whether a treaty intended to be multilateral would gain more by being signed in  the first place bv  France and the United States or by being  prepared  beforehand  among some of  the principal Powers and subsequently offered  for signature to all the Powers, is essentially a question of procedure.  The Government  of the Republic  formulated its suggestion only in the desire to obtain more quickly and more  surely the result which it seeks in common with the United States.  It  is, however, ready to support the method that seems to it the most practical.                         League Members and Peace.    But  there  is a  situation  in  being to which my Government has asked  me particularly to draw attention.  It cannot have escaped the United States Govern-ment that the great majority of the  Powers of the world, and among  them most of the principal Powers, are making the organisation and consolidation of  peace  an object of common efforts which they pursue  within the framework of the League of Nations.  They are already bound to one another  by a pact which imposes mutualobligations upon them ana  by  agreements,  such as those concluded at Locarno  in 1925,  or  by international conventions which deal with  guarantees of  neutrality.All these engagements impose duties which they cannot deny.    If your Government is agreeable to the plan outlined above and is willing thatthe further discussions of the terms of the proposed multilateral treaty be based uponthe original proposal submitted by M. Briand last June, I have the honour to suggestthat the Government of France join with the Government of the United States in a communication to  the  British,  German,  Italian  and  Japanese  Governments,transmitting the text of M. Briahd&apos;s original proposal and copies of the subsequentcorrespondence between the Governments of France and the United States for their consideration and comment, it being understood, of course, that these preliminary discussions would in no way commit any of the participating Governments  pendingthe&apos; conclusion of a definitive treaty.                                              Accept. &amp;c.                                                  FRANK B. KELLOGG.
     Tn particular, your Excellency is not unaware that all  the States which were members of the League of Nations and  were represented  at Geneva in Septemberlast adopted, in a  resolution directed towards the condemnation of wars, certainprinciples which were determined by regard for the rights and duties of each.  Inthis resolution the Powers were led to specify that the action to be condemned as aninternational crime is a war of aggression, and that  all peaceful means should heemployed for the settlement of differences of any  nature which may arise between states.  This is a position of affairs  which the United States, though they remainoutside it. cannot refuse to take into consideration in  the same way as all  the states which  may be called to take part in the negotiations.  The fact of such consideration would  not  bind the  United States in any way to the Covenant of the League ofNations.     The French  proposal of last  June for the conclusion of a bilateral pact was drawn up with due regard to the general relations  of France and the United States:The Government of  the Republic  is still ready to negotiate with  the Governmentof the United States in the same  conditions and  on  the same  basts.  It  has neverchanged its attitude in this respect, but in the face of  the United States proposal to conclude a multilateral  pact the French Government had to take into consideration the relations of the various Powers which would lie invited  to take part  in such a pact.  It did this with the object of assuring the success of the  treaty which theUnited States proposes.  Tts suggestions of the 5th January as to the terms of the multilateral treaty arc inspired only  by  the formula which has  already obtained the unanimous support of  all the Powers members of the League of Nations andwhich  they can  accordingly accept as regards the United States, since they havealready accepted them among themselves.     This is the explanation of our proposal of the 5th January.     The Government of the Republic has  always, and in all circumstances, declareditself, very clearly and without reserve, ready to associate itself with any declarationhaving for its object the denunciation of war as a crime and the institution of inter-national sanctions calculated to prevent and repress it.   Its feeling  in this connexionhas not changed.  Its position  remains the same.  Your Excellency can,  therefore.be assured of the sincere desire of  the French Government to respond to the idea ofthe United States Government and to support its efforts to  any extent compatible with the existing situation created by its international obligations.  The formula ofthe 5th  January, which seems  clearly the best calculated  to  assure the  promptrealisation  of the American  project, was inspired  by this  consideration.  TheGovernment of  the Republic  can  only hope, therefore, to see the United  StatesGovernment agree to it.     With due regard to these observations, the Government of the Republic would very willingly receive any suggestion which the United States Government might put  forward and which would make it possible to  reconcile the absolute condemn a-tion of war with the engagements and obligations contracted  by the various nations and  their legitimate  care of their  individual security.APPENDIX  III.                        Mr.  Kellogg to Sir E. Howard.Excellency,                                                December 29, 1927.    I HAVE the honour to refer to our conversation of this morning and to transmitherewith,  for the consideration of your Government and as a basis for negotiation,a draft of a proposed Treaty of Arbitration.  The provisions of this draft operate to extend  the  policy of  arbitration enunciated in  the convention  signed atWashington, the 4th April, 1908 (which expires by limitation on the 4th June, 1928),and explicitly record the desire  of  the  two Governments to condemn Avar as an instrument of national policy in their mutual relations.  The language of the draft is mutatis mutandis identical with that of the draft treaty which I yesterday trans-mitted to  the French Ambassador for the consideration  of his Government,  exceptfor the reservation at the end of article 11 covering cptestions involving the interestsof a  self-governing Dominion  of  the British Empire.  This clause was taken fromarticle 1 of the Knox Treaty, concluded in 1911, but never coming into force.    I feel that by adopting a treaty such as that suggested herein, we shall not  onlypromote the friendly relations between the peoples of our two countries, but  also-
advance  materially the cause of arbitration  and the  pacific settlement of inter-national  disputes.  If your  Government  concurs in  my views and is  prepared tonegotiate a treaty along the  lines of that transmitted herewith,  I shall be glad toenter at once upon such discussions as maybe necessary.                                               Accept, &amp;c.                                                    FRANK  B.  KELLOGG.                                   Enclosure.                          Draft Treaty of Arbitration.     THE President of the United States of America and His  Majesty the king of Great Britain.  Ireland and the British Dominions  beyond  the Seas, Emperor ofIndia, determined to prevent  so far as in their power lies any interruption in the peaceful relations that have happily existed between the two nations for more than a century, desirous  of reaffirming their adherence to  the  policy of  submitting toimpartial decision all justiciable controversies that may arise between them, andeager by their  example not only to demonstrate  their condemnation of war as  an instrument of national policy  in their mutual relations, but also  to hasten the  timewhen the perfection of  international arrangements for the  pacific settlement  ofinternational disputes shall have eliminated forever the possibility of war among anyof the Powers of the world, have decided to  conclude  a new Treaty of Arbitrationenlarging the  scope and  obligations of  the  Arbitration  Convention, signed  atWashington on the 4th April. 1908. which expires by limitation  on  the 4th June. 1928,and  for that  purpose they have appointed as their respective plenipotentiaries:     The President of the United States of America.

ARTICLE  2.    All differences relating to international matters in which the high contractingparties are concerned by virtue of a  claim of right  made hy one against the otherunder  treaty or otherwise, which it  has not  been possible to  adjust  by diplomacy,which  have not been adjusted  as a  result  of  reference to  the above-mentionedPermanent International Commission, and which  are justiciable  in their nature  byreason of being susceptible of  decision by the  application of the principles of  law orequity,  shall  be submitted to  the Permanent Court of Arbitration  established  atThe Hague by the convention  of the 18th October, 1907, or to some other competenttribunal, as shall be  decided in each case by special agreement, which special  agree-ment shall provide for the organisation  of  such tribunal if necessary,  define its powers, state the question or questions at issue, and settle the terms of reference.    The special agreement in each case shall be  made on the part of the UnitedStates of America by the President of the United States of America by and withthe advice and consent of the Senate thereof,  and  on  the part of the British empire in accordance with  the constitutional laws of the British Empire, His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment reserving the right before concluding a special agreement in any  matteraffecting tho interests of  a self-governing Dominion of  the British Empire to  obtainthe concurrence therein of the Government of that Dominion.

ARTICLE 4.    The present treaty shall  he ratified  by the President of the United States ofAmerica by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof and by His majesty the King of Great Britain,  Ireland  and the  British Dominions beyond the Seas,Emperor of India, in accordance with the constitutional laws of the  British Empire.The ratifications shall be exchanged at  Washington as soon  as possible, and thetreaty shall  take effect on the date of the exchange of the ratifications.

 Treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States of America with regard       to  the Establishment of  a Peace  Commission. (Signed at  Washington,       September 15, 1914.)          [Ratifications exchanged at Washington,  November 10, 1914.]     HIS  Majesty the  King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and the President of the United States of America, being desirous to  strengthen the bonds of amity that bind  them together and also to advance the cause of general peace, have resolved to enter into a treaty  for that purpose, and  to that end have appointed  as their plenipotentiaries:      His Britannic Majesty : The Right Honourable Sir  Cecil Arthur Spring-Rice, G.C.V.O., K.C.M.G., ivc, His Ambassador  Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary at Washington; and     The President of the  United States : The Honourable William Jennings Bryan, Secretary of State of the United States;     Who. after having communicated  to each other their respective full  powers, found  to  be  in  proper  form, have  agreed  upon  and  concluded  the  followingarticles :                                   ARTICLE 1.     The high contracting parties agree that all disputes  between them, of every nature whatsoever, other than disputes the settlement of which is provided for and, in fact, achieved  under existing agreements between the high contracting  parties,shall, when diplomatic  methods of adjustment have failed, be referred for investiga- tion and report to a Permanent International Commission, to be constituted in themanner prescribed in the next succeeding&apos; article; and they agree not to declare war or begin hostilities during such investigation and before the report is submitted.                                  ARTICLE 2.     The International  Commission shall be composed of  five members, to be appointed as follows :      One member shall  be chosen from each country by the Government thereof; one member shall be chosen by each  Government from some third country; the fifthmember shall be chosen  by  common agreement between the  two Governments,  it being understood that he shall not be a citizen of either country.     The expenses of the commission shall be paid by the two Governments in equal proportions.     The International  Commission shall be  appointed  within six months after theexchange of the ratifications of this treaty,  and vacancies shall  be  filled according to the manner of the original appointment.                                  ARTICLE 3.     In case the high contracting  parties  shall have failed to adjust a dispute by diplomatic methods, they shall at once  refer it to the International Commission for investigation  and  report.   The  International   Commission  may,  however, spontaneously, by unanimous agreement, offer its services  to that effect, and in such case it shall notify   both  Governments  and  request their  co-operation   in the investigation.     In the  event  of its appearing&apos; to  His Majesty&apos;s Government that the British interests affected by the dispute to be investigated are not mainly those of the United Kingdom, but are mainly those of some one or more of the self-governing Dominions, namely, the Dominion  of  Canada, the  Commonwealth  of Australia,  the Dominion of  New Zealand,  the  Union of South  Africa, and  Newfoundland,  His Majesty&apos;s Government shall  be at liberty to substitute as the member chosen by them  to serve on the International Commission for such investigation and report &quot;another person selected from a list of persons to be named, one  for each  of  the self-governing Dominions,  but only one shall act namely, that one who represents  the Dominion immed i a tely i n to rested.
    The high contracting parties agree  to  furnish the Permanent  international commission with all the means and facilities required for its  investigation  andreport.    The report of the International Commission shall be completed within one year after  the date on which  it shall declare its investigation to have begun, unless thehigh contracting  parties shall limit or extend the time  by  mutual agreement.  Thereport shall be prepared in triplicate; one copy shall be presented to each Govern-ment  and the  third retained by the commission for  its  files.    The high contracting parties reserve the right to act independently on thesubject-matter of the dispute after  the  report of the commission  shall have beensubmitted.                                  ARTICLE 4.    This treaty shall  not affect in  any  way the provisions of  the  treaty of the1 Ith January. 1909. relating to questions arising between the United States and theDominion of Canada.                                  ARTICLE 5.    The present treaty  shall lie  ratified  by His Britannic Majesty and by thePresident of the United  States of America, by and  with the advice and consent ofthe Senate thereof,  and the ratifications shall be  exchanged at  Washington as soonas possible.  It shall take effect immediately after the exchange of ratifications, andshall  continue in  force for a period of five years, and it shall thereafter remain inforce  until  twelve months  after one of  the  high contracting parties have given notice to the other of an intention to terminate it.

CECIL SPRIXG-RICE.                                (L.S.)       WILLIAM JEXXINGS BRYAN.APPENDIX VI.       Extract from Message of President Monroe, dated December 2, 1823.    IT was stated at the commencement of  the last Session that a great effort wasthen making in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition of the people of thosecountries, and that it appeared to be conducted with extraordinary moderation.  it need scarcely be remarked that the result has been, so far, very different from whatwas then anticipated.   Of events in that quarter  of the globe with which we have so much intercourse and from which  we derive our  origin  we have always been anxious  and  interested  spectators.    The citizens of  the  United States cherishsentiments the most friendly in favour of the liberty and happiness of their fellow-men on that side of the Atlantic.  In the wars of the European Powers, in matters relating to themselves, we have never taken  any part, nor does it comport with our policy  so to do.   It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced thatwe resent injuries or make preparation for our defence.  With the movements inthis hemisphere we are, of necessity,  more  immediately connected, and by causes which  must be obvious to all  enlightened and impartial observers.  The political system of the Allied Powers  is essentially  different  in this respect from that ofAmerica.   This difference proceeds from that which exists  in  their  respective governments.  And to the defence of our own, which has been achieved by the lossof so much blood and treasure, and matured by the  wisdom of their most enlightenedcitizens, and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity, this whole nation is devoted.  Wc owe it, therefore, to candour  and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those Powers, to declare that we should consider anyattempt on their part to extend their  system to any portion of this hemisphere asdangerous to our peace and safety.   With the existing colonies or dependencies of
any European  Power  we have not interfered, and shall not interfere.  But withthe  Governments  who have  declared  their independence  and maintained  it.  and whose independence we have  on  great  consideration  and  on  just  principlesacknowledged,  we could not  view any interposition for  the  purpose of oppressingthem or  controlling  in any other manner their destiny by any European Power, inany other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition towards theUnited States.   In the war between those new Governments and Spain, we declaredour neutrality  at  the time of their  recognition, and to this  we have adhered,  andshall continue to adhere, provided no change shall occur, which,  in the judgment ofthe competent authorities of this Government, shall make a  corresponding changeon the part of the  United States indispensable to their security.     The late events  in Spain and Portugal show that Europe is still unsettled.   Ofthis important  fact,  no stronger proof can  be adduced  than that the Allied  powers should have thought it proper, on any  principles satisfactory to  themselves,  to haveinterposed by force in  the internal concerns of Spain.   To what extent such inter-position may be carried on the same principle is a question in which all independentPowers,  whose Governments differ  from  theirs,  are  interested; even  those mostremote, and surely none  more so  than  the United  States.  Our policy in regard to europe, which was adopted at an  early  stage of the wars which have so long agitatedthat quarter of the globe, nevertheless remains  the same, which is not to interfere in the internal  concerns of any of its Powers: to consider the Government de factoas the legitimate Government for us: to cultivate friendly relations with it. and to preserve  those relations by a frank, firm and manly policy, meeting, in all instances.the just claims of every  Power, submitting to injuries from  none.  But in regardto these continents, circumstances are eminently and conspicuously different. It isimpossible that the Allied Powers should extend their political system to any portionof either Continent without endangering our peace and happiness: nor can  anyonebelieve that our southern brethren,  if left to themselves, would adopt it of theirown accord.  Tt is equally impossible,  therefore, that we should behold  such inter-position in any  form with indifference.   If we look to the comparative strength  and resources of Spain and those  new Governments and their distance from each other.it must be obvious  that she can never subdue them.  Tt  is still the true policy of theUnited States to leave  the parties to themselves, in the hope that other Powers  willpursue the same&apos; course.   Pronouncements by A merican Statesmen with regard to the Monroe Doctrine.    Mr. Hay in 1903 said in connection with the naval blockade of Venezuela by great  Britain, Germany and Italy, that &quot; the  United States could not object toforeign Powers taking steps against American countries to obtain redress forinjuries suffered by their subjects, provided that no acquisition  of territory  was contemplated.&quot;    In 1914  Mr. J. W. Foster (ex-Secretary of State) said :  &quot;The primary objectof the doctrine was, and is. to prevent the permanent occupation by European nations of any of the territory  of the American States  or the overthrow of their politicalinstitutions.   Succeeding  Administrations have repeatedly stated that european governments are free to make war on the American States or to resort to force tosupport their complaints, provided that they observe the two conditions above statedas to territory and  political institutions.&quot;    Mr. Root said in 1914 :  &quot; As the Monroe doctrine neither asserts nor involvesany right of control by the United States over any American nation, it imposes uponthe United States no duty towards European Powers to exercise such a control.&quot;    Mr. Hughes in 1928 declared that the Monroe doctrine  was &apos;* opposed (1) to anynon-American action encroaching  upon the political independence of  american states under any guise, and  (2) to the acquisition in  any manner of the control ofadditional territory in this hemisphere by any non-American Power.&quot;o
