FURTHER NOTE BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.

Short of drastic economy legislation, the following items represent  the mostextreme possibilities which can reasonably be imagined :                                                                      -000    Navy Estimates have still to find  1 050 millions of the  2 millions        originally  asked.  But on  further consideration of the First         Lord&apos;s proposals I.  do not press for  a reduction,  beyond the        amount mentioned above, of more than ...       ...             1,000    Air  Estimates  have been  considerably reduced,  allowing  for&apos;&apos;the        absorption of  Middle East  Defence expenditure,  but they        might be able to offer a further reduction of     ...       ...     250    Ministry of Health: A 5 per cent,  reduction  of  the proposed         provision  for Public Health Grants would yield   ...    -  ...     150    Empire Marketing Hoard: Temporary reduction of Million Grant         as in 1927 by ...       ...      ...      ...       ...       ...     500             This,  with their balance in hand, would leave them about         1  million available in 1928.             The Board cannot possibly spend even  half this sum in        that year.    Overseas Settlement: Further estimate reduction     ...       ...     100             This   still  gives   100,000 more than  the  Department         expects to spend this year.       (17172]
Treasury Chambers,  Whitehall, S.W. 1,         February 0, 1928.     War Graces Commission.: Reduction of provision for Endowment      -         Fund         ...       ...       ...       ...      ...       ...      75             Under my agreement of 1925 with the Secretary of State         for  War,  this provision  increases  in 1928  from   50,000 to          125,000.             There is  no reason why this increase should not be post-        ^         poned.   The money is not wanted.

Time  is. therefore, getting very short.                                                                   W. S. C.
