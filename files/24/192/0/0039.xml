THIS D0CU7. .SNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  &quot;AJBSTYtS government ;r .EiTT.ROAD CONVEYANCE OF PASSENGERS AND GOODS BY RAI^7AY CO:\PANIES.the Cabinet on 9th November last (Cabinet Conclusions 54(27)),I intimated to the representatives of the Railway Companieson the 10th November last that the Government intended togive general support to the Second Reading of these Billsbut that I should indicate to the Select Committee on the bills what amendments seemed, prima facie, desirable, andthat it would be necessary for the Government subsequently to consider whether the form in which the Bills emerged from the Committee was one that could be accepted.     2.   Since then the Bills have been introduced by theCompanies substantially in the form referred to in my previous Memorandum (c.P.26l (27).), and opposition, notonly from rival transport undertakings, but also from localauthorities and traders, has manifested itself on the linesv/hich I indicated in that Memorandum as being probable.  Asthe President of the Board of Trade has already stated,the personal views of the leaders of organised industriesappear to be more favourable to the Bills than the resolutions which such bodies have recently passed would suggest, and atthis stage petitioners naturally press all their points witha view to strengthening their handB in negotiating for&quot;safeguards&quot;.   At the same time, the opposition is more widespread than might have been anticipated, and inconnection with it there are two points in particular on which I desire to consult my colleagues.     3.   In the first place, it has been suggested, as ICABINET.MjajORAMDUM BY MINISTER OP TRANSPORT.In accordance with the decision arrived at by
exp9cted, &quot;by Important opponents of the proposals of theRailway Companiss that these proposals should not bs conceded in principle until some sort of inquiry has taken place.  TheFederation of British Industries, for example, have decided,failing success in their negotiations Yiith the Companies,to approach the Government with a request for a full inquirybefore the Bills receive a Second Reading.  The Cabinet hasalready decided that there is no reason to await the resultsof any further inquiry before the Railway Companies are granted a substantial extension of their existing powers to run road services, and while I think that this decision should b9adhered to, I am disposed at the same time to think that itmight be an advantage if I were in a position to say thatthe Government were not in principle averse from an inquiry into the question of usint all the various means of trar-sportin such a way as would be to the greatest public advantage,and that thsy would be prepared to consider the desirabilityof instituting such an inquiry at some later stage, if therewere general agreement as to its utility and scope.  Thereis, of course, a risk that even a tentative intimation of thiskind would be seized upon and pressed in certain quartersas a reason for deferring the Railv.&apos;ay Bills, and any definitepronouncement would, I think, inevitably have that effect.I, therefore, suggest that any statement should be very general in its terms, and to the effect t&apos;sat the Governmenthad not closed its mind to the Idea of an Inquiry into thepossibility of better co-ordination of the means of transportgenerally, but I should state plainly that the desirabilityof non-desirability of such an Inquiry was no reason whateveragainst the present bill.   -  4.   The seoond point is the possible risk that if the bills are laft to a free vote of the House they might be thrown out on Second Reading , notwithstanding the general
(intld.)   W,A,10.2.28.support which I have been authorised to give on behalfof the Government.  In these circumstances it appears tobe for consideration whether the Government Y/hips shouldnot be put on as tellers when the divisions on the SecondReadings of these Bills take place, so as to ensure thatthey are referred for full investigation to a Select Committee(preferably a Joint Committee of both Houses).     5.   Negotiations are known to be proceeding betweenthe Railway Companies and the traders organisations asto &quot;safeguards&quot; which might by agreement be embodied inthe Bills.  In my previous memoranda I have suggested thepoints which it may be desirable to raise on behalf ofthe Government.  With these it is unnecessary for me to trouble the Cabinet further, but some of them are not free from difficulty and in view of the special interests oftraders I should be glad if authority could be given tothe President of the Board of T?ade and myself to settle the precise lines of any statement or report to be madein regard to the obligations or restrictions which shouldbe attached in the Government&apos;s view to any powers grantedto the Railway Companies.
