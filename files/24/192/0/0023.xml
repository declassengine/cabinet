3.   It is for the Cabinet to decide whether thequestion of Poor Law Reform should be included in theXing&apos;s Speech.   If it is,the Government is therebycommitted to dealing with it.   On the other hand thereis no reason why the absence of any mention of the mattershoxild prevent its becoming a part of our legislative programme:  and if the Cabinet are of opinion thata few more weeks are required before they are definitelycommitted to some such scheme no embarrassment need be caused by its omission.     It is relevant, however, to point out in relationto the Widowsr Pensions scheme that the following sentence occurred in the King&apos;s Speech in      December, 1924:       &quot;My Ministers are engaged upon enquiries        into the possibility of combining with        existing systems of insurance, provisions        for improved old age pensions and pensions        for widowed mothers&quot;and a somewhat similar passage might te adopted in thepresent instance without our being ^ irretrievablycommitted.

We have considered in detail the time-table set out  in paper Po(28) 1st Conclusions. 3,     It is here restated for convenience  of reference -  1928 April        Budget Liquid Fuel Tax.

As regards tho proposed allocation of  the various parts of the scheme to tho throe  bills we would  observe that  thenational rate would normally be included in  the  finance bill and not in the Local Government Bill.   Ac  however  tho rate(THIS DOCUMENTJB THE PROPERTY OP EBBRITAHBIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) MOST CEO RET .                                             COPi NO, P.(26)  2o
would not  cone  into  force  until  October  1929,   it would Lsanomalous  to  include it  in the finance Bill  of  1920 - 1929,Postponenent  until the Finance Dill  of 1929  - SO would have certain  possibilities of inoonvenionco.   As the ValuationBill  has to be  passed quickly it  seems undesirable to includethe national  rats in that  Bill.    In the  circumstances it shouldbe included in  the local go vexramai t  bill  C3 proposed in thotime  table.   In order to  save time  in the passage of this bill,it m^y be  possible to include in  tho Budget resolutions of 1920the necessary ways end means resolution for the national rate.           Tho whole  scheme would  bo  set forth by tho chancellor in tho Budget speech, with a summary Indication of the stagesby which legislative effect is proposed to be given to it.There would be  no technical difficulty in so drafting the bills as to meke thorn dovetail into  each  other as pare of thesi-agle scheme.   Thus eg- the Valuation 3ill would boexpressed  to be passed with a view to providing for- thoexception  of the stated  classes of property from rating.Discussion on the bills would cover the same ground more than once but this is unavoidable.C.         It appeals?..&quot;3 to us that it will be necessary that all three bills should be practically ready by the time theBudget Speech is delivered.   The scheme will involve muchnegotiation with local authorities.   This cannot beginuntil after tho date of the budget speech and must  beeoraploxcd within a very limited period.    Experience  showsthat  in the case of  such a till as the  proposed  LooalOovemmcnt  Bill progress is likely to be  much quicker  ifit ii.: possible to base discussion with  the representativesof loeel authorities  on  ectual clauses  of a bill andespecially the clauses Sealing with tho most  importantelements of the scheme.&apos; - *
 9-        We are advised that if the three bills and especially the Local Government Bill are to be ready as above proposed, it will be necessary that a docision as to the principles of the scheme shall be taken by the Cabinet at the very earliest possible moment and that the Parliamentary Counsel shall have a general authority enabling him, so far as he finds it necessary, to give these bills precedence over the  nunerous other bills in the programmes recently submitted by Ministers for Cabinet consideration.          VTe think that it will be found impossible to make sufficient progress with the negotiations with losal authorities as to enable the Local Government Bill to be introduced in June as proposed in the time-table and that it will be safer to take July as the date of its introduction. This need not prejudice the placing of the bill on the statute book by December. Qr       Scotland as well as England and Wales would be dealt with in the 3&apos;finance Bill as regards the Liquid fuel Tax and the national Rate and in the Valuation Bill as regards ascertainment of properties to be exempted. fo.       As regards the third Bill - the Local Government Bill - a separate Bill for Scotland wquid probably be required,- &apos;         That Bill would deal with/the Rate Exemption, the Assigned Revenues, the Grants in lieu of these and of the existing Public Health Grants.  It might also dealwith the transference cf roads to County Councils should this policy of transfer be found expedient and feasible. fj^      l&apos;.c scheme for reform of Local Government administra- tion in Scotland hss yet been forraul-eted and it is understood that in the view of the Scottish Office the Bill should not contain any provisions to this end.
13.The Bill would x-oqairo to make provision for thedistribution of the now Grants.14.The problem of a satisfactory formula for thisdistribution presents special difficulties, but theco arcbeing examined.12c Table, might be brought to a close at tho end of July and a new session begun in October or early in November.   Ifthis courso commends itself to the Cabinet, the first two bills(ioG. the Finance and the Y-..l\iation Bills) would be passed in tho Summer fox* England and Scotland, and tho local Govemmant3ills for England and Scotland would be introduced as tho firstlegislative measures in the new Session.16.    It would in that event be difficult to pass the latter1bills through all their stages before Christmas and it wouldbe necessary to assume that thoy might not become law till,say Easter 1929.   The effect would then be that the changesin local Government contemplated in England would not take effect till the 1st of October, 1930 although the provision as to rate exemption v/ould be In operation from October 1929.Wo do not however anticipate that any insurmountable difficulty would result from this.till say November would give moi^o time for drafting themeasures and for the necessary negotiations with localauthorities.  On the other h&quot;-nd it would provide increasedopportunities for criticism and tho organisation of oppositionon the part especially of the smaller local authorities.fcornafive 15. aboveIt has boon suggested that the next Session of Parliament17.Delaying the introduction of the Local Government BillsSigned on behalf of the Departmental            Committee.W.
