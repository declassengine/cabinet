This Document is the Property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.CP. 13 (1928).Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1928.              1 08                                                     SOPROPOSED AMENDMENT OE THE PENSIONS (GOVERNORS OF               DOMINIONS)  ACTS. 1911 AND 1913.     MEMORANDUM  BY THE ACTING SECRETARY OF STATIC FOR THE COLONIES.    IT has been apparent for some time that the pre-war legislation providing forthe pensions of Colonial Governors  is unsatisfactory in many respects in the light of modern conditions, and in April. 1927. Mr. Amery appointed a Committee to review the situation and to  make recommendations for improving the position  of Governorswith special reference to the question of pensions.    The  report of  this Committee (on which the  Treasury was represented)  is annexed and I shall be glad if the Cabinet will agree to the preparation of a draftBill to give effect  to their recommendations.  As some of the grievances which it isnow proposed  to remedy are  of long standing I hope that  facilities may  be givenfor the passage of the Bill at the earliest possible date.                                                                  W. 0.-G.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,           January 24, 1928.       REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE  ox  POSITION OF COLONIAL GOVERNORS.To the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Sir,    WE were appointed  by you in April, 1927,  as a Committee  with the following terms of reference :          &quot;To  consider the question  of the position of Colonial Governors, and the    existing conditions of service  as affecting especially the scales of pension to be    assigned to Governors to whom the Pensions (Governors of Dominions, &amp;c.) Act,    1911, applies, and to make recommendations as to any revision of the pension    scheme or other terms of service which may be desirable, and as to the inclusion    in the pension scheme of Governors, &amp;c, to whom the Act of  1911 does not at    present apply.&quot;    2.  The members of the Committee were as follows :          The Right  Honourable, the Earl Buxton, G.C.M.G. (Chairman).         The Right Honourable W. Ormsby-Gore,  M.P.  (Parliamentary  Under-            Secretary of State for  the Colonies).         Sir R, Russell Scott, K.C.B., C.S.I.  (Treasury).         Sir Robert Hamilton, M.P.         Sir John A. R. Marriott,  M.P.         Mr. Henry Snell, M.P.         Mr. C. J. Jeffries (Colonial Office), Secretary.    3.  We have met on seven occasions, and  have had the benefit of receivingevidence  from  the following gentlemen :          Brigadier-General  Sir  Samuel  Wilson,   K.C.B.,  K.C.M.G.,  K.B.E.,            Permanent  Under-Secretary of  State  for the Colonies, and formerly            Governor of Jamaica and Governor of Trinidad.         Sir  Graeme  Thomson, G.C.M.G.,  K.C.B., Governor of  Nigeria and            formerly Governor of British Guiana.         Sir Horace Byatt, K.C.M.G., Governor of Trinidad and  formerly Governor            of the  Tanganyika Territory.         Sir Herbert  Stanley,  K.C.M.G., Governor of  Northern Rhodesia and            Governor-designate of  Ceylon.         Sir Donald Cameron, K.C.M.G., K.B.E.,  Governor of  the Tanganyika            Territory.      [17093]                                                        B
                               Present Position.    4.  The existing  position of  Colonial  Governors under  the pension schemeprovided in the Act of 1911  may be summarised as follows:     (a.) Governorships are divided for pension purposes  into  four  classes,  each with its separate scale of pension.    The rates of pensions assignable to each class are not dependent on the salariesreceived by the Governor during his period of office, as the rates of Governors&apos; salariesvary  considerably  according to local  circumstances,  and  the  importance  of  aGovernors position  is not  by any means always represented by  the rate of salaryattached to the Governorship.    Every completed month of service in any class (subject to (/;) and (c) below) earnspension in addition to any  pension earned by previous civil service (Home.  Colonial.or Indian), as follows :-        Class   I  ...   5  (i.e.,  60 a year for each year of service).        Class  II  ...   4  [i.e.,  48 a year for each year of service).        Class III  ...   3  (i.e.,  30 a year for each year of service).        Class IV  ...   2  (i.e.,  24 a year for each year of service).    (b.) The maximum total pension payable from all sources is  1,300;  and if a governor  were entitled to pension from other sources of  1.300 or upwards,  he would draw no Governors pension.    (c.) No Governors pension is payable unless the Governor  has completed tenyears&apos; service as such, and has either reached the age of 60  or is retiring  inconsequence of ill-health, abolition of office, or the inability of the Secretary of state to offer him further employment.  In the last-mentioned case the pension is subjectto a reduction of 5 per cent, for each year  by which the Governors age falls short of 60. subject to a maximum reduction of 50 per cent.     (d.) Provision,  however, exists  under Section 5 (1) of  the Act for a Governorwho has not served as a Governor for ten years,  but  who has had previous civil-service either at home or in the Colonies, and who retires on account of age, ill-health or abolition of office, to reckon his Governors service towards  a  pension calculated in accordance with the Superannuation Acts and  based on his  final civil serviceemoluments.     5. It has been represented to us  that under these arrangements not only arethe  scales  of pension  themselves  inadequate, but that  the existing   statutoryrestrictions hamper the freedom of the Secretary of State in making such changesin personnel as may be necessary from  time to time in  the public interest.  In thisReport we have  formulated  our recommendations for the amendment  of the law soas to effect what  appears to us a reasonable improvement in these respects.                      Classification and Rates of Pension.    6.  We are agreed that the present system by which Governorships are dividedinto four classes should be retained.    Since the existing scales of pension were framed, however, the rates of pension which can be drawn by Colonial civil servants generally have considerably increased,with the result that an Officer of the class from which Governors are usually drawn,such as the Colonial Secretary of one of the larger Colonies, may actually suffer loss in pension prospects by exchanging his civil service appointment for a Governorship.For example, the Chief Secretary to the Government of  Nigeria earns pension atthe rate of  63 15s. a year, while the Governor himself (a Class I Governor) earnspension at the  rate of only  60 a year.  Further, Sir Donald Cameron, who waspromoted  from the  Chief  Secretaryship  of Nigeria  to  the  Governorship of tanganyika  (Class II), is earning pension in the latter post at  the rate  of  only 48 a year  instead of  63 15s.   For this reason,  and in  view of the fact that the
 intrinsic importance and responsibility of most Governorships have much increased since 1911, we recommend :      (a.) That the units of pension for each month of service in the various classes should be as follows :          Class   I  ...   6  (i.e.,  72 a year for each year of service).    - -   Class  II  ...   5  (i.e.,  60 a year for each year of service).         Class III  ...   4  (i.e.,  48 a year for each year of service).         Class IV  ...   3  (i.e.,  36 a year for each year of service).    (b.)  That the total pension to  be drawn from all sources should  not exceed 2.000 a year.    7.  We  further recommend that any Governor with  ten years&apos; or more service as such, whose Governors service was immediately preceded by civil service at home or in  the. Colonies, and who is retired on account of age or ill-health or abolition of office, should be entitled to reckon his Governors service towards a pension calculated in accordance with the Superannuation Acts, and based on his final civil serviceemoluments (as provided at present in Section 5 (I) of the Act of 1911 in the case of governors with  less than ten years&quot; service as such),  if  this would be more to hisadvantage than the grant of an ordinary Governors pension.                               Qualifying Period.    8.  We do not consider that the ten years&apos; qualifying period should be abrogated.But we have carefully considered the question  whether a  pension should not begranted in cases where the Secretary of State  has come to the conclusion that in thepublic interest it is not desirable to continue the employment of a Governor  who hasnot completed his ten years&apos; service.  We recognise that cases must arise from time totime in which there may be considerable difficulty in allowing a  Governor  to complete the qualifying period  of ten years, when experience  has shown that he  does not possess the particular combination of qualities which is necessary for success in suchan appointment.  In such a case the Secretary of State is faced with the disagreeablealternatives of leaving an Officer who has served  the State to the best of his abilitywithout employment or pension derived from the years he has completed as Governor,or of continuing  the Officer in his employment although  this is not in the best interestof the State.    9.  We  are of opinion that it is necessary,  in order to remove this anomaly,to provide  that some pension shall be  available for a  Governor with previous civilservice who  retires before completing  ten  years&apos;  Governors  service  and before reaching the age of 60, on the ground that the Secretary  of State is unable to offerhim further employment.  It must be remembered that such an officer, if he had not accepted a Governorship, would have continued to qualify during the period coveredby his Governorship for additional pension in respect of each year of service in his existing post. We recommend,  therefore, that Section 5  of the Act of  1911, underwhich a Governor with less than ten years  service as  such, but with previous civilservice,  is allowed to count his Governors service for pension as though it were civilservice,  should be amended  so as to permit of the award thereunder of a  reducedpension to a Governor with less than 10 years&apos; service as such who is retired on publicgrounds  before reaching  the age  of 60.  This reduction should be at  the rate of5 per cent, for each year by which his age on retirement falls short of 60, subject to amaximum reduction of 50 per cent. :  provided, however,  that  if he has  reached an age at which retirement without a medical certificate  would have been  permissibleunder the regulations applicable to his last civil service  post, and if his Governorshiphas been served in an unhealthy climate, the deduction  should be limited to such anamount as will so far as practicable secure the same pension as he would have earnedif he  had continued to  serve in his last civil  service post.    10.  We have, also carefully considered the cases of Governors who prior to theirappointment have not  been employed  in the  permanent  civil service of the State andby reason of their not having completed ten years&apos; service as Governor cannot qualify for the award of a pension.    We have come to  the conclusion  that any alteration  in the pension  Law whichwould entitle such persons to receive, a pension at the  end of their service  would beopen  to grave objection.  It involves an entirely new departure in pension  practice,and would  open the door to claims on the part of other persons holding salaried       T17093]                                                       B  2
offices under the Crown which do not qualify for pension from public funds.  It mustbe remembered that in such cases the Governor is aware of the position as regardssalary and pension when he accepts office.  In these circumstances, the majority ofthe Committee consider that a provision of this  kind  would not be suitable.   one member of the Committee, however, wished to record his dissent from this view, andhis opinion that  the present  system involves in practice  the restriction of suchGovernorships to men with private resources, whereas such offices should be equallyopen to all subjects of the Crown.                                  Gratuities.    11.   We have considered  the question whether Governors should be permitted to receive a portion of their pension in the form  of a lump sum  gratuity.  We find that in most cases those who have had previous civil service are enabled to receive apart of their civil service pension in the form of a lump sum.  Pensions granted underSection 5  (1) of the Act of 1911 also contain a lump sum element, and it is proposedin paragraph  7 above to give Governors who have completed ten years&apos; service assuch the option of being treated in accordance with that section.  We do not, there-fore, consider it necessary to make  any further provision to secure a lump sumcommutation payment to a Governor on retirement.    12. We have also considered the question whether provision for a death gratuityto dependents should be included in the pension scheme for Governors generally, andnot limited, as at present, to Governors recruited  from the. Home Civil Service.  Werecommend that the privilege should be extended  by providing that, on the death inthe Service of a Governor who was previously serving in a Colonial civil service post,the Exchequer should pay to his estate the amount of any death gratuity which wouldhave been  payable by the Colonial Government if he had died in his last civil servicepost.                                    Leave.    13.   We understand that, under present arrangements, Governors  in tropical africa are allowed to count as pensionable service time spent on leave and passagesnot exceeding the  normal vacation  leave of a civil servant serving in the Colonyconcerned, but that no provision exists for the reckoning of sick leave additional to ordinary vacation leave.   We  recommend that Governors in these  Colonies shouldbe allowed to count for pension any  period of absence which could be so countedunder the  regulations applicable to civil servants in the Colony concerned.                                Unemployment.    14.   We have had before us particulars of  certain cases in which,  owing tounavoidable circumstances,  Governors  with  previous   civil service  have  beenunemployed for considerable periods between the termination of one Governorshipand the beginning of the next.  Under existing arrangements  no salary is availablefor such Governors, and though such cases are few in number, the lack of provisionfor them clearly constitutes a severe  hardship to the individuals concerned.   It is hardly possible in such cases to expect that the Colony in which the Governor was last employed should provide funds for his payment while he remains out of employ -ment.  We suggest, therefore, that the necessary provision to meet such cases shouldtake the form of a grant from the Exchequer for a period not exceeding 12 monthsof an amount equivalent  to the pension which would  have become  payable  to theofficer concerned if instead of being placed on  the unemployed list he  had beenretired from the service.                                   General.    15.  We recommend that power should  be taken to apply the provisions  of the governors&apos; Pensions Law to Mandated  Territories.    16.  We recommend  tfyat any changes  in the rates  and conditions of pension which may be made as a  result of this report should not apply to persons who havealready left the service, but should apply, generally speaking&quot;, retrospectively to allGovernors who are in the  service at the time when the changes are introduced.  Weconsider,  however, that provision should be made in a special case which has beenbrought to our notice,  of a Governor who recently retired  and  who, owing  to the
anomaly mentioned in paragraph 8 above, has received no pension.  Further, we donot intend that our recommendations should lie applied retrospectively to Governorsstill serving so as in any way to prejudice the impartial consideration of any specialor individual claims submitted by them in respect of their past service, which mightlx* adversely affected if our proposals were automatically applied retrospectively insuch a case.    17.  Our attention  was drawn to the question of including in the pensionableservice of a  Governor any periods during which he may, on the instructions of theSecretary of State, have been absent from his Colony on duty.  It was understood,however, that the  provisions of Section 10 of the Act of 1911 had been foundsufficient to cover this point.    18.  We also considered whether, in the case of Governors serving  in colonies on the &quot;unhealthy list&quot; some climatic allowance should not lie made (as in  the caseof civil servants) in the  calculation of pension.  It  was. however, pointed out thatGovernors  in  unhealthy Colonies were, as a  rule, subjected to considerably  lessclimatic strain than the average civil servant: and that climatic  conditions were taken into account in the classification of Governorships.  The short-service Governorin an unhealthy  Colony already receives climatic addition, while other Governorswill, under the proposal in  paragraph 7 of this report,  be able to avail themselves of it.  if they elect for  pension  based  on final civil service  emoluments.  In  thecircumstances we have decided to make no  recommendation on this point.    19.  The  question of &quot;entertainment&quot; allowance was raised, i.e., whether itwas adequate in cases where the calls on the Governor were heavy, and whether the allowance granted  in respect of the various Colonies should  not be reviewed fromtime to time. We came  to the conclusion that the question was outside our terms ofreference.    20.  We have  received  representations to the effect that Governors  have founddifficulty in  discovering  in what  Class their appointments were included  for pensionpurposes.   This information is  public,  as the Order  for the classification is laidbefore Parliament.  To  avoid misunderstanding, however, we  recommend that everyGovernor should  be informed, on receiving the offer of  appointment, of the  Classin which his Governorship is included.    21.  We have also received  representations to the effect that there is sometimesconsiderable delay  in calculating and awarding pensions.  Any complaints of thiskind have doubtless arisen out of cases in which a rapid settlement has been impossibleowing to the complications attendant on the  calculation of pensions  in respect ofservice in various territories. We understand  that in sfich cases it is the practice togrant a provisional alimentary allowance if the officer concerned applies for one.    22.  We are much indebted to our Secretary. Mr. C. J. Jeffries,  for the efficienthelp which he has given to us.                                     We have the honour to be.
