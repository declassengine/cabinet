J 10-1)), namely     (a)  Is the integrity of Afghanistan, I will not say essential, but  as important         now as when, in 1003, 1905 and 1907, the statements were made which are         quoted by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on page 37?    (b)  If so, may we still  assume, as was  assumed  in 1907,  that  &quot; the deliberate         crossing  of  the Oxus or the occupation  of  Herat  by  Russia  would be         followed  by a declaration of war against that Power&quot;?   If  not, at what         point does a casus  belli arise?     (e)  (,&quot;an we expect to  inflict on  Russia in the Afghan theatre a series of  defeats         so  decisive  that she will be content,  to make peace on terms  which will         permanently relieve  Afghanistan  from  the  menace  of invasion and  the         British  Rinpire from the menace of war on that account?    (d)  If we cannot, in what, theatre  of operations is the decision to be sought?    (e)  If the answers to questions (a) and (/*) are  in the aflirmativo, can  anything         he done beforehand  to  reduce to a minimum the risk of Russian absorption         of Northern Afghanistan  and the  undesirable consequences that  would         follow thereupon ?    (/)  In the event of  Russian aggression, what should  be our plan of campaign,         and, in particular,  should it include operations  in Northern Afghanistan?    (q)  What, immediate  preparations, if any, are necessary (i) in  India, (ii) at  home ?    (h)  To what extent  is  the co-operation  of the Amir  necessary  for the purpose         of (/)? and    (2)  To report generally on the situation.  &quot; Lord lloatty wished it to bo uu record that his association with tho Coin milieu was in commotionwith any broad  strategical questions that  might aviso out of the local problem and generally from thepoint of view of tho Committee of Chiefs of Staff.

ooREPORT.                                 I. Introduction.   From the foregoing terms  of  reference it  will be seen that our first task  is toconsider whether the integrity of Afghanistan is as important  to-day as it  was in1903, 1905 and  1907, when  the subject was considered by our  predecessors.  this problem governs, and  is inseparably bound up with, the remaining items  of our terms of Reference, and  we cannot  introduce the subject in  its broad lines betterthan by quoting the following statements :                                       1903.   Extract from a report by the Committee of  Defence under the Chairmanship of                             Mr.  (JIOZW Lord) Half our.          - 0          0           &amp;          0         0           0   &quot; Afghanistan is not  merely,  perhaps  not chiefly,  valuable to  us as a  &apos; bufferStale,&apos; a State prepared  to  take  the first brunt of aggression.  It is also valuablebecause, in its present condition,  and so  long as  it possesses few  roads and  norailways, it will be impossible for Russia to  make effective use of her great numericalsuperiority at any point immediately vital to the Empire.   &quot;it  is on this argument that the  advocates of a  &apos; backward &apos;  frontier policy  havechiefly relied.   And as far as it goes the argument  is unanswerable.  But it  retainsits full  value  only  so  long as the conditions  of supply and transport between theRussian  and  British territories remain  unchanged;  and  they certainly  would not remain unchanged in any part,  of  Afghanistan or  Persia which came  for a sufficientlength of time under Russian control.   &quot;The very arguments, therefore, which show that India  is now almost unassailableshow  also that, if it is to remain so, Afghanistan must,  remain  un-Rnssianised.  Andit would be possible to express  the military significance of every important advancewhich Russian predominance might  make to the south and south-east beyond her present  frontier in terms of the additional men it would require to defend our own.&quot;                                      1905.  Extract from a Statement by Mr. (now Lord) Half our in the House of Commons on                                 11th May 1905.          0           0          0           0           0           0   &quot; It ought, in  my opinion, to be considered as au act of direct aggression upon this country that  any attempt  should  he made to build a railway in connection withthe Russian strategic  railways within the territory of Afghanistan.  ...  I thinkit would  be the heaviest blow directed  at the very heart of  our Indian Empire thatwe  could conceive.   .  .  .   If, however, by laxity, by blindness, by cowardice, weadmit the slow absorption of the Afghan kingdom in the way that  we have necessarilypermitted the absorption of the various Khanates in Central Asia ;  if Russian strategicrailways  are allowed to creep  closer and closer to the frontier which we are bound todefend, then this country will inevitably pay for its supineness by having to keep on foota much larger army than anything which  any  of us can contemplate with equanimity.Foresight and courago will obviate  these dangers; without foresight  and without.courage they may come upon us;  and if they  do come upon us, we shall bo throwingupon  our  children, if not upon ourselves, the greatest  military problem that has probably ever confronted the Government  of this country.&quot;                        * Ropvoduuocl as C.I.U.

The Report  of Lord .Morley&apos;s Sub-Committee was considered by the  Committeeof Imperial Defence on the 30th May 1007.  The relevant extract from the  Minutes ofthat meeting! is as follows :     &quot;The  Pin ME MIXISTEUJ  read to the Committee a summary of the recommendations contained in the report, which are as follows :      &quot;(1)  That  Russian  aggression   into  Afghanistan should  be  followed  by a         declaration of war  against that Power;     &quot; (2)  That the Indian Army should then proceed  to occupy               &quot; (a)  Kabul  and Kandahar, if the  Amir and tribes are friendly:              &quot; (6) Jalalabad and Kandahar, if  the Amir and tribes are hostile.     &quot; (3)  That,  simultaneously,  the  railways  on the north-west  frontier  should  be         prolonged as far in the direction of those places as possible.     &quot; (1)  That to  enable these measures to be taken               &quot; ia)  The  railways should  be gradually completed  in  peace time  to           Parachinar and Smatsai.              &quot; (A) The Indian Field Army  should  be so organised  as  to  provide           nine divisions and eight  cavalry brigades within the next six or  seven           years.              &quot; (c) The military organisation of Great Britain  should  be such as  to           enable 100,000 men to be despatched  to India during the first year of war.              &quot; (d)  The Indian Government should make preparations to  receive the           number of reinforcements specified in the evidence given by Sir Beauchamp           Duff before the Sub-Committee.&quot; CONCLUSION :     &quot; (a) The Committee accept the principles laid down by the Sub-Committee as a         general guide to the policy to he adopted in the event of  Russian aggression          directed  against India.&quot;           0           &amp;           &amp;           0           0           0    3. It  is of historical  interest to note how closely the above statements of policyconform  to the  following passage in  a letter^ written by Lord Palmerston  in  1840.&quot; It seems pretty clear that, sooner or later, the Cossack and the Sepo3*, the man fromthe Baltic and he from tho British Islands, will meet  in the centre of Asia.   It shouldbe our  business to take care that the meeting should take place as far off from ourIndian  possessions as may be convenient and  advantageous to us.  But the  meetingwill not be avoided by our staying at home to receive the visit.&quot;
    -1. Tho unanimity  reached in  the above inquiries is impressive.  Among those associated  with Mr. Ralfouv in  his inquiry at the Committee of  Imperial  Defence inthe early years of this century were Lord Selborno, Air. Brodrick (now Lord Midloton),and the late Field  Marshal  Lord Roberts.  Among the.  signatories to the Report ofLord Morley&apos;s Sub-Committee of L907 were I/ml  Morley himself, Lord  Oxford andAsquith,  Lord Grey,   Lord  Haldaue,  Lord  fisher and  Lord  French.   Sir HenryCampbell-Bannerman  presided  at the meeting at which the Report  was approvedby  the Committee of Imperial Defence, and himself presented the important summaryof its conclusions  already quoted.  At all stages of our  investigation we  have given careful consideration to the (itidings of these weighty and exhaustive inquiries.    o. As  the  foundation  of  our  inquiry we  had before us various documents whichhad already boon circulated to  the  Committee of Imperial Defence, including  thedespatches  of  the Government of India,  Nos,  9 and 10, of  7th October  1926, withenclosures from the Indian General Staff (O.I.I). Paper No. J-19 I)), two despatches  of21st February 192&quot; from  Sir Francis  f fumplirys (C.I.D. Paper No.  152 D),  as  well  asthe Minutes of the 220th and 223rd Meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence,at which preliminary consideration had been given to this problem.   In addition, intho course of our inquiry, we have ourselves obtained a number of valuable documentsfrom the Departments concerned.   A  complete list of these is attached as Appendix I.    0. We have also received the greatest assistance from  a number of witnesses, who,up  to the  present time, have included the  -Marquess of Heading, Field Marshal Earlllaig, Sir  Francis liuniphrys (the British Minister in Kabul), Sir Denys Bray (foreign secretary  to the Government of  India). Lieut.-Gen. Sir Andrew  Skeen (the Chief ofthe  Indian  General  Staff),  General Sir George Rirkpatrick (lately commanding  theWestern Commaud in India), Sir Basil Blackett. (Finance Member of the Council ofthe Governor-General of India), and Sir Robert  Hodgson (lately His Majesty&apos;s Charged&apos;Alfaires at Moscow).   A complete list of  witnesses is attached as Appendix II.    7. We have held 13 meetings.                            II. Historical Retrospect.    S. The present phase of the Afghan problem  in  relation to the defence of Indiacannot lie appreciated without reference to the events  which  preceded it.    9. During  the latter years  of tho last,  ami  the earlier years of the  present,century, Russia&apos;s advances in tho direction of the Indian frontier were a constant source of anxiety.  But almost  immediately after the  Report&quot; of 1907 the  tension  relaxed.For on  31st August 1907 the Anglo-Russian Conventiouf was signed.   Russia andGreat  Britain  became  good  friends  in diplomacy; the  risks of  a  quarrel for  themoment at  least  disappeared, and Russia&apos;s  designs on India ceased to  be the objectof a continuous scrutiny.    In May 191.7, during the  Great War, came the Russian Revolution, the fall of  theCzarist  regime and  the repudiation  of Czarist treaties.  The security  afforded  bythe  1907  Convention  was  thus  dissipated; but, on  the other  hand,  the Bolshevikleaders were preoccupied  with their own domestic  problems, and Russia for the timebeing ceased to be formidable as a military Power.   The Russian factor was for  themoment eliminated from India&apos;s defence problems.   And so,  in 1919, when  theGovernment of India came  to consider the question of the numbers and constitutionof  the  forces that  were to be  maintained for  the discharge  of  purely  Indianresponsibilities, the maximum external danger  to which  India seemed to  be  exposedwas war with Afghanistan in combination  with tho frontier tribes.    It. is on this standard that the state of preparedness  for war of the Indian Armyand Royal Air Force is still based.    10. It  was not until later  that  apprehension  in relation  to Russia  revived.Towards  tho  end of  .1925  an  acute- Russo-Afghan  crisis  arose  over the  forcibleoccupation  by the Russians  of Drta  Tagai, an  island in  the River Oxus,  which had for  many  years been  in  the de  facto possession  of the Afghans.  Afghan  amourpropre was  inflamed, and  it  seems possible  that  but for   the restraining influenco of  &quot; Signed on 1st -May 1907.  t See Twenty Five Years,&quot; by Lord Grey, Vol. I, page 15!).  &quot;Tho cardinal British object in tlte.senegotiations was  to secure ourselves for over, as far as a treaty could secure us, from further Russianadvances in tho direction  of tho Indian frontier   ....  (liy tho treaty) wo wore freed from  ananxiety that had  often pro-oeoupiod British Governments   ....  Tho prospect of peace was made more secure.&quot;
Sir Francis Huinphrys, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul, the King would have adopted the suicidal course or  declaring war on Russia.  This  particular storm blew over, butit brought into prominence the necessity for a searching examination of the  largerquestions which lay behind  it.  If Russian  policy  in Asia was  to hem in India witha circle of Bolshevik States, and if  northern  Afghanistan was destined to be the nextregion to be drawn into the orbit of  the U.S.S.H., what was  to be the policy of Great Britain ?   Was it essential for the -safety of  India  that wc should actively intervene to  prevent any violation of Afghanistan&apos;s integrity ?  And,  if so, what  stops  shouldbe taken now, and in the future, to render our  intervention possible and effective?After a preliminary examination by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and  by theCommittee  of Imperial  Defence, the  whole question was  referred for  exhaustiveinquiry by the Sub-Committee which has prepared this report.                          III. Review of the Situation.    11. Before  addressing ourselves to the solution of the problem which has been presented to us, it  is necessary to review  its  principal  factors.  It is especiallynecessary to  indicate  the nature and extent of the changes  which have  taken place-since the subject was  last examined  ; for it  is on account of certain of  these changes that the Government of India advocate a modification of our established policy.  we will pass to these after a brief description  of the more permanent elements  in theproblems.    12. In the first place, certain geographical features of the country must be  brieflyconsidered.   The  most important physical  feature in Afghanistan is  the mountainmass of the Hindu Kush and Koh-i-baba, which separates one-third of Afghanistan inthe  north  from the remaining two-thirds in  the south.  In the  west the mountainsgradually merge into  the plain which connects Herat and Kandahar.  If one exceptsthe route connecting these two places, communications  between northern ami southernAfghanistan are restricted  to  the passes through the Hindu Kush.  Of such  routesthere are half-a-dozen.  All of them converge on Kabul; and all but one, or perhapstwo, are  snow-bound  throughout   the  winter.   The northern provinces  may  be described as the granary of  Afghanistan, and contribute  by far the greater portion ofthe land revenue of the country.  Kabul, the seat of government, has been described as &quot; the key of Afghanistan, the great strategical point of the country, the centre ofits power and of all its communications.&quot; The description is still true.    13. Communications  in Afghanistan itself  are still very primitive.  There  are norailways;  and the  only roads which are  fit even for cart transport, are the following :-    (a) Landi Khaua to Kabul, 160 miles.  Partly metalled, passable for motor traffic         and open throughout the year.    (6) Kabul  to Tcrmez in Afghan  Turkestan :                (i)  Vid the Unai and  Bamiau Passes, 340  miles.  Could  easily be           made fit for  carts and light motor traffic.   Closed from January to April           by snow.               (ii)  Vid the  Khawak Pass, 3G0 miles.   Fit  for pack transport only,           although portions now unfit  for wheels could  be improved very readily for           the purposes of light transport.   Winter snows only block this route for a           day or so at a time.     (c) Kandahar to Kabul, 310 miles.   Passable for carts and light motors and open         throughout the year.     ((/) Chaman-Kandahar-Iierat,  41V  miles.  Passable  for  heavy lorries between         Chaman  and Kandahar (711  miles).  Between Kandahar anil  Herat it is         passable for wheels, but several tinbridged rivers must be passed.    ft is significant  that  the  Russians have  recently surveyed a  direct road frontopposite Terme/.,  through Mazar-i-Sharif to  Kabul ovor  the Hindu  Kush vid theSalang or Zemistan Pass.  This will take about 21 years to build, but will be Oo milesshorter than the Khawak route.    At the present  time, however, it  may be said that the &quot;non-conducting &quot; qualities of Afghan territory are much as they were in 1007.    14. But although  railways  have  not  yet penetrated  Afghanistan itself,  the improvements  in the railway communications  of Russia, and, in a smaller degree, ofIndia, tip to tho Afghan borders merit attention.    Tho broad-gauge  railways of Russia now  lead  to two railheads on  tho Afghanborder, viz. to Kushlc Post, SO miles  (by road) north of Herat, and  to Termez on  the
right,  bunk of tho Oxus, 3-10 miles (by road) north-west of Kabul.   The former line(which existed in 1007; branches oil  from  the  Trans-Caspian railway at :Merv ;  thelatter is a recently-built branch oT  the line which Russia has gradually extended fromOrenburg m Tashkent, and thence  through Samarkand and Bokhara (Kagan), to joinup  with  the  Trans-Caspian  railway at Charjui  (now called  Leninsk).   There are,therefore, now two separate lines of railway communication available between european russia and the northern frontier of Afghanistan.  The positions of the two railheadsare a  sufficient  indication  at the  intentions  with  which  these lines  have beeuconstructed.    Un the Indian frontier the two main broad-gauge&apos;  railheads are at Landi Khana,the western entrance of the  Khyber  Pass, which is  I GO miles (by  road) from Kabul,and at Chaman,  which is 70 miles from Kandahar.   There is a  third railhead  atDuzdab,  near  the point where the Indian, Afghan and  Persian borders meet.  this line, which joins the main  Indian railway  system near Quotta, was extended fromNushki iluring the Great War to supply the  British force operating in Eastern Persia.It would  be  of importance in the event of a Russian  invasion through Persia andSistan.    15. If we  pass for a moment to ethnography, I he population of Afghanistan is nothomogeneous.  It is broken up into clans, not all belonging to one race, nor speakingone tongue, nor  even professing the  same tenets of  the Moslem faith.  In the norththe population is  largely non-Afghan, being lor the most part composed of Turkomans,Uzbegs, and Tajiks, who are  racial affinities  of the inhabitants of  the adjacent SovietRepublics of Turkmanistan,  Uzbokia,  ami Tajikistan.  It  is lo  be noted, however,that some of  the principal Afghan nobles have their homes, or possess lands, in the territories north  of the Hindu Kush, and  that  the  King,  like his  predecessors, iscareful to see that a due proportion of Afghan  tribesmen is domiciled in  the north.In the south the population  is wholly Afghan, and consists of Duranis, Ghilzais, andPathans of the south;  whilst in central Afghanistan there are the  llazaras, a tribe ofMongolian origin, Shiahs by faith, and  bitterly opposed to Afghan rule.    16. The characteristics of the Afghan are still much the same as they have alwaysbeen  -vanity ; a passionate love of freedom easily degenerating into licence ; treacheryand greed, a little redeemed by coinage.    As regards the general  attitude  of  I he educated  Afghan towards  Russia and ourselves, he believes that he is entitled, by  his geographical  position, to play off theone against the other, and to extract the maximum benefit from each ;  and he is neverso happy as when tempting one rival to bid against the other,   lie  regards Russiawith grave distrust, but at the same time misses  no opportunity of making  use of her,partly owing  to greed, and partly to show Great  Britain that she is not alone in thefield.   By the official classes Great Britain is regarded with mixed feelings.  On theone hand they charge her with land-grabbing and with having enslaved the greaterpart of the Mohammedan world ;  on the other, they have a profound admiration forBritish world diplomacy and  Tor His Majesty&apos;s Government  in London.  As  regardsthe Government of  India, they are unable to forget  the events which led up  to thethree Afghan wars;  and, in  particular, they cannot understand India&apos;s reluctance to spend money on Afghanistan.    The  tribesmen who live  in  the south,  and theuneducated  classes generally,  regard the  Englishman as  on the  whole  the  mostpromising of  the  infidels with whom they have acquaintance.    As regards martial  qualities  the inhabitants of the north tire, broadly speaking,unwarlike and submissive; those of the south are of formidable lighting material.    17. No description  of xn&apos;csent-lay conditions in Afghanistan  would be completewithout a brief sketch of the reigning King.   King Amanulla is 3-1 years of age.  lieis proud, impulsive,  anil gifted with a vivid imagination.  His  personality  is not without attraction, and he is cleverer than any of his Ministers.  He is surrounded bysycophants who  neither dare tell  him  the truth nor  oppose hie prejudices.  He haspreserved his despotism almost intact under  a camouflage of  democratic institutions;and he differs perhaps  unaeceptably from his predecessors in having only one wife and in working 10  hours a day.   His father used to  disappear into the  harem forweeks at a time  and  do  no other work  of any description.  The  King&apos;s zeal formodern  reform has, however, rather seriously  outrun  his resources,  and this  has caused much  alarm to Afghans of the old school.  He has accomplished somethingduring the  eight years of  his reign, although  much apparent progress is onlysuperficial.  For  instance, he has  sent about 200 Afghan  youths to be educated inEurope.   Ho has started secondary schools under foreign professors, anil even a girls&apos;
.S school in Kabul.  He has connected Peshawar and Kandahar with Kabul by telegraph and a motor road.  He is building telephone lines, roads, and aerodromes all over die country.  Kabul now boasts a modern  water supply, and a fine hydro-electric plant. which provides power Tor the State factories as well as electric light to the city.   The roads, which used to be insecure, are now usually safe, and foreigners can travel  lon^r distances without any escort.   Like Mustapha Kemal,  King  Amanulla  is adopting modern customs, ami even  modern  dress.  He suffers, however, from lack of money and from too ambitious a  programme.  Tho irksome economies  and the enhanced&apos; taxation which he has  lately introduced, and  the social reforms, such as compulsory female educatiou, which he  is hastening, have made him unpopular, and he is exposed in no small degree to the familiar  hazards of an oriental ruler.    18.  One must  admit then  that under the  present  regime  there has  been a marked  change  iu  Afghan  outlook.   Up to 1919  the Afghans  most  deep-rooted political passion was to keep the foreigner out; now, of his own free will, he invites him within  the territory.  Up to 1919 his great dread was the introduction of Western diplomacy,  and his  only representative  abroad was  in India;  now he is represented in  seven  foreign capitals.   Up to  1919  he  shunned  Western invention ; now he assiduously exploits it.   In the old  days  the Afghan  Government repelled all suggestions to  extend  railways  into  their country;  the  present Amir  has only been restrained by the tact of Sir Francis Humphrys and the economy of our policy from proffering a direct request to us to do  so.  To this point we shall  revert later.   (See Part VII.)    19. The regular Afghan  Army  is not a  lighting machine in any proper modern use of the term.   It is  true that it possesses modern rifles,  machine-guns and  breech- loading artillery; but the attempt  which has been made to organise it on  a European model has so far succeeded  only in destroying a part of the fighting value which it might have  possessed had it remained on an irregular, or tribal, basis of organisation. Major Dodd, our Military Attache  at Kabul, told us  that the artiller\r is useless, and the machine-gun personnel untrained.   He described  the Afghan Army as a whole as being &quot; entirely incapable of withstanding a russian, or indeed any other, invasion.&quot; But  it is  to be borne in mind that the King holds au exaggerated opinion of its efficiency  and  potentialities  ; and  there is always the danger that,  if left to himself, his overweening self-conlideuce might tempt him to try conclusions with Russia.   20.  Reverting after this preface to the political  situation, it is necessary to draw particular attention  to the fundamental change which came over our Afghan relations in  1919.  LTp  to that time  the foreign affairs of Afghanistan were entirely under our  control; her boundaries with Russia were defined in British  treaties; and, on more than one  occasion, Imperial Russia had publicly declared that Afghanistan lav outside  her sphere of influence.  We,  for our part, paid the Amir  an annual subsidy in cash, and we \vere  bound  by solemn engagements to assist  him  in repelling unprovoked  aggression. In short, Afghanistan was  a protected  State  and wholly within our orbit.   In 1919 the Amir  Habibullah, who throughout the war had beeu staunch  to hisengagements,  was   assassinated.   Amanulla  seized the  throne  by  ousting   the recognised heir-apparent ; and,  within  four  months  of  his  accession,  delivered a wanton  and entirely unprovoked  attack on  India.   This  was  repelled without  real difficulty,  but the treaty of good  neighbourliness, which was concluded after protracted negotiations, ushered in an entirely new phase  in our relations  with Afghanistan. Her ruler is now wholly independent of xis.   No longer have we any control over his foreign  affairs;  no  longer do we  pay him a cash subsidy :  no  longer are we pledged to assist him to repel aggression.    21. Soviet Russia was not slow to take advantage of the opportunities which the events of 1919  presented to her.   All  the Czarist treaties including, of course, the Anglo-Russian  Agreement of 1907 had  been  ostentatiously torn up ; Afghanistan on her own  initiative had thrown off the British yoke ; the door which had so long been closed could now or so it seemed be prised open.  In 1921  the Russo-Afghan Treaty, with its million rouble subsidy ;  its gifts of aeroplanes aud munitions ;  and its promises of assistance of various  kinds, was  formally ratified.   Afghanistan was no longer in  our single orbit.  In point, of fact, Russian infiltration has been considerably greater than our own, for  in  this  matter she  has  had,  and  must always have, a decided  advantage  over us. Wo  cannot  afford to encourage our subjects to embark upon commercial enterprises in Afghanistan, or to take risks, such as Russia willingly accepts, with the personnel which we send into the country.
   22. To one  particular feature of the  existing  relations between  Russia  and afghanistan  we desire to draw special  attention,  namely, the Russification of theAfghan Air  Force.  The Government of India hold that one of the chief reasons forthis  startling departure from  Afghanistan^ traditional policy of keeping the controlof her armed forces  entirely in her own hands was prompted by our  bombing ofKabul in 1919, and by the Amir&apos;s anxiety to win security against a repetition of suchaction.0   With  this theory Sir Francis Humphrys  is not in  agreement.  He  has informed us that the King, when he first  thought of starting aviatiou, implored us toprovide British pilots and, in fact, to take the whole air service under our control, andthat  he has regularly renewed that request every six months.   His requests have been refused for reasons which can hardly be challenged, namely, the boorish ill-treatment which the Afghans afford to foreign employees ;  the impossibility of making an Afghanair force efficient; the contributions  to the cost which are now made by Russia andwhich could not be justified to tlie Indian Legislative Assembly ; and the impossibility of allowing our airmen to bomb Afghan tribesmen, since this would expose  them tomutilation if captured and embroil them in the civil  wars of the country.  Althoughthe Russian  airmen have accomplished some  good  performances, we are informedthat  they are badly treated by the Afghans, that they  are becoming  discontented, thatthe  Russians have failed to make  good their promises as regards the supply of machines, and that insufficient money is spent on  the force, which is  deterioratingif it is not actually disintegrating.  The force at present consists  of 13 aeroplanes, ofwhich 11  were  supplied  by the Soviet  and 2 from British sources.  There are atpresent only 2 in flying condition.  There is a total  of  18 Russian pilots  andmechanics, 7 having recently returned to Russia on completion of contract.  FreshRussian  personnel are expected.  There are also 3 Afghans with some  air training,but who do not fly.  Twentjr Afghans were sent to Moscow to be trained as pilots andmechanics;  of these, 12 were expected to complete  their training  as pilots  and 8 asmechanics by the end of  the summer 1027.  There  are also 7 Afghans training aspilots and 11 as mechanics in France.  As far as Air  Ministry information goes, noueof these  are  likely to be of much  value to the Afghan Air  Force.  A number of aerodromes and lauding grounds have been established in Afghanistan.   We suggest a means for countering this development in para. 53 (e).   23. But, notwithstanding all Russia&apos;s attempts at infiltration, Afghanistan has by no means fallen  under  her influence.   Sir  Denys Bray told us thatt  &quot; it  was questionable whether the verbal propaganda of the  Russians was  as much  in their favour as was generally imagined.  Tho Afghan appraised the Russian at  his truevery low value,  and the Russian name  did  not stand high  in Afghanistan.&quot;  Thesame witness also said thatt &quot;the Amir could not  afford definitely to enter either the Russian  or the British orbit,  lie  felt that  he was situated between &apos; the tipperand  the  nether millstone.&apos;   He professed himself as being well aware of the danger to which he was exposed  from  Russia, but he thought in the vanity of his heart thathe was capable of dealing with the danger.&quot;  In Sir Francis  Humphrys we  have anofficial of the highest quality for the  maintenance of British influeuce at Kabul.   24. The collapse of Czardoni has of  course effected a fundamental change in  thepolitical situation since the days of  Lord Morley&apos;s  Inquiry.  Iu the days of CzaristRussia we dealt with a normal and balanced diplomacy, and London and St. Petersburgwere the diplomatic battle-grounds on which the integrity of Afghanistan was foughtfor and, in  the event, secured.   In  those days Russia could not.  afford to  lose theadvantages of normal  relations with us or to face the dangers which would  arise onthe international chessboard from a rupture.   The situation to-day is of course whollydifferent.   25. It is not altogether easy to judge  how far the modern Russian army constitutesau efficient and modern lighting machine.  The Foreign  Office has  furnished us witha  Memorandum^ on Russian Fxpansiou into Asia,  which suggests that, judged bythe standpoint of recent history, the Russian character is iiicapable of so formidablean operation  as the crossing  of the Hindu Ktish, and we have received considerableevidence in support of this view.  We are told$  that  General  Hoffman, who wasGermany&apos;s military delegate at the Peace of Brest Litovsk, and who has since then made   * Sir Donys Bray&apos;s evidence, Minutes of 1st Mooting&apos;, page 5, and Government of India despatch no. 9 (enclosure to O.I.D.

a special study of conditions in Russia, summed up Ins views as regards the militarycapacity of the. Red generals in two sentences : -&quot; Whether Budyani, the &apos; Red Marat,&apos;as his admirers call him, is able to  lead even a single cavalry division  remains 10 beseen.  It also remains to be seen whether Red Russia possesses a single higher officercapable  of  leading an infantry division  in battle, to say nothing of  strategy on alarge scale.&quot;  As  regards  the state  of  the equipment and  the trustworthiness ofthe  bulk of the Soviet troops, General Hoffman is even more disparagingBotharmament  and equipment are in  part, at least, good.   That is to  say, as far as the60,000  picked men whom  we generally  refer to as  the Cheka are  concerned ....The rest of the troops of  the Red Army are, however, according to the information available, without exception,  extremely  ill-equipped  and armed.  To  make  mattersworse, the general trustworthiness of these troops is so doubtful that  in many casestheir weapons have  to  be taken  away  from  them  when  they are off duty. the instruction  of these men is conducted rather on political  than military lines.&quot;    Sir Robert Hodgson, on  the other  hand, lately His Mnjesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at moscow, told0 us that he thought General  IIoffman\s estimate was applicable to theRussian Army of 1922, but  not  to the army of to-day, and that there has been a distinct  improvement during the last five years, not only in the army but also in the airforce.  Sir  Robert&apos;s general conclusion was, that the army supported the Government,but  had no particular desire to  fight.   &quot;  In fact, it might be said  that  both  for political reasons and in a military sense,  it  was  strong for defence;  but for politicaland military reasons it was  not a good weapon for aggression.  It was still definitelybelow the standard of efficiency of the Czarist army, and, indeed, it was doubtful if itwould ever  attain that standard under  the existing regime.&quot;    With regard to the question of maintenance, Sir Robert Hodgson thought that itwould be unsafe to assume that Russia could  not despatch  considerable forces to herAfghan frontier, and  maintain them there.  Although their railway stock is largelyworn out,  there is,  apparently, plenty of  it, and it could be  patched up  to meet requirements; moreover, the permanent way is in fairly good order.    20. In  these circumstances we have, for the purposes  of  this enquiry, adopted amilitary assumption;  which probably  errs on  the side of prudence,  namely, that.Russia if and when she decides on aggressive action must be reckoned, at any ratenumerically, as a first-class military Power.  At the same  lime, Sir Robert,  Hodgsonhas told  us that, although the Soviet Government is obsessed by the fear of encirclement,it &quot; has  at  the present time  neither  the will nor the  capacity to  take  aggressive action.&quot;   We accept,  this view, and its implications that  the danger from that quartet-is not imminent; and we have therefore adopted the further assumption that we maycount on a time margin in which to complete our precautionary  measures and perfectour plans.   Nevertheless, matters  like army organisation, and  railway  construction,are nor.  processes capable of summary despatch ;  and it is therefore important thatour general policy on these  and other cognate questions should be determined withoutunnecessary delay.    27.  Whatever  may be  the capacity  of Russia for  actual  war, it  is of  coursenotorious that  the Soviet regime has developed the more insidious arts of propaganda to the highest degree of perfection.  By  these methods  a ring of Moslem States,conducted on Bolshevist lines and acknowledging the authority of the Russian Soviet,has  been created  on  the northern borders of  Afghanistan,  contiguous  with thoseAfghan provinces with whose population they  have close  racial affinities.  Sir FrancisHuinphrys told us that the Russians are making great efforts to popularise their rule inthe new Nationalist Republics of Turkmanistan,  Uzbegistan and  Tajikistan, and carryon ceaseless propaganda among  the Afghan tribes north of the Hindu Kush in thehope of  associating them more closely with their affinities in  the north. At preseut,however, although Afghan rule is very oppressive, the tribes prefer it to the  Russian.The King is alive to the clanger ami is taking steps to deal with it.  In Sir  FrancisHumphrys&apos; view, provided  that  the tribes in the north were  not  assisted by Redtroops, tLs King could, in a very fow  weeks, deal with any movement on their part.&quot; He would make a terrible  example of them.&quot;  Nevertheless, we have kept this new factor constantly before our eyes.    28.  Even the intervention of Japan would not prevent Russia from putting in thefield  the forces required  for  an advance through Afghanistan  to India.   We have therefore excluded Japan from our consideration.   But in this general  review of tho* D.I. 9th Minutes.
present situation we  feel bouiul to mention the termination of the Anglo-japanese alliance.   In this respect the weights have been changed to our disadvantage.    29. Finally, of  the new factors since the days of Lord Morley&apos;s Report, one of themost important, as affecting the problem under discussion, is the advent of air powerand the advance of mechanisation.  At this stage we merely invite attention in general terms to the potentialities of air and mechanised forces in a country like Afghanistan^aud to the advantages which accrue to us as a result of these developments.                        IV.-The Integrity of Afghanistan.    30. In the preceding  summary of the situation we  have observed  that our  treatyobligation to assist. Afghanistan in  repelling  Russian aggression  no longer exists.The policy of  earlier  years, however, rested on  expediency no less  than on  treatyobligation.   &quot; Plainly, no peace would be satisfactory,&quot; wrote Mr.  Balfour in 1903,&quot; which left  Russian outposts materially nearer our present frontier than  they are atpresent&quot;  (O.I.D.   Paper  No.  150-71).   Similarly,  Lord Morley&apos;s Sub-committee reported : &quot; We consider that alike  by definite treaty and by our own plain interest&quot;&apos;our  obligations to guard   ....   the integrity of  Afghanistan are unimpaired &quot;(Paper D.I. 2).  Mow far does  this obligation of interest  still remain ?  The  answerturns mainly on the  question of how far the integrity of Afghanistan is  essential tothe defence of India.    31. The  military appreciations  of both  the Chief of the  Imperial General Staffaud of the  General  Staff in  India  (which, as  we  shall  see  later, differ  in some important respects) are at  one in regard  to the importance  of a definitely friendlyAfghanistan.  This is a  primary condition  of their  strategical  plans.   Sir  AndrewSkeen told us that  if the  Afghans were unfriendly &quot; the tribes on  the frontier wouldbe  against  us to a man.&quot;  &quot;H  the  Afghans  were  hostile or  unfriendly,&apos;1  say theGeneral  Staff  in  India,  &quot;a  military situation  of  the  greatest gravity  would  be inevitable.&quot;  We should have to resign ourselves except perhaps in the south-west to the defence  of India on our own frontier,  a line which was condemned  in  strikinglanguage by Lord Napierj as far back as 1S7S, which has been  consistently rejected by all  pastj enquiries, ami which Sir Andrew Skeon aptly described  to us as the&quot;last, ditch.&quot;   We should  have to  employ larger forces to  keep the tribes on ourfrontier  in check  and to maintain  internal security  in  India  itself.  In fact a farhigher standard  of preparation, involving heavy expenditure in  time of peace, would lie essential both at Home and  in India.    32. The question now arises as to whether we can count on a friendly Afghanistanunless we are  prepared  to assist her  to the full extent of our power  to retaiu hernorthern provinces.  The Indian Governments view  on this point is as follows :              The loss of Herat and  of her  territory north of the Hindu  Rush woidd       deal Afghanistan  a grievous  blow and  set up a  serious situation for India.       But it  would  not  in itself  mean the loss of her elliciency as a buffer;  the       inhabitants  are non-Afghan in race and sentiment, aud in  some sense detract       from the cohesion  of the State.  Shorn of her northern provinces Afghanistan       would suffer heavy economic  loss.    But history has  shown that x\afghanistan       can exist as a   State without them.   For the  welding of  the various provinces       into one kingdom  is, after all, of comparatively recent  date, and the Afghan       portions, if  they survived  the  first  shock, might acquire greater cohesion  and       greater determination to resist  the  Russian advance, while  the main physical       barrier  between Russia and India would  remain uupierced.&quot;    Consequently the  Indian Government  would not  treat the  seizure  of  northernAfghanistan as a casus  belli.   They would  seek to  restore the situation  by indirect   * ftalic* tire not in  tho  original.   t Extract from a Memorandum by Lord Napier, dated 30/// May 1S7S (C.T.D. Paper No. 6-2)., p. 10) :    &quot;It has been asserted by people with protonsions to spank with authority that we shall bo secure if weremain within our mountain boundary, but this is at variance with history.

He points out  that the King,  like  his  predecessors,  is  careful  to  sen that a  due proportion of Afghan tribesmen is domiciled in the north, and that some of  the most influential men in the State possess lands in those parts, and that therefore the inhabitants of  the north can by no means be regarded  as wholly non-Afghan.   He emphasises  the importance of the northern provinces from the point of view of  food  supply and revenue, and he concludes:           &quot;It is safe to say that, if the income from the north wen; cut olf,  there would        be no money to pay the army and chaos would  result.          &quot;The  south-eastern provinces would then almost  inevitably break up  into       separate tribal communities, and there would be  no Central Government or        ruling Amir with whom relations could  be  satisfactorily maintained.   In my       view, what, remained of  Afghanistan woidd fail to function as -an  efficient        buffer. . . .&quot;0    In his verbal evidence as to the effect of a refusal on our part  to co-operate with Afghanistan in turning Russia out of the northern provinces, Sir Francis was even more emphatic :           &quot;If Russia were to take  a  full step towards India, and we were to decline       to turn  her out, we should  be regarded  by every Afghan as  traitors, and we       should be hated by the -Mohammedans  in India and also by  the Persians, who       foresee similar trouble for themselves.&quot;&quot;)&quot;            y             a             0             0              0         &quot;From  the political point  of view it would  be dangerous to fight defensively       on the line proposed (i.e. the  Hindu Kush llelmand  line)  since the  Afghans       would suspect  us  of designs to partition their country  with  Russia.  The       Afghans  were, already apprehensive on that  score, ami they would inevitably       regard  our attitude  towards  Russian  encroachments  as   the  test  of  our       intentions.&quot;    31. If Sir Francis Humphrys  is  right, it would follow that a refusal  on our part to co-operate with the Afghans in turning the Russians out of  the northern provinceswould result either in  their falling definitely under the rule oT Russia, or in a break-up of  the country.   In either  event all hope of a friendly Afghanistan would vanish.The primary condition of the military plans of the Chief of the Imperial General staff and of the  General Staff  in India would  remain  unfulfilled.  Both India  and theEmpire as  a whole would  be confronted  with  a military  situation of  the utmostgravity, either in peace or in war, involving heavy and constant expenditure.    35. In these  circumstances  we think that, irrespective of moral  obligations, thematerial consequences  of any  substantial  Russian  encroachment would  be  no lessdangerous to India and no less disastrous to our general interests at the present time than they were in the past.   But whether we describe  the  integrity  of Afghanistan as&quot;essential&quot; or  merely as  &quot;important,&quot; it is  evident that  we ought  not to  allow ourselves to drift into a  perilous  situation such as that described above, if by any means it  can be avoided.   It is true, as the Government of India  point out, that weare no longer able to protect Afghanistan  by the ordinary weapons of  internationaldiplomacy.   It is true that we are weakened, as compared with earlier years, by the alteration of our treaty relations  with  Afghanistan and  by the termination of theAnglo-Japanese Alliance.  In  the  last resort,  however, tho question  turns, as it hasalways turned,  on whether  we have the military power not to prevent a temporaryoccupation  by the Russians of the northern part of Afghanistan, which  is admittedlybeyond our capacity but, in co-operation with the Afghans, to turn them out as theresult  of  a more or less prolonged  war.   To  that problem we will  now direct our attention.                            V. The Military Aspect.    30.  On the military aspects of the problem the advice on which the Governmentof India have based their  opinion differs  somewhat  from that givon to  us by  the
* U.T. 3rd Minutes, page 10. Chief of the Imperial General Staff and  the Chief  of  the Air Staff.   Both the Indian and the Home Staffs advocate holding Kabul  with  the object of supporting the Afghans more especially by strong air forces-in resisting  tho occupation of the northern provinces, in holding the passes and  generally in delaying the advance of the enemy to the Hindu Kush.  Both advocate the immediate occupation of Kandahar. The General Staff in India would  then occupy a position  on the Helmand and allow the enemy to advance  through Herat and  Farah, with  a view  to  falling upon him when his communications are fully extended.  The  Chief of the Imperial  General Staff, while  recognising that events in  the southern theatre would develop  more slowly,  would adopt an offensive policy from the outset and would advance from the Iielmand  with mechanised  and air forces, supported  by the  maximum  laud forces that can be  maintained by the extension  of  the railway from Chaman, with a view to engaging  and  defeating the enemy at the  earliest possible moment, before  he can organise his advance and before Afghanistan has lost heart.  The latter  plan is designed  to  prepare, the way for driving the enemy out of Afghanistan, the  former for the  defence of  India  on  the Hindu  Kush-llelmand line, which covers only the southernmost provinces of Afghanistan.   37.  We do not wish to emphasise unduly this difference of  opinion, and we think it  is easily explained when the different points of view of the two Staffs are taken into consideration.  The General Staff in India, no doubt,  felt  difficulty  in assuming that Great Britain would be prepared to make an effort for the eviction of Russia from the remole and unknown area of Afghanistan commensurate with the requirements of the situation.   They were, of course, aware that the preparedness of the Indian Army, ou whom the first  brunt or the war would  fall, is at present based on the assumption that the maximum  external  danger to India is  from Afghanistan and the tribes.  They were  also doubtless influenced, if only  subconsciously, by the  knowledge that the economies resulting from the  Inchcape Committee of 1922  had seriously depleted their  resources, and by the difficulties they have encountered in securing the funds necessary  for further development    In these circumstances it is not very surprising that they should hold that we cannot expect in the most favourable circumstances of Afghan co-operation to recover by  direct military action  the  northern provinces  of Afghanistan.   3S. The  Chief of the  Imperial General Staff, on the other hand, basing himself on the assumption that the  Empire would  be prepared to  make the necessary effort, and that certain  essential antecedent measures  would be undertaken, is confident  that we could do so.   He had in mind also the intended reorganisation of the British Army in the direction of mechanisation, to which he had just given a great impetus; and  bothhe and the Chief of the Air Staff were no doubt influenced by the development which is taking place  in our capacity to reinforce  the air forces in India from  Iraq and Egypt.The terrain west of the  mountain  ranges in Afghanistan is, in fact,  peculiarly suited to  the employment of a mechanised force supported  by  air forces.   39. In view of this difference of  professional opinion, after hearing  the views ofthe Chief of the Imperial General Stall&apos;, the Chief of the Air Stall&apos;and of Lieut.-Geueral Sir Andrew Skeen, the Chief of the General Stall in India, we thought  it right to obtainthe opinion  of  independent military authorities.   Field--Marshal Lord  Haig, whosestudy of this problem dates from  18SS,  and who  was Inspector-General of Cavalry,and later,  Chief of  the General Staff in India under  Lord Kitchener, einphaticallysupported the views of the Chief of  the  Imperial General Staff.  &quot; I am confident,&quot;said  Lord  Haig, &quot; that, with reasonable preparations, we  can follow  up a declarationof  war by successful action.&quot;   And again, &quot;Given adequate preparation, we can lookwith confidence to inflicting decisive defeats in the Eastern theatres. History leadsus to believe that, in the face  of such local defeats,  Russia will make peace on almostany terms.&quot;   Field-Marshal Sir Claud  Jacob, a member of our Sub-Committee, whowas recently  Chief of the  General  Staff in India, and  who has a lifelong knowledgeof  this  problem, also expressed himself in full  accord  with the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.8-1   40. In  view of this preponderance!!of  high military opinion,  we have no hesitation in  endorsing tho views of tho Chief  of the Imperial-General Staff.    Wo  approve in principle  the plan  which he has drawn up  in  outline ;  and wo  are  particularly impressed by the illuminating  conception of the execution  of the operations  on the
left wing by mechanised  forces,  of an  entirely novel character.  The Chief of theImperial General Staff has made it plain that his plan is as yet by no means concrete,and that considerable experiment and  research is required before the principles whichhe advocates can be  put into effective practice.  In  view of  our assumption (in para. 20) that  the danger  of Russian  aggression need  not be regarded as imminent.we think we may count on the necessary time margin.    41. Having thus satisfied ourselves that tho northern frontier of Afghanistan can be recovered by  direct military action, provided the Empire is prepared to make thenecessary effort, we recommend, mutatis mutandis, the reaflirmation of tho recominendu-tion of Lord Morley&apos;s Sub-Committee, that &quot; by our own plain  interest our obligations to guard the independence and integrity of Afghanistan are unimpaired, and that the deliberate crossing of the Ox us  or the occupation of Herat by Russia would he theviolation of a frontier which we are bound to defend.&quot;   We also follow Lord Morley&apos;s Sub-Committee  in assuming  that in  the  last resort  &quot; Russian action  of  tho kindindicated would  ho followed  by a declaration  of war against that Rower.&quot;    -12. It  is impossible to define precisely  the kind of  Russian action  that would justify so extreme a measure, more especially  now that we have, no treaty engageiiieniseither with Russia or Afghanistan.  Each caso will have to be decided on  its merits.Sir Francis Ilumphrys has made some  valuable suggestions0 on  the subject, whichwe think might provide a valuable guide as  to the attitude we should adopt in varyingcircumstances.                VI. The  Implications of the Policy recommended.    43.  Having defined the policy which we recommend which  is, broadly speaking,similar to that adopted by the  Committee  of  Imperial Defence in 1907 it remains toexamine the implications of that policy both in the  military and political spheres.   44.  In tho  military sphere we have invited the  Chief  of the Imperial GeneralStaff, in  consultation  with the  Chief  of  tho  Air Staff, to elaborate  his  plan in fulldetail, beginning from the  first day of mobilisation, and showing what  is contemplatedat each stage during the first year, on  the assumption that a violation of the frontier of Afghanistan, of such a nature as to constitute a  casus belli, has in fact taken place.We have instructed  the Chief  of the Imperial General  Staff to base his plan on theassumption  that  conscription would not be  enforced during tho first year of a war,but that up to 250,000 men of  good quality would  be obtained by voluntary methodsin the first three mouths  alter the outbreak of war.   We  are aware of the immenseadvantages  of some  form  of  compulsory service,  both  from a  military  ami  an administrative point of view, but we are convinced  that it would be impossible, in  theearly days of a war in so remote a theatre as Afghanistan, to bring home to the nationthe vital nature  of the  conflict.   We think  it safe  to  assume, however, that  therewould he sufficient enthusiasm to produce  by voluntary menus the number mentionedabove.   45. We have  also invited  the Chiefs of  Stall&apos;  Sub-Conunittee to examine what.means exist of exerting pressure on Russia elsewhere than in Afghanistan.  They arenow engaged on an  intensive  study of this  question ;  but from an Interim Reporttwith which they have furnished us, it is  clear that none of  the operations which canbe undertaken in other parts  of the world  are likely to  be productive of decisive oreven of very  important results.    In this connection the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade is examiningnot only the extent to which economic  pressure  could  be applied to Russia, but alsothe  economic  consequences  to  tho British  Empire of a  war  with Russia.  this examination will  largely determine the general plan of naval operations.  In additionenquiries have been  instituted as to  the areas in which Soviet Russia  is likely toendeavour to thwart us by propaganda, tho form their activities are likely to take, andthe methods  which might bo  adopted to counter these activities.    40. in the course of our Inquiry it  has come to our  knowledge that neither theArmy nor the Royal Air Force in  India  are at present capable of fulfilling the roleassigned to  it  in the strategical plans of the Chief of the Imperial General  Staff.That role is as follows :      1. On the Northern Line      ((.)

(b)  Later, to develop the bulk of the Field Army of India in the Kabul area, for         use as circumstances may dictate.   II. On the Southern Line       To  secure  the  line  of the  Ifelmand and  cover the  Kandahar  Province,         developing communications  to permit of an advance towards Herat on the         arrival of reinforcements  from overseas.   I IT.  To maintain order in India and in the frontier areas.    17. Lieut.-Gen.  Sir Andrew Skeen has furnished us with a Memorandum^ setting forth his personal views as to the  measures required to enable the Army in India  tocarry  out these duties, covering  such  matters as shortage  of British and Indianpersonnel,  signals,  transport, remounts,  equipment of  all  kinds, Air  units. TankCorps,  etc.   We understand that these deficiencies  are in larije measure due  to reductions effected on  the recommendations of  Lord lnchcape&apos;s Committee : and we desire to draw  attention  to  the fact that this retrenchment scheme contained animportant stipulation to the effect that the military position  should be  reconsideredwhen  the financial situation of  India  had improved.  Lord Beading told us that thelate Lord Rawlinson regarded the reductions  with considerable misgivings, and  thathe was most insistent on the- inclusion of the stipulation  we have quoted.  Moreover,it. was only on that express condition that the Cabinet agreed to the scheme.   -IS. This brings  us  to the whole question of the incidence of the cost of  bringing the Army and Royal Air Force in  India up to tho required standard of preparedness;and we have been impressed by the fact that, notwithstanding the  economies recentlyeffected, the net military  expenditure of  India is still no less than five-sixteenths of the total revenue.   On  this subject Sir Basil Blackett made  an intcrestingf statement,  lie told  us that *&apos; from the political  and economic  point of  view there  was a crying  need forincreased expenditure on Cation-building&apos; services, and that  the  expenditure  of55  crores  on  the  non-productive service  of defence  was  regarded  both by theGovernments  in India  and the  Indian  people  with  suspicion and  envy; that thepossibilities oT increased central taxation, for any purpose whatsoever, was at presentvery small, and, for  military  purposes, non-existent,&quot;  and that, therefore, it  was&quot; difficult to conceive an increase of the military budget,&quot; even so far as to compensate for the  reductions effected on the recommendations of the Inchcape Committee ;  andthat India &quot; had no easily available war reserve.&quot;   Sir Basil summed  up by saying that &quot; although there were admittedly deficiencies in Indians  military preparation,  it  was  impracticable  for  financial, political  andeconomic reasons to  remedy these deficiencies  rapidly in  the  immediate future.&quot;Sir Basil Blackett also informed us that  the Indian Government is  considering a  plan for the  stabilisation of  the military budget for a period of years, in the hope that theArmy in India  will itself effect savings, which  it will  be permitted to  expend  onremedying some of  the present defects in military organisation and equipment.   Butwe did  not gather the  impression that very substantial  sums would accrue from this source.    49.  The Government  of India has in  the  past arguedj that the cost of defensive preparations outside  of  those required  for what are  admittedly  the  functions  ofIndian  defence, such as war with  Afghanistan and the tribes and the maintenance ofinternal order,  should  be an  Imperial  charge.   The Home Government has neveradmitted this contention, but it has never in terms rejected it.  The  wider questionwhether India pays too much  or  too little  of the cost of Empire defence generallylies outside our terms of reference, and we express no opinion on  it.   But, subject  toany decision that may later be taken on it, we are of opinion that IndiVs  rcsponsi-bility for  preparing  in time of peace for the problems of defence which we are considering will be discharged if  her forces and their equipment arc brought tip to a scale adequate for war with Afghanistan and the tribes of the North-West  Frontier,or to enable India to co-operate with the  Imperial Forces, in accordance with tho rdlegassigned to her by agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governmentof  India in the greater contingency of  war with Russia  in defence of India.  In thisconnection  it is observed that the Army  in  India is short, of some 2,500 British
officers aud some 15,000  men  to  meet her war requirements for  even this limited liability.   This deficiency can  only be made good  by the British Army in England.In  regard  to the  Royal  Air Force  in  India, when  the two additional  squadronsrecently authorised have arrived  no reserve aircraft to replace  even normal  peacewastage will be available for them  in India.    We earnestly commend the  whole question of the preparedness of  the  Army and royal  Air Force in  India to meet the realities  of the situation for the serious consideration of the Government of India; and we hope  to return to this question ina later  report.    50.  We turn now  to the implications of our  proposed  policy in the politicalsphere.   Wo have already emphasised the paramount importance  of Afghan goodwillaud co-operation; and it is reassuring to learn0 that &quot; there has been of late a steadvimprovement  in the attitude of the Afghan Government  towards  our  frontier tribes,and in  its appreciation of the responsibilities and duties of neighbourly conduct.&quot;    Nevertheless, there  is  one disquieting  feature in  our  present  relations withAfghanistan.  She  has everything to hope for from us and nothing to  fear.   FromRussia  she has everything  to fear and nothing to hope for.  And  3&apos;et, to some extent,she  tends  to lean towards Russia  and  to  hold  aloof from us.  The position isuncomfortable,  dangerous  and  paradoxical ;  and  wo should  make  every elfort  loremedy it.   51.  Sir Francis  llumphrys has informed us that  the King and his Ministers haveconstantly hinted that  the &quot; Neighbourly  Treaty &quot; should be  replaced by  a &quot;Treatyof Friendship&quot; that  is,  by an instrument  which would  confer greater materialadvantages on  Afghanistan in  return  for a  vague  expression of goodwill towardsEngland.   But he points out that the chief objection to such a treaty is the existenceof a similar agreement  between Russia  and Afghanistan and the probability that negotiations would develop into  an  Anglo-Russian auction.   He considers, however and we  agree that the  time  has now  come when we should do  something to  markour  appreciation of the King&apos;s recent  friendly behaviour  and to  emphasise  thecommunity of the&apos;  interests of Afghanistan  and the British Empire  in the face  ofRussia.   52.  In  the first  place, he suggested that King Anianullah would greatly prize  a personal gift from His Majesty the King, and also that it might be diplomatic to awarda high British Order lo him.  In pursuance of the former suggestion a pair of sportingrifles had been  purchased, with His Majesty&apos;s approval,  with a view to their  beingpresented  to the Amir by  Sir F. Humphrys on his return to Kabul, after which HisMajesty had agreed also to consider further the question  of  a British Order.   Theposition has, however,  since  been entirely  altered, so  far as the question of thedevelopment of friendly relations  with the Amir  personally is  concerned, by theannouncement of his forthcoming visit to Europe.   The proposed gift  of rifles fromthe King is being held in suspense, and the question of personal  relations with KingAmanullah will  naturally resolve itself into one of tho treatment he receives when hevisits tins country.  We understand that ho has accepted with every  sign of appreciationthe invitation of His Majesty the King to visit him in London, and also offers made tohim by the Government of India to entertain him officially in  India and to providepassages  from India to Egypt.   It appears not at  all impossible that  he  may seek to make his visit to  England the  occasion  of discussing also the question of  thedevelopment of friendly  relations with Afghanistan generally.    53.  In this  connection, Sir Francis Humphrys   had  suggested to  us  that ourrelations with Afghanistan  might be materially improved, and our position substantiallystrengthened, if we were to assist  the King more actively in the development of  his country.   The directions in which this might be done are briefly these:      (a) Definite acceptance of the  principle of assistance  in the development of road         and telegraphic communications with India.     (b) Assistance, both expert and  financial, in tho construction of any railways in          south-eastern Afghanistan which are held to bo beneficial to British as well          as to Afghan interests.  We elaborate this  proposal in Part VII.     (c) Assistance in  establishing exchange banks in  Afghanistan.   There are at          present no such  banks, although  the  Russians have recently mado  great        *  Ciovonunont of India Despatch No.  para. 2 (Aimexuro A to O.X.D. Paper No. 149-B).
        efforts to institute them as bases of propaganda.   We are given to understand        that  reputable  English banks might be  ready to establish  branches in        Afghanistan,  without any  direct  financial assistance  from  Government,        provided  they were given  a contingent guarantee of compensation for  loss        in  the event  of their premises or specie  being raided.  The Amir would        have to be manoeuvred into tho position of asking for our assistance in  this        matter.  It would be a great mistake for us to make the first move.    (d) Assistance in reorganising the Customs and Posts and Telegraph Departments.        These  are  in a  deplorable  state  of inefficiency.   Their  reorganisation        would  produce  a largo increase in the annual  revenue of  the  country  and        tints strengthen  the Central Government.   It is inadvisable that we should        ourselves undertake  this   reorganisation,  since  we should  inevitably  be        accused of manoeuvring the Customs to our advantage ;  and we have arranged        that Sir Francis Ihunphrys  should  consult  with the Foreign Oflice as to the        country which might be suggested  to the King as the most suitable agents.        Here again  the request should come from him.    (e) The establishment and maintenance of a civil air service between Kabul  and        Peshawar, conducted by British pilots  and subsidised by  the  Government        of India.  This  would, we  think, have the great advantage of ousting the        Russo-Afghan Air Force (see  para. 22 mite), and  would give British pilots        experience  of regular flying over Afghan  territory.  There is, however,  this        practical difficulty, that the  Legislative Assembly might not be willing to vote        the necessary funds for a  flying  service of this kind.   We attach great        importance to the proposal and trust that it will bo possible to overcome        this difficulty.  Here again, however, the  initiative must come from King        Amanullah  himself.   The Secretary  of State  for India  has communicated our views  on  the  above proposals to the Viceroy.   54. Finally, there is the  question of British  representation in Afghanistan.   Atpresent, our Consulates  at  Kandahar and Jelalabad are in charge of Indians, whohave, we are told, proved  entirely unfitted to represent British  interests or to upholdBritish prestige.  Moreover, their employment is  keenly resented  by the Afghans.We consider that substantial  advantages, both  in  the  political  sphere  and in thematter of Military Intelligence,  would  accrue from the substitution of Englishmenfor Indians at these Consulates.   Further, we  have, at  present, no Consulates at Herat and  Mazar-i-Sharif.  As aresult, there  is a gap of 1,500 miles  between Kashgar and Meshed in which there  isno Intelligence organisation ;  and   it  is impossible to get reliable information ofRussian activities in  northern Afghanistan.   Accordingly,  we consider  that steps should be taken to establish Consulates, with Englishmen in charge, at both these places.  It has been suggested to us that this would inevitably result in the Russiansdemanding Consulates at Kandahar  and Jelalabad.   In our opinion  this contingencymay be regarded without  anxiety, more especially if effect  is given to the suggestionthat Englishmen should replace Indians as Consuls at the places in question.   The Secretary of  State  for  India has  communicated  our views on the  abovepropositions to the Viceroy.   55 The moral  effect of the above measures would be increased,  and the value ofthe material assistance which we hope  to receive  from Afghanistan in  the day ofemergency would he enhanced, if steps  were taken to strengthen the Afghan Army.hi view of  the events of 1919, there  is,  admittedly,  some  risk  in  this;  but,  ifAfghanistan is  to be  our  ally in war,  and if her assistance  is to be effective,  wemust cease to treat her as a potential  enemy in peace.   Moreover, the strengthening of the army would enable the King  to deal  more  adequately with tribal risings, andtend  to stabilise internal  conditions in Afghanistan ;  and  it  is  axiomatic  that thepreservation of the authority of the  Central Government is  in our best interests.  SirFrancis Humphrys has suggested0 that a gift of pack artillery up to six batteries might be considered ; other useful gifts would  be machine  guns, armoured oars,motor lorries and tanks.   He thinks  that gifts of military material would probably befollowed by tho appointment of an Afghan Military Attache in London, and that  this,combined with  the periodical visits of  Afghan  officers to manoeuvres in India andwith  the  attachment of  Afghans to British units  or  courses of instruction,  would tend  to promote liaison.                                *  1&apos;ujior No. D.l. 20.      2:!5:s                       &apos;                                          C
    &quot;)(;. We  agree generally  with  the  above  suggestions,  but we  think that  anyartillery supplied to Afghanistan should be of au obsolete pattern,   lu any case thewhole question will  require the closest consultation with the authorities in  India, andthe Secretary of State For India has communicated our views to the Viceroy.    57. As avcorollary to the policy of strengthening  the Afghan  Army in  peace it, is perhaps desirable that the  measures whereby it  can  be further strengthened in war should be predetermined.   Hut  until the  plan  has  been  elaborated  in  detail, it  isimpossible  to  make  any  specific recommendations.    At this stage, therefore,  weconfine ourselves to suggesting that, on the outbreak  of a Russo-Afghan war in which-Great Britain might be called  on to participate, a strong  Military Mission, equipped with aircraft, should be despatched to Kabul at. the earliest possible moment.                            VII.  -Railways in Afghanistan.    58. Finally  we  come to  the difficult question of railways.   The Chiefs of Stallin  both  their  preliminary reports on  tho  military  aspects of the  problem  underconsideration, strongly  recommended the  construction  of  railways  from  Ohaman  toKandahar and from Landi  Khana to Kabul.    58. The project  of the extension  of the Indian  railway system into Afghanistanis,  of  course, no new one.  As far back as LSOl  it  was warmly advocated  by LordRoberts ;c&apos; and it has since been  a  frequent subject of controversy.  But whatever thearguments and  counterarguments that have  been sustained  from  time  to  time  inSimla and London, the attitude of Kabul towards railways  has been unequivocal, and,until  recently, consistent.   Bast Amirs would  have none oT those things   Now,however, we are told that the position has diametrically changed ; and that  Amanullahis as determined  to have  railways as his predecessors were to exclude them,   lie hasfrequently told Sir Francis  Humphrys that  it is only by such a policy that Afghanistanwill be considered by Europe  to have emerged  from barbarism and  lie &quot; recognised as  an Fasteru Rower&quot;;  and, on  various occasions, he has only  with difficulty beendeflected  from profferinga direct  request to us  for assistance.   In these circumstances,the question of railway extension into Afghanistan can no longer be treated as it has so  often  been in the past.  Our  policy must be  pro-determined,  and our Ministerforewarned ;  the more  so, since  our  enquiries  have  disclosed a divergence  ofauthoritative opinion.    00. The Government  of India consider  that, from the  technical, commercial andeconomic  aspects, there  are  strong  arguments  in favour  of railway extension intoAfghanistan; while, with regard  to the political aspect,  of  the proposition, they holdstriking language:           &quot; Ami the political advantages are great indeed that  would  accrue to India       with  railways running  freely  between  Kandahar and  Quetta, Jalalabad and       Peshawar, fostering  civilisation in Afghanistan, as perhaps nothing  else could,       linking the two countries together by ever-strengthening ties of commerce aud       intercourse,  and   affording  the  tribesmen  on  both  sides  of the  frontier  a       continuous demonstration that Afghanistan and India  wore at  last acting in       unison.&quot;  &apos;  Extract from a .Yo/c, dated 267A August 1891,  by Sir  Frederick Roberts, Commander-in-Chief in India,    on tlu- insufficiency of the. garrison &quot;j India In meet our actual and prospective Military requirements in the    event of a conflict with linnxia.  (Enclosure to C.T.D. Paper A&apos;o.  7 D.)  211. There is one method open to  us which would improve our strategical  position, and somewhat.reduce ear demand  on the Home Government for British soldiers; and that is the extension of ourrailway system to the principal  points  we should admittedly bo  obliged to occupy in the event.of war.Tho construction of  trans frontier railways would, 1 lirmly believe, produce political aud military results,tho  value ami importance of which can scarcely he exaggerated,  lu the first place, the Afghans and thetribos  on our North-Wost Frontier would clearly perceive that  we were determined  to maintain oursupremacy throughout tho territory traversed  by those railways, and to  prevent the annexation of theircountry by  Russia.  They would  gradually bo brought into contact with us, and would he subject to ourcivilising influence;   By  being provided with a fair  recompense  for  their labour and a lucrative outlet for their agricultural produce, they would  have inducements to  abandon their predatory habits, whichare due in  a great  measure to their poverty.  In short, the best,  if  not the  only means of bringingAfghanistan  under  our control without undermining its   independence is  to  establish  railway communications between it aud India.  In the second place, it would bo  superfluous for me to enlarge ontho  advantage we should gain in a military sense by  being able at. once  to occupy tho Kabul-Kandaharalignment by means of railways instead of roads. The  force holding our linos of communication mightbe reduced by at least two-thirds,  commissariat, and transport  dilliculties would bo lessened  and thomobility anil consequently the ellicicncy of our Held army would be materially increased.           *          ******
   Ul. On the other hand, they consider that there  are  grave disadvantages.   Theydraw attention to &quot; the internal difficulties which  the  King might have to overcomebefore he could get so startling au innovation safely and  firmly launched &quot;  in the face of the unpopularity of his passion for reform, &quot; and the consequent restiveuess of anaturally disunited, undisciplined, and conservative  people.&quot;   They fear  that  itwould almost certainly  have the effect of  stimulating Russia  &quot; to force the pacegenerally in  Afghanistan.&quot;   They point  out that a loan  to  Afghanistan would benecessary; that  this  loan  would presumably have to  be granted  by the  indian government; and that it would  almost certainly never be directly liquidated.   Itwould in fact from a purely financial  point of view  be unproductive expenditure.Not only that, but the  grant of so material a subvention would have a &quot;prejudicialeffect on  the Afghan Government and  on the trend of our Afghan relations generally.&quot;   Finally -and  most important of all they enumerate the  strategical dangers, usestimated by  the Indian General Staff, in the  following terms :    &quot; 1. As regards war with Afghanistan  alone, though railway extension in  pence         towards our objectives, especially in the direction of  Kabul, wotdd bo all  to         our advantage,  it  would  not  be  essential to the  success  of  our  plans.         Moreover, by speeding  up construction  in war  the advance of railhead         should  be  sufficiently rapid to  bo of value to us  in  the  event of  more         extended  operations  being  forced  upou  us  than  those  we at  present         contemplate.  &quot; 11. As regards war with  Russia in Afghanistan  :    &quot; (a)  We should have no prospect of  eventual success without railways supporting         our  armies;  but   without  similar aid  the Russians  could not  develop         important forces either.   &quot;(It)  Even if we leave it  to Russia  to initiate railway extension into Afghanistan,         geographical conditions give us a time margin which should be sufficient  to         enable  us to forestall Russia  in  strength at the  points strategically most         favourable to us, viz., in the  Kabul area and on the lino of the Helmand.   &quot;(c)  We can therefore  view a Russian start without  panic, provided we can count         on being able to begin counter construction without delay. &quot;III. Extension  of railways either from Russia towards Herat or from India towards         Kandahar must eventually create  a  demand for their continuation through         Afghanistan.   Any move, Russian  or Indian, carries with it, therefore, tho         risk of starting a railway race and of bringing Russia and India face to face,         whether  in Afghanistan or  on the Indian frontier.   This  contact may be         inevitable,  but  we should  do nothing  to  hasten it.   It would  mean the         maintenance of a larger army  in India, increase the  chances of conflict, ami         set up a state of constant insecurity on the frontier. &quot;IV. Hence, however attractive the initiation of railway extensions from  India may         be from  the  point of  view  of war with Afghanistan alone, its advantages         cannot  be weighed  against  the great disadvantages  of  the  wider and more         remote consequences.&quot;   92. In  these  circumstances  the  Government  of India  consider that  &quot;all otherargiunents, strong though they are, and but for strategical  reasons  almost  conclusivein their  combined effect, must give  way  before  the paramount necessity of  doing-nothing  which might  prejudice the  defence of India ;  &quot; and they summarise their conclusions in tho following terms :          &quot;There  would be much danger in precipitate action, whether on our part or      the king&apos;s.  It would in any case  be unwise for us to make  the first  move,      even to the extent of  encouraging the  King to broach the subject.   Should he      do so of  his own initiative,  we  recommend  that the Minister   should be       instructed to adopt a sympathetic but  unenthusiastic  attitude;  that  he  should      expound with full candour the  likelihood of  any  railway extensions  from      India leading to pressure, in  the end probably  hardly resistible, for railway      extensions from Russia ;  the dangers that would flow to Afghanistan in times      of war from  either extension, north  or south ; and the certainty, as wo  see it,      that a railway extension  in  the north  would facilitate any aggressive designs      that Russia might, harbour, and so  tend  to impair the  security  of India&apos;s      north-west  frontier.   Should   the  King, despite a  clear  exposition of  the      strategical considerations, still  press for our aid  in furthering his schemes, it      would,  we  feel, be dangerous  for  us to turn him  the  cold shoulder;  to do     2853                                                                D
      so might drive him the  more  into  Ilussia&apos;s arms and  precipitate  railway      construction  in the  north.   But even  in  this case we should still  counsel      caution.   The  Minister, we think, should explain that until  the ground had      been  thoroughly surveyed, it would  be premature for the  King to attempt to      consider  in  detail any particular schemes at all, and  should  offer him  the      services  of  our expert staff to undertake  the  necessary  surveys.  And  the      Miuister should seek to draw the King&apos;s ideas away from an extension  towards      Kandahar and on to an extension from the Khyber towards Kabul, discouraging      him from  contemplating  anything  more  in the first instance  than  a short      extension to Dakka,  which would give the Khyber Railway a much needed      terminus, Afghanistan  a  short, lino of its  own  linking up  directly with  our      system on the  direct road  to  Kabul, and the King  experience of the  attitude      of his people to the introduction of railways, without the dangers that might      be. involved in  an extension of appreciable length.&quot;   Go. Sir Francis ilumphrys&apos; evidence,  however,  tends  to  diminish some of  theobjections urged by the Government of India.   He considers that it, would be unwise to lay too much stress on the internal difficulties which King Amahullah would haveto face, since &quot;conditions in Afghanistan are very different from what they were  liveyears ago.   Progress  on  modern  lines is the order of the day and has been acceptedby Afghans generally ....   The improvement of communications and the provisionof facilities for cheap transit are reforms which are now almost universally considered to be overdue, and  if the Afghan Government can  produce a railway scheme whichcarries with it no threat of increased taxation, there is little doubt that it would obtainmuch popular support.&quot;   With regard  to  the contention that  railway activity on  our part wotdd stimulateRussia to &quot; force the pace generally &quot; in Afghanistan, he enumerates the multifariousRussian activities  which are already  in  progress, and  points out  that our onlycontributions in reply tt) these activities have  been the construction of the Torkam-Kabul telegraph line and  the  survey of  the Khybcr-Kubul road.   lie  thereforeconcludes  that:         &quot;If there is  anything in the theory that Afghanistan aims at maintaining an      even balance  between  England and  Russia, there  is room for much British      activity in the  south-east before the scales could be said to be unduly weighted      in favour of  England.&quot;   While  agreeing  that, a loan to Afghanistan  for the purpose of railway constructionwould stand small  chance of being directly repaid, ho thinks there are good  grounds for hoping  that the  outlay would not be wholly unproductive.   Moreover, he  haslearned informally  that  the Indian  Railway Board would  probably be prepared to finance  the project  as  a speculation, in tho  hopes  of  increased  traffic  receipts.Finally, while  protesting that it is  not within his competence to discuss  strategicalconsiderations, he claims that it would &quot; be  a fallacy to  assume  that geographicaleonditions  presented us with a time margin, or that, should  Russia  be  first in theiield, we should count on a zero hour from which to commence  our own  building programme with the consent of the Afghan Government.&quot;    G4. Sir  Francis  Humphrys&apos; appreciation  of  the situation, and  the  conclusions which he  has reached, are given in his own language :          &quot; .   .  .   .  If I am correct in my estimate of King Amainilla&apos;s contemplated       railway programme, the stages which he has in mind are:            I.  Ohamnn to Kandahar.          II. Kandahar to Kabul via Ghazni.         III.  Kushk  to Herat.         IV.  Herat to Kandahar, to be carried out from both ends.       Should  he  follow tip  the hints which he and  his Ministers have  so often       given  me and make a direct request for the  construction of stage  I under       British auspices, and should I attempt to deflect him from his purpose, the       almost certain consequence would be  that  he  would  turn  to  Russia for the       construction of stage III  first.  And  then, if we came running to tho Afghan       Government for permission to build solely in our own  interests what we had       hitherto refused to build at their invitation, it would be clear that our motives       wore purely selfish and we should be faced with tho alternative of having ^to       accept tho  most  exorbitant  terms -e.g. to pay cash down without  conditions,
       or  d  constructing the  railway by force.  At  best  the  negotiations would be       protracted, for we should have been  manoeuvred into the position of bidders       aud we should lose the time margin on which we had counted.   The contrary       might well apply if we were first in the field  aud Russia, stimulated by our       activity, were  to apply  for a concession in the north.  The valuable  cards       would  then  be in our  hands, and we could  probably make  the building       programme which the King desired contingent on his refusal of  the  Russian       request.  The  Russians would  be told   that Afghanistan did  not  grant       concessions and  that  the  Kushk-Herat section was not for the moment  in       the programme.         &quot;My conclusion  may  be  briefly stated as follows.   Railways in Afghanistan       are bound to come sooner or later, especially on the Kandahar  side, anil the       Power  which initiates them  in  response to the Afghan Governments request       will be  presented with a tactical advantage of the first importance.  On the       other hand, a refusal will be taken  by  the King to indicate  that the progress       of Afghanistan is being deliberately discouraged, and he will turn to the  rival       Power for assistance.   A zero hour can then only bo achieved by force, and an       Anglo-Afghan  war on such an  issue  would  be a calamity which  should be       avoided at all costs.&quot;    Lord llaig, in his evidence,  laid the greatest emphasis on the strategic importanceof railway construction  in  Afghanistan.   lit  fact, he told  us that he regarded thedevelopment of adequate  communications both in, and beyond, India as the &quot; base ofthe whole structure &quot;  of  any plan  of  campaign.  lie advocated the construction of railways from Landi Khana to Jalalabad ; Chaman to Kandahar ; Jalalabad to Kabul;and, possibly,  Kabul to  Kandahar;  and,  in addition,  he recommended that thepossibilities of  the construction  of a railway to link  up  Sistan  with Karachi, or alternatively, with Gwattar (or Pasni), should be thoroughly explored.    G5. Lord Reading told us that he was impressed with the advisability of helping the  Amir to  build  railways,   lie pointed  out that  Russia already  had  manyadvantages over us in Afghanistan.  She  had built telegraph lines; she  had controlof the Air Force; she  had a relatively large number of personnel in  Afghanistan;she was prepared to do what we would scruple to do; she  coidd run risks which wewere not  prepared to accept.   For some time  past our  policy had  been directed towards   the  improvement  of  communications  on  the  north-west frontier;  and,therefore, railway construction was the one  direction in  which we could help the amir without  incurring the charge that  we were contemplating military operations or rendering military assistance to Afghanistan.  Lord Reading concluded by sayingthat if he  were still in India, he would  be  prepared to make monetary sacrifices for thepurpose  of pleasing  the  King ;  and that he would  certainly do so if  he saw ahydanger of Russia stepping in with a railway from Herat towards Kandahar.    (5G. There  is another point worth  noticing  in connection with Lord  Reading&apos;conclusions, namely, the difference of gauge  between  Russian and  Indian railways.The Russian gauge is 5 feet; the Indian 5 feet 6 inches.  The paramount importance on strategical, political and commercial grounds of ensuring that the Indian, not theRussian, gauge is  adopted as the standard gauge in Afghanistan  is obvious.  SirFrancis Humphrys thinks that the King would  probably desire  his  own gauge,different from  either the Russian  or  the  Indian; but he hopes  that, despite the amir*s inherent objection to dictation, this difficulty might be satisfactorily solved.  Itmight  be represented  to  him,  for instance, that  the  adoption of tho  Indian gaugewould enable us to lend him rolling stock, and would also obviate, at any rate at thebeginning, the necessity for tho construction of special workshops in Afghanistan.   67. Turning now to what programme of railway construction  would best serve out-interests, it goes without saying that we should do all in our power to influence theKing not  to allow railway construction in tho north, or at  any rate to postpone it  aslong as possible.  In this matter geographical  and economic conditions arc in our favour, since  it  is ou India  that Kabul  essentially depends for her communicationwith the outer world.   ,   68. Of the two possiblo routes the  Landikliana-Kabul extension is complicated as the  King  is well  aware by  tho constructional difficulties presented  by theJelalabad-Kabul section.   So groat indeed are  those that a direct alignment is scarcelypracticable; and it would probably bo  necessary for the lino to follow  tho  Panjshir
River to Charikar, and thence back to Kabul a  circuitous and difficult  route.  Wehave indeed been  informed that the Indian  Railway Hoard would probably find themoney for the extension from Landikhana as far as Jelalabad; and, further, that the amir would introduce legislation forbidding freight camels to go  beyond the Afghanterminus,  in order that his railway might, pay ; but even then  it seems very doubtfulwhether this  extension would be  attractive to tho Amir as the  first stage of hisrailway programme.  Tho extension  from  Ohaman to Kandahar,  on  the  other hand,presents no constructional difficulties ; and the further extension of this line to  Kabulvia Ghazni would  be equally simple.  A railway along this  alignment should make a,strong appeal to the  King, since it would  enable Afghan goods to be exported fromKabul to  the port of Karachi by the most direct  route, and. for a great  part of the journey, over Afghan lines.    In fact, commercial and technical considerations indicate that  the extension fromChaman to Kandahar should  be the lirst stage in Afghanistan&apos;s railway programme,and the linking up or Kandahar with Kabul the second.   This conclusion coincideswith Sir Francis Humphrys&apos; estimate of the Kings personal wishes in the  matter.    0&apos;.).  With regard to strategical considerations,  which must  of course he, from our point of view, the dominating factor, the Government of India hold that the northernextension  is  the less objectionable of the two.   They therefore recommend that theKing should  be influenced towards  this extension,  and that he should bo discouragedfrom  contemplating anything more  in the first  instance  than  a  short extension toDakka.   With this recommendation we do not entirely  agree, but it is to  be borne inmind that we are viewing the problem from a different angle.  The Government ofIndia have presumably based their opinion on the, assumption that  Russian aggression in northern Afghanistan cannot be repelled : we, on tho other hand, are working  onthe assumption that  it can, and  must lie.  repelled,  and that the  military  measureswhich have been indicated in Part V will be undertaken to that  end.  On  this basisit, appears to  us that our chances of success  would  be materially enhanced if bothextensions were effected in peace.   But we recognise that tho problem is not governed by military considerations alone, and that we may have  to undertake tho constructionof only the one or the other extension, should  the choice lie with the King.  Therelative values of these two alternatives, therefore,  merit some consideration.  If, at theKing*s invitation, we were able to construct in peace time the extension from Chamanto Kandahar, we  should  gain this advantage, that  we could initiate our offensivecampaign  against  the Russians in the Herat Province three and a  half months earlier than if  this extension had to be built after the outbreak of war.   On the  other hand,it is essential that our forces should  be in a position, as soon after the beginning ofhostilities as possible, to  repel a Russian advance on Kabul  over the  Hindu  Kush,which we are told  may take place  about three months  after  they have  crossed theOxus.   The  British  forces  necessary to  meet this advance will have to depend on a road line of communications, which will absorb considerably more thanlndiVs existing resources in mechanical transport, until such time as a railway  can be  built.  Theconstruction of such a railway involves great engineering difficulties, and its completionis estimated to take at least. 12 mouths.    In view, therefore, of the relative speed with which the southern extension can be built, as well as of the great  strategical and political importance  of preventing theRussians  from crossing the Hindu Kush and occupying Kabul, the demands of thesituation will be better met if the King can be induced  to place the extension of theline from Landi Khana to Kabul first in his programme of railway  construction.    70.  The conclusions which we have reached after a careful examination  of this difficult problem in all its bearings are these :-     (a) From our point of view, railway extension  into Afghanistan is desirable on         political,  economic  and   commercial  grounds.  As  regards  strategical         considerations, the  proposition cuts both  ways.   On  the one  hand the         ,l non-conducting&quot; qualities of Afghan territory are an appreciable  insurance         for  the security of India ; on the other hand they are a formidable obstacle         to our effective intervention in northern Afghanistan.             On the  whole,  then, we may regard railway  extension  in Afghanistan,         provided  that  it  takes  tho right  form, at least with  equanimity,  if not         with satisfaction.     (6) But, whatever our views in the matter, railways  in Afghanistan are bound to         come sooner or later  at  the instance of the King himself;  and  it, is agreed
        on all sides that it would bo calamitous, militarily ami politically, if Russia        were to gain the initiative over us in this matter.   It is justifiable to assume        that the King  will make us die first offer.  If we discourage  him, or even        if  we show symptoms of holding aloof, we shall  be  risking those  very        consequences which  must  at almost any  cost  be avoided.  We  consider,        therefore, that, our Minister at Kabul should be instructed  not to make the        first  move  in  the  matter, even to the. extent  of encouraging  the Amir to        broach the subject;  but that when, and if, the  Amir  does  so of  his own        accord,  he  should   receive the proposal  sympathetically,  ascertain  his        intentions as fully as possible, and submit a detailed report of  these to His        Majesty&apos;s (Jovernineut.       The actual programme of construction cannot, of course, be determined until        the Amir&apos;s wishes arc  known, but, generally speaking, wo  are inclined to        think that the extension  from Landi Khana to Kabul should be the first stage        in the programme and the  linking up of Chaman to Kandahar the second.        Wo suggest that the whole question should  be again examined in  India in        the light  of  tin; findings  of this  Report, in  order  that  the strategical,        commercial, technical and  financial aspects of tho various alternatives may        be duly weighed before  tin; necessity for a  decision arises.                    VIII.-The  Announcement  of our Policy.   71. In conclusion, it remains to consider whether any public announcement of our policy  should  be made ;  and  if so, in what form.   If wo do not apprise  Russia of our decision, it. will  have no  preventive force.  If, ou the other hand,  our decision isannounced  to  Russia, it  could not be kept secret from Afghanisation.  There wouldthen be the danger that the King would  adopt an arrogant attitude towards Russia;and we should have surrendered  the  issues of peace or war  with the  Soviet to theincalculable actions of an  unbalanced ami  unscrupulous  barbarian.   If it should  bedecided that any public  pronouncement of policy  should be made, we suggest thatit should be couched in language which leaves our discretion  unfettered.   The sort of formula  we have  in mind is :         &quot;That  Britain  could never  regard with  indifference the interference by a       foreign Power in the existing territory of  a friendly Afghanistan, but that the       exact steps which ought,  in  that event,  to  be  taken must depend tipou the       circumstances of the moment.&quot;    The decision as to whether an announcement should or should  not  be made should obviously rest  with the  Cabinet.                                    -(Signed)     I3IRKENHEAD (Chairman).

Copy  No.  25COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 232;;rf Meeting, held on January 26, 1928.          ******                         (2.) DEFENCE OF INDIA.                 (C.LD. Papers Nos. 158-D, 161  -D and  162-D.)           (Previous Reference: C.I.D. Minutes of the 223rd Meeting.)     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the First Report of the Defenceof India Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 158-D); together with the views of theGovernment of India on the Report (C.I.D. Paper  No. 161-D), and a summary of itsprincipal conclusions (C.I.D.  Paper No. 162-D).     THE PRIME  MINISTER said that he had  read this most important report with great interest, and that he warmly  approved of it.  In view of the  fact that nearly all the Members of the Committee of Imperial Defence had served on theSub-Committee  which  had   produced  this  Report, prolonged  discussion wouldprobably be unnecessary.     LORD BIRKENIIEAD said  that the Report spoke for itself.  It was mostgratifying  that the Viceroy  and  his Council had accepted its findings in  their entirety, subject to two very minor verbal safeguards, to which no exception could betaken.  The Committee had at first been  confronted with a very sharp division ofopinion as between the military advisers at Home and the military advisers  in India;and it was. therefore, a source of particular satisfaction that such complete agree-ment had been  reached.  Lord Birkenhead expressed his indebtedness to all hiscolleagues on the Committee,  and paid  a  warm tribute to the work of Sir maurice hankey and Major Ismay.  He added that he would like to incorporate the two small amendments which had  been  suggested by  the Viceixty  (see  C.I.D. PaperNo. 161-D) before the Report went fo the Cabinet.     SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN  observed that he was the only member of thepresent Committee  who  had  also served  on the Committee under Lord Balfour&apos;chairmanship, which had commenced its enquiries  into this question as far back aslMVI.  It was a singular testimony to the work of Lord Balfour that their conclusions should have been so completely reaffirmed.     LORD LOVAT hoped that the question of the notification  to the dominions of the policy recommended in the  Report  would be settled at an early stage.   he saw no reason to suppose that the  Dominions would take  exception to this policy;but it  was  possible that they might ask  whether  the best course would not be toendeavour to secure the admission of Afghanistan to the League of Nations, so that,in the event  of Russian aggression, she  would be able to claim the benefits ofArticle N of the  Covenant.    SIR AUSTEN  CHAMBERLAIN observed that the Government of India heldstrong views  on  this  point.   They had, in fact,  specifically  cited  the  case of afghanistan as one of the principal reasons for their unwillingness to agree to the protocol.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that the question of the notification to theDominions of the findings of the Report would be settled by the Cabinet.      [17109-2]
                            CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed (a.) To approve the Conclusions contained in the First Report of the Defence of       India  Sub-Committee  (C.I.D.  Paper  No.  158-D),  which  may  be       summarised as follows :        (1.)  The material consequences of any substantial Russian encroachment             into Afghanistan would be no less dangerous to India, and no less             disastrous to our general interests at the present time than they             were in the past.  The question of the policy to be adopted in the             event of such encroachment turns on whether we have the military             power to enforce it.  (Paragraphs 30-35.)       (2.)  To approve in principle the plan which has been drawn up by the             Chief of the Imperial General Stall&apos; in consultation with the Chief             of the  Air Stall&apos;; and, in particular, to endorse the conception             of the  execution of  the operations  on  the southern  line  of             advance in  Afghanistan by means of mechanised and air forces.             (Paragraphs 30-40.)       (3.)  In so much as the above  plan  holds out a reasonable prospect that             the  northern frontier of Afghanistan can be recovered by direct             military  action,  provided  that  our antecedent  preparation  is             adequate, and that the  Empire is  prepared to make the necessary             effort, to adopt, mutatis  mutandis, thereaflirmationof the principle             enunciated by Lord Balfour in 1903, and endorsed by Lord Morley&apos;s             Committee in 1907. &apos;* that, by our own  plain interest, our obliga-             tions to guard the independence and  integrity of Afghanistan             are  unimpaired, and  that the deliberate crossing of  the Oxus or             the  occupation of Herat by Russia would  be the violation of a             frontier which we are  bound to defend.&quot;   Also, following Lord             Morleys Committee,  to assume that, in the last resort. &quot; Russian             action  of the kind  indicated would be  followed  by a  declaration             of war against that Power.&quot;  (Paragraphs  41-42.)       (4.)  The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should, in consultation with             the Chief of the Air Staff and the General Staff in India, elaborate             his plan in full detail, showing what is contemplated at each stage             during the first year of a war, on the assumptions that                  (a) a violation of the frontier  of Afghanistan of such a nature             as to constitute, a casus belli had in fact taken place;                 (&amp;) conscription  would  not be enforced  during the first year             of war, but that up to  250.000  men of good quality would  be             obtained by voluntary methods in  the first three  months after the             outbreak of war.  (Paragraphs 43-44.)       (5.)  None of the operations which can be iindertake.ii in other  parts of the             world appear likely to be productive of decisive, or even  of very             important,  results; but the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should             continue their examination of this problem.   (Paragraph 45.)       (6.)  To commend  the whole question of  the  preparedness of the Army             and Royal Air Force in Tndia to  the serious consideration of the             Government of India.  In this connection, subject to any decision             that may later be taken  on  the wider question of whether India             pays too much or too little of the  cost of Empire defence.  Tndia&apos;s             responsibility for preparing, in time of peace, for the  problems             dealt with in this Report, will be discharged if her forces and their             equipment  are brought up  to  a  scale adequate for war with             Afghanistan  and the  tribes of the North-west frontier, or to             enable  India to co-operate with the Imperial  forces, in accordance             with the role assigned to her by agreement between His Majesty&apos;s             Government and the Government of India, in  the greater con-             contingency of war  with Russia in defence of Tndia.  (Paragraphs             46-49.)
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,     January 26, 1928.      (7.) A friendly Afghanistan being a primary  condition of the military            plans  referred  to  in  2  above,  it   is  important  that  any            opportunities of further improving our relations with Afghanistan            should be taken,  if possible.  Some of the measures which might be            adopted  to that end are:                 (a.)  Definite  acceptance of  the principle  of  assistance to            Afghanistan in the development of road and telegraphic communi-            cations with India.                (6.)  Assistance, both expert and financial, in the construction            of railways (see also Conclusion No. 10 below).                (c.)  Assistance in establishing  Exchange Hanks in  afghanistan-            stan.                (d.)  Assistance in reorganising the Customs  and  Post  and            Telegraph  Departments in Afghanistan.                ye.)  The establishment and  maintenance of a civil Air Service            between  Kabul and  Peshawar, conducted by British pilots,  and            subsidised by  the Government of India.  (Paragraphs 50-53.)      (8.) There would  be much advantage in                 (a) the substitution of Englishmen for Indians in  our Con-            sulates at Kandahar and Jalalabad; ami                (6) the establishment of Consulates, with British officers in            charge, at Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif.  (Paragraph 54.)      (9.) The strengthening  of  the  Afghan  Army  in peace  would, on the            whole, be to our advantage.   The Government of India  should be            invited to submit recommendations on this question.  Further, the            the measures whereby the Afghan Army could be  supported  and            strengthened  in  the event  of the emergency dealt with in  this            Report should lie pre-determined.   (Paragraphs  55-57.)      (10.) As regards railway construction  in Afghanistan :                 (a.)  On  the  whole  we  may  regard railway extension in            Afghanistan, provided that it takes the right form, at least with            equanimity, if not with satisfaction.                (b.)  Our Minister at Kabul should be instructed not to make            the first  move in this matter, even to the extent of encouraging            the King of Afghanistan to  broach the subject.   When, and if,            the King does so of his own accord, our Minister should receive            the proposal sympathetically,  ascertain his intentions  as fully            as possible, and  submit  a  detailed report  to His Majestv&apos;s            Government.                (c.)  The  programme of  construction cannot  be  determined            until  the King&apos;s  wishes are known; but it appears desirable that            the extension  from Landi  Khana  to Kabul should be  the first            stage, and  the linking up of Chaman with Kandahar the second.            In any event, the whole question should be again examined in            India in  the light of the findings of this Report,  in order that the            strategical, commercial,  technical  and  financial aspects of the            various alternatives may  be duly weighed before  the necessity for            a decision  arises.  (Paragraphs 5S-70.)      (11.)  If it should be decided by the Cabinet that any public pronounce-            ment  of  policy is to be  made,  it  should be  couched in  language            which leaves our discretion unfettered.   (Paragraph 71.)                            ((6.) That, after the minor amendments  suggested by the Viceroy had been      incorporated, the  Report should be submitted to the Cabinet.     -Jfr          ^          ifr          4fr           4t*          ^
