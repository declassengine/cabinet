CAB I N 3 T                     THE CHINESE BC3CEB INDEMNITY.      Note by  the Actin,-? secretary ci^State for the Colonies.^C.P.18(28)    The Treasury memorandum of tho 2 7th of January^          advocates a policy which involves the ropeal of the          China Indemnity  Application Act of 1925,  so that the          Boxer Indemnity Funds,  instead of being applied to educa-          tional  or other purposes beneficial to the mutual interest          of His  Majesty1 s Government and the i\opublic of China,          shall revert to the Exchequer in relief of the British          taxpayer,.               Without going so far as that,  it appears to me  that          the  course  of events  in China do call for  a modification          of the  decision approved by His Majesty&apos;s  Government in 19          Under that  decision the distribution of the x\md ,  instead          of being made by the  Secretary of State for Foreign  Affair          after consultation with tho advisory Committee,  was  to  be          made by a Board  of Trustees in China,  appointed  by the          Chinese Government in agreement with His Majesty1s          Government,  of whom six should  bo Chinese  ana  five British          In the  present state  of China both  the  appointment ox the          Trustees and  T,he  carrying  out  of any educational  schemes          in China are  alike impossible.   In  these circumstances  it          seems to me  that  the  policy of the  Act  of  1925 can be          carried  out  in part by  acceding to  the request put forward          on behalf of  the  University of  Hong   ong,  which is con-          veniently summarised  in the  recent  despatch  from the          Governor of  Hong Kong,  a  copy  of which is  sub-joinea to
     this memorandum-          It will be seen th t the University at present gives     an education in Lleiicino, Engineering acd Arts to seme     200 students, almost all of whom are of Chinese raco aud     rcany of Chinese nationality; but it is crippled by lack     of funds, which the Colony and the local public are     unable to supplement owing to the financial stringency     resulting from the prolonged disturbances in China.  In     partioular.  it is impossible to establish the much desired     School of Chinese Studies in the University without 3.azgely     Increased endowments.   It is for this reason that I desire     to commend to my colleagues the proposal of the Governor     that a part of the already accumulated Boxer funds, namely      1,404,000,  should be  made available for the development     of the University.   This would at once assist the Government     of Hont-- Kong &apos;which  has been hard hit by the disturbances in     China, yet at the same tii e it would not be open to the     criticism that the Indemnity Funds wore being spent for     our own ends.  It seems to me that this ?/ould be a desirable     middle course between  applying tho funds to our own financial     exigencies,  which might be open to obvious criticism,  and     handing it over to a Board of Trustees (which it is impossi-     ble to appoint) to distribute to educational establishments     which do not exist,  :;.nd which cannot be broixght into being,     until the apparently distant day when a government possess-     ing any sort of stability,  shall be re-establishea in  China.     *                                      W. 0--G.Colonial Office,     Downing Street,        1st February,  1928,
     Ccpx of Despatch from the Governor of Kong Kom^          jh e,,Jg^rilarof Sia be &quot;for  the   Col oioCe&apos;i7&quot;&quot;&apos;                                 GOVERNMENT HOUSE,                                      HONG KONG.                                 21st December, 192 7.Sir,     I have the honour to acknowledge Mr. Ormsby Gore13despatch Ho. 333 of the 5th November, 1927, regarding rayapplication cn behalf of the University of Hong Kong fora portion of the Boxer Indemnity Funds.2.   In my despatch Ho. 255 cf the 18th May,  1927,  I advisedyou that there was every prospect of the University having to close down,  at tho ond of 1928,  such existing Chinesework as it  had  been able to initiate at the beginning ofthis year by means of certain contributions raised in malaya, and that its activities would have to be generallycurtailed in other directions also.  The Finance Committeeof the University has recently been dealing with its esti-rrates of revenue and expenditure for 1928.   These estimates,though expenditure has been drastically reduced,  anticipatea deficit of over ^5,000 on the yearxs working, and insubmitting  them to the University Council,  the finance committee drew the attention of that body to  the University1sserious financial outlook,  pointing out that  its income is decreasing,  while the expenditure to which it standscommitted is automatically increasing,  and  that theInstitution has, in fact,  now reached a point at whicheither additional sources of income must  be found  orexpenditure must bo reduced with consequential reductionof its activities.3.   In my  despatch of the 16th  May,  1927,  I  explained thatthe present financial position of the Government  of Hong Kongis suoh that it cannot inorease  substantially its  grant  tothe University.  I added that it would  be difficult, if
 not  Impossible, to raise large local subscriptions-  I must here explain that the doc.-ease in  the University1 s income is not due  to any considerable falling off in the enrolment of students,  Since the anti-British boycott of 1925 the enrolment ha3 stood firm at a figure which ranges between 290 and 300; and the fee receipts during the current year are actually in advance of what was collected last year. But the University endowments are largely invested in localmortgages,  and, s.3 outstanding mortgages have been paid off, it has been found impossible to reinvest the capital at the same high rate cf interest which was previously obtainable. In this way the University^ annual income has already beenreduced b;. not less than ^20,000 and this particular difficulty is likely to continue and even to increase.4.   I have already addressed you with regard to the debtthat the Central and Provincial Governments of China oweto the University cn account of scholars sent by their; to theUniversity cn the basis of scholarships which were not  paid.This debt amounts to Sj114,690.  Most of the scholarsconcerned have left,  and new scholars are not beingadmitted on this basis.5*   The principal object with which the Hong Kong Univer- %aity was, with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government,established, is the higher education of the Chinese,  and Iconsider that  a reversion to the state of affairs obtainingup to the end  of 1926,  when the only Chinese study possiblein the University ended at the intermediate stage of the arts Faculty&apos;s curriculum,  would  be, at the present junctureso politically disastrous,  that,  though fully conscious ofthe possibility of failure,  I have decided  to launch a  localappeal for such capital sum as may be found  to be necessaryfor starting a Chinese  School in the University on a
 permanent  basis.   But  oven  if ruy appeal  be  in  a measure successful,  I do  net anticipate  that  the funds thus  raised v/iil  be  sufficient to  do more than  start the Chinese School in  a  very  rudimentary  form-.   Building must be erected before even  the most rudimentary Chinese School can  be reasonably accommodated *  Khia vrill add  substantially to  the initial  capital cost which  must  bo collected,  and  over  an! above the  insistent demands for  a Chinese School,  thoUniversity is  fac?d with the  alternative  either of finding additional money to finance its  existing  Faculties of Medicine,  Engineer!ng and Arts,  or of curtailing seriously the work which it  is now attempting. 6.    In these circumstances I should bo  failing in ray duty, if  I  did not emphasise once more the serious loss  tc  British influence  in the Far East which the curtailment of the already inadequate activities cf the Hong Kong  Universitywill  involve, and repeat my suggestion that out of the money now lying  in tho Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank the capital sum for which the University has asked,  namely  1,404,000, shouldbe made available for the University1 c development. 7o    In your despatch under reply you remind me that  theproposal made by the China Indemnity Advisory Committee,involves the appointment in China of a Board of Trustees,to whom all applications for grants  should be made, &apos;^nd  youimply that  all action directed towards the constitution  ofsuch a Board being at the moment in  suspense,  pay applicationfor-a grant for the University cannot  be considered,8..   If you will  turn to your secret despatch  of the  12thJanuary,  1927,  you will find that,  though you  did  not feel justified in requesting that the application of the reportof the Advisory Committee appointed  under the  China Indemnity (Application) Act,  1925,  should be deferred, pending  theconsideration cf  my secret  despatch  of the 18th October, 1926,
you  told  me  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government had not reached  adooislon  with  regard  to  the  introduction of  the  legislativelymeasures  required to  give  effect to  the Committee&apos;srecommendations, and  assured  me that no such decision wouldbe taken  without full consideration of my   representation on behalf of the University  of Hong Kong.  I trust that  Iam right  in  assuming  that  His Majesty1s Government is stillundecided with regard to the  Advisory Corrmitteo&apos;s recommenda-tions.9.    In my secret despatch of the 16th October,  1926, Iventured  to  criticise the  proposed establishment in Chinaof such a Board of Trustoos  as the J^advisory Committeoadvocated.   If in October, 1926, the proposal was irnpractica--blo;   it  i3  far more  impracticable now.  I need  not emphasisethis point;  but I venture to remind you that there is notat the moment visible any  sign of any possible lull in thestorm of  faction which is devastating China.  The presentanarchy in China may well  continue for many years to come.Indeed Iz is difficu3.t at  the moment to see what can end it,save utter war-weariness end  complete exhaustion.  but against this possible solution one has to sot. the fact thatChina is  a vast country and  thai, the number of political&quot;Generals&quot; eecms almost unlimited.  Meanwhile,  unlesrsomething is done,  the University of Hong Kong,  the onlyBritish University in the Far East, and the one  institution of higher learning where tho  sons and daughter a  of self-respecting Chinese can be  educated in peace and  security and upon sane and  sound principles, will be e^her cricpled ormoribund.&apos; Mo institution can stand still,  least of all a university.  I need not remind you of the extreme difficultywhioh you are now experiencing in the recruitment of cadetsand  of educational officers  for the Hong Kong Civil Service,The  Hong  Kong University will have for some time yet to recruit tho  greater part of  its staff in England.  But thisrecruitment, which has never  been easy, is rapidly becoming                              -6-
I have,  etc.-,(Signed)  C CLEMSHTI.              Governor,  &amp;c.The Right Hon. L.S. Amery, M.P.,        etc., etc.,impossible.  &apos;.Vhy should young men of promise come out to a university in the Par Last, which is merely struggling tomaintain an uncertain and unsatisfactory e-istenoe?  If HisMajesty&apos;s Government will but decide that the University ofjHong Kong is an institution with which, in the interests of&apos;British influence and British trade in the Far East, theBritish Smpire cannot afford to dispense, and will take this opportunity of helping the institution as such, the wholeoutlook of the University would change.10.   Payment to the University of the suggested contribution from the Indemnity money, which has already been collectedand is now lying idle in the Hong :long and Shanghai Bank,would not involve the rejection by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof the Advisory Committee&apos;e report.  If the Indemnitycontinues to be collected (and if it is not collected,  then the Committee&apos;s report ceases to have any practical appllca-tion) future fund can still be handled in the manneradvocated in the report of the Advisory Committee.
