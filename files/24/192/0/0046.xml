This Document is  the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.&apos;!263Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.                                            Copy  No.  30CP.  46  (28).CANADA AND THE  EMPIRE.       MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.     THE  first reaction of the last imperial Conference in Canada has been not altogether unlike its  first  reaction in South Africa.   In each case  its conclusions were suspect to many good Imperialists, because a party leader, bitterly criticised for  lukewarmness,  if  not  hostility, towards the Imperial idea, had fathered  andcommended them.  In South Africa Smuts*s criticism, indeed, was that nothinghad been achieved which he had  not secured previously; only among the Natal  die-hards was there any  disposition  to resent the theory of equal status as such.   InCanada the tendency of Conservative critics has been rather to deny that there isor can  be any true equality, basing themselves partly on the narrow legal point ofcertain existing statutes, including the British North America Act itself, which  stilllimit Canadian jurisdiction, partly on the general absurdity of the claim that canada is yet  equal  to Britain.   In so far  as their criticism  has appealed  to theintense suspicion of the French Canadian of the idea of any authority  in Canadainterpreting the British North America Act, it has been politically effective; apartfrom this it has been tactically mistaken, for it can only strengthen the desire tomake equality real by getting rid  of any legal anomalies, and to emphasize the claimto status without regard to practical advantage.  My own line, as in South Africa.was everywhere to begin  by explicitly insisting on  the general equality, and sosecuring Liberal approval,  and then to go on to point out that it is a real and fruitfulequality in Imperial  responsibility and not merely a formal equality, thus pleasingthe Conservatives, and, I hope, also turning their minds in the direction of a more constructive  line  of  criticism   if  the Government  should  disregard  the trueimplications of the Conference and pursue a  policy of non-co-operation in Imperialaffairs, coupled with  an ostentatious over-emphasis of its formal claims to equalityin the international sphere.     That issue has been raised directly by the announcement that Canada pi*oposesto have French and Japanese Ministers at Ottawa and appoint Canadian ministers in Paris and Tokio.   The experiment of a Canadian  legation at  Washington  has undoubtedly been a success. Mr. Massey  has not only worked in closest harmony with the Ambassador, but has helped to make Americans realise, as they  have neverdone before, that Canada is a willing and active  partner in the British family.  Asfar  as  Washington is concerned, the addition of Australian  and South AfricanMinisters to the British diplomatic family would probably only be to the good.  Thecase for Canadian  Ministers in France and Japan is weaker, or  at any rate  lessurgent, on the practical issue.  Neither the exceptional volume of work  to be donein Paris nor the Japanese  immigration  question  in British Columbia would appearto constitute a very strong justification for  haste in a step which may have far-reaching consequences.   Mr. Mackenzie King, indeed, takes the view that his two new appointments between them  will cover Europe and Asia, and  that he will  not want to make any further  ones, while at  Ottawa two other foreign  Ministers willbe sufficient to balance the  unique position at present occupied by Mr. Phillips,  theAmerican Minister.   But it is difficult to see how a request from Germany or Italyfor direct representation could long be resisted, nor will the gradual  growth of  the diplomatic corps at Ottawa be displeasing to national pride.  Meanwhile, the newmove is certain  to  be  freely criticised,  and  not  by  political opponents  only.Mr. Taschereau, the  ablest as well as the most powerful man in  French Canada,summed it up  to me as merely the outcome of Senator Dandurand&apos;s  vanity, fed onflattery at the League of Nations;  and the personal aspect of the new appointmentsis likely to be closely scrutinized.       [17225]                                                         B
     These developments have, however, inevitably  forced  the  pace with another outcome of the Imperial Conference, viz., the personal representation of the British Government at Ottawa.  Here the question is essentially one of practical advantage and not of status.  But, throughout our conversations on this subject, Mr. Mackenzie King, while fully  in agreement with me that the position and functions of such a representative were and should be kept entirely distant from  those of a  foreign minister, insisted  that Canada would  regard it as a sign of lack of interest on our part in her affairs if we did not appoint a representative who  both in ability and in externals could hold his own with the American Minister.  This will be no easy matter.   Mr. Phillips is a  man of quite exceptional personal charm as well  as of good sense,  and it is no exaggeration  to say that he  has captivated Ottawa.   The fact that he resigned an Embassy to take up the Legation at Ottawa is an obvious compliment to Canada&apos;s importance.  He  has already got handsome offices and  is having a fine house built for him, where  his wealth &quot;will enable him to entertain generously.   I do not think myself that a British representative need compete, in his scale of  entertainment,  with the American Minister.   In public opinion,  if not in constitutional logic, the Governor-GeneraFs entertaining will, for the time being at  any rate,  meet the case.   But I  am  convinced that in every other  respect Mr. Mackenzie King is right, and that we ought to appoint to Ottawa, and without delay, a representative who in personal qualifications and general status  will at ieast hold his own with the American Minister, and who will  be  suitably  accom- accommodated both  as regards office, private residence and  personal staff.   Mr. Phillips, 1 should add. has two assistants, both men of ability and  good personality, over and above the necessary office staff.     The question of the official status  and  title of the proposed  representative was very fully discussed betweeen us, though I took care to make it clear that I was in no position to commit my colleagues. *&quot; Mr. Mackenzie King explained that, as far as formal precedence  was concerned, he  would have liked,  in  order  to  impress Canadian public opinion, to give the British representative regular precedence over all  foreign representatives.  I  pointed out that  there was  an essential difference between  the courtesy  status  given  to  the  representative  of  another  Crown or Sovereignty,  however  unimportant, and the status  due to the representative of another Government under the same Crown, a Crown already represented on the spotby the King himself or by  the Governor-General.  Apart from the difficulty the Foreign Secretary  in Great  Britain might  have  in giving the High  Commissioners precedence over foreign Ambassadors,  I imagined Mr. Mackenzie King  would not wish, when in London, to go behind his High Commissioner, or expect Mr. Baldwin,when in Canada,  to rank after the British representative.   Mr. Mackenzie King entirely agreed, and thought that the correct precedence would be that enjoyed by Dominion High Commissioners in London, viz.,  after Cabinet Ministers  but before other members of the Privy Council (in this  case the Privy Council of Canada).  Themain thing, he felt, was that  in actual influence and authority with both Governmentshe should be, and  be known to be, a  more important personage than the foreign Ministers.  He added that he would like this to be the case in London as  well, towhich  I rejoined that this  Avas mainly a  question of the personal ability of the Canadian High Commissioner and of the confidence his own Government extended to him.  We on our side were always ready to extend our confidence to him,  if desired, on all subjects and to give him direct access to all departments or to the Committeeof Imperial  Defence, and, in general, to  give him no less consideration  than to  a member of the Dominion Government.     On the question of title,  we  agreed  that   &quot;Minister&quot;  was  undesirable  assuggesting that the appointment was similar in character to that of a foreign repre-seiitativer and  that there was  a  danger, if no  definite  and distinctive  title  were adopted from the first, of the press and  public getting into the way of speaking of the &quot;British Minister  at Ottawa.&quot;  He seemed to be at first a  little doubtful whether &quot;High Commissioner&quot; was important enough.   I pointed out that for us a title associated with the Governor-Generalship in  South Africa, and  with a position in Egypt and Iraq which took precedence over all foreign diplomatic representatives, would certainly not sound insignificant; my only  doubt was  whether my  colleagues would approve as  high-sounding a title,  and might not prefer a more modest one,such as &quot; Commissioner,&quot; which might  become &quot; High  Commissioner &quot; later on.  He thought that would be a pity; the right note as to the importance of the office should be struck at  the outset.  I have no doubt that he is right on this point.     On the more important  question of the functions of the post  and of the kind of
                                       a person who should be appointed in the first instance,  Mr. Mackenzie King spoke very frankly  and explicitly.  What he  wants  is someone with whom  he can talk freely on every kind of subject affecting inter-Imperial relations without being put in the position  of having  consulted  us  on paper, and having  possibly to produce telegrams or despatches.  He gave as instances of the need for such a person which he had felt during the last few months : (1) the recent decision to build two destroyers, on which  he would  have liked to have done a good  deal  more  in  ascertaining Admiralty views if he could have talked to someone; (2) the question of the proposed- ocean waterway to the Great Lakes, on which he would like us to keep in touch from tho point of view of its effect on our trade and shipping;  (3) economic questions generally.  I asked whether he would not wish  to discuss foreign policy as well.  He agreed, and  thought it desirable that the British representative should  know some- thing of foreign policy, or have someone, on his  staff who did. but he said he did not want a diplomat.  He wanted a general representative  with whom he could  discuss all inter-Imperial questions, someone who could deal with all the British departments and  knew  all  the Governments  of  the  Empire and the  business  of  Imperial Conferences.     If Canada were a foreign country we should obviously have at least a Legation. probably a full-fledged Embassy at  Ottawa. That she  is part of the Empire only means that she is much more important to us than any  foreign country.,  and much more worth taking trouble to  keep in touch with.   But apart from these general considerations, there is a factor which weighs to some extent in  the case of every Dominion, but quite  particularly  in  the  case of  the  present Prime  Minister of Canada.   Mr. Mackenzie King is morbidly  afflicted  with  the &quot;Downing Street complex.&quot;&apos;   He dislikes consultation  through  his High Commissioner in London because he fears the possibility of the High  Commissioners gradually forming a sort of Imperial Council round the Foreign Secretary or Dominions Secretary.  He also, as already mentioned, dislikes committing himself  to paper in documents which his Parliament might ask for.  But he longs for discussion which does  not so directly commit him.  and is as reasonable and as easily convinced in conversation as he is evasive and difficult over the cables. There is the further  point that whereas  any cable or despatch from London on  any subject goes to the Department of External Affairs, and comes to the Cabinet afterwards as a  matter of high policy, a  British High Commissioner would be in natural and continuous touch with Ministers  and departments individually, many of whom, like the Minister of Trade and Customs and the Minister for Defence, are eager to co-operate whenever they  can, and could enlist their personal support for British proposals or the consideration of  British interests before formal Cabinet discussion.  If we  want Canada to co-operate with us effectively, we must adopt the only method by which any real progress can be made with the Canadian Premier and his Cabinet.   My  conclusion, therefore, is that we should proceed to appoint as High Commissioner to Canada the best all-round man available, and equip him with whatever staff may be necessary to enable him to fulfil his varied  duties.     One subject of the first importance where it Avas obvious to me that effective co-operation is precluded by  the absence of a representative of standing,  able to discuss matters on  an equal  footing with Ministers, is  migration.   The subject is one in which Mr. Mackenzie King has  taken  very little personal interest,  and  he has assigned it to one of the weakest members of his Cabinet.  The  consequence is that  it is entirely controlled by civil servants terrified  by Parliamentary questions and under the spell of the years of depression since the war, the actual head of the department,   Mr.  Egan,  a  man  of ability  and  autocratic  temperament,  being fundamentally opposed to the whole idea of assisted migration, or,  at  any rate, to Canada&apos;s paying her proper share of it.  If we like to pay for relieving ourselves of our unemployed, that is  our  affair!  I did what I could  in my speeches  and in conversation with Ministers to explain the true situation and the attitude with which we approached  lLo  problem of co-operation in  migration, but only a permanent representative with  opportunities  of  meeting  Ministers  continually  can  really produce a  lasting impression.   Nor can anyone except  such  a representative deal effectively  with  the many cases of grievous hardship reacting most unfavourably on the whole movement of migration to Canada which are continually arising owing to the red  tape  lines  on which  the  immigration regulations  are  interpreted. Representations at the London end are  simply telegraphed to the department and receive a departmental reply; only a representative at Ottawa can see the Minister himself.  It  may be added that the attitude of the Government on  immigration is       [17225] &apos;                                                      B 2
the subject of very widespread criticism all over  Canada.  Mr. Bennett,  the newleader of the Opposition, has selected it as his first point of attack, and has, I under-stand, already succeeded in securing a committee of inquiry into the whole subject.    However important proper organisation in Canada and  effective co-operationbetween the British and Canadian Governments may be in this matter, the reallydetermining  influence is  the general economic prosperity of the  country.   that canada  has turned  the corner  of the post-war  depression  is  unquestionable.Everyone  is confident, and if there is not  the  exaggeration of  the boom period of1908-12, there  is a much  fuller realization of the  immensity of  Canada&apos;s resources.The discovery of a new quick-ripening wheat has added another 100 miles of depthto  the whole  prairie  wheat belt,  while still  further north experience has  nowdefinitely established the Peace River Valley, with at least 10,000,000 acres of arable land  awaiting  cultivation,  as  a  part  of  the great Canadian  wheatfield.   Moreimportant still, the great belt of pre-Cambrian rock, which  hems in all  northernQuebec and Ontario,  separates Eastern  from Western Canada by a thousand miles of wilderness covered with stunted timber,  and then  runs northwards to  the Arctic,is gradually being proved to be one of  the most highly mineralised regions  of  the earth surface, and may, before long, become tiie workfs biggest producer of gold andother precious and base metals, as it already is of  nickel and asbestos.  Every year,too, is bound to witness a  rapidly increasing development of canada  immenseresources in water power.    No Canadian doubts that Canada is destined  to have a great economic future.The question which does worry  every  thoughtful Canadian  is how  Canada is  tosecure the greatest development,  and secure it consistently with her own politicaltraditions and  the preservation of her own  independence.  It is impossible to  under-stand the Canadian  outlook either upon  national or  Imperial problems withoutrealising  the immense, overshadowing  effect upon it of the  United States.  Theincredible development of wealth and economic power which  we know as a matterof  statistics, but have not even  dimly  begun to realise,  is  to Canadians  an overwhelming,  omnipresent, blatant fact, sucking out from Canada the bulk  of hernatural increase of population  as well as the best of her brains, and in  returnsteadily acquiring control of all her natural assets and of her biggest  industries.There is no deeper fundamental  instinct of the Canadian national character thandislike of the United States as belonging  to an inferior political civilisation thanthe British Empire.   But the din and glare of the great American  orchestra make sit difficult for Canadians to think of anything else, and nothing of  recent times hasbeen  so welcome or so helpful as the speeches which  the Prime Minister made  tothem about England  last summer, or. in a lesser degree, what  I have been able tosay to them of the other Dominions and of  my conviction that  the British Empire isdestined far to outstrip the  United States,  even in the economic  field, once we begin to co-operate effectively together!    The economic problem  for Canada  really  resolves  itself into a choice between three alternative policies.  The first is the policy of entering  into the Americaneconomic system.  That policy offers the largest immediate returns.  It would open the American market to  Canada&apos;s primary products, and would secure unlimitedcapital  for the further development of her primary  production.  But the mainresult of such  a  policy  would  be the  yet  further aggrandisement of Americanindustry,  the strengthening  of American  against Canadian  railways, the definitestereotyping of Canada&apos;s development as that of an  economic  appanage or province of  the American system, and in the end Canada&apos;s  political subjection to  the UnitedStates.   It is a policy contrary to all the  natural instincts of  Canadians.   But itfinds considerable favour with the cosmopolitan population of the prairie provinces and,  as a free trade policy, with Liberal  theorists  and with dissatisfied interestsboth  in the West and  in the Maritime Provinces.  The Liberal Party habituallytoys with it, but, no less habitually, under the influence of the Quebec vote, which isas  solidly protectionist as it is solidly Liberal, refrains from  any decided action inthe direction of American reciprocity the experience of 1911 is not very likely toencourage another attempt.     The second policy is one that would seek at all costs to  maintain Canada&apos;economic  independence by a high tariff against the United States and the world at large.  It pays America the compliment of imitation rather than that of surrender,and aims at building up  in Canada a self-contained economic development parallel with  that of the United States.  It is a policy more consonant with Canadian nationalfeeling and probably better  calculated  in  the long run to promote an independent
all-round  development  of Canada&apos;s resources.  But it tends to ignore  certain essential underlying geographic and  climatic facts which differentiate Canada from her great neighbour, and make it impossible for her to achieve the fullest success bythe same methods.  The United States is a single, square, compact block of territorym which no part is geographically isolated from the rest.  At the same time it coversso wide a  climatic  range  from  north to  south  that it can produce  within itself atany rate  the  bulk  of all the  foodstuffs and  raw materials required by  moderncivilisation. A policy of internal development is consequently a  natural one for theUnited  States, whether regarded from the  point of view of  transportation or fromthat of the correlation of resources.  Canada,  in fact if not on the map, is still along strip, and. what is  more, an intermittent strip, of developed territory, withwilderness to the  north and wilderness separating its more populated sections. Herresources,  in ultimate volume perhaps no smaller than those of  the States,  are farnarrower in their climatic range. She is bound to look much more to her export and import trade, and any overtightening of the bow of protection tends at once not onlyto affect her external trade, but, more  serious politically, to  set up antagonismbetween her manufacturing centres and  the primary  producers, who feel  that theyhave to pay not merely for the tariff, but for the long railway hauls as well. Theresult is that the Conservative Party, the exponent of Sir J. A. Macdonald&apos;s national policy,  while it wins  elections whenever  the Liberals oscillate too  far towards free trade or American reciprocity, cannot  win them on the mere issue  of a  highertariff as  Mr.  Meighen learnt lo his cost a  year ago and pursues, when in  ollice, afiscal policy very  little different from that of its opponents.    The third alternative is to endeavour to combine the advantages and overcome the disadvantages of each of these policies by a policy which is sufficiently protectionistagainst the United States to safeguard Canada*economic independence, and yet keepsdown prices for  the Canadian  consumer,  encourages  Canada&apos;s export trade, andsecures  for her an  abundant supply of  the food-stuffs and  raw materials of otherclimates.  Such a policy  is to  be found in the effective development of imperial preference.  Even  as  an unreciprocated and  tentative policy  on  Canada*s part,Imperial Preference has stimulated  her  export trade, made a great portion of herimport  trade  pay  the long  haul to Canadian railways instead  of to Americanrailways, with only a short haul over the Canadian railways at the end. and keptdown prices to the  consumer.  Tt was as  a  policy on  its own merits, apart from thereciprocity he eventually  hoped  to secure, that  Sir W. Laurier  always defended  itin Canada, and it  would. I believe,  pay Canada  to-day to go further in the samedirection,  increasing,  say. her preference from a third to one half of the  generalduties, without waiting for further  reciprocity on our  part.  But undoubtedly theadvantage  to Canada of a policy of  Imperial Preference (and the advantages to us of the development of Canada under such a policy) would be far greater if  it werepart of a  wider scheme in which we reciprocated effectively.  Under such a policy the growth of Canada, and of British  trade  with Canada, would be  immenselyaccelerated.  With the markets and resources of the  Empire in  large measureassured to her, Canada could really  hope to compete with, conceivably some day tooutstrip, the United  States, and we. on our  side,  would  participate in steadily increasing measure in  her  development.  Migration would naturally  follow and receive confident  and  consistent support  from the  Dominion Government.   capital would flow in, British as well as American,  in ever-increasing volume.  Last,  but not least, Canada&apos;s general  policy  in  Imperial affairs,  which, in  its vagueness and uncertainty, only reflects the  tentative and irresolute character  of her  present economic policy, would be  replaced by a policy both resolutely national and resolutelyImperial,  in keeping with an economic policy which would  both insure the  highestdevelopment, on Canadian soil, of Canada&apos;s resources, and enable her to play  a great,ultimately perhaps a  dominant,  part in the general economic development of theEmpire. &quot;Canada is, I believe,  not unprepared  to embark upon such a policy.  but she will ask for some  lead, at any rate, from us. and  from the point of view of ourown narrower interests, as well as from that of  Imperial unit v. it is up to us to givethatlead-                                                    L.
