(ggia jxculu^t la gnu pnopKagy or eis bikitaskic r.AJBSTY&apos;a ooysRMBNT)PROVISIONAL PROCSlAaaiE OP I.UCI3I.AII0B -       -KlfciaaKY Off ItlvAI/JH.  Memorandum by Minister of Health.In tho following Memorandum I hare taken no accountof a Bill for the reform of the poor lew, the introduction ofwhich depends on the decision on the Chanoellor&apos;s proposals for reform of the financial relations between the Exchequer and thelocal authorities.Poor law Reform therefore being excluded, Bills onthe following subjects have been under consideration for theforthcoming Session in the Ministry of Health(1) Local Aulijorities (jPinanaial Provisions)(2) national Health Insuranoe(3) Valuation Amendment, which might perhaps  be    taken in one Bill with(4) London (Valuation and Hating)(5) Railway Rating(6) Lunacy(7) Remuneration of RegistrarIt has also been proposed to oontinue the taBk of consolidatingthe various statutes under which the Ministry works by passingthis year a Pood and Drugs Consolidation Act.It will be observed that the above list does not include a Slum Improvement Bill.    My plans for dealing withthis problem are fairly advanced but I require more time forthe completion of the scheme and for the necessary consultations with local authorities and others interested.It could conceivably form part of the 1929 programme.(1) Local Authorities (Financial Provisions).          The Oabinet have already authorised the introductionof a Bill on this subject.C.&apos;S?.&quot;&quot;5(28)secret copy Ko.CASIK2T
 (2) National Health Insurance,           The basis of this Bill is the recommendations in tho Majority Report of the Hdyal-Oonuaission Which reported in February, 1926.          I have decided that it la impossible for several reasons to act at present on &quot;Wo of the recommendations, infavour of the abolition of Insurance Committees and of the partial pooling of surpluses of societies to secure theprovision of specialist services.           Ehero are,  however, a number of other recommendations which have been fully discussed and substantially agreed with the Approved Societies Consultative Council,   Societiesgenerally are very anxious that effect should be given by legislation to these recommendations.    As time goes on andno Bill is produced, unrest and uneasiness develops among them.   they have also a keen appreciation of the fact thatin addition to the Majority Report, there was a MinorityReport of the Labour representatives on the Royal Commissionproposing, amongst other drastic changes, the abolition ofthe Approved Society system.   Ehe political power and influence5of Approved Societies make it desirable in present oircximstanoes;to meet their views if possible, especially as they are still very sore over the Economy Act of  1926.          There is this also to be said, that in one respect the Bill would be a public health  measure of first class importance - namely In respect of  regulation of additionaltreatment benefits, mainly dental  and ophthalmic   Societiesere now spending about four millions a year on these benefits and they constitute probably the most important advance inpreventive health treatment made for many years.    At presentmy powers of controlling this large expenditure are wholly
 wholly inadequate,  ana the result is such constant friction                                         c between the  Societies and  the  professional concerned  that arrangements are  carried on with  difficulty and  in a  manner which leaves much to  be desired.    The  rectification  of this position would be an  undoubted asset to the  Government.           The  ill  proposed would be a  Committee measure to be  taken in  Standing  Committee and should  not occupy  more than one and  a  half day&apos;s  of the time  of the House as such. (3) Valuation Amendment.           The combined effect of  the Bating  and ValuationAct,  1925, and the Rent Restriction Acts,  as interpreted by the judgment of the Courts, gives  rise  to  a  situation of considerable  difficulty which in my view renders legislation inevitable and urgent.   The Rating  and Valuation Act, 1925,in the interests  of uniformity prescribed  a scale of  deductionswhich are  to  be made from the gross values of properties in determining rateable value;   this  general scale replaces veryvaried scales which are in  operation in different districts;the Act also prescribed the allowance to be made to owners inrespect of compounding, which it fixes at 10 per cent in place ofthe varied, and in many cases very larfee,  allowances at presentin operation.    By the decision of  the House of Lords in the caseof Nicholson v.  Jackson tenants have been receiving th.6 benefitof any compounding allowance on the increase of rates since 1914and the effect of decreasing the allowances is to increase the rents paid by the tenant,  quite apart from any increase of rent which may result from increases of rates or of assessments&apos;The effect of Hicholson v.   Jackson is anomalous, for the allowances are clearly owners&apos;  allowances for risks undertakenv. O -
 by them; in view of the House of Lords deciaion a reduction in the amount of allowances does not affect the landlord but takes from the tenant something which, he never ought to have had.  The bulk of tenants will not concern themselves, however, with the question whether Nicholson v. Jackson was equitable, but the fact that their rent is to be inoreased will appeal to them quite directly.          It was recognised in 1925 that fux*ther legislation on thiB question might become necessary.  In the course of the Debate, after referring to the decision in the case ofiliohol3on v. Jackson and pointing out that the 3111 provided that the proposed changes in the law relating to compounding should not cone into operation until after the expiration of the Rent Restrictions Act3 as they then stood, I went on:-     &quot;Hon. Members opposite may say:  &quot;But the Rent      Restriction Act3 may have to be prolonged, and may not      actually cone to an end when they are due to expire&quot;.  All      I can say iB, if that he so, that there is plenty of      time before us to consider what steps it may be      necessary to take, and I rn.ll go so far as to say that      we certainly should consider, in the event of any      prolongation of the Rent Restriction Acts, whether any      steps were necessary in order to provide against an      alteration in the existing practice.&quot; The effects referred to will make themselves felt on the coming into operation of the first valuation list under the rating and Valuation Aot, 1925.  In the great majority of cases the first valuation will come into operation on 1st April, 1929, but in a number of districts the date is 1st April, 1928.  Birmingham, for example, has ohoaen the earlier date and their revaluation is now practically complete, so that the extent of its effects oan be appreciated. It shoves that the rents of small weekly properties will be inoreaeed by varying amounts up to as much as 9d, or lOd. a tveek.          An attempt has been made to consider what is likely to happen generally.  Estimates are very difficult
to make, for exact information is not available, and it isnecessary to make a number of assumptions but the result ofthe examination of a number of sample districts leads to theconclusion that it is likely, in the absence of legislation,that there will be an average increase in the rents ofcompounded properties throughout the country of something inthe neighbourhood of 4d. or 5d.  a week.          It is proposed to meet this difficulty by providing that for the first valuation under the Pitting and valuation Act -     (a)  She scale of deductions from gross value for the          determination of rateable value shall be altered          so as to make the scale more generous for the          smaller houses.     (b)  To inorease the compounding allowance from 10 to          say 15 per cent.It is estimated that by this means it will be possible on thewhole to leave compounded property in practically the same position as at present, though the ohange to uniformity will of oourse mean that some tenants will pay slightly reducedrents while others will have their rents slightly increased.f -5  London (Valuation and Hating;],          There are three matters which make it necessaryto consider legislation dealing with valuation and ratingin London -     (a)  The necessity for putting something in place of          the temporary Valuation (Metropolis)  Amendment          Act,  1925.     (b)  The desirability of applying the provisions of          the Hating and Valuation Act,  1925, as regards          luting of machinery to London as nearly as possible
         contemporaneously with their coming into forca in         the Province- a .     (c) The desirability of general co-ordination of the         rating and valuation lav? in London with that in the         Provinces.The Valuation (Metropolis) Amendment Act, 1925, providedfor the ascertainment of rateable value by the use ofcertain scales of deductions from gross value.  It was expressed to apply for the quinquennial valuation of 1926only and it will be necessary to provide for a scale,probably different from that prescribed in 1925 to apnlyfor the 1931 valuation.   A Bill to deal with this should at latest be passed in the early part of the 1929 session, butlooking to the life of the present Parliament it cannot beleft till then and local authorities would bs justified in pressing that it should be dealt with in 1928.   The benefits of the rating of machinery provisions will in the majorityof districts come into operation in 1929 and it isimportant that the advantages of the provisions shall become available to London ratepayers at the same time .          The co-ordination of the London and Provincialcodes of valuation is very desirable and may be taken as generally agreed except as regards two important points,the abolition of the single valuation for rates and taxes and the revision of assessments in the interval between twoquinquennial valuations .  As regards the first the exchequer has an interest for the pommissioners of Inland Revenue areof opinion that the pressnt system involves them in serious losses.                  ;          There is much t&apos;p be said in favour of a comprehensive 3ill dealing with these questions and withthe matter referred to in-paragraph 3 under the heading
Valuation Amendment.  It must be recognised, however,  thatthere are questions arising in connection with the  general co-ordination of London Valuation with that  in the  Provinoeswhich might well involve so much controversey as to make  itImpossible to ensure the passing of the measure in reasonablet ime.          I am, therefore, of opinion that the best plan  willbe to deal with the Valuation Amendment point, the  analogousquestion of the replacement of the Valuation (Metropolis)Amendment Act, 1925, and the application of  the rating ofmachinery provisions to London in one short  urgent  Bill,leaving the more general question of the co-ordination of Loss ouand Provincial rating to a later date.          I am of course aware of the difficulty of passinglegislation before Easter.  Nevertheless I am bound to pointout that there are special oircumstances which make It extremely important to get this Bill through as near the 1st  of  Aprilas possible.          If th6 amending Bill did not pass  until June orJuly the result would be that local authorities adopting  theyear 1928 for their first valuation would make their rates onthe provisions of the 1925 Act as they stand in April,landlords would thereupon serve notices on their tenants  as required by the Sent Restriction Acts and would collectincreased rents and when the Bill passed fresh not Ices wouldhave to be served by the landlords and adjustments  made andthe looal authorities would be involved In very numerousadjustments In the rate and valuation hooks.(5) Railway Rating.          The Rating and Valuation Bill contained clauses
dealing with the valuation of railways designed to  secure the valuation of the railways in cumulo, and the apportionment  ofthe valuation &quot;between different areas:  these olauses were  notproceeded with through lack of time.  The present  position  ofrailway valuation is unsatisfactory to both local  authoritiesand railway companies, and legislation is urgently required:it is possible that it may suddenly become unavoidable.  Therehas been no re-valuation of railway properties since the war,and it is almost oertain that the application of pre-warpractice and Court decisions would, on account of  post warchanges in costs, result in impossible valuations.   Ifre-valuation took place in the absence of fresh legislation the local authorities would probably find themselves faced  withenormous losses of rateable value , and the rural areas would be especially hit.  And It is agreed on all hands that the presentmethod of parochial assessment is artificial, costly and unsatisfactory.  Since 1921 the pre-war assessments have been adjusted by the application of a percentage agreed between representatives of the local authorities and companiesnegotiating centrally.  It is an entirely extra-statutoryarrangement which may break down at any timer  It has resultedyear by year in reductions of railway rateable value, andlooal authorities, particularly the rurals, tend to become increasingly dissatisfied with the results of the  centralnegotiation:  the railway companies are also dissatisfied andit Is understood that they threaten to break away entirely from the present makeshift arrangement unless they  are given
given definite assurances that legis lation will be immediately undertaken to place railway rating on asatisfactory and permanent basis.          Representatives of provincial local authoritiesand the railway companies have been discussing the methodof a permanent solution for some eighteen months, and have prepared a Bill providing for a valuation in ouraulo whichis more or less completely agreed.          Negotiations are continuing and the Scottish and metropolitan authorities, whose concurrence will be necessary if an agreed measure providing for a valuation in cuinulola to be secured, are now taking part.   These negotiationsmay result in general agreement in the near future, and inthat case very strong, pressure is likely to develop to giveeffect to it by legislation in the coming session.          If agreement is not shortly reached, a difficult situation may arise.  Railway Companies will undoubtedlyconsider seriously the alternative of taking appeals under theexisting law against the individual parochial assessmentsthroughout England and Wales, and they may no iLonger be deterred by the considerations which have so far weighed withthem*  Such action may produce a position seriously affeotingthe finances of local authorities in a number of areas andmay necessitate legislation imposing some sort of temporarysettlement.
(6)  Lunacy.          As in the oa^e-Of-lT&amp;tiOTial-Beaajto^I am here in presenoe of the report of a strong BoyalCommiaBion whioh under the Chairmanship of Mr, H.P. Macmlllanmade a moat exhaustive enquiry into lunacy legislation and administration and furnished  a unanimous report inJuly 1926, proposing a considerable number of reforms.This report had an excellent reception and it ia highly desirable that effect should be given to it.  To do bo infull would rdquiro a Bill of suoh length and complexity thatit oould not be oonsidared at the present stage.  But thereare four recommendations cn which I think that early legislation is extremely desirable and would redound toour oredit as a government.  These are;-(a) the provision of powers to receive persons Bufferingfrom mental illness, but possessing volition, withoutcertification into all classes of mental institutions.Such persons oan now be reoeived only on payment in registeredhospitals and licensed houses.  Such a differentiation between the poor and the well-to-do ought not to oontinuea day longer and I am moreover advised that early treatmentwithout certification would have the moat potent results in reducing the number of those who now become certifiable:(b) power to local authorities to undertake out-patient treatment and after-care of those who are or have beenmentally afflicted and to undertake researoh - the case for these reforms does not need argument:(c) provision for certain further safeguards for the mediealprofession  in issuing certificates - at present the positionis suoh that modioal men hesitate to oarry out their duties
under the Lunacy Acts for fear of vexatious prosecutions:(d) reorganisation of the Board of Control on lines recommendedby the Royal Commission.          This measure might well be introduced in the Lords .(7) Remuneration of Registrars *          These officers have a grievance of long standing inthat in many areas their fees have not been increased as havebeen the emoluments of other officers in connection with theinorease in the cost of living.   They have behaved with verygreat patience, their claim oannot be disputed, and I am verydesirous of securing the legislation necessary to meet it.          Of the above measures, those which stand first in orderof urgency are the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions),National Health Insurance and Valuation Amendment Bills.   Thefirst of these must in any case be passed.   The seoond is notonly most desirable politically because the powerful interestsrepresented by the Approved Societies are pressing hard for it but is demanded on public health grounds in regard to thequestion of treatment benefits.   The third is In my judgmentpolitically necessary.          I must therefore urge most strongly that arrangementsbe made for the passing at least of these three bills.          As regards the other measures, I must admit that theydo not present the same case of urgency though I should be sorry to lose any of them and I must make it clear
oleax that in regard to railway rating  I  am oonfronted witha position of considerable  delicacy and difficulty.23rd January,  1928.
