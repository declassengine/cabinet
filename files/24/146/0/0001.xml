SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERALREPORT No. 1. .Imperial Conference.From a telegram since received it appears that the South African Ministers had not anticipated any discussion of future constitutional or commercial relations within the Empire while the war was still in progress. Discussion of these subjects is, however, desired by some of the other Dominion Governments, and it would be asking too much of Australasian representatives to leave these important questions aside for the moment, and be confronted with the possibility of being asked to come over again to deal with them a few months later. It is obvious, of course, that on a question like that of the future Imperial constitution nothing in the nature of final conclusions is likely to be reached on this occasion. The discussion of these and other matters of common concern affecting the internal relations of the Empire, rather than the actual conduct of the war and of British diplomacy, will presumably take place at the Special War Conference to be held at the Colonial Office and not at the War Cabinet.The Petroguad Conference.The admission of the Roumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Conference was urged on the ground that many questions directly affecting Roumania were certain to be discussed, but to avoid creating a precedent for the admission of the representatives of other Allied Powers outside the four principal partners, it was decided that he should only be invited to attend when Roumanian affairs were directly under discussion.Greece.The very satisfactory results of the policy decided upon at the Rome Conference indicate, on the one hand, that the Greek Government must have realised that no immediate help from the Central Powers would be forthcoming, and, on the other, that fear of being handed over to the Venizelists was the main motive of the earlier intransigeant attitude of the Army and the Royalist political leaders.The military threat to the rear of the Salonika Army may be said to have been effectively removed. A very marked difference of point of view as to the treatment of Greece still exists between the British and French representatives. But there is no longer any danger of French high-handedness embroiling us in serious military difficulties. The question now is really one as to the extent of equitable consideration due to Greece after her acceptance of the Allied demands. On this issue the French tendency is to continue exacting punishment as fully as possible, and to put forward other demands, such as the occupation of Volo, while that of the British representa-tives is, by keeping scrupulously within the terms of the Allied Notes and by reasonable concessions on points of detail, to make it easy for the Greek Army and Government to acquiesce in the new situation. .
Japan.The demand for an assurance of our support of Japanese claims to Shantung and the German islands north of the Equator raises both the general question of the desirability of any separate bargaining between members of the Alliance, and the internal difficulty which arises from the necessity of consulting the Australasian Dominions/with regard ,to* territorial changes in. &apos;thel Pacific.. The Japanese request has^rio doubt, been evoked by a request on our. part for Japanese naval assistance in the shape of additional torpedo boat destroyers for the Mediterranean and some light cruisers for the South Atlantic. It is obvious that but for the desirability of securing these ships as soon as possible it would have been preferable to let the matter stand over for discussion at the Imperial Conference. The islands in question have been in Japanese occupation since the beginning of the war.I, S. A.1st February 1917.

PART I.-BKITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.On 26th. January the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent a telegram to the Dominions, indicating some of the principal subjects which are likely to come up for discussion at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. The list, which is not intended to be exhaustive, includes:  (1) Increased efforts in prosecution of war, including shipping control, methods of recruiting, &amp;c.(2) Policy with regard to eventual terms of peace, including commercial and financial questions involved, as well as changes of territory.(5) Immediate problems arising on the conclusion of peace,eg., demobilisation, commercial arrangements (including treatment of British and German shipping) after the war, and Constitution of Empire.(4) Other subjects of common interest, but not immediately connected with the conduct of the war, like emigration, consular services, double income tax,, naturalisation and control of aliens, control of meat supplies, prize bill.In reply to a telegram from the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa the Secretary of State for the Colonies has telegraphed that it is not considered, possible to hold an Imperial Education Conference during the continuance of the war.CANADA.The proposal of the Indian Government and the Sikh rulers to send a Sikh mission to the United States and British Columbia to maintain orthodox Sikh principles among Sikh emigrants and to combat seditious tendencies is considered by the Canadian Government to be unnecessary as far as Canada is concerned.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The New Year expressions of goodwill and gratitude of the Belgian, Italian, Russian, Rumanian Governments have been conveyed to the Australian Government by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Western Australia.The Ministry has concurred in. the nomination of Sir \V. Macartney as Governor for three years.NEW ZEALAND.The Duke of Connaught has consented to be Colonel-in-Chief of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade.The 21st reinforcement has sailed.SOUTH AFRICA.His Majesty&apos;s Government has been asked by the Governor-General to give a &quot;lead&quot; to South African agriculturalists to produce the maximum amount of foodstuffs.RHODESIA.Native and European officers can and will be provided for further units desired by Army Council, who are also asked to sanction the immediate formation of a Rhodesian unit to be attached to an Imperial Battalion.NIGERIA.The French Governor of Dakar has asked us to construct a telegraph line from Kano to the frontier while he constructs it to meet us as far as Zinder. Civil servants are being urged to join the West African Rifles.
GOLD COAST.The recruiting campaign has began with some success, but cannot, in the opinion of the Officer administering the Government, be carried very far;iunless cadres of officers, commissioned and non-commissioned, are sent out from Europe.All public expenditure is to be curtailed (estimated surplus for 1910, 6S0,000Z. ; revised estimate for 1917, 780,0001.); The Officer administering the Government reports the Executive Council hesitate to lock up so large a sum as 500,000Z. in the War Loan, as the Colony has been asked to do.LIBERIA.The British Political Representative has been instructed to remonstrate against the execution of Kroo chiefs.EAST AFRICA.The Governor of Nyasaland has been urged to make every effort to recruit native carriers for the East African, campaign, and informed that permission is being sought from the Portuguese authorities to do so in Portuguese East Africa.The Portuguese authorities have been asked by General Smuts to remove all food supplies from near the East African. Border, as the Germans will probably want to cross it in April for the purpose of obtaining food for their native troops.Tabora will be evacuated by the Belgians at the end of February.Enlisted German Askaris are to be formed into a third battalion of 3rd king&apos;s African Rifles.MAURITIUS.The gift of the Colon)&apos; to His Majesty&apos;s Government will take the form of 30 aeroplanes.MALTA.A representative is being sent from the Governor&apos;s office to London to act as a channel of communication with the Wheat Commission.part ii.-foreign affairs.ALLIED COMMON POLICY.At the Conference being held in Petrograd the Roumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs is not to be admitted as a regular member, but he will be invited to attend sittings on matters directly concerning Roumania.Meetings of Russian, French, Italian representatives, and representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government, opened in London on 29th January to discuss respective spheres of influence in Asia Minor, and are still continuing.FRANCE.Arrangements are being made so that the occupied districts of Northern France will be revictualled through, the &quot; Dutch Committee.&quot;BELGIUM.The Belgian Minister, M. Hevenith, in Washington, is to be replaced by M. Oar tier de Marchienne.ITALY.The prohibition of the export of oranges into Switzerland, with Germany as their probable ultimate destination, lias not yet been carried out.   The difficulty is financial.
His Majesty&apos;s Government do not wish to undertake an unlimited liability for the crop ; the Italian Government cannot, in the interests of the Italian growers, fix a limit of price in so fluctuating a commodity. The British Ambassador has, however, been instructed to protest against any of the fruit being allowed to go in this direction any further.His Majesty&apos;s Government has protested energetically against the arrangement to send 1,100 tons rice from Italy for beet from Switzerland as being really an exchange with Germany, especially as rice has been imported into Italy for Italian needs from British sources.Italy is suffering from shortage of British coal.GREECE.-Further steps have been taken to establish Allied control during the last week.On Monday, 22nd January, the British Minister at Athens was instructed, to allow no delay in. the exercise of control, or in the salute to flags ; the form of this last ceremony was settled on Saturday, 27th January, and carried out on Monday, 29th, with due propriety. Prince Andrew rode at the head of the procession. The demeanour of the crowd was respectful. Sir F. Elliot took the text of the letter of excuse and regret for the events of 1st December, required by the Allied Goverh-meiits, to the Greek Ministry of Foreign. Affairs on Tuesday, 23rd .1 anuary, and.this letter-was formally presented to the Allied representatives on Wednesday, 24th January. On 24th January the head of the Reservists&apos; leagues was ordered by the King to dissolve them all. On Friday, 26th January, a decree to that effect and a decree dismissing the 1st Army Corps commander were published. On Saturday, 27th January, Sir F. Elliot reported that the whole of the Greek Army, disorganised and incapable of action, was in the Morea, except what had been left in Northern Greece for police duties, and proposed that the blockade should be raised. The British Government favour this proposal, but the French War Committee do not, but are prepared to allow careful rationing.What exact number of troops are required for police purposes has not yet exactly been determined. The Greek General Staff have pleaded with, the Military Attaches for the retention of a certain number of troops in Thessaly and Western. Continental Greece to keep order there, and also to protect the railway. The points at which it is requested that troops should be retained are numerous, though the number in each case is small. On Monday, 29th January, the British Military Attache formally placed on record, that the Allied conditions had been of : were being; satisfactorily carried out.The Control Commission has. not worked with perfect smoothness. General Cauboue has constituted himself the agent and interpreter of what Sir F. Elliott calls the animosity of General Sarrail against King Constantine and his schemes for the military occupation of Greece : the authority of the French Government has been invoked by the Foreign Office to confine him within his province strictly and to his duties of supervising the fulfilment of the Allied demands. On Wednesday, 24th. January, the French Government made a proposal, to occupy Volo.The effect of the blockade has become acute and the anxiety of the Greek Government intense. Sir F. Elliott reported on 27th January that the country would soon be faced with famine conditions. He suggested the raising of the blockade and asked for limited supplies without delay. His Majesty&apos;s Government are considering rationing Greece on the basis of a fortnights supply of food. The French War Committee object to raising the blockade till all the conditions have been fulfilled, but would allow a very small amount of provisions in under strictest scrutiny.Venizelist Greece is faced with the same prospect of famine owing, as Lord Granville suggests, to the Provisional Governments - incapacity for organisation. He-suggests the Allies should undertake the supply of food themselves, at any rate for&apos; the moment-, without doing anything to impair the prestige of the Government.The regulation of Greek shipping, and the closely related question of the Greek food supply in the future, is under discussion.SERBIA.The Serbian Government has made a request to the Allied Governments for 7,500,000 francs for clothing and other expenditure for the 11.0,000 Serbian prisoners-in Germany and Austria.
NETHERLANDS.A. damaged German torpedo boat lias, come into Ymuiden and its detention lias been demanded, also the internment of wounded taken ashore.A ration of 15,000Aoranges per annum is to be allowed into the Netherlands from Italy.The North Sea Freights Regulation is to be put into force on 29th January, and no Dutch boat is to be allowed to load coal unless she brings a return cargo into an&apos; Allied port.SWEDEN.    -Strong representations have been made to the Government on the subject of the minefield in the Kogrund&apos;s passage, which prevents British vessels from making use of Swedish territorial waters in the Sound and Baltic, and so detaining them there.Railway transit to Russia is heavily congested.NORWAY.Efforts have been made to secure the settlement of several outstanding questions, especially the breaches of the agreements about the export of fish and copper pyrites to Germany. These disputes have been the subject of considerable political controversy, and the occasion of a press attack upon Sir M. Findlay, inspired by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The British Minister suspects that a commercial political arrangement with Germany is being or has been negotiated. Copper pyrites is the chief obstacle to a settlement, and the Norwegian Government wish to export what they call a small quantity (40,000 to 50,000 tons) to Germany. They have been unequivocably informed both in London and in Christiania that this was impossible ; that copper pyrites are just the material Germany is short of to make propellant powder ; and that there can be no compromise on this question.The Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs has made a suggestion that the Norwegian Resolutions as to submarines should be modified so as to allow commercial submarines within territorial waters.DENMARK.Various trade arrangements have been concluded. The total export offish to belligerent countries has been limited under an agreement already concluded. The desiderata of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to other commodities have been stated. Regulations have been made under the existing coal agreement so that no British coal can be used, even indirectly, to make goods for enemy countries. Regulations as to Danish shipping have been settled with the Danish delegates. in England.SPAIN.The Spanish Government has xu&quot;otested against the prohibition of the export of English coal to Spain in any but Spanish ships.A bomb has been found in a British iron ore ship.PORTUGAL.Seven transports containing troops are ready to leave, but complete arrangements as to their escorts have not yet been made.CHINA.The British, Russian and Japanese Ministers have supported the French representative in his effort to secure settlement of the Laohsikai incident on the basis of agreement arrived at in November 1916.b
GJAPAN.The Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked Sir C. Greene to obtain from His Majesty&apos;s Government ail assurance of their willingness to support Japanese claims in respect of Germany&apos;s rights in Shantung and the German islands north of the Equator. This assurance would not be made public. He stated that with this assurance he would find it easier to overcome any opposition that exists in Japan to satisfying the desire expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government for naval assistance. Sir C. Greene favours the giving of this assurance.The Japanese Government disclaimed any intention of pursuing a policy of active interference in. China, or of asserting any special rights in China except in Manchuria and Mongolia, where a privileged situation is claimed.   (Nos. 57 (R) and 63 (R).)His Majesty&apos;s Government have consulted Sir C. Greene as to how far additions to the import duties on certain goods into India, or to the list of goods which may not be imported into the United Kingdom, can be made without giving offence to Japanese opinion. - Sir C. Greene has replied (Nos. 54- and 56) that there would be no dissatisfaction unless the raising of Indian duties involved a preference to the United Kingdom, but deprecated the prohibition of hosiery imports from Japan to the United Kingdom.The Japanese Government is being sounded about the employment of Japanese labour in France.Parliament was dissolved on 25th January, but before separating it passed unanimous resolutions of sympathy with Allies.ARGENTINA.The British Minister at Buenos Aires reports that it is possible that the Argentine Government might prohibit wheat exports if real economic necessity arose in the future.CHILE.The escape of German naval prisoners from the Dresden has been brought to the attention of the Chilean Government.BRAZIL.The possibility of finding some way of inducing the Brazilian Government to requisition German vessels in Brazilian ports is being discussed between- the Foreign Office and the British Minister at Rio de Janeiro. His Majesty&apos;s Government have informed the French and Italian Governments that they will undertake all negotiations for securing enemy tonnage in neutral ports.PERU.The enrolment of British subjects for military service is proceeding.MEXICO.The new constitution to be introduced by Carranza is reported to menace every foreign industry, and especially the oil industry, Avith virtual confiscation ; but the British representative has been entrusted not to make any protest against contemplated legislation at present,- but to assist oil producers in the efforts to induce the Mexican Government to consult them.The United States troops are being withdrawn fast.UNITED STATES.The American Secretary of the Treasury lias&apos; informed&apos; Sir R. Crawford, that he would like to have timely intimation of prospective British loans, and that it was
the omission to do this that caused the Federal Reserve Board to make the announce-ment that caused the issue of Treasury Bills in November to fail.   (Nos. 215 and 216.)American financial circles are vexed by our interference with gold shipments from their country.Several German ships are manned and provisioned as if to make a dash to sea.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Sir C. Spring Rice considers the American Presidents speech must be ineffectual because he cannot get the support from the Legislature required to give any effect to it. He would like to&apos; solicit a third term in the character of the World Peace mediator ; that is his real thought. His relations with Germany are evidently close, and we should avoid any burst of indignation which might make them friendly. (Nos. 175 and 189).The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks one of President Wilson&apos;s objects is to establish a claim to take part in the peace conference.
