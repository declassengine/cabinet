SECRET.216APPRECIATION  OP THE ATTACH El)  WESTERN  AND  GENERALREPORT,  No.  25.Canada.Sir AV. Laurie r&apos;s decision, to oppose the Resolution for the extension of the life of Parliament in all probability involves an autumn election. A Coalition, between Sir R. Borden and the conscriptionist Liberals is generally expected. The opposition will practically be confined to Quebec, where it is likely to be intense, and to some of the Labour organisations. In this connection attention is drawn to the Appendix on the attitude of Labour in the Dominions to the war and to conscription in particular.The financial crisis over the Canadian munitions purchases, though apparently temporarily adjusted, raises issues of the most vital importance to Canada and the Empire. Por Canada the question is whether she is prepared to sacrifice great industrial opportunities for the sake of her dollar exchange with New York. For the Empire the question is whether it prefers, at the end of the war, to have as much as possible of its debts within the Empire, at the same time keeping within the Empire the industrial plant which will help to repay that debt, or whether it prefers to aggrandize the United States, both as our principal creditor and as an industrial competitor. If there were a single Empire currency the possibility of shutting down Canadian munition works, because the American Treasury will only lend money for purchases made in the United States, could never arise. It is a case for the Banks and Treasuries of the Empire learning to think Imperially.German Affairs.The true significance of Dr. Michaelis&apos;s appointment as Imperial Chancellor has not yet been disclosed. The most probable conjecture is that Bethmann-Hollweg has had to be sacrificed to the opposition which ids attitude and. personality have evoked, in order to enable his policy to be substantially carried through. If so, we shall no doubt see Dr. Michaelis accepting a majority resolution of the Reichstag going as far as possible in the direction of &quot;peace without annexations&quot; without formally endorsing the distasteful phrase. It is quite possible that Dr. Michaelis, like his predecessor, is meant to be used up in the process of further adjusting the crisis^ in order to be succeeded by the new Foreign Secretary, Count Brockdorff Rantzau.A UST lit A -H tl N Or A ft Y.The German Bohemian resolution is a reminder that the Bohemian problem has its Ulster, which is now demanding its &quot; clean cut.&quot; To keep in mind the difficulties of our relatively simple Irish problem, is a useful clue to understanding the tangled complex of super-Irelands which goes by the name of Austria-Hungary.
Holland.The temporary concession with regard to the exit of Dutch traffic through our minefield, may come very opportunely to allay the excitement caused by our capture and sinking of German ships on the Dutch coast. But the Germans can be trusted to make the most of the incident.United States.The Americans, confronted with the immensity of the task before them, more particularly on its financial side, are evidently, for the moment, feeling as if they had &quot; bitten off rather more than they can chew.&quot; Nor have they yet quite got over the stage of wishing to &quot;profiteer&quot; over the war, as is shown by their reluctance to advance money except for goods bought in the United States, and their hankering after the surrender of the British slops now building in American shipyards. They will probably feel very differently once their troops have been in action.L. S. A.19th July 1917.

part   i.-british empire  and  africa.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.The Canadian Government were informed by telegram, dated 12th July, that the President of the Board of Trade would offer no objection to the publication of his statement upon the Cattle Embargo which was given at the Imperial War Conference. In the same telegram the Dominion Ministers were asked for their views as to the form of publishing the discussion and as to the editing which, having regard to the private character of some of the discussion and the Resolution on Meat Supplies, is deemed essential. Meantime, the Dominion Government replied, on the same date (12th July) to the previous telegram on the subject,1 stating that the Brime Minister agreed to the proposals put forward regarding publication in the belief that publicity would, be as full and speedy as possible, and that those parts of the discussion which were not confidential would be issued, to the public. Sir Robert borden considers that though related to the meat supply matter, the cattle embargo discussion was really apart, and involved a separate motion (page 10 of proceedings of fourteenth day).In xeply to the invitation of the British G-overnmeut to nominate a representative1 to confer with the Board of Trade upon the subject of the Empire becoming self-sufficing in meat supplies, the Australian Government have nominated the Commonwealth High Commissioner as their representative.GENERAL.It has been suggested by the Army Council to the Governments of Australia and New Zealand that as the cost of the transport of their forces to the United Kingdom is borne by those Dominions, that they should arrange to finance the cost connected with the conveyance of their troops across the United States or Canada. - The administrative arrangements, it is,; proposed, should be under the control of a British ^officer assisted by Dominion officers. In reply, the New Zealand Government have telegraphed that they do not understand the suggestion, as of the routes suggested they chose that via Panama, and made the necessary arrangements. The Ministers add that they have no intention of sending troops across the United i States or Canada.The Dominion Governments have been informed (16th July) that the new Govern-ment cable between England and Canada via the Azores will be open to traffic this week. It is not intended to make any public announcement regarding this or the fact that the cable has been established by the diversion of one of the German Azores-New York cables to Halifax and also one of the Emden-Azores cables to England. The Canadian Government have been asked to send their telegrams to England by the new cable.CANADA.With regard to the financing of the British purchases of munitions and cheese and other supplies in Canada1 as suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Dominion Prime Minister has replied that, as a result of consultation between the Minister of Finance and Sir 11. Lever, the former considers that if the British Treasury can lodge Canadian Municipal or other high-class securities for the Dominion account, he can issue $50,000,000 additional note circulation over the next three months. To issue unsecured circulation would, it is believed, prejudice the market position of securities and the success of future loans. The present position of Canadian securities on the market is, it is explained, critical on account of their being debarred from the American market since the United States came into the war.   The Minister of Finance has been endeavouring to obtain the agreement of the
United States to the issue of a loan in New York, but though this may he possible later, it is not at present certain. The Canadian Minister has, however, since arrived at Washington, and in an interview with the Secretary of the United States Treasury, the latter favoured the floating of the Bank&apos;s loan in New York, in order to help the exchange situation. But the Minister thinks that the British Govern-ment should urge the United States to allow the use of $25,000,000 to 150,000,000 monthly from proceeds of United States loans to enable the British commitments in Canada to he met. It is pointed out that the balance of trade between Canada and the United States is much in favour of the latter and the New York Exchange is now at a heavy premium in Canada. As to specific expenditure, if the British. Treasury lodge the securities mentioned, the Minister of Finance will issue note circulation to meet purchases of cheese, but the Dominion cannot find funds for the War Office purchases of hay, oats, and flour. As arranged, the Canadian Government will help the Imperial Munitions Board with $25,000,000 a month for July, August, and September, but the balance of requirements should, it is considered, be found from the United States loans to the United Kingdom. Further Bank credits are not possible as this source of supply has been exhausted in arranging for advances to Imperial Munitions Board for June, July, and August.In reply, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has expressed his appreciation of the help regarding the note issue and he offers the following securities for clesposit, viz., Railway Debentures guaranteed by Dominion, Railway Securities guaranteed by Provinces, C.P.R. Preference, Railways guaranteed by C.P.R. and Grand Trunk Railway Debentures. The Chancellor emphasises that it is not possible to use credits received from the United States for Canadian payments and that the British Government are having considerable difficulty in obtaining sufficient money to meet the strictly United States disbursements. Arrangements regarding Canada must therefore be made on the basis of obtaining the necessary funds in the Dominion, though it is hoped the United States will agree to the issue of a Canadian loan in New York. Having regard to the circumstances, the Chancellor of the Exchequer states that the $50,000,000 which it is hoped to raise by the note issue must be pooled and be allocated to the needs that are most urgent rather than to the cheese purchases alone, as suggested by the Dominion Minister. As to the balance of $41,000,000, the British Government are considering the manner in which this can be most easily economised.On account of adverse exchange conditions, it may become necessary for the Canadian Government to prohibit the importation of certain non-essentials. By the Convention with France of 1907 the rates of Custom duties upon velvets, silks, wines, &amp;c, were fixed and cannot be increased without the agreement of the French Government. The Dominion Government have therefore requested the British authorities to ask the French Government if they would agree to a partial or total prohibition of goods of the nature- indicated. In this event, the French Government will be approached officially.During the further consideration of the Military Service Bill in the Dominion House of Commons, the Solicitor-General (Mr. Arthur Meighen) moved an addition to the Bill in order to meet the threatened anti-conscription agitation on the Bill becoming law. &apos; One clause of the amendment declared that a person who writes or speaks advocating that any man liable to conscription should disobey or fail to comply with all or any of the requirements imposed hy the Act, or who influences any body or class of persons to resist or impede the due execution of the Act in any respect, shall be liable upon indictment to imprisonment for from one to five years. A further clause stated that anybody who writes or publishes in anynewspaper or pamphlet anything having in view similar objects as outlined in the preceding paragraph, shall be similarly liable to imprisonment, while the newspaper itself shall be summarily suppressed for the duration of war. The amendment actually adopted by the House involved some re-drafting of the above proposals and authority was given to the Central Appeal Judge to consider the question of the suppression of newspapers which counsel young men to disobey the call to the Colours. Another amendment proposed by the Solicitor-General, to which the House agreed, was a more severe penalty for failure to report to the local tribunal when called up. The penalty is now made five 3Tears&apos; imprisonment with hard labour, instead of three years as before. Several Liberal Members criticised the proposed penalties for any agitation to prevent the enforcement of. conscription, stating that the wording of the new section -would make it a criminal offence, punishable by three years&apos; imprisonment, for
anybody to criticise even the manner in which the Act was administered by the Government. In reply, however, the Government stated that it was not the intention to prevent criticism, but merely to prevent, as well as punish, any deliberate attempt to disobey or nullify the Act. The Government have adopted a new grouping of the classes to be called up. The first three classes are to be united into one class consisting of all unmarried men and childless widowers between 20 and 31. Another amendment places upon conscientious objectors the onus of proving that they belonged to a religious body, prior to 6th June, which prohibits its members from engaging in combatant service.A, caucus of the 26 Liberals who voted for conscription was held on 16th July for the purpose of organising under new leadership, and discussing the question of a coalition with Sir It. Borden. Mr. Pardee, the Chief Liberal Whip, was elected chairman.The Resolution providing for the extension of the life of Parliament for a year was moved in the Dominion House of Commons by Sir R. Borden on the 17th July. The Prime Minister stated that the reasons for an extension were now stronger than they were a year ago when the Resolution was passed unanimously, and an election would involve division and dissipation of energy. But he said that if the motion was not carried with practical unanimity, it would not be pressed, and the Govern-men-t woidd appeal to the country. Mr. George Graham (formerly Liberal Minister of Railways and a supporter of conscription) opposed the Resolution until the Govern-ment had fully mobilised the natural resources of Canada for war purposes, while Sir Wilfred Laurier also spoke against it and, in supporting the demand for a General Election, declared that a new mandate and a new Parliament were required. Air. Pardee (Chief Liberal AVhip) said that though the formation of a National Government would be preferable to a General Election such a course was impracticable. The motion was ultimately carried by 82 votes to 62, the majority iuciucling six Liberals and the minority six Conservatives.NEWFOUNDLAND.As it is proposed to form a National Government in the Colony, the Prime Minister wishes to increase the number of the Executive Council from nine to twelve during the period of the war. The arrangements in contemplation involve an equal representation in the Executive Council and an equal share in the Government Departments, the elections being deferred till some time in 1918. Sir E. Morris therefore proposes to resign as Prime Minister, in which case he will be asked to form a new administration on the lines indicated.The Governor reports (12th July) that there are 400 soldiers and foresters awaiting transport, and as the Canadian Government have no accommodation available, enquiry is made as to whether the Admiralty can furnish facilities on board an auxiliary cruiser.   -The Newfoundland Government desire to know if the British Government wish to be provided with more drifters and trawlers such as are now being built in Canada, as suggestions have been made for the building of such vessels in Newfoundland.The Prime Minister has suggested that as the supply of fish is important to Italy and Greece, and no vessels are otherwise available for transport purposes, the Governments of those countries might be approached with a view to their releasing vessels to call at St. Johns for cargoes.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The second session of the Seventh Commonwealth Parliament was opened on 11th July. In his speech the Governor-General said that Members had been called together early in the financial year to consider matters of urgent importance in relation to the successful prosecution of the war and the best direction of the resources of Australia for that purpose. After referring to the fact that the country had declared by a small majority against compulsory service, and that Ministers had given earnest consideration to the question of recruiting by voluntary means in order to maintain the Australian Divisions up to. their full strength, the Governor-General announced that a Federal Recruiting Committee,- consisting of Members of both, parties in the Federal Parliament, had been appointed to assist the Director-General of Recruiting in organising a recruiting effort throughout the Commonwealth.   Regarding the repatriation of returned soldiers, the Government3441 -3 TJ
had determined to appoint a Minister and create a Department of State to deal with the matter, while amendments would be proposed in the Commonwealth Public Service Act to facilitate the employment of returned soldiers in the Public Service. Reference was also made in the speech to the decision of the Government to pursue the policy of raising in Australia the loans required for carrying on the war, and to establish on a permanent basis the provisionally appointed Advisory Council of scientific experts, in order to make available the best and latest results of investigation and research, with a view to increased production. An extensive programme of shipbuilding was also referred to as in preparation by Ministers.In the House of Representatives on .12th duly a long discussion was expected on the Address in Reply, but Mr. Tudor, the Leader of the Opposition, in rising to continue the debate, merely said, that he desired to give the Government an opportunity to make their platform professions good regarding winning the war. The motion, for the Address in Reply was then carried.A Conference of Trade Unions convened by Mr. Hughes to consider the Govern-ment&apos;s shipbuilding proposals, which include provisions for continuity of employment, dilution of labour and piece-work, has agreed to recommend them to the Unions for adoption. Idle replies from the Unions are expected in about three weeks.. Mr. Hughes has expressed his satisfaction at the course taken. Subsequently (loth duly) the Prime Minister held conferences with representatives of the States, and an entire agreement was reached regarding shipbuilding. The State Ministries undertook to co-operate at once with the Commonwealth in laying down as many keels as material and labour could furnish, provided the labour organisations accepted the Commonwealth proposals.Idie Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has announced, that the British Government have bought this season&apos;s wool-clip on the same terms as that of last season, viz., Is. S^d. per lb., plus 50 per cent, of the profits on any wool sold for other than military purposes.With regard to trading permits in the captured .territory1 in the Pacific, the Commonwealth Government state that they do not know of any difference in treatment extended to British and Japanese traders in the islands held at present by the Australian Forces. The Government add that they only ask for the same trading advantages to be given to British subjects in the islands occupied by Japan, and they are -willing to grant reciprocal facilities to the Japanese trading in the islands occupied by Australia.In reply to the Army Council regarding the transport of horses to Mesopotamia2, the Commonwealth Government state that all Australian ships suitable for the purpose have been released to the British Government. About 30 vessels would be required for 17,000 horses and it is pointed out that, with a few exceptions, none of those available would be suitable. In any case all ships are wanted for the transport of metals, wheat, &amp;c.The War Office state that if the Commonwealth Government can-send the-Italian reservists3 by an Australian transport to the United Kingdom, they will arrange for the further journey to Italy through France. The Military Authorities suggest, however, that not more than 700 reservists should be sent in any single convoy in order to prevent the transport of too large a number across If ranee at any one period.The Premier of South Australia (Mr.&apos; Vaughan) has resigned as a result of a defeat in the House by 23 votes to 18, on a motion launched by Mr. Peake. The latter has now formed a new Ministry, which is purely Biberal in character, as there was a break-down in the negotiations between, the Ministerialist and Liberal Parties for the formation of a National Government. The Governor has approved of Mr. Peake&apos;s Ministry.The Secretary of State has informed the Commonwealth G-overnment that the matter of the supply of tinplates1 is being dealt with in consultation with the Ministry of Munitions. Meantime, however, he states that as all the stocks have been commandeered, the difficulty is not one of price, but of materials.The Governor-General reports for the month of June that the number of troops despatched as reinforcements amount to 11-1 officers and 5,592 other ranks, while those undergoing training number 239 officers and 16,105 other ranks.1 See Western and General Report for week ending 27th June 1917. 2 See &quot;Western and General Report for week ending 4th July 1917. 3 See &quot;Western and General Report for week ending
The Australian Government have been asked to supply particulars of the annul-in en t of enemy contracts1 in the Commonwealth, as it&apos; is necessarj7 to ascertain the extent of foreign interests affected in connection with the interference by the enemy with contracts in which British subjects are interested.NEW ZEALAND.With regard to the protest against the reported requisitioning of the &quot; Corinthic,&quot; the Shipping Controller has informed the Dominion Government2 that this vessel was requisitioned under the general scheme of 13th June and is transporting troops to South Africa from the United Kingdom. It is pointed out, however, that the ship is not being withdrawn from the New Zealand trade, for she is being sentin ballast in order to facilitate coaling in New Zealand. The Controller wishes to learn the source of the New Zealand Ministers information as to the withdrawal of the ship, for the movements of a vessel of this character should be considered as confidential. In giving particulars concerning the use to which other vessels are being put, the Shipping Controller remarks that it is not possible to consider that specific ships - are attached to New Zealand trade. Unless losses on account of submarines necessitate an alteration, it is intended that 10 ships, to which attention has been directed, shall load meat entirely in New Zealand during September. Generally, the assurance given to the Dominion Prime Minister is repeated, that all measures will be adopted to relieve the difficult situation in New Zealand, but this is subject to the urgent needs of the United Kingdom. In view of the present shipping position, it is not expected that any permanent extension of facilities can take place until the tonnage lost can be adequately replaced.The Dominion Government have been asked for their reasons for refusing the necessary visa to the Mormon missionaries,3 as it is stated in the United States that the decision will interrupt the work of many years.SOUTH AFRICA.It is reported that General Botha has been ordered two months&apos; complete rest by his medical advisers. During this time Mr. Malan will act for the Prime Minister, Colonel Mentz will take charge of the Ministry of Defence, and Sir Jacobus de Graaf will act as Minister for Native Affairs.At the Orange Free State Provincial Congress of the South African Party held this month, a Resolution was passed approving the Governments war policy and expressing a hope that every endeavour would be made to retain German South-West Africa as part of the Union. The Resolution also advocated a contribution of 1,000,OOOZ. towards the British Fleet in view of its immense value in maintaining South Africa&apos;s oversea commerce, and recorded deep appreciation of General Smuts&apos; commandership in East Africa and his participation in the War Cabinet.With reference to the telegram from the Union Government relating to the admission of Japanese2 to the Union, the Secretary of State has asked the South African Government for particulars of the present practice of issuing temporary permits to British Indians. He points out that there would be objections to granting more favourable terms to the Japanese.RHODESIA.The Commandant-General reports that the rifles for which the Rhodesian Native Units have been waiting4 have now arrived, and that the musketry training has begun.The Army Council state that when the necessary ships are available, two companies of the Second Rhodesian Regiment may be sent to England and the other companies may follow soon afterwards. As far as possible, the Rhodes!ans will he kept in separate companies.1 A similar telegram has been sent to New Zealand. 2 See Western and General Report for week ending 4th july  1917. 3 See Western and General Report for week ending 12th June 1917. 4 See Western and General Report for week ending 11th July 1917.
PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.The Portuguese Government, being anxious to meet the wishes of the British Government, regarding the recruitment of carriers,1 have decided that, although they are themselves short of carriers and they fear that recruiting may lead to native trouble, they will grant all facilities to the British recruiting authorities. The British Consul at Lorenzo Marques telegraphs that, in order to secure the carriers, the area for recruiting should be the whole of the province north of latitude 22&quot; south but he apprehends that an attempt will be made to curtail the recruiting area. The Consul states that the Governor-General is unable to speak definitely about the procedure and areas for recruiting until he has received further instructions from Lisbon.PART II. FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ALLIED COMMON AFFAIRS.On 18th July the Allies were informed that the United States Government do not desire to take part in the forthcoming Conference at Paris.BELGIUM.On the 15th Sir F. Villiers reported that several important changes were about to take place in the Belgian Cabinet. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had announced his intention of resigning on grounds of ill &quot;health, and Baron de Broqueville had been named as his successor. Several other Ministers were about to retire; but these changes were due to internal causes and not to any differences in regard either to. foreign policy or to continuance of the war. .A German official wireless of 12th July gives what purports to be an account of a performance held at the Alhambra Theatre in Brussels on the 10th, where before an audience of 3,000, the Flemish poet Rene Clerq delivered a speech exhorting the Flemish people to fight for the independence of Flanders, under Flemish leaders. The occasion thus celebrated was the anniversary of the Battle of the Golden. Spurs fought at Kortrijk (Courtrai) in 1302, when the French were defeated and Flanders liberated from their yoke.On behalf of the Relief Commission, the French Ambassador in London has proposed that the Commission should be allowed to purchase and bring forward certain cargoes of foodstuffs, now on board Dutch ships detained in United States ports. His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed to this arrangement, provided that the purchases are completed before the ships are given clearance.GREECE.On 13th July Mr. Crackanthorpe reported that a serious difference of opinion had arisen between King Alexander and M. Venizelos concerning His Majesty&apos;s constitu-tional position. The difference arose out of the King&apos;s unwillingness to include the expression of certain political views, as suggested by the Prime Minister, in a telegram of congratulation to the King of Serbia on his birthday. Briefly stated, the King&apos;s line of argument in this matter made it appear that he did not regard himself as King, but only as locum tenens for his father ; M. Venizelos declined to serve as Prime Minister if such were the case. He proposes to bring the question to a definite issue by including in the speech from the Throne (to be delivered at the opening of the Chamber on the 25th) certain clear statements as to King Constantine&apos;s final abdication and King Alexanders succession. In the event of His Majesty&apos;s declining to accept this speech, AI. Venizelos foresees that it may be necessary to replace him by Prince Paul and a Regency. It would seem, however, as if the Prime Ministers firm attitude had produced the desired effect, for on 14th July His Majesty addressed a congratulatory telegram to the President of the French Republic, in which he expressed his &quot; sincere good wishes for the triumph, of right, justice and liberty, for &quot; which France for the past three years has been waging an heroic struggle, in which &quot; Greece is happy to be able henceforward to bear her part.&quot;
In last week&apos;s- Report it was recorded that, in. the opinion of the &quot;French Govern-ment, the time had come to abolish the Allied controls, as a form of surveillance no longer justified by the facts of the situation. This opinion was conveyed by Lord Bertie to His Majesty&apos;s Government on 10th July; on the same day, however, the Chiefs of the Allied controls met at Athens to discuss the Greek Government^ demand for their abolition. The French Naval Attache, Chief of the Posts and Telegraphs control, proposed, that it should be maintained under a changed title and-with a Greek officer attached. It was agreed that the controls should not be abolished without orders from the Governments concerned, and various proposals were made for their maintenance, under conditions modified so as to combine efficiency with reasonable concessions to Greek amour propre. M. Clausse, supporting the views of the French Naval Attache, informed Mr. Crackanthorpe on the 11th that be was advising the French Government in the sense that the Allied representatives should be authorised to conclude with the Greek Government temporary arrangements for the working of their several controls, pending their final abolition. Mr. Crackan-tborpe is in favour of this provisional solution.Describing the steps being taken for the reorganisation of the Greek Army, a Report by the British. Military Attache at Athens states that owing to the limited capacity of the Hellenic railways it will take 20 days to withdraw the French troops from Old Greece, at the rate of four trains a clay. The removal of the Greek Army from Morea will begin about 26th July, when rolling stock becomes available. The classes of 1916 and 1917 will be called up in a month or six weeks ; they should each xu-provide 20,000 recruits. The French Military Attache and other officers will render assistance in the work of reorganisation, which is &quot;seriously handicapped by the fact that it has been necessary to remove many staff officers and others on account of their pro-German, proclivities. With regard to the difficulties of railway transport, the Greek Government have urgently requested that steps should be taken to expedite the shipment from England of railway material and supplies, contracted for but long held up by reason of: the blockade.On 18th July M. Venizelos informed Mr. Crackanthorpe that he had received from the French Government an official notification that the Greek ships in the French service would now be. restored to the Greek Navy.According to a report by the French Military Attache at Athens (not always a reliable source of information) a considerable amount of active discontent exists among Royalists and reservists. The postal censorship shows that many of them are apparently prepared to take to the mountains rather than be mobilised. The numerous changes and. removals of minor officials have created much irritation. There is agitation in Peloponnese, but not serious enough to lead to open revolt; and. something in the nature of an arm eel. concentration in the region of Eytanie.The arrangements for the evacuation of Greek territory by the Italian and French forces respectively have not been completed as rapidly as might have been expected from the facts of the situation as stated in last week&apos;s Report. The date of joint evacuation had been fixed for the 20th, but a hitch arose over the proposed retention of certain Italian units in an angle of territory where stations have been, established for the protection of the Santa Quaranta road. As a result of urgent representations by M. Venizelos, the Italian Minister at Athens advised his Government on the 11th to sanction, the reinstatement of the Greek authorities in this district, but in conversa-tion with M. Clausse he expressed the opinion that his Government would not give their consent. Pending a settlement of the Italian difficulty, the French agreed with M. Venizelos on the 15th that they would evacuate Piraeus, Athens, and the Gulf of Corinth before the 23rd, but would remain for the present at Larissa. They were prepared, if asked, to evacuate Thessaly completely, but M. Venizelos was in doubt as to the advisability or pressing them to do so, before we had come to an arrangement with the Italians. Eventually he decided to request the Italian Minister to carry out the original joint evacuation agreement, leaving the Epirus angle question for settle-ment hereafter. Should the Italians prove obdurate about reinstating the Greek authorities, the Prime Minister will lay the case before the Allied Powers, and appeal against this unj ustifiable encroachment on Greek territory. On 12th July, His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Corfu reported that the Italians were establishing a military convalescent camp there, with accommodation for 1,500 patients.On the 14-th of July M. Venizelos and other members of the Greek Government deposited wreaths on the graves of the British and French seamen who fell at Athens d.uring the disturbances of 1st December.   Mr. Crackanthorpe suggests that steps3^41-3 O
shorncl he taken to enclose the ground, in which these 10 British seamen are buried, and to erect tombstones to their memory.The French national festival was celebrated at Athens with the greatest enthusiasm, and M. Venizelos met with a great reception. A French military review was held at the Stadium and there were appropriate performances in honour of France at all the theatres.SERBIA.Sir C. des Graz reports (12th July) that the Serbian Government have decided- to move from Corfu to Salonika.A conference has recently been held at Corfu between Jugoslav representatives and the the Serbian Government to discuss matters of common interest and policy. To the Russian Governments sympathetic greetings the leaders of this conference have replied, stating that theis proceedings have been cordially unanimous and in complete accord with the views of the Russian Government. A note on the &quot;result ef the conference will shortly be published.GERMAN AFFAIRS.The &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; of 11th July, describing the momentous Crown Council convened by the Kaiser, to discuss Electoral Reform, gave a frank resume of the critical situation. It confessed that the big industrial, landed and shipping interests represented by &quot;the National-Liberal party were solidly determined to oppose reforms which must diminish their class privileges. The Centre, the Social Democrats and the Peophts Progressive Barty were equally determined to secure Electoral Reform and a declaration in favour of peace without annexations. Therefore, said the &quot;Tageblatt,&quot; the Governments only path of safety lay in the immediate introduction of radical changes. The emperor&apos;s Decree, granting an alteration of the Electoral law on the basis of equal franchise, was issued the same evening. On the following day the &quot; Tageblatt,&quot; criticising the vague promises of the Imperial proclamation, declared that the whole ten our of this very unsatisfactory document was a testimonial to the KaiseFs unshaken confidence in Bethmann-PIolIweg. It explained that the Chancellor had tendered his resignation, not as Chancellor, but as Prussian Premier. On the 13th, the &quot; Bavarian Courier &quot; published a sensational letter, describing an interview with the Chancellor, in which he was alleged to have identified his peace policy with that of David and Scheidemann, and declared that the Empire&apos;s greatest danger comes from those Germans who continue to believe in the possibility of Germany being victorious. On the 13th, Hinclenburg and Ludendorff were summoned to Berlin, where the Crown Prince was already busily engaged in discussing the vote of credit impasse with all sorts and conditions of politicians, from the Conservative Count Westarp to Erzberger and David. From this point, the situation developed rapidly. On two questions the Press and political opinion were sharply divided, viz.: (1) the establishment of responsible Ministries, upon the Parliamentary system, for the Empire, and (2) &quot; peace without annexations.&quot; Stalwarts, like the &quot; Bavarian Staats Zeitung&quot; continued to assert in the words of Bismarck that &quot; a restoration of &quot; the parliamentary regime must surely lead to the ruin and re-disintegration of the &quot; German Empire.&quot; But it was upon the question of &quot;peace without annexations&quot; that the Emperor, &quot;with a heavy heart&quot; was eventually constrained to accept the resignation of his faithful Chancellor. According to the most authoritative sources of information, the Kaiser supported the Crown Prince and his military advisers in declining to make the declaration upon which Austria, Bavaria and the majority of the Reichstag insisted and still insist. Bethmaim PIollweg&apos;s resignation, tendered on the 11th, was accepted after his Conference with the Crown Prince on the 13th. The appointment of Herr Michaelis to succeed him was generally welcomed by the Conservative and Junker Press. The &quot; Kreuz Zeitung &quot; described him as &quot;rooted in the best traditions of Prussian officialdom.&quot; The &quot; Berliner Tageblatt,&quot; though less enthusiastic, commended his great firmness and energy. The &quot; Vorwarts &quot; said he possessed the confidence of the people and had no enemies outside the Agrarian party. Altogether a dark horse, but one whose appearance was hardly calculated to encourage optimism in Vienna at the outset. Opinions, however, are by no means unanimous as to his politics and proclivities. Mr. von Wiegaud, the American correspondent lately in Germany, regards his appointment as a compromise.   As a
strong man lie satisfies the J tinkers, but he won the sympathy of the Socialists by working closely with them as Prussian Food Dictator, and he will be supported by the bourgeoisie, because he is of the people. Mr. von &quot;Wiegand believes he must be in favour of electoral reform and peace without annexations. Mr. Branting does not share these views ; he considers Herr Michaelis as a representative of the reactionaries and anticipates an early split between him and the parties of the Left.According to information emanating from Austrian official sources, the appoint-ment of Herr xMichaelis is merely temporary, the Chancellorship being eventually destined to be filled by Count Brockdorff Rantzau, now transferred from the&apos;Legation at Copenhagen to be Foreign Secretary. Count Rantzau is variously described as a brutal and unscrupulous Prussian (this from the Austrian sources above-mentioned) and. by Sir R. Paget as a man of moderate and reasonable views who, as Minister at Copenhagen, stood between the Danes and German aggression. Sir W. Townley regards his appointment and alleged prospects of promotion to&apos; the Chancellorship as proof that the reactionary and military elements have carried the day at Berlin. In confirmation of this view he observes that the leaders of the political parties in the Reichstag were not consulted by the Kaiser in regard to the nomination either of the new Chancellor or the Foreign Secretary. He also observes (July .18th) that Austrian opposition to Count Rantzau as Foreign Secretary is very strong.Information received on the subject of Germany&apos;s food supplies and harvest prospects goes to show that at the beginning of. July there was a shortage of 600,000 tons in the amount of wheat required to maintain the present reduced bread ration to the 16th of August, when the new supplies begin to come upon the market. The general condition of the crops is bad, except in Western Germany.By an order of the Imperial Clothing Department, the use of serviettes has been forbidden in places of public refreshment. The washing of table-cloths will be prohibited from the 1st of October. Other regulations restrict the use of towels and bed linen in hotels and inns.AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.A. German official Avireless of 17th July reproduces a message from Prague&apos; referring to the Resolution unanimously adopted by a full assembly of the German National Council. In this Resolution the elected representatives of German Bohemia declared their strong feelings of distrust towards the present Government on account of its attitude towards the Czechs, and especially on account of the amnesty decree. The Resolution further demanded the creation of a defined administrative region, to be known as the Province of German Bohemia, having its own Diet, claiming for this province full rights of self-government within a unitary Austrian State, in which State German should be the official language.A neutral diplomatist in Vienna is reported (6th July) as describing the effect of the Russian offensive to have been a complete surprise and a heavy blow for the Austrians. They have no effective reserves, he says, wherewith to replace these latest losses, and are preparing to evacuate Lemberg and a large tract of territory. The Turks he describes as demoralised and the Bulgarians as utterly war-weary. The Chief of the Austrian General Staff, Von Arz, is at loggerheads with Hindenburg, and opposed to his policy of &quot; holding on &quot; in the hope of ultimate victory by means of submarines. According to this authority, the terms upon which Austria is anxious to make peace would, involve the restoration of Belgium, Northern Prance, Roumania and Serbia ; the independence of Poland, and a joint indemnification of Belgium by the Central Powers and the Entente. Conceding these, they would propose to leave all other questions for future discussion.SWITZERLAND.The Swiss Minister in London has conveyed to His Majesty&apos;s Government an expression of the desire of his Government that Great Britain will support their representations at Washington, so as to convince the State Department that there is no leakage of imported goods from Switzerland into Germany, and also that it is a matter of necessity for Switzerland to exchange a certain amount of her own produce for German coal. Lord Robert Cecil informed His Excellency in reply that it would be difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to intervene in a purely American matter without offending American sensitiveness.
The Federal Council met on 11th July to determine a date for opeuing negotiations with Germany for a revision and renewal of the Economic Agreement, It is thought; that Germany may7 decline to bind herself to deliver any fixed monthly quota of coal because of the scarcity of labour in the Belgian mines and the difficulties of transport.,   HOLLAND.In reply to a further message from Her Majesty the Queen of Holland on the subject of- the proposed extension of the British clanger-zone in the North Sea, Idis Majesty King George telegraphed on the 17th July announcing that, as proof of good-will towards Holland and of regard for Her Majesty&apos;s representations and those of the Dutch Government, the Admiralty had decided for the present to leave an area sufficient for the purposes of Dutch shipping between the Western limit of the British danger area and the Eastern limit, as uoav fixed, of Germany&apos;s zone of indiscriminate destruction. This concession has been^macle on the understanding that the Dutch Government have requested the German Government to extend their &quot; safety &quot; zone further to the westward and on the assumption that this request will produce some positive result.With further reference to the &quot;indiscretion&quot; of M. Posthuma, Minister for Agriculture, Sir W. Townley has been instructed to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government accept the assurance that the real meaning of his speech on 1st July was quite different from that which its language conveyed. Inasmuch, however, as this- is the second occasion on which M. Posthuma has had the ill-fortune, without intending it, to arouse resentment against England by making suggestions unjustified by facts, His Majesty&apos;s Government are compelled, in the interest of both countries, to ask the Dutch Government to disavow his utterances on this occasion, so that no further doubt may exist as to their real sentiments in the matter.The mixed Arbitration Commission which is to decide as to the lawfulness of the Dutch authorities&apos; action in interning German submarines, commenced its sittings at the Hague on 12th July. Sir W. Townley learns from, the Editor of the &quot; Telegraaf &quot; that the Manager&apos;of that paper had been told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the Commission would support Germany&apos;s contention in this matter, and that public opinion in Allied countries should be prepared for this result. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in forecasting the probable result of the inquiry, had given Sir W. Townley a totally different impression.A correspondent asks, in the &quot; Nieuwe Rotterdam sche Courant,&quot; why the principle of international arbitration, applied in the case of the interned German submarines, is not equally7 applicable to determine the rights of Dutch complainants against Germans who sink Dutch ships, seize their mails, &amp;c. Editorial comment on this letter places the blame on Great Britain for having opposed the institution of an International. Prize Court. As regards the Commission, now sitting in the case of the German submarines, the official communique to the Press declares that its business is confined to investigation of the facts, the determination of their legal consequences resting, as before, with the Dutch Government alone.Four German merchantmen were captured by British destroyers, and two others beached off Bergen-aan-Zee, on the morning of 16th July. No official account of the incident has yet been received from Holland, but statements have been made in the Press that the Dutch naval authorities are investigating a report to the effect that the British destroyers, in pursuing the German vessels, came within PIolland&apos;s territorial waters. The &quot; Handelsblad,&quot; commenting on the facts as reported, has no hesitation in describing them as &quot; a flagrant violation of Dutch territorial rights against which the Government will not fail to protest.&quot; The &quot;Telegraaf&quot; is practically the only newspaper that does not take this view.SWEDEN.The Swedish Press has recently displayed great uneasiness at the prospect of an intensified blockade by the United &apos; States. All the principal papers repudiate the assertion that Sweden has violated the spirit of neutrality in the matter of her exports, and declare that any attempt on the part of the Allies to compel her to stop all exports to Germany would be tantamount to forcing her to abandon neutrality. Sir E. Howard considers that this argument gains support from certain statements current in the Allied Press (especially in America) that the time has come for Scandinavia to make a definite choice between the belligerents. The Allied Ministers at Stockholm -are considering whether action should be taken to correct these statements and to
enlighten public opinion as to the true nature of the Allies&apos; blockade policy. The United States Minister advocates the sending of some Swedish-American labour-union delegates to Stockholm for tins purpose.The &quot; Stockholms Tidning,&quot; in an article which bears evidence of official inspiration (12th July), declares that the entire country is united in its unswerving determination to maintain Swede.u&apos;s commercial neutrality. It would regard it as an unjust abuse of power if England and America, acting merely on unproven suspicions, were to adopt economic measures injurious to Sweden in these days of trial. Sir E. Howard, discussing the political effect of these opinions, recommends that he and bis American colleague should be authorised to address a communication to the Swedish Government, for piiblication, stating that the Allies do not wish to see Sweden abandon her neutrality, and that the blockade will only be used to prevent imports from Great Britain and America from being used to the advantage of the enemy.Reporting on his recent negotiations for a modus vlvendi, to clear off the large quantity of transit goods (some 85,000 tons) detained in Sweden, Sir E. Howard observed on the 1 2th that he saw no prospect of persuading the Swedish Government to accede to the proposal that they should give free transit in return for cereal cargoes. He enquires therefore whether he may continue to negotiate on the basis that Sweden shall be allowed to retain a proportion of the goods in transit, on allowing the remainder to go forward.According to reliable information, the present position of foocf supplies in Scandinavia and Holland is such that, with the cargoes now on the way, they are fully provided for, up to the gathering of their harvests.NORWAY.In the case of the S.S. &quot; Thorunn &quot; (vide Report No. 23), the sentence of fine imposed on her master and mate has been confirmed by Prince Henry &quot;for resisting German guards after capture.&quot; The vessel is to be Prize-courted because of this resistance, the Norwegian Government having declined to make the declaration (required by Germany for her release) that their Naval Officer was wrong in stopping the ship and ordering the German flag to be struck. Norway&apos;s claim is that the capture was illegal, having been made within the 3-mile limit.His Majesty!s Minister at Christiania has drawn attention to the increasing scarcity of copper in Norway and has suggested that the moment might be opportune, for the Allies to make an agreement to supply the Norwegians with the copper wire, tin and antimony they require for local consumption, in return for an undertaking to cease from exporting copper, pyrites, and a number of other metals to enemy countries. Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to consult the United States Government in this matter and (noting that copper and other non-ferrous metals do not come within their list of prohibited exports) to ask whether Great Britain can rely upon effective American support in endeavouring to put a stop to these Norwegian exports in the manner suggested by Sir M. Findlay.On 11th July two German agents, named Wilson and Bergmann, were arrested by the Norwegian, police at Kirkenes ; their business was the planting of bombs on vessels in Norwegian and Russian waters. The attention of His Majesty&apos;s Minister has been drawn by the Foreign Office to the very large increase which has recently been noted iri the number of alarm clocks imported into Norway.DENMARK.There is great scarcity of grass in Denmark, so that farmers are obliged to sell their beasts.    On 1.2th Juby 4,000 head were offered for sale in Copenhagen market.Sir R. Paget learns that the Danish Government have received assurances that, if lubricants are not forthcoming from the United States, Germany will make efforts to supply them in quantity sufficient to meet the needs of Denmark and Sweden. Two railway wagon ioads were recently delivered at Esbjerg for the use of Danish fishermen.3441-3 D
Writing on 19th June, Sir A. Hardinge forwards a Report by His Majesty&apos;s Military Attache in Madrid on the subject of the movement among the officers of the Spanish Army. The &quot;Juntas&quot; were then bent on securing the removal from their military office of two ex-Ministers for War (those of the Dato and Romanones Cabinets) as well as that of His Majesty&apos;s Master of the Horse, the Marquis of Viana. The mot cTordre has been issued that the military crisis was satisfactorily ended, and. there had been a loyal counter-demonstration at the Opera House; nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador fears that the personal popularity and authority of the King have been affected by recent events.On 14th July Sir A. Hardinge reported an unconfirmed rumour (stated to have originated with Count Romanones) to the effect that pro-German intriguers, backed by certain of the recently dismissed Court officials, were urging the King to allow the re-opening of the Cortes for the discussion&apos;of the Catalan question, on the pretext of avoiding bloodshed at Barcelona. The alleged purpose of this plot is to secure the return of the Democrats to office, under the direction of Alba, the friend of Germany. At the same time, another rumour was in circulation (reported to the French Em bassy by the French Consul at Barcelona), namely, that the Army had been officially warned from Madrid that the British Government were spending money for the purpose of fomenting the Catalan and other revolutionary movements in Spain.There would seem to be good, reason for anticipating disturbances at Barcelona. The Prime Minister&apos;s reply to the leaders of the Catalan movement gives fair warning of the Governments intention to prevent, by force if necessary, the convening of any such unconstitutional assembly as the Parliamentarists propose to hold on 19th July. The Government have declared the threatened attempt to hold that meeting to be sedition, punishable by law. On the 15th, the Captain General commanding the troops at Barcelona authorised the publication of a manifesto declaring that the Army would not join in any revolutionary movement. On the 17th, a force of 30,000 troops had been concentrated in and about the city and there were four Spanish warships in the harbour. The Catalans had originally threatened to call out the old local militia, but on the 17th all was quiet and their leaders were professedly anxious to avoid disturbances. Their idea was to hold their meeting as briefly as possible, to denounce the Government and demand a constitutional assembly, without reference either to revolution or Republic. If the meeting were prevented or the Parliamentarists arrested-, their next move would be to declare a general strike, beginning with railways, at the end of the month. But anarchists and German-paid revolutionaries were at work, distributing seditious literature amongst the workmen, and the people of Barcelona have ever been inflammable material.Sir A. Hardinge reported on the 18th that the Spanish Ambassador, expected to reach London on that day, is authorised and prepared to renew negotiations and. to conclude an arrangement with Great Britain on lines practically identical, with those of the Cortina agreement.PORTUGAL.Sir L. Carnegie reports that the recent disturbances and bloodshed in Lisbon arose out of a builders&apos; strike, in dealing with which the police and troops appear to have acted with unnecessary violence. A large number of casualties and arrests have taken place. On the 1.7th the city was expecting the declaration of a general strike, but information was hard to obtain as the publication of newspapers was suspended.CHINA.Idie intelligent anticipations of the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs concerning the settlement of the Chinese crisis have been remarkably justified by events. On 1.1th July he expressed complete confidence in the ability of Tuan Chi-jui (aided by General Feng as the new President) to emerge from the struggle with prestige and authority, sufficient to enable him to hold his own ; he might then be relied on to carry out his policy of declaring war on Germany, without asking the Allies to make any specific bargain with him for so doing. His Excellency did not anticipate any organised movement of opposition in&apos; the South. Incidentally, he observed that the appointment of Wang Ta-hsieh to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs Avould greatly strengthen the new Chinese Government. On the 15th (hostilities having ceased at Peking on the 12th) Tuan Chi-jui informed the French Minister,
on behalf of the Allied representatives, that as soon as President Feng had arrived at Peking and the Cabinet assumed office he would communicate to the Allies his CfovernmenPs decision regarding China&apos;s declaration of war. He also announced the impending appointment of Wang Ta-hsieh as Foreign Minister. The Cabinet will consist entirely of Tuan&apos;s supporters and its composition is likely to be regarded as satisfactory in Tokio. Tuan Chi-jui officially resumed the Premiership on 5th July, by virtue of a mandate from President Li. On the 15th he became also Minister for War. Wang Ta-hsieh assumed office as Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 1.6th. The question of the Presidency is still unsettled. General Feng became Acting President, by the terms of the Constitution, on the 6th. Mr. Alston reported on the 18th, however, that he declines to come to Peking and desires Li Yuan-hung to retain the Presidency. Li has left the refuge of the Japanese Legation and returned to his private residence, but announces his final determination not to resume office.Mr. Alston reported on the 12th that Chang Hsiin, after some slight show of resistance, had fled, and been brought for safety to the Dutch Legation by some German or Austrian friends. At 4 p.m. on that day hostilities ceased, and. Chang Hsun&apos;s troops were induced to surrender upon receipt of three months&apos; pay, the funds being advanced for the purpose by the Japanese Bank. They were disarmed on the I Sth and sent back to their homes by rail. On the loth, Mr. Alston reported on the increasing evidence of Chang Hsun&apos;s connection with the Germans and on the part played by the Dutch Legation in these proceedings. The German Legation guard were brought back to Peking on the 10th from, their place of internment outside the city, and supplied with arms by the Dutch Minister, who also made arrangements for accommodating Chang Hsun in the erstwhile German barracks. After the surrender of Chang&apos;s troops, the Dutch Minister requested that His Majesty&apos;s Legation should take over the custody of his uncomfortable guest; the request was declined on the ground that, having refused Tuan&apos;s terms and engaged in hostilities, Chang Hsun is not necessarily entitled to claim to be treated as a political refugee.JAPAN.Sir 0. Greene gathered, from a conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Tokio on 12th July that the Japanese Government propose to reply to the British GoverumenPs request for assistance in the provision of tonnage for Allied purposes (vide Reports 18 and 23), not by allocating vessels already built, but by undertaking to release vessels in course of construction or about to be laid down, and this on condition that they are supplied with the materials requisite for building them. The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke of allocating 200,000 additional tons of shipping in return for the supply of 600,000 tons of materials, of which 100,000 tons are reqiured for ships no\V building, and the remainder would be spread over a period of about three years. It would not be possible, he said, to divert to the Allies, from the use of Japanese merchants and shippers, any of the already insufficient tonnage.Confirming and supplementing this message on the 16th, His Majesty&apos;s Minister stated that the Japanese Government&apos;.s official note on the subject emphasised the difficulties with which they have to contend, in view of their own shortage cf tonnage on the one hand and the lack of shipbuilding materials on the other. They point out that 37 Japanese ships are at present chartered to foreign countries and 100 or more exported, so that requisitioning for Allied services is impracticable. If the Allies will give definite guarantees for the supply of building materials, Japan will undertake to construct 1,000,000 tons of new shipping during the next three years and to offer the greater portion of it to the Allies, in addition to the 200.000 tons above mentioned of vessels now being built or planned.SIAM.The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir II. Bering in confidence that Siam&apos;s declaration of war against Germany will be delivered at Berlin on 22nd July or on the evening of the 21st. All Austrians and Germans of military age will&apos; thereupon be arrested as prisoners of war. There being some difficulty in arranging for the internment of their families in Australia (vide Report No. 21), the Siamese Government have now requested the Government of India to receive the whole German-Austrian colony for internment, Siam paying the cost of their transport and subsequent maintenance.
ARGENTINA.Concerning the representations addressed to the German Government early in July (vide Report No. 23), Sir R. Tower is informed that, at an interview with the President of the Republic on the 10th, the German Minister explained that Germany could not make an exception by respecting the Argentine flag in her submarine warfare, as &quot; the privilege would be abused by ships of other nations.&quot; The President is reported to have threatened that, unless the desired assurances are given, diplomatic relations will be severed.It having been decided that the American squadron will visit the Argentine, the Government have signified that it will afford them great pleasure &quot;to receive the visit of the sailors of that friendly nation.&quot;BRAZIL.Steps are being taken by the Brazilian Government to repair the damage done to the German ships before their seizure, and arrangements are being made with the British builders of several of these vessels to replace parts of their machinery.The Brazilian Government consider that the stipulation made by the British Government requiring them to ship coffee for England on ex-German ships is derogatory to their national dignity. The coffee question (of no small concern to the Brazilian Government) remains therefore still unsettled.URUGUAY.The arrival of the United States naval squadron at Montevideo &quot;was welcomed with a great demonstration of popular enthusiasm.MEXICO.Mr. Cummins had an unofficial interview with Sehor Carranza on 11th July. The conversation was friendly but argumentative ; eventually, Carranza agreed to restore all British property seized except the railways, in regard to which he contended that the lower employes were in league with rebels. He asserted that the ill-feeling and contempt shown to the British subjects was due, not so much to German propaganda, as to our identification with the United States. The American Government was now creating difficulties for him&apos; in the matter of the loan which had been definitely offered to him in the United States. He wished His Majesty&apos;s Government to under-stand that the more such obstacles were raised, the more foreign interests in Mexico would suffer. He asked only for a fair field and no favour ; but if thwarted and in need, he would seize money wherever he could lay hands on it, no matter to whom it might belong.As to the constitution of the new laws, he declared that they would affect Mexicans and foreigners alike, a statement which Mr. Cummins characterises as.absurd. In this connection he- referred to the arbitrary action of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as displayed in the seizure of the Government-supply ships &quot; Oregon &quot; and &quot;Leonor,&quot; together with the stores and other property of the Mexican Government aboard them. Mr. Cummins suggests (and Sir C. Spring Rice strongly recommends the suggestion) that His Majesty&apos;s Government should now remove all cause for complaint in that matter by lending or giving the two ships in question to the Mexican Government as a friendly act (on condition that they will not be returned to their enemy owners), and to pay for their cargo. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington considers that the seizure of these vessels has had an unfortunate influence on our relations with Mexico, and played into the hands of the Germans.According to latest advices (13th July), the United States Government do not contemplate lending Carranza either money or arms at present. His Majesty&apos;s representative in Mexico considers that, unless stringent conditions are imposed, the .result of giving Carranza a loan of any size would be disastrous.CUBA.The President of the Republic celebrated the 14th of July by suspending the constitutional guarantees, on the ground that the Government have proof that, although the rebellion has been suppressed, the country is full of &quot; moral and. material unrest, fostered in part by the foreign element.&quot; On the 13th, he emphasised the friction existing between himself and Congress by declining to sign the Bill authorising a loan of 30 million dollars, and by vetoing the Bill increasing the salaries of Members of Congress. The Salaries Bill was subsequently passed at a. special session over the presidential veto and is now law.
UNITED   STATES.A telegram from Sir C. Spring Rice on 14th July informed His Majesty&apos;s Government of the serious difficulties with which the United States Government, and especially the Secretary of the Treasury, are confronted with regard to the question of new loans to the Allies. If a further loan should he asked for before the adjournment of Congress, the Government will have to face serious opposition, not only from the Irish, pro-German, Scandinavian and Roman Catholic groups, but from the pacifists and politicians of the Hearst persuasion, who maintain that the country&apos;s resources should be reserved for its own defence. Under these circum-stances, before asking for further advances, the United States Government must be able to justify those already made, by a clear statement that will convince public opinion. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador observes furthermore, that, in return for their assistance, the United States Government will certainly expect to have a voice in matters of military policy and in the discussion of peace terms ; he sees evidence of a tendency on their part to concur in the Russian Governments demands for a relaxation of stringent peace terms, and the curtailment of individual ambitions on the part of the Allies. His Majesty&apos;s War Cabinet have given the matter immediate and most serious consideration. They are of opinion (and have informed the United States Ambassador) that if the Allies&apos; purchases in America cannot be financed by the United States Government, the whole financial fabric of the Alliance stands in imminent peril, of collapse. Up till now Great Britain has borne the entire burden of financing the Allies ; the assistance which she has been called upon to render to Italy, France, Belgium and Russia during the past few months has been on an undiminished scale, the advances to France alone being at the rate of 1,000,000?-. a day for the past three weeks. The British Treasury is still&apos; accepting responsibility for Russian and Belgian expenditure in the United States, but its resources for making payments on that side are now exhausted.A further despatch from Sir C. Spring Rice (17th July) announced that he had arranged to discuss the situation, with the Secretary of the Treasury. He believes that it is beginning to be understood that further purchases by the Allies in the &quot;United States will have to be financed by the American Government. In a conver-sation with the Canadian Minister of Finance, Mr. McAdoo had been cordial and sympathetic.In connection with the actual position of American finance and the attitude of the Secretary of the Treasury, it is worthy of note that Sir C. Spring Rice recently reported confidentially with regard to Mr. McAdoo Is repeated hints and endeavours to induce Sir R. Crawford to agree to the United States taking over the ships now building for His Majestyls Government in America. On 6th July His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador observed that it was clearly the intention of the United States Govern-ment to acquire these vessels if possible, and that &quot;they are hoping that our financial &quot; embarrassments will relieve them of the ungracious task of imposing that intention &quot; upon us.&quot; He then thought it possible that a surrender of the ships might serve to strengthen the position of the Treasury vis-a-vis Congress.General Goethals, as Manager of the &quot; Emergency Fleet Corporation &quot; appointed by the President, has published his programme of construction; it provides for the building of about 4,700,000 tons of shipping (of which 1,500,000 tons would be wood and the remainder steel) within a period of 18 to 24 months. It indicates the intention not to seize the ships building for His Majesty&apos;s Government if the latter pay the cost of expediting construction. Sir C. Spring Rice states that there are still sighs of conflict between General Goethals and Mr. Denman, President of the Shipping Board, and that this building programme may become tbe subject of dispute.The State Department have renewed their representations to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador on the subject of American goods of German origin lying at Rotterdam. Great pressure is being brought to bear by Congress on the Administration in this matter. The State Department cannot see what good purpose is being served by refusing to allow this cargo to&apos; come forward, as the German manufacturers were long since paid and have no further interest in the goods. Sir C. Spring Rice concurs and advises that shipment of all goods should be allowed, where proof is produced that the American&quot; importers actually paid for them and applied; for shipment before 1st November 1915.The United States Ambassador in London has informed His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Secretaries of War and the Navy would welcome the establishment of a3441-3 E
British naval and military mission, in addition to the existing personnel at Washington.Lord Northcliffe having reported through the Embassy (12th July) the prevalence in New York of a rumour, to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government were about to take over Bearsons&apos; properties in Mexico and embark upon a general oil business, His Mnjesty&apos;s Ambassador has been authorised to contradict this rumour, and to explain the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter. These are, to afford financial assistance to a new company, in the event of Bearsons&apos; disposing of their interests, so as to maintain the business as British property in British hands.THE SHIPPING SITUATION.Sir E. Howard reports increasing indignation in western Sweden on account of the promiscuous sinking of Swedish fishing boats by German submarines, outside the limits of the prescribed area. On 12th July 10 of these vessels were reported to have been sunk.With regard to the position of Swedish shipowners, and their recent claim (vide last Report) for increased outside-port calling facilities. His Majesty&apos;s Government have directed Sir E, Howard to intimate to those concerned, that these privileges cannot be allowed generally to all vessels of a particular flag, except in return for definite and adequate services by these vessels. Arrangements on this basis have been concluded with Denmark and Norway, and are now under negotiation with Holland. If the Swedish Government desire such general facilities, it will be necessary for them to enter into similar arrangements, allowing a proportion of Swedish tonnage to be used in Allied interests. If the Swedish Government are not prepared to do so, His Majesty&apos;s Government will give preference and privileges to those Swedish shipowners who are trading, or ready to trade, in Allied interests.Sir M. Findlay has drawn attention to the fact that, by the special grace of the German Government, originally conveyed to the Norwegian Government by assurances of the German Minister at Christiania, there has been no submarine interference with Norway&apos;s trade to and from the United States, ddie Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed the opinion on 12th July that this immunity is likely to continue. Sir M. Findlay believes that the German Governments object is (1) to prevent Norway joining the Allies, and providing them with a naval base on her coast, and (2) to preserve a channel of communication with the United States, and to facilitate the passage of spies and correspondence to and from that countiy.The suggestions put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government for time chartering, or purchasing, the Brazilian Lloyd vessels now at Cardiff, have not proved acceptable to the Brazilian Government. Jney now ask that the vessels may be armed in England preparatory to their voyage to Brazil. Nor is the Brazilian Lloyd Company prepared to give assurances that these vessels will return to European -waters. Under these circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government have requested the Brazilian Minister to enquire whether his Government will give formal guarantees that ex-German vessels of an equivalent cargo-carrying capacity will be sent to trade with, and for, Allied countries as soon as their repairs are completed.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.On 11th July the Sovyets Bureau at Stockholm issued a bulletin announcing that, as the result of deliberations with the Russian delegates, the German Minority Socialists had accepted the Sovyets programme of 25th April and were prepared to take part in an International Conference. The leader of the German Majority delegates could not bind his party to adherence to the Sovyet programme, and was therefore going to Berlin for instructions. On the 12th it was announced that the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee and the Russian delegation had joined forces, to work under a common executive, and had decided to invite workmen&apos;s organisations of all kinds throughout the world to attend an International Conference, to be held at Stockholm on 15th August. All groups, parties and associations affiliated to the International Socialist Bureau or to the &quot; Syndicalist International &quot; are invited. The organisers of the Conference, after outlining their programme, have intimated that,, in order to secure peace, the &quot;International&quot; must persuade all Socialists and Syndicalists to have no connection with their Governments if they decline to state
clearly their war policy, or have formulated aims of an Imperialistic character. Associations attending the Conference will be bound by its resolutions. (This stipulation is contrary to the ideas originally expressed hy Mr. Branting.)Sir E. Howard considers it practically impossible that the Conference should take place on 15th August, as several of the Russian delegates desire first to visit London, Paris and Rome. The Swedish elections take place in September, so that if the Conference is not held in August, it would have to be postponed for some time. It being probable that the German Government will not allow their Minority Socialists to attend it, Sir E. Howard advises that discussions with the Russian delegates should be prolonged to the utmost in London and Paris, so that the first refusal to attend the Conference may come from Berlin. Mr. Plenderson, after consulting Mr. Branting, recommends that the proposed Allied Socialist Conference be held as soon as possible, to prepare for united, action at Stockholm.On 14th July the Foreign Office informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Petrograd that the Seamen&apos;s and FiremeFs Union, had definitely refused to carry Mr. Ramsay Macdonald to Russia, but they still desired to send their own delegates to Petrograd. Sir G. Buchanan, in reply, expressed his opinion that if they came without Mr. Macdonald they would meet with a bad reception from the Russian Socialists, who would be sure to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government only allowed those persons to go to Russia who represent the official view.Sir H. Rumbold is informed that Erzbergefs attitude in the Reichstag was inspired from Austria, and that its chief inspiration comes from the Catholic peace movement, i.e., from the reluctance of the Church to see all initiative pass into the hands of the Social Democrats. Count de Sabs, on the other hand, sees no reason to justify the belief that the Vatican has been in any way identified with ErzbergePs proceedings. His Holiness has recently authorised the publication of a statement in the &quot;Tablet,&quot; declaring it to be &quot;absolutely untrue that the Holy See is aiding a peace movement on behalf of Austria.&quot;According to a statement emanating from the Austrian Legation at the Hague, Plindenburg opposed the &quot;peace without annexations &quot; idea at Vienna on the ground that, unless she can secure commercial control of Belgium, Germany will be bankrupt.In a published, interview after his return from Russia, M. Albert Thomas discussed the question of Alsace Lorraine, and suggested that it might be advisable to allow the future of the lost provinces to be determined by a plebiscite. So great has been the indignation raised by this utterance, that the personal position of M. Thomas has been seriously affected. At the 4th of July banquet in Paris, at which both M. Ribot and M. Thomas were present, the former found it necessary to repudiate the suggestion on behalf of the Ministry, and M. Thomas was obliged to accept this public repudiation.GENERAL.The Italian Government and Military Authorities recently invited the attention of the British Government to the serious consequences that must follow if, as they had reason to belieA&apos;e, arrangements might possibly be concluded between Russia and Austria for the exchange of prisoners who have been more than 18 months in captivity, following upon the arrangements recently made between Great Britain and Germany. AVhile explaining that those arrangements referred only to the internment in Holland of sick and. wounded prisoners, His Majesty&apos;s Government have made representations at Betrograd in the sense desired by the Italian Government, and have received in reply an assurance that there is no question of any exchange of Russian and Austrian prisoners.Greatly deploring Germany&apos;^ increasing tendency to inflict reprisals on prisoners of war, His Majesty the King of Spain has offered to make representations to the German Government on the subject, should His Majesty&apos;s Government so desire. Sir A. Hardinge has been instructed, in reply, to express appreciation of His Majesty&apos;s kindly interest in the matter, and to state that it was discussed at the recent Conference at The Hague, and an agreement concluded, to give at least four weeks&apos; notice of intention to inflict reprisals in any given case.His Majesty&apos;s Government have renewed their request to the Dutch authorities to press the Turkish Government for an immediate reply concerning the exchange of incapacitated prisoners of war. The International Red Cross (Berne) have also applied to the Turkish Government for permission to send delegates to visit all the
ISprisoners&apos; camps where British subjects are interned in Turkey, especially the working camps in Taurus, which are the worst. They have pointed out that they are entitled to make these inspections as a matter of reciprocal right.Satisfactory assurances having now been given by the German Government respecting the delivery of parcels to French prisoners of war in Germany, the French authorities have approved the cessation of retaliatory measures in France.Sir R. Paget reported on 12th July that an examination of the records of the Central Prisoners of AVar Bread Bureau at Copenhagen has revealed a discrepancy of some 29,000 parcels short-delivered to British prisoners at Ruhleben between 13th January and 2nd June, and that similar shortages have occurred at other camps. He&quot; considers that the blame lies with the former Director of the Bureau, Mr. Slade, and urges that, in the interests of the prisoners and in justice to the subscribers to the fund, the present Director should be summoned to London forthwith for a- full investigation.
APPENDIXtoWestern and General Report No. 25.DOMINION LABOUR VIEWS ON&apos; CONSCRIPTION AND THE WAR.The attitude of Labour towards the war and conscription differs to a considerable extent in the variousdJoininions ; it may also be said that the influence of Labour upon general political policy has attained a different position in each of the Dominions.Canada.Unlike other Dominions, Canada has practically no direct Labour representation in Parliament, and the only representative who may be said to represent Labour interests as an ex-President of the Trades and Labour Congress (Mr. Verville), is, in fact, a member of the regular Opposition. While a Parliamentary Labour Party does not, therefore, at present exist in the Dominion House of Commons, an indication of the position adopted by organised Labour towards matters of general policy is perhaps best found in the pronouncements of the Trades and Labour Congress. This Congress represents somewhere about 80,000 members, or about half the Trade Unionists of Canada.On 7th May last the President of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada issued an invitation on behalf of the Executive Council to a Conference at Ottawa on 1st June. The reason given was that efforts were being put forth for the institution of Compulsory Service for industrial purposes and also for military purposes, and therefore that it had been considered highly advisable to call that Conference, constituted of Canadian delegates representing national unions and international unions with local affiliations in Canada. It was also pointed out that as the fuuction of the Trades and Labour Congress was purely legislative in the interests of the workers of Canada, it was considered advisable to confer with the direct representatives of the International Unions, upon whose recommendations the most effective direct action could be taken. As a result, 80 International Trade Unions, including the Railroad Brotherhoods, wrere represented at the four days&apos; Conference. Resolutions which had been sent to the Executive Council of the Trades and Labour Congress from local unions and Trades and Labour Councils in all parts of the Dominion relating to Conscription were considered, and in the course of a Resolution the Conference declared that the situation did not demand Conscription, and proceeded r &quot; The necessities for the effective conduct of the war are food, munitions, shipping and military man-power, and Canada is geographically well situated to supply the first-named three essentials, and can do much to assist in winning the war by developing her production in these essentials to her fullest exteut. We are strongly of opinion that this is the best service that Canada, with her small population, can render.&quot; We declare ourselves as most emphatically opposed to the proposed Conscription Measure, and we urge the workers of Canada to oppose by every means in their power the enactment of such legislation.&quot;The Conference also carried a Resolution in favour of the nationalisation of coal-fields and railways, and of the extension of the xirinciple in order thoroughly to bring the food resources of the country into the hands of the people and out of the hands of monopolists.Subsequently (loth June) the President of the Trades and Labour Congress, Mr. J. C. Watters, stated that although Sir Robert Borden had announced on 27th December that before adopting Conscription he would consider it his duty to consult organised Labour, the Congress Executive were not in fact consulted.1 They, how-ever, sought an interview with the Prime Minister after his. pronouncement of J8th May to learn the reasons for bis change of attitude, and at this interview, Mr. Watters states, the Prime Minister did not convince them of the necessity for a change from- 1 Mr. Watters lias since declared (ICtli July) that Sir R. Borden was guilty of a breach of faith in not consul dug organised Labour before introducing Conscription.3441-3 f
&quot;Voluntary to Compulsory Service. The President of the Congress further observes that the information he obtained, both in Canada and the United States,&quot; all went to demonstrate that the need of the hour was not men at the front so much as food for the people in our Motherland, Prance and Italy, the means for transportation of the same by overcoming the submarine menace, and the manufacturing of all Avar supplies and building of ships.&quot; The greatest service that Canada can render the Allies, therefore, is to conscript (not borrow) the wealth of the nation, to take over and operate all mines, railroads, munition Avorks and other establishments necessary to the prosecution of the war (including the banking system)^ to eliminate the last arestige of profiteering, thus giving the nation the benefit, instead ol the profiteer, of the Avork done.&quot; The conscription of 50,000 to 100,000 men to send to the front, where they are of comparatively minor importance, looks pathetically inadequate alongside the tremendous service which could be rendered the Empire by setting at naught the Avould-be order of things and consecrating the Avhoie power of the nation to winning the war.&quot;It will thus be seen that the attitude adopted by the recent Labour Conference and the President of the Trades and Labour Congress was in relation more to the methods by which Canada could assist the Empire rather than to any opposition to the Dominion playing her full part in the war.The Resolution passed^at the last monthly Meeting of the Halifax District Trades and Labour Council indicated a somewhat similar standpoint. After stating that any attempt to force conscription without first consulting the people of Canada Avas undemocratic, the Council resolved : &quot; That no form of conscription should be submitted to the people unless it carries Avith it provision for the nationalisation of food supplies, the conscription of surplus Avealth, the control and operation by the Dominion of Canada of all industries essential to the carrying on of the Avar, and that the machinery for carrying out ihese essentials be created and maintained on a national basis.&quot;The position taken up at Halifax also found favour with the Greater Toronto Labour Party. At a Meeting on 18th June, attended, by over a hundred delegates, the Party recorded itself in favour of the conscription, of man-poAver only on condition that food, wealth, railways, steamships and all other resources of the nation be conscripted for the winning of the war.On the other hand, the various Socialist Organisations in Toronto have formed a permanent Committee to fight Conscription, even if it becomes law.A Meeting of the Federation of Labour Clubs of Montreal was held about the middle of last month, when a Resolution was passed calling upon the Government to bring about a General Election, and another asked that men. of Allied countries now in Canada be conscripted before Canadians, or sent home. The speakers took the line that the great need was for food, and not for men.As previously pointed out,1 Mr. Vervilie, in his speech in the Conscription Debate in the House of Commons on 29th. June, Avarned the Government that organised labour would call a general strike if conscription Avas adopted without the people being consrdted. lie claimed that ho spoke for 85 per cent, of the organised labour of Canada and that labour &quot; stood against compulsion of any sort ... Even &quot; if all members of organised labour are exempted, it will not alter their determina-&quot; tion,&quot; he declared, though he added that labour Avould submit loyally to the result of the Referendum if conscription Avere carried by this method. The position assumed by Mr. Yerville Avas supported by the Calgary Trades and Labour Council, who decided at the end of last month to take a vote of all unions on a proposal to declare a general strike in the event of conscription being enforced. This attitude Avas endorsed by the Quebec Local Union of Stationary Engineers a day or so afterwards. The Government, hoAvever, have indicated during the Committee stage of the Compulsory Service Pill that they will take strong action against any attempt to declare a general strike, and the Solicitor-General has moved an additional clause providing that any person who advocates that any man liable to conscription should disobey or fail to comply with the requirements of the Act, or influences others to impede the execution of the Act, shall be liable to imprisonment for from one to five years.* See Western and General Report for week ending 4th July 1917, under &quot; Canada.&quot;
It is worth noting in this connection that in the United. States organised labour has approved of the system of selective conscription, and this will, no doubt, exercise a great deal of influence on the International Unions in Canada.Australian Commonwealth.Though the political influence of Labour in Australia is more pronounced than in any other Dominion, there has, of course, been considerable division in the ranks of the Labour movement as a result of Mr. Hughes&apos; Conscription Campaign.While Mr. Hughes has still with him in the National Party a number of those who have been Labour supporters all their lives, 3Tet the political attitude of Labour must be considered largely to be represented at the present moment-by the official Parliamentary Labour Party, of which Mr. Tudor is new the leader. The attitude of this Party towards the war has been to recognise that the war is the most pressing-question confronting the Commonwealth (vide Appendix to Report No. 20), and the Manifesto of the Federal Labour Party issued in March last recognised the clanger of German power in the Pacific, at any rate so far as the immediate interests of Australia were concerned. The following passage indicates the position of the Labour Party in this direction : &quot; Pecent developments in aerial and submarine warfare indicate the perils which would threaten this continent if a potential enemy were permitted to acquire or resume sovereignty of the islands adjacent to Australia. In enemy control these islands would furnish numerous bases of operations for incessant raids on our coasts.&quot;It is true that certain Labour organisations have exhibited a more pacifist tendency than the strictly political Labour Party, and, indeed, the Industrialists generally may be said to consider the policy of the Parliamentary Labour Party to be of too moderate a character. For example, the Inter-State Labour Conference, representative of every State of the Commonwealth, carried a motion in December-last expelling from the movement all the members of the Federal Parliament who advocated conscription.1 This same Conference urged Great Britain and the Allies to formulate Beace terms.Again, at, the recent2 Labour Conference of the State of New South Wales a Resolution was adopted urging- the Convocation of an International Peace Conference on which the workers should be represented, and proposing that the Dominions and Ireland should.have separate representation at the Conference, and in the drawing up of the terms of Peace. The pacifist Resolutions at this Conference, however, were opposed by the Leader of the State Parliamentary Labour Party (Mr. J. Storey), a considerable number of those at the Conference considering the proposals as leading to &quot; Peace at any price &quot; ; and Mr. Hughes subsequently declared &quot; the views of the New South Wales Conference cannot be regarded as setting out those of &quot; organised Labour, as the recent elections&quot; showed when the issue wras the &quot; prosecution of the war to a finish. The Unions,&quot; he added, &quot; are leaving the &quot; Labour Leagues4 daily.&quot;An organisation which has received perhaps more notice than its strength in the country deserves is that termed &quot; The Industrial Workers of the World.&quot; This body has not been successful in securing the return of any candidates to either the Federal or State Parliaments, and in the recent elections for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly only one of the Labour representatives who could be said to have I.WAV. sympathies was returned, and he was not actually a member of the organisation. Nevertheless, the propaganda work of this body has been considerable, and Mr. Hughes pointed out, in moving the Second Reading of the Unlawful Associations Bill in December last, &quot;its influence is not to be measured merely by its membership.&quot; Shortly, the objects of the organisation, as stated by Mr. Hughes in quoting from its preamble, are to secure the economic heritage of the workers of the world by means of the General Strike. This, as Mr. Hughes pointed out, was not for remedying a specific grievance in working conditions, but for the purpose of effecting a permanent economic revolution. Having declared that &quot; the Industrial Workers of the World doctrines are a grave menace to Society,&quot; that &quot; the inner council is composed of reckless, dangerous men, many of whom have1 Similar action -was taken by the Labour Conference of the State of New South Wales. 2 June 1917.3 Reference is made to the Federal Elections of May 1917.4 The Labour Leagues in Australia recommend the selection of Parliamentary candidates to the Conferences.3441-3 g
&quot;criminal records,&quot; and that &quot;a large number of the members of the association &quot; are foreigners and a fair number Germans,&quot; Mr. Hughes said that it was necessary to pass the measure in order to prevent the members of the association inciting others to commit such crimes as were alleged against them, e.g., &quot;murder, arson, forgery, aiding and abetting sabotage in its attack upon the life of the nation.&quot;The Leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr. Tudor, who has opposed the Industrial Workers of the World throughout, has described the subject as a &quot;bogey,&quot; which was found serviceable to the- opponents of the Labour Party during the Referendum campaign and the State elections of New South Wales.  -New Zealand.The Military Service Act, providing for compulsory military service in New Zealand, was put into active operation in November last year, when the first ballots, to provide the full quotas from each district, were taken under it. There had been strong opposition in the Plouse during the passage of the Bill from the few members of the Labour Party. The line taken during the discussions upon the Bill by the Labour members was that it would be &quot;far better to conscript the wealth, of this &quot; country in order to set free men, who now, because of their obligations, cannot go to &quot; the front.&quot;   The second reading of the Bill, however, was carried by 49 votes to 5.There was not much industrial disturbance as a result of the passing of the Act, but at the end of November the Blackwall Coal Miners&apos; Union officially notified their Company that they had decided to strike until a Referendum, was taken on the question of whether the Military Service Act should be repealed or not. In the State Coal Mine of Rewanui the men passed a resolution that if any of them were conscripted the remainder would cease work.Undoubtedly the result of the Referendum in Australia encouraged the opponents of conscription to agitate for the repeal of the Act; and at the end of December last year a Conference was convened at Wellington by the United Federation of Labour (having 80 affiliated organisations), the Waterside . Workers&apos; Federation (representing 18 organisations), and the Miners&apos; Federation (representing 12 bodies). There were also delegates at this Conference from the Social Democratic party , the Labour Representation Committee, Trades and Labour Councils, Railway Workers, &amp;c, and other Unions and Societies to the number of 59. The following Resolutions were passed at the Conference : &quot; That the Conference recommends to the Trade Unions, Political Labour Parties, and kindred organisations, a National campaign to secure the repeal of the Military Service Act,&quot; and&quot; That the President, Vice-president and Secretary, of the National Labour Party seek legal opinion as to whether the Military Service Act is in agreement with the Act of Constitution, and that they be empowered to take a test case to the Supreme Court if the opinion is in that direction.&quot;As a result of the Resolutions, a large deputation, comprising the majority of the delegates, waited on the Minister of Railways. The Chairman of the Conference, who was also President of the United Federation of Labour, argued that &quot; the number of &quot; men who had left the country was ample, in proportion to the population, and it &quot; was felt that if the drain went on much longer, there-was a very grave danger of &quot; labour being brought in from other sources .... Failing the repeal of the Act, a &quot; Referendum should be taken to ascertain if the people were favourable to it or not. &quot; The workers were not altogether united on the question of a Referendum, but were &quot;unanimous that the Act should be repealed.&quot; The Minister, in reply, stated that the Government took fulPresponsibility for its actions, and was bound to take, and did take, the Act of Parliament as an expression of the will of the people of the country. He pointed out that if Parliament were called together there was very little chance of the Act being repealed, and that it need not be put into force throughout the Dominion so long as sufficient volunteers came forward.Under the Act, Military Service Boards were appointed to hear appeals for exemption, and the Government appointed a stipendiary magistrate to be Chairman of each Board, and gave one of the two other appointments to a Labour representative.There have been various prosecutions for seditious speeches, and in the more recent industrial troubles2 the miners adopted the &quot; go-slow &quot; policy. The Military Service Boards, however, issued warnings that unless the output was kept, up to normal, exemptions could not he granted, and after a visit to the Coast by the Minister1 The Secretary of this Party was arrested in December 1916 for publishing seditious utterances. 2 April 1917,
of Defence and the Minister of Mines, the men returned to work on the condition that a Conference was arranged with the employers, and that penalties should not he imposed on the men.who had been arrested for the &quot; go-slow-&quot; policy. On the whole, it has rather surprised the Ministers that the general body of Labour has accepted the compulsion provided in the Military Service Act so readily, and there have been comparatively few desertions.South Africa.The Labour representation in the South African House of Assembly at present numbers only four, but the strength of the party in the House can hardly be said to represent the position it has latterly attained throughout the Union.The attitude of the political Labour Party at the time the present war broke out was indicated in the House of Assembly by its leader, Mr. (now Lieutenant-Colonel) Creswell. In speaking upon the motion of the Prime Minister assuring the King of the loyal support of South Africa in the war, Mr. Creswell moved, to add at the end of the Resolution &quot; and further humbly request His Majesty to take every possible measure to ensure that at the termination of the present war there shall be a general reduction of armaments, and that in future international differences shall be settled by arbitration, and an end be put to the system by which civilised, peoples are hurled into a state of war without their consent being first obtained.&quot;The proposed amendment went on to declare it to be the duty of the Government to provide for the carrying on of all wealth producing activities, so that there should .be no unnecessary curtailment of public and other works.Between the outbreak of the Avar and the South African General Election of October 1915, a section of the Labour Party formed itself, under the leadership of Mr. Andrews, M.L.A., into what was called &quot; The War on War League,&quot; which took up a strong opposition to the war, and was representative generally of extreme Socialist tendencies. Mr. Creswell strongly repudiated the views of this party,1 who, he said, did not represent the South African Labour Party. The latter, he declared, heartily co-operated with the Imperial Government in seeing the war through.The division in the Labour Party did not, however, come to a climax until the Party Congress, consisting of representatives from all parts of the Union, which met in Johannesburg in August 1915. This Congress was specially summoned by Mr. Andrews. Mr. Creswell submitted a Resolution which whole-heartedly supported the rendering by the Union of all possible assistance to the Imperial Government in the prosecution of the war. The Resolution also declared that the financial responsi-bility for the dependants of members of the Union, and also of the permanently disabled, should be a national obligation. It further called on the Government, owing to the accentuated conditions caused by the war, to abolish unemployment and assume the control during the war of the necessaries of life, and also of the natural resources of the country, of which full use was not being made. The &quot; War on War &quot; speakers took the line that the enemy was not Germany but the Capitalists, but Mr. Creswelbs Resolution was adopted by So votes to 29.The Labour Congress also passed the following Resolution by 51 votes against 22, namely : &quot;When the enemy have been driven out of, or have evacuated, all territory outside their own borders, the Union Government should represent to the Imperial Government the advisability of stating what terms of peace would be acceptable to the Allies, the principle of these terms to be a general reduction of armaments, the submission of international disputes to arbitration, and the right of nations to determine their own form of government.&quot;Though before the war the Labour Party had secured some success by a victory in the Transvaal Provincial Elections, it had a set-back at the General Election of 1915, when only three members were returned to the House of Assembly. This may have been due in considerable measure to the unpopularity of the &quot; War on War&quot; Party, but however this may be, Mr. Andrews, the leader of that party, was himself defeated in his own constituency. Mr. Creswell (then serving as a Major in the German South-West Campaign) was also  defeated,  though he has  succeeded in.e.g.. see speech at Fordsburg, July 1915.
returning to Parliament at a recent bye-election,1 where an international Socialist: candidate was run against him.2 Since his return to Parliament, Lieutenant-Colonel Creswell has taken a strongly patriotic position with regard to the war, and in the recent debate3 upon Mr. Merriman&apos;s Resolution condemning Republican propaganda, declared that in connection with the.post-war settlement, he was-&quot;&apos;   r;        \,:&quot;convinced that the working classes of South Africa would-be filled with alarm at any possibility of South West Africa being returned to the Germans.. We, in South Africa, have not assisted in the war from any desire to, take land, but because we believe it to be right, and we cannot contemplate with equanimity the re-establishment of German power on our borders.&quot;He further emphasised in this speech that the Labour Party would continue, to support the Government in its war policy. -.,  :On the other hand, the Party now termed &quot; The International:&apos; Socialist League &quot; are not devoid of activity. A Socialist meeting was recently held in Johannesburg,4 for the purpose of sending a delegation to the Stockholm, Peace Conference, and if was the occasion of somewhat violent scenes. Idle Chairman,-who was one of the strike leaders deported to England in January 1914-, would -not allow the members of the League to put their amendment, but on his subsequently leaving, the Meeting, the International Socialists passed a Resolution to send Mr. Andrews as their -delegate to Stockholm.1 Troyville bye-election, 26th. January 1917. 2 This candidate only secured 32 votes. 3 19th June.4 See Western and General Report for week ending 27th June 1917.
