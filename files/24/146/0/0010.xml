SEC! RET.APPRECIATION  OP THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT, No.  10.Greece.The attitude of. the French Commission on Foreign Affairs, and General SarraiTs increasing restlessness, point to the prospect of renewed trouble with Greece. Now that the Greek Army has been safely shepherded into the Morea, no serious military consequences need be feared from any further harrying of the Greek Government. But Greek exasperation against the French may have to be reckoned with as a permanent factor in future, and one incompatible with the realisation of French ambitions in the Balkans.German Internal Conditions. .German Liberal papers pour contempt on President WilsoiFs statement that Americans quarrel is only with Prussian autocracy and not with the German people, treating it as a clumsy attempt to create discord in Germany by inventing a difference which does not exist. But no doubt President Wilson was thinking mainly of the soothing effect of his phrases on the Germans in the United States.Meanwhile there is evidently a growing recognition in Germany that the existing political system needs some remodelling. The appointment of a Constitutional Committee by the Reichstag to examine questions of representation and the relations between, the people and the Government of the Empire is probably something more than a mere shelving of the question.The efforts of the German. Socialists to get in touch with the Russian Socialist movement are most significant. It looks as if the German Government were encouraging the diversion of the general pacifist tendencies of German Socialism into the specific channel of an attempt to make peace with Russia.Holland.The Dutch. Government in their fear of provoking Germany have definitely declined, to modify their refusal to allow armed merchant ships into their ports. It remains to be seen, what measures will have to be taken, by the Allies to bring home to them the consequences of their attitude. What between Germany&apos;s increasing desperation on the one side, and the probability of more drastic action against neutrals by the Allies now that America has ceased to be a neutral, the position of a small neutral like Holland is anything but enviable.Sweden.Since the attached Report was written the Swedish Government have come forward with proposals indicating a genuine desire to conclude a reasonable&apos; agreement with us, and even offering to let some, at any rate, of our ships through the Kogrund Passage.
o&apos; China.The attitude of the French and Russian Ministers at Peking towards China&apos;s proposals for entering the war on. our side is to be regretted. In. place of the generous treatment advocated by Great Britain and Japan the chief reward, they propose that China should receive for her co-operation, is the privilege of becoming more deeply indebted to international finance.United States.The most significant feature of the Presidents address was the promise of unstinted, support to the Allies. That this will, be forthcoming there need be no doubt.L. S. A.5th April 1917.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.&apos; IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.The Secretary of State has informed the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth that he will telegraph for his information all Resolutions passed by the Imperial War-Conference.In pursuance of this arrangement the Secretary of State telegraphed the following Resolution, passed by the Conference on the 30th March, viz. : That the Admiralty be requested to work out, immediately after the conclusion of the war, what they consider the most effective scheme of Naval Defence for the Empire for the consideration of the several Governments summoned to this Conference, with such recommendations as the Admiralty consider necessary in that respect for the Empire&apos;s future security., ;   GENERAL.The Secretary of State has informed, the Governments of all the Dominions that, owing to unexpected difficulties, the arrangements for the appointment of II.R.1I. the Duke of Connaught as Inspector-General of: Oversea Forces in the United Kingdom cannot be carried out.CANADA.The Minister of Trade and Commerce has cabled to the Secretary of State pointing-out that permission has not yet been given for wool, purchased before or after 1st March, to be exported from Australia to Canada. As the manufacturers of the Dominion have large credits lying in. Melbourne, they will be forced to close their factories unless the permission is granted. The Minister urges that action should be taken, more especially as he understands that permission of the nature desired has already been given, to France and the United States of America.With reference to previous telegrams on this subject, the Canadian Government have been informed that the New Zealand Authorities are supplying 7,500 bales of wool and that information about Australian wool will be sent later.The Shipping Controller has conveyed an expression of his strong hope that the Dominion Government will requisition the vessels which are now being built for Norwegian owners. Relying on this action, by the Canadian authorities, the Controller is not taking any steps to purchase these ships.A request from the French Government has been conveyed to Dominion Ministers that protection should, be afforded to the landing places of St. Pierre and Miquclou Cable. For this purpose the British Admiralty advise the establishment of a patrol in the Cabot Straits, though they recommend that vessels used, in this capacity should, also be available for other patrol and anti-submarine work.The Admiralty have inquired whether 3.0 motor boats for anti-submarine work could, be constructed for the Italian Government without prejudicing the speedy completion of trawlers, drifters, and merchant ships already being built in Canadian yards.The Mayor of Quebec has telegraphed to Mr. Lloyd. George pointing out that the cancellation of the contracts for the supply of tblTRoMHKne is a very serious matter for more than 2,000 families. The earnest wish is expressed that the contracts may be continued as the men hitherto employed in the manufacture are being daily paid off.The Prime Minister has replied that while deeply regretting any loss occasioned, he cannoTov^flhle the Ministry of Munitions, whose decision was made in the interests of efficiency. He expresses the belief that the persons affected will continue to work in similar directions.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The Commonwealth Shipping Board do not,consider that there is much chance of vessels engaged in coasting trade being released for ocean service, as the tonnage is now insufficient for the urgent necessities of inter-State traffic. Owing, however, to the probable installation of mechanical, appliances at certain ports, it is possible that two States may be able to spare a few ships.
SOUTH AFRICA.The. Army Council have, placed before the Union Government their wish, to enlist natives of Africa and India for the Royal Horse and Royal Field Artillery in order to replace white personnel in certain units. As to numbers, it is stated that I3y645 skilled drivers will be wanted, while 4,641 unskilled men, capable of handling heavy weights, will be required as gunners. It is pointed out that those enlisted for the service indicated would be regarded as combatants and might be employed under fire. &apos;The Union Ministers are showing some apprehension regarding the limitation of the value of any single shipment of diamonds to 20,000 . As a great deal of the revenue of the Union is derived from diamonds, any interference with the industry would force the Government to seek the assistance of the British Treasury to the extent to which the revenue might fall below the expenditure. It is also mentioned, that the diamond trade with the United States influences the rate of exchange between London and New York.The Commander-in-Chief has requested that reinforcements for the 1st Cape Coloured Labour Battalion may be sent as soon as possible. The number should amount to 25 per cent, of the present establishment.In the Budget for 1916-17 the estimated surplus of 400,0001. is to go to the redemption of debt. The estimated deficit for 1917-18 is 500.000Z., which will be met by various means, including the extension of the diamond export duty, excess profits&quot;tax, and the recasting of taxation of dividends and incomes. In the last-named connection, income wull be taxable in cases where it is,derived from a country outside the Union if, through absence of domicile or ordinary residence, the person is not -charged with income tax in. that country.NEWFOUNDLAND.It has been arranged to enlist, for the duration of the war, Newfoundland loggers and saw-mill hands for forestry work in the United Kingdom as non-combatant units. Arrangements will be made to release any of the skilled men after six months if they should be required by the industries of the Colony. The units will be under their own officers, but under the general direction of the War Office Timber Supply Department.GOLD COAST.   -The Officer Administering the Government reports that the difficulties relating to the native revolt at. Bole have now terminated. The Chief of Yabum surrendered before any active punitive measures became necessary. The disaffection is stated to have been due to recruiting.EAST AFRICA.The Governor of the Fast Africa Protectorate has inquired whether the British Government is willing to purchase and ship the maize crop which is now being planted and which will be harvested in November.The British Consul at Lorenzo Marques reports that a native revolt has broken out in the Barue region. The authorities consider that the disaffection may be due to enemy and missionary influence. In order to prevent the escape of the natives, the Southern Rhodesia officials are being asked to protect their frontier.FIJI.The Secretary of State has telegraphed to the Governor that .100 Fijians could be utilised for transport work at Calais. He suggests that the Colony might bear the cost of raising, equipping and transporting this force, and of providing for the allowances to dependants. All other expenses would be borne by the British Government.In reply, the Governor has telegraphed that an offer to provide the cost- as above -outlined has been received from Mr. Marks, the necessary funds to be found equally by himself and his company up to 10,0007.. The offer has been gratefully accepted by the Governor.
SIR A ITS SETTLEMENTS.The Governor reports that he proposes to order all lit men of military age who-can be spared to leave the Colony. Passports would only be issued to England and passages provided by the Government.TRINIDAD.Representations have been made by merchants to the Governor that space for shipment of the produce of the Colony on vessels of the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique and Italian Laviloce lanes has been reduced in favour of cargoes from Central America. It is submitted, that neutral produce should not be given preference in this Avay.JAMAICA.It is announced in the Press that the Legislative Council, have passed the second reading of the Conscription Bill, by a large majority, only three elected, members voting in opposition to the measure.PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.BELGIUM.The question of German safe-conducts for the Commission&apos;s relief ships remains at a deadlock, Germany insisting on being supplied with information, which the British Government have repeatedly declined to furnish, as to their whereabouts in British ports and sailing instructions. A Note Verbale of the German Government (March 19th), forwarded by the Dutch. Legation in Berlin, declares that Great Britain, must be held responsible for the cutting off of food supplies from the civil population of Belgium and Northern France; the same declaration, accompanied, by expressions of profound concern for the sufferings thus inflicted on these people, has been, spread broadcast by the German wireless. Messages to the American Press state that 13 ships have been held up in. Great Britain and their cargoes diverted to local, consumption. As a matter of fact, the four vessels have been unloaded, for which Germany offered safe-conducts to take effect on 1st May, as their cargoes would have become valueless by that date.The master of the belief&apos; Commission^ S.S. Ministre de Smet de Naeyer, lately arrived at Rotterdam, has reported that he was attacked by the shell tire of a German submarine in. the North Sea, but contrived to escape. The Norwegian S.S. Feinsle, laden witii American grain for the Relief Commission, was sunk off Te.rsehc.lJi.ng on 31st March.GREECE.&apos; Lord Bertie has communicated to the Foreign Office the views of the Commission of the French Chamber on Foreign Affairs, and of the President of the Council, in regard to the situation in Greece. There is a strong consensus of opinion, reflected in the Chamber and in the Press, that the time has come for the Allies to adopt a firmer line in dealing with King Constantine and his Government. This opinion has gained much ground since the retirement of M. Briand, who was able to restrain the advocates of extreme measures ; it has been reinforced by the change of regime in Russia, and by General sarrail&apos;s insistence on the necessity for obtaining satisfactory&quot; guarantees for the security of the Army of the East. In discussing the question with M. Cambon,Tils: Majesty&apos;s representative said that he had no reason to suppose that His Majesty&apos;s Government had altered their policy, which was opposed to extreme measures in Greece, or that such measures would find favour with the Italian Government.-The recent series of events at Zante forcibly illustrate, the difficulties inherent in the administration of Greece by two mutually antagonistic Governments and com-plicated by the divided counsels of the Allied Controls. The French Government have disavowed the action of Admiral Gauchet, who (25th March) restored the Royalist officials at Zante on his own authority. They are happy to be in agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the opinion that the Nationalist movement in the island having been spontaneous, the Allies could not do anything to suppress it without com-promising Veiiizelism throughout Greece.   They have therefore instructed the Admiral
to rescind such measures as he had taken and in all. similar circumstances hereafter -&quot;to allow the people to exercise their free initiative.&quot;   Lord Granville supports the : hope expressed by M. Yeuizelos that the guaranteeing Powers will consent to the island being administered by the Provisional Government.   In the opinion of His MajestyYs Government, communicated to Sir P. Elliot on 31st March, no general, line of action can be prescribed as applicable to similar risings against either of the . Governments -in Greece, and each case will  therefore have to be dealt with on its merits.Last week&apos;s summary recorded the statement made to the French Government by the representatives of M. Venizelos in Paris, that the position of affairs in Thessaly -had become desperate. With reference thereto, Sir F. Elliot has telegraphed a Report, dated. 29th March, from His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Larissa; it denies that Thessaly is being ravaged, by armed bands or that the condition of the inhabitants&apos; is desperate, and. suggests that the presence of the Allied forces in Macedonia should protect them against all dangers of their next crops being seized by the.Royalists. Lord Granville concurs in the opinion of his French colleague that a very salutary effect might be produced by conveying to the Greek Government an intimation, of General sarrail&apos;s readiness to occupy Thessaly in case of need ; at the same time he. cannot but view with suspicion any French proposal for the occupation of Greek districts, because of General SarraiBs personal aims and ambitions.The French Legation, at Athens concur in the opinion of Sir F. Elliot and Lord Granville, that General sarrail&apos;s proposed introduction of a forced French currency into new Greece would, lead to disastrous results. On their initiative, therefore, the National Bank has taken steps to provide Salonika with notes to the amount of-15 million drachmas at once, and to deposit a further 50 millions if the French, military authorities will give guarantees for their safe custody.&apos;The shortage of tonnage available for the provisioning of Greece continues and. the results are increasingly serious. Lord Granville reported on 2nd April that there -was no flour at Salonika except some that was lent by the French Army.The Government at Athens have renewed their application to the Allied Powers 1o secure the release of a number of Royalists detained in custody without cause by the Provisional Government.- In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, their release mast be dependent on. the grunt of a complete amnesty to Venizelists.Some delay has occurred as the result of the conditions imposed by His Majesty&apos;s Treasury in connection with the Auglo-French payments to be made to the Provincial Government for the mobilisation and maintenance of the Venizelos Army (vide Report No. 7). The French General in charge of Greek troops considers that some of these conditions are impracticable.The Diplomatic Body at Athens is much exercised in mind, concerning the expediency of attending their Independence Day Te Deum festival on 7th April. The French Minister is violently opposed to attending; the Russian and Italian,representatives would like to do so. As a solution, of the difficulty, Sir F. Elliot, as doyen, was deputed to propose to the Greek Government that no invitations should be issued for the ceremony ; the Minister for Foreign Affairs, however, took umbrage at this suggestion and refused, to comply with. it. The Prime Minister, when appealed, to, suggested that the Allies&apos; simplest solution would be to raise the blockade before Independence Day. Sir F. Elliot has requested that, if it is considered advisable that the Diplomatic Body should attend the function, the French Minister be positively instructed to do so. In a later telegram (3rd April) he reports that numerous warnings have been received of possible attacks on the day of the festival, by the Reservists on Venizelists, and even on the Entente representatives. He suggests that a solemn warning might have a salutary effect. His Majesty&apos;s Government decided, on the 4th that in. view of the attitude- of the Minister for Foreign Affairs it is not possible for the Allied -representatives to attend the ceremony.His Majesty&apos;s Minister has addressed a strong protest to the Prime Minister at Athens concerning the publication, in a distorted and calumnious form, of the draft agreement in regard to the personnel and proceedings of the Indemnities Commission. He also asked that the provisions of the penal code be enforced against certain newspapers which have published articles calling down popular vengeance upon anyone who, after betraying his king and. Country, dares to appeal to the Commission for compensation for the results of his treachery.The Serbian Government have received a communication, from the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that, under the new regime, the political sympathies of Russia towards Serbia and her aspirations remain unchanged ; that
GSerbia, can always count on Russkts powerful support; and that the question of the restoration of her State and frontiers will be settled at an opportune moment, account being&apos; taken of the declared (enonce.) principle of nationalities. gf The Minister for Foreign Affairs at Salonika has complained in confidence to Lord ^jr Granville on the subject of Mount Athos. It appears that the Russian Lieutenant in charge there has been forcibly coercing the Greek priesthood, to raise certain dependencies of Russian monasteries to the status of monasteries, with a view to increasing the Russian voting power, thereby violating the decisions recorded at the London Conference. The Minister complained also of the proceedings of the French at Koritsa, where, after effecting the Greek authorities, they had appointed a notorious scoundrel (since imprisoned) to be Prefect. A sort of independent Republic appears, he said, to have been established, which issues its own postal stamps and bank notes, and it was reported that Essad kasha was to be sent there.SWITZERLAND.The various arrangements (concerning rations, purchase of Swiss cattle, and other matters) covered lay the draft agreement signed at Berne on the 21st March, were provisionally approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government, subject to certain additional stipulations to be discussed with M. Deuys Cochin and to be agreed to by the Treasury. These stipulations refer to (1) supply by Switzerland to France and Italy of a monthly quota of timber at a fixed maximum price ; (2) chartering of tonnage by Swiss authorities; (3) cattle exports to Germany, and (4) oilcake supplies for Switzerland. It was further proposed, with regard to the purchase of Swiss cattle for France, that the necessary credits and payments lie arranged by the French Government. In this connection the British Government offered, as a free gift to France for the restocking of the invaded, provinces, the value of one-fourth of the cattle purchased, up to a maximum of: 500,000!. for the year.M. Denys Cochin, however, after discussion, of the British Governments proposals, adheres to his opinion that their advantages, from the blockade point of view, are outweighed by the financial burden and transport difficulties involved. He has proposed an alternative arrangement, -which he believes the Swiss Government can be persuaded to adopt, and with this end in view he is about to proceed to Berne. Sir II. Ru in bold has therefore been instructed to render him all possible assistance.The Swiss Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed to Si fit. Rum bold his anxiety at the reductions which have been effected in the Swiss rations under certain headings. His Majesty&apos;s Minister hopes that there may be no injudicious reductions of foodstuffs and other commodities needed by the Swiss people, as this might have a bad effect. Public opinion is at present very favourably disposed towards us, partly because of the manner in which our recent negotiations have been conducted, and partly because of the behaviour of the Germans during their retreat in Northern France.Negotiations for the revision of the German-Swiss agreement began at Berne on 1st April. Thereunder Switzerland, obtains coal, potatoes, iron, and steel in. return for cattle, chocolate, &amp;c. *The Federal Government still, complain that Swiss-owned, supplies of fertilisers are arbitrarily held up by the Italian authorities, but Sir R. Rodd&apos;s reports on the subject justify the hope that amicable arrangements may lie made.GERMAN INTERNAL  CONDITIONS.The official German wireless is at pains to emphasise the unanimous sympathy of all political parties in the Reichstag with the Russian revolution, and the German people&apos;s desire to conclude &quot; an honourable peace &quot; with Russia. Germany is described, as striving for a new order of things, broad based on. liberal principles, and. therefore incapable of sympathising with Tsardom. The Russian Socialists are assured that the Social Democratic Party in Germany &quot; will stand by them with all their forces, to prevent the re-establishment of autocratic government.&quot;Messrs. Haase and Ledebour, members of the Socialist party in the Reichstag, have sent to Mr. Brandling at Stockholm, for transmission to Mr. Tcheidze at Petrograd, a telegram of congratulation on the success of the Russian Revolution. Mr. Brandling, after forwarding the telegram, has proceeded in person to Petrograd. Sir E. Howard, reviewing all the facts of the situation, is inclined to the opinion that Mr. Brandting has been selected &quot;to confer with Mr, Tcheidze by the sections of Socialists in Germany and Austria who desire an immediate peace and the end
of Junkerdom. Bis Majesty&apos;s Government, concurring in the view that the moment is opportune for intensifying Socialist feeling in Germany against the present regime, has suggested to Sir E. Howard that he should take an early occasion of telling Mr. Brand ting privately, and as his personal opinion, that the chief obstacle to any discussion of peace terms is the continuance in power of the German military caste. Furthermore, that the Allies have no desire to destroy or dismember Germany, and that it would be much easier for them to treat for peace if a genuinely democratic form of: government were established in that country.A. circular issued by Mr. Michaelis to the. Agricultural Councils has, by some mistake, reached the hands of a Polish landowner. Its substance, as communicated from Berne, is to the effect that Germany is faced, with the spectre of famine. &quot; The Governments calculations in regard to crops have been false, and even the &quot; army is threatened with, famine. The Agricultural Councils are therefore invited &apos;&quot; to call upon landowners to have all their stocks of corn, threshed and forwarded &quot; to the Central Office, without regard to the question of seed corn for sowing &quot; purposes.&quot;A, recent arrival from Berlin at the Hague states that lie was escorted from, his hotel to the railway station in a carriage with drawn blinds, in order that lie might not see what was going on; there are persistent rumours of grave disorders in that city.Count, Reventlow in a violent article has taken exception to Count Czernins recent speech, and to his having spoken without authorisation, of the Chancellor.AUSTRIAN  INTERNAL  CONDITIONS.A. report from a well-informed quarter states that the Russian revolution has created a profound impression upon the Socialists in Austro-Hungary, and that it is likely to widen the breach, between them and the Social Democrats in Germany, by stimulating Austria&apos;^ desire for peace on lines very different from those upon which the Germans insist. An early pronouncement on the subject by the Austrian Socialist leader is expected, and the party confidently hope that their views will. find, favour with the Emperor.HOLLAND.In reply to Sir W. Towuley&apos;s suggestions as to the expediency of maintaining friendly relations with the Dutch Government (vide last Report), His M.ajesty&apos;s Government have stated for his guidance the considerations which influence them in maintaining a policy of vigilance and silent pressure. The object at which His Majesty&apos;s Government aim is to obtain security for the future rather than reparation for past grievances, and with this end in view, to discourage the Netherlands Govern-ment from arbitrarily interpreting international law, as they have frequently done, in a manner which operates to the detriment of Great Britain and to the advantage of Germany. The discrimination adopted against Dutch shipping (in the matter of facilities for calling at Halifax) is intended to bring it home to their Government that an unfriendly attitude must entail unpleasant consequences. Sir W. Townley has been directed to present to the Dutch Government a memorandum setting forth Great Britalids causes for reasonable complaint. At the same time he has been instructed to intimate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, if the Dutch Govern-ment persist in their arbitrary and biassed interpretation of international Jaw, His Majesty&apos;s Government may be compelled, to refuse to take part hereafter in any International Conferences at The Hague. Late on April the 3rd, Sir W. Townley telegraphed that the &apos; Minister for Foreign Affairs is genuinely alarmed at the threatening attitude of Germany. He believes that the German Government are seeking a pretext for a quarrel and. that they may find it in Hollands impending refusal to acquiesce in their demand (based on the release of the &quot;Princess Melita &quot;) for the release of the German submarines recently interned. The refusal to permit British armed merchantmen into Dutch ports will be presented at the same time as the answ-er to Germany ; it contains a detailed explanation of the Dutch point of view and an appeal to British generosity to refrain from the reprisals threatened. Sir W. Townley urges the adoption of a friendly attitude towards Holland and considers the moment favourable for some act of conciliation, such as the release of the Dutch fodder and provision ships now detained in British ports.
sDuring an interview at the Foreign Of;ice on the 31st March the Dutch-Minister inquired by what right the British Government claimed, to detain Dutch shipping. He was informed by Lord Robert Cecil that the right which Great Britain had. exercised in this matter was just as good as that which the Dutch Government invokes in excluding our armed merchantmen from their ports. Occasion was taken to point out that in laying up their ships the Dutch are actually promoting the-objects of Gennany&apos;s submarine warfare, and. that if this state of things^ continues strong measures may have to be applied.tHis Majesty&apos;s Minister has been directed to notify the Netherlands Overseas Trust that the supply of lubricants to German railway trucks in Holland must be stopped, and that if no satisfactory arrangement to this end is made, it may be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to prevent Holland from importing any lubricants.The -Dutch Food Controller has notified the British and Russian Ministers-(31st March) that it is not possible for the Netheriand Government to continue the-monthly supply of 400 tons of bread for Russian prisoners until the food situation in Holland is improved by the arrival of grain ships from North America. The President of the Oeuvre Nationale at Maastricht has asked for 150 tons a month for British, prisoners. Sir W. Townley enquires whether for the present the necessary supplies can be forwarded direct from Great Britain to the Oeuvre Internationale. In another despatch he expresses the hope that no difficulties will be raised to prevent the return of the 20 shix^s which sailed from Holland last month to bring foodstuffs from. North. America, and that they may be given the earliest possible despatch from Halifax.SWEDEN.The Ministry&apos;s resignation, following on that of the Prime Minister, was accepted by the King on. the 2,9th of March, and a new (iovernnsent formed under the leadership of Mr. Schwartz;, Chairman of the Parliamentary Financial Committee. (Mr. Schwartz is a leading banker, head of a group which competes with the Wallenbergs.) Only two members of the outgoing Government were included in the new, which, however, remains thoroughly Conservative. The- Liberal and Socialist Press are by no means satisfied with the composition of the new Ministry, inregard to which the Parliamentary majority was not consulted. The appointment of Admiral Lindman to be Minister for Foreign Affairs is especially criticised. Sir E. Howard reported on 30th March that the parties of the Left, would not support a Cabinet which, includes Admiral. Lindtnan, but their attitude has since been, modified, in the sense that they have decided, to co-operate with lire ( lovermneht until, the general election in September, provided that a reasonable agreement is forthwith concluded with England, and that; no extreme measures are proposed in connection with, expenditure on national defence. Admiral Lindman, receiving the foreign representatives on 3.1st March, informed His Majesty&apos;s representative that it was his intention to conclude the agreement with England as soon as possible. Sir E. Howard, in reply, laid stress on the importance of Sweden&apos;s speedily resuming navigation, in her own. interests. All. things and parties considered, His Majesty&apos;s representative is of opinion that, unless the new Government can speedily settle the several questions at issue with Great Britain, their tenure of office must be precarious.Replying to his communication on the subject, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has instructed Sir E. Howard to choose a suitable moment for intimating to the proper quarters that there can be no question of re-opening discussion or negotiation with the Swedish Government in respect of the draft agreement, which represents a final and carefully-balanced compromise resulting from several weeks discussion. Furthermore, that there is no use in disguising the fact that the past attitude of the members of the new Swedish Ministry makes it; difficult to extend to them the confidence which His Majesty&apos;s Government felt when IVI. Wallenberg was at the Swedish Foreign Office. This being.so, even if the Swedish Government are prepared to accept the draft agreement as it stands, His Majesty&apos;s Government would now hesitate to do so until reassured of the sincerity of SwedeiFs intentions by some-concrete manifestation of goodwill. They would expect, as such, the equitable settlement of the Kogrund passage question, the resumption of Anglo-Swedish traffic-by Swedish shipping, and reasonable facilities for the Russian transit trade. Without the first two essential requisites, indeed, the proposed agreement would be of no effect, since the British Government would not be in a position to afford the facilities, which it prescribes, for the transport to Sweden of goods from the United Kingdom, and from overseas.
The trunk removed from the S.S. &quot; Frederick VIII.,&quot; containing Swedish official -and diplomatic correspondence, has been handed over to the Swedish Legation in London, after the removal therefrom, by a member of the Legation staff, of a considerable quantity of letters which, as he admitted, were not entitled to diplomatic immunity. 01: these letters, fourteen bank advices, referring to credits for&apos; enemy interests, have been detained. Sir E. Howard has been instructed to convey an expression of His Majesty&apos;s Governments extreme surprise that the privileges of -diplomatic despatch bags should continue to be thus abused by the Swedish -authorities in the face of the numerous complaints that have already been made on the subject.DENMARK.Sir 1.1. Paget reports that the bad impression, recently created by unfavourable -criticism of Denmark in the &quot; Morning Post &quot; has been,  completely  removed by Lord Robert Oecits speech  in, the House of: Commons, which has given great satisfaction.His Majesty&apos;?, representative draws attention, a;; a matter of urgent importance, to the fact that the correspondents in the United -Kingdom of a Danish butter-exporting linn have recently either refused to accept shipments or offered prices far lower than the Danish market rates, on the ground that they have plentiful supplies of the colonial article. The rejected butter was sent to Great Britain in Danish ships ; the price which the shippers expected to get for it was about 1*35 crowns, a figure con-siderably lower than that offered, by the German and Swedish buying organisations on the spot. Sir R, Paget insists that, under these conditions, it is impossible to.expect any further support from. Danish farmers for our policy of reducing the export of Danish produce to Germany. That country, he observes, is prepared to take the whole of the Danish output, not only during the war, but for some years after, and to relieve the farmers of all trouble and expense in the matter of: transport. Lie therefore urges that remedial measures be applied without delay, so that the arrangements be not stultified whereby we have bound the Danes to allot a definite proportion of their produce to Great Britain, The establishment of a British buying agency at Copenhagen appears to be urgently required, inasmuch as enquiries instituted on this side justify the belief that there is every prospect of all Danish supplies being taken in Great Britain, at prices considerably higher than, those paid for colonial butter.SPAIN.In compliance with the request of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, the Spanish Government have agreed to suspend their new regulation, concerning ships carrying iron ore to the United Kingdom (vide last Report) in the case of all vessels that had. sailed from England before tire publication of the order ; they have also agreed to deal with special cases on their merits. They point out, however, that their intention, to issue this order had been, communicated to the British Government early in March -and had evoked no objection. Sir A. Hardinge recommends that a modus vivendi on the questions of coal and iron ore should be arranged with the Marquis de Cortina, pending the conclusion of the general negotiations concerning Anglo-Spanish trade.PORTUGAL.The Portuguese Government have accepted (3rd April) the financial arrangements and conditions proposed by the British Government in connection with their purchases of wheat.Senhor Afonso Costa, after visiting Madrid (where he had audience with the King) proceeded on 3rd April to France.   He has a son serving at the front,CHINA.The Allied representatives at -Peking have concurred in defining the scope and effect of the complete and effective rupture with Germany, which is expected of the Chinese Government. It involves (1) declaration of war, (2) abrogation of China&apos;s treaties with Germany and Austria in regard to Customs tariff and Boxer indemnities, (3) internment or expulsion of enemy subjects, (4) liquidation of German anil Austrian &apos;&quot;: -1 &quot; &quot; &quot;      .   0
concessions, in agreement with the Allies, (5) sequestration of German firms, (6V requisition of enemy ships, to be either sold or leased to the Allies, and (7) settlement of outstanding claims presented by the respective Allied Legations.In discussing the financial and other advantages to be conceded to China upon her complete and definite rupture with Germany, certain of the Allied representatives-are not wholly in agreement with the policy, advocated by His Majesty&apos;s Minister and his Japanese colleague, of treating China, frankly and liberally. Mr. Alston reports, that at a meeting of the Allied representatives on the 1st of April, the Russian Minister (without instructions from his Government) put forward a proposal that, instead of suspending the Boxer indemnities (in which Russia has an interest of 29 per cent.), the Allies should give China a special loan &quot; on the most advantageous-terms possible.&quot; The attitude of the Russian and French Ministers, supported generally by their Italian and Belgian colleagues, indicates, in fact, their desire to-drive a hard bargain with China and to keep her firmly under financial control. The-Japanese Minister, whilst cordially supporting Mr. Alstons opinion that we should treat China magnanimously if we seek her co-operation in the war, was compelled by his instructions to stipulate for the abolition of China&apos;s export duty on. raw cotton, in return for making the 5 per cent, import tariff effective. This stipulation was-accepted, subject to reference, by all the Ministers. As regards the indemnities, it was finally agreed to recommend, as a compromise, that the payments should be suspended but should be repaid with interest, either before en at the end of the war, from the proceeds of a loan to be made by the Chinese Government with the assistance of the Allied Bowers. The Russian, French. Belgian and Italian Ministers are more-over in favour of waiting for China to make the first move, but Mr. Alston hopes that it may be possible by representations at Paris, Rome, and Havre, to secure a greater-measure of support for a broad minded view of the question.MEXICO.In. reply to his request for instructions as to His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy towards SeSor Carranza, Mr. Thurstan has been instructed. (30th March.) for the-present to conform his attitude to that of the United States Ambassador.Mr. Thurstan reports that, since December there have been three shipments of munitions of war to Mexico from San Salvador. Heavy payments have been made for them by the Mexican Government, in addition to the wireless plant which (according to the San Salvador Minister in Mexico City) was given in exchange for-the first shipment.The railway to Vera Cruz has again been seized and taken over by the Mexican authorities, on the pretext that the Government desire to guarantee a good service of ordinary and military trains. His Majesty&apos;s Minister considers it inadvisable to enter a protest, as the railway company&apos;s concession gives them no right to invoke diplomatic intervention.-    - CUBA.The Government forces have retaken Guantanamo and defeated the rebels. - The-in.surreet.ion has now been quelled everywhere except in the district of Nipe Bay.BRAZIL.Sir A, Peel reports that the proposal lately mooted by His Majesty&apos;s Government to render certain financial assistance to Brazil, would be greatly appreciated, but that, in his opinion, the suggested amount of the proposed credit (1,000,000L), is not large enough to induce the Brazilian Government to spend money in settling financial claims. It might, he thinks, be used as leverage to obtain the settlement of certain outstanding questions which involve no money payments. He deprecates, on financial and economic grounds, the suggestion of the Treasury that the loan should, be used for the purchase of coffee.CHILE.Sir F. Strange, telegraphing from Santiago on the 29th March, stated that the Chilean Government will cancel the appointment of a German to be their Consul at Tampico (vide last Report).
UNITED STATES.The American flag was hoisted over the Danish West Indies at 4 p.in. on 1st April.His Majesty&apos;s representative at Washington was informed by the Secretary- of State on 30th March, that no one except the President himself knew what he proposed to say in his address to Congress, but everything pointed to the conclusion that. Mr. Wilson, would not allow himself to be influenced by the Pacifist agitators. A peace demonstration organised for the 20th had been countermanded by order of the Police. The Administration had received assurances of unmistakable loyalty from, ail parts of the country, including the Middle-West States. The Presidents message has since been received with enthusiastic approval by all classes.In view of the great and increasing demand for tonnage to cany coal to Prance and Italy and iron ore from Spain to the United. Kingdom, Pi.is Majesty&apos;s representative at Washington was instructed (28th March) to ascertain whether the United States Shipping Board would be prepared to place at the disposal of the Allies a certain, number of American merchantmen, preferably armed. lie was also directed to suggest that American ships might, be usefully engaged in carrying American coal to Atlantic bunker depots ; and that the United States Government should, wherever possible, adopt the general policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to regulation of the coal, trade. Air. Barclay (in the temporary absence of Sir C. Spring Rice) replied on the 29th that the Shipping Board&apos;s refusal to allow the chartering of American ships for British service was due to the British Governments insistence upon American shipowners signing bunkering agreements, which are held to be opposed to United States laws, especially in so far as they preclude the carriage of goods to or from black-listed firms. The President, of the Board, expressed his desire to render the assistance required, provided the legal difficulties of the bunkering agreements can be overcome.GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.In reference to the complaint of Norwegian shipowners, recorded last week, that the Bergen-Lerwick route is inadequately protected by His Majesty&apos;s Navy, Sir M. Findlay has been instructed to point out that its dangers will be greatly minimised if ships will follow the instructions given them, as to leaving the coast at dusk and proceeding to fixed rendezvous. The portion of the route through which vessels should thus pass during daylight is regularly patrolled, but experience shows that they frequently ignore these sailing directions.The Norwegian Government have entered a protest, in reply to the German Note proclaiming the new danger zone in the Arctic Ocean, and have pointed out that this zone begins at a three miles limit from coast islands or entrances to narrow fjiords, whereas Norway claims a four miles limit.The German Government have offered unmolested passage for all Norwegian ships leaving Great Britain for Norway on 1st May, provided that they undertake, either to remain in Norway or to abstain from further trade with Allied countries.Complying with a special application by the Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association, His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed (31st March) to allow Norwegian vessels loaded or loading in the United States prior to 1st April with, cargoes for Denmark to proceed, on. the understanding that, after completing these Danish voyages, they shall be free for Norwegian trade. This concession involves a stipulation that the charters of all vessels not loaded or loading at that date shall be cancelled. On 1st April, His Majesty&apos;s representative at Washington reported that large quantities of cereals and fodder for Denmark are awaiting shipment at Baltimore, New Orleans, and other southern ports, and that no Danish ships are available to transport them, lie therefore enquired whether His Majest,y&apos;s Government would consent to their being shipped in Norwegian vessels. On the previous day Sir R. Paget had. been instructed to make it clear to the Danish Trade Office and shipowners that facilities would in future be granted only for the shipment of Danish cargo to Denmark in Danish vessels.The Director of the Holland Steamship Company&quot; informed Sir W. Townley (2nd April) that, since the sinking of the &quot; Amstelstroom &quot; by German destroyers, it is no longer possible to induce captains and crews to sail, unless escorted. His Majesty&apos;s Minister, in submitting the Company&apos;s case, observes that it is the only
company in Holland which has steadily endeavoured to keep up trade with England and that it has lost a very large proportion of its tonnage.His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Rotterdam recently reported that 40 German ships were expected to arrive at that port in ballast from Bremen and. Hamburg to take coal to.Sweden and bring back iron and copper ores. One, the S.S. &quot;Ceres,&quot; left Rotterdam on 24th March on this service, and it is alleged that she was escorted within the limits of Dutch territorial waters by German submarines. Sir W. Townley has addressed an enquiry on the sub feet to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.The following communique was issued on 30th March to the Associated Press for publication in America, but not to appear in England : &quot; In answer to a question of a representative of the Associated. Press,. Sir Edward. Carson, First Lord of the British Admiralty, said.: &apos; The German statements are exaggerated, but none suggests that the submarine warfare does not cause very serious damage both to neutrals and belligerents. The losses, however, do not exceed the estimates on which we have based our policy, and after the most careful consideration, it is abundantly clear that the German hopes of starving us out are quite illusory. So far neutrals have suffered more from German methods than belligerents.&apos; &quot;GENERAL.The Vatican have published the text of a note addressed by the Bavarian Prime Minister to the Papal Nuncio at Munich, stating that, according to information received freih Berlin, the German Government are disposed to abstain from deporting any more Belgian workmen to Germany and to repatriate those who, possibly as the result of errors, have been unjustly deported.In view of the deep feeling evoked by the unqualifiable measures of the German Government, and of the anxiety of the families interested, the French Government, reversing their earlier decision, have decided to accept the German demand that prisoners of war shall not be employed within a. distance of 30 kilometres from the front.   They have informed the British Government accordingly.Circular instructions were telegraphed by the Foreign Office on 2nd April to His Majesty&apos;s representatives abroad, embodying the new rules for severely restricting the issue of passports for women and children, through the danger zones.Sir W. Townley reports that, in addition to 2,000 Russian Poles, there are large numbers of Austrian Jews (estimated at 60,000) prepared to undertake farm labour in the United Kingdom. He has reason to believe that they would be willing to work on war prisoners&apos; terms, on condition that, after the war, they may be provided with passage to North or South America.
