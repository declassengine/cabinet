SECRET.APPRECIATION  OE  THE ATTACHED   WESTERN  AND  GENERALREPORT No. II.France.The appointment of General Retain as Chief of the General. Staff at. the Ministry of War marks the definite ascendancy in the Councils of the French Government of the new Minister of War, AI, Painleve. The full effect of this most important development on the strategy of the whole campaign cannot yet be estimated...Greece.A definite decision as to the policy to be adopted by the Allies in. Greece cannot be deferred much longer. There are really only two possible alternatives. One is to&quot;, drift along, allowing the French, by a series of artificially provoked incidents, to bring matters to a crisis, as they undoubtedly mean to do. That policy7 has all the , disadvantages of ill. faith to Greece, in which we shall be equally7 culpable, with none of the efficiency which might possibly characterise French action if our Allies were not hampered by our scruples. The other is frankly to throw the whole responsibility for the conduct of Allied policy in Greece upon the French, at the same time stipulating that they should, exercise their power -with moderation. This policy Avould certainly have been impossible before the recent Franco-Italian, deal over Asia Minor (and possibly- Epirus), but it may not be impossible now providing always that the Franco-Italian agreement does not break down. It would enable us to disentangle ourselves from the Greek imbroglio, and whatever may be said about French policy in Greece, any policy must be more efficient than the resultant of several conflicting and incoherent policies.Meanwhile, the real focus of disturbance is the great Thessalian wheatfield already  nearing the harvest. If King Constantine&apos;s Government can get in the crop it is independent of all pressure by blockade till the end of the year, and only direct military operations can bring it to terms. The temptation to General Sarrail to seize it and the Greek inducement to fight for it are equally strong. The situation is essentially the same as when Admiral Dartiges de Fournet demanded the surrender of the Greek arms on 1st December. Hitherto, however, General sarrail&apos;s coups have always shown a measure of careful preparation ami an adequacy of means employed which were singularly lacking in the French. AdmiraPs ill-starred adventure.German Affairs.It is becoming increasingly7 evident that the German   Socialist Party, in . its advocacy of &quot; peace without annexation,&quot; is working hand in glove with the German Government, which fully realises that a peace on this basis would be a far greater, success than anything it has hoped for since the Marne.
Sweden.Sir E. HowarcTs latest telegrams emphasise the danger, anticipated in the Appreciation to Western Report No. 13, that a breakdown in the negotiations for the proposed agreement as to the mutual release of shipping, or a misunderstanding arising out of the negotiations, may be used by an essentially pro-German Government as a lever to swing Swedish public opinion generally against this country.Spain.Senor Maura&apos;s references to Gibraltar and Tangier, as contained in the very brief telegraphic summary, sound distinctly truculent. German propaganda in Spain, not content with bringing about Count Romanones&apos;s downfall and preventing Spain from ranging herself on the side of the Allies, would seem to be passing over to the offensive.United States.The general attitude both of the President and of the public seems, judging by Mr. Bailouts telegrams, to be thoroughly satisfactory. The process of improvising the organisation for war is being carried cut rapidly, and President Wilson&apos;s mind would also seem to be adapting itself easily to the new environment,L. S.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND  AFRICA.IM PEIilAL C.conference.A. Resolution of the Imperial War Conference has been telegraphed to Australia which calls, attention to the importance of developing an adequate capacity of production of naval and. military material, munitions and supplies in all important parts of the Empire, including countries bordering on the Pacific and Indian Oceans.A further Resolution which was similarly telegraphed affirmed that the system of Double Income Taxation within the Empire called for review in relation to firms in the United Kingdom doing business with the oversea countries of the Empire, to individuals in the United Kingdom who have money invested in such countries -and to its influence on the investment of capital in the United Kingdom, the Dominions and India. The Conference urged that the subject should be dealt with by legislation immediately after the conclusion of the war.A Resolution dealing with Imperial Resources and the desirability of making the Empire independent of other countries in regard to food supplies and raw materials, &amp;o, was also telegraphed. This expressed approval of-&quot;the principle &quot; that each part of the Empire, having due regard to the interests of our-Allies, shall &quot; give specially favourable treatment and facilities to the produce and. manufactures &quot; of other parts of the Empire.&quot;The Conference also recorded its approval of arrangements to induce intending emigrants from the United Kingdom to settle in countries under the British flag.As to the control of natural&quot; resources and post-war economic policy, the Conference expressed, the opinion in. another Resolution, (telegraphed to Australia) that the safety and development of the Empire required prompt attention being given to the production and transportation of an adequate food supply, the control, -and economical utilisation of natural resources, and further, that it was desirable in order to prevent unfair competition during the transition period, after the war that the Governments should control the importation of goods from, enemy countries for twelve months after hostilities cease.Resolutions favouring the control, of wool production and. of ores and metals for the period following the war and welcoming measures to free the Empire from any dependence on German-controlled, production of non-ferrous metals and ores were similarly forwarded to the Commonwealth, as were others against the acquisition of mineral rights by enemy subjects. and on the necessity of the Empire becoming self-sufficing in meat supplies.A. request to the Imperial War Graves Commission to submit an estimate of the -cost of their work to the various Governments was the subject of: another Resolution.Other Resolutions dealt with the desire of the Conference to present an address to His Majesty the King, and. the acceptance by the Conference of the principle of reciprocity of treatment between India and the Dominions regarding immigration and the admission of visitors.CANADA.Owing to the urgent need, of further supplies of rails in. France, arising from the -advance of the British, forces, the Government of the Dominion have been asked if they can supplement the 300 miles of rails already furnished, by the provision of an -additional supply of about the same quantity. It is pointed out that transport could be available by the latter part of July.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has conveyed his gratitude to the Dominion. Government for the promise they have made to the Imperial Munitions Board to lend the sum of $10,000,000 for the purpose of helping forward the construction of wooden ships in Canada.As to the requisitioning of ships in course of construction in Canadian yards, the -Secretary of State has telegraphed in further explanation that this should, be limited
to vessels building for neutral owners. The matter is not the same with regard to-the Ahies.; and particularly with reference to Japan it is suggested that any ships building for&apos;that country should&apos; be taken over by negotiation, as compulsory measures might prejudice the arrangements whereby Japan is to supply to the-British Government a considerable number of vessels now under construction.The Secretary of State has telegraphed, in explanation of a previous com muni-cation&quot;:&apos;:, that the suggestion that the Dominion Government should appoint buying agents for avooI in Australia and New Zealand was made with a view that all wool&apos; I should be delivered for manufacturing purposes and not for retention and speculation. It is pointed out that the shortage of this commodity only permits of necessary trade,, and. the hope is expressed that military necessities will be given preference over civil, recpxirements in the same way that has been done in. the United. Kingdom.In reply the Dominion Government have agreed to appoint a Wool Commission to advise upon, the allocation of wool coming from Australia and New Zealand. The wool will be used, entirely for the purposes of manufacture, with military requirements having preference, and no speculative dealings will be allowed. Canadian Trade-Commissioners will be appointed at Melbourne and Auckland so that orders may be-given by them to the Australian Wool. Committees. The Canadian Wool Commission will approve the orders, and the Government will inform the Trade Commissioners as to the orders approved.The Governor-General has telegraphed that the Dominion Coal Company cannot guarantee the continued manufacture of steel unless the iron and limestone supplies are augmented. As further tonnage is wanted for this purpose, the release of a requisitioned vessel is suggested.The Secretary of State has pointed out that, owing to the necessity of all Atlantic vessels being made available for the transport of food and munitions, it is impossible-to continue to allow pulp, which contains considerable quantities of water, to be imported without taking into consideration the weight of the water in relation to the import licence. There is no discrimination against Canada involved in this decision,, though the practice hitherto followed has extended a preference to Canadian pulp.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.With further reference to replacing Argentine wheat by Australian&quot;!&quot; wheat the Prime-Minister of the Commonwealth lias been informed through the British Minister at Buenos Aires that this replacement is the only method of raising the embargo on British exportable wheat. The Australian Government have therefore agreed to divert to -the Argentine 200,000 tons from the 3,000,000 tons bought- by the-British Government.As the Commonwealth Government wish to make further advances to farmers for-wheat sold, they would be glad if the British Government would pay the balance due upon their purchases in weekly instalments of .1,000,000/,. each, beginning on-1st September.The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth &apos; has called attention to the fact previously notified that the Commonwealth and State Governments will extend precisely similar facilities to British soldiers as to Australian soldiers who desire.to settle on the land. It is pointed out that the arrangements for the settlement of soldiers are very generous, and an amount of 22,000,000L will be expended in this, direction. ,.With further reference - to the matter of advances:!: from the British Treasury to -enable the Commonwealth to make loans to the States, the Governor-General has. pointed out that the Commonwealth has only asked that the British authorities should agree to their advancing 3,000,000L to the States from tlie money which has been lent by the United Kingdom to the Commonwealth for war purposes.   It is observed that the moneys received in regard to the recent 3,500,000L loan have gone to replace the previous advances made to the States from the War Loan fund.   The advance of&quot; 3,000,000Z. now proposed would not involve so great a charge on the War Loan, fund as that which has been removed by the replacement already made.* See Western and General Report for the week ending 18th April 1917. t See Western and General Report for week ending 25th April 1917.X See Western and General Reports for weeks ending .28th March, 18th April and 25th April 1917.. .&apos;
NEW  ZEALAND.The Governor&quot;telegraphed on 25th April stating that the coal strike had concluded and that the men were returning to work that clay.In reply to an inquiry on the subject, the Secretary of State has informed the Government of the Dominion that there is now no cause for continuing the restriction upon the exportation of newspapers to the United States of America. The New Zealand authorities, however, suggest continuing the restriction for a further three months as it has been found that unauthorised communications have been sent in newspapers to the United States.At the municipal elections on 25th April the anti-militarists have been unsuccessful. In the election for Mayor of Christchurch the retiring occupant of that office (Mr. Holland) was re-elected by a majority of 6,700 over his opponent, who stood as an anti-conscriptionist.   A similar result occurred at Greymouth.SOUTH AFRICA.The Union Government are greatly concerned about the mortality amongst the natives employed in East Africa in military work. Out of 19,000 recruits 1,188 deaths have taken place up to 24th April last. From February to October last year the rate averaged 4 per 1,000, whereas it rose to 9 per 1,000 during the months of November 1916 and January 1.917, and to 13 for February and 21 for March. Owing-to these facts it has been found necessary to suspend recruiting and to arrange for a report to be made as to the distribution of natives in healthy or unhealthy places, the nature of their work, their rations, medical attendance, hospital accommodation, &amp;c. Enquiry is also desired regarding the embarkation of so many sick natives on the &quot; Aragon,&quot; when 130 died en route, and 36 deaths occurred within five days of landing at Durban. The Union Government wish that this matter may be brought before the Army Council, and that the investigation may be thorough. It is pointed out that Europeans in the Union are not, unanimously in favour of the employment&apos; of natives for military purposes, and the Government feel that great care must be taken in looking after those natives who have loyally responded to the call for. assistance.EAST AFRICA PROTECTORATE.The Secretary of State has informed tiie Officer Administering the Government that he does not object to compulsory service for natives, but before agreeing he wishes to know if the military authorities consider it advisable, and to be assured that the proposed course will not lead to native unrest.In reply to the inquiry about the transfer of employees, the Secretary of State has &apos; telegraphed that he would, prefer legislation to follow the lines of the Munitions of War Act, 1915, which made it an offence for a new employer to give employment rather than for an employee to leave his work.HONG KONG.The Governor proposes to raise the assessed taxes (except with regard to the poorer villages) by 7 per cent, as&apos; a war tax for the duration of the war, and devote the proceeds (about 1,000,000 dollars) every year to the British Government, as a free gift.CEYLON.The Secretary of State has requested the Governor to prohibit the exportation of rubber and tin to all places except the United Kingdom. Shipments, however, to India, the Straits Settlements, and Hong Kong may be allowed if the Governor is satisfied they are for local use.Similar telegrams have also been sent to the Governors of the Straits Settlements and Hong Kong, the qualifications in the former case applying to shipments to India and Ceylon.. no2962-1
PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.FRANCE.On the proposal of the Minister of War, the Council of: Ministers decided (30 th April) to re-establish the post of Chief of the General Staff at the Ministry&apos;of War.   The post was entrusted to General Retain.ITALY.Sir R. Rodd was instructed on the 27th April to address a strong remonstrance to the Italian Government for having permitted the &quot; Corriere della Sera &quot; to publish a despatch from its political correspondent in Rome, giving what purports to be a summary of the agreement reached at the recent Conference at St. Jean de Maurienne. This premature publication, being calculated to cause serious embarrassment to the Allied Governments (inasmuch as the agreement is subject to the assent of the Russian Government, which has not yet been consulted), Sir R. Rodd was directed to point out that any further indiscretions on the subject might make it impossible to continue these negotiations. On the 29th. lie replied that the Minister for Foreign Affairs deplored these Press announcements and had renewed his instructions to the Censor with great emphasis. At the same time the Minister expressed the opinion that the indiscretion in question, emanated from Paris, where there had been a noticeable lack of reticence on the subject.BELGIUM.The Relief Commission has been, in communication with the French, Belgian, and United States Governments with regard to the proposed American loan, of this,000,000 to be made for the entire financing of relief work. The Belgian Minister at Washington lias made an official application to the United States Government in. the matter. It is apparently assumed that means will eventually be found to induce the German Government to abstain from sinking relief ships, hut for the time being all sailings from America are suspended.GREECE.&apos;Replying to Sir F. Elliots observations on the imperative necessity of coming to an immediate understanding with the French for the purpose of united and concerted action In Greece, the Foreign Office has informed him that a detailed statement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments views has been prepared for communication, to the French Government, for the purpose of eliciting a definite declaration of their policy. It is clear, however, that some time will be required for the complete discussion (in Paris) of the various questions at issue ; pending their settlement and. further instructions, His Majesty&apos;s Minister has been directed to avoid, if possible, an audience with, the King of Greece, and in any event to maintain a non-committal attitude.Recent negotiations between the Allied Governments on the Asia Minor question have led to a declaration by Baron. Sonnino, communicated to the Foreign Office by the Italian Ambassador on the 30th April, that, if the agreement concerning Asia Minor breaks down (that is to say, if Italy should fail thereby to secure the share of Asia Minor, which she claims) he would be compelled to withdraw his assent to the proposed policy in Greece. From this the inference is drawn by the Foreign Office that the French and the Italians have come to a separate and secret arrangement on the Asia Minor question, as has indeed been suspected on other grounds. Lord Robert Cecil informed the Italian Ambassador that in any event the proposed policy in Greece is, if anything, French, and that Great Britain has no desire to adopt a violent policy in that country.The British representative on the Allied Military Commission has recorded his opinion that the military requirements of the Allies&apos; ultimatum have been practically fulfilled ; also, that the Army of the East is now in no danger of attack by the Greeks, unless there should be a Venizelist advance on the mainland, or a seizure of crops in
Thessaly or a French occupation. The count of rifles in the Morca has been, concluded. It shows a total of 311,000, or 7,000 more than the Greek Governments estimate. In this connection Sir F. Elliot advises that the Military Control should forthwith be called upon to report whether the conditions of the ultimatum have been fulfilled ; also, that the blockade should be raised without further delay, as famine is imminent.J. M. Venizelos entirely approves of the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government toallow Greece to be supplied with wheat from India, a plan which he has always advised. He hopes eventually that the Provisional Government may be able to make their own purchases, independently of Athens. The torpedoing of the &quot; Nesfcos &quot; has made it evident that Greece cannot Lie provisioned from the United States. With regard to the coming harvest, Sir F. Elliot considers that the reports circulated by Salonika concerning the sinister designs of the Athens Government (ride last Report) are exaggerated, but. he admits that the Government intend to requisition as much of tire crops as possible, a measure which Lord Granville considers undesirable. Sir F. Elliot estimates that Royalist Greece might exist for seven months on the home crops, if the total production were requisitioned and evenly distributed. The only districts which produce wheat in quantity exceeding local consumption are Thessaly and Aria. According to a despatch of Lord Granvilie (30th April) M. Venizelos is extremely anxious to lie permitted to take forcible measures for safeguarding tlie Thessalian harvest without further delay. He urges that it would be grossly unjust to allow the Athens Government to take possession of it, but that to prevent their doing so there must be a temporary occupation of Thessaly by Allied or Venizelist troops, or both. On 1st May His Majesty s Minister reported that the Allied Board had suggested that the Allied Governments should, purchase the surplus wheat and maize crop in Thessaly for the use of the army in Macedonia. Sir F. Elliot, endorsing the suggestion, observes that the negotiations with the Greek Government would have to be confidential ; but he sees no other effective solution unless it be military occupation, to which he is opposed on political grounds. A Decree has been published prohibiting the sale of wheat, barley, rye and maize except to the Government, who will fix prices. Lord Granville, telegraphing on the same day, expressed, the opinion that &apos;&quot;&apos; the French plan to seize the entire harvest of Thessaly for the Allied troops,&quot; of which he had just heard, might be politically preferable to allowing the Royalists to get it, but that it was even more unjust.His Majesty s Minister has been directed to consult with his French colleague in the matter of the reply to be made to the Greek Governments Note of protest against the occupation of the islands. This reply is to be in the nature of a statement of facts rather than a justification of the Allies&apos; action; the Foreign Office, in leaving its general tenour to Sir F. Elliots discretion, stipulates that it should not commit His Majesty&apos;s Government to anything which the Greek Government might invoke against us in connection with islands (other than Zante) occupied by Venizelists.There has been some further friction of a mild type at the Corinth Canal, which Sir F. Elliot considers may possibly have been caused by agents provocateurs. General Cauboue has suggested to the French Minister at Athens that he should, demand the dismissal of the military Commandant at Corinth ; the matter has been referred to Paris for instructions. rGeneral Cauboue considers that the French patrols should, be permanently assigned to the north side of the Canal and the Greeks remain on the south, a proposal which Sir F. Elliot approves, provided the Greek Government are duly notified.On 29th April, Sir F. Eiliot telegraphed a report, which had reached him from sources which lie had reason to regard as trustworthy, to the effect that the French authorities were contemplating a coup de main at Athens, involving the removal of the King and Royal family. His Majesty&apos;s Minister, much perturbed by this information, found confirmation thereof in the fact that Venizelists were being wan. ed to leave Athens&apos; and in alleged Royalist preparations for resistance, or reprisals. M. Bibot, to whom Lord Bertie mentioned the matter, characterised the report as absurd. He had promised. Mr. Lloyd George that the French Government would take no strong action against the King of Greece without consulting His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the promise would be kept.Notwithstanding the unanimous recommendation of the Military Control, General Sarrail has refused to allow 100 Greek seamen to remain.at Athens and 150 in Pirams for various services, including those of the Ministry of Marine. Sir F. Elliot considers this to be one of the worst instances of General San-and petty bullying of the Greeks.. .
sGERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.The Berlin correspondent of the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; makes the significant statement that &quot; the resolution passed by the Social Democrat Party will attain its &quot; object only in proportion as it affects public opinion in enemy countries.&quot; Evidently, the Chancellor is directly encouraging these Socialist activities, in order to familiarise the world with the idea of a German &quot; peace without annexation&apos;&quot; and with Germany&apos;s readiness to subscribe to the Socialist programme of a League of Peace and compulsory arbitration. The German Government have invited the Dutch Socialist Van Ivol and.others to travel to Stockholm, via Berlin, and are doing all they can to encourage the meeting of International Socialists at the Swedish capital.The ultimate value of the Social Democrats&apos; assurances and of the Governments tacit sanction of their activities may be gauged by the reception accorded by the German Press to the recent announcement, made by the Vienna &quot; Fremdenblatt,&quot; that Austria does not wish for any annexation, of Russian territory. The &quot; Vorwarts &quot; asserts that this declaration by Count CzerninS organ must be binding also on the German Government. All the leading newspapers which, reflect or interpret official opinion either endeavour (like the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;) to explain away this embarrassing statement of policy or (like Count Reventlow&apos;s organ) to attack it. The &quot;Vossische,&quot; after trying to explain it away, declares that Germany will not give up her conquered territory in the East unless Russia gives &quot;guarantees for nei gbbou riiness.&quot;A German, official Avireless of the 2Sth, repudiating the British Press report that German artillery has been reduced in efficiency because of the lack of raw materials for making explosives, observes, that after the solution of the nitre problem, the manufacture of explosives in unlimited quantities was assured. &quot; During the first &quot; months of the war there was a shortage of saltpetre, but Germany now produces &quot; artificially a larger quantity of nitrates than was imported from Chile before the &quot; Avar. There is therefore enough not only for the making of explosives, but for &quot; purposes of agriculture. Cotton has been replaced by cellulose. Glycerine can P also be produced to the amount required, since it is no longer extracted^from &quot; rats^ but from other materials of which unlimited quantities exist.&quot;In a reA-ieAv of recent submarine operations by the Reichstag in Committee, much satisfaction was expressed, at the details given by the Secretary for the Navy of the increased production and activity of U boats. As regards the supply of oil, he declared that the Government had a stock in hand sufficient for large warships as Avell as submarines.The Radical Liberal Party in recent convention passed a resolution, expressing &quot; profound indignation at President Wilson&apos;s presumptuous aspersions on German character and public institutions.&quot; The Convention further testified to &quot; the unanimous concord of the whole nation, tested in the fierce storm of war.&quot;There have been many indications of great official and unofficial uneasiness as to the possibility of serious disturbances on the 1st of May. Of these the most importantfis the internaleAudence contained in General GroneFs impassioned appeal to all patriotic Germans to assist him by enlightening their fellow workers concerning the needs of the Fatherland. Asa matter of fact, however, according to the German wireless, 1st May passed off in complete tranquillity.Sir PI. Rum bold reported on 30th April that no German newspapers had been receiA^ed at Berne for three days and that the Federal Government had no news of the situation which would account for the stoppage.SWITZERLAND.The question of Switzerland&apos;$ reserved rations and export of &apos; attle have been discussed by M. Denys Cochin Avith M. Grobet, who came to Paris f? c the purpose, at M. Cochin&apos;s invitation, on 26th April. Resulting from these negotiations, a draft agreement Avas concluded on 30th April and submitted byr the SavIss and Italian delegates for the approval of the Governments. Briefly stated, it provides for certain supplies of oil cake to be delivered by Italyr to Switzerland at specified dates, also for railway transit facilities, and an additional ship for transport of oil-cake, via France. Switzerland undertakes not to export more than 20,000 head of cattle to other than -
Allied countries from 1st May to the end of the year. If more cattle have to be exported for want of fodder, the Allies will have the option either of buying&apos; them at current rates or supplying fodder for their maintenance. Other articles in the agreement refer to the supply of timber, condensed milk, cheese and butter to the Allies.Recent rationing returns show that calves in considerable numbers continue to be exported from France to Switzerland.    The Foreign Office have requested Lord   -Bertie to ascertain the facts and. their explanation.HOLLAND.A recent despatch from Sir W. Townley slates that whilst optimism, prevails at the Dutch Foreign Office, there is a great deal of uneasiness in business circles in Holland, and especially at Rotterdam, in regard to the possibility of war with Germany. Military and other precautions have been taken by the Government to provide against all eventualities. Sir W. Townley observes that it may possibly be Germany&apos;s aim to create this feeling of uneasiness in the hope that Great Britain may thereby be led to divert from her reserves for the Western front a force sufficient to come to the assistance of Holland in case of need.SWEDEN.Sir E. Howard had audience with the King on the 20th April; His Majesty was unusually cordial and expressed himself as most anxious to come to a settlement with Great Britain. He could not understand, however, the motive of His Majesty&apos;s Government in continuing to detain the Swedish grain ships when the Swedish&apos; Government were prepared to give the most formal assurances in regard to the release of British ships from the Baltic. His Majesty&apos;s Minister endeavoured tactfully to explain the difference between releasing a ship and giving a promise to do so. On. the following day the Minister for Foreign Affairs embodied the Governments formal proposals in a communication to Sir E. Howard, Briefly stated, they stipulate for the iirmjetlrate release of all Swedish calling vessels in United Kingdom ports and at Bayonne/&quot;in return for a formal assurance for the uninterrupted passage of 90,000 tons of British, timber-laden shipping through the Kogrund Channel, with Swedish protection, through territorial waters. The Swedish Government hoped that the arrangement might be accepted at once, so that the released Swedish ships might profit by the German Governments offer of a safe conduct on 1st May. On the 30th Sir E. Howard was authorised to inform the Swedish Government that so soon as he had received their formal undertaking with regard to the release of the British ships ^from the Baltic, His Majesty&apos;s Government would at once release all Swedish calling vessels held in United Kingdom ports, so far as there is no objection to their cargo.In this connection Sir E. Howard has drawn the attention of the Government to the extreme importance, from the political point of view, of taking no steps which might be interpreted as bringing pressure to bear on Sweden by withholding her genuiue requirements of grain for purposes and on grounds not directly connected with our blockade of Germany. He fears that unless the Swedish people are positively assured of getting their necessary supplies, all the political ground which we have won will be lost at one stroke, and. the growing irritation of the country, hitherto directed to our advantage against the late Prime Minister and his Government, will be turned against England. The Swedish Government have been assured of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention to allow Sweden to import her cereals in a condition for human consumption within a definite period, and any modification, of this under-standing would certainly- be regarded as a breach of faith and strengthen the position of the pro-German party. Replying to these observations, the Foreign Office has informed Sir E. Howard that as regards further releases of grain ships, arrangements will be made to allow the balance required by Sweden, (about 80,000 tons) to go forward gradually and&quot;to meet Sweden s urgent requirements, either from lialifax or from the United Kingdom, provided that the passage of British ships proceeds expeditiously from the Baltic and that they arrive safely in Norwegian ports. Thus, by the time the last British ship &quot;reaches a Norwegian port, Sweden&apos;s entire wheat requirements will have been allowed to proceed.With a view to meeting Russia&apos;s immediate requirements and to avoid congestion at Swedish ports, Sir E. Howard has suggested that the Swedish Government should be allowed to purchase a certain portion of. all such goods in transit to Russia as they2902-1 C
may require, on condition that they shall issue licences at once for the remainder&apos;. His Majesty&apos;s Government favour the adoption of this arrangement, hut, before approaching the Swedish Government, have requested Sir G. Buchanan to sound the Russian Government in the matter. .There was a mild military demonstration, apparently of&apos; Socialist sympathies, at Stockholm on the 25th April, in which men of the Mounted and Foot Guards Regiments took part. Sir E. Howard regards these demonstrations more as a sign of general discontent than of any definitely organised movement. On the 28th, the Press published an appeal by the leaders of all political parties, calling on the Swedish people to display discipline, courage, and self-sacrifice for the country&apos;s good.DENMARK.There is a movement on foot, similar to that which has been carried out in Sweden, to send Danish delegates to the United States with a view to securing a continuation of imports, including cattle fodder. To prevent a conflict of counsels and policies in blockade matters, Mr. Andersen advises Sir R. Paget that it would be well for Great Britain, in concert with the United States Government, to discourage these missions.On the 25th April the Foreign Olhce directed His Majesty&apos;s Minister to make very serious representations in the proper quarter with, reference to the increase of food exports to Germany shown by recent returns. On the 20th Sir C. Spring Rice was instructed to suggest to the United States Government that licences for cattle fodder export from America to Denmark should only be issued on the Danish Governments undertaking to continue to supply Great Britain with bacon at the pre-war percentage rate and to reduce her exports, of meat and cattle to Germany at least to pre-war figures.The butter qifestion continues to be vexed. Sweden having proposed to double her purchases of Danish butter, Sir R. Paget expressed the opinion that there would be no objection to the arrangement on the part of Great Britain provided that the amount involved were deducted from the German quota as well as from the British. Mr. &quot;^Andersen said that this would be impossible and he reminded His Majesty&apos;s Ministerthai the proposal was intended to be of benefit not only to Sweden but to the Danish exporters, whose shipments to England had not yet been taken up or paid for (vide last Report). The Danish Government must evidently be placed in a very difficult position if England will neither buy the produce herself nor allow it to be sold to anyone else.Sir R. Paget learns that the recent visit of the Danish King to the Swedish Court is likely to result in the Swedish Governments adopting a policy more in conformity with that of His Majesty&apos;s Government; also that after the meeting of the Scandinavian Ministers at Stockholm&quot;(9th May) the three Kings will probably meet at Christiania.Recent public speeches made in England regarding the shortage of food supplies have been reproduced in the Danish tress, in consequence of which, reports are being actively spread that Great Britain cannot hold out till harvest time. Sir R. Paget observes that statements which are &quot;probably intended to make the British &quot; public less wasteful are liable to be construed here as indicating real distress, and &quot; are therefore not to our interest.&quot;The Danish Government has put forward a demand, for compensation from the German Government for two produce ships sunk outside the proclaimed zone. The Minister for Foreign Affairs believes that it -will be paid.SPAIN.On 26th April the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty&apos;s Charge ^d&apos;Affaires that the Spanish Government would forthwith rescind the 3o per cent, coal freight order if the British Government would allow the seven Spanish vessels now detained in England to return to Spain before 1st May with cargoes of coal;- this permission to be unconditional and.without guarantee that the vessels in question Avould return to England with iron ore. The Minister practically acknowledged that this proposal was the result of an arrangement -with Germany. As to the Cortina agreement (which was accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the form proposed by M. de Cortina), the Spanish Government now take exception to it as being too specific and binding; moreoA*er, they say that, as a commercial treaty, it can only
&quot;be ratified by the Cortes, which means that it will be subject to attack and endless discussion. Under these circumstances, His i\iajesty&apos;s Government directed Mr. &apos; Vaughan to state that no obstacles would be placed in the way of the departure of the Spanish ships, provided that the 33 per cent, condition were forthwith rescinded, pending ratification of the Cortina agreement. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Mr. Vaughan on the 27th that a Royal order suspending the 33 per cent, condition was being prepared, but his general attitude was unsatisfactory -and clearly reflected, the increasing weight of German influence on the Spanish Government. In connection with the release of the Spanish slops, His Majesty&apos;s Government requested from the Spanish Ambassador in London (on the 30th) a written undertaking that not only would the 33 per cent, order be rescinded at once, but that no fresh regulations would be made to prevent the free loading and sailing of all ships trading with the Allies, pending the conclusion of negotiations on the Cortina agreement. On the following clay Mr. Vaughan reported, after a conversation with&apos; the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the Spanish Governments intention was not to rescind the 33 per cent, order, but only to suspend it, and that if the present negotiations failed, any vessels released in the meanwhile would be bound by the guarantees required of them. The Minister also hinted that the Government would endeavour to replace the Cortina agreement by an exchange of Notes.The increasing influence of the forces hostile to the Entente, and particularly to Great Britain, may be gauged by Senor Maura&apos;s speech in the Bull Ling at Madrid on 29th April, when he declared that not only was Spain deprived of the command of the Gibraltar Straits (vital, to her position in Morocco), but that her sovereignty was diminished by Eugland&apos;s not; allowing her to be supreme on her own coasts and. waters. The internationallsation of Tangier was an annulment of all concessions made to the rights of Spain in Morocco, lie did not consider it true that the war was being fought for liberty or for the suppression of- militarism, since military predominance on the sea was just as great an evil as on land. Air. Vaughan has reason, to believe that the German Military Attached propagandist campaign has had a marked effect in official circles and led many to believe that Germany will be victorious in the end.A. new Democratic Ministry has been formed under Senhor Alfonso Costa, who retains his position as Minister of Finance. There is no change in the Ministries for War a]id of Foreign. Affairs.The Portuguese &quot;Minister in London, on behalf of Senhor Costa, has proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should grant Portugal a loan of 2,6OO,O00L upon the security of the German ships already handed over ; this credit would be used to pay for wheat pmrchased through the Commission. The Foreign Office has directed Sir L. Carnegie to intimate that His Majesty&apos;s Government are favourably considering, in the first instance, the issue of a loan of 1,600,0001., as originally proposed ; they assume that the security offered will be completed by the delivery of the eight or nine ships still due to Great Britain.Senhor Costa&apos;s recent visit to Madrid, where he had interviews with the King and various Spanish statesmen, has formed the subject of much comment and some misgivings in the Portuguese Press. Dr. Costa is reported to have discussed possible future agreements, dealing with commerce and communications, between Spain and Portugal. A section of the Portuguese Press displays considerable apprehension in regard to the proposed commercial agreement, realising that it would mean the economic penetration of Portugal, by Spain, which would naturally be followed by penetration financial and then political. Sir L. Carnegie, in a recent despatch to Sir. Bailout (No. 38), says that there are certain Germanophil elements in . Spain which, under the pretence of forming an Iberian Union and freeing Portugal from all -alien influences, are really working against the position of Great Britain.Urged by the United States to declare war against Germany without further delay,&quot; but fearful of a successful German offensive against Russia, the Chinese Government rare still hesitating as to their policy.   The Military Governors assembled at Peking, -after witnessing an exhibition of the Battle of the Somme war pictures at His Majesty&apos;sPORTUGAL.CHINA.
Legation, met in. conference on the 25th and voted practically unanimously for war.. On the 27th, however, the Cabinet conveyed, to Mr. Alston an intimation of their doubts and fears, plainly showing that they are greatly exercised in mind by the situation in Russia. At the same time they enquired of the United States Minister whether.China would participate in the financial assistance which America is giving to the Allies. President Li, who is not yet entirely converted to the Allied cause, fears that too sudden a declaration of war may give undue ascendancy to the military party, besides dislocating trade. All things considered, it is by no means certain that the Premiers war policy will command in Parliament the majority that voted for the rupture of relations. Under these circumstances, the Foreign Office have instructed Mr. Alston, in his discretion, to make it known, to the Chinese Government that, if they now range themselves unconditionally on the side of the Allies, His Majesty&apos;;? Government have every intention of meeting G.hina&apos;s reasonable requests in a generous spirit. Sir C. Greene has also been instructed to suggest to the Japanese Government that, with a view to expediting matters and. reassuring the Chinese, they should authorise their representative at Peking to make a similar declaration.JAPAN.A report having been received by His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Government of Mexico were making a payment of 60,000 yen to Japan, and that this payment was for certain weapons of obsolete type sold by Japanese merchants to Mexico, Sir 0. Greene has been directed to represent to the Japanese Government that, in view of the unconcealed, hostility of the Mexican authorities to the Allies, it is most desirable that no export of munitions of war to that country should be permitted. Assuming that the Japanese Government may have some influence with Carranza, His Majesty&apos;s Government would also be grateful if they would direct their representative in Mexico to exercise it by expostulating with the de facto President.in view of the impending publication of the Enemy Trading Ordinance pro-mulgated by the Japanese Government, Sir C. Greene has been instructed to state -that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad to remove all Japanese names from their statutory list, for Japan as soon as possible; also, if. the Ordinance covers the liquidation or control of foreign firms engaged in enemy business, the names of these-firms will be removed from the list.SIAM.Mr. Dering repeats that the Russian Minister, a new arrival at Bangkok, considers that it is important to the interests of the Allies that Siam should be persuaded to break off relations with Germany, and has expressed himself accordingly to the Minister for Foreign. Affairs. He urges that a rupture would secure a number of German ships for the. Allies&apos; service and the dismissal of the Governments German employes. Realising Great Britahts predominant influence with tlie Siamese Government,, he has endeavoured to persuade -Mr. Dering to advise them in this sense. In reporting the matter, Mr. Dering observes that he sees no reason to alter his opinion, that the Siamese Government should be left a free hand, being the best judges of their own interests.BRAZIL.The Brazilian Government have issued a Decree proclaiming their neutrality during the state of war between Germany and the United States.   Sir A. Peel thinks-that this unexpected, announcement may be due to the Presidents desire to leave-Congress (which meets on 3rd May) to make the final decision in regard to BraziFs-policy and position.Sir A. Peel, reported on 25th April, that the Brazilian Government had been greatly annoyed by the delay which had arisen in regard to the departure of the German Minister and Iris Staff owing to conflicting instructions issued by the British and French Governments in the matter of the port of call and destination named in the Allies&apos; safe-conduct. (The French Government had approved of Cadiz as the port of destination, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree.)   it was eventually
arranged that the &quot; Rio de Janeiro,&quot; conveying [he Minister, should sail for a Scandinavian or Dutch port, calling at Dakar for examination. On the 27th, however, Sir A. Peel reported that the Brazilian Government had decided that the Minister and his Consular Staff should go by rail to the frontier of: Uruguay, from which country it was believed they would go to Chile. German interests in Brazil have been taken over by the Dutch Minister.BOLIVIA.The safe-conduct issued by His Majesty&apos;s representative at La Paz for the repatria-tion of the German Minister via Buenos Aires was made valid for two months^ a term which the recipient considered much too short. It is generally believed that he will elect to remain in. South America, probably at Santiago de Chile.CHILE.The Chilean Minister in London has communicated a Memorandum to the Foreign Office explaining the nature and purpose of the replies made by the Chilean Government to the United States ami to Brazil, in regard to their respective notifica-tions of a state of war and of rupture with Germany. Chile regards the action taken by these States as a natural corollary to the protest which they, in common with Chile, made against Germa&apos;ny&apos;s submarine warefare. Had Chile&apos;s sovereignty suffered, she would have taken, similar action&quot; ; she will follow their example hereafter should she sutler treatment of the same kind as these States received. She has entered, into no neutrality agreement with Germany and will demand respect for her rights wheresoever attacked.MEXICO.On 28th April Mr. Thurstan reported that the situation at the Tampico .oilfields had become very serious. A strike of the Mexican Eagle and other companies&apos; employes, which began on the 16th, had assumed serious proportions; the strike leaders, abetted by the local authorities and police, were openly threatening the destruction, of property, which by Article 123 of the new Constitution they are legally entitled to do. Mr. Thurstan had reason to suspect German intrigues behind this strike, and that their object was to provoke active intervention by the United States Warship at Tampico. On the following day, however, the United States Ambassador had an interview with Seuor Carranza, whose attitude he found &quot;encouraging&quot; ; the President undertook to telegraph orders to Tampico for the protection of American lives and property.The United States Ambassador at Mexico City suggested (28th April) that the British and French Missions now at Washington should consult with the United States Government with a view to the adoption of a definite united policy towards Mexico. He also advised that Mr. Thurstan should go to Washington and explain the situation. Under instructions from Mr. Bait our-, Mr. Thurstan has accordingly proceeded to Washington, leaving the Commercial Attache in charge of the Legation.For the present, the policy of the United States is to avoid complications in Mexico by all possible means. The State Department has therefore instructed the American Ambassador to attend the official ceremonies of 1st May, but to do nothing in the way of further recognition. The&apos;State Department has instructed the Press in the United States to assist in establishing friendly relations with Carranza and to smoothe over or ignore unpleasant incidents.PANAMA.A definite ruling has. been&apos; conveyed by the Government at Washington to the Governor of the Panama Canal to the effect that the Canal is to remain neutral, and that Entente warships visiting ports in the Canal, zone will receive the same treatment as they did before the United Stater declared a state of war. 2962-1 D
GUATEMALA.By a decree of the 27th. April, Guatemala severed her diplomatic relations with Germany. The reason assigned lor this ,step is that the German Government not only gave no effect to the Republics protest against their methods of submarine warfare, but that they vouchsafed no reply thereto. The German Minister is given eight days to leave the country.CUBA.The unlawful shooting of twelve Jamaican British subjects by a body of Govern-ment troops under a Captain named Cardenas has been investigated and confirmed by the affidavits of British subjects resident at Jobabo, the scene of the outrage. Mr. Leech proposes to demand a suitable apology, the punishment of the guilty and due compensation for the families of the victims. In consequence of this incident, the arrangements made for the complimentary&apos; visit of a British warship to Havana have been cancelled.UNITED STATES.According to information supplied by the United States Ambassador in Russia to the Secretary of State at Washington and communicated by the latter to Mr. Balfour, suspicions have been growing at Petrograd with regard to the purposes of the British and French Missions, the idea being that they are negotiating independently of the other Allies and to their disadvantage. Mr. Lansing has sent a long telegram making it clear that these suspicions are utterly unfounded, and Sir C. Spring Rice suggests that the Foreign Office should communicate on the subject with the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires in London.In a communication addressed to the Prime Minister on 27th April, Mr. Half our gave a resume of the general situation, ami of the United States Governments energetic preparations for coping with the many and difficult problems arising out of their entry into the war. President Wilson, he observed, does not consider it expedient that the United. States should be bound to the Allies by any formal Treaty obligations, but having entered into the conflict, he means to see it through and put all his weight into it. In. avoiding any formal Treaties with the European Powers the President is acting partly in deference to popular sentiment and partly because he contemplates the possibility of one or other of the Allies showing themselves unreasonable in the final interpretation of their mutual Treaty- engagements, in which case the unfettered United States might exercise a powerful and beneficial influence. The State Department continues to entertain strong hopes of being able to induce Austria to make a separate peace with the Allies. There is much anxiety with regard to the situation in Russia; the President proposes to send a Mission to Petrograd with offers of advice and promises of assistance.A further communication from Mr. Balfour on the 30th April states that, making due allowance for delays caused by unpreparedness and by the inherent difficulties of the problems which confront the United States Government, their action has been prompt, liberal and effective. The policy adopted by the naval authorities has been particularly- helpful. They are doing everything possible to provide us with destroyers and convoying ships, relieving our Atlantic squadrons by the redistribution of their cruisers, and are evidently desirous of placing their forces ill European waters under British rather than French control. For the purposes of shipbuilding and armaments, the Government are prepared, if necessary, to commandeer the entire steel industry of the country.With a view to securing the utmost advantage of all available tank tonnage, His Majesty&apos;s Government have suggested to the United States Government an arrange-ment in the nature of a world tonnage pool, for the purposes of which it would be necessary for the Standard, and the Shell Oil Companies to come to a working agreement as to their respective spheres of interest and activity during the war. If the State Department favours the suggestion, it is proposed that the details of the agreement should be negotiated in London,
- His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador reports for the information of the Admiralty that Admiral ,T3rowniug&apos;s visit to Washington was a great success. By his unfailing taCt and courtesy he succeeded in establishing most satisfactory-relations with the United States naval authorities.Sir C. Spring Rice expressed the opinion on 28th April that the Conscription Bill (on which the Recruiting Bill depends) was likely to be passed by both Houses. One of: the results of conscription in the United States, he observes, will be that many persons will avoid it by crossing over into Canada.GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.The losses of vessels officially reported during the week ending 26th April was as follows : Steamships (500 tons gross and over) : British         -             -             - -       189,236 tons.Allied and neutral       - 10,477   ,,Sailing vessels (100 tons gross and over) :  British         -             -             - -          4,427 tons.Allied and neutral       -             - -        18,110   ,,Grand total -      228,250 tons gross.Total British losses, 193,063 tons gross. The total number of steamsrs sunk was - 51, the largest figure recorded since the new submarine campaign began. On the 27th April, Sir C. Spring Rice telegraphed that the United States Government had asked Mr. Balfour for the exact figures of tonnage destroyed by submarines and the latest estimate of future losses. The losses of British ships for the last seven days of April averaged 27,000 tons a day.His Majesty&apos;s representatives in Spain, Holland and Scandinavia have been directed to report, for the information of the Admiralty, as to the expediency of suggesting to the Governments to which they are accredited that they should consider the question of arming their merchant shipping. It is suggested that the attention of the Governments concerned should be drawn to the fact that no exception could properly be taken to their so doing on grounds of international law, inasmuch as there could be no question of their attempting thereby to evade a properly constituted blockade, but only to protect themselves from the unlawful depredations of the submarine, in reply, Sir E. Howard states that under existing circumstances, it appears to him to be useless to approach the Swedish Government on. the subject. Sir M. Findlay explains that the Norwegian Government have not armed their merchant fleet, though publicly urged to do so by the Mates&apos; Union, because they desire to avoid being forced into the war as long as possible. Banish and Dutch policy are similarly based on fear of Germany.The French. Government have accepted the British Governments proposal for a general reconsideration of the tonnage situation and they suggest that the Inter-Allied Committee in London should discuss the revision of existing agreements on the subject. The French Note emphasises the fact that it is not possible for France to supply coal to Italy.Sir C. Spring Rice recommends as a matter of policy that the United States be urged to restrict exports to neutral countries rather as a means of pressure, to induce them to place tonnage at the disposal of the Allies, than for the purpose of preventing foodstuffs reaching Germany. With this end in view he requests that he may be furnished with precise information as to the present situation in regard to neutral shipping.With reference to the congestion of cargoes awaiting shipment to Scandinavia at New Orleans, Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to explain to the United States Government that it is due partly to the measures taken by the British authorities with a view to securing surplus Norwegian tonnage for the Allies and partly to the attitude of the Swedish Government in the matter of the Kogrunds Channel. The settlement of both these important questions would be compromised if Great Britain were to abandon the leverage which is now exercised by refusing to allow facilities for Scandinavian vessels to bring cargoes from America until the desired ends have been obtained.29(52-1 y,
Mr- IX Brostrom, late Minister of Marine, and the largest shipowner in Sweden, has suggested to Sir E. Howard that, if regular traffic is to he maintained, Swedish ships trading with Great Britain must be convoyed. The sinking of the &quot; Atalanta&quot; had produced a very bad impression in shipping circles.Sir M, Fiiidlay reports that the German offer of a safe-conduct for Norwegian ships to leave the United Kingdom on 1st May has fallen flat, and its evident insincerity is severely criticised. The sailing conditions attached to the safe-conduct were published by the Shipowners&apos; Association of the 27th April. The Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed the German Minister at christiania of the negotiations now proceeding for the exchange of British for Norwegian ships in the North Sea trade. The Norwegian Government are advised that there is nothing in international law to prevent the chartering of Norwegian tonnage to British firms, so that, unless the German Government are looking for a easus belli, no harm could come of informing: them.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.On the 27th April an interview was published in the Stockholm. Press, giving the opinions of M. Troelstra, leader of the Dutch Socialist delegation to the International Peace Conference at Stockholm, lately arrived from Berlin. M. Troelstra was convinced that the Conference will attain its desired end. Austria, he declared, is ready to restore complete freedom to Serbia, and. Germany to make compensation to Belgium. When all the belligerents come to share the Russian Governments ideas (peace without annexations) there will be no further object in continuing the struggle. M. Brantirig, commenting, on these opinions in the &quot; Social Demokrateri,&quot; described them as premature and optimistic. He observed that the Central Powers have never accepted the so-called Russian Governments basis for peace terms ; also, that it was by no means certain that England and France would send delegates to the Conference. On the following day Sir E. Howard reported that the French Socialists had definitely declined to have anything to do with the Conference, which was therefore considered as abortive. He thinks it possible that M. Bran ting may endeavour nevertheless to keep in touch with the minority party of the German Socialists and with Austrian Socialists in the hope of being able to establish communication between them and the British and French groups.During an interview with the &quot; Social Demokraten &quot; on. 30th April, M. Huysmans declared that the International Socialists Bureau was working firstly to end the war on the basis of no annexations, and secondly, to secure a real peace -which will make an end of all war. The hope of concluding such a peace depended chiefly, he said, on whether the Socialists in Germany would compel the (German Government to state clearly that they renounced their plans for annexations in the West; The Hungarian Socialists also desire definite assurances on this point. England wanted no annexa-tions, but the question of Alsace-Lorraine was not ignored by the Socialist Congress.On 30th April a report was circulated in official circles at Petrograd that the German Emperor would publish a proclamation on 5th May in favour of a peace without annexations or contributions. Sir Robert Buchanan regards this more as intended to strengthen the Soldiers&apos; and Workers&apos; Committee and to increase the pressure of their demands on the Government for the opening of peace negotiations by the Allied Governments.GENERAL.A report has been, received from an official source that a recent article from &quot; The Times &quot; on the shortage of food supplies and the submarine peril has been reproduced, in Germany for the encouragement of the people, and that a million copies were&apos; circulated on 1st May. Sir R. Paget (Copenhagen) draws attention to the fact that all such utterances, either in the Press or in public speeches, are eagerly seized upon by the German Government as signals of Great Britahts distress, and he suggests the expediency of publishing articles, for reproduction abroad, which would proclaim the conn try&apos;s ability and determination to carry the war to a victorious conclusion in spite of the losses and inconvenience caused by the submarines.The German stipulations with reference to the employment of prisoners of war behind the lines have been accepted, and all German prisoners employed behind the
British. lines in France have been withdrawn to a distance of 30 kilometres from the front.Through the Netherlands Minister at Beidin, His Majesty&apos;s Government have received the German Governments reply to their enquiries on the subject of parcels for prisoners of war. The German authorities state that no measures have been taken or contemplated for the stoppage of such parcels, but that their examination has become more strict owing to the discovery of &quot; instruments of sabotage &quot; in French packages.&quot;The British Censorship has suppressed a &quot; Central News&quot; telegram from New York referring to the date of Mr. Balfours return to England, and it has been suggested to the United States Government that they should prohibit the despatch of such messages.A request has been submitted on behalf of the German Government by the Swiss Minister in London for the transmission of certain funds for the use of Germans interned in German colonies occupied by the Allies. In this connection Sir W. Townley has been advised by the Dutch representative at Berlin that a favourable answer would have a good effect in Germany, where he finds the authorities reasonably7 disposed and greatly influenced by the conviction that &quot; mutually fair-treatment of prisoners will do much to dispel bitterness after the war.&quot;
