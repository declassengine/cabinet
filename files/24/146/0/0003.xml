SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERAL&apos;REPORT No. 3.The Pacific Islands.It is evident from the replies of the Australasian Dominions to the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government for their assent to the giving of assurances to Japan as to her retention of the German Pacific Islands north of the Equator, that Australasian opinion has already discounted the obvious consequence of the Japanese occupation of these islands since 19.1.4. The real anxiety in Australia and New Zealand, no doubt, is not lest Japan should retain, the islands she occupies, but lest they should be asked at the Peace Conference to surrender any of the islands which they occupy.Internal Conditions in Geumany.The mainspring of the desperate anxiety of the Germans to firing the war to an end this year, which, inspires both the campaign of submarine &quot; frightfuluess &quot; and the efforts to get peace negotiations of any kind set on foot, is probably not so much the actual fear of starvation or of military disaster on a large scale, as the conviction that, if the strain is kept up much longer, Germany will, be unable to recover from it, materially or morally, after the war. The alternatives in their view are : a draw which will leave Germany capable of utilising to the full the control of her Allies, and the organisation of her own industries, which she has secured during the war, as a starting point for fresh conquests in industry, or if need be in war; and a draw which will ieave her as exhausted, in resources and will power as the Thirty Years War left her two-and-a-half centuries ago.Brazil.The motives of the Brazilian Government in protesting against the German submarine policy are not altogether clear. It is not looking for a pretext to seize German, ships in Brazilian ports as it is too afraid of losing the much larger value represented, in Germany&apos;s indebtedness to the State of San Paulo. Its chief object may simply be to play a prominent part among the South American States, but it is possible that it may really wish to earn some sort of claim to take part in an eventual Peace Conference, in that case &quot;its inllueuco is not unlikely to Lie exercised in support of German efforts to restrict British naval domination, which it is believed to regard as a greater menace to South American financial independence than German militarism.Mexico and Central America.The reports of German activities at Manzanillo and in San Salvador, and of the appearance of a German submarine in West Indian waters, are not very definite. But there can be no doubt that, in. the event of war between Germany and the United States, every effort will be made by. German agents to work up anti-American feeling in Mexico and Central America, and, if possible, to bring about a state of war which, would not only keep the United States occupied, but might enable Germany to establish, submarine bases in the Gulf of Mexico. Carranza&apos;s astounding note to neutrals, and the evident intention underlying it of depriving the Allies of their supplies of oil from Mexico, is apparently one of the &quot;first fruits of their endeavours,
United States.The situation has not developed in any definite direction during tlie last week. The President has firmly rejected the German attempt to induce him to depart from his standpoint and enter into negotiations which, in principle, would accept Germany&apos;s &quot; commercial blockade &quot; of the Allies. But, if he has not receded from his position, he has not moved forward either. The main body of American opinion is still determined to avoid. Avar if possible, and. it is only with the support of that main body that he means to move, if move he must. Even if he decides on. Avar, it will be with the intention, at any rate, of bringing about as soon as possible a peace on the lines of the peace advocated by him in his recent address to the Senate.L. S. A.15th February 1917.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.In view of telegrams received from Australia and South Africa, it.does not seem, possible that the Imperial Conference can meet until towards the end of March.From Press telegrams it seems practically certain that Mr. Hughes, the Prime Minister, will attend, and that he will be accompanied by a Liberal Member of. his War Ministry.CANADA.In response to a suggestion, from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Governor-General telegraphs that the Dominion Government are proceeding with the construction of 36 steel vessels of the trawler type and 100 wooden steam drifters.In order to secure as much as possible of the output of mercantile shipping from Canadian yards, the Shipping Controller has instructed his representative, who is in charge of a similar scheme in relation to the United States, to co-operate with the Imperial Munitions Board of Canada.A. UST R ALT AN COMMON W EALTH.From Press telegrams there seems now no doubt that Mr. Hughes will succeed in the formation of a Coalition Government consisting of an almost equal division of Liberals and Labour representatives. Mr. Tudor, who leads the. main body of the Labour party opposed to Mr. Hughes, has declined to join the other parties.  .The Commonwealth Government will raise and despatch 1,000 navvies as soon as possible, and will pay them the difference between ordinary British pay and the pay of an Australian private in the A.I.F.The Secretary of State for the Colonies has transmitted to the Commonwealth Government a telegram from Sir William Robertson stating that, owing to the extreme importance of the present year&apos;s operations, a sixth Australian division (with artillery or not) would be invaluable. This should be ready to take the field on the Western Front during July next.The Commonwealth. Government have intimated by telegram dated 10th February that they would not object to the retention by Japan of the Pacific islands she has captured from Germany north of the Equator. The Commonwealth assume, however, that the islands slightly south of the line, such as Nauru and the Ocean Islands, would be excepted.In order to ensure the greatest possible wheat crop for the season 1917-18, the Commonwealth Government and States have agreed to guarantee an advance to farmers of 3s. per bushel net for all f.a.q. wheat delivered at railway. The informa-tion that the British Government will purchase the crop on the same terms as the present crop will increase the sowing during the coming three months. It is suggested by the Commonwealth Government that the British Government should purchase crops for 19.18-19 and 1919-20.The Secretary of State for the Colonies has transmitted a telegram from Mr. Lloyd George to Mr. Hughes asking the Commonwealth Government, in view of the latest submarine menace, to release as many Australian coasting trade vessels as possible for ocean traffic by the employment of land transportor neutral ships. It is suggested that many neutrals who decline to trade in war areas would do so in districts free from war risks.NEW ZEALAND.The New Zealand Prime Minister has given a similar intimation to that of the Commonwealth GoA*ernment regarding the retention by Japan of the Pacific Islands north of the Equator.
SOUTH AFRICA.Having regard to the value oil the Native Labour Corps in France, the Army Council have conveyed to the South African Government their desire for 40,000 further native labourers. While the Union Government are unable to guarantee the supply of this number, they have agreed to procure as many as possible at the beginning of March. The Army Council have, in reply, pointed out the urgency of the matter.It is believed that recruiting prospects in Basutoland for the Labour Contingent would be improved, if the Chiefs were informed that the scheme is an Imperial and not a Union matter and that Basuto units, under Basutoland officers, will lie maintained in Europe.   One or two battalions of 2,000 each may thus be provided.The Union Government have promised to do their best to raise a unit of Cape Boys for horse transport purposes. They fear, however, that there are not enough qualified drivers available to recruit a mechanical transport unit.The Governor-General has informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies in a telegram dated 12th February that the following figures are given for the month ended 31st January : Contingents with Reinforcements as at 1st January 1917.---	Officers.	Men.	Nurses.Overseas   -	2S8	11,485	55British Bast Africa^	1.060	31,689	62Nyasaland and Central Africa	101	1.964 1	7Total	1,449	45,088                    124	*- 22 officers and&apos;851 other ranks Second South African Infantry Brigade were detached for temporary dnty witli. th e-Central African Forces.Besides the above, drafts for the several contingents have been despatched during January, totalling 13 officers and 818 other ranks.As to those undergoing training and ready for drafts, there are 5 officers and ] ,280 other ranks.&apos; Recruits for East and Central Africa are now only accepted for such units as mechanical transport, Engineers and Pioneers, and therefore the number enrolling for the South African Overseas Contingent has improved. It is believed that, for&quot; the quarter ending 31st March, 3,000 men will have joined.GOLD COAST.The Legislative Council have unanimously approved of the Government investing 500,0007. in the War Loan.GAMBIA.The Executive Council have advised the investment of 17,000?. in the War Loan.EAST AFRICA.The Church Missionary Society are desirous of taking over the work of the German Missions in German East Africa. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has informed the Society that&quot; as the future of the country is not assured, it is impossible to give them financial help. The desirability of their carrying on the work of the German missionaries is, however, recognised both by the Secretary of State and. the Administrator, and the latter considers that the Church of Scotland or the Church Missionary Society might usefully take over the Lutheran Missions in German East Africa.
MALAY STATES.The Secretary of State for the Colonies has informed the High Commissioner of the Malay States that the offer of Chinese skilled workmen cannot he accepted for this country owing to the attitude of the Trade Unions regarding imported coloured, labour, but that they could be employed in France, or in Bong Kong on ship-building, if a less rate of pay than that suggested (five dollars) can be proposed.JAMAICA.The Governor of Jamaica has telegraphed to instruct the Crown Agents to subscribe for 1Q0,QQQZ. worth of War Loan.part ii.-foreign affairs.FRANCE.At the request of the French Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government have expressed their general willingness to give certain facilities for the importation of Dutch foodstuffs into Northern France, within the limits of authorised relief rations, provided that the American Commission acts both as exporting agent and as intermediary between the Dutch Committee and the Laud-bau Export Bureau.BELGIUM.As the result of the refusal of the German Government to grant safe conducts to Belgian relief ships (of which two have actually been sunk), a number of vessels have been held up in British and American ports, whose cargoes of foodstuffs are urgently needed in Belgium. His Majesty&apos;s Government have intimated that the British naval&apos; authorities, will give favourable consideration to any proposal which the Germans may make in regard to the route which these relief ships should * follow ; it being noted that no safe course appears to exist on the northabout route, upon which the German Government has hitherto insisted.His Majesty the King of Spain (whose representatives in London and Brussels are patrons of the Belgian Relief Commission) has been requested, to make strong representations to the Emperor of Germany on this subject, and has done so.SWITZERLAND.On the 9th instant His Majesty&apos;s representatives abroad were instructed that the Swiss Government had agreed to take charge of German interests in the United Kingdom and British dependencies.INTERNAL CONDITIONS OF GERMANY.His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Basle reports that the middle classes are withdrawing their deposits from Banks in Berlin, well-informed circles discounting hopes of final. German victory.From Stockholm comes information that the German Chancellor recently informed, the leaders of the National Liberal and Centre parties that an indefinite prolongation of the present economic conditions in Germany&apos;could not be borne. It was hoped by means of the submarine &quot; blockade &quot; to compel England to make peace before the autumn.A confidential report from a reliable soixrce states that von Tirpitz and Reventlow hold the field in Berlin at present, and that everyone in authority seems completely obsessed, by the idea of bringing the war to an end by means of submarine frightfulness. Meanwhile, the population, of Berlin is suffering severely from want of food, even amongst the aristocratic and wealthy classes.&apos;    &apos; B
GREECE.His Majesty&apos;s Government learned on the 7th February that the French Government considered that the blockade should not be definitely raised, inasmuch as the terms of the Allied Notes of 31st December and 8th January had not been completely fulfilled. At the same time Lord Bertie described the measures which the French, in concert with His Majesty-&apos;s Government, were prepared ro take in order that adequate supplies of flour and wheat may be immediately available upon the raising of the blockade. On the 12th, however, the French Government intimated that they&apos;&apos; were not able to deplete their stocks in order to provision Greece. Sir F.&apos;Elliot was notified accordingly, and at the same time informed that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-raent cannot assume responsibility for victualling the country beyond making arrange-ments for a sufficient number of supply ships. The Italian Government have expressed their readiness to advance 5.000 tons in the case of urgent necessity arising and if guaranteed against loss. In this connection Sir F. Elliot, telegraphing on the 10th, expresses the opinion that to provision Royalist and Venizelist Greece separately will cause difficulty and delay. He suggests that all vessels required for this service should remain under time-charter and be sub-chartered by the British authorities at a rate (which might be fixed by the Greek Committee) to cover war insurance, &amp;c. His Majesty&apos;s Government hopes that wheat supplies for both parts of the country may be stored, in. common in one of the islands occupied by the Venizelists.The conditions named in the Allied Note of 3.1st December included, the dissolution of: the Reservists&apos; leagues. In a Greek Government Note handed to the Entente Legations on 3.1st January, it was stated that the necessary steps had been taken to dissolve these Leagues ; but judging by the riotous proceedings of a body of Reservists at the. Town Council, of Piraeus on the 3rd. instant, it appears to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-nient that these measures have not yet been made effective. Sir F. Elliot reported, on the 11th instant that the Leagues continue to exist under other names ; he therefore advises that the blockade should be maintained until the Allied Control Commission is satisfied that an adequate number of Government rifles have been surrendered and passed into the Morea.The Commission, to enquire into the events of 1st and 2nd December, and to determine the compensation for the victims, has not yet come together, the French Government^ representative not having been selected.As regards the proposed amnesty for political prisoners, Sir F. Elliot and Lord Granville have been informed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are in favour of insisting on a general amnesty in regard to the persons and property of Venizelists, simul-  * taneously with the release of Royalist hostages by the Provisional Government.Monsieur Jonnart, appointed to succeed M. Guillemin as Special Ambassador to Greece, had an interview with Lord Bertie in Paris on the 8t.li instant. The latter is of opinion that M. Jonnart&apos;s independent position will enable him to speak authori-tatively to the King of Greece in the name of the French Government, and at the same time to cope with General Sarraibs intrusions into the rjoliticai field. M. Jonnart hopes that Sir F. Elliot will co-operate with him. to attain the common aim of England and France a strong Greece, friendly to the Entente.With regard to the instructions conveyed to Lord Granville concerning Venizelists in Egypt (vide last week&apos;s Summary), Sir R. Wingate states that Venizelist repre-sentatives have agreed to jurisdiction by the Commander-in-Chiefs nominees, but they strongly urge that the British Governments decision, to allow this jurisdiction to be a matter of individual option will gravely imperil the whole position, possibly involving the collapse of the Venizelist, movement in Egypt, inasmuch as they have no means of securing united, action, by their widespread adherents. They suggest that it would meet the case to allow Royalists an option to remain under their Consuls upon giving notice of their intention to the Military authorities within a specified time.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris has been requested, to press upon the French Government, as a matter of urgency, that instructions be sent to General Sarrail in the sense that all transit facilities on the English Quay at Salonika must be appropriated to the exclusive use of the British Army.NETHERLANDS.The Netherlands Government. have been requested to assume charge of British interests in Belgium.Sir W. Townley has been directed to suggest to the Netherlands Government that, if possible, a number of English speaking medical men should be included in the
necessarily increased staff of their Legation at Berlin, for the purpose of inspecting the German internment camps containing British prisoners of Avar.On the 11th instant, His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Amsterdam reported that a German tug had arrived at Ymuiden, evidently for the purpose of towing out the Destroyer V. 69. On tire 12th it was stated that the Destroyer had left after completing her crew with men brought by this tug. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir W. Townley on the 8th. that only essential repairs, necessary to make the vessel seaworthy within the shortest possible time, had been permitted, and this in exercise of strict neutrality and in accordance with Article 17 of Hague Convention 13. The &quot; Glasgow&apos;s &quot; case had not been regarded as a precedent.In the Dutch note of protest addressed to the German Government on the subject of the submarine campaign, the Netherlands Government have laid stress on the direct violation of its neutral rights involved in the fact that the Netherlands and its Colonies are now completely severed by the Mediterranean route.On. the 10th February the Netherlands Minister informed. Lord It. Cecil that there was no intention to prohibit Dutch vessels trading with Great Britain ; the temporary restriction was due to our refusal, to give clearance to Dutch, ships in England. So soon as his Government were assured that Dutch ships would not be detained, all restrictions would, be removed on their side. He was informed that for every Dutch ship that arrived in a British, port, one would be cleared. In reply, he expressed the hope that Dutch traffic might be handled freely and generously without too strict adherence to the principle thus laid down.SWEDEN.In concert with the Norwegian and Danish Governments, Sweden has decided not to follow the lead of the United States in breaking off relations with Germany. In communicating this decision to the American Minister at Stockholm, the Swedish Government observed that the method which the United States had chosen as a means of shortening the war &quot; was absolutely contrary to the principles which have hitherto guided the policy of the Royal Government.&quot; A formal protest has been addressed to Germany, balanced by two (which the Minister for Foreign Affairs described as platonic) addressed to Great Britain.Sir E. Howard has been directed to inform the Swedish Government that His &apos;Majesty&apos;s Government hold conclusive evidence that the Emskilda Bank of Stockholm., in violation of their specific undertaking, have been (and still are) balancing purchases of dollars from Germany by sales of dollars to London.NORWAY.His Majesty&apos;s Government, have informed the Norwegian Minister that they cannot accept the Norwegian proposal to compromise the dispute over the copper agreement by allowing the export of 10,000 tons of pyrites to Germany. With a view to settling the matter, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to resume coal shipments if Norway will agree to limit the export of pyrites to Germany to the 2,000 tons, for which licences have been granted, and make satisfactory settlement of the several minor questions outstanding. A desired modification of the fish agreement would also be consented to.DENMARK.The Danish Government appear to be hesitating as to whether they should look to Germany for coal rather than obtain, it by running steamers to England with produce. Sir R. Paget suggests (12th February) that, in case of need, pressure might be brought to bear by withdrawing from Danish Atlantic traders the concession of calling at Halifax.The German submarine proclamation has caused much anxiety amongst farmers, who anticipate a shortage of imported fodder stuffs. An increased export of cattle to Germany will probably take place. The Government is unable to. limit the export, fearing both Germany and the farmers.
sSPAIN.Sir A. Haydinge lias been directed to convey to His Majesty the King of Spain an-expression of Hi s&apos;Majesty&apos;s Governments appreciation of his offer to assume charge-of British&apos; interests in enemy countries. J3is Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to avail themspives of that offer as regards British interests in Germany, owing to an agreement made with the Netherlands Government in I91G, but will gratefully accept His Majesty&apos;s oiler in regard to Austro-Hungary in the event of a rupture of relations between that Empire and the United States.Sir A. Hardinge and the French Ambassador at Madrid, concur in the opinion that no good, purpose would be served by requesting the Spanish Government to expel the-German and Austrian representatives, inasmuch as there would be no prospect of such a step being followed by a rupture of diplomatic relations. The Spanish Note to-Germany is described by Sir A. Hardinge as &apos;&quot; as strong a protest as could be made-in courteous terms by a country resolved in no case to go to war.&quot;PORTUGAL.The Admiralty proposals for the transport of Portuguese troops from Lisbon to Brest have been communicated to the Portuguese Government (10th February), together with, an intimation that the delay and. inconvenience of which the Portuguese Government have complained (vide last weelts Summary) would not have occurred if the transports had been handled in accordance with the original Admiralty programme.CHINA.The recruiting of coolie labour battalions at Wei-hai-Wei is proceeding satisfactorily.Acting upon the representations of the United States Minister, the Chinese Cabinet decided to send a Note (9th February) to the German Minister calling upon the German Government to abandon their submarine warfare ; it was understood that, in the event of an unsatisfactory reply, diplomatic relations would be severed.. The Chinese Government notified the British and Japanese representatives accordingly. On the 12th instant, the Chinese Minister in Tokio asked the advice of the Japanese Government as to whether China should sever relations with Germany without awaiting the reply to this Note. The Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs replied in the affirmative, and instructions were telegraphed to the Japanese Charge d&apos;Affaires at Peking to convey this advice to the Chinese Government. It is expected that the advice will be followed. Steps are being taken by the Chinese authorities at Shanghai to prevent the escape or destruction, of enemy ships.JAPAN.Sir C. Greene reports (10th February) that the decision, of the Japanese Cabinet to advise China to sever relations with Germany was conditional upon an assurance being received from the British, French, and Russian Governments that they are prepared eventually to support the attitude of. the Japanese Government at Peking.The Japanese Government have offered to supply Russia with certain consign-ments of heavy artillery and equipment in time for the spring offensive. It is understood that simultaneously negotiations are proceeding between the two Govern-ments in respect of the price payable by Japan for the section of the Russian Railway in Manchuria recently referred to in connection with the Russo-Japanese Convention.ARGENTINA.The active representations of the United States Ambassador, supported by the advice of the Allied Ministers, produced no appreciable effect on the Argentine Governments Note to Germany, which amounted to a brief generalisation, of international principles.A very large portion of German funds in the United States lias been remitted to the Argentine through the Guaranty Trust Company.
BOLIVIA.Replying (8th February) to the German Note, the Bolivian Government have formally protested against the irregular blockade and announced their intention of following the example of the United States. Bolivian representatives in South America have been directed to endeavour to persuade other Republics to do the same; a mission for the purpose is being sent to Peru, Ecuador, Columbia and Venezuela.CHILE.Sir F. Strange forwards a report to.the effect that Germans in Chile have received orders to proceed, to Mexico in the event of war with the United States.The Chilean Governments reply to the German Note, and treatment of German ships in Chilean ports, are alike based on principles of strictly prudent neutrality.BRAZIL.The Brazilian Government have addressed a strongly worded, protest to Germany, intimating that they will hold that country responsible for any loss of Brazilian, life or property. At the same time, the Minister for Foreign. Affairs wishes it to&apos; be understood that Brazi!&apos;s policy is quite independent of any initiative on the part of the United States. As regards German vessels in Brazilian ports, he has informed Mr. Peel that he believes most of the essential parts of their machinery have been destroyed. Concerning their possible seizure by the British Government, he points out that the State of San Paulo would oppose such action because the amount due by Germany to that State for coffee requisitioned is much greater than the value of all German ships in Brazil.URUGUAY.Mr. Mitchell lanes reports (10th February) that the Uruguayan Government will not take the risk of any strong line of action in regard to German ships at Montevideo ; it might do so if assured that the United States Government would, come toUruguay&apos;s assistance in case of need. The German position in Southern Brazil is regarded as a serious menace.MEXICO.The new Constitution will come into force on 1st May when the President and Congress assume office.Mr. Thurstan reports (13th February) the arrival of a party of Germans (said to be officers) on the West Coast last month, now probably stranded at Manzanillo. Also that a large shipment of munitions for the Mexican Government from Japan reached Manzanillo on the 11th instant. Mr. Thurstan sees no reason to suspect any connection between these facts.On the 14th February the Mexican Press published the text of a Note addressed by President Carranza to the principal neutral nations in which he invites them to join with him in putting an end to the war. He proposes to do this by stopping all supplies (beginning probably with oil) to belligerents.COLUMBIA.On the 12th February Sir C. Mallet (Panama) transmitted a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s representative at Bogota stating that on the 10th, the Columbian coastguards had reported a submarine in Magdalina Bay. A. British commercial agent has denied the truth of this report ; meanwhile, all shipping has been, brought to a standstill. A brisk business in petrol lias lately been done by Germans in Vessels trading from Panama.   They have large stocks accumulated at Buenaventura.SAN SALVADORMr. Young, His Majesty&apos;s representative in Guatemala, reports (7th February) that a Mexican gun-boat has brought a complete Telefunken wireless installation as a i C
gift to the Government of San Salvador, with mechanics to erect it. Mr. Young reportsa nervous feeling in , regard to Central American politics. The President of Guatemala.susjriects the Intentions of Mexico&apos; and San Salvador; v ... : :/ &apos;.Irff, [&apos;,:1^1.17&apos;[&apos;A:&apos;.,        &apos;..-: &apos;u^ri-ED states; &apos;     .L;!;j- \&apos;]. &quot;V,;:   ;\.Having reference to the seditious Ghadr activity in Manila, and to the fact that free communication between the United States and Manila is a vital part of the German plan for inspiring crime in India, His Majesty&apos;s Government have instructed Sir 0. Spring Rice to inform the American Government that there is conclusive evidence-to;: show that communications&apos; between German Agents are conveyed by American transports, in the form. :6f mails and goods.;- - &apos; -L; &apos;     &apos; : ----- .--- ;The Ambassador considers that the&apos;.financial and commercial situation will not allow hfhe&apos;Government -to - submit for-long to the present blockade of United States ports. As explaining the. attitude of the President, on the other hand, a recent despatch from Sir C. Spring-Rice to Mr. Balfour mentions the fact that the &quot; Christian Science Monitor,&quot; supposed to be in,, close touch with Mr. Wilson, believes in the possibility of a Court of International Sanction, and considers that the line of action laid down in Mr. BalfouFs Note&apos;-holds out distinct hopes/of its establishment. .A. very definite report forwarded.by the&apos;Ambassador ascribes the wireless message .sent by the Cologne Gazette Correspondent on the 6th February to the joint author-ship of the German Ambassador and Mr. Bryan.   This message, after stating that, the country does not endorse Mr. Wiison&apos;s action, in severing relations, suggests the calling of&quot;a, Conference of Powers. .. On the 8th February, in deference to the expressed wishes of the United States -Government,&apos;Sir C. Spring Rice was.authorised to state that the S.S. Frederick VIII., conveying the German Ambassador and party, would be allowed to dispense with the call at Kirk wall, arrangements being made to search her at Halifax instead. The vessePs sailing was fixed for the 14-th instant, the safe conduct thus granted being accompanied by a stipulation that no mails or passengers other than Germans were to be carried. As the result&apos; of a misunderstanding, however, the United States Ambassador in - London, -had informed the ship\s agents that there would be no objection to her carrying passengers, and all cabins were accordingly booked in New York&apos;. Under the: circumstances,: and. because of the! great importance which the United States Government attach to getting the German Ambassador out of the country, His Majesty-s Government (12th February) decided to allow the additional passengers to be carried on the understanding that this arrangement will necessarily involve some extra delay for purposes of examination and search at Halifax. All cargo is to be covered by navicerts.On.the 13th instant Sir R. Crawford . discussed. informally with the Secretary of the. Treasury and. the Governor of the Federal Reserve Board certain financial aspects of the present emergency. He suggested that the time had come for the United States Government to support the profitable movement,of American trade by affording or encouraging credit facilities to the Allies and especially Great Britain. His arguments were sympathetically received and immediate consideration promised ; full details will.be.telegraphed if the.scheme takes practical shape. Meanwhile, the State department has promised that- steps will, be taken, in the event of the United States becoming involved in the war, to prevent any action by the War and Navy Departments which might endanger the Allies&apos; supplies., GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.  ...According to information communicated-,from New York by Sir C. Spring Rice on 9th February, it would appear that the laying up of neutral shipping both in America and Europe has been to some extent influenced by German offers of compensation to shipowners for losses caused by postponement of sailings. These and other German measures made it necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to modify the North&apos; Sea freight regulations, with a view to inducing neutral ships to resume trading, and at the same time to ensure that the number of vessels in British or Allied ports be not reduced. This was done, and detailed &quot;instructions communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in Scandinavia on the 9th instant. On the following clay, -&apos;- His-Majesty&apos;s representatives abroad were notified that an Order in Council was about
GENERAL.The French Government have been informed that parcels for British Prisoners of War in Germany must in future pass through Switzerland, and not through Holland. The Netherlands Government have been requested to enquire of the German Government whether this report is correct.The Danish Government suggests the advisability of obtaining free passage into Denmark of foodstuffs from the United States destined for distribution to German Prisoners of War in Russia through the Danish Red Cross. It is suggested that, failing such an arrangement, the Red Cross might be prevented from sending supplies to British Prisoners of War in Gerraamr.to be issued providing that any vessel with goods for enemy destination or of enemy origin shall, be liable to capture and condemnation in respect of such goods. At the same time His Majesty:&apos;s Government decided to make arrangements to sanction an alternative British port of call, outside the danger zone, in lieu of a port in the United Kingdom, so as to meet the wishes of the Governments and shipowners concerned in traffic between Scandinavia and Holland and America. Certain of these arrangements, and. the conditions imposed as to navicerts, constitute a development of existing belligerent rights for which the only strict justification must lie on the ground of retaliation, for the German submarine blockade. Diplomatic representations concerning neutral shipping rights, and the detention of neutral vessels in British ports, have been, addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Government; but the decision to allow certain Atlantic traders to call at Halifax instead of Kirkwall, and the arrangements made for a protected trade route between . Norway and Great Britain, have had a generally reassuring effect. On the loth February an identical Note was addressed to Germany by the three Scandinavian Kingdoms, protesting against the illegality of the submarine blockade. The conditions of Anglo-Swedish traffic still leave much to be desired. The Swedish. Government has been informed that unless they improve, it may not be possible for Bis Majesty&apos;s Government to facilitate Swedish-American trade.With reference to the proposals advanced on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the purchase or requisition of Scandinavian shipping, Sir R. Paget (Copenhagen) and Sir M. Find!ay (Christiania) report that the Danish and Norwegian Governments fear that the sale of ships would be regarded by Germany as a breach of neutrality. They anticipate less risk should the vessels be requisitioned, though in that case formal protests &quot;would be made. His Majesty&apos;s Government have notified their readiness to requisition. Norwegian, ships upon receipt of a confidential intimation from the Norwegian Government that they will not seriously object. Sir M. Findlay reported on the 12th February that, to provide more tonnage for Transatlantic trade, the Norwegian Government propose to take powers to requisition Norwegian vessels, but the Prime Minister has assured him. that, if the law is passed, it is not intended to take ships from British or Allied trades.
