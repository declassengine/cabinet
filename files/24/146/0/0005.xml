SECRET.APPRECIATION- OF  the  ATTACHED   \Y  STERN  AND  GENERAL&apos;REPORT No, 5. &apos;LvrPERtAL CONFERENCE.The non-inclusion in the new National Government in Australia of Sir \V*. II. Irvine, Attorney-General in the last Liberal administration, may possibly be explained by Mr. Hughes&apos;s desire to bring him over to the Conference without further denuding his Cabinet. Sir W. II. Irvine is generally regarded as one of the ablest and strongest of Australian public men.France.M. Clementehs protest against our restriction of French imports is very strongly worded. But there is good reason for believing that the French Government fully realise the urgency of: the tonnage question, and that the difficulty can be amicably settled by direct discussion between M. Clementel and the President of the Board, of Trade, wi dun a impairing the general effectiveness of our measures for the restriction of imports.Greece.The French demand for the occupation, of Volo and Larissa is opposed by the naval, and military advisers of the British Government on. technical grounds. But even conceding the desirability of acquiring an additional base and line of communi-cations for the left wing of the Salonika Force it would seem inadvisable to accompany the very exacting enforcement of the terms of the recent ultimatum b3r an act of aggression which would create a violent outcry in Greece against our ill faith, and once more give the lead to the extreme an.ti-Ente.nti.st element. There is nothing to prevent the question, being raised again later, when the blockade is over, and relations may be on a friendlier footing, possibly with a new Greek Government and a different, set of Allied representatives at Athens.Meanwhile the Italian occupation of the section of the Santi Quaranta-Monastir road which passes through Greek territory, and of Konitza which lies some distance east of the road, and is not really essential, to the security of the road, has apparently created no great excitement in. Greece. This is no doubt due to the friendlier attitude of Italy to the Greek Government in. the recent crisis, and would confirm the conclusion indicated above with regard to Volo and Larissa.China. &apos;The slow development of the question of China&apos;s proposed severance of relations with Germany, and the activity displayed in the matter by the Japanese representative, justify the assumption that the Chinese Government will take no final steps unless assured in advance of compensating advantages of an. economic and financial character. In this connection two facts deserve to be borne in mind : (.1) that the section of
&quot; Young C1ii.ua,&quot; which has taken the initiative in the matter, is identified with Sun Yat Sen and others who have recently made large claims on the Chinese Government for funds wherewith to repay advances made by the Japanese at the time of the &quot;revolution &quot; against Y uan-Shih-K&apos;ai, and (2) that any arrangements that may be agreed to between the Intellectuals of tin; Knc-min-Tang party and Japan would certainly be. denounced by. one or more of the independent military factions. Knowledge of this fact vill no doubt prevent the Chinese Government taking any-decisive steps until assured that the financial resells are likely to be satisfactory to all concerned. Meanwhile, according to Press reports, Germany is carrying on a counter-campaign of public financial concessions and private bribes.I... S. A.1st March 1917.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.The Governor-General of the Australian Commonwealth reports by telegram of 22nd February that the delegates to the Conference will be Mr. W. M. ITughes (Prime Minister), Sir John Forrest (Treasurer), and Sir William Irvine (who was Attorney-General in the Liberal Administration of Mr. Cook, 1913-14).CANADA.An important statement by the Prime Minister as to Canadian enlistments was made before the adjournment of Parliament and appears in the Parliamentary Debates of 22nd January. Sir R. Borden stated that the enlistments in the Canadian Expeditionary Forces to that date numbered 392,G47. Besides that, the active Militia had been called out, and numbered 9,052. This, with the permanent force of 2,470, made a total of 404,169. In addition, 3,310 men had been enlisted in the Canadian Naval Service and 1,600 in the British NavaV Service, while 1,200 men had been provided for the Imperial Mechanical Transport and 3,000 for munition works in Great Britain.   It will thus be seen that the grand total reaches 413,279 men.With regard to the proposed Polish contingent, the Governor-General has informed the Secretary of State that the American Count Horoclyski intends, with the assistance of the Polish Falcon Alliance, to raise a Polish Legion for the Canadian Expeditionary Force. This has been approved by the Militia Department and some young Poles are already in. training. The Governor-General suggests that the Secretary of State should consult with Connt Horodyski and adds that the Falcon Alliance is a revolutionary body who dislike Germans, Austrians and Russians about equally and only want to enter the war on the winning side with the view of helping forward the independence of Poland.AUSTRALIAN COMMON WEALTH.The Secretary of State has suggested that the Australian Government should cease exporting horses to Java while Holland continues to export them to Germany.The Government have intimated that they cannot agree to the suggestion that the provisions of the Australian Army Act should be extended so that the Commonwealth forces serving outside Australia should be subject to the death penalty for desertion or cowardice in the same way as the Imperial or Canadian forces.With regard to the sale of 3,000,000 tons of wheat to the Imperial Government, the Commonwealth state that, while not interfering&apos; with this minimum, they will sell wheat and flour to South Africa and other Dominions, and, subject to approval, to neutrals. After allowing for British, local and South African necessities the Govern-ment expect to have a large surplus. All accommodation in steamers is being kept for the wheat sold to the Imperial authorities.In reply to the proposed restrictions of imports, the Governor-General reports that the Commonwealth will incur great loss with regard to apples, as all arrangements for the transport, &amp;o, of the season&apos;s crop had- been made. If the decision cannot be varied the Commonwealth will acquiesce, but the Governor-General points out that it would be a great help to Australia if no restriction werp placed, upon dried, preserved and pulped fruits and jams.NEW ZEALAND. The Government has agreed to the proposed restrictions of imports.SOUTH AFRICA.The Secretary of State has informed the Governor-General confidentially that licences will be granted by the Imperial authorities for the importation of fruit on the
part ii.-foreign affairs.FRANCE.The French Ambassador, under instructions, has addressed a communication to the Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs (27th February) on the subject of the prohibition of imports into Great Britain, expressing- the French Governments grave apprehensions as to the effect upon French trade and industries of the contemplated restrictions. M. Paul Cambon observes that it would have been well had the British Governments intentions been communicated to the French Government before being carried into effect, and suggests that it is extremely advisable, even now, that the President of the Board of Trade should accept the invitation tendered by the Ministry of Commerce and proceed to elucidate matters in Paris. In view of the vital importance to France of her trade in silk, wines, and spirits, M. Briand trusts that liberality may continue to be shown in the matter of licences ; at the same time he asks to be exactly informed as to tire British Governments intentions and proposed methods of procedure.An official memorandum by M. Clementel, Minister of Commerce, forwarded with the above despatch, shows in detail the probable effect of the proposed restrictions on the surviving industries of France and observes that, unless the matter be reconsidered (adhering to the principle of reciprocity hitherto existing) the results -cannot fail to be seriously prejudicial to good relations.South African Government certifying that space is available in Union Castle ships -carrying cold storage supplies.The Army Council have instructed 20 leading natives to be returned to South Africa from the Labour Contingent in order to inform their people -as to the conditions -of employment in Fj-ance.RHODESIA.The Army Council have advised that the contingent of 500 natives which is being raised should be offered to General Northey. It is indicated that, an additional 500 would be welcome for the purpose of relieving units of the King&apos;s African Rifles now -operating in German East Africa.GOLD COAST.In explaining to the Governor the restriction upon the importation of British cocoa to 50 per cent, of the 1916 imports, the Secretary of State has pointed put that there is already a twelve months&apos; stock in this country.WEST INDIES.The Secretary&apos;of State has informed the Governor of Jamaica that with regard to the exclusion of rum, there is already a four years&apos; stock in this country. He has, however, suggested to the West Indian Governors that their. distilleries might be utilised for the production of alcohol in place of rum, and. replies have been received that this cannot be done as regards rectified alcohol, though considerable quantities of spirit could be produced, varying from 10 to 05 degrees overproof, which could be rectified in the United Kingdom.CEYLON.With regard to the reduction of tea importation to 120,000. tpns (or 24,000 tons less than in 1910) from India and Ceylon, the Governor suggests that the restriction in relation to Ceylon should be based on an average of years and. not on an exceptional, year such as 1916. In the year chosen, India increased her production, and, owing to climatic causes, the Ceylon production was below normal. In reply the Secretary of State has expressed the fear that, owing to the serious tonnage situation, it will be impossible in any event to allow a larger importation from Ceylon than that fixed.
i;, BELGIUM.&apos;The German Government have recentljr endeavoured to obtain information-regarding the position of relief ships in British ports and elsewhere from the Relief Commission^ Rotterdam office, their recpiest for a statement on the subject being addressed to the Spanish Government. It has been impressed on the Relief Commission that no such information is to be supplied to anyone.According to a wireless message to the &quot; Chicago Tribune,&quot; the German Government &quot; is not going to permit the submarine campaign to interfere in any way with relief ships bound for Belgium.&quot; On the same day (22nd February) as this message was sent,. Sir W. Townley was directed to draw attention to the fact that no reply had been received from Germany to the British Governments enquiries made on 1st February,, regarding valid safe-conducts to Rotterdam for the relief ships now in British ports. There were 14 of these vessels, carrying more than. 60,000 tons of foodstuffs for Belgium, detained by reason of Germany&apos;s indiscriminate frightfulness. Under the circumstances, Sir W. Towniey was instructed to request the Netherlands Government to take note of the gross inhumanity displayed by Germany in this matter, and to inform the German Government that unless safe-conducts for these ships were issued within a week, they would be unloaded and their cargoes used for British consumption.Arrangements are proceeding, in consultation with the Dutch authorities, for the re-organisation of the work of the Relief Commission, to take effect if and when the . American delegates retire from its direction and control. The latter are now reported to be willing to remaimfor the present (Sir C. Spring Rice, despatch of 26th February), but the United States Minister is not satisfied with his personal position, at Brussels-and desires to leave.GREECE.Judged by the light of their official acts and communications, the Greek Government would appear to be desirous of establishing improved relations with the Entente Powers and of checking, as far as possible, any overt manifestation of support for the enemy. Referring to the Allied Ministers&apos; communique of the 17th February, in a Note Verbale of the 21st, the Government state that there is no question of any arms or artillery being concealed that could be used by hostile organisations ; at the same time they deny that any such organisations exist. The feeling appears to be gaining ground that the Greeks have finally decided to do their best to carry out the conditions imposed upon them ; on the other hand there is evidently ground for the belief, prevalent in more than one quarter, that the lack of unity and coherence manifested in the Councils of the Allies constitutes an appreciable factor in the existing situation, and that no permanently satisfactory solution is likely to be reached unless the French Government adopts a more definite and reasoned policy for the guidance of its representatives in Greece. The conflict of opinion between the French military authorities and their colleagues of the-Allied Military Control in regard to the condition of Thessaly still continues (vide last week&apos;s Summary). Lord Granville reports (24th February) that General Sarrail finds further confirmation of his apprehensions in the fact that a patrol of French -Senegalese was recently caught and put to death by a body of Greek comitadjis, north of the neutral zone.The French Governments views on the subject were communicated to His-Majesty&apos;s Government in a memorandum forwarded, with a covering despatch, by Lord Bertie on the 25th February. They are of opinion that the blockade should not -be raised till the Greek Government have satisfactorily fulfilled all their engagements and finally put a stop to internal intrigues and agitation against the Allies. They hold, moreover, that the safety of General sarrail&apos;s army is as yet by no means guaranteed, and, in order to make it secure, they urge that His Majesty&apos;s Government should reconsider, and agree to, the pacific occupation of Volo and Larissa, to which measure the Russian and Italian Governments have already assented.The French Government consider that normal relations with Greece cannot be-restored until (1) an amnesty has been, granted to the Venizelists, simultaneously with the release of the Royalists held as hostages ; (2) the Commission of Enquiry has determined the procedure for the punishment of the guilty in the attack on the
Allies on 1st December; and (3) the Greek Government lias put a stop to the Press campaign against the Allies. Finally, the French Government are ol opinion that restoration of. normal relations with Greece would be facilitated by a simultaneous change of all the Allied representatives, a matter which has already been considered at Paris and Petrograd.Sir F. EUiot, replying to His Majesty&apos;s Government, has expressed the opinion that it is not expedient to raise the blockade and then let Germany bear the reponsi-bility for subsequent shortage of wheat supplies, unless the grain ships now on their way from America should be torpedoed. The first of these vessels is due to reach Athens on the 5th March, by which time he hopes that it may be found, possible to declare the blockade raised.As regards the provisioning of Loyalist and Venizelist Greece, Sir F. Elliot observes that the two Governments having accepted our proposals for dealing with this matter, it will now remain for the Allied Board to cany out the distribution of foodstuffs with strict impartiality from the joint supply. This the Board proposes to do, allotting 15,000 tons monthly to Venizelist territory and 19,000 tons to the rest of Greece. The French Minister apprehends friction between Athens and Salonika over this question, of distribution, and . Lord Granville (telegraphing on the 24th February) apparently shares this opinion. He reports that the Provisional Government attribute the impending shortage of wheat to the machinations of the National Bank, and urge that they should receive preferential treatment at the hands of the Allies, inasmuch as Old Greece is properly suffering for the faults of its rulers. His Majesty\s Government anticipate that during March and April the supplies of wheat available for both sides will be inadequate, and are doing their best to supple-Government them ; at the same time they have advised the Greek authorities that they should use every endeavour to induce the Italian and French Governments to assist them in tiding over the impending period of short supplies.The Greek Government have agreed to the proposal that the Mixed Commission on Indemnities should commence its sittings, and that its findings will be binding upon the Greek Government. They propose, however, as a matter of equity, that the Greek representatives should be numerically equal to those of. the Allied Powers, and that, in the event of disagreement, a neutral umpire should decide.A Naval Detachment sent, with an Intelligence Officer, to prepare the inhabitants of Cerigo for the return of the Royalist police and other authorities, found the people of the island unanimously opposed to the change and prepared to resist it by force. Some of the Royalists have also petitioned the Senior Naval Officer at Suda Bay, objecting to being sent back. Under these circumstances, and at the request of Sir. F. Elliot, the naval authorities have suspended action pending further instructions.On or about the 16th February detachments of Italian troops were advanced towards Lonitza, the Greek Government being officially notified by the Italian Minister of the necessity for this temporary movement for the better security of transport and supply. Sir F. Elliot reports I hat since then. Konitza has been occupied by the Italians because a Greek band had established itself there after the departure of the Greek troops.GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Sir II. Rum bold forwards information from a reliable source to the effect that the condition of affairs at Hamburg is &quot;absolutely deplorable&quot; and that the moral of troops in that district has deteriorated by 7.5 per cent. A similar report has been received in regard to the physical and moral deterioration of the German troops in Belgium ; it states, moreover, that the relations between the German civil and military authorities are growing steadily worse.The attention of His Majesty&apos;s representatives at Stockholm, Copenhagen and the Hague has been drawn to the fact that Germany derives, from Switzerland alone, a supply of lubricants, estimated at 1,500 tons per annum, removed from railway engines and carriages on their arrival in Germany from that country. The railway and other authorities concerned are to be approached, with a view to ascertaining whether the same method of obtaining lubricants is practised in Scandinavia and Holland and, if so, to checking it.Germany is apparently suffering from the cutting off of its usual supply of sympathetic-thetic opinions from the United States.   Wireless messages addressed to Senator2464- 5 %
Stone and Mr. Hearst by the &quot; Vossischo Zeitung &quot; on the 23rd, ask for a &quot; statement of the precise situation &quot; on the ground that &quot; since the rupture of relations. Renter&apos;s misrepresentations have been more than ever incontrollable.&quot; According to the Berlin correspondent of the &quot; Chicago Daily News,&quot; (26th February), the German Press is now almost entirely dependent on London and Paris for American news.SWITZERLAND.Sir H. Rum bold reports (21th February) that difficulties are being created, prejudicial to the cause of the Allies, in Switzerland, by the Italian detention (or requisitioning) of 10,000 tons of oil-cuke and 8,000 tons of oleaginous seeds, the property of the Swiss Government. He considers it extremely inadvisable that the-Federal authorities should be thus provided with a pretext, of the kind which the French have already had to resist, for requisitioning raw materials belonging to the Allies in Switzerland, and observes that as the whole responsibility for the purchase and transport of this imported oil-cake falls upon England and France, lite Italian Governments action in detaining these goods is unfair.. NETHERLANDS.: The Shipping Trust have supplied Sir W. Townley with a list of 14 Dutch steamers now on their way to Holland from North and South. America, and have requested that these vessels may be permitted to call at Halifax for examination, and thence proceed direct to Holland.Sir W. Townley reports that the destruction, of the seven Dutch ships has created consternation in Holland. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed him that the.fleet did not sail when, authorised to do so by the British authorities on the 17th instant, because they were awaiting permission and a safe passage guarantee from the Germans. They received an assurance that the necessary instructions, granting safe conduct, would, have been sent to the submarine commanders on and after the 22nd February whereupon they sailed but no assurance was given that these instructions would, reach all the submarines at large.The. German submarine (B 30) which recently ran aground near Flushing has been interned, together with her crew.SWEDEN.The question of the neutrality of the Aland Islands, and the declarations given in regard thereto by the Allied Governments, were discussed in a secret session of the Swedish Parliament on the .1.0th instant. Sir P.. Howard considers that the question, as between Sweden and Russia, is not likely to become acute again.The draft agreement resulting from the recent Anglo-Swedish negotiations in London was under consideration by a secret Committee of the Swedish Parliament on the 23rd and 24th instant. Sir 1.0. Howard has been informed by Mr. Marcus Wallenberg that Swedish acceptance of the agreement is likely to depend largely upon, the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to facilitating imports of cereals into Sweden. In this connection Sir E. Howard has received instructions to intimate io Mr. Wallenberg and to the Minister for Foreign. Affairs that Great Britain&apos;? refusal to give the specific assurances asked for under this heading by the Swedish delegates was due to the Swedish Governments having violated its under-taking not to export cereals. In this matter His Majesty&apos;s Government have just cause for grave complaint, and Sir E. Howard has been directed to hint, that, in case of need, all. the facts may be made public.As the result of conversations between the Swedish leaders and the Norwegian, Minister for Foreign Affairs, both Governments have decided to withdraw their troops stationed along the frontiers.NORWAY.Sir M. Find!aV considers that the position of the Government has been improved by the settlement of the difficulties arising out of the fish and copper agreement and by the proposal to submit the hitter question to further examination, by jurists.
DENMARK.The internal situation continues to be complicated and difficult. On the one hand, the refusal of Danish shipowners and crews to face the German submarine danger zone has led to a great accumulation of the agricultural produce which should by agreement have been exported to Great Britain ; on the other, considerable pressure is being brought to bear on the Government by the farmers, anxious to sell their produce (if needs be) to Germany. Finally, there is the loyal assurance given by the Danish Government, that under no circumstances will Germany be allowed to have any of Great Britain&apos;s stipulated share of produce. The German Government threatened a week ago that if the accumulated produce were shipped to Great Britain, the vessels carrying it would be torpedoed, in which case, the Minister of Foreign Affairs would have resigned ; but on the 25th February Sir R. Paget Avas able to report that the Germans had been led to recognise Denmark&apos;s right to export these food-stuffs. As a partial and temporary solution of the Anglo-Danish problem, arrangements have been made for Danish vessels to proceed as far as Bergen in territorial waters and there tranship cargo for England into Norwegian ships. But here, again, difficulties arise from the fact that Norwegian shipowners are unwilling to agree that any coal cargoes which they may bring back from England should be liable to transhipment to Denmark, as originally suggested by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In the meanwhile His Majesty&apos;s Governments general policy is to. withhold supplies of cattle-fodder and fertilisers, so that the Danish farmers may be led to bring pressure to bear on. shipowners to resume direct sailings to Great Britain. Sir R. Paget perceives in this course danger of a crisis being produced, which might lead to the resignation of the Government and to the supercession of the agreements made under the present administration with the assistance of His Majesty the King.SPAIN.As an example of the thoroughness with which Germany conducts her propaganda in neutral countries, and of the far-reaching political ends served by her submarine terrorism, Sir A. Hardinge reports the following in a recent despatch (No. 51) on the authority of an ex-Minister : A leading fruit grower has contracted to supply large quantities of oranges to Hamburg by next April. For this cargo the German purchasers have actually paid in cash, on the strength of assurances given by the German embassy that, before the end of March, England would be reduced to famine and Germany&apos;s peace terms accepted by the Allies.PORTUGAL.The Portuguese Government have requested financial assistance for the purpose of purchasing wheat, the country&apos;s visible supplies on the 22nd instant being sufficient for about a fortnight. They ask for a loan of the same amount and on the same terms as that of last year.The proposals of the Portuguese Government for modification of the Admiralty&apos;s programme for the embarkation and transport of Portuguese troops to France have been examined and found impracticable. Sir L. Carnegie was therefore instructed on the 23rd instant to inform the Portuguese Government that, under existing conditions, it will be best to adhere to the present arrangements.iCHINA.Mr. Alston reports (25th February) that the Chinese authorities, in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Shanghai, have adopted all possible precautions to prevent the German ships from being sunk, disabled or put to sea by their crews, in the event of relations being severed between China and Germany. Assistance will be rendered if and when necessary by members of the Imperial Maritime Customs staff and by the Japanese coast patrols.The Chinese Minister in London has submitted proposals for certain assurances, to be given to China in anticipation of her severing relations with Germany. Similar proposals&apos; have   been tentatively put forward  by the  Chinese Minister at Tokio2461-5 c
and by the Chinese Foreign Office to the French Minister at Peking. China asks Great Britain that she may be assured of (1) Protection hereafter against retaliatory action by Germany ; (2) Representation at any international Conference or Congress that may be held after the war, and (3) Postponement of the Boxer indemnity payments. The proposals made at Peking include a loan to the Chinese Government, in addition to revision of the Customs Tariff and. suspension of the rule which excludes Chinese troops from the Foreign Concessions. Pending a formal and direct communication of these demands by the Chinese Government to all the Allied Powers, Mr. Alston has been instructed to say that, so soon as China has severed relations with Germany and become involved in the war, Great Britain will be ready to discuss them, in a friendly spirit and, in concert with her Allies, to enter into the necessary negotiations. Meanwhile, at the suggestion of the Japanese Charge d&apos;Affaires, on the 24th instant, Mr. Alston took advantage of the Vice-Presidents visit to &quot;Peking to urge upon him, through. Mr. Liang Ch&apos;i-ch&apos;ao (Diplomatic Adviser to the Government), that China should definitely proclaim herself on the side of the Allies without further loss of time.BRAZIL.Mr. Peel, telegraphing on the 26th, states that a very bad impression has been caused in Brazil-by the British Governments prohibition of coffee imports. This is regarded in many quarters as a measure intended to compel Brazil to join the Allies against Germany. The London correspondent of the &quot; Jornal do Commercio &quot; has cabled that coffee Would probably be admitted if the German ships interned in Brazil were used to transport it. Mr. Peel, assuming this statement to be officially inspired, suggests that the British and French Governments should jointly either purchase the surplus coffee (on the understanding that all outstanding debts and claims must be met), or give the Brazilian Government, in return for the requisitioning of enemy ships, a guarantee for the value of the coffee requisitioned by the Germans at Antwerp and Hamburg.MEXICO.Mr. Thurstan, telegraphing on 25th February, reports that II German sailing vessels at Santa Rosalia (Gulf of Calefornia) were recently authorised by the Mexican authorities to take in provisions without Customs supervision. It is presumed that these preparations are connected with the movements of four Germans who came from San Francisco to Mazatlan. (south-east of Santa Rosalia) on the 20th. One, a naval officer, has gone to Colima. The British Vice-Consul at Guaymas telegraphs that a suspicious yacht sailed from Mauzanillo on the 22nd, and an American vessel has reported a German submarine near Panama. Germans in considerable numbers are arriving daily in Mexico city from the United States, and Mr. Thurstan fears their impending activities.COSTA RICA.Sir C. Spring Rice has been informed that the Unite i States Government will not recognise the new Government of Costa Rica, nor the j :esul.t of any elections held: under their direction. Washington demands a rettxn to the status quo ante. Sir G. Mallet, cabling from Panama on the 26th, considers that the State Departments attitude in. this matter is ill-advised, inasmuch as the deposition of President Gonzalez is approved by all political parties, and any attempt to re-instate him would be resisted. The new Government is strongly pro-Ally, whereas President Gonzalez was under German influence.UNITED STATES.;Telegraphing on the 26th instant, Sir C. Spring I ice stated that the severance of relations with Austria is now expected. On the 21st he had reported that negotia-tions might be protracted, as Turkey was unwilling - o let the missionaries go. In tliei same despatch he said that the Chicago Chamber-of Commerce and other bodies were petitioning the President to take steps to relieve the congestion of trade ; that
94.&apos;&apos;GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.At the risk of antagonising a certain section of commercial and political opinion in Scandinavia and Holland, His Majesty&apos;s Government are adhering to the policy, and to the negotiations therefrom ensuing, either for acquiring neutral ships by purchase or charter, or for inducing their present owners to continue trading to British and Allied ports; German intrigues are clearly reflected in the attitude and actions -of certain Scandinavian and Dutch shipowners and crews, who evidently accept the view impressed upon them from Berlin, that, if they lay up their ships for the present, their temporary losses will be outweighed by the great increase in the value of their tonnage after the war. Thej&apos; believe that the Entente&apos;s shipping will then have been so reduced that neutrals must secure great advantages. Nevertheless, there is effective pressure in the opposite direction in the measures adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, by withholding coal and other essential supplies, and by refusing to release ships now in British ports except as, and when, others of the same nationality arrive with approved cargoes.His Majesty&apos;s representative at the Hague has stated to all the parties concerned that, in view of the action of the Netherlands Government in recalling their ships to port (thus promoting the aims of Germany&apos;s submarine campaign), no conciliatory measures can be expected from His Majesty&apos;s .Government until regular shipping service between Holland and Great Britain, is resumed from that side. At the same time, it has been, suggested that the Butch Government might see fit to agree to the transfer of Dutch ships to the British flag for the period of the war.In Sweden, the pro-German Press has directed a violent campaign against the British regulations affecting neutral shipping, and especially against the refusal to allow Swedish, vessels to leave British ports until replaced by new arrivals. The general attitude of the Swedish Government, and their persistent attempts to thwart the policy of the Allies in dealing with Germany&apos;s submarine warfare, have formed the subject of strong representations by Sir E. Howard. Possibly, as the result, and also because shipowners are beginning to realise that the submarine campaign is not likely to secure a German peace, a body of opinion more favourable to the Allies is finding expression in the Swedish Parliament. Sir E. Howard reports (26th February) that the exponents of this opinion are disposed to open the Kogrund passage, and thus release the British ships now detained in the Baltic. A. debate in Parliament on the 23:rd showed that the majority were in favour of a resumption of shipping; the Government were charged with unneutral tendencies.In Norway, the Government and shipowners have proposed meeting the shortage of coal by importing from the United States, but the British Governments intimation that all vessels engaged in such traffic would be required to call at Kirkwall should prove, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Minister, a sufficient deterrent. On the 26th (by which date about 20 vessels had. cleared for England), Sir M. Fincllay reported that he hoped soon to be in a position to submit proposals for the regular provision of Norwegian shipping for the coal carrying trade.Recognising the peculiar difficulties of the Danish Government, caused chiefly by Germany&apos;s exploiting of the self-interest of the farmer class, His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed provisionally to the arrangement by which Danish agricultural produce is to be sent to Bergen for transhipment to England ; also to the release of fodder boats for Denmark. Fertilisers and foodstuffs continue, however, to be detained in British ports and at Halifax, a form of pressure which it is intended to apply till direct sailings are resumed. In order to facilitate these sailings, His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed to insure two cargoes from Denmark against war risk at -8 per cent., either for a direct voyage or from Bergen transhipped.the Committee on Preparedness was sitting continuonsly and naval preparations rapidly proceeding, and that the general impression appeared to be that if the United States were eventually forced to take part in hostilities, assistance would be given primarily to France, so as to avoid the unpopularity of making common cause with England and Russia.
