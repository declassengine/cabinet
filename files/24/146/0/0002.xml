secret:APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERAL]REPORT, No.  2.Imperial Conference.General Botha and his Ministers appear to have been surprised and rather hurt at discovering that questions of the future trade relations and future constitution of the Empire are likely to be raised at the Conference in General Botha&apos;s absence. It is obvious that there is still some confusion in their minds as between the meetings of the War Cabinet to which the Dominions were invited in order to discuss the conduct of the war and of British diplomacy, and the discussions at the Special War Conference at the Colonial Office, where any..subject of mutual interest may be raised by any of the members. If Canada, for instance, wishes to discuss the future constitution of the Empire the Colonial Office obviously cannot veto the discussion on the grounds that General Smuts has not been instructed to discuss it, though it is always open to General. Smuts to explain that South Africa is not yet prepared for sach a discussion and cannot consider itself bound by any resolution which may be arrived at.East Afiuca.The Belgian military occupation of the western portion of German East Africa creates a somewhat awkward situation. The Belgians will naturally put forward a claim for the retention of this territory. Such a claim is obviously inadmissible, whether regarded from the point of view of British interests, and more particularly of the Cape to Cairo railway connection, or of the natural geographical and adminis-trative sub-division of Africa, or of the interests of Belgium, which after this war will want, not more tropical territory to develop, but more capital with which, to develop adequately and administer efficiently her already immense trorjical Empire and to restore her own domestic industries. The urgency of the last-named problem and the anxiety of Belgium with regard to the future position of Belgian industry, especially in the event of a change of tariffs in the United Kingdom,- have recently been impressed upon Mr. Balfour by the Belgian Minister in London.Greece.The most serious factor in the situation now seems to be the danger of famine resulting as a consequence of the Allied blockade. Even if nothing untoward happens it appears doubtful if food can come in time to prevent a period of very serious deprivation, which might possibly culminate in real disaster if the new submarine campaign inflicts much damage to our shipping in the Mediterranean.The German Submarine Campaign.The underlying idea of the whole German submarine campaign is clearly the conviction that the quantity of shipping available in the world is already so reduced that any appreciable further reduction will speedily create an intolerable situation for somebody.   If England can manage to feed herself she will only do so, it is
lioped, at the cost of cutting down supplies of coal and other essential raw materials and munitions to her Allies, and so weaken their offensive power and compel them to envisage the possibility of coming to terms. Or else it will be at the cost of neutrals who, already prevented by our rationing policy -from accumulating large reserves, will be faced with starvation and make desperate efforts to bring collective pressure to bear in favour of peace.The fi st effect upon the United States has been unfavourable for Germany. She runs the risk of war with America and of the releasing for Allied purposes of the whole of the German shipping now in American ports. But war has not yet been declared. The East has blazed up quickly, but from the Middle West, coupled with firm assurances of support from all, including even G-erman Americans, comes the insistent demand to preserve peace if possible. President Wilson, with his customary secretiveness, has not shown his hand, and there is still plenty of opportunity for Germany to suggest concessions and to get them conveyed from Count Bernstorff to the President by unofficial channels. And if it comes to the worst Germany, no doubt, hopes that President Wilson will join the Allies with the firm intention of pressing them, collectively and severally, to make peace at&apos; the earliest possible opportunity.The effect on. the other neutrals is still uncertain. Thej^ are evidently terrified by the situation, and one of the first results hoped for by the Germans, the laying up of neutral tonnage, has to some extent been produced, though there is reasonable hope of bringing some of this tonnage out again by the terms Ave propose to offer. Though formal protests are being made to Germany, there is no disposition among any of the^neutrals to join with President Wilson in breaking off relations. The temptation to Spain to enter the field as the eventual arbiter at the-Peace Con-ference is obvious, and the King of Spain&apos;s offer to take over the representation of British interests in Germany may be connected with this. The King of Sweden is apparently working &quot;hard for Scandinavian solidarity, but it is by no means certain that such a solidarity would not have a pro-German bias.Holland is in the most difficult position of all the neutrals, and though Germany/ in deference to her representations^has shifted the boundary of her zone of blockade in order to leave an open waterway from Holland northwards, it is not yet clear how far that concession will meet the case. Intimately connected with the Dutch question is that of 5the victualling of Belgium and the occupied regions of Northern France, and Germany no doubt hopes to bring pressure to bear on the French and Belgian Governments by threatening to leave the occupied regions to starve.L.

PART I. - BRITISH EMPIRE AND-AFRICA,IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.It is unlikely that the Conference will meet before the first week in March at the&apos; very earliest. The Governor-General of,the Commonwealth of Australia reports that the Prime Minister will probably be able to attend the Conference.Telegraphing on 5th February, the Governor-General for the Union of South Africa submits General Botha&apos;s opinion that discussion of the future Constitution of the Empire would be inopportune at the special War Conference. To the Government of the Union it had seemed clear that neither the ultimate commercial nor the&apos; constitutional question would be included in the formal programme of&apos; the Conference. \COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,At the instance of the Ministry of Munitions, the Government of the Commonwealth has been requested to endeavour to supplement the assistance already rendered in supplying skilled labour for shipyard and engineering work in Great Britain.The total number of troops undergoing training at the end of the year, including officers, was 18,588. December reinforcements, together with new Units, amounted to 8,156. With reference to the possibility of raising-further troops, the Secretary of State, telegraphing on 1st February, emphasised the urgent need for men, and requested that Ministers should earnestly consider the possibility of forming a Sixth Australian Division at once, or at least three additional, infantry Brigades, to reach England during July at latest. On the same day the G-governor-General had telegraphed suggesting that the recruiting campaign in Australia would be greatly assisted if telegrams for publication could be sent by the Pr me Minister,,. Field Marshal Haig, and others.The Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, in a despatch to the Colonial Office (5th February) recapitulates the terms&apos;&apos; and conditions arranged in recent contracts for purchase of wheat by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and discusses question of tonnage and freight space requirements. In this connection the Governor-General observes that the&apos;existence of two separate systems of control, the British Governments and the Australian, renders successful administration impossible.NEW ZEALAND.Considerable apprehension is felt and has been expressed by the New Zealand Government concerning the extension of German submarine warfare and the possibility of its endangering freight ships and transports during the period of voyage . wherein no protective escort is provided.In view of the possibility of further trouble by the waterside&apos; workers (who are now limiting output), the Government is contemplating the organisation of dockers&apos; battalions and wharf control on lines similar to those adopted in Great Britain.SOUTH AFRICA.For the purposes of the Army Council, the Government of the Union has been requested to raise certain.units of Cape coloured labourdn connection with horse and. mechanical transport in France.EAST AFRICA.The Governor-General of Portuguese East Africa is being approached with a view ,to obtaining his consent to the recruiting of native carriers for service with the British forces.Arrangements are being made that, after its transfer by the Belgians to the British authorities, Tabora shall remain in the first instance under military administration, The British occupation of Tabora will be complete, but the railway (vide SirF. Villiers&apos; Havre despatch of 8th September 1916) and other districts at present occupied are intended to remain under Belgian administration.
-   . . . - NIGERIA.&apos; Arrangements have been Bade.&quot;for-despatch this month of . 500 recruits and 1,000 carriers foe service in East Africa.,   LIBERIA. :Ofr the 67 Kroo chiefs tried and sentenced on charges of rebellion, ,,40 were reprieved, and the rest condemned to execution -on the 2nd February. &apos;   .MAURITIUS..; Arrangements have been made, and accepted by the Army Council, for,the enrol-m-ent of a labour battalion for service in Mesopotamia.-part II.-foreign affairs.ITALY,From Information received from private sources in Paris it would appear that M. Cailiaux&apos;s purpose, in endeavouring to organise a pro-peace coalition against the present Government, was originally inspired from Austria. In French radical circles it is believed that M. Oaillanx hoped,&apos;after creating a successful peace movement, to return to power in France with the support of the Socialists and Roman Catholics. The actual result of his intrigues is&apos;.that he has been finally disavowed by the Radical Socialist party.   At the same time he still wields considerable influence in the:provinces, because of and through his nominees and proteges in prefectural and.&quot;other offices.At a Conference held on the 26th January between the Prime Minister and representatives of the Italian Government, to discuss Italian requirements of tonnage, the Prime Minister said that he understood Italy required 800,000 tons per month. Of this she could herself provide 500,000 tons. The British Government would do its utmost to make up the balance of 300,000 tons. He was confident that for the &quot;month of February this balance might be provided by requesting the Admiralty to find 125,000 tons, and by withdrawing 100,000 tons from French service; the remainder (75,000 tons) would have to be taken from neutral tonnage. There was no possibility of supplying any additional quantity in January, the Admiralty&apos;s Strategical Reserves having already been drawn upon to supply &quot;Italy.&quot;The Italian Ambassador expressed gratitude for the way in which his Governments request had been met.Sir R. Rodd has been instructed (Foreign Office telegram, No. 274 of 5th February) th,ask the.Italian Government for an explanation of another case of trading with the enemy, in which ten wagons of Italian-origin borax have passed from Switzerland into Germany at the request of the Italian Minister at Berne ; the reported object of: the transaction being to obtain aniline dyes. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador is directed to protest against the Italian Governments making exchanges, without consulting their allies, of a nature which stultify the allied blockade arrangements.GREECE.Lord Bertie reports (5th February) the appointment of M. Jo^nart, ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs, to replace M. Guillemin as special Ambassador to Greece.The effects of the blockade are being seriously felt, not only by Royalist Greece but also at Salonika ; according to Lord Granville (3rd February) there will be famine there at the beginning of March unless a supply of wheat can be brought in &quot;before the end of February, and he suggests obtaining 20,000 tons from India. Sir F. Elliot, telegraphing on 1st February, observes that as supplies in hand are calculated to last -till the end of February for Venizelist Greece alone, arrangements must also be made for providing for immediate requirements of Royalist Greece. As emergency -measures, His Majesty-s Government has given permission for the release of certain grain-laden Greek vessels detained in Allied ports, and others in America.   For
the future it is proposed (Foreign Office telegram No. 190) that the rationing for the whole of Greece should be in the hands of the Allied Board at Athens, which should consult Salonika in regard to the requirements of Venizelist Greece. When the ration has been fixed, the Board should inform the Allied Governments when and&apos;&apos; where the cargoes require to be shipped. Formal requisitioning of these ships would come from the Royalist Government, but the actual selection of the vessels must be made in London. Sir F. Elliot, replying to the above, reported (4th February) that M. Venizelos desires to purchase wheat for Venizeiist Greece either through the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement or through the National Bank. His Majesty&apos;s Government has suggested the possibility of establishing a wheat reserve in one of the islands under Venizelist control.On 30th January the Greek Government formally requested that the. blockade might be&apos;raised, on the ground that the demands of the Powers, as laid down in the Notes of 8th and 13th January, hadbeen fulfilled. In this connection, Sir F. Elliot expressed the opinion that the demands should be regarded as met when all artillery and machine guns had been removed to the Morea. Meanwhile General Cauboue, in&apos;-a reply (30th January) to the Greek General Staff, refused the concessions recom-mended by the Military Attaches and Allied Ministers. Under instructions from -General Sarrail, he insisted on the-reduction of the Athens regiments to a strength of 640 men each, and upon the complete evacuation of Corfu, Eubcea, Santa Maura, Missolonghi, &amp;c. ; at the same - time putting forward several new demands. The general attitude of the French Military Authorities is still marked by evidences of animosity towards the Greek Government, which, nevertheless, continues to assure the Allied Ministers of its. loyal intention to carry out its own engagements, and General Sarraif&apos;s instructions, without delay. General Phillips, now at Athens, considers that there is no doubt that this is being done. On the other hand, the French Government desires that the attention of the Greek Government be drawn to the persistently hostile attitude of the Greek Press towards the Allies in general and the French in particular; and Sir F. Elliot (No. 346) telegraphing on 5th. February, describes the attitude of the reservists as unsatisfactory and therefore reconsiders his opinion as to the advisability of raising,.the blockade. He would limit supplier, for the present to wheat and coal.The Belgian, Roumanian, and Serbian Ministers have returned to Athens.His Majesty&apos;s Minister has suggested to the Greek Government the advisability of issuing a General Decree of Amnesty in favour of all Venizelists prosecuted by the Courts. The Prime Minister, in promising to consider the matter, remarked that the Provisional Government should release the Royalist hostages whom it still detains. The Venizelist Government is anxious to release these political prisoners before, being pressed to do so, but as some were arrested by the Allies, they cannot be set free without the consent of the Powers concerned. The matter of their release is now in process of arrangement with the French Government. The restoration of the status quo in favour of the Royalist regime in the island of Cerigo is also under discussion.The French Government having been informed that the German naval, and military attaches have returned-! to Athens, instructions were] sent (2nd February) j^to Sir F. Elliot to join with his French colleague in requesting the Greek Government to have them removed ; and at the same time to take similar steps in regard to the Austrian Consul at Janina. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir F. Elliot that the report of the German attaches&apos; return is a malevolent Venizelist invention and without foundation.The presence of two sets of Greek Consular authorities, each claiming separate jurisdiction under the capitulation system in Egypt, has led to a ridiculous situation ; but Sir F. Wingate, telegraphing on 3rd February, reports that the Venizelist authorities are now inclined to adopt a reasonable attitude. His Majcsty&apos;s Covein-ment has directed Lord Granville to intimate that all Venizelists in Egypt who object to being placed under the jurisdiction of Consuls appointed by the Royalist Government may place themselves under the protection of the General Officer Commanding.SWITZERLAND.The Federal Government considers that Swiss interests do not at present warrant taking action against Germany as suggested by President Wilsou&apos;s note to neutrals. A protest is being addressed to the Central Empires. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir H. Rumbold that the Federal Government decided on tha
2ad February to take,- charge of, German interests mi the United States if a rupture should occur.NETHERLANDS.The Netherlands Government has readily agreed to the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government that it should take charge of British interests in Germany. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at the Hague reports that the Netherlands Minister at Berlin has the reputation of being very pro-German.Sir A. John stone, telegraphing on the 4th February (No. 235), expresses the opinion that the Netherlands Government is not likely to do more than protest against German frightfulness, as the country&apos;s only weapon of offence is prohibition of the export of foodstuffs, which might lead to German invasion, and in any case stop the import of German coal, involving disaster to Holland. His Majesty&apos;? Minister anticipates that if, by reason of shipping difficulties, less agricultural produce should go to England, Germany may endeavour to reap- a corresponding advantage.Under instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government, Sir A. Johnstone informed the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs (1st February) that if the German destroyer is allowed to leave after repairing the damage inflicted by our ships, His Majesty?s Government will consider their action in the matter as quite unjustifiable, and not in accordance with principles of neutrality. Similarly, if the wounded men landed from the destroyer are not interned, His Majesty&apos;s Government Avill consider it a deliberate breach of international law.SWEDEN.The action of the United States in breaking off relations with Germany has created a profound impression throughout Sweden. The moral condemnation of Germany&apos;s conduct of the war, thereby implied, is generally recognised. In the opinion of Sir E. Howard this may produce a material change in the attitude of Sweden towards the Allies.The difficulty of importing coal from England is making Sweden more and more dependent on supplies from Germany.Sir E. Howard has been instructed (Foreign Office telegram No. 405 of 1st February) to endeavour to arrange that the British ships detained in the Sound and Baltic Ports should come out through the Kogrunds passage under the British flag; if this course presents insuperable difficulties, to arrange for their transfer to the Swedish flag, under conditions which would require to be formally recognised by the Swedish Government.A draft agreement has been discussed between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Swedish delegates at present in this country, having reference to the conditions under which certain classes of articles may be exported from Sweden; this agreement will be submitted to the Swedish Parliament for ratification in due course.NORWAY.The. shortage of coal is becoming acxite. Christiania&apos;s stocks are estimated as sufficient for one month.The political controversy concerning the policy of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (vide last week&apos;s summary) continues. The impression appears to be growing that this Minister^ interpretation of the copper agreement is largely to blame for the Governments present difficulties and that his retirement would be welcome. The Conservative party, convinced that he has acted upon some undisclosed arrangement with Germany, brought the matter to debate in v a secret session of Parliament (1st February) with results which Sir M. Findlay considers to amount to a reverse for the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.DENMARK.The Danish Government has informed the German Government that so long as Germany continues to torpedo Danish ships, no further licences will be given for export of horses to Germany. Also, that the prevention of direct export of agricultural produce to Great Britain will not be allowed to result in diverting a
larger proportion to Germany. It is proposed that Great Britain&apos;s share should be, sent by rail to Sweden and Norway for transmission, so as to dispose of the surplus produce held by farmers, and thus to forestall their opposition.SPAIN.It is understood that the Spanish Governments reply to the German submarine Note will take the form of a decided protest. Public opinion in Spain has been impressed by the declaration of Germany that their new tactics will compel their enemies to make peace within two months.His Majesty the King of Spain informed Sir A. Hardinge (3rd February) that, as a mark of his friendly feelings towards England he would be glad, if required, to take charge of British interests in enemy countries.The French Government has instructed its Ambassador at Madrid to urge the Spanish Government to follow the example of the United States by giving passports to the German Ambassador or, at least, to the German Naval and Military attaches.PORTUGAL.The Portuguese Government has asked His Majesty&apos;s Government for certain facilities (including the opening of a credit in London) for the purchase of wheat. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Lisbon is of opinion that a wheat famine is imminent ; at the same time he thinks the Portuguese Government should be obliged to pay for some of its purchases, and that, if financial assistance is provided for them, it should only be after a satisfactory arrangement has been come to in regard to ships and as an act of grace.Serious delays have occurred in regard to the departure of the Portuguese troops for France ; some of those embarked between the 18th and the 28th January being still in the Tagus. The Portuguese Government has drawn the attention of Plis Majesty&apos;? Government to the grave delays caused by insufficiency of transports, and requested an immediate reorganisation of the service. The Government also requests that the provisions of the Military Convention be respected, which prescribe the co-operation of the Portuguese Navy for escort of transports, &quot; since any other procedure would justify the wounded feelings of the nation.&quot; It appears that the route selected by the British Admiralty as a safe one is beyond the radius of activity of Portuguese destroyers, and that this would appear to have wounded Portuguese susceptibilities.CHINA.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington has been instructed to associate himself with the representatives of the Powers interested in the consortium,, which is about to negotiate a loan to China, and to concert with them as to the measures necessary to bring about the admission thereto of an American financial group.Sir C. Spring Rice in a Despatch of 5th February, states that official support by Ambassadors is inadvisable, inasmuch as the State Department has objected to the system of political loans. Meanwhile negotiations are proceeding between the financiers concerned.Mr. Alston (telegram No. 50 of 4th February) reports that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has enquired whether China could not be represented at the Peace Conference, if only in regard to the final disposal of Kiao Chao.Mr. Alston considers that, in view of Japan&apos;s new policy of active friendship for China, and the impending discussion at Tokyo of Japan&apos;s relations with China, the moment is opportune for the Allied diplomatists to persuade the Chinese Government to turn the Germans out of China. This would throw the whole country open to us for labour recruiting and eliminate German influence from the Far East.Under instructions from his Government, the United States Minister at Peking has invited the Chinese Government to follow the example of the United States by severing relations with Germany. Mr. Alston is of the opinion that the Japanese Minister to China and the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Tokyo are now in favour of China declaring herself on the side of the Allies.
JAPAN,Sir C. Greene, telegraphing on 2nd February (No: 71), reports the. arrangements which  &quot;the &quot;Japanese Governineht:have made&apos; for rendering naval assistance in the Mediterranean and elsewhere, including the despatch of two flotillas of destroyers. On the same clay, the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Tokyo informed His Majesty&apos;s representative that his Government no longer&apos;associated their action in this matter with a desire for an assurance from His Majesty,&apos;s Government in regard to the disposal of Germ any&apos;s rights in Shantung, and German possessions in /the islands north of the Equator, but hoped that His Maiesty&apos;s Government would take the latter into favourable consideration. Sir C. Greene was instructed (5th February) to state, that His Majesty&apos;s Government feel themselves bound to communicate, with certain of the Dominions on the subject, but will do their &quot;utmost to shorten the delay of their reply as much as possible.At the request of the Russian Government, it has been agreed to defer negotia-tions for the proposed British loan in Japan, so that the Russian loan may;take precedence.ARGENTINA.The question of requisitioning German and Austrian ships .in Argentine ports is being seriously discussed in Congress, it being understood that the like action is under consideration by. the Brazilian Government.MEXICO.His Majesty&apos;s representative has been instructed to observe the same attitude as that enjoined on the United States&apos; representative by the State Department, and to excuse himself from attending the ceremony of the promulgation of the new constitution on. the 5th of February. Mr. Thurstan considers that the legislation incorporated in the new Constitution will ruin every industry in the country, if enforced.Mr. Thurstan reports (5th February) that conditions are critical for the Carranza Government; communications with Vera Cruz suspended.COSTA RICA.President Gonzalez having been deposed, a Provisional Government has been formed, which has sent a delegate to Washington to ask for recognition. The new administration is strongly pro-Ally, and His Mai.esty&apos;s Government is disposed to recognise it as soon as possible.UNITED STATES.Sir C. Spring Rice reports (6th February)  an  extraordinary manifestation:: of-patriotism and. pro-Ally feeling.   German-Americans are proclaiming their loyalty-to the States, and there is no evidence of dissatisfaction among the Irish.   At the same time, if the United States become involved in hostilities,  there will always be a strong opposition to an &quot; English war.&quot;The State Department, being extremely anxious to get rid of the staff of the German Embassy and Consulates, has asked that special permission be given for a Danish vessel carrying them to proceed vice the Northern route, avoiding Kirkwall, and undergoing examination at Halifax.Some anxiety has been caused at Washington by the Japanese Ambassadors protest against State land legislation, and the State Department has remonstrated with the Senators concerned.   (Sir C. Spring Rice&apos;s telegram 266, of 2nd February.)All Germans in the Panama Canal zone and. the crews of the German vessels at Colon have been interned by the United States Military Authorities,PEACE DISCUSSIONS.On the day before the severance of diplomatic relations between the United. States and Germany, Sir C. Spring Rice reported Colonel tlouse to have stated that the United States Government was in possession of the German peace terms, which, would not be acceptable to the Allies.
-       THE GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.It is clear that one of the principal objects of the German Government, in promulgating its declaration of ruthless submarine activity, was to secure at least a temporary intimidation of neutral shipping and suspension of trade between Scandinavia and Great Britain. The advantages and moral effect of even a temporary stoppage of neutral traffic during a period of uncertainty have been fully explained in the Lokalanzeiger, whose anticipations would appear to have been to-some extent justified by the course of events. Germany&apos;s intentions of frightfulness have been deliberately exaggerated at Christiania, Stockholm, Rotterdam and other ports,, for the purpose of intimidating shipowners and crews, and thus bringing such pressure to bear on neutral Governments as would induce them to endeavour to obtain a relaxation of the British blockade. The German Naval Attache at Christiania announced, for instance, that his Government intends to reinforce the submarine campaign by the scattering of mines near Kirkwall and other ports of call. In Holland, the German insurance companies were directed to announce that ihey would accept no further risks on neutral vessels. At Stockholm, the German Naval Attache announced that his Government were possessed of 4-00 submarines ; and so on. The first effect of this propaganda was to create a general condition of nervousness and hesitation. In Sweden, it found expression in a hasty decision of the War Insurance Commission (1st February) not to give insurance to vessels going to England or France. From Holland, from Scandinavia and from the United States, urgent representations were made to His Majesty&apos;s Government, asking that ships might be relieved of the obligation to call at- a British or Allied Port for examination. But the&quot; absence, of nervousness in the matter of insurance in London, the rupture between the United States and Germany, and the prospect of arrangements being-made in the near future for protected trade routes, all tended to produce a calmer outlook. On the 3rd February the Swedish Government decided to pass a Bill through Parliament without delay, so as to enable the War Insurance Commission to insure ships&apos; crews, &amp;c. On the 5th, the Norwegian Minister at Stockholm was engaged in. discussing with the Swedish Government a form of common protest to be made, in concert with Copenhagen, against the German blockade.To counteract the pressure thus brought to bear by Germany on. neutral ship-owners, His Majesty&apos;s Government, in consultation with the Allied Powers, has taken certain steps with the main object of securing that neutral vessels engaged in Allied trades should not be laid up or leave those trades. To this end, and in order to allow time for elaborating a scheme to meet the situation, instructions were issued to the Dominions and Colonies for the detention of all neutral vessels other than American or ships trading to or from American waters ; negotiations were simultaneously\eously opened to secure the continuance of these vessels in trade. Certain protests followed. In reply to that which was lodged by the Minister for the Nether-lands, Sir Robert Cecil pointed out that the situation was unprecedented and. that His Majesty&apos;s Government were entitled to give it a few days&apos; careful consideration. On the 5th. it was decided to release all Spanish ships, it being understood that the policy of the Spanish Government is to maintain its trade with the Allied countries. As regards the other neutral shipping concerned-, His Majesty&apos;s Government decided i!pon taking the following steps : (1) Ships on time-charter to Allied charterers and ships trading between Allied countries are being released, but each case is being dealt with on its merits, care being taken to obtain guarantees that vessels released do not seek shelter in neutral ports.(2) Neutral ships in Allied trades, if actually bound for a neutral port (e.g., trade . between United Kingdom and Scandinavia) are only being released if fixed(U./ back to(Allied port with important cargo, and only as and when similar&apos; ships arrive in British ports.   The object is to ensure that the number of neutral vessels actually in British ports is maintained.(3) Terms have been drawn up in which offers of purchase or charter can be made to neutral owners. Purchases will be made by His-Majesty&apos;s Government, \ easels purchased being allocated pro rata to Allied Governments.(4) Offers of War Insurance are being made to meet the temporary emergency. It is trusted that French and Italian Governments will agree to share cost of this, as already agreed in regard to Norwegian Insiirance.
GENERAL.In reference to a note verbale from Berlin communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Government through the United States&apos; Ambassador on the 27th January, concerning the alleged employment of German prisoners of war close behind the British lines in France, the Netherlands Government has been requested to inform the German Government that Great Britain is prepared to undertake not to employ German prisoners of war within 20 kilometres of the British front line in return for a similar undertaking by Germany; this undertaking to apply equally to the eastern and western fronts.The German Government has instructed the Belgian Relief Commission that its relief ships must proceed by the northern route. In this connection Sir W. Townley has been directed (5th February) to inform the Commission at Rotterdam that there is no safe route, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government is aware, between the Faroes and Rotterdam, as the narrow passage left between the German war zonej and the zone declared dangerous by His Majesty&apos;s Government is blocked by an area which has been proclaimed dangerous by the Dutch.Steps have been taken, in consultation with Paris and Rome, to -check the endeavours which Germany is making to withdraw her balances from&apos; the United States through neutral European banks, which clear the transactions&apos; in London.7th February 1917.(5) Vessels engaged in central trades, which have called at United Kingdom ports for examination, are being released, except those carrying grain, nitrate, fodder and other important cargoes to Denmark and Holland. It is intended to insist that vessels shall continue to call for examination.
