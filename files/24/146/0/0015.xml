SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED  WESTERN&quot;  AND GENERALREPORT, No. 15.Grkecjs.Both the French and M. Venizelos seem determined to frustrate King Constantiue&apos;s efforts to gain our goodwill by concessions. The great Salonika demonstration, was presumably organised for this purpose, and the next few weeks will no doubt produce a crop of &quot; incidents &quot; calculated to exasperate the Royalists or afford pretexts for interference. Meanwhile, General sarrail&apos;s activities are, for the time being, happily absorbed in the offensive in the Monastir region.Serwa.The unrest in the Serbian Army is a serious symptom. No Army has under-gone so much ; the longing of officers and men for home is becoming almost unbearable, and is skilfully played on by the enemy; they cordially dislike the French under whose command they are, and feel that they are merely being used as tools to be thrown away when they have served their purpose. Unless they receive some very definite pledge from this country that we mean to look after the reconstruction of Serbia at the end of the war, there is a very real danger that they may lose heart entirely, and desert in large numbers.German Affairs.The German Chancellor is playing a difficult game. In order to try and use the German Socialists to lure the Russian Socialists into a separate peace, he has to profess a readiness to accept terms which, unsatisfactory as they are from the point of view of the Allies, are equally unsatisfactory to militant public opinion in Germany. But he, no doubt, reckons that if Russia can once be detached the military position will be so transformed that he can then stiffen up his terms against the other Allies ; if, on the other hand, Russia refuses to be seduced, then the German Socialists will be exasperated and ready to support the German Government to the end.The readiness to cede Metz to the French is significant of the anxiety to placate French feeling by something that would make the &quot;honours easy&quot; as between Germany and France at the end of the war. if it were not for the immense value of the iron fields Germany would probably- be willing to cede the whole of Lorraine. On the other hand, German opinion seems, if anything, to be hardening on the necessity of retaining some measure of control over Flemish Belgium and the Flemish coast.Austrian Affairs.The recent settlement of the Austrian internal crisis and the withdrawal of the resignations of the German Ministers clearly indicate that there is no real attempt on the part of Austria to break loose from the German connection or to think of a separate
peace. At Stockholm the Austrian Socialist representatives will, no doubt, play np even harder than their German colleagues to convince the Russians of the sincerity of their willingness for a &quot; peace without annexation.&quot;Sweden.The internal crisis in Sweden seems to be developing. Attempts on the part of the Russian extremists to foster Swedish working class discontent arc likely to throw the governing classes back into an increasingly anti-Russian frame of mind.L. S. A.10th May 1917.

PART I -BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.With regard to the Resolution:ii passed by the Imperial War Conference that steps should be taken to secure the assent of the Dominion Governments to the repre-sentation of India at future Imperial Conferences, the Government of New Zealand have telegraphed their cordial agreement to the suggestion of future Indian representation.Arising out of the Resolution passed by the Imperial War Conference in favour of the establishment of an Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau,* it is intended to set up a small Committee to work out the constitution and functions of the Bureau. The Commonwealth Government have been informed to this effect, and have been asked to nominate an expert representative to help the Committee..GENERAL.In response to the suggestion&quot;* that the Dominion Governments should adopt the same policy as the United Kingdom, and only license exports to Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland if carried in ships owned by the country of ultimate destination, the Governments of Canada and New Zealand have both telegraphed that they will adopt the policy indicated.CANADA.The repby of the Dominion Government to the enquiry of the Admiralty as to the supply of Canadian labour for British shipbuilding yards,* states that the recruiting of men from Dominion yards for this purpose would cause considerable delay in the execution of orders which are now being carried out for the Ministry of Shipping, and for the Canadian Naval Service. It is further mentioned that the Canadian yards are arranging to repair about 25 lake steamers in order to equip them for ocean traffic.In telegraphing to the Dominion regarding the requisitioning of vessels, the Secretary of State has informed the Canadian Government that there is a great shortage of ships which will he wanted during the next few months for the most essential necessities of the United Kingdom, both military and civil, it is, there-fore, pointed out that there is urgent need of releasing all British ocean steamers for Government work, and of replacing them by American or neutral vessels.AUSTRALIAN commonwealth the results of the Commonwealth Elections give the Nationalists (supporters of the Coalition Government of Air. Hughes and Mr. Cook) substantial majorities over the official Labour Party (supporters of Mr. Tudor) in both Houses of the Federal Parliament. The telegrams sent to the Press show that in the House of Representa-tives the Nationalists will have a majority of 25 (as against 23 in the last Parliament), while in the Senate they will have a majority of 10 (instead of a minority of 1 as in the last Parliament). The Coalition Ministry formed by Air. Hughes in February lastf is thus maintained in office..   * See Western and General Report for week ending&apos;25th April 1917. t See Western and General Report for week ending 21st February 1917.
The Commonwealth. Government have inquired if the United States have any objection to American citizens joining the Australian Army, as many are anxious to enlist in this way.The Secretary of State has telegraphed to the Commonwealth Government the terms of reference to the Committee which has been appointed by the Air Board to report respect^on the post-war development of aviation for civil purposes, and has asked if an Australian representative can be nominated to serve upon the Committee.With reference to the report that a title has been conferred upon an Australian officer, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has telegraphed a protest against such steps being taken without reference to the Australian Government. . It is intimated that a practice of this character is likely to alfect injuriously the principles of autonomy in the Dominions.As to the suggested 3,000,0007. advance by the Commonwealth Government to the States from the moneys lent by the British Treasury for war purposes,* the Treasury have replied that they have no objection to the course suggested on condition that it is only regarded as a temporary banking measure, and that the account between&apos; war advances and other funds will be set right when the next loan is raised to meet capital expenditure.With reference to the enquiry of the Governor-General on the subject,! the Secretary of State has conveyed the assurance that the skilled workers now being recruited in the Commonwealth for munition work will not be made liable for active service on arrival in the United Kingdom.An intimation has been conveyed to the Commonwealth Government that military necessities do not demand the importation of Australian leather, and therefore that this cannot be permitted on account of the consequent interference with the shipment of essential material.The Referendum on the proposed abolition of. the Queensland Legislative Council has been declared by the Supreme Court of that State to be illegal. Appeal is &apos;being made to the High Court of the Australian Commonwealth, and meantime the Queensland Government are continuing their arrangements for taking the vote by ballot.As it has been found that the shipping position will not admit of the transport of an amount even approximating to 30,000 tons of flour per month, the Secretary of State has suggested that, while the greatest quantity possible should be milled, the flour should be stored until further vessels are available.MEW ZEALAND.In reply to inquiries, the Admiralty have informed the Dominion Government that though the safety of hospital ships is a matter of the utmost importance, these ships cannot be escorted without violating the Hague Convention.SOUTH: AFRICA.With the object of increasing the supply of food to the United Kingdom, the Union Government point out the position in South Africa with regard to various commodities. As to maize, the balance of the surplus crop of 191.7, not already purchased for the British Government through traders, will amount to about 2,000,000 bags, and the Union authorities have already agreed to buy this for the United Kingdom. If a price of about 13-s. per bag f.o.b. could be offered by June for the 1918 crop, there would be a considerable increase in the area devoted to the production of maize. Large quantities of potatoes and eggs could be sent ; and, if further cold storage freight were available, the weekly amount of 3,000 tons of meat, which is now being despatched, could be increased. South Africa is now taking some wheat from Australia, and if this would otherwise go to the United Kingdom, the Union Government express their willingness to cut down their demands from this source.* See yVestern and General Reports for weeks ending 28th. March, 18th and 25th ApriR and 2nd May t See Western and General Report for week ending ISth April 1917.
The Union Government, in the belief that auxiliary cruisers, engaged in convoy work, return home empty, suggest that those vessels, having both space and cold storage accommodation, might be utilised for the transport of perishable food. Recognising that the ships could not be kept in port for any particular time, in order to admit of loading, the South African authorities suggest that meat, potatoes, maize, &amp;c. could be kept ready for shipment at a few hours notice, and that the loading could be stopped at any moment, in case the ship had to leave, and the balance of foodstuffs kept until the next ordinary steamer sailed.RHODESIA.After a prolonged debate, a Resolution, moved by the Treasurer, stating that it is desirable that Northern and Southern Rhodesia should be administered as one territory, has been passed by the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia by nine (six nominated, and three elected, members) to six (all elected members).The second Rhodesian. Regiment, which returned to Rhodesia after service in East Africa, will be ready for duty again at the beginning of July. The hope is expressed by the Administration that, after a period of training in the United Kingdom, the regiment may be despatched to France to serve with an Imperial unit.EAST AFRICA PROTECTORATE.With further reference to legislation on the lines of the Munitions of War Act, 1915,&quot;* the officer administering the Government has telegraphed that he is accepting the principle of that Act, but is adding a penalty for an employee who leaves his employment and sets up on iris own.The Secretary of State has informed the Governor! that, owing to the serious danger to the home food supply, it has become necessary to prevent all food exportation from the United Kingdom, the only exceptions being the foods which are indispensable and which cannot possi bly be procured els ewhere.NYASALAND.The Governor points out the urgency^ of removing the German prisoners on account of the advance of the German forces into Portuguese East Africa and towards Nyasaland.CEYLON.&apos;As the Army Council are desirous of knowing the rnubable number of white recruits obtainable in the Colonies, the Governor has been asked for information as to those who can be spared from Ceylon. It is suggested that a Commission should be set up to enquire into cases of fit men who wish to volunteer but whom employers consider indispensable, as such Commissions have been appointed by the Straits Settlements, the Malay States and Hong Kong.* See Western and General Report for week ending 2nd May 1917.t Similar information has been telegraphed-to the Governors of Uganda, Zanzibar, Nyasaland, Falkland Islands and to Eastern Colonies, &amp;c.2962-2B
part II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ITALY.At a Cabinet meeting held -in Rome on 4th May, it was decided that the Minister of the Interior should proceed to London to submit the facts of the very grave situation caused by the shortage of coal. During April the total amount received was 350,000 tons, or less than half the irreducible minimum of consumption, so that it was necessary to use practically half of the reserve stock. If the rest has to be consumed in May, the work of munitions factories and the movement of troops will be compromised.Sir R. Rodd has been instructed to point out to the Italian (lovernment that their action in allowing the free export of tussah silk (an article of direct military utility) constitutes a direct violation of the agreement made in Paris last September. His Majesty&apos;s Government had requested information on the subject at the end of January, and. are surprised at the Italian authorities&apos; delay in supplying it. Pending further discussion of the subject at the forthcoming Conference in Paris, it is hoped that these exports to the enemy will be stopped. The Conference will meet on 14th May. &apos; ABELGIUM.Later information supplied by the Commission on the subject of the torpedoing of relief ships leads to the conclusion that it would be difficult to prove that any of the vessels in question were actually attacked within the proclaimed safety zone. For this reason and others, His Majesty&apos;s Government have reconsidered their decision to suspend the sailing of relief ships from America to Rotterdam. They are now being allowed to proceed and their captains strictly warned to keep within the safety zone.A report has been received by the War Office that the Germans have seized three months&apos; supplies collected&apos;at Lens by the American Committee of the Belgian Relief Commission.   Steps are being taken to verify this report.GREECE.The attitude of King Constantino evinces a disposition to come to terms with the Allies, and to repress the pro-German activities of the Reservists and General Staff. On 1st May he sent his Court Marshal to Sir F. Elliot to assure him of the Greek Government&apos;s desire to maintain friendly relations with the Entente.. The Marshall renewed the King&apos;s assurances that since the beginning of the war he had received no letter from the German Emperor except the one guaranteeing the restitution of Greek territory occupied by the Bulgarians. The Greek Government, he said, had no feelings against the Entente except in so far as they feared a movement in favour of restoring M. &quot;Venizelos to power. On 2nd May the King sent for M. Zaimis, and entrusted him with the formation of a new Cabinet. The new Government was sworn in oil the 4th. , Five of its members held office in the last Zaimis Cabinet, and several are relations of the Prime Minister. Sir F. Elliot describes it as a &quot;colourless&quot; administration ; he has doubts as to the suitability of the appointment of Colonel Charalambis as Minister of War.&quot;:;:&quot; but-M. Zaimis declares that he will deal firmly with the General Staff. Seven superior officers, including two of the General Staff, were ordered to Morea on the 8th ; this created some excitement in military circles, but the King&apos;s wishes were conveyed to a meeting of the Military Club that the orders, of the* Press reports published since the above was written state that Colonel Charalambis lias declined the appointment.
Government should be obeyed.   The Prime Minister has assured Sir F. Elliot that he intends to pursue a policy of pacification ; he hopes that M. Venizelos will co-operate with him in that policy by restraining the violence of the Salonika Press and the Republican proclivities of his followers.   Sir F. Elliot believes that the King and his party are i now sincerely convinced that their only salvation lies in gaining the goodwill of \ Engl and, and.  that they are  therefore ready to do anything that His Majesty&apos;s &apos;   Government may desire, even to become reconciled with M. Venizelos.   With this end in view, Sir F. Elliot recommends that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take the lead in directing the policy of the Allies in Greece.M. Venizelos, on the other hand, shows no desire to adopt a policy of: conciliation. On 3rd May he saw Lord Granville and, speaking with great vehemence, urged, that the Allies should either occupy Thessaly (so as to prevent the Royalists from seizing the harvest) or allow the Provisional Government to- do so. He is convinced of the necessity for &quot; clearing up &quot; the situation in Greece at once and without awaiting the end of the war, asserting that if he were in possession, of Thessaly, the King&quot; would, give up the game and go. Once established at Athens, he would undertake to provide an army of 12 divisions in three months. Lord Granville, commenting on. this interview, expresses the opinion that M. Venizelos lias been prompted to this policy by General Sarrail, but believes that he will take no active steps so long as His Majesty&apos;s Government disapprove. Sir F. Elliot regards the policy -proposed by M. Venizelos as &quot; unworthy of his large and far-seeing statesmanship &quot; ; he holds that, as His Majesty&apos;s Governments desire is to pursue a tranquillising policy towards Royalist Greece, M. Venizelos should be persuaded to exercise a restraining influence upon his revolutionary friends.A. search for hidden arms in a village near Athens on 3rd May resulted, in the dis-covery of 480 new Mannlicher rifles, bearing the Government mark, and 117,000 rounds of ammunition. In this connection Sir F. Elliot reports (7th May), on the authority of General Phillips, that the French Military Control have decided to leave the further finding of hidden rifles to the Greek Government, while reserving to themselves full liberty of action. They- claim to have knowledge of many more (the number has been reported as 80,000), and propose that the Greek Government shall be judged, by the number produced. General Phillips believes that if all the hidden arms were handed over and all &quot; occult government &quot; influences discarded, the French military party would still remain unsatisfied. They convey the impression that the accession of M. Zaimis is a source of disappointment in that it compels them to find other pretexts for forcible measures. While the French Minister, under instructions, maintains an attitude of reserve, they openly advocate the occupation of Greece and the dethrone-rnent of the King. General. Mas not only inspires but, writes articles for the Press in this sense ; Sir F. Elliot observes that this attitude is calculated to create serious embarrassment for the Allied representatives.Encouraged no doubt by these political activities, a number of. shipowners and other rich adherents of M. Venizelos have subscribed a loan of nearly 1,000,000Z. at 5 per cent, for the purposes of the Provisional Government. Popular enthusiasm for the cause and hostility to the King have also been manifested by a mass meeting field at Salonika on 0th Slay, when some 30,000 Nationalists passed resolutions in. favour of the deposition of the King, begging the Allied Government to cease recognition of the Government at Athens and urging the Provisional Government to effect mobilisation in Macedonia. Lord Granville reports that the first resolution, as originally drafted, only called for the deposition of the King, but, in compliance with popular clamour, the Mayor, who was presiding, added the words &quot; and his dynasty.&quot; A procession marched to the house of M. Venizelos, but he was purposely absent. The crowd was received by SI. Phiiaretos, chief of the Political Cabinet and a republican of 50years standing, who made a speech declaring that the will of the people must prevail. For thus exceeding his functions he was severely called, to task, and his resignation demanded, by M. Veuizelos, who explained to Lord. Granville that his first and immediate object is the reunion of Greece. A Republic, demanded by the will of the people, might come in time, but in the meanwhile discipline must be maintained.The Italian Ambassador, representing the Italian Government at the Conference ^vith Mr. Lloyd George in Paris on 4-th May, was instructed, as regards the Greek situation, to sustain the general lines laid down at the Conference at St. Jean d.e Maurienne, namely (1) the adoption of all measures necessary to the safety of the Allied forces ; (2) no provocation of a crisis in Greece, and (3) the retention of the Dynasty and. present Constitution, should circumstances or events necessitate the abdication of King Constantine.
sThe Provisional Government have made confidential representations at Petrograd, Paris, and London concerning the proceedings of the Italians at Corfu, and have urged an increase of the Trench garrison and the sending of British and Russian detachments to the island. As the result of these representations, the Russian General, at Salonika was instructed from headquarters to consult with Lord Granville and his French colleague and to take measures accordingly. With reference to this matter, Sir R. Rodd reported (4th May) that the Italian Government would welcome a British detachment at Corfu, as their presence would be likely to obviate the existing tendency to friction between the French and Italian Commanders. He anticipated no objection to Russia being represented (as proposed) by a party of convalescents, but any increase of the French garrison would arouse immediate suspicion,A satisfactory arrangement has been concluded in regard to the receipts of the Salonika customs, which are to be deposited, as from 1st January 1917, in the name of the International Financial Commission at Athens. The Commission expect by this arrangement to assure payment of the September coupon of the 1914 loan.The Allied representatives addressed a collective Note to the Greek Government; on 2nd May calling for the re-establishment of the Controls.The Minister of Supplies at Athens has addressed an urgent appeal to Sir F. Elliot for supplies of grain to last until the next wheat ship arrives from America. No steamer can be expected before the end of May at earliest, and for the next three weeks the only breadstuff available for Royalist Greece will be 800 tons of maize and 1,000 tons of rice, expected from Egypt about the 20th. Sir F. Elliot suggests diverting one or two wheat cargoes, as a loan, from the Suez Canal or Port Said, or that the British and French Governments might appeal to M. Venizelos to lend to Royalist Greece a portion of a cargo now due to arrive at Salonika.SERBIA.A memorandum by Colonel Harrison, lately Military Attache in Serbia, states that the Serbian Army is profoundly agitated by reason of the recent arrest and trial of Serbian officers, and the imprisonment of a number of most enlightened officials at the hands of the group of reactionaries now in power. Furthermore, that the kindred Slav peoples are. greatly incensed at the treatment accorded to these men, who were looked to as the leaders of the new Serbia of the future ; that the situation is extremely serious and may lead to a revolution, in which case not only will the cause of Serbia be in jeopardy, but the position of the Allies at Salonika must suffer. Sir C. des Graz (Corfu) has been directed by the Foreign Office to express his views on the actual situation.The Serbian Government, desiring to be nearer to the Prince Regent and Army, propose to move from Corfu to Nyausta, north-west of Verria. If the Minister for War approves of the site selected, the Serbian Government will ask that Nyausta be made ex-territorial, as in the case of Havre.GERMAN   AFFAIRS.The reports received (mostly through Holland) during the past week all point to the imminence of a decisive struggle between the Chancellor and the parties of the Left against the Military party, the Industrials and Conservatives. The Chancellors doubts and difficulties were stated in a very significant manner to the correspondent of the &quot; Daily Mail&quot; at the Plague on 3rd May by Herr Guttmann, formerly London correspondent of the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung.&quot; The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; correspondent was not authorised to publish this interview, from which Sir W. Townley infers that its purpose was diplomatic. According to Herr Guttmann, the Chancellor is anxious to make peace on terms which would include the retrocession of part of Lorraine, including Metz, but he seeks above all, guarantees that the Allies will not boycott or restrict German trade after the war. (There is evidently much anxiety in Germany on this score. A British Imperial Zollverein, says the &quot; Leipziger Zeitung,&quot; would be a very serious blow to Germany ; opinion in commercial circles, however, inclines generally to the belief that no effective measures will be taken against &quot; peaceful penetration.&quot;) The Chancellor recognises that the submarine campaign will never succeed in reducing the Allies, through England, to starvation ; on the other hand, the Military party-continue to declare that the German front on the West is unbreakable. His prospects of overcoming his opponents depend therefore largely on the events of the immediate
future on that front. At present, according to Herr Guttmann, he is not strong enough to obtain support for peace proposals on the basis of the status quo ante. His position has been weakened, and that of the Military party correspondingly strengthened hy the declarations of Allied orators concerning the overthrow of the Hohenzollerns, the dismemberment of Austria, &amp;c.The significance of this ballon d&apos;essai lies chiefly in the fact that Herr Guttmann is associated with the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung,&quot; the OhancelloFs organ; this most influential paper plainly foreshadows in other ways the impending struggle between : the Junker party and the Left. The Junker Press continues to taunt the Chancellor with his democratic proclivities, and to denounce the &quot; without annexation or indemnities &quot; peace programme of the Socialists. If the parties of the Right, succeed in the com in a: trial of strength, the Chancellor will go under, and with him the Democrats&apos; demands for parliamentary and electoral reforms.The immediate object of the Pan-German or &quot; annexation&quot; groups (which include the National Liberals and the Conservatives) is to compel the Chancellor to show his hand. The Social Democrats are evidently just as anxious to make him declare himself in favour of peace without annexations. According to the &quot; Kolnische Zeitung &quot; it is his intention to remain firmly seated on the fence, pending further developments. Put the issue is clear-cut, and, judging by the tone of the Press, cannot long be avoided. The recent joint manifesto of the Pan-Germans, Agrarians arid Industrial Associations frankly declares &quot;we require compensation for the &quot; enormous sacrifices that our people have made, so that we may rebuild our &quot; economic and social life, restore our civilisation after a victorious peace, and afford &quot; relief to our veterans and the families of our fallen, heroes. We require increase &quot; of territory and of power, better protection for our frontiers, an. increase of naval &quot; strength and the promotion of our industries hy increased production of raw &quot;materials. We need land for our settlers, in order to strengthen the nation and to &quot; provide increase of food and. supplies.&quot; Count Reventlow, speaking to this text on 4th May, denounced &quot; Scheidemamds peace&quot; as involving Germany in the payment of 11 to 15 milliards of marks a year. If, he added, Germany is to prevent the opening of peace negotiations under the worst possible conditions for the country &quot;our inner politics must take a new direction. A strong hand is needed..&quot; In his opinion &quot;the Monarchy is at stake.   It stands or falls by a (lerman peace.&quot;Socialism as an article for export to Russia is being encouraged, however, by the German Government. A recent report states that they are educating a large number of Russian peasant prisoners of war in socialistic doctrines, with the intention, of allowing them to return home, when their education is complete, to stir up internal strife in Russia.Information supplied by two British officers recently escaped from Germany goes to show that subscriptions to the war loan were exacted either from battalions as units, or from individual soldiers serving with garrison forces or at prisoners&apos; camps, by sending to the front those who refused or were unable to subscribe. The same officers state that the popular hatred of France and England has been very generally replaced in the German army by the conviction that the war was entirely engineered by their own Government.Germany&apos;s concern for her trade after the Avar is shown by the decision of the Government to place no restrictions on Chinese students continuing their courses at the Universities and technical high Schools.AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.The interview of the united German parties .with the Emperor Charles on 19th April seems to have had the desired effect. The reconstruction of the Austrian political system on German, lines was practically promised. On 25th ApHl the Government undertook without delay to deal with the question of the exclusion of Galicia (necessary in order to secure the Germans a majority in the Reichsrath) and foreshadowed financial and economic concessions (i.e., squared the Poles to secure their consent to exclusion). The two German Ministers, Dr. Baernreither and Dr. Urban, as Avell as the Minister for Galicia, Dr. Bobrzynski, thereupon withdrew their resignations. The Germans, it would seem, have in fact secured, guarantees that they will get what they want, but the open Germanization of the Austrian constitution has been postponed to. facilitate the Stockholm, peace negotiations.2962-2 C
Switzerland&quot;.Oh 3rd May His Majesty&apos;s Government notified Lord Bertie, for the information of the British delegates negotiating in Paris, that they had approved the Swiss cattle-export agreement (vide last Report). As regards the reserved rationing groups connected with the cattle agreement (vide- Report No. 13), the Swiss delegates requested, as a matter of urgency, that these matters might be settled before their departure from Paris on 8th May, The British delegates, who transmitted this request to the Foreign Office on 4th May, were instructed in reply7 not to support -without reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government any proposal to which. M. Grobet might be strongly opposed.On 8th May Sir H. Rumbold reported from. Berne that the delegates had drafted a joint Note to the Swiss Government notifying approval of the agreement,, subject to certain reservations suggested, by the Italian Government. The text of Notes to be exchanged will now be determined in consultation with the Swiss Government.Sir H. Rumbold reported on 3rd May that the German Swiss agreement was about to be signed and that its terms were generally more advantageous to Switzerland than the previous agreement.HOLLAND.Sir W. Townley has suggested (3rd May) that, in view of the serious apprehensions-prevailing in. official Dutch circles with regard to food supplies from. America, the moment is opportune for insisting that the Netherlands Government should take steps to put an end to frontier smuggling. Heretofore they have ignored representations on the subject, arguing that such smuggling is a purely domestic affair and no concern of the Allies.SWEDEN.The generally unsatisfactory manner in which the Swedish Government have interpreted the Fish Agreement with Great Britain has recently been aggravated by the export of a quantity of preserved fish, which constitutes a flagrant violation of the Convention. Under the circumstances, as reported, by Sir E. Howard, His Majesty&apos;e Government propose to withhold from the Swedish Government the balance of Norwegian herrings to which they would have been entitled under the agreement had its obligations been duly fulfilled on their side.On 4th May Sir E. Howard informed the Foreign Office that the Swedish Government had accepted the reciprocal arrangements proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government (vide last Report) in connection with the release of British shipping from, the Baltic and Swedish tonnage from British ports. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stipulated, however, that his Government could not be responsible for the safety of British ships beyond the limits of Swedish, territorial waters nor for difficulties that might arise in the matter of finding crews for them. Under this arrangement, which Sir E. Howard was authorised (7th May) to conclude by an exchange of Notes, 15 Swedish ships will, be released forthwith from ports in the United Kingdom, and 19 others, grain-laden, will gradually be given facilities for proceeding from America to Sweden, so long as the Swedish Government continue to facilitate and protect British and Allied ships leaving the Baltic by the Kogrunds Channel.Sir E. Howard&apos;s proposed solution of the Russian transit trade difficulty (allowing the Swedish Government to purchase a certain proportion of goods now in transit.) has been pronounced impracticable by the- Russian delegates of the C.I.R., owing, to the fact that most of these goods are the property of private consignees.A Government Bill will shortly be laid before the Riksdag, providing, for&quot; civil conscription,&quot; nominally applicable to all. persons, of both sexes, between ages of 15 and 60. The chief immediate objects of this measure are to secure an adequate-supply of labour for the cutting, of the large stock of firewood required by next: autumn, and to retain workmen in occupations of national importance. The Bill is supported by the Conservative Press, regarded with suspicion. by -the moderate-: Socialists, and violently opposed by the extreme Socialists and large bodies of the working classes.There have been further food riots at Stockholm and Gothenburg, resulting in, serious disturbances and a certain amount of shop looting. , .:-
SPAIN.The 33 per cent, stipulation in regard to iron-ore shipments has now been suspended, but the Cortina agreement remains unratified by the Spanish Government, who, under German intimidation, declare that in its present form it would need to be sanctioned by the Cortes, which would involve a delay of several weeks. They have therefore suggested embodying its provisions in an exchange of Notes, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed, on condition that the substance of the conventionNORWAY.While courteously declining the proposed Conference for naAuil co-operation, the Norwegian Government are apparently anxious to make such defensive preparations against attacks by aircraft as can be arranged without attracting undue attention. They do not favour the suggestion that British officers should be sent to advise the Minister for National Defence on the location of aerodromes, &amp;c, but are availing themselves of the advice of Flight Commander Rutland, who recently made a forced descent off the Danish coast, and is now in Christiania. They also suggest sending two Norwegian Flying Corps officers to study the working of the British aeroplane in England. The proposed supply of aeroplanes and anti-aircraft guns to the Norwegian authorities remains conditional on the satisfactory conclusion of the tonnage negotiations, still under discussion.DENMARK.Sir R. Paget has been directed to draw the serious attention of the Danish Government to the laxity of their restrictions on the transit of fish landed by Sweden in Denmark and re-exported to Germany. They are to be warned that, if these exports continue in excess of the authorised 2,000 tons a month, His Majesty&apos;s Government will not hesitate to cut off all supplies of oil even at the cost of dislocating the public services in Denmark. According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Danish fishing fleet is now supplied with German oil, and he has informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister that he is not prepared to limit the export of fish unless assured of a regular supply of oil from the United States, which will not be forth-coming unless the United States Government allow the transfer of American tank steamers to the Danish&quot; flag.Owing to the pressure brought to bear on the Danish Government by farmers, on the one hand, and by the German Government on the other, the exports to Germany of live stock and agricultural produce continue to show large increases. Sir R. Paget, under instructions, has made further representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is preparing a Memorandum on the subject. German pressure has recently been intensified hy the seizure of two Danish produce boats in the Cattegat and their detention in a German port. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has protested at Berlin and hopes to secure their release, but in shipping circles it is believed that their seizure indicates a change of German policy which will make it increasingly difficult to ship produce to the United Kingdom. For the present, the sailing of produce boats has been suspended. M. Andersen anticipates that this will lead to increased home consumption and larger exports to Norway and Sweden, but that none of the British share&apos;will be diverted to Germany. Recent returns are not of a nature to justify this assumption. Sir R. Paget has been directed to intimate, that, if produce traffic should be suspended for any length of time, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be compelled to apply pressure again by refusing clearances and facilities to Danish shipping.He has also been instructed to inform Mr. Andersen that, in view of the personal assurances given by him to Lord Robert Cecil, His Majesty&apos;s Government regard with great misgiving the present alarming growth of Danish exports to Germany; moreover, he should know that there is already a very strong feeling in England against the leniency shown by His Majesty&apos;s Government to Denmark in the face of these greatly increased exports to the enemy.On 4th May the &quot; Social Democrat &quot; published a statement to the effect that, on account of the shortage of materials for the making of margarine, the Agricultural Committee had directed to consider the advisability of restricting the export of lard, butter, &amp;c. The Minister for Foreign. Affairs informed Sir R. Paget that this paragraph had been published by his own instructions.
be not altered. Sir A. Hardinge reports that the new Government are really unwilling to ratify the agreement ; they are more afraid than their predecessors of the pro-German party, who are opposing &quot;ratification.; but he thinks that pressure, in the form of a complete cutting off of the coal supply and restrictions on the importation of Spanish fruit and wine, may prove an effective argument. In order to secure this pressure, His Majesty&apos;s Government have requested, through Sir C. Spring Rice and Mr. BalfouFs Mission, that the, linked States Government should . co-operate with a view to inducing a more satisfactory attitude in the Spanish Government. The State Department have been requested to instruct the United States Ambassador at Madrid to associate himself with Sir A. Hardinge in intimating to the Spanish Government that, since ample provision has been made for the export of British coal to Spain under the Cortina agreement, the United States do not see their way to allowing any export from America. In compliance with Mr. BalfouUs representations, Mr. Lansing has undertaken to put pressure on the Spanish Ambassador at Washington ; but definite measures by the United States Government in the direction desired must await the passing of the Export Restriction Bill by Congress.CHINA.The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed gratification on being informed of the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to meet China&apos;s reasonable demands in a generous spirit whenever she definitely joins the Allies. A message from the Japanese Government in the same sense was communicated to the Chinese Govern-ment on 2nd May; the French and Russian Ministers at Peking agreed to take similar action. Nevertheless, the President remains unconvinced and evasive; to the Japanese Minister he went so far as to express the hope that Parliament would see fit to leave the situation undisturbed. It would appear that an unfavourable Anew of the Allies&apos; prospects has been produced by an alarmist report of the situation in Russia, forwarded by the Chinese Minister at Petrograd.Further pressure by His Majesty&apos;s representative to expedite Chums declaration of war has been tem.porari.l_y suspended, and he has been instructed to mark time (4th May) with a view to enabling the United States Government to conclude the purchase (now under negotiation) of certain destroyers from a South American State, of which the sale will be nominally to China. This has necessitated the maintenance of China&apos;s neutrality until the bargain is either concluded or abandoned, and precluded His M.ajesty&apos;s Government for the moment from pursuing the line of action in which the Japanese Government had been invited, and had agreed, to co-operate. As any prolonged delay might create misunderstandings and difficulties for His Majesty&apos;s Government vis-a-vis the Japanese, Sir 0. Spring Rice was instructed v6th May) to express the hope that the ship-purchasing negotiations may be expedited as much as possible ; latest advices from Washington appear to indicate that the South American deal is not likely to he concluded in the immediate future and that the United States Minister at Peking wull therefore be instructed not to keep back China any longer from declaring war.The political situation at Peking, as described by Mr. Alston on 8th May, continues undecided. The Premier, with the Progressives and the military party, are cleter-mined to carry through their war policy, which has been adopted by the Cabinet, but they are opposed by the President and the Radicals of the Kuo lnin Tang. The result of the vote to be taken in. Parliament is essentially a matter of party politics and therefore ttneertain. If Parliament declines to endorse the CabinePs decision, either Parliament or the Cabinet must go. The British and Japanese Legations are agreed in continuing to give their moral support to Premier Tuan.JAPAN.,Tire Japanese Government have sent a military mission under General Tannaka to China. Their itinerary, according to Press reports, will cover South Manchuria, Ciiihli, Shantung and the lower Yangtsze. Upon enquiring whether this mission had any special object, connected with official or unofficial military activities in China, Sir C. Greene was informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that-it was intended to be a voyage deludes, the Japanese Government having received no military reports on local conditions for some time. General Tannaka&apos;s visit would, if anything,&apos; tend to restrain undesirable military activities.
:i3In this connection, it is of interest to note that in a conversation with Mr. Balfour on Cth May, Mr. Lansing stated that the Japanese Government had asked the United States Government to recognise their succession to German rights in Shantung. The claim was admitted in principle hut limited in its application to such German rights as had keen recognised by the United. States. The State Departments policy, for reasons which he explained, is to acquiesce in Japanese expansion in Manchuria but not in the south, of China.The Japanese Government have been informed. (9th May) that His Majesty&apos;s Government are withdrawing the Statutory List for Japan on 11th May.BRAZIL.Senhor Lau.ro Mtiller, Minister for Foreign Affairs, resigned on 2nd May. On the following day the President offered the post to Senhor Nilo Pecanha, adding that unless he could, rely upon his assistance in the present-serious condition of affairs, he had made up his mind to resign. Not only on account of the international, situation, but because of the difficulties with the Argentine, he needed a strong man. to help him. Senhor Pecanha accepted office, but on the understanding that Brazil must join the United States in declaring war against Germany. It is therefore expected that the president will address Congress in this sense.On 3rd May instructions were issued by the Brazilian Government to detain the German Minister at the frontier of Uruguay, pending receipt of news that the Brazilian representative in Berlin has been allowed to depart. They feared that, as in the case of the Cuban Minister, it might be the intention of the German Government to detain him, until, the German Minister reached Germany. On the Sth of May, however, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Montevideo reported that His Excellency had arrived, there and that his future movements were uncertain.CHILE.The Chilian Government deny that any funds belonging to German bank agencies have ever been transmitted to Germany through the Chilian. Legation in Holland or other official channels (vide Report No. .13). They also state that all Chilian Legations and Consulates in Europe were instructed last December to abstain from forwarding private correspondence. Sir F. Stronge is convinced that these assurances are trustworthy, and attributes the irregularities complained of to slackness on the part of subordinate officials.VENEZUELA.His Majesty&apos;s representative at Caracas reports that the United States Government are endeavouring by pressure to induce Venezuela to break with Germany, but public opinion would, he thinks, be generally opposed to a rupture. Having learned that the Presidential Message to Congress would only contain a general expression of goodwill and a declaration of neutrality, the American Minister decided to abstain from attending the ceremony to which the Diplomatic Body was invited and at his request the British, French and Italian representatives adopted the same course. &apos; Mr. Beau-mont considers that the adoption of the statutory list policy by the Allies would inflict as much damage on. German influence as this pressure to force Venezuela to abandon her neutrality. The Presidential message leaves the door open for rupture with Germany should Venezuelan interests be directly affected.URUGUAY.The Cabinet has discussed the question of breaking off relations with Germany, but is apparently deterred from so doing by reason of the alarming statements made by responsible men in England and the United States concerning the effect of the submarine campaign.25W2--2 rj
GUATEMALA.According to information supplied to Mr. Balfour by the Secretary of State at Washington, Guatemala is prepared to declare war against Germany, but the State Department prefer to temporise and to use Guatemakds readiness for Avar as a check on Carranza.The German Minister, who on 27th April was given eight days to leave Guatemala, proposed to go to Costa Idea but was informed that the Costa Rican Government declined to receive him.CUBA.The insurrection is developing seriously in Oriente province and complete anarchy reigns in many districts. The rebels, who are all negroes, openly declare that if the President remains in office after the expiry of his term on 20th May, they will take and loot Santiago and commence a general destruction of property. The general sentiment of the people in Oriente province is extremely anti-American. Mr. Leech has suggested to the United States Minister the advisability of having a warship sent, to Santiago.ii.\ VT1.The Republics intention to declare war on Germany was announced on the IGth April (vide Report No. 12). Political dissensions and German, propaganda have since jrjreyented the Government from coming to a final decision in the matter. On the 4th May, the Minister for Foreign Affairs enquired whether in the event of HaylPs joining the Allies, the Bfitish and French Governments would give an assurance that she would be admitted to participation in the Peace negotiations. Plis Majesty&apos;s Government considers that no such assurance should, be given at present.UNITED STATES.Referring to the passage by Congress of the Bill permitting the enlistment of British subjects, Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the military authorities have suggested to Mr. Balfour that His Majesty&apos;s Government should consider the adoption of some form of compulsory military service for British subjects ordinarily resident in the United States and conclude any agreement which the United States Govern-ment might require to make it effective, on lines similar to that made with the Russian Government.On -.1 th May Mr. Balfour received a deputation of Irish Americans of high standing, who desired to emphasise the importance of promoting complete unity in the United States by a settlement of the Irish. question. The proceedings were confidential. Mr. Balfour pointed out that he had no authority to express the views of Plis Majesty&apos;s Government on this question. The deputation was generally disposed to favour Sir Horace Plunkets solution and opposed, to any scheme involving partition.Idle American Post Office authorities are reluctant to establish a Postal Censorship and would prefer to make routing arrangements, by which United States mails for Europe would come within the censorship of the Allies.A Bill has been laid before Congress by the United States War Department for deepeniug Portland harbour to allow vessels to lie alongside the Grand Trunk wharves at all tides. This is intended as a war measure and to be conditional, on the Canadian Government undertaking to make use of the port at all times during the continuance of the war and not only when the St. Lawrence is closed.Following upon a conference between the British Mission and the,United States shipping authorities, the Chairman of the Shipping Board has raised the question whether American steel should be supplied to Japan unless the assurance were given.
THE  SHIPPING- SITUATION.The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs has pointed out to Sir E. Howard that, as the result of the action of the Swedish Government in inducing shipowners to resume trade with Great Britain, 12 Swedish vessels have sailed for the United. Kingdom since 1st April. In view of this proof of their desire to help the resumption of Anglo-Swedish traffic, and of the settlement of the Kogrunds passage question, the Swedish Government are anxious to know whether the British Government are prepared to fulfil their promise to release a corresponding number of Swedish ships and to facilitate the examination of calling ships at Halifax.Negotiations for the acquisition of Norwegian shipping are still proceeding. In this connection, the Foreign Office has directed Sir M. Findlay to suggest to the Norwegian Government the expediency in their own interests of coming to a friendly agreement with Great Britain on the lines now proposed, inasmuch as the influence of the United States Government, who have promised to co-operate in bringing pressure to bear on neutrals,will hereafter tend, to restrict, British, and to define Norwegian, liabilities. The Shipowners&apos; Association of Christiania have supplied Sir M. Findlay with, figures showing the tonnage of -Norwegian ships employed in home waters and overseas ; from this it appears that 410,578 tons are employed on time charters in. distant waters and 2.14,6.13 tons in trading from Norway overseas. His Majesty&apos;s Minister is of opinion that any acquisition of vessels by His Majesty&apos;s Government must come chiefly from these two classes of shipping, but he fears that, allowing for losses, there will not be much margin from which to maintain the amount of tonnage reserved for Norway.His Majesty&apos;s Government are at present giving detailed consideration to the statistical position of Danish, Swedish, Dutch and Spanish tonnage, and at the same time to the diplomatic considerations which, must determine the methods to be enqfloyed in securing for the Allies such a proportion of that tonnage as these countries do not require for their essential imports. The solution of this question, depends necessarily and chiefly upon the rate at which shipping is destroyed. According to figures supplied by the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir R. Paget, Great Britain has requisitioned 27 Danish steamers since 1st February; during the same period the Germans have sunk 19 Danish steamers and 13 sailing vessels.- Under these circumstances, the Danish Government are preparing a memorandum setting forth their arguments against further requisitioning, and His Majesty&apos;s&apos;C!overnment have decided to await the result of negotiations now proceeding at Copenhagen, and further information concerning the number of Danish ships laid up, before requisitioning anymore. An official estimate of Denmark&apos;s irreducible minimum of essential imports shows a total of 3,650,000 tons as against 7,300,000 tons in 1913. Sir R. Paget gathers from tlie Minister for Foreign Affairs that the German Government may consent to concede immunity from submarine attack to Danish ships bringing coal and other commodities to Denmark, in return for which they would probably require an increased export of horses.Sir W. Townley reports that a bad impression is being created in Holland by the detention at Plalifax of certain vessels which were duly authorised by His Majesty&apos;s2962-2 ]i]that all. ships built with that steel in Japan will be available for the essential services of the Allies. With reference to a similar enquiry on the subject of shipbuilding in Canada, Hongkong and Shanghai, the British Mission, recommends that the . American Shipping Board should be definitely informed that existing British ship-building contracts have been made solely with the view to meeting immediate war needs. The United States Government fully recognise the gravity of the situation and intend to do everything possible by legislation and organisation to stimulate shipbuilding (vide also under The Shipping Situation).Sir C. Spring Bice has been instructed to suggest to the State Department that the employment of American shipping to carry coal to Europe is uneconomic and that all tonnage available should be used rather for conveyance of materials which cannot be supplied to the Allies from the United Kingdom. It is also suggested that the United States Government should prohibit the export of sugar to any but Allied countries. Sir C. Spring Rice reports (8th May) that the plans of the United States Government for the restriction of exports are reaching an advanced stage.
Government to. proceed in ballast on a round journey to; bring, grain; for the Ketberlands government. ,   ..!; .. --. .   ,;/,   -;&apos;:The : Dutch Trawlers Association , have -decided to lay up their boats-until&apos;: the Germans give a- guarantee that no more will be torpedoed.Two Spanish trawlers, fishing close to some French boats, were sunk by a German submarine off San Sebastian on 4th May.Members of the British Mission in the United States have perceived indications, both at. the State Department and the Navy Department, of suspicion directed towards Japan&apos;s attitude in the matter of shipping.. The Chairman of the Shipping Board has addressed a definite enquiry to the Mission on this subject, desiring to be informed -whether Japan has been asked to allot merchant tonnage to Allied services in danger zones, and if so, with what results ? The Shipping Board is preparing for a drastic diversion of United States tonnage for war purposes, but when asking Congress for the necessary powers, desires to be furnished with facts and figures to meet inevitable criticism. The Board has also enquired whether Great Britain and her Allies have made sacrifices of trade interests equal to those which, the United States are preparing to incur ? To what extent, for example, have vessels in Australia and other Dominions been requisitioned ? Pending the compilation of a detailed reply to these enquiries, Sir 0. Spring Bice has been instructed to observe that the nature and extent of the restrictions which have been imposed on British shipping are best illustrated by the fact that whereas recent sales have shown the value of a 4,800-ton steamer under the British flag to be 84,0007.., a similar vessel under the French flag has been sold for 180,0007.., and an American for 240,0007. As regards Japanese shipping, His Majesty&apos;s Governments applications for assistance of the kind referred to have, so far, met with no success.For the period 27th April 3rd May, the reported losses of merchant steamers over 500 tons due to enemy activity were : British - 138,263 tons gross.Neutral and Allied     - 53,431        ,,Total     - - -   191,694The total tonnage of sailing vessels destroyed was 24,889 tons.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.Sir C. Spring Rice was informed by the State Department on 4th May that three American Socialists were sailing on the following day to attend the Stockholm Conference. The Secretary of State only agreed to give them, permission to sail because they stated that Mr. Henderson was being allowed to go from England and that two Belgian Ministers would attend. It was understood that they might be required to return from Halifax. Under these circumstances Sir C. Spring Rice, requested to be informed as to the facts concerning British and Belgian delegates and the real object of the Conference. The Foreign. Office replied that no official repre-sentatives from Great Britain, France, or Belgium would attend and that His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it most undesirable that delegates front the United States should go to Stockholm, since the Conference is in no way fitted to attain its avowed object, namely, to hasten the conclusion of peace. Austria is represented at the Conference by four delegates, Bulgaria by two, and Germany by nine, exclusive of three Independent Socialists.   The French minority party are also sending delegates.GENERAL.The Dutch Government have been requested to press the Turkish Government for a reply to the proposal put before them on behalf of Great Britain by the United States Ambassador at the end. of March for the mutual exchange of 600 invalid prisoners of war.From escaped British prisoners it has been ascertained that in January there were between 300 and 400 British prisoners of war working at Cambrai who had
never been sent to Germany and whose names have never been reported to&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Netherlands Minister at Berlin has been requested to obtain as soon as possible a list of all British combatant prisoners in. the occupied territories in Trance and Belgium..According to information supplied by Captain T. Morgan and Lieutenant Douglas Stewart, recently escaped from Germany, the Commandant at Ingolstadt prison received orders from headquarters aboufr the end of March prohibiting the -delivery of parcels to British prisoners of war. Numerous complaints on the subject shave been received from other quarters. From Crefeld and Furstenberg camps it nas been reported that no food parcels were received by prisoners during February. The German Governments recent denial (vide last Report) is therefore unacceptable and the Netherlands Minister at Berlin has been requested to reinvestigate the matter with all possible urgency. There are also constant complaints with regard to the stoppage of prisoners&apos; correspondence at Ruhleben camp.A first detachment of some 600 doctors, male nurses and. enlisted men are leaving New York for England in two parties on 7th May and 11th.
