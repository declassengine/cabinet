SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 0.Imperial Conference.The failure, at the last moment, of Mr. Hughes&apos;,s effort to arrange the Australian &apos; Parliamentary situation so as to enable him to come over to attend the Imperial. War Conference, is most, unfortunate, it is one of the most serious limitations to the efficiency of the present system of conferences between Governments based on the party system, that imperial consultation, however important, is liable to be held up at any moment by some local political crisis.France.The negotiations between the President &quot;of the Hoard of Trade and M. Clementel with regard to the restrictions on imports from Prance show that the French are meeting the situation created by our restrictions in a very reasonable spirit.G I! RE.CE.The diplomatic situation is still chaotic. But there seems to be a growing realization, among the Allies that it is time that they had a common policy in. Greece and knew what that policy was.The internal situation is no clearer. The idea of a change of Government is still in the air, and both M. Kalogeropouios and M. Strains, neither of them very satis-factory candidates from our point of view, arc spoken of as possible successors to Professor Lambros. In Volo and elsewhere there seems to fx: a revival, of the Venizelist movement, but it is not clear to what extent this is spontaneous or only reflects the activity of French agents.Meanwhile arrangements for preventing the starvation of (1 recce, \ enizelist as well, as Royalist, are not making as much progress as could be wished, and the danger of famine is still present.G krai an So dma It I \: e C a.m 1&apos;aiun.The German hope that the submarine campaign, could he used to create difficulties between ourselves and neutrals is to some extent being justified. While Norway is coming fairly satisfactorily into line with our measures as regards shipping, Sweden, Denmark and Holland are all, under heavy German pressure, following a course of policy which may lead to serious differences of opinion with tin; British Government. The attitude of the Swedes in refusing to let the British ships in. the Baltic get out through the Kogrund passage, and the Dutch refusal to allow a British ship, defensively armed, to enter a Dutch, port, are typical instances.The simultaneous ventilation in Berlin and at the Vatican of the idea of a mutual cessation of &quot;warfare by starvation &quot; is interesting, it would be slid more interesting to know whether there was any connection between the two movements. That the idea should have been first mooted by one of the smaller neutrals is very natural. Their position between the upper and nether millstones of the submarine campaign, and our regulations is anything but pleasant.
China.It may safely be assumed, that each of the parties contending for power at Peking-will promise almost anything that Japan may ask, in. the hope of securing for itself the large financial benefits offered by the Allies, and by the repudiation of China&apos;s obligations to Germany, ft is certain that the monarchist party in China (in. other words, the Conservative opponents of the Cantonese Radicals) has many and. powerful adherents, especially among the Military Governors, who would not hesitate to promise Japan liberal terms in regard to Shantung, Manchuria, &amp;c, in return for financial largesse and the suppression of Young China. But it is difficult to see by what arguments Japan could justify to the world her support of a monarchical regime in China, in view of the &apos;assistance which she has rendered for years to the Young China revolutionaries, and of her action in forbidding President Yuan Shih-k&apos;ai. to ascend the Throne. The Japanese Foreign Ministers declaration in favour of the maintenance of the Republic, but with a more efficient constitution, suggests an attempt to work with the Conservatives without directly going back upon Japaifs past policy7.HI L.

part I   BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.The Governor-General of Australia has informed the Secretary of State tbat the Commonwealth Delegates are not proceeding to the War Conference on account of the dissolution of -Parliament. Press telegrams report that it has been suggested in Parliament that Mr. Andrew Fisher (High Commissioner of the Commonwealth) and Sir George Reid should be asked to represent the Commonwealth at the Conference, but Mr. Joseph Cook (Minister for the Nary) replied that no public servant, however highly placed, could adequately represent Australia at the Conference.CANADA.The Shipping Controller lias informed the Dominion Government that he is ready to purchase suitable steamers which are now being built in Canadian shipyards. Should there be none suitable, the Controller suggests that in any event ships should only be built for Allies.On the understanding that the construction of seaplanes will not interfere with more urgent work, the Admiralty have approved of the suggestion made by the Dominion Government and. are sending officers to advise. It is pointed out, however, that the whole machines must be made in. Canada or the United. States.AUSTRALIA.The Governor-General telegraphs that he has agreed to the immediate dissolution of Parliament, and that the elections for the third Senate, which, in any event, would, have been necessary in May, will probably be held at the same time as the elections for the Lower House.From Press telegrams it appears that Mr. TudoFs motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission to enquire into the charges of corruption against the Government was defeated in the House of Representatives by 35 votes to 18.The Commonwealth Government has notified the Secretary of State for the Colonies of the appointment of a Shipping Board, representative of owners and others, with power to control matters of tonnage and freight within Australian waters. It is suggested that this Board should be put in direct communication with the proper authority in control of shipping in the United Kingdom. Meantime, enquiries are made as to cargoes, rates, &amp;c.The Secretary of State has informed the Government that imports of jam are not prohibited, and that about 50 per cent, of imports of dried, preserved and pulped fruit will probably be licensed. The matter of the importation of apples is now being considered.The Australian Government have intimated that they will be entirely guided by the Home authorities as to the amount and. character of products for exportation, but point out that the total prohibition of leather is serious. Though the quantity exported from Australia is not great, it involves much outlay, and the Government would like a proportion which meets British requirements to be taken.The Commonwealth has concurred in the appointment of His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught as Inspector-General of the overseas troops training in England.The Government point out the bad effect upon Australian recruiting of the number of Italians of military age who are still in Australia. The Commonwealth authorities suggest that the matter of their non-recall should be put before the Italian Government.The Secretary of State has telegraphed that he agrees to the proposed sales of wheat to South Africa and other Dominions. He has also agreed to the sales to neutrals on f.o.b. basis.
The Government reports that the following figures show the troops despatched -during the month of January :- -New units ReinforcementsOfficers27 1.12Men.4884,51(5The number in training on 31st January amounted, to 301 officers and 16,838 others.The Secretary of State has expressed the gratitude of the Army Council to the Commonwealth Government for their readiness to agree to the suggestion, regarding ,a Sixth Division.   Tire nucleus of this is now being formed.NEW ZEALAND.The,gratitude of the Army Council has been conveyed to the Government for their prompt response to the request regarding further units. An additional infantry brigade is, now being formed, and an assurance has been, given to the Dominion Government that reinforcements coming from New Zealand will be used in. the first instance to maintain the existing New Zealand Division.NEWFOUNDLAND.The Governor has telegraphed for the information of the Army Council that the Colouv has sent 3,800 troops oversea. The number enrolled in. the Naval. Reserve is 1,600.JAMAICA.The Governor announces that a proposal for conscription was introduced into the Legislative Council last year by an elected member, but that he did not then accept it as voluntary effort had been sufficient. It is to be proposed again in the present Session and, if supported, by elected members and passed, will be accepted as an enabling measure. Owing to delays in the despatch of contingents, it has been necessary to check recruiting. The staff is not sufficient to deal with the numbers, and. accommodation, has been difficult to find. However, if transports arrive regularly the question of whether the voluntary system, will prove adequate can be decided.   There are about 2.000 men now ready to embark.HAS! TO LAND.The Paramount Chief: (Griffith Lerothodi) has sent the sum of 40,oOOZ. to His Majesty King George as a gift from the Basuto nation for the purposes of the war. In. doing this he has expressed to His Majesty the loyalty of the Basuto and their hope of a speedy and complete victory. The High Commissioner points out that the money has been collected, quite voluntarily and suggests that the sum should be applied to a definite military object. The Basuto previously presented 2,800Z. to the Prince of Wales&apos;s Fund.With regard to the new Basuto contingent, the High Commissioner for South Africa has asked, for the return, of an officer from France to organise and take charge of units, lie suggests that it would encourage recruiting if it could, be announced that Sir Herbert Sloiey (ex-Resident Commissioner of Basutoland), who is now in England, could visit the contingent in France and report as to its welfare.NY ASA LAND.The Governor has telegraphed that it is most important to obtain free entry of Nyasaland produce and asking for the conditions attaching to the licences in respect of tea, coffee, &amp;c.
;:       ; ,        . EAST   AFRICA. &apos;        &apos;The Pretender to the Zanzibar Sultanate (with his two sons) has been captured in (German East Africa, and, owing to his strong pro-German, attitude, the Secretary of State has suggested to the Governor of St. Helena that he should be interned in that Colony.part  ii.-foreign affairs.FRANCE.The President of the Board of Trade and staff proceeded to Paris on the 4th instant, at the invitation of the French Government (vide last. week&apos;s summary), to negotiate with M. Cleraentel, Minister for Commerce, in regard to the new restrictions on imports into Gi-eat Britain.On the 6th, he reported that discussions were proceeding amicably on the basis of reciprocal exclusions, and that a settlement on these lines should effect a considerable saving of tonnage, beyond that contemplated by the Committee.BELGIUM.In reply to the representations addressed by the Netherlands to the German Government concerning safe-conducts for the Belgian Relief Commission ships held up in British ports, Sir W. Townley was informed on the 1st of March that the German.Government were prepared in principle to guarantee free passage to these vessels to Rotterdam, but required first to be informed of their names and ports of detention. Their demand for this information was based on the ground that a general safe-conduct might be made to serve as protection for British vessels using the Relief Commission^ distinctive marks. It was refused on the ground that to .thve it (especially after the sinking of the Dutch liners) would expose the relief ships to risk of treacherous attack. Further efforts are being made to induce the German Government to abandon this demand, but as it is evident that in any case there must be further delays, and as it is extremely important that the Commission^ tonnage should be freed at; once in order to proceed to America for fresh supplies, orders have been given (1st March) for the discharge of the cargoes of the vessels in. question. The Commission have been authorised to store these cargoes, pending an explicit arrangement by Germany in the matter of safe-conducts ; should this be-indefinitely delayed, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be compelled to purchase the foodstuffs for domestic consumption.Mr. Hoover, on further consideration, has intimated the willingness of the American delegates to remain in charge of the Rotterdam and London offices of the Relief Commission, a decision cordially approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government;. Sir 0. Spring Rice has been instructed to request that, if this course is adopted by the United, States Government, the Foreign Office may be placed, in a position to com-municate the fact to the Dutch, and Spanish Governments as soon as possible. As regards the financial position of the Commission, His Majesty&apos;s Government arc of opinion, that even allowing for increased subsidies by Great Britain, it will be necessary that at least 500,0001. a month, should be provided in the United States.FRANCE AND ITALY.Referring to the question of coal shortage in Italy (vide Summaries Nos. 2 and 4), the French Government have replied (3rd March) that they cannot supply Italy&apos;s-requirements, and express the opinion that the Italian Government are in a position to meet them partially out of their own existing resources. They point out that their reserves of coal were considerably larger than the French at the beginning of the year ; also that the Italian tonnage is not being fully utilised for the purposes of the Allies. Evidence of this last statement is deduced from the recent formation of a new Italian company to provide a shipping service between Brazil and the United States.
ITALY.Concerning the Swiss Governments claim, to ownership in certain consignments of oil-cake requisitioned by the Italian Government, the latter have requested Sir R. Rodd to explain that their action in the matter is prompted not by illwill, but by stern necessity-. The insufficiency of fodder in Italy has already necessitated the killing of cattle ; they are, therefore, unable to release the supplies in question. At the same time, they hope, as the result of negotiations 2iow proceeding, to be able to persuade the Swiss Government to withdraw their claims and to free this fodder for the Italian market.GREECE.The lack of op-ordination and continuity in the policies of the Allies in Greece continues to be manifested in several directions. While the essential differences between the French and Italian policies, supporting the Venizelist and Royalist parties respectively, are something more than local in. their origins, there is increasing confirmation of the view that much of the existing friction at Athens and Salonika is due to personalities rather than to policies. Recognition of this fact, no doubt, inspired the memorandum communicated to the Foreign Office by the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires (2nd March), in which it is suggested that the Allied Ministers at Athens should be instructed to &quot;refrain for the present from making separate representations to the Greek Government; that any necessary communications should take the form of identical Notes in the name of the Entente Powers ; and that, in the event of disagreement, the vote of the majority should prevail, with reference in case of need to the Conference of Ambassadors in Rome. Sir F. Elliot deprecates the suggestion that he should be bound by the vote of a majority of Iris colleagues.On the 2nd March, the French Ambassador at Petrograd informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that at the recent Calais Conference, the British Prime Minister had concurred in the advisability of replacing all the Allied Ministers at Athens. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated in reply that Russia would offer no objections to this course ; at the same time, he considered the first essential requisite to be that the Ministers, whoever they might be, should come to such an agreement concerning the facts of the situation in Greece as to enable &quot;the Allied Governments to base thereon a continuous and consistent policy.As matters stand, there are differences of opinion, and consequent delays in regard to several matters. Sir F. Elliot would like to return to Athens, and. proposes to do so ; hut would like first to be assured, that we shall not be embroiled, with Greece by the action of General Sarrail. He has failed to obtain from his French colleague any indication of the French Governments policy. The Mixed Commission on Indemnities has not yet been constituted, because of the French Governments disagreement with Sir F. Elliots proposal concerning the appointment of a second Greek delegate and. a neutral umpire. The arrangements for the provision and distribution of supplies through the Allied Board at Athens continue to be criticised by the French on the one hand and by the Venizelists on the other, Lord Granville insisting that &quot;Innocent Venizelist Greece &quot; should he saved, from famine before the guilty Royalists. An instance of agreement and united action, on the other hand, has been recorded in regard to the scheme of controls, allotted as follows : Posts and telegraphs to France, police to Italy, railways and roads to Russia, posts to England ; the head of each control being a member of the Joint Board and presiding in turn.In last weelts summary the attitude and. actions of the Greek authorities were described as encouraging, and Sir F. Elliots hope was recorded that it might be found possible to raise the blockade before the 5th of March. Telegraphing on the 2nd, however, he described the Government as quite unrepentant and unreformed, and expressed the opinion that the only remedy lies in a change of government, and eventhatcanonlvbeapalliativeunt.il all power has been taken from the General Staff.Lord Granville and Sir F. Elliot concur in describing the poorer population, generally, and the Venizelists in particular, as suffering serious distress, especially in the coast districts of Epirus. The Provisional Government is helpless and implores the Allies to render assistance.In this connection it is important to note that on the 6th instant Sir F. Elliot was directed to draw attention to the recent sinking by a German submarine of a grain ship under requisition to the Greek Government, and. to point out that Great Britain2592-1 B
cannot accept responsibility for the shortage of food in Greece if the Greek Govern-ment cannot protect itself against these piratical attacks.   ....M. Venizelos hopes shortly to be able to bring his Cretan Division to Salonika, and has asked that it may be placed under General Milne&apos;s orders on the British front, to which proposal General Sarrail has consented, after some demur. General Milne has no personal objection, but awaits the decision of General Sarrail or the Allied Govern-ments, only stipulating that if the matter is arranged, these troops must bo entirely under his administration as regards commissariat, hospital treatment, Ac. Sir Armand Ruffer (in charge of the organisation of the Greek Red Cross) expresses serious anxiety about the prospects of the Venizelist army from a sanitary point of view.The Royalist authorities having declined to return to Cerigo, and the Vcnizelists having been withdrawn, the control officer reports that the island remains without local authority. Under these circumstances, Sir F. Elliot supports the solution suggested by M. Venizelos, namely, that the island should be administered for the present by the Allied authorities on behalf of the Greek Government.General Can bone has complained of the existence of armed bands along the neutral zone and in the districts of Grevcna, Metsvo, and Konitza. Instructions have been issued by the Minister of the Interior to the Prefects concerned, ordering them to take severe measures against these bands.The Greek Government have complained of the interruption of telegraphic communication between Athens and their Legation at Rome. Of 32 cypher telegrams despatched by the Greek Minister between the 3rd and the 20th February, none have reached Athens. Sir F. Elliot is of opinion that this interruption is due to the French Admirabs censorship at Zante.GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Uerr Ballin is reported to have delivered himself of the opinion that Germany stands to lose by her submarine warfare, inasmuch as its results are likely to handicap her seriously in shipping competition hereafter. He considers it probable that German ships in neutral ports will be seized and that, as Germany is not in a position, to replace them (owing to lack of copper and other building materials, and shortage of labour), she will be at a great disadvantage for at least two years after the war.SWEDEN.Sir E. Howard reports (3rd March) serious attacks on Great Britain and the British Legation by the pro-German newspapers Aftonhladet and Nya Dagligt Aliehanda, in anticipation of the Governments defeat on the vote for military credits. Sir E. Howard has officially called the attention of: the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the offending articles and requested an inquiry. He asks that in the event of the Editors&apos; failing to prove their statements, they should be required to make a public apology, and if they refuse, that the Swedish Government should declare their allegations to be false.The Ministry, having been defeated on the 3rd, resigned on tire 5th instant, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks it probable that, as the result of negotiations instituted at the request of His Majesty the King, its resignation will not be carried into effect. Sir E Howard considers that the Prime Ministers action in resigning is primarily intended to prove to the Opposition the weakness of their own position and that a compromise will result, which will include acceptance by the Prime Minister of the agreement with England.DENMARK.The Minister for Foreign Affairs has vetoed a proposal made by the Agricultural Delegates, namely, that the shortage in the quantity of bacon due to be supplied. to-Great Britain in December and January should be made good by allowing none to Germany during the current month. He states that the pressure brought to bear by the Germans with regard to the recent reduction of exports to them lias become seriously threatening, and that he dares not oppose them in their present temper.(Note.  Further information concern nig shipping affairs in the Scandinavian Gauntries will he found under the heading of &quot; German Submarine Campaign.&quot;)
The Spanish Government have authorised the transfer to the French Admiralty, of six small steamers, sold by a Vigo firm, to be used as patrol boats and mine sweepers.Sir A. Uardiuge forwards a report (6th March) that the Hamburg-American Line have resumed negotiations, begun before the war, for the purchase of a shipbuilding yard at Cadiz, and that the. deaj is likely to be concluded in a few days.PORTUGAL,With, a view to meeting the wishes of the Portuguese authorities, the Admiralty have now proposed a re-arrangement of the; programme for the transport of the troops from Lisbon, to Brest, which, has been accepted.Having reference to the Portuguese Governments urgent and reiterated requests for assistance in purchasing wheat, Sir L. Carnegie was instructed (3rd March) to point out that tonnage had been provided for conveying a supply of grain, to Portugal, and that three shiploads had already been sent to Lisbon without, awaiting the conclusion of the necessary financial arrangements. His Majesty&apos;s Government were, however, unable to account for the fact that, although Lisbon was reported, to be on the verge of famine, and although the Portuguese Government had funds at their disposal in London (accruing in respect of ex-German vessels seized), this matter of payment for the wheat was still unarranged. Replying to enquiries on the subject, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has explained that, by a decision of Congress, the monies in question cannot bo removed from the Caisse Des Depots till the end of the war. The matter is still under discussion, but in the meanwhile orders have been given for the loading of a fourth ship in New York, and it is hoped that the Portuguese Government will forthwith sanction the transfer of funds sufficient to pay for the four cargoes in-question. As regards Portugal^ request in. this connection, for a new loan of 2,000,000/., Sir L. Carnegie was instructed (5th March) to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government have finally decided against making this advance, the refusal being doe to the great and increasing difficulties of effecting payments in America.In a recent despatch (No. 15), Sir L. Carnegie draws attention to the increasing unpopularity of Great Britain in Portugal, due to the fact that to England falls the duty of asking the Portuguese Government to take measures, in the common Allied interest, entailing inconvenience and sacrifices, lie thinks that more might be done to flatter their national pride (without losing their respect by any lack of firmness), and to this end suggests that more attention should be devoted in the British Press to Portuguese affairs. He mentions that the Morning Post and Daily Mail correspondents at Lisbon are pronounced monarchists, while the Times is practically unrepresented.CHINA.The latest reports received from. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking all point to the conclusion that the question of China&apos;s making common cause with the Allies against; Germany has become a matter of internal politics and therefore extremely coinpli-cated. The fact that Japan has exercised strong pressure on the Chinese Government to break with Germany, and urged the British, French, and Russian Governments to give similar advice, constitutes a factor in the situation which (combined with the financial inducements offered) was evidently bound to lead to serious dissensions amongst the political factions at Peking. From a private and unofficial Japanese source, Sir C. Greene was informed on the 7th February that the so-called reactionary party in China is plotting to re-establish the Alanchu. dynasty and that its scheme is tacitly approved, by the Japanese Government. Commenting on this information in a telegraphic despatch (1st March), Mr. Alston considers it possible that the Japanese Government, reversing its former policy, may have come to some arrangement with the monarchists. This, however, would necessarily imply a definite breach with the Young China party, unless means can be found to conciliate the President, Liang Ch&apos;i-Ch&apos;ao, and other leaders of that party.Sir 0. Greene, telegraphing from Tokio on the 5th. instant, reports that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed himself as opposed to interference in the internal affairs of China, and considers the maintenance of the Republic, with an2592-3 0
energetic President and a more efficient Parliament, to be preferable to a restoration, of monarchy. Pie criticised, the weakness of the present regime and the defects oI: Ckina&apos;s so-called Constitution.These views have been corroborated by the course of events during the past week. The Vice-president and the Premier expressed, themselves in favour of an immediate breach with Germany, but the President (identified hitherto with the Young China party) maintained.a hesitating attitude under the influence of German, threats or persuasions, and finally (4th March) declined to sign telegrams to the Military Governors announcing the Cabinets decision to sever relations with Germany. The Premier thereupon departed for Tientsin. On the following clay the President offered, to despatch the telegrams, with a view to inducing the Premier to return ; the latter&apos;s object in leaving was to secure from the President a free hand, which, in view oP the financial inducements and other support promised by the Allies, he seems likely to get. On the 5th, it was announced that the President had fallen into line, but that a period of diplomatic rupture will in any case precede the declaration of war ; this is evidently intended to afford time for settlement of the financial and other issues involved.    The Premier returned to Peking on the Gth.The Allied Ministers at Peking are in favour of absolute expulsion of all. Germans from China, but the Chinese appear to favour internment. In order to lead the Chinese Government to a declaration of war involving the expulsion of Germans, His Majesty&apos;s Government have requested the Japanese Government to join forthwith in making certain firm and definite offers to China, including post-&apos; ponement of the Indemnity payments until after the war, revision of the Customs tariff to an effective 5 per cent., and a guarantee of security against retaliation by Germany. At the same time it is proposed that the Allied Governments should jointly inform China that her other claims will, receive sympathetic consideration so soon as she is at war with Germany. His Majesty&apos;s Government have made a firm offer to China for the purchase of the German ships in Chinese ports, and Japan has offered to lease them.The United States representative at Peking has advised the Chinese Government that in China&apos;s best interests it is inadvisable that she should go further than a severance of diplomatic relations.JAPAN.The terms proposed, by the Japanese Government for the loan of 100 million yen under negotiation by Russia (6 per cent, at 97i-), ai-e considered too onerous by the Russian Government, and likely to prejudice further Allied loans at. Tokio. The matter is therefore in abeyance, and the Russian Government has proposed that negotiations be entered upon for a joint Anglo-French-Russian loan for 200 millions, of which Russia would receive half.The Japanese Government has been informed by Sir C. Greene, in a note dated the 2nd. of March, that the increased duties on cotton will apply equally to goods coming into India from Great Britain and from Japan. The financial and fiscal considerations underlying this measure have been fully explained to the Japanese Government, and readily accepted as necessary and reasonable under the circurn-stances. At the same time, Sir C. Greene lias informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the present arrangements are not to be construed as in any way restricting the future liberty of action of either the British or the Indian Government.ARGENTINA.The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir R. Tower that his Government initiated certain proposals last month, with the object of convening a Conference, of the South American Republics at Buenos Aires, to secure a general exchange of views in regard to the possible restoration of peace and the protection of the Republics&apos; common, interests. Sir R. Tower is of opinion that nothing -will come of Argentina&apos;s attempt to take the lead, in this matter, and His Majesty&apos;s representative at Monte-Video confirms this view in so far as Uruguay is concerned.ECUADOR.Public opinion in Ecuador greatly resents the interference of the United States in the internal, affairs of the Republic as displayed in the State Departments last
&quot;Note on the subject of EcuadoFs financial obligations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has assured His Majesty&apos;s representative that his Government are determined to respect the rights of the bondholders. Mr. Wilson (Quito) has telegraphed his opinion that if a meeting could, be arranged between representatives of the. British bondholders and American bankers it should be possible to arrive at a satisfactory settlement, provided that in the meanwhile no further pressure is exercised by the United States.     . , -.    ;,; ,;  , ..   . MEXICO. \.His Majesty&apos;s representative in Mexico has been instructed to warn tire Mexican -Government that they will be held responsible for any damage to British interests that may result from the activities of German ships at Santa Rosalia (vide last weeks Summary). Mr. Thurstan suggests (4th March) the advisability of post-postponing the despatch, of a Note on the subject pending the result of the American Ambassadors present negotiations with President Oarrauza, which might be seriously embarrassed if the Mexican Government were led to. connect the proposed Note with the recent revelations of Germany;s intrigues in Mexico.CUBA.The Cuban Government  have  blockaded  Santiago  and  two other ports held, by the rebels.    On the 1st of March, there were three United States warships waiting  at Santiago   for   the   protection,   if   necessary, of   foreign   lives   and property.   The rebels at Santiago have compelled, the Royal  Bank  of  Canada  to hand over the Government funds in its possession.UNITED STATES. . ,Sir 0. Spring Rice reports that Sir it. Crawford was informed by the Government of the Federal Reserve Board on the 1st March that the Board proposed to publish a statement intimating the withdrawal of their objections to in vestments by National Ranks in&apos; foreign loans. The object in view is to facilitate hereafter the proposed. Bond-issue for &apos;$ 250,000,000 at present under negotiation, it had been intended to publish this statement on. the 2nd instant, but publication Iras been deferred at the request of Mr. Adoo, pending the decision of Congress on the question, of&apos; arming merchant ships.GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.germany indiscriminate sinking of merchant vessels , continues to impose unprecedented conditions upon, neutral shipping from, Spain to Scandinavia, and&apos; to create many new difficulties for the British Government. Nevertheless, in overcoming these conditions, and inducing neutral countries to continue trading with British and Allied ports, a considerable measure of success has been achieved, more particularly in the case of Norway. On the 3rd instant Sir M. Findlay was able to report that 37 Norwegian ships bad sailed for British ports, and that owners were much encouraged by the fact that no mishaps were reported to any of them. On the following day he telegraphed that business was becoming normal, and suggested that the Danish, shipowners should therefore be pressed to follow Norway&apos;s example. Thirty vessels with coal for Norway had been released from British ports up to the 5th instant. His Majesty&apos;s Minister had also been able to induce the Shipowners&apos; Association to cancel most of their orders for American coal and charters for ships to bring it.The position as regards Denmark is much less satisfactory. On the. 6th March, Sir R. Paget was directed to draw the attention of the Danish Government to the fact that whereas 22 vessels have beeil allowed to proceed to Denmark since 1st February, practically no Danish vessels have reached this country from Denmark during the same period. In other Words, the attitude adopted by Danish shipping interests is calculated to be of direct assistance to Germany, and His Majesty&apos;s representative at Copenhagen has therefore been, instructed to state that unless it is abandoned, the British Government will be compelled to reconsider their whole attitude towards, Danish commercial interests both now and after the war. Certain, abortive proposals have been made by Mr. Andersen for sending vessels in the first&apos; instance in ballast, to get coal from the United Kingdom ; arrangements have been discussed for the requisitioning by the British Government of a number of Danish ships now in British ports, but the general situation continues to be unsatisfactory.
Two Danish, vessels lying in the Thames with, coal for Italy, having refused, to put to sea, have been requisitioned by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The position of affairs as regards Sweden is also unsatisfactory, inasmuch as the; question of the passage of British .ships through the Kogrund Channel is still.-unsolved.   On the 1st instant it was indirectly intimated by His Majesty&apos;s Minister&apos; at Stockholm that,, unless the use of this channel is conceded, His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment may be compelled to requisition an amount of Swedish tonnage corresponding: to that of the British ships now detained in the Baltic.   On the 3rd instant, Sir E. Howard was instructed to state that the privilege of calling at a port outside the United Kingdom would not be accorded to Swedish ships, until traffic with the United Kingdom is resumed and the passage of the Kogrund Channel allowed.   The latter question is still under discussion ; but although His Majesty the King of Sweden is reported to be anxious that some arrangement should be made to permit the British ships to leave the Baltic, the outlook is not very hopeful.   Even Baron Adelsward, who has severely criticised the Swedish Governments action in. this matter, thinks it impossible that the Government should rescind its decision.His Majesty&apos;s Minister at the Hague reports that public opinion in Holland has been greatly irritated by His Majesty&apos;s Governments recent regulations in regard to neutral shipping, and he considers that, if possible, in order to allay this irritation, some arrangement should be devised to exempt Dutch passenger ships from calling at a port in. the United Kingdom. This opinion was telegraphed on the 4th. On. the following day a British steamer, the &quot; Princess Melita,&quot; was ordered to leave the Hook of Holland because she carried a gun, contrary to Dutch regulations. As the ship-was in need of water, the gun was dismounted, but the Captain then refused-to leave without convoy, having been attacked by two submarines on his way to the Hook.In reply to Sir W. Townley&apos;s representations in the matter, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated that the ship may enter and clear again in due course if the gun is removed. His Majesty&apos;s Government assume this statement to imply that the ship will be refused supplies unless she leaves the port unarmed. Sir W. Townley has therefore been directed to inform the Dutch Government and the Netherlands Overseas Trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government will give careful consideration to the situation created by this intolerable condition, and that in the meantime, pending its satisfactory adjustment, no privileges or concessions of any sort will be accorded to any Dutch ships.Twenty-three Dutch vessels were due to sail in. ballast for the United States on the 5th instant. Sir W. Townley telegraphed on the 6th that their departure has been postponed because the German Government is still unable to guarantee complete security by the North-about route. The reason alleged is that certain of their submarines have not yet returned to their bases.Sir A. llardinge, reporting on the Spanish Governments discussion of proposals for the arming and insurance of ships (2nd March), expresses the opinion that Germany may have given some secret undertaking not to sink Spanish ships provided they are not transferred to the British flag. On the 6th instant, he telegraphed that the Government have decided to accept the general principles of an insurance scheme but not to authorise the sale of Spanish ships to Great Britain.Meanwhile neutrals, in their difficult plight, are naturally anxious to find, some way out. In. a recent Berlin wireless (1st March) an &quot;Associated Press &quot; Correspondent is quoted, on the subject of public opinion in Denmark, and of a solution there suggested for the existing impasse, which matter has also-been simultaneously mooted in certain diplomatic quarters. By this proposed solution &quot; Germany would abandon her submarine campaign, while the Allies &quot; would return to the principles of the Declaration of &quot;London., and. recognise &quot; as non-contraband all food, supplies for civilian populations.&quot; The &quot; Associated Press &quot; Correspondent asserts that in &quot; distinguished quarters &quot; in Berlin the proposal is hopefully regarded ; he also describes it as having &quot; emanated &quot; from. Danish shipping circles, the most prominent of which are in touch with the &quot;situation both, in England and Germany to a degree excelled probably by no &quot; other neutral -personages.&quot; A similar policy was suggested by the Vatican in courteous terms on the 28th February and declined with equal courtesy by the British Government, which pointed out that there was no parallel between the British blockade and the German submarine campaign.
