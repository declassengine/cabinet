SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT,  No.  7.Canada.The change in the financial position of Canada from a purely debtor country to one which can raise substantial loans on terms actually better than those of the last Imperial War Loan is not the least interesting development of the war.Windward Islands.The&apos; request from the Windward islands that the Dominions and India might restrict the importation of foreign cocoa, and so, presumably, buy such Windward Islands cocoa as is not allowed to go to the United Kingdom, raises the whole question of the assistance which the different parts of the Empire can furnish both in easing the shipping situation and in relieving other parts of the Empire from the hardships inevitably resulting from the import restrictions.Greece.Son e of the fundamental difficulties in the way,of a definite Allied policy in Greece&quot;&apos;are emphasised in Sir F. Elliots telegram of 9th March. The reconciliation he advocates between the King and M. Venizelos is, no doubt, hopeless, but an eventual reconciliation between Royalist and Venizelist Greece so as to create a strong Greece naturally drawn to England is obviously desirable in British interests. The more Venizelist Greece is helped to become self-dependent in its present territory and strong against the Bulgars, and the less it is encouraged to interfere with Royalist Greece, the better the prospects of such an eventual reunion. The real danger to Greek unity and to Greek relations with, the Allies lies in. the attempt to force Venizelism upon Royalist Greece where it is regarded as an anti-national and unpatriotic mo ve men t.German Submarine Campaign.Except as regards Norway very little progress appears to have been made in inducing neutral shipping to venture into the zone of the submarine blockade, and neither the inducements we offer, nor the economic pressure we apply, have yet sufficiently counteracted German intimidation.L. S. A.15th March 1917.

PART t-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.GENERAL,The Secretary of State has informed the Governors-General of the Dominions that it has been decided that Dominion officers and men dying in the United Kingdom shall he buried at the cost of the Home Government in single graves. The necessary land Avill he held in perpetuity aud the graves well cared for.CANADA.The issue of the third War Loan for 30,000,000Z., -in 5 per cent, bonds to mature in 20 years, is announced in the Press. The loan is issued at 96 per cent., and is redeemable in Canada and New York. It is stated that subscriptions will close on the 23rd instant.The Canadian Government have agreed to allow 1 7,000 Chinese coolies to travel across the Domiuion on their way to France from Weihaiwei. Precautions will be taken to prevent any of them remaining in Canada.AUSTRALIA.The Secretary of State has again pointed out to the Commonwealth Government the urgent need of ships for ocean traffic and has suggested that the charterers of certain ships engaged in coasting trade are relying on Commonwealth protection from being requisitioned hy the Home Government, and are therefore making no serious effoi-t to replace the ships with neutral or other tonnage. The Commonwealth authorities are therefore urged to requisition at least one of the vessels and warn the charterers that two others may be taken unless it is made clear that they are used on service of urgent necessity and that no other ships are available at market rates.The Governor-General has informed the Secretary of State that the production of lead in Australia has largely increased and now reaches a total of 10,000 tons per month. As it is urgently required for munitions, the Commonwealth Government wish the home authorities to settle the rate of freight. Up to the present lead has been carried at pre-war rates, viz., 16s. per ton, and the Australian. Government are committed to carrying 9,000 tons a month at that rate.The Governor-General has forwarded an address from, the Commonwealth Senate to His Majesty the King humbly expressing the hope that a just measure of Home Rule may be granted without undue delay to the people of Ireland. The address expresses the belief that at a time when the might of the Empire is being used to maintain the rights of self-government for small, nations, the people of Ireland would be made loyal and enthusiastic supporters of that high policy by the grant of the same rights.The 200 Maltese from New Caledonia who were detained in Sydney Harbour have now been permitted by the Government to land, as work has been found for them.Having been, asked, in Parliament whether it will be possible for Australian soldiers to record their votes promptly if the General Election takes place at the same time as large military operations, the Commonwealth. Government propose to reply that owing to the great offensive it will only be possible for a very small number of men on active service to vote at any. election held during the next eight months.The Governor-General reports that the Common wealth Government hope to send 2,000 navvies as soon as possible. It is expected that 1,000 will be sent during the first week in April.NEW ZEALAND.The number of men in training at the present time is 10,000. Compulsion under the Military Service Act is now in operation throughout the whole Dominion.
SOUTH AFRICA.The following information as to the number of troops supplied &apos;for. the various South African contingents and. their reinforcements has been, telegraphed to the&apos; Secretary of State&quot; by the Union Government:  Coit tin gent.	Number as at 1st February 1917.			Number despatched during month of February 1917, as Drafts.		Number undergoing Training and avail-able for Drafts.		Officers.         Men.		Nurses.	Officers.	Men.

African Forces.Though efforts are being made to improve recruiting, the results for the past month have not been so good as was expected. During February 1.205 men have been enrolled, and if the January figures are added, the total for the two months reaches 1,730.Considerable anxiety is being shown by the South African Government regarding the sixth, seventh and eighth infantry regiments which are now returning to the Union for recuperative leave from East Africa. While General Hoskins requires the troops back by the end of April, it seems that the greater proportion of the men will not be fit to return so soon. It is not possible to reopen recruiting for East Africa without interfering with recruiting for overseas. It was always understood that men returning from East Africa would be given the option of going to Europe, and after recuperation it is expected that many would volunteer for service in France. In any case there is a strong feeling among the troops against returning to East Africa, and as malaria has incapacitated the white troops to an alarming extent, the Union Government do not wish to renew their employment in that area.The Prime Minister of South Africa suggests as a solution that the War Office should utilise Belgian native troops, carriers and transport on a large scale.The Union Government have suggested that South African coal should be used for His Majesty&apos;s ships on the Naval Station, and thus enable Admiralty colliers to serve elsewhere. The Commander-in-Chief has replied that while the coal is not suitable for the Navy, there would, be no gain in freight by taking the colliers from their present work as they carry coal to East Africa and homeward, cargoes from Australia and Mauritius. He will, however, recommend a greater use of African coal if further freight from England is unobtainable.On his arrival in England Lieutenant-General J. C. Smuts made a statement to a Press Agency regarding the captured territory in Africa. . He said :--&quot; Nothing has &quot; given greater pleasure than Mr. Long&apos;s statement that no German colony can go &quot; back to Germany. The mere suggestion that any part should be returned is, of &quot; course, preposterous. I shudder to think what would happen to the native &quot; population if any part were returned. These people have stood by us magnificently, &quot; and our prestige in East Africa would severely suffer. The whole of South Africa, &quot; East Africa, South-West Africa, and Rhodesia would stand aghast at such an idea.&quot;EAST AFRICA.The Governor points out that the prohibition of coffee exportation to the United Kingdom will be disastrous to the planters, and asks for a licence to import 500 tons, which is the unshipped balance of the last crop.There are now 22,000 acres planted with coffee, and the 1917 crop is expected to reach 4,000 tons, and the 1918 crop 10,000 tons, but unless financial help of the nature suggested is forthcoming, the planters cannot continue over the next few months.
SWAZILAND.Information lias readied the High Commissioner for South Africa that a township has been laid out by the Portuguese Government at Nom ah ash a on the Swaziland-Portuguese boundary. As this involves an encroachment into disputed territory, and British interests will be adversely affected, the High Commissioner recommends an immediate protest to Lisbon.JAMAICA.The Governor urges that the requisitioning of three steamers of the Canadian Donald Line should be withdrawn on the ground that, they are practically the only British steamers available, and if they are taken the fruit trade (which is already in a precarious financial position) will be left almost entirely to foreign ships. More-( over, the vessels of the above-named line were specially built for carrying fruit and are unsuitable for long voyages.The sugar planters have urged upon the Governor that rum which had left the factory and was on the way to be shipped by 23rd February should be regarded as in course of transit and should be accepted for export.A Resolution in favour of conscription Avas introduced into the Council on 7th March by an elected member, and it was unanimously approved by elected and Government members. A] Bill for introduction at a later date is now being drafted. With regard to pensions and separation allowances, the Governor considers that the British rates should be applied generally, as it would be difficult to differentiate between men of European and non-Fmropean race.WINDWARD ISLANDS.The Governor has suggested that Canada, Australia, and India should be- requested! to prohibit importations of cocoa from foreign countries.CLYLON.The Secretary of State has informed the Governor by telegram that, owing to the-shortage of freight and the small stocks of food in the United Kingdom, it has been decided to requisition for essential work all British steamers on. Indian and Far-Eastern Liner services.PART II. FOREIGN AFFAIRS.FRANCE.The American delegates&apos; relief work having practically ceased in the invaded territory, the Germans have been in full control of supplies for the past month. There being little hope of the Americans&apos; permanent reinstatement, arrangements are-being made at the request of the Commission, to replace their services in Northern France provisionally by those of Dutch delegates. Sir W. Townley has been, directed to request the Netherlands Governments to arrange matters with the Germans if and when the Americans are finally withdrawn. It is understood that the nomination of all delegates must be made by the Directors of the Relief Commission, in consultation with the Allied Governments and in agreement with the neutral Governments concerned.BELGIUM.In reply to representations made by the Spanish Government in regard to the holding up of the Relief Commission&apos;s ships in British ports, and to the German Governments request for information concerning these vessels, Sir A. Hardinge has1 Also sent to Straits Settlements and Hong Kong. Similar telegrams have beet) sent to South, and East Africa and Somaliland regarding liners trading to or from Sont.li and East Africa.
.&quot;been instructed to state that in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government the-sole . object of the Germans is to tie up tonnage as much as possible. , Their expressed readiness &quot; in principle &quot; to grant safe conducts is contradicted by their owndeclara-. tion (5th March) that even on the north-about route they cannot yet declare: that, ships will be absolutely safe. Under these circumstances, His Majesty V Government -cannot place any faith in German intentions until the relief ships now awaiting permission to sail from Rotterdam in ballast for the United States shall have received unconditional and absolute, safe conducts.In regard to the proposal that a monthly subsidy of 500,000/, should be provided by the United. States for relief work, Sir C. Spring Rice reports that in the, existing ,-disturbed condition of affairs it is net advisable to raise the question ; for the present the Commission hopes to be able to raise up to 200,000/, a month from charitable gifts. Mr. Hoover (who was to leave New York for Europe on the 1.2th) proposes after consultation on this side to return to the United States and. then to take up the question of American financial assistance on a definite and liberal basis.GREECE.The events recorded, and. opinions exchanged during the past week tend to emphasise the difficulties that remain to be overcome before the Allies can hope to secure a definitely united, policy in Greece, On the 7th March, Lord &apos;Bertie was instructed to inform the French Government that in the opinion of His MajestyV Government, the continuance of the blockade may be justified on the grounds of the activities of the Reservists and the unsatisfactory number of rifles handed over, but that it cannot justly be maintained on grounds not covered by the Allies&apos;ultimatum of the Sth January. His Majesty&apos;s Government are most anxious to arrive without delay at a definitely co-ordinated, policy with which, if possible, Italy should be identified. As regards the proposed exchange of Allied Representatives, however, they see no reason, for removing Sir F. Elliot, in whose knowledge and judgment they have complete confidence.Discussing the possibility of devising a joint policy, Sir F. Elliot observes (9th. March) that neither of the policies separately pursued in Greece by France and. Italy is&apos;of a nature to commend itself to Great Britain. France - seeks to bring Greece under her own exclusive, or at least predominant influence ; Italy desires a weak Greece and supports the King so as to widen the breach between him and M: Venizelos. British interests require a strong Greece, drawn naturally rather to England than to any other Bower. In his opinion the object to be aimed at is a reconciliation between the King and M. Venizelos, which he believes to be not unattainable in the future. Lord Granville regards this prospect as hopeless (telegram of 10th March).As regards the raising of the;,blockade, Sir F. Elliot suggests (and His Majesty&apos;s Government approve) that without waiting for the counting of surrendered rifles (which matter is likely to be delayed, by the dilatory action of the French authorities) special delegates of the Allies should, he instructed to report each to his own. Government, giving his opinion as to the safety of General Sarraihs army. If the majority are of opinion that it is no longer menaced, the blockade should be raised. He considers that at the same time a new Government might be appointed ; it might not be better, but could, not be worse than the present one.Several events recently recorded point to latent unrest and. prospects of disorder, partly attributable, no doubt, to want of energy and sincerity on the part of the Government, but also in some measure due to the conflict between Royalists and Veuizelists and to the increasing irritation caused by the blockade.On the Sth March a French warship&apos;s boat&apos; taking off some Greek deserters from the shore at Batras was fired on by Greek soldiers. They were made prisoners and. taken aboard the French ship. The French Minister immediately protested to the Greek Government on the subject, with&apos; the result that the Captain of the Fort has been dismissed and. an apology made to the French Consul at Patras.A strong protest was addressed to the Greek Government by the British, and French Ministers on the 9th of March, with reference to the systematic terrorisation. carried on by small bauds of armed reservists in Epirus and Ithaca. The British and. French naval authorities are arranging to send, war ships to the districts concerned.On the 10th instant, His Majesty&apos;s Government directed. Sir F. Elliot to draw The attention of the Greek Government to the deplorable results of their failure2592- -2 i$
to take the steps necessary for requisitioning Greek vessels to transport foodstuffs to-Greece. There is good reason, to believe that at least half of the vessels, whose names have been furnished as available for recpdsitioning by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, are still lying idle. The Greek Charge d&apos;Affaires attributes this state of affairs to the fact that Greek Consular officials are frequently in sympathy with the Venizelists and that many shipowners refuse to obey requisition orders. The attitude of shipowners is also influenced by the failure of. the Greek Government to take steps to insure vessels requisitioned, and the absence of protection against submarine attacks. In this connection, Sir F. Elliot submits the opinion that, having seized the Greek fleet, the Allies cannot properly call upon the Greek Government to protect their shipping.Sir F. Elliot anticipates serious shortage of food early in April, owing to the non-arrival of expected, shipments, and therefore proposes obtaining certain supplies of maize, rice and beans from Egypt. His Majesty&apos;s Government are making arrangements at Athens through the Allied Board for an early rationing of the population.The local authorities in Crete have arrested and deported to Mytilene 12 Royalist politicians who were found to be secretly plotting with Reservists. Amongst them is M. Catzurakis, late Vice Presideut of the Chamber of Deputies at Athens.The inhabitants of the island of Cerigo being (as already reported) without either Royalist or &quot;Venizelist authorities, have declared their readiness to govern themselves, but ask that the Provisional Government should make them a grant-in-aid for the payment of officials. His Majesty&apos;s Government concur in the opinion of Sir F. Elliot that the island should raise the funds required from its own resources.The Commission to enquire into the indemnity claims arising from the events of the 1st December has not yet been constituted, the French Government adhering strongly to their view that it should consist of three members only one French, one British, and one Greek. After due consideration, His Majesty&apos;s Government are-prepared to urge this view upon the Greek Government, and Sir F. Elliot has been instructed accordingly.Having regard to recent cases in -which Venizelists have been arrested on political charges, His Majesty&apos;s representative has been directed to demand the release of all Venizelists in prison on such charges on the 31st December, and to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government strongly deprecate the continuance of this sort of persecution.The British and French Governments have jointly agreed to advance 11,000,000 francs for the mobilization of the Venizelist army and thereafter 4,000,000 francs a month for its maintenance. M. Venizelos has addressed an. urgent appeal to Lord Granville to obtain a relaxation of the restrictions on internal trade in Venizelist Greece, and Lord Granville, concurring in the advisability of the measure on political grounds, submits a scheme of control to be applied to traffic at and. between Venizelist ports.Sir F. Elliot reports (1.1th March) that the stoppage of neutral official telegrams-by the French naval censorship at Zante was a mistake which has now been corrected.GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.A Berlin wireless message to the &quot; Daily News,&quot; Chicago (6th March), describes the Gorman public as quite indifferent to the course of political events in the United States. In the Reichstag the secret session of the Budget Committee on the 5th discussed Herr Zimmermann&apos;s Mexican Note, with, the result that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s action was decisively vindicated.Another message refers to the relief felt in Berlin, upon the resumption of wireless-communication between Germany and the United States on the Sth instant.A report forwarded by His M.ajesty&apos;s Consul at Rotterdam states, on the authority of a British civilian released from Hamburg, that the firm of Bluhm and Voss are-turning out a submarine a week ; also that 200 submarines have been built at Kiel, of wdiich 175 are in use.Sir Walter Townley telegraphed on the 9th a summary taken from the &quot; Kolnische Zeitung&quot; of the speech delivered on the 7th instant in the Reichstag by Herr Michaelis, who foretold that the food census taken on 15th January would reveal a greater shortage of supplies than was anticipated ; to hold out with the country&apos;s. reduced stocks would not be possible unless the&apos;Government took strong measures to-regulate supply and demand.
SWITZERLAND;Negotiations have recently been proceeding with a view to an arrangement between the Swiss and the British and French Governments in regard to the im-portation of oil-cake cattle food into Switzerland, and the purchase of Swiss cattle by the Allies. Indirectly associated with these questions is that of the manufacture of munitions in Switzerland for both belligerents. Mr. Denys Cochin (French Minister for the blockade) is now opposed to the scheme advocated by the British Government (originally proposed by the French ambassador at Berne) for the purchase of Swiss cattle, although Lord Bertie has pointed out that failure to conclude this purchase would probably result in the export of 80,000 100,000 head of cattle to Germany. His Majesty&apos;s Government have cordially invited M. Cochin to come to London to discuss this question and others arising out of the blockade.HOLLAND.In a recent unofficial communication to Lord Robert Cecil, Sir W. Townley attributes Hollands readiness to accept German explanations and assurances (e.g., in regard to the torpedoing of seven Dutch steamers) to the weakness of the country&apos;s military defences.   The Dutch Government are aware that they have no means of protecting themselves against aircraft attacks, and that if Germany declared war, i Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and the Hague could speedily be reduced to ruins.   If the! Government jump at any pretext for putting upon England the blame for theirj! difficulties, it is because they realise this, and also because they know that Great! Britain has no desire to pick a quarrel with them or to see them dragged into the! war.   This being so, Sir W. Townley sees no prospect of getting the Dutch to sell] their ships to us or to agree to their being requisitioned.SWEDEN.Sir E. Howard reports that, complying with his request (vide last week&apos;s Summary), the Prime Minister has agreed to prepare a statement for publication, disavowing the recent Press attacks on the British Government and His Majesty&apos;s Legation.On the 7th instant, the political, situation was uncertain, and, judging by the Press, excited. Most of the papers attributed the Ministerial crisis to irreconcilable differences over the Anglo-Swedish Agreement, the Pro-German organs making violent attacks upon Great Britain whilst those of the Left, upholding the Agreement,-hinted at a possible coup d&apos;etat. Sir E. Howard expressed the opinion, however, that the crisis had been brought about chiefly by reason of the Prime Minister&apos;s autocratic attitude towards Parliament, and that concessions on his part would lead to an agreement between the parties. On the 1.0th he telegraphed that the opposition of the Right to the Anglo-Swedish Agreement had practically ceased and. that the situation had assumed a more hopeful aspect, the language of the Conservative Press having become much more moderate. His Majesty&apos;s representative has reason to believe that this change in the attitude of the Prime Minister and his supporters is largely-due to the advice of the German Minister, who realises that a complete blockade of Sweden would not be to Germany&apos;s advantage.SPAIN.Understanding that two vessels of the Hamburg-American Line are about to be sold to Spain, the French Government have instructed their Ambassador at Madrid to remind the Spanish. Government that France does not recognise the transfer of enemy ships to neutrals in war time. they have requested His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt similar action. The British Governments attitude in regard to this matter, as already laid down by instructions conveyed to Sir A. Harcliuge, has been based on the paramount importance of releasing tonnage for the purposes of the Allies ; it has therefore been of a nature to acquiesce in. the proposed sale of German ships under certain safeguarding conditions. Lord Bertie has now been instructed (13th March) to explain, the reasons underhying this policy to the French Government, and to urge them to accept it for the guidance of their Ambassador at Madrid.
PORTUGAL.Sir L. Carnegie reported on the 8th March that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had&apos; informed him that if the financial assistance asked for by the Portuguese Government to facilitate the purchase of wheat is not forthcoming, it will be necessaiy for the Minister of Finance to resign, a course which he himself would be compelled to follow. The whole policy of the Minister of Finance had been based on reliance on Great Britain&apos;s general promise to stand by her Allies. The minimum amount which Portugal requires to finance her imports of grain is l,too,OO0L; if Great Britain is not prepared to advance it, the Minister of Finance when resigning will&apos; suggest to Parliament, as a means of relieving die situation, the postponement of delivery to Great Britain of some of the ex-German ships and l.o use them for purposes of grain transport.On the 12th of March Sir L. Carnegie was instructed to inform the Portuguese Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government are seriously concerned at the delays which have taken place in the handing over of certain vessels urgently needed, for the purposes of the Allies, and at the general failure of the Portuguese authorities to carry out their agreement for allocation of Portuguese ships. The constant difficulties experienced with insubordinate crews, the heavy losses of chartered tonnage due to faulty navigation, combined with the refusal to allow the charterers to replace Portuguese by British crews, have created a deplorable situation, which calls for remedial measures without delay. Sir L. Carnegie&apos;s reply (14th March) states that in the opinion of the Portuguese Government our tonnage requirements have been fairly met and submits detailed information on which they base this opinion.CHINA.The premier&apos;s difference of opinion with the President, ending in the latteFs surrender, was followed on the 11th March by a vote of both Houses of Parliament in favour of the severance of relations with Germany, which took place on the 14th. That this means a triumph for the Conservative and alleged Royalist parties, as against the &quot; Young China&quot; Radicals, is proved by the fact that Sun Yat Sen has now come out openly in opposition to Cbina&apos;s entering the war on. the side of&quot; the Allies. In an article published at Shanghai on the 9th he predicts that the result will be anarchy in China and another Boxer rising; Mr. Alston has no doubt that this article is enemy-inspired. The lines of cleavage between the parties at Peking are thus made manifest; the policy pursued by Japan has secured the support of the Conservative faction, and the unconciliated element of Young China is therefore naturally inclined to throw in its lot with Germany, in this connection, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has drawn Mr. Alstoifs attention to the possibility.(of which His Majesty&apos;s Government have been warned) that the Germans in Shantung, Shanghai, and elsewhere, may be in. a position to instigate serious internal disorder with the aid of disaffected portions of the Chinese Army and of political malcontents. They have been reported to possess considerable supplies of arms and to be in communication with General Chang Hsiiu. Mr. Alston having been instructed to submit his opinion as to the possibility of their being able seriously to menace the internal situation, considers that these alarmist reports are part of the framework of normal German intrigue and rest on no valid foundation. The German ships at Shanghai were seized by the Chinese authorities on the 14th, without resistance.The Japanese Government do not think it advisable to give effect to the British Government&apos;8 proposal to join, forthwith in making definite and firm offers to China, assuring to her certain fiscal and financial advantages. They consider it preferable that China should first sever relations with Germany and that the representatives of the Allies at Peking should then meet and discuss the Chinese Governments proposals, as set forth in their recent note. Mr. Alston gathers that Japan&apos;s policy in this matter is influenced by fear that the Opposition might attack the Government in Tokio at the elections next month if the Chinese tariff were raised to an effective 5 per cent, without compensating advantages for the Japanese cotton manufacturers and others thereby affected.Anticipating the impending removal of the German engineers and staff from the northern section of the Tientsin-Pukou railway (of which the southern section is under British direction), Mr. Alston recommends that the British staff should take-over the administration of  the  entire  line,   thus  securing  control of  through-
communication from Shanghai, to Moukden. He fears that, if this is not done, the northern section Avill be maladministered by the Chinese to the detriment of the important British interests concerned, and with the probable result that the Japanese will offer to provide the necessary personnel. In regard to the latter contingency, Mr. Alston has been directed, in his discretion and in the event of pressure being brought by the Japanese Minister at Peking, to point out to him that the British Government is interested in the future of the German sections of the Tientsin-Pukou and Hukuang Railways, and to suggest that the three Governments should therefore discuss the matter before any decision is reached.The Netherlands Minister at Peking has received instructions to assume charge of German interests upon the severance of relations. His Majesty&apos;s Government, are of opinion that the extra-territorial rights enjoyed by Germans in China must necessarily lapse and. that German, subjects would pass therefore under Chinese territorial jurisdiction, so soon as China has definitely declared war, but that if relations are -only suspended their treaty rights would, remain in force.Mr. Alston has been instructed to renew formally His Majesty&apos;s Governments protest against the inclusion of Tibetan Deputies in the Chinese Parliament.In reference to the negotiations for a new loan to China by the International consortium, Sir C.  Spring Rice reports that the United States Government are f unwilling to authorise participation therein by American banks.   He ascribes this f to their unwillingness that China should take part in the war, and to their fear of jf increased Japanese influence resulting therefrom.JAPAN.Sir G. Greene has been directed, to inform the Japanese Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government have offered to purchase from China the enemy vessels in Chinese ports as soon as they have been seized by the Chinese Government, and therefore trust that the Japanese Government will withdraw from their proposals to lease these vessels for the present. His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared, if necessary, to arrange an allocation of these steamers when their purchase has been, completed.URUGUAY.Replying to an. enquiry by the Foreign Office, Mr. Mitchell Innes reports that his efforts to persuade the Uruguayan Government to requisition German ships, to facilitate the, transport of urgently-needed, coal supplies, have met with no success. There is no prospect of any such action being taken unless the United States or Brazil take the lead.MEXICO.Mr. Thurstan reports that the two protests entered by the United States against the provisions of the new Constitution have remained without reply. He is of opinion that no good purpose would be served by the British Governments entering a specific protest in regard to British interests in. Mexican oil-fields, but suggests that an identic note from all foreign representatives in Mexico, protesting against the Constitution generally, might prove effective. The United States Ambassador is in favour of this course and believes that the South American Republics would co-operate.In another despatch, Air. Thurstan reports a statement recently made by the t Mexican. Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Argentine Minister to the effect that, in the event of hostilities between Germany and the United States, the Mexican Govern-ment would declare war against the United States. They have information to the effect that Germany would attempt to set fire to the oil wells, and that Sehor Carranza is determined to resist by force any attempt by United States or British landing parties &apos; to protect them.NICARAGUA.His Majesty&apos;s representative at Guatemala, Mr. Young, reports a violent outburst of anti-American feeling in Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan Congress is moving to secure action by the President with a view to the withdrawal of the United States marines, and violent attacks have been made against the American management of the Custom House and the Railway Company. German instigation of this agitation is naturally 1 suspected.2092-3 m c
. &apos;        CUBA.The - Governments forces Lave captured ex-President Gomez and his principal adherents.   The general outlook is therefore encouraging;UNITED STATES.On the 10th March, Sir C. Spring Bice telegraphed that orders had been issued at Washington to arm merchant vessels, which will be authorised to lire at sight on any submarines in the war zone. War is generally considered to be inevitable. In a despatch of the following day, the Ambassador suggested the advisability of impressing on public opinion in Great Britain the fact that if the United. States are forced into war, it will be in defence of American rights and. not on behalf of the Allies. The country will fight not for Europe, but primarily for itself and ultimately for the cause of humanity.If and when war is declared, His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that the United States Government may be led to wind up or control firms doing business on behalf&apos; of enemy interests in the States, and also to adopt the black-list policy in regard to-enemy firms in South America.   Sir C. Spring Bice has been instructed, accordingly.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the course of a recent interview with the American Ambassador, laid stress on the great importance of supporting and extending Allied credit in the United States. Since then Sir C. Spring Rice has reported (9th March) the issue of the public statement by the Federal Reserve Board referred to in last weelts Summary, calculated to clear the way satisfactorily for the desired, financial operations. Sir R, Crawford describes the attitude of the Secretary of the Treasury as cordial and. helpful.On the 9th March Sir C. Spring Rice telegraphed that Mr. Wagner and his-associate 1 lerzog had come to Washington for the purpose of negotiating the sale of the seven uncaptured vessels of the Wagner fleet (known as the American Trans-Atlantic Line) to the United States Shipping Board. They were unwilling to deliver any documents in London or to negotiate at any place within British jurisdiction to transfer control of their ships to Great Britain. Under these circumstances His Majesty&apos;si Government have directed the Ambassador at Washington to remind the United States Government that, if these seven vessels are still at large it is only because, at the express request of the State Department, the British naval authorities-have refrained from capturing them pending the decision of the Prize Court test case. It is confidently expected that the three ships concerned in this case will be condemned as prizes. The American Ambassador in. London was informed in February 191(5 that if any vessels of this line were sold before the conclusion of the-test case, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be freed from their undertaking not to capture the remainder. Under these circumstances, any purchase of these ships by the United States Government could not fail to create a most unfortunate-impression.GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.The activities of the submarine continue to be effectively supported by the policy of intimidation pursued by German diplomacy and propaganda. A German wireless of the 8th instant to the &quot; New York American &quot; reports in extenso an interview between He it Zimmermann and an Austrian journalist, in which the Foreign Secretary says : &quot;The greatest service which neutrals can render to humanity at this moment &quot; is thoroughly to appreciate the fact that we mean what we say, and keep their ships. &quot; at home. Let neutrals consider the wonderful opportunity that their shipping will &quot; have, when the war ends, to carry goods to a half starving world. The immediate &quot; task resting on neutrals is to conserve tonnage, in. order to be able to seize this &quot; wonderful opportunity.&quot; To show that certain neutrals are adopting this advice, a German Government wireless of the same day quotes the &quot; Rotterdamsche Courant &quot; to the effect that billy seven ships had entered the port of Rotterdam during the week. 25th February-iird March.Another message to the &quot; New York American &quot; (9th March) commends &quot; the firm position of the Netherlands Government,&quot; and contrasts it unfavourably with Spaiits-decision to &quot; admit armed merchantmen on the same footing as peaceful vessels.&quot;
The policy of the Netherlands Government, as manifested in the case of the &quot;Princess Melita,&quot; has already been explained (vide under Holland). Sir W. Townley is of opinion that the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs is well disposed towards us, but that the pressure exercised by Germany is irresistible, and that the spleen thereby-engendered is worked off by the Government against England.In regard to this case, Sir W. Towniey has been directed to represent plainly to the Dutch Government that, while they are asking England to forego her belligerent rights (by exempting Dutch ships from calling at a port in the United Kingdom and thus increasing their safety) they are insisting on increasing the dangers incurred by-British ships by excluding them, when armed, from their harbours. In other words, the Dutch are assisting the German submarine campaign. Discussing the question f with Sir W. Townley on the 12th instant, the Minister for Foreign Affairs declared I that any change in Hollands policy, to England&apos;s advantage, would be construed by j Germany as an unfriendly act; that the German Minister had already protested^ strongly on the ground that the &quot; Princess Melita &quot; should have been, interned. He undertook to discuss the matter with the Cabinet, but Sir W. Tbwnley sees little hope of their doing anything which might provoke Germany to wrath. In other respects the situation as regards Dutch shipping shows some signs of improvement. The agricultural agreement is being satisfactorily carried out; so much so that, on the 13th instant, His Majesty&apos;s Government decided to release the Dutch ships with cargoes of fodder and fertilisers. It is understood that the regular lines trading to England will shortly resume sailings on the same scale as before the 1st February ; also that the Dutch trawler fleet (having been guaranteed immunity from German attacks) has decided to put to sea again on the 15th instant. Sir Walter Townley is of opinion that, notwithstanding the &quot;Princess Melita&quot; case, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. should not revoke the permission given for Dutch ships to proceed direct to Pfalifax in ballast.The representations addressed to the Danish Government appear to have produced some effect, inasmuch as His Majesty&apos;s Minister was able to report on the 9th instant that three Danish steamers would probably- leave Bergen for Great Britain not later than the 11th. At the same time the Danish Government issued a notice prohibiting all publication of movements of ships to and from Denmark. Sir R. Paget considers that the difficulty of arranging for insurance is an important factor in preventing the resumption of normal traffic, and fears that if one of these trial-trip vessels should be lost, another deadlock will ensue. Meanwhile, with a view to bringing increased pressure to bear, His Majesty&apos;s Government are taking steps to prevent any goods reaching Denmark from, overseas for the present, by limiting the opportunities for Danish ships to call at Halifax and by delaying them, when there, on the ground of naval and military exigencies and inadequate facilities. All publicity in regard to these measures is being carefully avoided.In. recognition of the friendly and helpful attitude of the Norwegian Government , and. shipowners, instructions have been issued to the Indian and Colonial authorities I concerned that no Norwegian vessels are to be refused clearance in future under the j instructions recently arising out of the submarine blockade.   Since 8th February, 64 f Norwegian ships have been released from United Kingdom ports with cargoes for j Norway ; in the same period 29 ships have arrived from Scandinavia and Iceland. The Norwegian Government have  drafted, and communicated to  His  Majesty&apos;s Minister, a law providing for the chartering of tonnage for Norvvay&apos;s requirements and to ensure her regular coal supply.   The question of Great Britain&apos;s acquiring, arming and using Norwegian ships for the purposes of Anglo-Norwegian trade is under discussion, and formed the subject of a telegraphic report by Sir M. Findlay on the Sth March.The position of affairs in Sweden remains practically in statu quo, and the question of the Kogrund passage is still unsettled. As regards this question, Sir E. Howard considers that, in view of certain misleading statements recently attributed to. the Swedish Prime Minister in the Press, it would oe useful to publish the identic Note of the Allied Powers sent on the 17th October 1916, in reply to the Swedish Note of the 9th September, thus manifesting the fact that, so far from expressing satisfaction with the Swedish Governments action, the Powers have vigorously maintained their protest against it. With the concurrence of the French Government, His Majesty-&apos;s Government have decided to adopt this course by means of a question in the House of Commons, and to emphasise the fact that, so lately as the 19th of February the Swedish Government had  been requested to rescind
or at least modify a course of action unfair to the Allies and involving an infringement of their Treaty rights.Having reference to the disposition of Swedish shipowners to follow Germany&apos;s advice by laying up their ships, Sir E. Howard suggests (13th instant) that they are not likely to be dissuaded, from this course unless His Majesty&apos;s Government can see their way to modify the present working of the regulations which, releases a Swedish vessel for every one that arrives at a port in the United Kingdom, irrespective of ownership. He submits that it is necessary to guarantee that any individual shipowner fulfilling our conditions should be sure of having his return cargo without delay. Finally, he points out that the omission of pit props and timber from the list of approved cargoes will make it more difficult to secure the resumption of regular sailings.GENERAL;A despatch from. Sir W. Townley of the 10th March states that the Germans are preparing all suitable private houses at Brussels and other towns in the vicinity (but not in the Liege district) for the reception of wounded. They are also commandeering all linen from private persons at Brussels.Germany has rejected the British Governments proposal to remove prisoners of war to a distance of 20 kilometres from the front, maintaining insistence on a distance of 30 kilometres. The German Governments reply to the British Note on this subject has been communicated to Sir W. Townley by the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, it declares that until a satisfactory undertaking has been given by Great Britain in regard to the housing and feeding of German prisoners at the distance specified, British prisoners will be employed within the zone of lire, on the Russian as well as the Western front, in the same way as Germans are actually employed by the British Army.4
