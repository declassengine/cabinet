SECRET.APPRECIATION  OP THE  ATTACHED WESTERN  AND GENERAL-REPORT, No.  13,Greece.The French Government is clearly determined to make any modus vivendi with King OonstantineAs Government impossible, and to create a situation which will afford a colourable pretext for insisting on his abdication and for occupying Thessaly. As it intends to take the military measures implied by this policy, whether the British General. Stall approve or not, the only choice left for the British Government is likewise to reserve to itself the liberty to review the extent and purpose of British military co-operation at Salonika. Meanwhile Italy, hitherto the most determined opponent of the French policy, seems to have swung round into almost complete acquiescence. The motive or inducement which has brought about so remarkable a change of attitude has not yet been disclosed.Resistance on the part of the Greeks is probable, and may prove much more serious than the French apparently imagine.German Internal Affairs.The attitude of the Russian Socialists is evidently having its effect on the German Socialists, at any rate to the extent of encouraging them to demand a declaration from, the German Government in favour of a peace &quot; without annexation or indemnity.&quot; The story from Copenhagen, about herr H.aase&apos;s explanation of Germany^ motives in professing readiness for such a peace is probably garbled. But undoubtedly it might pay the Central Powers to use a phrase of such seeming moderation as &quot;no annexation and no indemnities&quot; in order to inveigle Russia into a peace which meant no indemnities for Belgium, Serbia, Routnania or devastated. France, the restoration to their previous owners of the German Colonies and of Armenia and Mesopotamia, the retention of Alsace-Lorraine and. Posen, of Galicia, the Trentino and Trieste, and the maintenance intact of the German influence over the whole Berlin-Baghdad area.Sweden.The British agreement is still hanging lire. It remains to be seen whether the Swedish Government will be forced by public opinion and the shortage of foodstuffs to fall into line, or will succeed in using the course of the negotiations as an argu-ment to work up anti-Entente feeling both among the Swedish public and at the forthcoming Scandinavian Conference at Stockholm.
Spain.The resignation of Count Romanones and the formation of the Prieto Government marks a success for the German Ambassador and for German propaganda in Spain, at any rate lor the moment, and shows that Spanish public opinion as a whole is not yet ready to abandon the idea of preserving neutrality at all costs. It does not follow that Spain will allow her ships to be torpedoed indefinitely.Mexico.The Mexican situation is increasingly disquieting. The British Minister and the American Ambassador evidently take very different views as to the right way of dealing with President Carranza.L. S. A.20th April 1917.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.   -A Resolution concerning the representation of India at future meetings of the Imperial Conference was passed at a meeting of the Imperial War Conference on loth April, and telegraphed by the Secretary of State to the oversea Governments. This Resolution expressed the view that the Resolution of the Imperial Conference of 20th April 1907 should be so modified as to allow India to be fully represented at all future Imperial Conferences, and that the necessary steps should, be taken to secure the assent of the various Governments in order that the next Imperial. Conference might bo summoned and constituted accordingly. The Government of Newfoundland have already telegraphed agreeing to the full representation of India in the future.A Resolution passed at the Conference on 10th. April relating to constitutional relations has been telegraphed, to Australia. This resolution stated the opinion of the Conference that the readjustment of the constitutional relations of the Empire was too intricate a matter to be dealt with during the war, and that it should be considered at a special Conference to be summoned as soon as possible after-hostilities cease. The view was, however, recorded, that any readjustment should recognise the right of the Dominions and India to a voice in foreign policy, and. should provide for continuous consultation on matters of Imperial interest.A further Resolution passed, on 23rd April was also telegraphed to the-Commonwealth. Tins affirmed the desirability of forming an Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, representative of the countries of the Empire, to collect information upon, and advise as to the development of the mineral resources of the Empire. The British Government was recommended, in the resolution to take immediate steps to establish the Bureau, and to submit a scheme to the Governments who had been summoned to the Conference.A. Resolution recording the impracticability of proceeding with, the Dominions House scheme, put forward by Earl. Grey, was also passed at the Conference and telegraphed to Australia.GENERAL.The Dominion Governments have been informed, that imports /will be allowed into the United Kingdom of dried fruits produced, within the British Dominions. Canned, bottled, and preserved fruit will be licensed, up to a limit corresponding to 50 per cent, of the imports of 1910.Another telegram, to the Dominion Governments announces that, owing to the submarine policy of the German Government announced on 1st February, exports from the United Kingdom to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Holland will only be licensed if carried in ships owned by the country of ultimate - destination. The desire is expressed that the Dominions will institute a similar arrangement.CANADA.The building of a large number of wooden ships by the Imperial Munitions Board of the Dominion is announced in a telegram to the Press. It is stated, that the Canadian Government will lend the Board 2,000,OOOL for this purpose.The Admiralty have inquired whether the Dominion can supply labour for British, shipbuilding and repairing 3-ards without interfering Avith the carrying out of orders upon which Canadian yards are now engaged for the Ministry of Shipping.In further reply to the inquiry addressed to them by the Admiralty, the Dominion Government state that motor boats can be constructed for Italy by Mr. McDonald, of Nova Scotia, without any interference with the Canadian output of merchant ships.The Canadian Patriotic Fund Authorities, who have already raised -$21,000,000, and pledged -$14,000,000 for the year beginning 1st April 1917, for the support of the dependants of Canadian soldiers, have (according to the &quot;New York Tribune &quot;) been invited to advise the United States regarding the organisation of Patriotic Funds lor the American Navy. For this purpose Sir Herbert Ames, M.P. (Hon. Secretary of the Canadian Patriotic Fund) has been visiting the United States.
NEWFOUNDLAND,The Government have agreed that the Patriotic Association should raise five-forestry companies of 100 each,&apos;5 or more if necessary.   The expenses up to the time of embarkation will he found by the Government, and the men will he ready to sail on 15th May.   There are also railway men, miners,-and other skilled men ready to-enlist if the British Government state that they are required.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The Commonwealth Government have been informed that, in anticipation of shortage of supplies, the New Zealand Government are desirous of securing an option on about 1,500,000 bushels of Australian wheat, now arranged for September-December delivery to the British Wheat Commission. The Commission were willing to allow New Zealand to take this wheat at cost price, but as it had been, bought for the Allies as well as for the British authorities, the consent of the Commonwealth Prime Minister was sought for an alteration in the contract submitted by him. By telegram of the 19th April, however, the Commonwealth Government intimate that they cannot agree to the suggestion.In contemplation of the presence of a raider, the Japanese Government have sent, a squadron, at the request of the Admiralty, to patrol the eastern coast of Australia and New Zealand waters.The Secretary of State has pointed out the great difficulty in which the United Kingdom and the Allies have been placed by the embargo on wheat exportation from the Argentine. The position would be materially improved if a promise could be made that the 300,000 tons of Argentine wheat already purchased will be replaced, by Australian wheat between June and December. The agreement of the Common-wealth is sought upon this, and if this is attained it is suggested that sailing vessels which cannot go to Europe might be utilised for the transport of the Australian wheat.With reference to the enquiries upon the subject of the Commonwealth financing the capital expenditure of the States, the British Treasury have replied that direct Exchequer advances are not possible. They suggest, however, that the Treasury; should advance money to meet the war expenditure of the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom, although the war funds in the Commonwealth show a credit balance. It could then be determined by the Australian Government whether the credit balance could be used temporarily in order to enable loans to be made to the States.It is added that the participation of the United States in the war may so help the financial position that a further Commonwealth:, loan might possibly be floated in. London later in the year.SOUTH AFRICA.In reply to the enquiry regarding export licences for Katanga, Railway plant, the Union Government point out that there is a general prohibition upon exportation from South Africa of goods which are not manufactured in that country and which cannot now be obtained from the United Kingdom. The Minister, however, will give all help possible in order to permit of Katanga copper being produced and sent to the United Kingdom.The Governor-General reports that the Native Affairs Administration Bill was carried in the House of Assembly by 64 votes to 42. The Unionist Natal Members,, together with the Labour party, voted against the Government and Nationalists. The Bill will not be taken through its other stages till next Session.RHODESIA.The Secretary of State has informed the High Commissioner that it appears the Rhodesian platoons must remain in Rhodesia at present owing to the position in Bortuguese East Africa. He expresses the hope, however, that they may be ultimately taken to France to serve with the South African Infantry Brigade. ; : .The second Native unit of 1,000 are now in training, but their progress is being checked by lack of rifles which the Union Government are unable to lend them.  .* See Western and General Report for week ending IStli April 1.917.
BASUTOLAND.The Secretary of State has been informed that a discussion in the Council indicates that four native labour companies will probably be raised. While the commissioned officers and some of the non-commissioned officers will be provided in South Africa, it is suggested that the rest of the non-commissioned officers might be chosen, in consultation with Sir Herbert Sloley, from those in the South African Contingent who are unfit for active service.With regard to the welfare of the Labour Contingent in France, the Resident Commissioner has reported that it would be entirely consistent with the tribal custom for some oE the Chiefs to go to France on behalf of the Paramount Chief in order to inform the nation as to the conditions of the natives. It is therefore suggested that three chiefs should proceed on this mission in a civilian capacity, and that on their arrival in this country they should be put under the care of Sir Herbert Sloley, who could arrange for the visit to their people in France.GOLD COAST.The Secretary of State has been informed that 500 men are now on their way to East Africa by the &quot; City of Sparta.&quot;The Aborigines Protection Society of the Colony have raised another 1,500L in order to purchase a second aeroplane.&quot;LIBERIA.The Government have decided to sever diplomatic relations with Germany, and they have enquired if Liberia may rely upon the immediate protection of the Allied Powers.EAST AFRICA PROTECTORATE.With reference to the recruiting of Arabs and natives on the coast for the King&apos;s African Rifles, it has been decided by the Governor and the Executive Council that compulsory service shall be applied to the native community, it is pointed out that this action will be in agreement with Arab custom, which recognises the obligation to serve during periods of national crisis.GERMAN EAST AFRICA.The Administrator has been informed that the Belgian authorities have agreed to co-operate still further in a military direction in order to bring the East African campaign to a close. No conditions have been made as to territorial or political concessions in relation to this help. The actual nature of the assistance will be discussed between General Hoskins and the Belgian Commandant, but it will probably7 consist of two or three columns based on Tanganyika and Tabora. It has been laid clown by the Belgians that their Commandants shall control the personnel of the columns, inclusive of the carriers.ZANZIBAR.The Government have offered a further sum of 20,000Z. to the British Government for the purposes of the war.CEYLON.The Governor has been informed that the cocoa exports from British possessions in the year commencing 23rd February are to be reduced to an amount corresponding to hall the similar exports, of the previous year. Under these circumstances, the exportation of cocoa from Ceylon to the United Kingdom will be prohibited except under licence.
PART . II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ALLIED COMMON AFFAIRS,His Majesty&apos;s Government have approved in principle certain proposals put forward by Mr. Hoover, ex-Chairman of the Belgian Relief Commission, for the establishment in the United States of an International Provisioning Board, to control food supplies for all the Allies. The scheme is under consideration by the State Department, and it is understood that the United States Government will take the initiative in recommending it to the French and. Italian Governments.BELGIUM.The new Committee for Relief Work, to be organised on the lines proposed, by His Majesty&apos;s Government, has not yet commenced work, owing to the continued, delays in the appointment of the Spanish and Dutch doint-Chairmen. These delays are largely due to the action of the Germans, who, as explained in last week&apos;s Report, are taking every advantage of the situation created, by the withdrawal of the American delegates. Information received by His Majesty&apos;s Government shows that in violation of their solemn pledges they are now neutralising the work of the Commission by removing from Belgium large quantities of foodstuffs and cattle. Under these circumstances, and also because of the torpedoing of relief ships, His Majesty&apos;8 Government are doubtful as to the advisability of permitting the&apos; continuance of the Relief Commission^ work ; for the present, instructions have been issued to stop all shipments of fats and meats to Belgium, but unless satisfactory assurances can be obtained from the Germans by the Spanish Government, the position, will require to be entirely reconsidered. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Madrid has been instructed to suggest that it would assist matters if His Majesty the King of Spain were to indicate special interest in the prompt and effective organisation of the new Committee.In view of all the facts attendant upon the torpedoing of Relief ships by German submarines, His Majesty&apos;s Government have been reluctantly compelled, to the conclusion, that these outrages have been deliberately planned and that the German Government intend to continue to commit them. Pending further examination of the whole question, the Relief Commission have been informed that, in the absence of evidence and guarantees for their security, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not feel justified in permitting further sailings of Relief vessels.;    The Dutch Chairman of the Committee has been appointed, by the Minister for Foreign A If airs.   His name is Langenberg ; he has hitherto been employed in the Dutch Legation at Brussels.   The Spanish representative has been selected in the person of. Seiior Pedro Saura, a consular official now employed in Berlin, who is expected to take up his duties without delay.GREECE.The French Governments proposal (vide Report No. 1.1), that none of the Allied Ministers at Athens should visit the King without reference to, and consultation between, the Allied Governments, would appear to have been made with foreknowledge of the King&apos;s intention to negotiate terms. On. the 18til April, His Majesty sent for Sir F. Elliot and expressed his readiness to change his Government, provided that he were assured against dethronement or against invasion8of Greek territory by the French, which he would resist. He asked whether the appointment of M. Zaimis as Prime Minister would lead to better relations with the Entente. To Sir F. Elliots suggestion that his good intentions would best be proved by the dismissal of General Dousmaris and others, he replied that he had no right to send them away
-and they would refuse to go. He showed no signs of desiring a reconciliation with M. Venizelos. On the same day His Majesty saw M. Zaimis, who expressed the opinion that it would be useless for him or anyone to form a new Cabinet, or to endeavour to.remove the influences hostile to the Entente, unless the Allies first gave a proof of their confidence, such as the raising of the blockade. On the gist Lord Bertie reported that the French Government, desiring to retain complete liberty of action, had. instructed their Minister at Athens not to assume any responsibility in the matter of a change of Ministry. They had, however, previously informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that, no fresh instructions has been sent to their agents in. -Greece respecting maintenance of the status quo-.At the Conference held at St. Jean de Maurienne between Ministers of Great Britain, France&apos; and Italy, the possibility of renewed attacks upon Venizelists was. considered, as well as the possible necessity, in that event, of insisting upon the King&apos;s abdication, but no definite instructions in this sense were formulated for the guidance of the Allied Ministers at Athens. The result of the Conference, as eon-veyed to Sir F. Fdliot on the 22nd, was that the Ministers agreed generally to communicate the following opinions and conclusions to their respective Govern-ments :  AI. Utbot was of opinion that the attitude of the Greek Government could no longer be tolerated, and that the unreliable character of the King and his Ministry made it necessary to take precautions and impose penalties. Decision as to the military measures to be adopted (such as the occupation of Larissa) was postponed pending reference to the French and British General Staffs, each Government reserving full liberty of action in the event of their failing to agree. M. Ribot was also of opinion that, the passage of Greek troops from the Peloponnese must be stopped and that the King should, be warned, that anything in the nature of violent measures - would involve him in disaster. In the event of bloodshed, he considered (Mr. Lloyd George concurring) that his abdication must follow. Baron Sonnino urged the maintenance of the Constitution and- hoped that the Crown Prince would be allowed to succeed to the Throne. All. the Ministers were agreed that republican propaganda and. constituent assemblies should be avoided in. Greece.Baron Sonnino readily assented to Af. Ribops proposal that the British Army should be represented in Corfu, disclaiming any designs on the part of Italy to establish herself in the island. At his suggestion it was agreed that the Royalist authorities of Corfu should not be replaced by Venizelists. In this connection it is of interest to note that Sir C. des Graz and His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Corfu have both reported (23rd April) the existence of considerable friction between the French and. Italian military authorities in the island. The French General Officer Commanding would welcome the presence of a British Force, however small, or even of a British military hospital. Sir C. des Graz says that there is no doubt that the Italians hope and wish to remain in the island.   They are distinctly unpopular with the inhabitants.Referring to the conclusions of the Conference above summarised, Sir F. Elliot disagrees with the opinion of the French Prime Minister as to the attitude of the Greek Government. Also he considers that if Larissa is to be occupied, the fact should be announced in advance and explained as a matter of military necessity without participation of Venizelist forces. He thinks it would be opposed if the Greek Government were led to regard it as intended to cover the seizure of crops in Thessaiy. Finally, he advises that if new demands are to be made on the King of Greece, they should be formulated without delay and clearly stated, as a condition of nervous tension is developing from the present uncertainty. On the 24th, the King sent word to His Majesty&apos;s Minister that he hoped to see him again in a few days, to Avhich Sir F. Elliot replied that pending receipt of instructions from His majesty&apos;s Government, an audience would serve no good purpose. His own view of the situation is that invasion by foreign troops or Venizelists will be resisted by the Royalists and will inevitably lead to massacres and possibly even to the Entente Legations being taken as hostages. Nevertheless, he does not include the King &quot; among those whose interests or sympathies are on the side of the Germans.&quot; It is of interest to note, in this connection, that His Majesty has been stirred to indignation by the charges brought against him in an article of &quot; Le Temps,&quot; and has sent to the French Minister at Athens for transmission to the French Government, a formal and categorical denial of the acts and opinions-therein attributed to him.   In particular,
tlie Note declares it to be &quot; absolutely false that His Majesty has ever received, from. &quot; a sovereign of the camp hostile to the Entente, any telegram, warning, or advice &quot; whatsoever with regard to the policy to be pursued in upholding his Throne.&quot;On .19th April Lord Granville reported, as the result of further conversations with M. Venizelos, that his suggestion of a Republic as a solution of the Greek question was in the nature of a pis-aller. He had regretfully come to the conclusion that, failing an. English Prince for the Throne, or the immediate accession of the Grown Prince, a, Republic was the most probable solution. On the 20th M. Venizelos expressed the opinion that the only possible means of avoiding civil war would be for the King to abdicate at once in favour of the Crown Prince, the latter giving the necessary guarantees and removing the leaders of the pro-German faction. As regards the use of force, he was far from suggesting violent measures, but if the Allies decided to adopt them, he would be delighted; more than this, he was prepared, once his mobilisation was complete, to use two divisions of the national army for the occupation of Athens and the removal of the King.On the 19th April a note was sent by the Greek Government to Sir F. Elliot formally protesting against the occupation of Zante, Cephalonia, Ithaca and Skopelos by Allied forces and the administration of the islands by 10 members of the seditious Committee of Salonika.&quot; On the 20th, Lord Granville, acting under instructions, informed the Provisional Government that His Majesty s Government were opposed to-National representatives or police being sent to the islands. On the following day M. Venizelos replied that they had already been established there for some days and he hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not insist on their removal. He did not propose to send anyone to Cerigo, but had merely telegraphed instructing the de facto Governor to announce that he worth! act henceforward under the authority of the Provisional Government, which instructions he had subsequently cancelled in deference to the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The French Government have agreed to accept the original scheme for the re-establishment of Controls, as drawn tip by the Allied Committee at Athens, and the Greek Government will be notified accordingly.At a meeting of the Military Control Commission it was agreed that the strength of the patrols established at Corinth and at the two Canal ferries (10 men) is insufficient to keep a proper watch over the passage of men from out of the Morea, and it was therefore proposed to request General Sarrail to detach a force for the purpose. Sir F. Elliot, reporting on this proposal (21st April), condemns it unreservedly as likely to create a breach of the peace and &quot; possibly lead to another 1st of December.&quot; He has requested the British military representative on the Commission to convey to General Cauboue his protest against the proposal being carried out without the approval of all the Allied Governments. On the 23rd the French Admiral in Salamis Strait reported that a French boat, conveying men for the night patrol at Corinth Canal, had been tired on by a Greek sentry.As a temporary expedient, and with a view to enabling Greece to obtain urgently-needed supplies, His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed to allow the insurance of Greek requisitioned grain ships to be placed in London under certain specified conditions. As such insurance might prove an additional incentive to the enemy to sink these ships, His Majesty&apos;s Government request that the Greek authorities should make representations to the German Government so as to ensure that the vessels may not be attacked by submarines. Pending the gathering of the Thessalian harvest the food problem must continue to present grave difficulties. Sir F. Elliot states that owing to the snspension of sailings from America &quot;there Jwill be no bread at all in Greece for at least three weeks from 4th May,&quot; and British officers have reported a state of famine in many districts of Morea. His Majesty&apos;s Government proposes, as an experiment, to supply wheat front India, the Commission selling it to the Greek Government. f.o.b. at Indian ports. By this means it is hoped to economise tonnage and to provision Greece more expeditiously. Meanwhile the&apos; protection of the Thessalian harvest is becoming a cause of serious anxiety to Venizelist Greece. Lord Granville reports (23rcl April), on the authority of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Salonika, that Thessaly is beginning to be invaded by harvest workers, who are really emissaries of the Royalist Government, sent for the purpose of seizing the crop when the time comes. There is also a, rumotir of a plan to burn it, devised by General Dousmanis.
GERMAN INTERNAL&apos;; AFFAIRS.A German wifeless of 18th April to the Hearst Press states that as the result of the negotiations between the Berlin authorities and the representatives of the strikers on Monday the 16th, the control and distribution of food has been practically handed over to a Workmen&apos;s Commission, which will act in consultation Avith the Municipal and Government officials. The authorities have promised to take vigorous measures whenever the Commission shall bring to their notice cases of &quot; backstairs sneak trade,&quot; whereby- the well-to-do are enabled, to obtain foodstuffs over and above the amount to which they are entitled as rations. It is asserted that for the benefit of these people a flourishing trade is done in butter at 10s. a lb., eggs at 9s. a dozen, and sugar at 8s. a lb.During the recent negotiations at Berne dor the prolongation of the present German-Swiss agreement, the Swiss were informed that the German authorities had discovered that their stock of potatoes was not so low as they had supposed, and they were therefore about to hand over to Switzerland the balance of the quantity deliverable under the terms of the agreement.A report received through Copenhagen states that at a recent meeting of Socialists at Berlin, Herr Jiaase and other speakers declared that German officialdom is by no means disposed to abandon the hope of securing territorial annexations, and that the object of the German Government in professing readiness for a peace without annexations is to lure the Allies into a Conference at which they might be divided, &quot;whereupon Germany would resume hostilities under improved, conditions.The following interesting explanation of the official German attitude towards the United States was given in a wireless message to the New York &quot; Mail &quot; on the 18th April: &quot;President Wilson must know by this time that Germany would never &quot; have taken the steps which practically forced him to declare a state of war, if the &quot; nature of his untiring efforts to bring about a world peace had been fully realised. &quot;The obstacles to private communication between Germany7 and America, and the &quot; Jong delay in Count Berustorffs homeward A^oyage (undoubtedly7 planned by the &quot; British Government) combined to create a crisis Avhich none regret now more than. &quot; the Germans. Unless the United States forces her to do so, Germany7 will be A7ery. &quot; reluctant to enter upon, aggressive warfare. It is realised here that Wilson has &quot; achieved a position which, will make him a powerful factor at the Peace Conference.. &quot; Unless the relations between, the two countries become more strained, the German &quot; Government will welcome his taking part in the negotiations, because they realise &quot; that, after all, the aims of America as outlined by Wilson in his December peace &quot; Note are identical with those of Germany7, to wit the freedom of the seas and the &quot; right of every nation to choose its own government.&quot;From a well-informed neutral source it is reported that Germany is exceedingly hard pressed for transport, on account of shortage of locomotives ; that the loss of one engine means more to the German, authorities than the loss of six guns. Passenger trains have ceased to run between Hamburg and Sassnitz.AUSTRIAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.A report from an official source states that there is a very strong desire for peaces throughout Hungary7, although the scarcity of food is much less than in Austria. The Hungarian Government build great hopes on the possibility of coming to terms with Russia, and in any7 event they7 consider that the Russian Army is no longer in a condition to take the offensive. They7 would be quite prepared to agree to the restoration of Serbia, provided they7 could, retain a strip of territory along the Danube to connect Hungary with Bulgaria. Their feelings against Rumania remain very hostile. They are much disturbed by7 the rupture of their relations with the United States ; it invoL7es, inter alia, the cessation of remittances by Hungarians in America amounting to 250 million crowns a year.Information communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne by the United States ex-Charge d&apos;Affaires; en route from A^ienna, goes to show that A.ustria&apos;s rupture of relations with the United States was forced upon the Government by Germany, and that this AAras done on the occasion of the meeting between the two Emperors. According to this authority, the Austrians bitterly resent the pass to which the war has brought them, and are opposed to the submarine campaign ; but they are so tied and bound to Germany7 that there would, appear to be no prospect of inducing them to make a separate peace.2342-1 c
SWITZERLAND.Sir JL Rumbold reported on the 18th April that the French Government have ratified the draft agreement in regard to rationing for Switzerland, and to the export -of munitions of war to the Allies. He considers- it urgently necessary that the British agreement should he ratified without delay, in order that the measures therein contemplated may be taken to counteract German pressure.M. Denys Cochin, French Minister of Blockade, has not gone to Berne, as he had intended, to discuss his alternative proposals for limiting the export of Swiss cattle to Germany, and other collateral questions. His proposals, however, have been placed before the President of the Swiss Republic, and he has subsequently discussed them with the Swiss Government by telegraphic correspondence from Paris. Unaware of these negotiations, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne has been independently engaged in endeavouring to obtain the Swiss Governments assent to M. Cochin&apos;s scheme. On the 21st April he reported that, under certain conditions, the Swiss Government would undertake to limit their export of cattle to Germany to 40,000 head, the Presidents change of front in this matter being no doubt due to M. Cocbiits representations. Sir IT. Rumbold recommends that the agreement be concluded as -soon as possible, and that it be confined to the questions of cattle, oilcake and condensed milk, as the Swiss Government are not prepared to settle the timber question without introducing various other matters, which would involve further, negotiations. The Swiss Government stipulate that, if an agreement is concluded on the lines proposed, the Rationing Commission will settle reserved groups on favourable lines before the end of April.His Majesty&apos;s Minister has been directed, to draw the attention of the Swiss Government to their recent export of locomotives to Austria and to state that the matter is regarded with grave concern by the British Government.SCANDINAVIAN  CONFERENCE.Sir M. Findlay reports that arrangements have been made to hold a Conference of the Scandinavian Kingdoms at Stockholm in May ; each country to be represented by its Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is expected that the Conference will discuss (1) the probable economic results of the United States&apos; declaration of Avar ; (2) practical measures for making Scandinavia self-supporting by inter-State exchange of supplies ; and (8) the possibility of maintaining trade with Germany.   Sir R. Paget reports that the Conference will open on Oth May.&apos;SWEDEN.The Foreign Office has informed Sir E. Howard that, while the Swedish Governments draft of proposed agreement (vide last Report) affords a basis for negotiations, His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the Kogrund Channel question as quite distinct from the questions of commerce and navigation covered by the draft agreement, and are not disposed to settle the latter until, the Kogrund. question has been satisfactorily arranged, at all events in principle. Sir E. Howard is instructed to insist on the Swedish Government undertaking to allow the detained vessels to leave the Baltic as rapidly as arrangements can be made by the British authorities, and, whenever practicable, with cargoes of sawn timber. Subject to acceptance of this arrangement, Mis Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to facilitate the movements of Swedish shipping under specified conditions, as well as the release of grain aTessels, and to consider the other proposals of the draft agreement. The Swedish offer to grant &quot; reasonable facilities &quot; for the Russian transit trade is, however, not acceptable, especially at a moment when the entry of the United States into the Avar enables the Allies to exercise a far higher degree of control over Swedish commerce. Finally, as a matter of policy, His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to give to the pro-German Swartz and Lindman Ministry terms more favourable than Avere offered to the AVallenberg administration.Discussing these questions with Sir E, Howard on 21st April, Admiral Lindman stated that Sweden is in no immediate danger of starvation, the present stocks being sufficient to last till 25th September; nevertheless, lie declared that the British Governments offer to purchase the detained and possibly deteriorating grain cargoes at their market value would not compensate Sweden for the non-release of the ships. The Kogrund Channel question remains under negotiation; the Minister for Foreign
Affairs declares that Sweden is threatened with reprisals by Germany in the Baltic if she gives way in the matter.An important speech delivered by the Prime Minister in the Lower Chamber on 21st April explained the country&apos;s position and policy as regards food stocks and rations; he declared that no more beef would be exported. The speech created a very good impression. A meeting of several thousand workmen, simultaneously held outside the Chamber, adopted a resolution in which, inter alia, the Government, was urged to come to an arrangement with England. Herr Branting addressed and reassured the crowd and received an ovation.From the ISth to the 22nd April hunger strikes or demonstrations took place in various parts of the country. There is a strong and increasing agitation in favour of the total prohibition of ail food exports.Sir E. Howard, commenting on Baron. AdelswarcPs recent speech in Parliament on this subject, expresses the opinion that the Swedish Government may soon be brought to accept the views of the Liberal majority, especially if these are reinforced by pressure from England and America. Pressure of this kind is now being applied to prevent the export of fish and fish products from Sweden to Germany. The Swedish Government having failed to observe their obligations under their agreement in regard to this matter, His Majesty&apos;s Government have given instructions to suspend -all shipments of petroleum to Sweden, &quot;and have requested the co-operation of the United States to make this policy effective. Similar &quot;action is being taken in Denmark.His Majesty&apos;s Minister reports that preparations are being made for a great Socialist demonstration on 1st May. Its chief object will be to urge the democratisa-tion of the Swedish Government and the abolition of plural voting. Herr Branting does not expect any serious disturbances ; nevertheless, there is considerable uneasiness in. Government circles, particularly in regard to the attitude of certain infantry regiments which are known to be thoroughly disaffected.Public opinion in Sweden is much exercised with regard, to the situation in Norway; it is particularly concerned about the proposal that Norwegian shipowners-should be allowed to arm their vessels, as it is feared that this would mean war between Norway and Germany, in which case Sweden would probably be obliged to side with Norway. This prospect, observes Sir E. Howard (24th April), is naturally unwelcome to the pro-German. Conservatives, and almost equally so to the. peace-at-any-price Socialists and Liberals.Mr. Lagercrantz. formerly Swedish Minister at Washington (pro-German in his sympathies) will start on a Special Mission to the United States on 3rd May. His purpose is to negotiate an agreement in regard to imports.NORWAY.In spite of the reassurances given by the Government, a minority of the Norwegian Parliament opposed the acceptance of Great Britain&apos;s proposals for the acquisition of Norwegian tonnage, on the ground that it might involve the country in war with Germany or create trouble with Sweden. The Governments resohition, leaving the matter to be arranged by the Shipowners&apos; Association, was carried, however, by 99 votes to 19, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir M. Findlay (21st April) that be regarded EnglancVs proposals as accepted in principle. The Swedish Government had been informed and had no objections to offer.DENMARK.Further developments of the situation brought about by the refusal of British importers to accept certain shipments of. Danish butter would appear to point to a temporary curtailment or cessation of that trade (vide Report No. 10). The Danish, exporters having complained that large accumulations of their butter (the total estimated at 180,000 casks) remained unsold in England, Sir R. Paget was informed by the Foreign Office on the 14th April that these accumulations, and the compara-tively low price offered for Danish butter, were due to large consignments of Colonial and Argentine butter having lately been received. With a view to relieving the situation, arrangements were made by the Food Controller to recpuisition 90,000 cwts. of Australian butter for storage purposes ; by this means it was hoped to create an immediate demand for the Danish article. Sir R. Paget Avas notified accordingly on the 19th; on the same day he was instructed to inform the Danish Minister for
Foreign Affairs that His Majesty&apos;s Government had noted with serious apprehension and dissatisfaction the apparent increases in the export of Danish butter and bacou to Germany.   On the 20th the &quot; Daily Mail&quot; published a report stating that the Food Controller was &quot;talcing stern steps to make the best use of . all available butter and &quot;margarine;  that stocks were running short, and prices rising;   Danish butter &quot; coming in slowly because of shipping difficulties,&quot; &amp;c.   On the 21st, the Danish exporters renewed their complaint that only three-elevenths of their consignments of butter had been sold in England since the  blockade  began.    Certain shippers, suggested that the British Government should guarantee a fixed minimum price or allow an increased export to Sweden and Norway.    On the  23rd, Mr. Anderson informed Sir R. Paget that he was endeavouring to get all export of butter stopped,, with the exception of a small amount to Sweden.SPAIN.The resignation of Count Romanones and his Ministry took effect on the 19th April. The complexion of &quot;the new Ministry under Sehor Garcia Prieto is not pro-Ally. Count Romanones informed Mr. Vaughan. on the 20th that the original Note to Germany, drawn up by himself on 13th April, called for the severance of diplomatic relations, but he was over-ruled by the Prime Minister and Sehor Yillanueva ; the amended &quot;Note was drafted by Senor Alba, Minister of Finance. In the opinion of Mr. Vaughan, the crisis was more or less arranged. The Spaniards, believe that a rupture of relations must mean war ; they cling to their neutrality aud to the idea that Spain, as the most important non-combatant Power, may play an. important part at the Peace Conference. The Spanish Press announces that the Note was delivered in Berlin on the 22nd, but that, as it may hereafter form the basis of negotiations, it will not be published.In spite of the guarantees given to Spain on the subject of coal under the Cortina agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government have been surprised to learn that British, ore-ships continue to be detained in Spanish ports under the decree of 25th March. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Madrid reported that the Spanish Governments arbitrary proceedings were due to the Minister of Finance, who flatly refused to issue general instructions for the release of these vessels pending ratification of the Cortina agreement. Piis Majesty&apos;s Government, in reply, directed Mr. A7aughan to state that if the Spanish Government were not satisfied with the Cortina agreement, they should say so at once ; the whole position would then be reconsidered. As a precautionary measure and with a view to bringing new pressure to bear, Sir C. Spring Rice was requested.. (20th April) to invite the co-operation of the United States Government to induce the Spaniards to adopt a more friendly attitude, by-hinting that they might have difficulty hereafter in obtaining coal and corn from America.PORTUGAL.Sir L. Carnegie reported on 21st April that the Government had resigned as the result, of an adverse vote by the Chamber. The formation of a New Ministry was necessarily7 postponed pending the return of the Minister of Finance from Paris.Sir L. Carnegie has&quot; been instructed (24th April) to inform the Portuguese Govern-ment that His Majesty&quot;s Government greatly regret their inability to provide escort for further contingents of Portuguese troops. This decision is based, quite apart from the provision of transport tonnage required, on the Ad.m.admiralty&apos;s report that to provide such escort would further impair the already  inadequate protection available for transport and hospital ships in home waters and the Mediterranean His Majesty.&apos;s Minister has been confidentially7 informed that, in the opinion of the Admiralty, lack of efficiency7 and organisation have prevented the Portuguese Government from making-proper use of the facilities already offered.CHINA.Ss The United States Minister at Peking has informed Mr. Alston that he has been urging the Chinese Government to declare themselves belligerents on the side of the Allies without bargaining and trusting to the good faith of the Powers. His chief object is evidently to prevent China from becoming entirely7 dependent upon Japan.On further consideration of the assurances given by Lord Grey to the Marquis Inouye  in  January-  and.  February .1.916 (vide last Report),  with  regard to  the-
concessions enjoyed by Germany in China, His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion, that Great Britain is pledged to stand aside as regards their eventual disposal. While communicating this conclusion to Mr. Alston, 23rd April, the Foreign Office pointed out, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government are in no sense committed to supporting Japan&apos;s claims to reversionary rights in these concessions as against other Powers.JAPAN.The enemy trading ordinance was signed and passed for publication on the 18th of April.On .19th April Sir C. Greene made enquiry of the Minister for Foreign Affairs concerning the Japanese Governments policy and proposals in the matter of concerted action by the Allies at Bekiug, on which subject he had addressed a communication to the Japanese Foreign Office on 7th April. His Excellency replied that he was awaiting reports from Ministers of Commerce and Finance on the subject of the proposed increase in the Chinese tariff. For the rest, he thought it would be wiser for the Allies to niark time and not to state their terms to the Chinese&quot; at present. Sir C. Greene is of opinion that the Governments chief reason, for delay has lain in the fact that their fate depended upon the impending elections. The first results of these, published on 22nd of April, showed that the Governments majority was assured. On the following day Sir C. Greene reported that, on the practically complete results, the Terauchi Cabinet should be fairly secure against opposition attacks. The balance of power rests with the Independent members, who are friendly to the Ministry.SI AM. -As the result of representations addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by His Majesty&apos;s representative at Bangkok, the Siamese Government have agreed to publish the official protests which the)- addressed in March to Austria and Germany respecting their declarations of intensified submarine warfare. The fact that these protests had been withheld from publication was calculated to he useful to German propagandists, more especially as Slants declaration of neutrality, with respect to the United States and Germany, has been duly published.ARGENTINA.The complete returns compiled under the instructions of the Argentine Govern-ment show that the maximum export of wheat that can safely be conceded will not exceed 40 per cent, of all purchases made before 26th March. The Minister of Agriculture has agreed to an immediate export of 180,000 tors on account of the British Government, on condition that 20,000 tons of flour are taken at. the same time as a sop to the milling interests, This exceptionally favourable treatment is conceded as the result of Great Britain&apos;s offer to replace this wheat by Australian hereafter, in case of necessity.Sir R. Tower reported on 20th April that the machinery of several German and Austrian steamers had been damaged by their crews. Armed guards have now been placed on.board these vessels to prevent their being sunk.BRAZIL.Sir A. Peel reports that the Minister for Foreign Affairs finds himself in a difficult, position. On the one hand he has alienated his German supporters in his native State of Santa Catharina by severing relations with Germany ; on the other he is exposed to attacks by the Press on account of his German extraction. His recent policy having been consistently and energetically friendly to the cause of the Allies, and particularly favourable to Great Britain, Sir R. Peel recommends that he should now receive support in the form of an expression of His Majesty&apos;s Governments appreciation of his attitude of strict neutrality during the war.By breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany close upon the United States&apos; declaration of Avar, the Brazilian Government purposely avoided any declaration of neutrality, and are thus able to maintain normal relations with the United States, and to enable American Avarships to coal and repair in Brazilian ports. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has confidentially informed Sir A. Peel that he hopes to he able before long to afford similar facilities to the. Allies. -2S42 1 I)
, -     , . -    CHILE. -    &apos;      &apos; -&apos; !&apos;&apos;!&apos;!- Evidence has been obtained, and communicated by the Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Santiago, of enemy correspondence having been transmitted through Chilean official channels. Intercepted letters prove that the Bank fur Chile und Deutschlaiid of Hamburg has directed its Chilean branches to endeavour to obtain from the Chilean Government, facilities similar to those granted to the Banco Aleman Transatlantico for the transfer of funds to Germany through the ..Treasury of the Chilean Government in London and the Chilean Legation at the Hague. Sir F. Stronge has been instructed to request the Chilean Government to make immediate -enquiries into the matter. At the same time, the Chilean Minister in London has been informed that, failing the receipt of satisfactory assurances. His Majesty&apos;s Government will be reluctantly compelled to restrict the postal and telegraphic privileges accorded to his Legation.PERU.The Peruvian Government have sent a stereotyped reply to the Brazilian Govern-ments notification of rupture of relations with Germany, taking due note of this , important step and conveying an expression of affectionate sympathy.   His Majesty&apos;s. representative at Lima reports that the Brazilian Minister is far from satisfied with this reply, which is also likely to lie severely criticised in Peru.URUGUAY.According to information received by His Majesty&apos;s Minister, the engines of /German ships at Montevideo were destroyed on 14th April.&apos;    BOLIVIA.A safe conduct has been issued by the British Minister at La Paz to the German Minister and his Secretary to return to Germany via Buenos Aires. The German &apos; Minister is leaving his archives at Santiago (Chile), and will travel by rail to avoid risk of examination at sea.The Chilean Government have declined Germany&apos;s request to take charge of German interests in Bolivia.. . MEXICO.Mr. Thurstan was instructed on the 23rd April to lodge a formal protest against the seizure of the Mexican Railway. With regard to-the general situation arising out of Sefior Carranza&apos;s calculated hostility to Great Britain, His Majesty&apos;s Government expressed the opinion that for the present little can be done beyond reserving British rights in firm but courteous language. Mr. Thurstan was instructed accordingly and directed to keep in close touch with the United States Ambassador. He reported that the pro-German sympathies of the military party and politicians in Mexico were unmistakably manifested at the opening of Congress, when the German Minister-received an ovation (doubtless arranged) in the Chamber and from the crowd outside. Sehor Carranza succeeded in sowing discord among his numerous opponents in the Chamber, which broke up in disorder.Mr. Thurstan also observed that the hesitation which continued to mark the policy of the United States in Mexico was, in his opinion, fatal. On 18th April Sehor Carranza issued a decree imposing very high export duties on petroleum. On the same day, referring to the various measures suggested for ensuring the safety Of the oil-fields, Mr. Thurstan expressed the opinion that, to do so effectively, the United States must officially abaudou their support of Carranza. Sir C. Spring Rice reported (21st April) that, in the opinion of President Wilson, any overt act by-the American Government would precipitate a crisis in Mexico and should therefore [be avoided, the-more so as the United States have no forces available at the moment. The State Department are not-prepared to abandon Carranza until his attitude is clearly defined ; in any case, they do not wish to take any initiative, but to let the offence come from his side in an unmistakable form. -Sefior Carranza, for his part, has no hesitation in displaying truculent hostility. On ithe 21st, the Tehuantepec, Alvarado, and Yera Cruz Railways were seized by his orders, ostensibly for the
purpose of suppressing bandits. Two days before, the Press announced that he had ordered tbe confiscation of millions of acres of land in Lower California. The new Constitutionls calculated, in Mr. Thurstan&apos;s opinion, to create serious labour troubles affecting the mining industry, which are not likely to be lessened by the fact that SeQor Carranza has directed all Governors of States to comply with the workmen&apos;s . demands.Returning on the 25th to the question of British and American policy, Mr. Thurstan respectfully emphasises the need of a resolute attitude. A telegram from Sir C. Spring Rice of the same date indicates a disposition on the part of the State department t-roent to adopt, this view ; the American Ambassador in Mexico has been directed to advise further in tbe matter. Mr. Thurstan fears that his American colleague is. inclined to take undue comfort from soft words, of which the Mexicans are ever profuse. He suggests that his own departure upon leave would disconcert *he Mexican Government, and that the United States Ambassador considers his presence at Washington would be useful. In any case, an unhesitating policy of firmness is essential; without it he foresees that Mexico may become a second Greece.Senor Carranza&apos;s credentials as President were to be submitted to Congress between the 24-th and 20th April. In this connection the French Government have inquired whether, before recoguising him as President, the British Government intend to protest against the new Mexican Constitution or to make conditions as to its application.   The matter is under discussion at Washington.CUBA.A fresh outbreak of insurrection has occurred in Oriente Province, and seems to be gaining headway. Mr. Leech therefore requests that the proposed complimentary visit of a British cruiser be cancelled. The rebels have looted a Canadian settlement; more serious still, a number of British subjects&apos; (Jamaicans) have been shot by Government troops under apparently unjustifiable circumstances.The Cuban Government have seized five German steamers (all more or less damaged) and have interned their crews.COSTA RICA.Replying to the British Governments suggestion that President Tinoco should be simultaneously recognised by the United States and Great Britain, the State Depart-ment have informed Sir 0. Spring Rice that they are not yet prepared to recognise the new Government. Sir C. Mallet (Panama) reports, however, that the American. Minister to Costa Rica is now,on his way to Washington, and that he is confident that the United States Government will have to recognise Senor Tinoco&apos;s administration.UNITED STATES.  ,On the 18th April, Sir C. Spring Rice advised the Foreign Office that it would facilitate matters if the British Government would forthwith suspend the application of bunkering conditions in. the case of United States ships trading with South America, leaving the American authorities to handle the matter themselves and to take all necessary measures to prevent supplies or assistance from reaching enemy interests. Similarly, on the 21st, lie urged that the time has come for the with-clrawal of the statutory and confidential black lists affecting the United States ; failure to withdraw them has already caused considerable embarrassinent to the State Department, which claims that the United States Government are entitled to deal with these matters in the common, cause.The President of the Shipping Board continues to refuse his consent to the chartering of American ships for Allied service until the bunkering conditions are suspended. As the result of criticism brought to bear on this official from several quarters, he has now, however, been led to recognise the necessity for more cordial relations between himself and the representatives of the Allies and has now expressed his desire to work for the common cause.The French Ambassador at Washington, under instructions of his Government, has invited the co-operation of the United States Government in certain blockade2842-4 E
measures. Having regard to the nature of the measures proposed Sir C. Spring Rice has been directed to invite his colleague to keep in close touch in all such matters. The instructions given to the French Ambassador, involving the wholesale prohibition of foodstuff exports, seem to His Majesty&apos;s Government to recprire further and careful consideration, as their sudden application might have dangerous consequences. For the present, and. for specific reasons stated, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has been instructed to suggest to the State Department the advisability of prohibiting exports of fodder to Denmark and of coal to Spain.It is expected that Congress will authorise the President to requisition the german ships for use during tire war.: The State Department have informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that the United States Government will contest the condemnation of the three Wagner (American-Transatlantic line) ships by the British Prize Court, on the ground, that the vessels are American. Sir C. Spring Rice is of opinion that, in order to avoid irritation and misunderstanding, some means should be found of effecting a politic settlement of. the case without resort to condemnation of the ships, and he suggests a course of action calculated to attain that end.A Labour Delegation to the; United States sailed from Liverpool by the &quot; Orduna,&quot; on 23rd April. The three delegates selected were. Mr. Bowerman, M.P., Mr. Thomas, M.P., and. Mr. Carrod, of the Welfare Department of the Ministry of Munitions.GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.The State Department at Washington have requested His .Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to enquire whether anything can be done to relieve the congestion of cargo for shipment at New Orleans, where 30.000 tons of goods for Denmark and Sweden are awaiting tonnage. The freight contracts in respect to this cargo were made before the issue of the British Government^ regulations in regard to navicerts. - The British Governments proposals for,the acquisition, of Norwegian tonnage were referred to a secret session of the Norwegian. Parliament. . Sir M. Finlay understands that they met with some opposition from the Right, on the ground that if the Government give their consent to British requisitioning of/Norwegian ships, it will, be construed as a casus belli by Germany, and the Government would therefore be better advised to arm their own ships and face the consequences. With a view to -securing the shipping required, and conditionally thereon, Mis -Majesty&apos;s Minister has been authorised to promise the Norwegian Government 20 aeroplanes for use against&quot;Zeppelins and 9 mobile anti-aircraft guns.   Fully equipped crews for the aeroplanes&apos; would be sent, whenever required, to provide against German attacks.Sir M. Finlay has again drawn attention to the need for Admiralty sailing Instructions to lie given by competent authority to Norwegian, shipmasters leaving British ports on their return voyage.The adoption of a new and more protected route has now been sanctioned for traffic between Great Britain and Denmark, via Lerwick and the inner Moray Firth.. This route, protected by patrols, necessitates the acceptance by shipowners and: masters of a.journey considerably longer than the old direct route, besides frequent delays&apos; dire to&apos;unavoidable precautionary measures.C , The Danish Government have entered a strong protest at Berlin against the sinking of the two produce, boats &quot; Saxo&quot; and &quot;Nancy,&quot; torpedoed outside the proclaimed clanger zone. Sir R. Paget has been instructed to press the Danish Government to effect a reduction in the amount of. produce sent to Germany equivalent to the cargoes thus lost The Minister for Foreign Affairs considers that -this would be umvise ;. the result would probably be that Germany would, proceed to&apos; sink produce floats between Denmark and Norway. lie mentioned that the Germans were sinking boats outside the danger zone because the fatter is so well patrolled that their submarines are compelled to avoid it.&apos; :    The Danish Press continues to denounce Germany&apos;s submarine warfare.   Under\ instructions from the Chancellor, the German Minister at Copenhagen., on the point of leaving for Berlin, called on Mr. Andersen to discuss the attitude of the Press; he-was told that its denunciations of. Germany&apos;s barbarous methods conveyed but. mildly the feelings of the Danish people. The Press states that &apos;Germany&apos;s Ministers in neutral countries have been summoned to Berlin for a conference on the results,&apos; political and economic, of the.submarine campaign.
The Governor-General of Canada and the Governor of Newfoundland have been notified by the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the risks for sailing ships in European waters are too great to permit of their employment in the home trade and steps are therefore being taken to license them only for voyages outside the danger zone. The Shipping Controller hopes that the Canadian and Newfoundland Governments will adopt the same policy.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.According to a telegram from Camille Huysmans published in the &quot; Social Democraten &quot; at Stockholm on the 18th April, the Internationalist Socialist Executive Committee have decided to hold an. International Conference at Stockholm in support of the views of Kerenski and President Wilson. The other Conference which is being organised by Lenin, for the purpose of securing a separate Russian-German peace,) is in opposition to the International Conference. Mr. Branting welcomes the action of the International. Mr. Stauning, the Danish Socialist Minister, believes that it can confidently reckon on securing representation from all countries.GENERAL.Diplomatic relations between Turkey and the United States were broken off by the Turkish Embassy at Washington on the 23rd April. The Netherlands Government have now undertaken the charge of British, interests in Turkey and Bulgaria.   The latter&apos;country has not yet severed relations at Washington.In order to reciprocate the marked courtesy shown by the Austrian Government to United States officials and to demonstrate sympathy with the Austrians in their troubles with Berlin, the State Department have expressed to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment the hope that all possible consideration may be shown to the Austrian Ambassador and his Staff on their voyage to Europe.On 21st April His Majesty&apos;s Government instructed Sir W. Townley to request the Dutch Government to communicate to Berlin certain proposals for the con-clusion. of an agreement, whereby those British and German officers and men who have been prisoners for two years and upwards should be transferred to a neutral country, under conditions similar to those now obtaining in the case of invalid prisoners or -war interned in Switzerland. It is proposed that the agreement shall be applied, man. for man, to prisoners selected strictly in sequence according to dates of capture, until either all have thus been transferred or no more accommodation is available.No reply having been received to the enquiries which Sir W. Townley was directed to make (vide last Report) concerning the German Governments stoppage of parcels for British prisoners of war, he has now been instructed to request the Dutch Government to renew these enquiries and, as the matter is of vital importance, to ask for an answer within a week.A large quantity of German correspondence has been discovered concealed under bacon ami. apples in a box and four barrels shipped abroad on a Norwegian sailing ship which left Baltimore on 25th February.After full consideration, the scheme for bringing Schleswig deserters to labour on the land, in Great Britain has been abandoned, its risks being out of proportion to its possible advantages.Acting upon the representations of the Army Council, His Majesty&apos;s Government have instructed Sir W*. Towuley and Sir R. Paget to inform the Netherlands Overseas Trust and. the Danish Associations respectively that, in the present state of the war, it has become necessary to revoke the arrangement by which they enjoyed, free passage of telegrams with complete immunity from censorship. Such immunity cannot be guaranteed for the future, but His Majesty&apos;s Government will appreciate the continued co-operation of the Trust, and Associations in the work of supervision, and all messages sent through them will continue to receive favourable treatment.
