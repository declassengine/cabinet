APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED   WESTERN  AND (GENERAL.,jjs i^Kyji&quot;:&quot;Tii rU? ueport,  T!2pT!Tfr tv&quot;i^v-^sf^v,-tv3jotJi&apos;tV^ociV^ij .^0Canada.The coascription issue bids fair to involve as complete a rearrangement, of political parties in Canada as in Australia. The danger in. Canada lies in the divergence between English arid French speaking Canada which this rearrangement may increasingly accentuate. A summary of the political effect of the conscription issue in Canada and the other Dominions will be found in the Appendix.New Zealand.The very strongly worded telegram from the New Zealand Government with regard to the German Colonies in the Pacific deserves serious consideration. After all, the views upon these issues of our own Dominions are of much greater permanent importance than those of any ephemeral collection of cranks in Russia. It may be important to humour the &quot; Soviet,&quot; but not at the cost of lasting estrangement between the Imperial Government and the Dominions.FliANCE.For the moment the complete success of the French policy in Greece has, no doubt, greatly strengthened the prestige of the French Government at home, already enhanced by M. Ribot&apos;s firm attitude with regard to Alsace-Lorraine, and will help to sustain the courage of the French people through a difficult period.Italy.The Ministerial crisis, nominally over the proclamation of the Albanian Protectorate, seems to have been in some&apos;measure a revolt against Baron Sonnino&apos;s autocratic methods within the Cabinet. The adjustment of the difficulty is probably only temporary. Meanwhile Anglo-French action in Greece has not diminished Baron Sonnino&apos;s difficulties. Its very success will naturally increase Italian jealousy of French influence in this region.Greece.The French policy of prompt action with an overwhelming display of force to back it up has, apparently&apos;-, scored a complete success. Whether all possibility of trouble is over remains to be seen. No news has yet been received as to the attitude of the Greek Army in the Morea. Meanwhile the absence of any effort at resistance in Thessaly or at Athens would suggest that the Greek Army leaders have been unable to secure any promise of early military support from Germany.The effect upon Russia of the Allied coups in Greece and Albania is not easy to predict The fact that, our action in Greece was taken against a monarch may- be useful, but the Germans will certainly lose no time in circulating their version of Greek affairs.   M. Terestchenko is obviously upset by Italy &quot;s action in Albania.
Spain.The internal crisis is becoming increasingly serious. The exact scope and purpose of. the movement initiated by the Officers&apos; Committees is not clear. It may be purely a protest against mismanagement and favouritism in tfie Army administration, but the danger of its being complicated by the political struggle between the Royalist and revolutionary sections is always present. The Allied cause in Spain has, for the moment, suffered considerably by being identified with Senor Lerroux and the anti-dynastic sentiments of the recent great meeting in the Madrid Bull Ring. - Recent events have also re-awakened the deep-seated Spanish jealousy of French Republicanism.Beace Discussions.While the Governments of the Central Bowers are labouring away at the consolidation of Middle Europe, in. spite of the difficulty of finding a Hungarian Premier acceptable to Count Tisza, and of bitches in the tariff negotiations, Germany&apos;s more particularist interests as a Colonial Power have again been brought into prominence by Dr. solf&apos;s speech to the German Colonial Association. But in spite of these and other much more ambitious demands in the Press for a Colonial Empire after the war, it would be a mistake to imagine that Germany regards the Colonial question as possessing anything like the same importance as the Middle European question. Middle Europe is now the foundation of German policy; Belgium, Colonies, trade facilities after the war, these are the extras for which Germany will fight and bargain, but which are not in the same sense fundamental issues.L.

PART I. BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.Ia response to the invitation of the British Government to nominate a representative to confer with the Board of Trade upon the matter of the Empire becoming self-, sufficing in meat supplies,1 the Union of South Africa have appointed their High Commissioner for the purpose.In reply to the enquiry of the Australian Commonwealth as to the functions of the proposed Committee to deal with the control of wool production, and the repre-sentation to be accorded to each country,2 the Secretary of State has explained that the Resolution proposed at the Imperial Conference aimed at securing the wool requirements of the British Empire and Allies for the period immediately following the war, without restricting the market for wool producers within the Empire. Representation on the Committee will be given to the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, but the total number of members and the representation of the United Kingdom are matters which have not yet been fixed. There would, however, it, is remarked, be no objection to the Dominion Governments appointing more than one representative, and the New Zealand Government has, in fact, named a second representative in case he should be required.GENERAL.In pursuance of the arrangements for the requisitioning of ships,3 the Governments of the Dominions have been informed of the terms of the Defence of the Realm Regulation which it is proposed to issue. This lays clown that an application for the transfer of the registry of a British vessel from a port of registry in the United Kingdom to a port of registry outside that country shall not be made without the consent of the Board of Trade. The Dominion Governments have been asked to notify accordingly the Registrars of Shipping at British oversea ports.The New Zealand Government have agreed, to the policy proposed in relation to trading with Japan.3CANADA.The Bill providing for compulsory Military Service was introduced into the Dominion House of Commons by the Prime Minister on 11th June, according to Press reports.   Further reference is made to this matter in the Appendix to this Report.To ensure the provision of $25,000,000 per month for the Imperial Munitions Board during the next three months,4 the Dominion Minister of Finance has made arrange-ments for a loan of 875,000,000 from the Banks. Lord Cunliffe has expressed a favourable view upon the practicability of issuing Dominion notes against South African gold,4 the gold to be held for the Canadian Government in South Africa, and the Minister would issue $50,000,000 in this way. Sir Thomas White desires, however, that the issue might be held over till the autumn on account of tne financial operations connected with the crops at that time.As His Majesty the King has approved of the Imperial Silver War Badge being issued to all soldiers who have served since 4th August 1914 and who have been discharged through old age, wounds or sickness, it does not seem possible to the Army Council to agree to the suggestion to limit the issue of these badges to members of the Canadian forces who have served in England or at the front.1 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 2nd May and 6th June 1917. 2 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 23rd May and 6th June 1917. 3 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 30th May and 6th June 1917. 4 See Western and General Report for week ending 6th June 1917.
With reference to the enquiry of the Admiralty as to the possibility of building 24 more trawlers in Canadian yards1, further, investigation has been made by the Minister of Naval Service. As a result of this, he states that if the order for this number of trawlers were given at once, they could be delivered in 1918, at the time when the St. Lawrence is opened for navigation.AUSTRALIAN COMMON WEALTH.With regard to the desire of New South Wales to offer their aviation pilots to the War Office, the Commonwealth Government have pointed out that a matter of this character should be conducted through the Commonwealth authorities and not through the State Government direct.It has been decided to extend licences for the importation of Australian wine up to a limit of 50 per cent, of the average imports in the years 19.11, 1912, and 1913.The British Government have conveyed their thanks to the Commonwealth Government for their prompt action in regard to the tea supplies from India and Ceylon.1NEW ZEALAND.An important telegram has been received from the New Zealand Government regarding the disposition of German territory in the Pacific,2 which is a matter the Ministers regard with the gravest concern. After calling attention to the occupation of Samoa by troops of the Dominion and the capture of other territory in the Pacific by Australia, the New Zealand Government declare that they cannot consent to the restoration of these lands to Germany. Such a course, they point out, wotdd establish a constant menace to peace and trade, which would involve unnecessary future sacrifices. The British people in the Dominion cannot, moreover, abandon the natives in Samoa, who are so closely connected with the Maori both by descent and language. As Parliament is elected by universal suffrage and party politics have been obliterated during the war, the decision of the National Government conveyed in the above message represents, it is stated, the will of a democratic people who desire peace only on terms which afford protection to their future freedom.With regard to suggestions which have at different times reached New Zealand as to additional reinforcements, the Government of the Dominion are somewhat puzzled. They call attention to the fact that their position was indicated in a telegram of 15th Eebruary,3 and that New Zealand has not failed to supply the reinforcements agreed upon. While the Dominion Government never wished for the formation of an additional Brigade, they agreed to the suggestion on the understanding that additional reinforcements should not be demanded, and that the supply of reinforcements to the original Division should not be prejudiced. The Government cannot change this policy, and they do not think Parliament would be in the least likely to support them in doing so unless Mr. Massey, on his return, were able to say that an early termination of the war was certain, and success rested upon each Dominion sending increased reinforcements. If present reiuforcements are not sufficient, the Government recommend that the new fourth Brigade be re-absorbed, into the New Zealand Division. It is added that the departures of the New- Zealand transports during recent months will, show that the desire of the British Government to hasten the supply of reinforcements has been met by the Dominion Government.The New Zealand Government were informed by telegram of 4th June that six Mormon missionaries, desiring to leave the United States for the Dominion on 6th June, applied for the necessary visa, and the agreement of the Government was sought to this course. In reply the Governor telegraphed direct to the British Ambassador at Washington stating that the New Zealand Government do not desire the missionaries to visit the Dominion at present. It has been arranged that future applications of a similar nature shall also be referred to the New Zealand Ministers.1 See Western and General Report for week ending 30th May 1917.2 See also Appendix to Western and General report for week ending 6th June 1917.3 See Western and General Report for week ending 21st February 1917.
SOUTH AFRICA.With reference to the urgent telegram of the Union Government concerning the purchase of the surplus crop of maize1, the British Government have agreed to buy the exportable surplus of the maize crop in spite of the difficulties regarding freight. The British authorities will continue to purchase from the merchants but will leave the Union Ministers to deal with the prices to farmers.In forming their estimates of the cost of various services some four months ago, the Union Ministers point out that they then anticipated that the campaign in East Africa would speedily terminate. As it happens, however, further units have been formed (both for East Africa and oversea) and the lengthening of the campaign increases the cost in respect of pay, hospital accommodation, &amp;c. Ministers there-fore have with regret been forced to limit the amount of assistance for 1917-1 8 to 1,000,000Z. A further .1,272,500Z. will be provided to meet (1) the excess of Union over Imperial rates of pay for all men of the South African Forces on Imperial service in Central and East Africa, and (2) some of the general cost of Union contingents on Imperial service in the Union.It is anticipated that, owing to the interference with building work on account of the war, about 500 skilled men from the building trades might be recruited in the Union for work in Great Britain connected with munition works, camps, &amp;c. It is expected that free transport, both to the United Kingdom and back to South Africa at the end of the service, should be provided, and an assurance given that the men would not be taken for military service without their agreement.PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.With regard to the native rising in the Barue region,2 it is reported that all the forces operating against the rebels have been successful. The rebels have lost many killed and wounded and about 500 prisoners, and the Governor-General anticipates that the revolt will shortly be at an end.The Acting Consul-General at Lorenzo Marques stated (6th June) that the strike of Bortuguese railway employees had spread to those employed on tramways and public vehicles! Martial law had been declared, but no disturbances had yet occurred. A later telegram (10th June) indicates some improvement and that about 10 per cent, of men are working under military law.Owing to the serious shortage of coal, the Acting Consul-General was requested to see if the South African Government would send coal trains to Lorenzo Marques, but it appears that the South African railways cannot assist at present.The British Minister at Lisbon has been instructed to urge upon the Portuguese Government the necessity of sending immediate instructions regarding the recruiting of carriers in Portuguese East Africa.GERMAN EAST AFRICA.The Administrator reports that he has heard from the military authorities that the enemjr, consisting of 40 Europeans and 400 natives with 10 machine guns, crossed the Central Railway near Tabora on 31st May and proceeded north-east.It was further reported by delayed telegram that Singidda was occupied by the enemy on 3rd June.GOLD COAST.The Governor states that there are 2,068 troops in the Colony, but that there is an urgent need for officers. Reinforcements in this regard are essential in order to provide for the adequate training of the men.1 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 9th and 23rd May and 6th June 1917. 2 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 11 th and 18th April 1917. 3209-2 B
LIBERIA.The Liberian Government, have asked that Great Britain, France and the United States will make provision, in the terms of peace with Germany, for the protection of Liberia against German aggression after the war, and that on the departure from Liberia of all German subjects the restrictions now placed on Liberian trade with Great Britain and her Allies be at once removed, and every facility given to Liberia to develop her trade with those countries. On the completion of an understanding in the above direction, Liberia will take immediate measures, in conjunction with the naval representatives of the Allies, regarding the removal of the Germans in the country and. their internment in France. Being in an anxious state of suspense, the Liberians look to England for relief.CYPRUS.In contemplation of an. aerial bombardment of the island of Ruacl (for which, the Turks are said to have taken aeroplanes to Beyrout) the French are urgently desirous of evacuating the population of about 1,300, and enquiries are being made as to whether a refugee camp could be established in Cyprus in order to accommodate these people.The Governor of Cyprus in. reply has stated that he will be glad, to give all help possible towards the establishment of a refugee camp, and he is so informing the Governor of Ruacl.CEYLON.The Governor reports that he has received from a Sinhalese gentleman, who desires to be anonymous, a cheque for 2,500Z. for the purchase of a seaplane. This sum is therefore being paid over to the British Government.
part ii.-foreign affairs.ALLIED COMMON AFFAIRS.Towards the end of May proposals were mooted, and conveyed to Baron Sonnino by the French and British Ambassadors at Rome, that His Majesty the King of Italy should meet His Majesty King George and the French President in France, with a view to a general discussion of the situation. It was felt by the British and French Governments that the new conditions which had arisen in Russia, together with the situation in Greece, made it desirable that a conference should take place betAveen the Heads of the Allied States. From the outset, however, Baron Sonnino was decidedly opposed to the idea. He held that recent events in Russia, the possibly impending deposition of the King of Greece, and the anti-monarchical spirit prevalent in many quarters, all combined to make the moment inopportune for the proposed meeting. Be Avas convinced that its object would be widely mis-interpreted, especially in Russia, and that in the end it avouIcI seiwe the purposes of Germany. Negotiations on the subject continued until 6th June, when, in consideration of Baron Sonnino&apos;s unshaken opposition, it Avas decided not to press the invitation further, and by common consent all public reference to the matter avas avoided. Baron Sonnino in the end wished it to be understood that, in his opinion, the proposed conference Avas not undesirable, but only the moment inopportune ; if held uoav, it might lead to a Aveakening of the monarchy in Italy, which would, mean a Aveakening of the country&apos;s military strength. He thought it unwise that occasion should be given for attributing to the Monarchs any responsibilities properly attaching to Ministers. Accepting this view of the matter, and being still of opinion that a conference is urgently desirable, in Avhich Italy &quot;would be informed and consulted upon matters affecting the Allied cause, the British and French Governments are inviting the Italian Government to send representatives to meet Ministers of France aud Great Britain at some French town near the Italian frontier, or in England if they prefer it. The question of Russian represen-tation at the Conference has been mooted. The Russian Minister for Foreign. Affairs has informed Sir G. Buchanan (12th June) that the proceedings of France in Greece and of Italy in Albania have given the Provisional Government much cause for anxiety ; they consider that a Conference is highly necessary to restore solidarity betaveen the Allies.Lord Bertie reported on 6th June that the British, French, and Italian delegates at the Silk Conference in Paris had arrived at the main lines of an agreement, by virtue of Avhich the export of all undyed thrown silk from Italy Avould be prohibited, and the Swiss ration for home requirements fixed at about 15,000 quintals. In return, the Allies Avould agree to buy the unexported stock of native Italian thrown silk through a Joint Purchasing Commission at Lyons. Great BritaiiPs share of this purchasing liability will amount to about 11 millions of francs, assuming that the United States participate. It is also proposed to prohibit the export from switzerland of articles made from raw materials imported from Allied countries. As these negotiations will invoLTe certain modifications of the existing Swiss agreement, it has become necessary to invite the Federal Government to send delegates to the Conference. This has been clone by the French Government, and the Swiss repre-sentative left Berne for Paris on the 12th dune. Meanwhile the British delegates, having come to a satisfactory arrangement on&apos; all the points in which Great Britain is directly involved, returned to London on the 10th.ITALY.  &quot;The Albanian question-has produced a Ministerial crisis at Rome ; three Ministers (Bissolati, Bonomi, and Commandini) tendered - their resignations (6th June) on the ground that the Protectorate proclamation had been issued on the individual authority of the President of the Council and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and without consulting the Ministry.   Sir R. Rodd stated on the 8th that the Albanian question
shad been used by the War Party as a pretext, more convenient than Parliamentary agitation, for bringing about a Ministerial crisis and for securing rearrangements calculated to produce more drastic measures against the Germans and a firmer internal policy. On the 9th it was reported that His Majesty the King had come to Rome and had seen Signor Bissolati. On the 10th Sir R. Rodd reported that (no doubt as the result of the King&apos;s intervention) the Ministerial crisis had been satisfactorily concluded.As regards the general war aims and common pun-poses of the Allies, Baron Sonnino informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador on 9th June that he would be glad if the situation might be so re-established as to permit of a satisfactory arrangement of the various questions at issue. He fully realised that the result of the revolution in Russia might necessitate a readjustment of claims and interests in various directions. At the same time he greatly desired that the actual position of affairs should be recorded in some definite form which would enable him to make a non-committal statement to the Chamber on its reassembling.BELGIUM.His Majesty&apos;s Government are unwilling to encourage the sending of supplies to Belgium -which serve to. replace those of which the Germans have robbed the Belgian people. Sir W. Townley has been directed to impress this attitude upon the Dutch - Authorities, with reference to the general question of Dutch foodstuffs for Belgian relief, and to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot agree to the Commission^ purchase of meat in Holland, until satisfied by reliable evidence that the Germans have desisted from seizing Belgian cattle for their own use.GREECE.M. Johnart reached Salamis Strait on the evening of 5th June. Sir F. Elliot saw him on the 6th; he proceeded to Salonika on that day without having landed at Athens. He took occasion en passant to hand to the French Minister, for transmission to M. Zaimis, a note informing him of the intention of the Allies to send troops into Thessaly for &quot;the purpose of securing- the crops. This note was subsequently withdrawn before presentation, M. Jonnart having decided to present his demands to M. Zaimis in person on his return from. Salonika.Under the French Governments scheme for purchasing and controlling the harvest in Thessaly (as laid down in a Memorandum communicated last month to the Foreign Office by M. -Cambon), it is proposed to eliminate the Government at Athens and the National Bank from all part in the operations. The buying of the crops will be entrusted to a mixed Commission, including representatives of the Ionian Bank, the Bank of Athens, and of Thessaliati landowners, besides British and French delegates. This Commission will be invested with full powers, and its object will be to Avork amicably with the landowners in the interests of the Allies. The French Government cite the success of the British harvest-buying operations in Roumania as a precedent that may well be applied in the present instance.According to information confidentially supplied, to Sir F. Elliot by his French colleague, M. Jonnart&apos;s original plan for securing the abdication of King Con-stantine was to deliver a 24 hours&apos; ultimatum to the Prime Minister on board of a French warship in Pirteus harbour and to occupy the piraeus by French troops during the night. In conversation with Sir F. Elliot on the 6th, M. Jonnart announced his intention, of broaching the question upon his return to Athens drom Salonika, on or about 11th June. He did not propose to raise it, however, until he had at hand a force sufficient to repress any disorder that might arise ; not being accredited to the King, he would convey his message through the Prime Minister. His Majesty and his entourage wottld be assured of their personal safety and considerate treatment.His Majesty&apos;s Government, feeling strongly that no military operations should be undertaken in Greece except in the very last resort, directed Mr. Grahame (in the-
absence of Lord Bertie) to protest most strongly to the French Government against any disembarkation of troops at the Piraeus, and to point out that the intentions of the French Government, as reported, involved a definite violation of the decisions recorded at the London Conference. It was therein laid down that any disembarkation that might be necessitated by a movement of Greek forces to resist the Allies in Thessaly, should take place at the Isthmus of Corinth. The resolutions of the Conference were expressly intended to -provide for a pacific solution of the Greek question ; in view of the respective attitudes of the Russian, Serbian and Italian Governments towards this question, any military action of a nature to precipitate a crisis and endanger the safety of the Legation at Athens must place Mis Majesty&apos;s Government in a very difficult position. Under these circumstances His Majestys Government urged that the French Government should now agree to press only for the withdrawal of Xing Constantine until the end of the Avar, with the appointment &apos; of one of his sons as Regent with a Venizelist Ministry.To this proposal the French Government declined to agree. M. Ribot, supported by the Ministers of War and Marine, declared to Mr. Grahame (Sth June) that to adopt such a solution at the present juncture Avould be construed as a sign of Aveakness. The language used by the Ministers of War and Marine was very determined. They recognised Russia&apos;s interest in the situation only in so far as to admit that a weakening of the Macedonian front might prejudice the impending Russian offensive. In their vieAv, Italian and Serbian opinion was apparently negligible. The Minister of War insisted that, provided action were taken by M. Jonnart with a sufficient show of force, the Royalist cause Avould collapse ; at the same time M. Ribot was sure that M. Jonnart would faithfully abide by the policy laid down at the London Conference. On receipt of Mr. Grahame&apos;s report (9th June) the Foreign Office directed him to address further urgent representations to the French Government and to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree to any modification of the Conference resolution, whereby it had been definitely decided that force Avas only to be used in the event of Royalist resistance in Thessaiy, and that Athens Avas to be dealt Avith if necessary, by an inten-sive blockade. On the same evening Sir F. HUiot visited M. Jonnart aboard the French flagship, on which he had just returned from Salonika. He announced his intention of presenting his demands to M. Zaimis on the eA^ening of the 10th; 1.0,000 men would be landed at the Piraeus that night and a regiment on the Isthmus of Corinth ; the advance into Thessaly would begin simultaneously. He believed that the best protec-tion against disorder and danger to the Allied and neutral Legations lay in the display of OArervvhelming force, an opinion in which Sir F. Elliot eventually concurred.The confidence of the French in the efficacy of a determined attitude was justified by events. The successive instructions sent to M. Jonnart by the French Government (according to assurances given by M. Ribot to Mr. Grahame on the 12th) were strictly based on the resolutions of the London Conference, but Mr. Grahame gathered that M. Jonnart had assumed a certain latitude in their local execution. As regards the King, M. Jonnart Avas authorised to accept his withdrawal in lieu of abdication, if the proposal were made to him ; he was not to work for the establishment of a Republic.The course of events, betAveen the presentation of the ultimatum by M. Jonnart on the morning of the 11th. and the King&apos;s abdication and. departure on the 12th, has been described in the Press. The landing of French troops at Corinth, and the occupation of the military posts in Thessaly7, Avere effected without incident. Three hours after the presentation of the ultimatum, M. Zaimis asked Sir F. Elliot whether, instead of abdicating, King Constautine might appoint one of his sons as Viceroy until the end of the Avar. His MajestVs Minister replied that the ultimatum Avas final, but expressed his personal belief that, if the Greek people wished it, and if the King did nothing meanwhile to irritate public opinion against him, he might be allowed. to resume the throne on the restoration of peace. M. Zaimis announced the King&apos;s Avish to go to Switzerland. It was arranged that he should embark Avith all possible privacy on a British ship sailing from Oropos for an Italian port. Prince AlexandePs succession Avas announced on the night of 11th June : he took the oath on the following afternoon. On the same day a small force of French troops was landed at the Piraeus ; M. Jonnart assured the Greek Government that they Avould not approach the city except in the event of disorder. King Constantine left Athens in the morning &quot;for Tatoi, there to await notice of the final arrangements for his embarkation. The Royal party consists of the ex-King and Queen, the Crown Prince, Prince Paul, and three Princesses, with a suit of IS ladies and gentlemen in waiting and 16 servants.   Sir F. Elliot reports3209-2c
that, under the terms of the ultimatum, it is proposed to grant King Constantine an allowance of 20.000Z. a year.The landing of a Senegalese contingent at Patras was countermanded on 10th June in deference to the urgent protest of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and M. Jonnart was instructed that these troops are not to be used in Greece except in case of urgent military necessity.At Salonika M. Jonnart informed Lord Granville and M. Venizelos that he had given very strict orders to General Sarrail to carry out the occupation of Thessaly in the most pacific manner possible&apos;; at the same time he thought the best means of avoiding bloodshed was to have sufficient forces at hand. To M. Venizelos he said that in the event of his return to power at Athens there must be no question of reprisals. M. Venizelos, according to Lord Granville, did not appear to be greatly elated by M. Jonnart&apos;s mission; he regarded the prospect of the Regency as a &quot; bastard &quot; solution, but agreed that everything possible should be done to avoid civil war. Lord Granville stated that, in discussing the future residence of King Constantine, M. Jonnart was in favour of his going to England in preference to Copenhagen. As regards the Regency, M. Venizelos advised M. Jonnart that he did not propose to join the Council at first ; he advised that it should be composed of men of well-known Royalist sympathies. M. Venizelos himself did not propose to go to Athens until the pro-German leaders had been removed.In reply to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s letter requesting that General Sarrail be recalled, M. Ribot deprecated precipitate a*ction in a matter which calls for deliberation. For political reasons explained, the French Government are unable to give immediate effect to this request (it would be impossible publicly7 to justify the proposed &quot; swapping of horses in mid-stream&quot;), but as soon as it can be done without risking the success of the measures now undertaken, General Sarrail will be transferred to another command. His M.ajesty&apos;s Government have expressed their gratification at &quot;this decision ; they have reason to believe that their request for his recall finds supporters with many sections of influential opinion in France, but that, owing to reasons of internal politics, the French Government cannot give effect to it at present. General Sarrail is backed by a strong Radical-Socialist group of politicians ; he is, in fact, the only General in whom the Republicans have absolute confidence because of his freedom from all taint of Conservative or Clerical ideas. Monsieur Pate (a possible aspirant to the Ministry of War) informed Mr. Grahame on 5th June that, &apos;if he were appointed to that office, lie would at once send for General Sarrail to advise and assist him. On the 8th. Monsieur Cambon expressed to Lord Robert Cecil his opinion that the recall of General Sarrail. would mean the fall of the Ministry.The occupation of Janina and other military activities of the Italians in Epirus, following close upon the Albanian proclamation, may undoubtedly be ascribed to distrust and dislike of General sarrail&apos;s subordination of military to political aims. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Janina reported (Cth June) that much resentment was felt by the Italians at the Franco-Venizelist occupation of Lefkas : their southward movement was definitely intended to head off the French from Preveza, which town was occupied by the Italians on the 9th. According to the same authority, the hungry population would wrelcome a Venizelist occupation supported by England or France. The Italians are only popular with the Royalist officials.Janina, evacuated by the Greek police and troops, was entered by an Italian force, on 8th June. Sir F. Elliot learns that M. Zaimis had asked for the Italian occupation in order to forestall the Venizelists. The situation thus created is evidently^ fraught with grave danger of leading to serious disputes between the French and Italian authorities on the spot. His Majesty&apos;? Ambassadors in Paris and Rome have been directed to draw the attention of the French and. Italian Governments to this state of affairs, and to suggest that, in the common, interests of the Allies, these conflicting aims and claims should be set aside until the end of the Avar. On the 12th, Sir R.&apos; Rodd telegraphed that Baron Sonnino had given categorical orders against anv southward movements.O    -.-   ....   yA telegram from the Italian Consul at Janina, received in Rome on the 12th, acknowledged the receipt of these instructions and contradicted the report of the occupation of Breveza. On the 11th His Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consul at Janina had reported, however, that the Italian forces had pushed eastwards and south and had occupied Metsovo and Philippiada without incident. A. deputation of the inhabitants proceeded to the British and Russian Consulates at Janina to express the popular desire for a mixed occupation.
ALBANIA.On 8th June Essad Pasha handed to Lord Granville a protest against the declaration of the Italian Protectorate, to which, he declared, the Albanians would never submit. On the same day His Majesty&apos;s Government were informed by Sir G. Buchanan that the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs had proposed that Great Britain, France and Russia should make a collective protest at Rome and decline to recognise the Italian Protectorate. On 7th June the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attention of the Italian Ambassador to the matter, emphasising the importance of pursuing a united policy in the Balkans. The Ambassador endeavoured to justify Baron Sonnino&apos;s action on the ground that Italy had been frequently ignored in regard to affairs in Greece In view of the ministerial crisis at Rome, Sir R. Rodd advised (7th June) that no formal protest be made to the Italian Govern-ment for the time being and that no hint of divided counsels should be made public. On the Oth, he informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he would defer discussion of the question until the difficulties of the Cabinet had been arranged. On the 10th, Baron Sonnino gave definite assurances to the French Ambassador that the Albanian question would be settled in accordance with the terms of the London agreement ; the proclamation was to be regarded as nothing more than &quot; a military episode.&quot; He explained to Sir R. Rodd that the Avord &quot;protection&quot; was to- be construed in the dictionary, and not in the diplomatic, sense.SERBIA.Sir C. des Graz reported on 8th June that by the judgment given in the Conspiracy Trial, eight of the accused officers had been condemned to death, and two (of whom one was General Popovitch) to terms of hard labour. The condemned have the right to appeal to the supreme Military Court.The q uestion of the removal of the Serbian seat of Government from Corfu is suspended, for the time being.GERMAN AFFAIRS.The newly elected President of the Parliament of Alsace-Lorraine, said, in the course of a speech which has been used for the purposes of the German wireless service, that &quot; the people of Alsace-Lorraine, by an overwhelming majority, &quot; never wished for war. What they desire is to build up their civic state as a part &quot; of the German Empire, and to be free to pursue the path of productive industry.&quot;The German Press reports an abnormal drought, especially in South Germany, which is seriously endangering the country&apos;s prospects of obtaining even an average harvest. On the other hand, the &quot; Vor warts &quot; and &quot; Der Tag&quot; announce that, owing to the large supplies of grain allotted to Germany from the Roumanian booty, the natiohs bread rations can easily be maintained as at present until the harvest has been garnered and victorious peace achieved.The action of. the Government, in permitting the widespread propagandist activities of the Pan-German annexationists, is severely criticised by a section of the Press. The &quot; Berliner Tageblatt,&quot; for example, points out that the authors of the Pan-German pamphlets (which have been distributed broadcast at the front to explain, the advantages of a &quot; German peace &quot;) overlook certain consequences of that kind of peace, which must weigh heavily with thoughtful men. This organ, greatly concerned with the restoration of Germany&apos;s position in the overseas trade7 markets, foresees that such a peace would restrict Germany indefinitely to &quot; the purely home limits within which, her commercial activities are at present confined.&quot;The &quot;Hamburger Nachrichten&quot; mentions the erection of a powerful wireless plant in the Argentine for direct communication with Germany. German propa-.gandist work in South America is to be stimulated by means of a new &quot; Revista Latino Americana.&quot;AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.Articles in the Austrian and German Press describe two schemes at present under discussion for improving the commercial transport and shipping facilities of Vienna.
The first of these projects is for the concentration.of all. coal translading operations at new docks and works to be erected at Zwischenbrucke by the Danube Steamship Company, an arrangement which is expected to give Vienna a commanding position for Central European trade. The second scheme refers to the construction of a new Danube port, to be built by and for Vienna, on the left bank of the river, at the point where the Elbe Canal is to meet the Danube.SWEDEN.Replying to M. Branting in the Riksdag on 5th June, the Prime Minister declared that the Cabinet have no intention of dealing with the reform of the constitution and suffrage, and consider that these [questions must be left for the people to settle at the forthcoming general elections. To this M. Branting replied that this decision of the Government and Conservative party would lead to an intensified struggle, and that the Socialists would insist on Single Chamber Government and other similar reforms.It was during this debate that serious disturbances took place between the police and the people in Gustavus Adolphus Square. M. Branting and other Socialist leaders did their utmost to restrain the crowd from violence, and subsequently to dissuade them from their proclaimed intention of declaring a general strike ; but the situation remained strained. On the 6th M. Branting demanded the resignation of the Chief of the Stockholm Police. Sir E. Howard thinks that a ministerial crisis may ensue if the demand is refused.Sir E. Ploward regrets the decision of Plis Majesty&apos;s Government not to release any more wheat ships from Halifax for Sweden, inasmuch as, under instructions, he had originally informed the Swedish Government that the cereal cargoes in question would probably arrive in Sweden before the 1st July if the Swedish Government fulfilled their obligations under the Ivogrund agreement. He points out that they are not responsible for the difficulties and delays which have prevented the British ships from leaving the Baltic (only seven had passed out on 7th June) and reiterates his opinion that if the wheat cargoes eventually reach Sweden in a damaged condition, as a result of their detention, Great Britain will lose a valuable opportunity of securing political advantage in Scandinavia at Germany&apos;s expense.Discussing this question with His Majesty&apos;s Minister on 8th June, the Minister for Foreign Affairs appeared to be prepared to give the assurances required in regard to exports and re-exports to Germany. He appeared also to realise that as the Allies now control all available markets for raw materials, they are not likely to allow them to go to any neutral countries which continue to serve as a base of supplies to the enemy.NORWAY.Sir M. Findlay is of opinion that the simplest means of preventing supplies reaching the enemy from Norway is for the United States to begin by demanding the immediate cessation of all exports to Germany, thereafter making such concessions as may be advisable. The commodities required for home consumption by Norway could be based on rations fixed under existing agreements.The Norwegian Government, following the example of Sweden and Denmark, are sending a Mission to Washington (consisting of Dr. Fritjof Nansen and an expert), to discuss questions arising out of the restriction of exports from America.The Norwegian authorities have withdrawn their prohibition of the export of aluminium from British and French owned factories (vide last Report) pending discussion of the requirements of the Norwegian Government for State purposes.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has expressed to the Norwegian Minister the deep regret of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the violation of Norway&apos;s sovereign rights committed by British destroyers in attacking the German S.S. &quot;Gamma&quot; in Norwegian territorial waters on 3rd June.
DENMARK.His Majesty&apos;s (Government have instructed Sir R. Paget to inform the Danish Government that their recent counter-proposals for the conclusion of a fish agreement are unacceptable, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government will therefore continue to refuse facilities for the importation of petroleum into Denmark. (His Majesty&apos;s Government had offered in March to allow oil to be imported in quantities sufficient to enable Danish fishermen to supply home markets on condition that exports of fish to Germany should not exceed 2,000 tons a month, and that exports to neutral-countries should be limited by agreement with Great&apos;Britain.)SPAIN.The &quot; modifications &quot; which the Spanish Government propose to make in the Cortina agreement proved, on examination, to differ so radically from the under-standing recorded in that instrument, as to be quite unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The arrangements now suggested, especially as regards the chartering of Spanish ships, would involve Great Britain in serious obligations to supply coal to Spain, without providing any security for compensating advantages in the matter of tonnage or of iron-ore shipments. The Spanish Ambassador, much exercised at the situation, is leaving for Madrid (furnished with a full Memorandum&apos;on the subject by the Foreign Office), and will explain matters to his Government without delay. In the meanwhile Sir A. Hardinge has been instructed that, so long as iron-ore shipments continue to be satisfactory, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it inadvisable lo bring severe pressure to bear on the Spanish Government ; he is directed, therefore, to temporise and to intimate that the novel character of their present proposals makes it-necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider them carefully before replying. Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to explain to the United States Government the particular reasons for this attitude, and, while urging that the export of coal to Spain should be prohibited as soon as possible, to ask that no other form of pressure be applied for the present.Sir A. Hardinge reported, on 9th June that the Spanish Government were really anxious to come to an agreement in these matters, but their position was rendered delicate and even precarious by certain dangerous elements in the political situation. The Army had defied the King and the democratic parties were threatening a general revolutionary strike. On the iUth the Government tendered their resignation and the King&apos;s personal position was directly threatened by the mutinous military leaders. On the 11th His Majesty, after taking counsel with the several party leaders, urged Senor Prieto to continue in office ; this was found to be imjuracticable and a Conservative Ministry was formed under Senor Uato. The reconstruction of the Liberal Government broke down as the result of disagreement between the Prime Minister and Senor Alba, Minister of Finance. Sir A. Hardinge regards the personnel of the new Government as generally satisfactory. It contains only two avowed pro-Germans, viz., the Ministers of Education and the Interior. The Minister of War is 86 years of age.According to the Spanish Ambassador, British propaganda agents in Spain are to some extent responsible for the anti-monarchical developments of the present crisis -nearly all the Allied propaganda had. been entrusted to extremist politicians and the Socialist Press, Mr. John Walter (the &quot;Times&quot; correspondent in Madrid), be said, had identified himself with the Socialists and had employed as his secretary an alleged anarchist.The British and French representatives at Madrid have been instructed to make representations to the-Spanish Government concerning the reported establishment, with the connivance of Spanish officials, of a base for enemy submarines at Larache.CHINA,The struggle for power between the political and military factions in China continues to be complicated by the advice, and the implied assumptions of support, which they receive from abroad.   On 6th June the United States Minister at Peking3200-2 I)
uhanded a Note to the Chinese Government in which the opinion of the United State was expressed, to the effect that it is more important that China should maintain good and united Government than that she should enter the war against Germany. The advice (very different from that which the same Minister urged upon China when Japan objected to her joining the Allies) is morally unimpeachable ; politically-, it is hailed by the President and his followers as pledging the United States to support them against Premier Tuan and the Military Governors. Mr. Alston observes that the Japanese Minister regards it as an interference in the internal affairs of China.The United States Government have since invited the British and Allied Govern-ments to join them in impressing upon China the paramount importance of putting an end to the present political strife and of maintaining law and order, in preference to declaring war.General Chang Hsim remains at Tientsin, supported by an advance guard of his troops. In addition to the dissolution of Parliament, he demands that the President shall issue a mandate of amnesty in favour of all the officials who were proscribed in connection with Yuan Shih-k&apos;ai&apos;s monarchical movement. There are no signs of political activity or unrest in the south.Meanwhile the contending factions an Peking continue their industrious search for a workable compromise. On Sth June Mr. Alston expressed the opinion that if the President would consent to dissolve Parliament he would probsbly be able to arrange matters with the military party.JAPAN,For some time past the Japanese Government have been preparing plans and selecting the personnel for a special mission which they propose to send to Washington for the discussion of various matters arising out of the war, and particularly the question of naval co-operation. The Mission will probably be led by Viscount Ishii, ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs. The arrangements are complete and the names of the members of the Mission were about to be submitted to Washington, but the communication has now been held up as the result of the United States Note to the Chinese Government, above mentioned.Discussing this matter with Sir C. Greene on the 12th, the Minister for Foreign Affairs observed that the American Note had created a bad impression in Japan. It was inadmissible that the United States, as one of the Allies, should adopt without consultation this independent line of action ; by advising China against declaring war on Germany, they stultified the whole policy of the Allies at Peking. The Japanese Government would address a xn-otest on the subject to Washington. The Japanese Press discusses the incident with its usual inspired restraint, merely observing that the United States appear to overlook Japaits special historical and political position in China.An Advisory Committee on Foreign Affairs was instituted by Decree on 6th June to report directly to the Emperor. It consists of 10 members, five being members of the Cabinet and the remainder representatives of the Privy Council, Upper House, and political parties, under the presidency of the Premier. Viscount Kato has declined to serve on the Committee, on the ground that its duties are inconsistent with the principle of ministerial responsibility.SIAM.His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Bangkok has been privately informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the draft of a confidential Circular Note which the Siamese Government are about to address to the Allied representatives. It will declare their intention to follow the example of the United States, and to emphasise Siam&apos;s protest against the submarine campaign, by declaring a state of war with the Central Powers. The Siamese Government are aware that the military aid they can render will not be great, but they are prepared to do everything in their power to assist the Allies. They will seize the nine German vessels in the river, and they will deport, if possible, all German and Austrian subjects to the Dutch East Indies, , u
ARGENTINA.Trie Argentine Government having heavy Joan obligations in the United . States all of which are due for repayment this year and some this month, Sir G. Spring Rice, has been instructed to suggest to the State Department that a refusal to renew these loans might be made to serve as leverage useful to the purposes of the Allies in the conduct of the war.BRAZIL.Sir A. Peel has received information from a confidential source that an agreement is being negotiated between Brazil and the United States to cover the period of the war and to be replaced thereafter by a commercial and political Treaty. Under this provisional agreement the United States will assist Brazil to equip and re-organise her arsenals and shipbuilding plant and to establish steel and iron works. Meanwhile, it is understood that under the economic and fiscal conditions eventually to be arranged, the contracting parties will mutually concede rights of preferential treatment.The United States Government have bought up the entire cocoa crop in Brazil.URUGUAY.Instructed by his Government, the Brazilian Minister at Montevideo sounded the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to the willingness of the Uruguayan Government to identify themselves with Brazibs pro-Ally policy, and received a favourable reply. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed the United States Minister that if an American squadron visits Montevideo, it will not be treated as belligerent. The Brazilian authorities are most anxious that the United. States should send a squadron, because, in their opinion, Argentina would be practically obliged to treat it no less courteously and favourably.MEXICO.Acting under instructions from, the foreign Office, Mr. Cummins has lodged a protest with the Mexican Government (9fch June), on the subject of their predatory activities directed against various British properties. On the same day the Mexican authorities levied a further sum of $300,000 (Mex.) from the Tramway Company.In view of the shortage of oil in the United States,- which must be made up from Mexico, the United States Ambassador has been directed to protest strongly against the Governments proposed legislation for the taxation of petroleum, which amounts 1o confiscation. On 12th June Mr. Cummins, learning that the Decree was about to be published, proposed to the United States Ambassador an immediate joint representation to secure its postponement pending discussion. The Ambassador was, however, reluctant to move in the matter, and suggested that the British representative should act alone, on the ground that the Mexican Government are peculiarly sensitive about American interference. Eventually, a member of the Embassy staff was sent with Mr. Cummins and joined him in requesting the Mexican Foreign Office to speak to Senor Carranza in the desired sense. The State Department at Washington has no immediate anxiety about the safety of the oil fields and believes that Sehor Carranza is gradually losing his faith in Germany and becoming more amenable to reason.UNITED STATES.Sir C. Spring Rice reported on 7th June that legislation was being prepared in Congress for the establishment of a Committee, with Mr. Hoover as Food Controller, to control the purchase of all foodstuff supplies in the United States, and to work in conjunction with the Canadian authorities.Partly owing to fear of submarine attacks and partly to secure higher wages, seamen have been deserting in increasing numbers from British ships in American
THE SHIFTING SITUATION.The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister that the Germans are not attaching to their 1st of July safe-conduct any conditions in restriction of Allied trade. A number of Swedish ships are coming to Great Britain in order to avail themselves of the opportunity of a safe return. It is understood that Germany&apos;s offer is intended to be in reparation for the recent sinkings of Swedish ships.On 8th June, His Majesty&apos;s representative at Christiania was informed by the Prime Minister that the law had been passed empowering the Government to refuse ship charters for other than Allied countries and that its execution will be entrusted to the Shipowners&apos; Association. With a view to concluding the details of the proposed agreement, it has been arranged that five delegates from Norway will now come to London, rejiresentative shipowners, importers, and the Food Director. Sir M. Findlay reports that the Norwegian representatives are anxious to centralise and control the import and distribution of coal, but they have been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to abandon their existing control. In connection with the negotiations lor this Norwegian tonnage agreement, certain questions have been raised at Washington by interested parties as to the possible effect upon American trade and shipping interests of the withdrawal of certain classes of Norwegian vessels from Transatlantic traffic. The United States Government have also signified their reluctance to sec neutral ships pressed into the danger zone. In this matter Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to explain that the Norwegians, dependent as they are upon British coal carried in British ships, and with prospective benefits of other assistance, may fairly be asked to incur risks which cannot justly be imposed upon those neutral countries which are dependent on Germany, such as Holland and Sweden.Idle United States Government have purchased seven Austrian vessels in American ports, free of all restrictions as to trading limits. Idle transaction has involved a remittance of $8,000,000 to Austria and $2,000,000 to South America. With reference to the German ships seized by the United States Government, Sir C. Spring Rice has been directed to point out the risk that, in certain countries (e.g.. Spain), they may be libelled and held up on a contested title. Also it is to be noted that Dutch law excludes from Dutch ports all ships which have changed their status as the result of a belligerent act.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Evidence is increasing in the German and Austrian Press that Austria, Bulgaria, and Turkey are combining to resist the pressure which Germany has lately been bringing to bear upon her Allies to secure a quadruple Zollverein. The &quot;Frankfurter&quot; of 8th June hints at a. serious hitch in the Austro-German tariff negotiations. The &quot; Leipziger Yol.kszeiti.mg&quot; of the 9th incautiously admits that the conclusion of the i3roposed Zollverein would tie the hands of Germany&apos;s Allies at the Peace Conference. They perceive the nature and purpose of the fait accompli for which Germany is working, which would leave her undisputed command of the economic situation in Central Europe.waters. There being no power to arrest deserters under the existing laws of the United States, the situation at many ports (notably Galveston) is becoming very serious, and. the United States Government are powerless to relieve it. Sir O. Spring Rice observes that it would be extremely difficult to secure suspension of the United States Seameids Act during the war ; he therefore suggests, with the concurrence of the United States Navy Department, that a special treaty be made at once between the United States and the British Government providing for the arrest and. extradition of deserters from the naval and military forces of either country. The treaty would, -require to be so framed as to bring merchant seamen within the category of naval forces.
The recent pronouncement by Dr. Solf, Colonial Secretary, on the; reorganisation of Germany&apos;s Colonial Empire after the war, has been generally accepted by the Press as an expression of Government policy. In the &quot;Deutsche Tageszeitung&quot; of 9th June, even Reyentlow gives it his blessing, with the proviso that the Colonial Secretary&apos;s programme be stiffened by the annexation of the Flanders coast. The &quot; Vossische &quot; concurs, observing that the freedom of the seas is worth nothing unless&quot; Germany secures all the Belgian ports, including Antwerp. The &quot; Frankfurter &quot; admits that the consolidation of Germany:s Colonial Empire in Africa may involve certain exchanges. The &quot; Tagliche Rundschau&quot; declares that Germany&apos;s Colonies are not fit matter for general bargaining, and demands that the question be excluded from the European Conference negotiations.Sir E. Howard, reported on 11th June that the prospects of any real Conference taking place at Stockholm were dwindling. A split had occurred amongst the German Socialist majority delegates, some of whom disapprove of Scheidemann as representing no views beyond those of the Chancellor. The Dutch Scandinavian Committee are annoyed with the Russian Workmeids Council, and greatly disappointed by the turn of events in England and France. The German Minority Delegates have not arrived.The German official wireless news service of the 11th June gives a very full account of the speeches delivered at Stockholm hy Herr Scheidemann and Dr. David, but makes no reference to any difference of opinion between them. On the contrary, both speakers are reported to have denounced Imperialism (British Imperialism) as the fundamental cause of the war, and to have insisted on the earnest efforts made by Germany, &quot;to avoid, or at least to localise it.&quot; Dr. David was at pains to prove that Europe&apos;s warlike tension was due to economic pressure, brought about by Great Britain&apos;s policy of isolating Germany and shutting her out from, the sources of raw materials. The Entente was nothing but a huge syndicate for exploiting the world and German policy was purely defensive. . It was Russia that fanned the Austro-Serbian outbreak into a general conflagration, but. England was directly responsible for all the misfortunes of Belgium. On these points the voices of the majority Socialists would appear to have been tuned to satisfactory unison.The International Trade Union Conference convened to be held at Stockholm on 8th June is now postponed till September, and the venue changed to Switzerland. Deputations to this Conference had been sent from Holland, Germany, Austria-and the Scandinavian countries.The Italian Socialists who went to Petrograd. at the invitation of. the Workm.en&apos;s Council, have been expressing themselves freely in a very Imperialistic strain, which, coupled with the Albanian proclamation, has produced an unfavourable impression on. the exponents of peace without annexation.- The Socialist Press in Petrograd has criticised, the passage in the French Note referring to Alsace-Lorraine, regarding it as evidence of Imperialistic tendencies on the part of Great Britain and France. Sir G. Buchanan has drawn the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the unfairness of these attacks and suggested that the. Soci alist Press should he led to understand that they are not in a position to dictate to the Entente Powers the future conditions of a permanent peace. The Minister for Foreign Affairs begged His Excellency not to attach undue importance to the utterances of the noisy minority of extremists. Many of these people, he said, are in German pay and the Government is preparing evidence on which to proceed against them.An unconfirmed report from Geneva refers to the presence there (and alleged negotiations) of Count Mensdorff and M. Caillaux.GENERAL.The proposal to hold a meeting between British and German officials at the Hague, to discuss various questions concerning fhe treatment of prisoners of war and interned civilians, has met with a cordial reception in Berlin. Sir W. Townley was informed on the 11th that the German Government hoped that Lord Newton would come to the Hague for this purpose as soon as possible.In this connection it is to be noted that His Majesty&apos;s Government have directed Sir W.  Townley (7th June) to convey an immediate protest through the Dutch3209-2 B
authorities to the German Government with reference to the deliberate and shocking barbarity to which British prisoners have been subjected in occupied territory on both fronts. Irrefutable evidence of the atrocities committed has been obtained from men who have recently escaped to England.A further protest has been made with regard to the stoppage of parcels for British prisoners (vide last Report). The Dutch Government have been requested to point out that there can be no justification for punishing English prisoners for acts alleged to have been committed by the French.The Swiss Volksbank recently issued a confidential circular to its branches,, instructing them not to accept damaged or blood-stained French notes when offered by Germans. The Basle branch refused 250,000 francs worth of such notes, presented by German agents.With reference to the holding up of transit mails in Sweden, Sir E. Howard has been directed (Sth June) to inform the Swedish Government that Bis Majesty&apos;s Government claim the resumption of transit mail traffic as a matter of right and not of bargaining. In proof of their goodwill, however, they will make no claims for compensation for the stoppages that have occurred, provided that regular service is now resumed.The Dutch Government have been requested to address further and urgent representations to the Ottoman Government, and to ask for a definite reply, in regard, to the proposed exchange and repatriation of incapacitated prisoners of war.
APPENDIXtoWestern and General report, No. 20.Conscription in the Dominions and its Effect on Political Parties.It is of interest to note that Mr. Hughes, on his return to Australia after the visit to Europe of 1916, made his proposals for the adoption of conscription in the Commonwealth ; and, in a similar manner, Sir Robert Borden, on his return to Canada after the meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917, has proposed a policy of conscription for his Dominion. The effect on political parties in the Australian Commonwealth is dealt with on page 20, but the influence upon the politics of the Dominion can be, as yet, only vaguely estimated.CANADA.Sir Robert Borden made his first announcement on the subject to the Canadian House of Commons on the 18th May;   In the course of this he said : &quot; We have our Canadian divisions at the front. For the immediate future there are sufficient reinforcements. But four divisions cannot be maintained without thorough provision for future requirements. If these reinforcements are not supplied, what will be the consequence ? The consequence will be that the four divisions will dwindle to three, the three will dwindle to two, and Canada&apos;s effort, so splendid in this war up to this time, will not be maintained as we desire it to be maintained.&quot;After pointing out the great results which Canada had already accomplished under the voluntary system, Sir Robert Borden stated that he returned to Canada &quot; impressed &quot; at once with the extreme gravity of the situation and with a sense of responsibility &quot; for our further effort at the most critical period of the war.&quot; He then went on to say : &quot; It is apparent to me that the voluntary system will not yield further substantial results. ... I realise that the responsibility is a serious one, but I do not shrink from it. Therefore it is my duty to announce to the House that early proposals will be made on the part of the Government to provide compulsory military enlistment on a selective basis for such reinforcements as may be necessary to maintain the Canadian army to-day in the field as one of the finest fighting units of the Empire.&quot;The estimated numbers required were stated by the Prime Minister to be not less than 50,000 and probably 100,000,1 and the Bill itself, as introduced on the 11th June, provides for securing the reinforcements up to the larger number, there being-ten classes of men between the ages of 20 and 45. In his remarks when introducing the Bill, the Prime Minister observed that the principle of compulsion was recognised in the Militia Act, which had been eudorsed by Sir Wilfred Laurier, but which was considered unsatisfactory in relation to present conditions. Under that Act, he pointed out &quot; all Canadians are liable to serve in the defence of their country. . . . &quot; To-day,&quot; he continued, &quot; the first line of Canadian defence is in the North Sea and &quot; in the trenches in France. When the Canadians at Ypres barred the German path &quot; to Calais, they barred the enemy&apos;s way to Halifax and to Quebec.&quot;As to the immediate effect upon the Parties, the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) did not commit himself on the first occasion when the subject was raised in the House, beyond saying that &quot; Canada intends to remain in the War1 The Minister of Militia stated in the House of Commons on 14th May that the National Service Registration Cards gave &quot; military prospects &quot; as 364,470 ; but, as some 40 per cent, are engaged in essential industry, Canada apparently has available something like 150,000 men of military age who have not yet enlisted.
to the end, nntil victory has been won,&quot; and that a good deal of consideration had to be given before the traditional policy followed by the country should be set aside.Subsequently Sir Robert Borden requested Sir Wilfrid Laurier to join in the formation of a Coalition Cabinet, consisting of an equal number of representatives of each of the great Parties, on the understanding that, if the voluntary system failed to provide the necessary number of men, the Government should resort to compulsion, after a General Election, in order to ensure the maintenance of the Canadian divisions.The result of the negotiations, however, was disclosed in a letter addressed by the Prime Minister to Sir Wilfrid Laurier last week, in the course of which he stated : &quot; I am convinced that compulsory service is necessary and must be included in the policy of the proposed Coalition. You, on the other hand, decided that you&apos;could not accept such a course and that you could -not join a Government which adopted it.&quot;Sir Wilfrid Laurier, however, agreed that, if conscription were adopted, after the people had been consulted, he would certainly urge obedience to the law. But he stated on 11th June that his duties in the matter were scarcely less important than those of the Prime Minister and that his position involved as great difficulties as those of Sir R. Borden.Meantime it has been made clear that the attitude of Sir Wilfrid Laurier in opposing the policy of conscription does not receive the support of the whole of the Liberal Party, or indeed of the Liberal Press, for the leading organ, the &quot; Toronto Globe,&quot; is one of the Liberal papers declaring in favour of conscription. At a mass meeting of Liberals which has just been held in Toronto, it was decided to support conscription and repudiate Sir w. LaurieFs leadership. In the course of this, Mr. Rowell, the leader of the Liberal Party in the Province of Ontario, declared himself in favour of the proposed measures of compulsion, and he was supported by a Liberal Member of the &quot;Dominion House of Commons for one of the western constituencies (Dr. Michael Clark, Member for Red Deer, Alberta). It is also to be noted that Mr. W. S. Fielding (ex-Liberal Minister of Finance) declared some time ago that conscription would have to be adopted if the war situation seemed to render it necessary.&apos;On the other hand, however, the great majority of French Liberal Members will no doubt oppose the Conscription Bill; and those French-Canadians who support the Conservative Party may adopt a similar attitude to that of Mr. Patenaude, who, as -one of their number, has just resigned his position as Secretary of State in the present Government owing to his opposition to the Bill. It is, in fact, anticipated that not more than five French-Canadian Members will support conscription.The leaders of Labour have hitherto been generally opposed to compulsory service, but they have recently had conferences with the Prime Minister, as a result of which the attitude, at any rate of some of them, may undergo some change.All that can confidently be asserted at the present moment is that the conscription issue will exercise a considerable influence upon the political parties in the Dominion, and, while Sir Wilfrid Laurier will probably carry with him in his opposition to the proposals the majority of the French-Canadian Liberals in the country, and practically the -whole of the French-Canadian Nationalists, there is a possibility of Sir Robert Borden being able to form a coalition with some, at any rate, of the leading Liberals. At the last meeting of the Liberal caucus, however, it seems that freedom to vote on the conscription question, according to conscientious convictions, was favoured; and the offer of the Government to three leading Liberals to join a coalition has, up to the present, been declined, though these members will no doubt support the measure.   A general election is an almost certain outcome of the whole matter.AUSTRALIA.It is in Australia that the introduction of the policy of conscription for Oversea Service has exercised, up to the present time, the most powerful influence upon the fortunes of political parties.In August of 1916 Mr. Hughes was Prime Minister and Leader ofa the Labour Party, with a small majority over the Liberals in the House of Representatives and a majority in the Senate.   Mr. Tudor was a member of his Administration as Minister1 January 1917.
for Customs. On the 10th of that month the Prime Minister made a striking statement to - the House of Representatives to the effect&apos; that, in view of urgent and grave communications from the British War Council, the Government had arrived at the conclusion that the voluntary system of recruiting could not be relied upon to supply that steady stream of reinforcements necessary to maintain the Australian Expeditionary Forces at their full strength.In differentiating the policy he was about to propose from that which had hitherto prevailed in the Commonwealth, Mr. Hughes said:-&quot; To the principle of compulsion for military-training and&apos;service the country has long been committed.   But a clear line has been drawn between compulsory service within the Commonwealth and service overseas.   For the first we relied entirely upon compulsion, for the latter upon voluntaryism.   Until recently, voluntary recruiting proved sufficient to meet the demands made upon us, but latterly it has quite failed to do so.&quot; &apos; After referring to the fact that Great Britain had. hitherto refrained from suggesting the number of troops Australia   should   send   on   account of   the  &quot; traditional &quot; reticence which very properly hedges about the relations between Great Britain and &quot;the self-governing Dominions,&quot; the Prime Minister stated that the definite task was to provide 32,500 men in September of .1916 and a further 16,500 in each of the months of October, November and December, with  probably a  continuance  of reinforcements at the same monthly rate.   In short, as subsequently explained1, Australia had been asked to maintain five Australian divisions at full strength.   As voluntary recruiting was only bringing in some 6,000 a month, the Government decided  to submit to-a Referendum of the people their proposals to extend the compulsory provision of the Defence Act to service overseas.As a result of this policy several members of Mr. Hughes&apos; Administration resigned, and the bulk of the Labour Party in the Lower House, withdrew their support and elected Mr. Tudor as their official leader.The subsequent Referendum campaign was conducted with great vehemence on both sides, and many influences, including the fear of coloured labour being imported to take the place of the men sent to the trenches2, combined to defeat the proposals of the Government. Apart from these various influences used in the campaign, perhaps the simplest explanation was given by one of Mr. Hughes&apos; chief helpers in these words : &quot; Labour opinion in Australia is expressed by a machine. The Unions receive orders from their Councils ; the Councils from their Executives ; the Executives from the Trades Hall Council; and this in turn from the Trades Hall Executive. Whoever, then, captures that small Executive, captures the entire machine. A few men, with political ambitions, did it, and. swung the entire labour vote over immediately.&quot;Mr. Hughes himself referred to the procedure in these words : &quot; A number of obscure persons sit in secret conclave and issue instructions to the members . &quot; of the Caircus party , and upon these instructions the Caucus acts.1&quot;However, the final figures3 in the Referendum were Against -----   1,100,033For - - - - -   1,087,557Majority against      - -       72,-176Being left with only about 12 supporters in the House of Representatives (out of some 40 of his former Labour supporters), Mr. Hughes was forced to rely upon the support of Mr. Cook, the Leader of the Liberal Party, in order to maintain office, and in February negotiations took place for the formation of a Coalition Government. On this being accomplished, with Mr. Hughes as Prime Minister and Mr. Cook as Minister for the Navy, Mr. Hughes hoped to be able to prolong the life of Parliament in order to permit of his attending the War Conference in London, but, as he could not secure sufficient support in the Senate, he felt obliged to appeal to the country for a fresh1 Speech at Bendigo, jMarch 1917.&quot; Amongst the prominent posters used in the campaign was &quot; &quot;Vote &apos; rTo &apos; and keep Australia White.&quot; 3 The Australian soldiers in different parts cf the world exercised their vote  72,000 voting in favour, and 58,000 against.3209-2 f
mandate from the people.   In the General Election which followed, the supporters of Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook combined as the &quot; Nationalist &quot; Party, and the official Labour Party took the anti-conscription attitude under Mr. Tudor. Mr. Hughes stated in his Manifesto : &quot; The people of Australia decided, on 28th.October last, at the Referendum, that they would not resort to compulsion to fill the ranks of the Australian Divisions at the front. The Government which I lead accepts and will respect the decision of the peoxde on this question. Although I could have forced conscription upon the people by regulation, as a democrat I took the democratic way, and referred ,the question to the people, and as a democrat I abide by their verdict.&quot;But he subsequently declared1 that, if the national safety demanded it, the question would again be referred to the people.Mr. Tudor, on the other hand, endeavoured to secure the votes of the Electorate by suggesting in his Manifesto that if the Ministerialists were returned it was possible that they might claim that the people had reversed the anti-conscription decision. Pie recognised, however, that &quot; the war is still the most pressing and insistent question confronting us,&quot; and. affirmed that if again entrusted with the control of Australia^ share in the war, Labour would &quot; continue under the voluntary system to secure the services of every man fit and willing to proceed to the front.&quot;During the election, the Nationalists received the name of the &quot; win the war &quot; party, and though the issues were perhaps not so sharply defined as in the Referendum campaign, there was certainly less scope for misrepresentation. However, the final results gave Mr. Hughes a majority in the Lower House of 31, and in the Senate of about 12.While the Conscription question has therefore profoundly altered the position, of parties in Australia, it is to be noted that the proposal to put the policy into practical effect is by no means dead. Sir William Irvine, one of the ablest of Australians public men, who fought his own election on the conscription issue, and increased, his majority from 1,4-00 to 7,000, is again strongly urging the immediate adoption of Compulsory Service,2 and he is fairly certain to join no Ministry that is not pledged to it; while one of Mr. Hughes&apos; Ministers (Mr. Jensen) has already advocated another Referendum on the subject.NEW ZEALAND AND SOUTH AFRICA.In the Dominion of New Zealand and the Union of South Africa it may fairly be said that the matter of Conscription has exercised no real influence upon the inter-relation of political parties.New Zealand is the only Dominion which has enforced the principle of Compulsion for oversea service by legislative enactment, for by the Military Service Act of August 1910 provision was made for an &quot; Expeditionary Force Reserve.&quot; As explained by the Minister of Defence (Colonel Allen) in moving the Second Reading of the Measure in the House of Representatives on 30th May 1916, &quot; the Bill allows the voluntary &quot; principle to continue in existence, but it backs it with a scheme of National Military &quot; Service, thereby securing the necessary number of reinforcements.&quot;The Minister quoted the policy of Abraham Lincoln in 1863 as providing analogies between the action then taken and the proposals of the New Zealand Government both in fixing the military age at 20 to 45 years, and in dividing the country into districts, with a quota to be provided by each district.While certain speeches against the principle of compulsion were delivered in the House of Representatives during the debate by Members representing Labour constituencies, the Second Reading of- the Bill was carried by a majority of 44, only five Members voting against it.The men who are to serve under the compulsory provisions of the Act are selected by lot, and the first schedule of those to be called up for service in this way with the-Expeditionary Force, was given in the &quot;Gazette&quot; of 23rd November 1916. Other schedules have subsequently appeared.1 6th April 1917.2 21st May 1917.
Since the Act has been in force, certain municipal elections were fought on 25th April last, very largely upon the issue of conscription, and the anti-militarists proved very unsuccessful.1In South Africa, the Union Defence Act, which was passed so far back as 1912,-recognises the principle of Compulsory Service. Indeed it does more, for, in making provision for compulsory registration, and recognising that some form of personal service should be required of all persons between 17 and 60, it provides a well-considered scheme for utilising voluntary effort, while keeping compulsion in the background for use in the last resort. Though, under the Act, no one can be compulsorily sent for service oversea, there is no doubt that many who joined up under its provisions have served outside Union territory in the recent campaigns in South-West or East Africa. This has called forth some criticism from certain of the Nationalists who, while objecting to the Act in its provision for general con-scription as against the old commando system, further state that at the time it was passed it was never contemplated that the Act would be used in connection with any offensive war.1 An example of this waa afforded at Christchurch, where the retiring- Mayor was re-elected by a majority of 6,700 over his opponent who stood as an anti-conscriptionist.
