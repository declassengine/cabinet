APPRECIATION  OE THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERALREPORT, No. 22.Canada.The Second Reading debate on the Compulsory Service Bill lias revealed the very widest differences between English Liberal members, those from Ontario and the West generally supporting the Bill and parting company with Sir W. Laurier. The French members are mainly ranged against the Bill, but with some prominent exceptions.- - South Africa.The summary, given in the Appendix, of recent developments of the . republican campaign carried out by the Nationalist Party, deserves careful study. General Hertzog has attempted to find a constitutional justification for his separatist agitation by denying that the sovereignty of the Crown involves anything beyond a purely personal link between South Africa and the rest of the Empire. General Botha&apos;s answer is the... common sense one that the link does exist in the sentiments of the British,section of.the population, and can only be dissevered by civil war in South Africa, and that.the permanent constitutional connection between South Africa and Great Britain involves no interference in South Africa&apos;s real independence but, on the contrary, is an essential condition of her security and well-being.-, ... Greece.The transition between the abdication of King Constantine and the instalment in office of M. Venizelos has been remarkably smooth and rapid. The real outstanding difficulty now is the attitude of Italy in Epirus. This may seriously prejudice Franco-Italian relations. Otherwise its effect on the internal situation in Greece can only be good, for it puts M. Venizelos in the position, which King Constantine has hitherto occupied, of the champion of Greek independence against foreign interference. While Greek pride, especially in the Army, has resented French arbitrariness, Greek political, instinct has always regarded Italian ambitions in Albania and the iEgean as constituting a far graver menace to Greek interests, and M. Venizelos will rally all Greece round him in pressing for the recognition of the authority of his Government in Epirus,Serbia.The break up of the Coalition Ministry and the execution of Colonel Dragutin Dimitrievitch (reported in this morning&apos;s papers) may have a most serious effect, not only upon the moral of the Serbian army, with whom Colonel Dimitrievitch was a popular hero, but also on the Allied cause in the Jugoslav world generally. The Austrians will naturally make the most of it in Serbia and Bosnia.
Austrian Affairs.The Austrian political crisis jogs along. The ,instalment of a stopgap: ministry of civil servants indicates that the negotiations between the different parties may take some time. The session of the Reichsrath has been the occasion of some strong anti-German and nationalist speeches by the various nationalities, which, to the uninitiated, might suggest that Austria is in the throes of complete dissolution. It will serve as a corrective to exaggerated hopes to remember; that, though Austria is a conglomerate of Irelands and Ulsters, conscription is enforced and order maintained by a Goyern-inent which listens with complacent indifference to Nationalist leaders blowing off steam in Parliament.Scandinavia.The discovery of the German official bomb importing agency in Norway ought to unite sentiment in all three Scandinavian countries against German methods. A solid Scandinavia prepared to stand firm against German intimidation would be a great asset to the Allied cause.Stain. &apos;&apos;&apos; -,The proclamation of martial law marks a further stage in the crisis&apos;, which,&apos;so far, has remained purely local in its character. As far as it goes the new Dato Ministry is slightly more favourable to the Allies than its. predecessor.

PART l-BRITISH EMPIRE AND  AFRICA.GENERAL.Regarding the transport of Australian and New Zealand troops1 through the Panama Canal, the Government of the United States have hitherto failed to give any specific assurance that full facilities will he accorded for the adoption of this route. The British Ambassador at Washington has been instructed to obtain this assurance as soon as possible, as failing this the present scheme would have to be abandoned.take a similar course stated that he would a question of party,CANADA.The Second Reading of the Compulsory Service Bill was moved in the Dominion House of Commons by the Prime Minister on 19th June. Sir Wilfred Laurier moved an amendment to the effect that the question of conscription should be submitted to a Referendum, on the ground that Parliament should not force through a vital change for which it had no mandate, for which the people had not been educated, and on which a great difference of opinion had been shown.In the course of the Debate which took place on the following days the Chief Liberal Whip (Mr. P. P. Pardee) stated his intention to support the Conscription Bill. Amongst other Liberals who declared their determination to were Mr. George Graham (formerly Minister of Railways), who act upon his conscientious convictions and that it was notMr. Hugh Guthrie (Member for Wellington, Out.), Mr. G. E. McCrauey (member for Saskatoon), Mr. W. A. Buchanan (member for Medicine Hat), Dr. M. Clark (member for Red Deer), and Mr. Maclean (member for Halifax). The Solicitor-General (Mr. Arthur Meighen) announced that owing to the courage and patriotism of some members on the opposition side the passage of the Bill was assured. Sir Sam Hughes (till recently Minister of Militia in the Conservative Government) expressed himself in favour of invoking the Militia Act, but failing that he would support the Bill; while Mr. Rodolphe Lemieux (formerly Liberal Minister for Marine, &amp;c.) complained that the voluntary system had not been properly administered in Quebec. On the other hand, Sir Edward Kemp (Minister of Militia and Defence) stated that the recruiting campaign of Colonel Blondin for a French-Canadian Battalion only yielded 221 soldiers, of whom only 92 had enlisted from Quebec Province. Mr. Albert Sevigny, the French-Canadian Minister of Inland Revenue, &apos;stated that the anti-conscriptionists had threatened his life, but that nevertheless he would support conscription and that his Province (Quebec) would support it when it was rightly understood. The first opposition from the Conservative side raised in the Debate came from Mr. J. A. Barrette, member for Berthier (Que.) ; but the Bill, was supported by Mr. Robidoux (member for Kent and. representing the Acadians in New Brunswick).Owing to certain newspaper despatches to Canada inferring that Sir R. Borden had proposed conscription because he was urged to do so at the Imperial War Cabinet, the Canadian Associated Press has been authorised by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to give a denial to the suggestion. In the course of this it is stated that the matter of conscription for Canada was not even mentioned in the Imperial War Cabinet or Conference, and that the last thing members of the Home Govern-ment would do is to interfere in an entirely Canadian matter. The Secretary of State adds that he saw Sir Robert Borden frequently up to the last day he was in England, and had no idea when Sir Robert left that he was going to propose the introduction of conscription on his return to the Dominion.The Governor-General, by telegram to the Secretary of State, reports as follows regarding the provision of troops : Troops despatched during May 1917.New Units.lteinforcemei i ts.Number undergoing Training.Officers.	i -Men.            1	Officers	Men.

The Serbian-Government are desirous of calling up for service the Serbians who are now in Canada, and the Dominion Government have been asked to give their views on the matter.Tiie British Board of Trade having suggested that the price of cheese should be reduced by one cent per lb. as from 1st July, the Dominion Minister of Agriculture has expressed his opposition to any reduction taking place. It is pointed out by the representative of the Board of Trade in Canada that the.present prices should be considered as the buying rate for the entire season in the absence of anything happening of an abnormal character.In reply to inquiry, the Dominion Ministers state that the Canadian Mint is working at its full capacity refining South African gold and minting Canadian silver, and that to undertake coinage for American firms would much reduce the output of refined gold for the Imperial Treasury.AUSTRALIAN COMM on wealth.Mr. Hughes has, according to Commonwealth cables, opened a thrift campaign with the object of raising 30,000,000/.. of small savings. In the course of his speech at Melbourne, the Prime Minister is reported to have stated that it was not beyond the capacity of Australia to raise a great sum by war-savings certificates. Sir John Forrest (Commonwealth Treasurer) stated that Australia had borrowed 128,000,000Z. for. the war. Of this 80,000,000/. had been raised in Australia, and he thought the conntiw could raise whatever was required in the future. If the 30,000,000/. now wanted were subscribed, he looked forward to obtaining a further 48,000,000/. to pay Great Britain back. Australia would then have the whole of its war loan subscribed by its own people.With reference to the points raised by the Commonwealth Government as to the mutual trading rights of British and Japanese subjects in captured territory1, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has conveyed to the Attstralian Ministers that he cannot give an authoritative rendering of the words &quot; same treatment to Japanese subjects as to British subjects,&quot; without reference to Tokio, and he does not wish to raise the matter with Japan at present. Meantime it should be assumed that the phrase applies to trade facilities only. As to the extension to all British subjects of the trading facilities granted to Messrs. Burns, Philp &amp; Co., in the Marshall Islands, this matter is now being considered by Japan, and the Government of that country ask if the Commonwealth intend to extend similar treatment to Japanese subjects generally in the territory captured from Germany.In connection with this it has been reported by the Japanese Consul-General at Sydney that the Australian Government are preventing the importation of Japanese labour required by Japanese firms in. the captured territory of New Guinea, except in regard to those returning to the country, or members of families of those already established in the country, and the Tokio Government wish to know if this is the policy decided upon. The Commonwealth Government have therefore been asked for information on this head, and generally as to any differential treatment of Japanese in the occupied territory.The Returned Soldiers&apos; Association has passed a resolution in favour of conscription.The Commonwealth Government point out that owing to the failure of British manufacturers to supply tin plates, the Australian users placed orders in America. Representations were thereupon made by the British Munitions Department, as a result of which the Commonwealth put an embargo on the American plates, being-assured, however, that the United Kingdom would supply all Australian requirements during the war. As the Commonwealth orders are not now being carried out, many local industries are being seriously affected, and the help of the British Government is sought in the matter.As it has been decided by the Siamese Government to sever relations with the Central Powers, and it is desired to avoid the criticism likely to arise through interning Europeans in an Oriental country, the Commonwealth Government have been asked if they will receive about 270 Germans of military age, who are now in Siam, for internment in Australia.See Western and General Report for week ending 23rd May 1917.
The Premier of Western Australia (Mr. Wilson) has resigned, and Mr. Lefroy, the present Minister for Lands and Leader of the Nationalist Party in Western Australia, has been ashed to form an Administration, and has undertaken to do so.With reference to the Mormon Missionaries desirous of proceeding to Australia1, the Commonwealth request that the visa may be refused.A proclamation was published in the &quot;Gazette&quot; of 19th June prohibiting the importation into the Commonwealth of tea which is not produced in British possessions, except with the consent of&quot;die Minister of Trade and Customs. new ZEALAND.Mr. Massey and Sir Joseph Ward have arrived (26th June) at Wellington on their return from England. The change of title of Governor of New Zealand to that of Governor-General is announced, and Lord Liverpool will be sworn in as Governor-General on 28th June.In reply to the telegrams from the Dominion Government regarding the disposition of captured territory in the Pacific3, the British Government have telegraphed their recognition of the vital importance of the matter to Australia and New Zealand, The Dominion Ministers are assured that, when the time for decision comes, the fullest weight will be given to their wishes.With regard to the wish of the Dominion Government that the substance of their telegram should be incorporated in the speech at the opening of Barliament, the Secretary of State has informed the Ministers that there is no objection to this or to the publication of the reply of the British Government which is given above.In response to the request of the French Government for the name of a suitable British resident at Apia who can act as the French Consular Agent in Samoa41 the New Zealand Government have consulted the Administrator and suggest the name of Mr. Allom, the Manager of Messrs. Burns, Philp &amp; Co. in Samoa, for the post.In reply to an enquiry on the subject, the War Office have informed the Dominion Government that they have no objection to candidates of Maori blood being sent from the Canterbury Aviation School for admission to the Royal Flying Corps.SOUTH AFRICA.The Union Ministers state their inability to spare any of the South African Mounted Riflemen for service in East Africa, but they are raising a new mounted regiment which will be sent complete with horses, and maintained up to strength. In the event of a second regiment of a similar character being required, the South African Government will endeavour to raise it.The Government of the Union have heard that inferior mealie meal is being sent to England, which by the time it reaches its destination will probably be unfit for human consumption. The Ministers point out that if the best mealies are sent it would be advisable that they should be nulled in England, in order to avoid risk of deterioration. In any case, however, it is suggested that the quantities already bought and the firms from whom they have been purchased should be telegraphed to South Africa so that the Government may arrange for inspection at the mills and at the ports.The Union Government have promised to make a sxiecial effort to supply 64 men to man the machine gun section of the Nigerian Contingent.A Socialist meeting was held at Johannesburg at the commencement of the present month for the purpose of sending a delegation to the Stockholm Conference. The Chairman refused to allow members of the International Socialist League to speak, but on his leaving the meeting the International Socialists passed a Resolution to send Mr. Andrews, a former Labour Member of the Union Parliament, to Stockholm.1 See Western and General Report for week ending&apos; 20th June 1917, under &quot; General.&quot; 2 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending- 30th May and 12th June 1917. 3 See Western and General Report for weeks ending 12th and 20th June 1917. 4 See Western and General Report for week ending 20th June 1917. 3209-4 li
The Loan Estimates were discussed in the House of Assembly on 2Cth June, including the gift of 1.000,000/,. towards the general war expenditure of the Imperial Government. The Nationalists opposed the gift and moved an amendment expressing the unpreparedness of the House to vote the Estimates which included the gift instead of providing a solution for the &quot; poor white&quot; question, and removing burdens connected with repatriation, debts, and the recent rebellion. The amendment was rejected without a division.GERMAN EAST AFRICA.The General Officer Commanding has considered it necessary, in view of the extensive and possibly prolonged action against Naumann&apos;s force, to resume tempo-temporarily the complete control of all areas within the scope of military operations, and political officers have been instructed to this effect. It has been arranged that unless NaumamTs force is accounted for by 2-fth June the British troops will be withdrawn and the Belgians under Colonel Thomas will continue the campaign against Naumann alone.   It is reported that Naumann is approaching Mwanza.The General Officer Commanding has reported that the Belgian authorities cannot furnish sufficient carriers for their column now operating with the British. He believes that the Belgian civil authorities in the Congo do not wish to provide carriers from that State, being under the erroneous impression that they can be obtained from those portions of German East Africa now in Belgian occupation. The British Government have therefore expressed their earnest hope that the Belgian Government will allow the carriers to be supplied, from the Congo, in order to meet the immediate necessities of the Belgian troops.PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.The British Consul at Lorenzo Marques has expressed the view that the Governor-General of Portuguese East Africa will accord greater opportunities for recruiting-carriers in Nyasa and Mozambique, but will probably require the recruiting to be done by Portuguese officials. As this would be undesirable, he suggests that the Portuguese Government should be pressed in the matter, hut he considers that British recruiters might be accompanied by Portuguese officials.JAMAICA.The Governor of Jamaica has telegraphed, in reply to the enquiry about the recruits from Colon and Panama,1 that clothing and equipment will have to be sent to Colon in the transport so that the men may receive these necessaries before they embark. It is proposed to send officers and non-commissioned officers from Jamaica and to form battalions in Colon. As an alternative the Governor suggests the possibility of the &quot; Briton &quot; proceeding direct to Colon and bringing the recruits to -Jamaica, where they could receive training and be despatched by the next available transport. In the latter case the &quot; Briton &quot; would embark the seventh contingent on arrival at Jamaica from Colon.MALAY  STATES.Abdullah II., the second brother of the late Sultan of Bahang, was proclaimed Sultan on 20th June.1 See Western and General Report for week ending 20th June 1917.
PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ALLIED COMMON AFFAIRS.Nothing has yet been decided as to the date and place of meeting for the proposed Allied Conferences. Of these the first, connected primarily with the question of Greece and the Balkans, is expected to take place on or about 15th duly ; its utility would appear to be limited, however, by the stipulations which Italy and. Russia have made as to the range of subjects open for discussion.As regards the Conference, proposed by Russia, for the purpose of discussing the Allies&apos; war aims generally and the revision of their mutually binding Treaties, Mr. Balfour has expressed his personal opinion to M. Cambon (20th June) that until the results of the first Conference are known, it is premature to fix a time and place for the second. In such a discussion of war aims and peace terms, Belgium has already claimed to be represented ; Roumania and Serbia will no doubt follow suit. In the opinion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, it seems therefore advisable to await further developments before embarking on this discussion. A despatch embodying these views has been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris.The Italian Government have expressed their wish to join in the silk-purchasing &quot;guarantee scheme arranged at the recent Conference (vide Report No. 20) ; they desire that the head purchasing Bureau should be at Alilan instead of Lyons. They have also raised a question with regard to contracts that may be concluded before the prohibition decrees are issued, holding that importations into Switzerland under such contracts should be permitted. The French Government object to the location of the head. Bureau at Milan. The British Government consider it essential, in order to prevent Germany from obtaining further supplies of Italian silk, that the prohibition should come into immediate effect, irrespective of the dates of contracts ; otherwise, the Italian dealers might dispose of the bulk of the new crop to enemy agents before the prohibition decrees are issued. Sir R. Rodd was instructed on 23rd June to represent this view strongly to the Italian Government, and to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government must decline to finance the silk industry unless explicitly reassured on the subject. On the 26th he reported that the Council of Alinisters had. dealt with the question and issued a Decree, prohibiting the export of all thrown silk, with immediate application to extend to all current contracts. This prohibition will cover all the new crops and the outstanding deliveries of last season&apos;s silk are not of serious importance. At the same time, for purposes of effective control and general convenience, the Italian Government are convinced that the only possible location for the silk purchasing Bureau is at Milan, and they appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government to join them in urging the French Government to accept this view.Mr. Grahame has been instructed (23rd J une) to request the French Government, if they agree, to appoint a French railway expert to be associated with the British Director of Railways at Salonika, to examine into the existing condition and require-ments of the Greek railways, with a view to handling the traffic that may be expected to follow upon the development of the overland route via Taranto. The Foreign.1 Office also request that the High Commissioner at Athens be instructed to arrange with the Greek authorities to provide these experts with all necessary assistance.BELGIUM.In consequence of the distress prevailing in Belgium, large numbers of&apos; Belgian workmen are voluntarily seeking employment in Germany, where it appears they can earn good wages and are given soldiers&apos; rations. In some cases workmen have been followed by their families, who also draw soldiers&apos; rations.   The Belgian Minister at
The Hague has explained to Sir W. Townley that only the immediate fear ^of starvation would have induced these people to seek shelter with the enemy, and he hoped, now that the Relief Commission are in a position to import meat and fats, that the situation may speedily improve.ITALY.In his recent speech to the Chamber, Baron Sonnino declared that Italy&apos;s sole aim in Albania is to defend her against all designs of third parties, to guarantee her full liberty in the arrangement of her internal affairs, and to vindicate her just claims and interests. It will be for the Allied Powers to determine hereafter lier frontiers and those of her neighbours. So long as the war lasts, the civil administration must necessarily be dependent on the military command, which will be inspired by all due -respect for local customs and interests. As regards Greece, he maintained that, there as elsewhere, &quot; Italy had carefully maintained complete agreement with her Allies.&quot; In the Mediterranean &quot; Italy&apos;s interests are essentially based on the principle of &quot; equilibrium and of equality between the Powers, and we have full confidence that &quot; in any event they will be equally safeguarded and guaranteed.&quot; With reference to the Petrograd peace formula, he declared that it wotild be monstrous to suppose that this formula could imply the re-inipbsition of fetters on &quot; the land of martyrs of Italian race &quot; any more than it could justify condonement of the wrongs of Belgium or the extermination of the Armenians.SWITZERLAND.M. A dor was elected Federal Councillor, in succession to M. Hoffmann, by an overwhelming majority on 26th June. He will take charge of the Foreign Depart-ment until the end of the year. From 1st January next, the former system will be restored, under which the conduct of Foreign Affairs is vested in the President.GREECE.The firm but tactful policy of the High. Commissioner has succeeded in rapidly bridging the gulf between M. Zaimis and M, Venizelos, and in bringing about a situation which promises well for the pacific restoration of unity in Greece.   On 21st June, at M. Jonnart&apos;s invitation, M. Venizelos came to Keratsini to discuss and superintend the work of the Joint Commissiou, to the formation of which M. Zaimis had also agreed.   The first duty of the Commission, as then defined by M. Jonnart, would be to weed out all undesirable elements from the Army and the   Administration;  thereafter,   upon   the   question of  the  convocation   of the Chamber of May 1915, M. Zaimis would resign, and the way would thus be open for M. Venizelos to resume the Premiership.    The  Commission was appointed on  the   21st,   consisting   of  M.  Repoulis   and   another Venizelist  Minister   on the one side, with two Athens Ministers (Justice and Finance) on the other, the High Commissioner acting as referee.   M. Jonnart informed His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires that he hoped to be able to  demand the convocation of  the  Chamber within ten days and that M. Venizelos, when officially recalled, would be accom-panied by a division of his own Army.   The French troops would be withdrawn from the Piraeus so soon as prudently possible.   On the 22nd M. Venizelos informed his colleagues at Salonika that he. would return on the 25th, fully satisfied with the position of affairs at Athens and confident that the Provisional Government would move thither in the course of the week.   Events moved faster, however, than was originally expected.   On the 24th the High Commissioner handed to iVI. Zaimis his Note calling for an early convocation of the Chamber.   In reply, the Prime Minister regretted his inability to assume the responsibility for this course and, having fulfilled the patriotic task which he undertook on King Constantine&apos;s abdication, he now desired to be relieved of office ; he would tender his resignation to the King.   At an
audierice thereupon accorded by King Alexander to M. Jonnart, it was arranged that M. Venizelos should be invited to form a Government at once. Under these circum-stances the Ministers of the -Provisional Government at Salonika were summoned to join their leader at Athens. M. Zaimis resigned on the 27th and the Venizelist Ministry was sworn in, composed as follows: Venizelos, President of Council and War ; Politis, Minister for Foreign Affairs ; Repoulis, Interior ; Admiral Coundouriotis, -Marine; Tsirimokos, Justice; Negropontis, Finance; Papanastasiou, National Economy; Dingas, Education; Embiricos, Provisions; Spiridis, Communications; Ministry of Agriculture not yet assigned.This satisfactory development of the situation is evidently due in a large measure to the elastic firmness of M. Jonnart&apos;s diplomacy and to his impartial repression of unreasonable opinions and measures on both sides. While preparing on the one hand for the return of 1V1. Venizelos to power, and recognising the necessity for an extension of the Venizelist administration in Thessaly, he has curbed the notoriously injudicious activities of the officers of the French Naval Mission at Athens by placing them under the direct orders of General Regnault, Commanding the Allied Forces at the Piraeus. He has reduced the exasperation produced by King AlexandeFs proclamation by arranging with M. Zaimis for the publication of a royal letter in which His Majesty gives guarantees for constitutional government; at the same time he has conveyed a polite intimation to His Majesty&apos;s uncles, the Princes Andrew, Nicholas and Christopher, that during the present period of reconstruction, Athens would be the better for their absence. Thus handled, the Royalist party evinces a disposition to accept the situation gracefully. On 23rd June Mr. Crackanthorpe reported that all was calm and peaceful in the Morea ; a delegate from the military officers there had even called on M. Zaimis to enquire as to the possibility of their future co-operation with the forces of M. Venizelos. On the 25th most of the officers of the Greek regiments at Athens called on M. Venizelos and assured him of their loyalty to his cause. The tone of the Athens Royalist Press is pleasingby moderate. On 2! st June the French occupation of Thessaly had been carried as far south as Lamia. (General Sarraihs communiques to the French Press on the subject, from his headquarters at Larissa, are reported to have read more like the conquest of an enemy country than a pacific temporary occupation.) On the 26th, however, M. Jounart wras able to inform Mr. Crackanthorpe that the infantry and artillery were being withdrawn to the Macedonian front, leaving only small cavalry patrols for crop-control purposes. Some noisy but unimportant demonstrations having occurred in Athens on the night of the 24th, General Regnault occupied the heights commanding the city and advanced four Russian battalions to within 2\ miles of the city in support, whereupon order was restored. The necessity for this measure, in the absence of the Greek gendarmerie, was fully appreciated by the Government, and it produced no apprehension amongst the people. It was arranged that the troops would remain in the vicinity of Athens until after the assumption of office by M. Venizelos on the 27th, that 400 Cretan gendarmes would be brought to Piraeus on the 26th, and that a ATenizelist, regiment from Salonika would arrive on or about the 29th, the Allied troops being thereafter withdrawn as speedily as possible, transport and circumstances permitting.The only disturbing feature of the situation in Greece lies in the strained relations between the French and Italian forces in the Preveza area. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Janina reported on the 20th that the Italians had outposts at Caneta (12 miles south of Janina), and the French at misc (3 miles south of Caneta), and that neither were disposed to give way. (The French detachment at misc is surrounded by Italian troops, who allow rations to pass through for *them.) On the same day Sir R. Rodd telegraphed the substance of Italian reports on the situation, maintaining that Preveza has not been occupied by Italian troops. This statement is borne out by that of His Majesty&apos;s Military Attache, who reported on the 21st that the town had been occupied by French (Senegalese) and Venizelist troops on 16th June. The new Italian line runs along the Konitza and Voyusa rivers, to a point eight miles south-west of the French post at Grevena, and thence south-west to Metsovo and Janina. Italian troops occupy the whole coast opposite Corfu and patrol the Preveza roach The Italian occupation of Janina is strongly resented by M. Venizelos and his followers ; the fact that it is believed to have taken place by invitation of M. Zaimis does not make the situation any simpler. The Italian Minister, on his side, has informed Mr. Crackanthorpe that he intends to take a strong line with M. Venizelos in this matter ; he will emphasise the3209-4 0
fact that the Italian advance into Epirus coincided naturally with the French advance into Thessaly, and he will protest against Italy&apos;s action being interpreted to the detriment of good relations between Italy and Greece. Lord Granville, having heard of the increasing excitement in Epirus and talk of a popular movement against the Italian occupation, saw the Venizelist Minister for Foreign Affairs on 23rd June and begged him to send urgent orders to all the local authorities to do everything possible to prevent a breach of the peace. The French Minister at Salonika made similar representations ; strict orders were issued in the sense desired. At the same time M. Jonnart regards the advance of the Italians in Epirus as in no way justified, like the French occupation of Thessaly, by either political reasons or military necessity. According to information supplied to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington by the Venizelist Agent, the ultimate object of the whole Italian move-ment is directly connected with the Albanian question and with their desire to extend their &quot; Protectorate &quot; to Epirus. For this purpose, says the Agent, they are endeavouring to persuade large numbers of Albanians in the United States to return to Epirus and to oust the present Greek population. According to His Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consid. at Janina, the Italian Consul at that town, whose policy is frankly anti-Venizelist, informed a deputation of the Liberal party on 21st June, that the occupation was intended to be purely Italian, and that if they did not wish to accept responsibility for preventing any Liberal movement in Epirus, they were at liberty to leave the place. Proclamations to this effect were posted by the Colonel Commanding at Janina and by General Ferrero. commanding the 16th Army Corps in Albania. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in Paris and Koine have been instructed (27th June) to urge that steps be taken to secure the evacuation of Epirus, both by the French and the Italian forces, so soon as the new Government is definitely established at Athens.The Russian Provisional Government have dissented and dissociated themselves from the policy of the Allies, which the Socialist Press describes as an unwarrantable inter-ference in the internal affairs of Greece. The Minister for Foreign Affairs complained to His Majesty&apos;s representative at Petrograd on the 21st that Russia had not been treated with sufficient ^consideration ; he was particularly annoyed that the High Commissioner should continue to speak in the name of the three protecting Powers without having obtained Russia&apos;s consent. He entirely disapproved of the weakening of the Salonika front and its effect on the Serbians. Under these circumstances, the Russian Minister at Athens was directed (20th June) to request M. Jonnart to have the Russian contingent sent back from Piraeus to the Macedonian front. On the following clay the Russian Minister was instructed to absent himself from Greece on leave.SERBIA.The Serbian Government, being informed that certain units have been withdrawn from the Salonika front, and being alarmed at this weakening of the Allied forces, have made enquiries through their Legation in London as to the real intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Greece and desire to be informed whether further withdrawals of troops are contemplated. On 27th June the Serbian Minister in London, under instructions, formally requested that a Serbian delegate should be invited to attend the impending Allied Conference to discuss the policy of the Allies in the Balkans.Sir C. des Graz reported on 21st June the result of the appeal in the military conspiracy trial, namely, that seven of the accused were condemned to death and three, of whom General Popovitch is one, to twenty years&apos; hard labour. The Govern-ment wrere considering the question of advising the King to commute the death sentence in certain cases ; the Ministers of the Interior and of War returned from Salonika to Corfu to discuss and finally decide the matter. Before their arrival, however (22nd June) three Ministers, representing the Young Radical and Progressive parties, resigned to mark their disapproval of the severity of the sentences. His Majesty&apos;s Government, communicating on the subject with His Majesty&apos;s repre-sentative at Retrograd on the 21st, observed that intervention was not possible as the accused had had a full and open trial; but the Foreign Office had reason to believe that the death sentences would be remitted. On the 23rd a new&apos; Ministry was formed, composed of members of the party of the Prime Minister (Old Radicals). The latter informed Sir C. des Graz confidentially that four of the death sentences would be commuted. It is now reported that three officers, including Colonel Dragutin Dimitrievitch, were executed at Salonika on the 26th.
BULGARIA.. Sir W7 Townley has been informed, on good authority, that Ring FerdinancPs recent visit to Berlin was intended to -promote the Bulgarian scheme for making a common frontier with Hungary hy the annexation of the Serbian wedge between the two countries, which lies on the eastern side of the Morava valley. It appears that whilst Hungary agrees to,the scheme, Austria objects, for the reason that, if it were to materialise, Bulgaria, Hungary and Turkey might make common cause politically and Hungary would thus become the stronger partner in the Dual Monarchy. King-Ferdinand is said to be endeavouring to secure the support of Bavaria and Saxony by means of promises in the matter of the Ludwig and Elbe-Danube Canals.GERMAN AFFAIRS.Information supplied to Sir W. Townley by a Dutch mechanical expert who recently returned to Holland from extended travels in Germany indicates the steady growth of a feeling of nervous depression in official circles, and anxious unrest amongst the working classes. Idle latter have lost all faith in the military genius of Hindenburg, but they still believe in the ultimate victory of the U boat. The Bress of 20th and 22nd June publishes articles forecasting a further reduction of the meat ration at an early date.Germany is reducing her heavy financial liabilities in Holland by making a payment of 20 million marks in gold to the Netherlands Bank (23rd June).The KaisePs recent speech to the Brandenburg regiment, welcomed abroad as a candid confession of Germany&apos;s deliberate preparation for war, has not escaped severe criticism at home. The &quot; Mannheimer Volkstimme &quot; (Social Democrat organ) observes that, even if the Emperor intended his remarks to be those of a soldier addressing soldiers, the fact remains that he cannot divest them of the political significance which necessarily attaches to his utterances. &quot; One has only to imagine &quot; the impression which such remarks, if made by an enemy, would create in Germany, &quot; to realise what their effect must be abroad, and how injurious to our cause.&quot; To which the &quot; Deutsche Jngeszeitung &quot; replies that what the Kaiser may choose to say to his troops is not a matter for Social Democrat criticism.Opinions in Germany as to the future of Alsace-Lorraine continue to reflect wide differences and conflicting aims. No definite agreement has yet been reached on the lines of the solution discussed by the Chancellor and Herr Hertling for the partition of the Reichsland (vide Report No. 17). Objections have since been raised in Brussia and also in the Southern Federal States against the proposed addition of Alsace and part of Lorraine to the territory of Bavaria. It is now proposed that Lorraine should be added to Prussia simultaneously with a &quot; rectification&quot; of the frontier as a sop to PTance. In other epiarters, influenced by the importance of the colonial and post bellnm trade question, there is talk of surrendering Alsace-Lorraine to France in return for a colony of equal value (vide also under &quot; Peace Discussions &quot;).AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.A German official wireless of .the 26th reports that the new Austrian Cabinet will he composed as follows : Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture, von Seidler, hitherto Minister for Agriculture ; Minister for the Interior, Count Toggenburg, hitherto Governor of the Tyrol ; Minister for Instruction, Cwikenski; Minister for Justice, Schauer; Minister for Finance, Wimmer ; Minister of Commerce, Mataja ; Minister of Public Works, Plomann ; Railway Minister, Bauhaus. All these Ministers have hitherto been heads of departments at their respective Ministries. The Minister for Home Defence is Field Marshal Lieutenant Czapp. The Food. Controller, Hoefer, remains at his post. The Prime Minister, von Seidler, at a conference with the leaders of the parties, stated that the new administration is provisional and will be replaced later by a permanent Government. He appealed for the support of all parties.HOLLAND.Sir W. Townley, under instructions, has again asked for the Dutch Governments answer to the British Governments representations in regard to the transport through Holland of German sand, gravel and other materials for Belgium (vide Report No. 16). The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied (20th June) that the matter is being most carefully investigated and has formed the subject of urgent representations, to
Berlin&quot;, the Dutch Government stating that they can no   longer accept German assurances that the materials in question are required for non-military purposes.The Dutch Government seem to have trusted to luck, and to the possibility of inattention in England, with regard to their proposed export of potatoes to Germany. They quite realise that it involves a violation of their agricultural produce agreement with Great Britain, but seem to have hoped that it would not be regarded as serious. Unofficially they have admitted that the trouble was caused by the Germans threatening to cut off Holland&apos;s coal supply if they did. not get the potatoes. On 23rd J une at Rotterdam a crowd, consisting chiefly of women, made an attack upon some barges loaded with potatoes awaiting export to the United Kingdom. The Dutch authorities had been warned against bringing these barges to the section of the port situated in the centre of the town ; the fact that this warning was neglected appears to His Majesty&apos;s Minister to justify the suspicion that a deliberate attempt is being made to stir up animosity against Great Britain. On 27th June the Foreign Office directed Sir W. Townley to address a communication to the Dutch Press, emphasising the fact that Holland is under no obligation to supply England with potatoes so long as she refrains from sending any to Germany.SWEDEN.During his brief stay at Stockholm, on his way home from Russia, M. Thomas had a conversation with the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, who laid great stress on SwedeiFs difficulties in the matter of speedily obtaining, in good condition, her supplies of grain purchased in the United States. He emphasised also the country V lack of raw- materials requisite for the maintenance of its industries. In regard to the. latter point, M. Thomas observed that if Sweden needs raw materials, it is for the Swedish Government to persuade Swedish shipowners not to lay up their vessels ; he pointed out that only 30 ships had left Sweden since 1st April.With reference to the releasing of grain ships in American ports, His Majesty&apos;s Government, having fully considered ail the circumstances, are now of opinion that the passage of the British shipping from the Baltic must necessarily cover a much longer period than was originally anticipated. They have therefore proposed to modify the Kogrund agreement in Sweden&apos;s favour by releasing the 12 grain ships now at United States ports or Halifax, at the rate of three a&apos;week, without reference to the egress.of British ships from the Baltic. If cargoes are shown to be deteriorating at Halifax their clearance will be exrjedited. In return, they will expect the Swedish Government to grant free transit for goods to and from Russia. Sir E. Howard, telegraphing on the 25th, earnestly deprecates the addition of the entirely new condition to the terms recorded in the Kogrund. Agreement; firstly, because the undertaking to allow the grain cargoes to come forward was conditional only on the free passage of British ships from the Baltic; and secondly, because there is every-reason to expect that the United States will independently require Sweden to grant free Russian transit. (He suggests, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government might possibly and rightly, as a subsidiary condition, require Sweden to resume transmission of the British, parcel post, improperly suspended.) Finally, he transmits a renewed request from the Swedish Government that all the grain ships should be allowed to proceed without further delay, as in several cases their cargoes are known to be deteriorating, and, if the damage extends, will have to be unloaded. For reasons explained to His Majesty&apos;s Minister by the Foreign Office on 27th June, His majesty&apos;s Government adhere to their instructions, which have been fully discussed with the Swedish Minister in London.Referring to the opinions expressed in Norway that the Baron Rautenfels affair may lead to war with Germany, Sir E. Howard observes that whilst all classes in Sweden will make every effort to keep out of it, the feeling is growing that the force of circumstances may be such as to compel Sweden eventually to take part in the Avar, and in that event she Avould not, be on the German side. There is no doubt that the widespread indignation of the Avorkiug classes against German brutalities would find, clearer expression were it not generally recognised that the country is absolutely at the mercy of German airship raids. All things considered, His majesty&apos;s Minister inclines to the belief that Sweden will maintain her neutrality unless Germany compels her to abandon it by some overt act of hostility. On 25th June the Stockholm Press dealt at great length Avith the Christiania plot. The &quot; Social Democraten &quot; said that it would arouse horror and resentment throughout Sweden, and added &quot; how long will it be before the German people themselves protest against such.vile acts committed in the name of Germany? &quot;   On the following day,
however, all comments ceased, obviously by order of the authorities. A Russian Press correspondent at Stockholm informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister that his telegram to Petrogr&apos;ad on the subject had been severely cut down by the Swedish censor.NOP WAY.The Norwegian Government are similarly influenced by consideration of the risks to which the country would be exposed in the absence of effective defence against aircraft raids. They fear that one immediate result would be the wholesale destruction of forests. Sir R. Paget observes in this connection that an Allied attack on Germany&apos;s forests might be timely and useful.The main facts concerning the semi-ofhcial German explosives-importing business of Baron von Rautenfels have been published in the Norwegian and foreign Press. Sir M. .Findlay&apos;s despatches on the subject contain, however, certain additional information. The bombs imported by the Baron from Berlin were provided with clockwork mechanism capable of producing an explosion at any time within Id days ; recent unexplained explosions on ships trading between Norway and Great Britain are, therefore, naturally ascribed to this officially directed German plot. The only case found unopened amongst the Baroibs &quot; luggage &quot; was fastened with the seal of the German Ministry for Foreign Affairs and addressed to the German Legation in Christiania. The German Minister was invited to be present at its opening; he declined to attend, but protested vigorously against the breaking of the seals. This case contained 55 bombs. The Norwegian Minister for National Defence thought the whole consignment (consisting of about a ton of explosives and bombs) was meant for use on the British ships coming from the Baltic.The passport of Baron von Rautenfels showed him to be an Imperial German messenger ; the official nature of his murderous business is confirmed by the German Ministers efforts to secure his release and objection to his imprisonment as a breach of international law. Sir M. Findlay thought it possible that the Germans would endeavour to induce the Norwegian Government to release him in return for the release of the crew of S.S. &quot;Thorunn&quot;; but he regarded such a transaction as improbable in view of the strength of public opinion. On 21st June His Majesty&apos;s Minister was informed that the German Minister (who professed complete ignorance of the plot) had asked to be replaced. On the 23rd his successor was appointed from Berlin in the person of the notorious Yon Hintze, organiser in China of the expedition &apos; against the Siberian Railway in 1915.The Russian Government have instructed their representative at Christiania to request the Norwegian Government to adopt decisive measures against the German establishment and use of submarine bases in Norwegian territorial waters. It has been observed that the periodically increased activity of German submarines in the Arctic Ocean coincides with the arrival of the German kerosene ship &quot; Sylvia &quot; in Norwegian arctic ports. This ship is frequently stationed at Vardo. His Majesty&apos;s Minister has suggested to his Russian colleague that, in making representations on this subject, he should avoid making any reflections on the zeal and efficiency of the Norwegian Navy, which would not be justified.Referring to the position of the coal and tonnage negotiations, as outlined in last week&apos;s Report, His Majesty&apos;s Government concur in Sir M. Findlay&apos;s opinion that a formal agreement on the shipping question is unnecessary, and that, provided certain final details are arranged, the terms of agreement recorded in. the correspondence should prove sufficient. Control over vessels owned or chartered by the Norwegian Shirjowners&apos; Association will be exercised by means of a s.ystem of revised, bunker conditions, it being understood that the Association will disapprove of all charters not previously approved by the Inter-Allied Chartering Executive.DENMARK.The Danish delegates, representing commercial, shipping and agricultural interests, have concluded their negotiations and returned to Denmark. The general result of these negotiations is unsatisfactory. In view of the tonnage situation and other considerations His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore decided not to afford3209-4 I)
facilities for any further importations of fodder and cereals into Denmark beyond cargoes already afloat or navieerted ; of which decision the United States Government was notified on 22nd June, with a request for co-operation. It has also been decided to cut off Denmark&apos;s supplies of margarine-making materials, in order that the Danes may thus be led to consume more of their butter and have less for export to Germany. In this connection Sir Pi. Paget states that M. Andersen has requested him (26th June) to inform His Majesty&apos;s Government that during negotiations in Berlin on their homeward journey, the Danish delegates were pressed to concede half their agricultural output to Germany on the ground that Germany buys the produce at much higher prices, and sells coal to Denmark at much lower prices, than England. This demand was refused, M. Andersen considers that in justice to the loyalty of the Danish farmers, His Majesty&apos;s Government should make it possible for them to decrease their production gradually.As regards Danish produce, the delegates proposed to maintain the present rate of exports to the United Kingdom if His Majesty&apos;s Government would, refund the cost of freight and insurance from Bergen to Hull. In reply the Foreign Office has pointed out that this proposal is in principle similar to that of the bonus system which His Majesty&apos;s Government originally offered, but that neither bonus nor refund would be justifiable, in view of the heavy expenditure involved, unless it were accompanied by a definite limitation of Danish exports to Germany. (The bonus offered would have subsidised Danish agriculture to the extent of over 4 millions sterling per annum on the 19.16 basis.) It is now understood that the Danish GoA-ernment have accepted Germany&apos;s offer to give immunity from attack to produce boats outside tlie danger zone in return for an additional export of 10,000 horses in 1917.As regards the shipping negotiations, it has been agreed that the Danes will supply 200,000 tons of shipping for service in the Anglo-French, and Anglo-Italian trades, in return for the British Governments undertaking to license 100,000 tons of coal per month for export to Denmark in Danish ships. The delegates held it to be undesirable, for political reasons, to make any specific agreement as to the amount of Danish tonnage to be allocated for Allied trades in distant waters, but gave a general undertaking, Avhich secures to Allied trades all Danish vessels of over 500 tons not actually required for Danish home-trade purposes.SPAIN.Sir A. Hardinge reported on 21st June that the internal situation appeared to be calmer; there had been no further manifestations of insubordination in the rank and file of the Army. The Prime Minister is of opinion that the Army is not associated with the Republican movement, but the Military Committees will probably insist upon certain changes being made in the King&apos;s personal entourage. A. political strike, con-nected with the revolutionary most^ement, is expected to take place on 1st July. On the 25th of June the Government decided to suspend the constitutional guarantees, but Sir A. Plardinge thinks that the measure is one of general precaution, and not intended to meet any definitely threatening danger. In a recent despatch (12th June) IBs Majesty&apos;s Ambassador expressed the opinion that the most serious element in the present situation is the personal position of the King ; he is able and patriotic, but changeable and easily influenced. For instance, the effect of the collapse of Russia on his mind was such as to make him hedge in a pro-German direction ; he therefore threw over Coimt Romanones and the Cortina agreement and gave his confidence to the Democratic party. But that party Avas unable to check the discontent, created by the Palace camarilla&apos;s interference, in the Army ; it remains to be seen whether -the new Conservative Ministry will be able to persuade him to leave civil and military patronage to his Constitutional Advisers.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador is informed that the Spanish Government are disposed to make a satisfactory settlement of the commercial questions now at issue with Great Britain.Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to request the United States Government to support His Majesty&apos;s Governments representations at Madrid on the subject of the continued activities of German submarines in Spanish territorial waters. Sir A. Hardinge recently warned the Spanish Government that unless they can find means to put a stop to these outrages, Great Britain will claim similar freedom of action within the limits of Spanish sovereignity, besides reserving the question of
ultimate compensation. On 20th June a vessel was torpedoed within 2.V miles of the shore at Cape Ortegal and. on. the 21st a Danish steamer was sunk a mile further in Shore.Notwithstanding these outrages, the Spanish Government have declined to intern, the German submarine (UC 52) which put into Cadiz in a damaged condition on 11th June. In reply to Sir A. Hardinge&apos;s representations on the subject they allege G) (21st June) that expert examination has proved, that the damage is confined to her machinery and was not inflicted by hostile action. Under these circumstances, the Spanish authorities have allowed her until 29th June to complete her repairs. The French Government, who at first warned Spain that the release of this vessel would be regarded as an unfriendly act, now think that it might be agreed to, on. the under-standing that the submarine undertakes to return directly to Germany and that the Spanish Government agree to close their ports in future to all belligerent submarines. His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion, however, that the matter is much too serious for any compromise and have instructed Sir A. Hardinge (27th. June) to protest strongly and on broad lines, against the attitude and action of the Spanish Govern-ment. The general argument to be adopted is that the Germans are not entitled to claim the hospitality of: neutral ports under international law, because their submarines are flagrantly and brutally violating the laws of civilised warfare.PORTUGAL.The Portuguese Government find themselves unable to accede to the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the ex-enemy ships handed, over to Great Britain under the agreement of last Jufy should be placed under the British flag. Such action, besides being opposed to international lav/, would arouse much opposition in Portugal. In order, however, to put an end to the delays and inconvenience caused by indiscipline and inefficiency in their crews, and to ensure the profitable use of these vessels, the Portuguese Government have decided to send a competent naval officer to England who will settle disputes and make such changes in the composition of the crews as may be required.As the result of a conference between the Foreign Office and the Portuguese Minister (19th June), revised conditions were agreed to, subject to confirmation hy the Portuguese Government, in regard to the loan (2,6OO,0OOL) to be made to Portugal . against the security of the above-mentioned vessels. The Portuguese Government is to pay 5 per cent, interest on the loan and 5 per cent, annually towards sinking fund ; expenditure to be restricted to purposes approved by the Treasury, and any sums due to the Wheat Commission to be a first charge on the loan.CHINA.After the dissolution of Parliament, General Chang Hsrin and Li Ching-hsi, the Premier-elect, came to Peking. Mr. Alston then reported that differences had arisen between Chang Hsun and the military Governors, some of whom were opposed to Li Ching-hsi&apos;s assumption of the Premiership, and declined to withdraw their troops until a Cabinet had been formed to their liking. On the 22nd, these difficulties had been overcome, and on the 24th Li Ching-hsi assumed office as Premier and Minister of Finance. In a lengthy telegram to the civil and military Governors of the provinces he explained, however, that he had accepted office against his own washes and for a period not to exceed three months.Anticipating the early formation of a Chinese Ministry commanding general, acceptance, His Majesty&apos;s Government, consider that the moment is opportune for the Allies to decide on the terms of the offer to be made to China, with a view to inducing her to declare war against Germany. Such an offer would assuredly strengthen the hands of the Chinese Government and contribute to its stability. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokio has therefore been instructed to request the Japanese Government to reconsider their decision in this matter and to agree to the joint&apos; presentation of an offer at Peking on the lines suggested by His M.ajesty&apos;s Government in May (vide Report No. 16).m[SIAM.Sir E. Dering points out that if and when the German vessels at Bangkok are seized hy the Siamese Government, the Japanese will expect to participate in.any
arrangements made as to their disposal, on grounds of previous joint action when the-question of chartering was under discussion.As regards the price eventually payable to. the Siamese Government for these vessels, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir E. Dering that the-amount of Siamese funds in Germany, liable to be confiscated in the event of a rupture, is about 720.000Z. The terms of purchase proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government would be less than this amount by 30,000L His Majesty&apos;s Minister suggests that the amount might be covered by the sale or hire to Allied firms of the German-owned, barges, tugs and lighters at Bangkok.ECUADOR.&apos;His Majesty&apos;s representative at Quito reports that an American Company, having made a private and apparently unauthorised agreement with the owner of Albemarle Island (about 700 miles north-west of Guayaquil), for the development of the island&apos;s mineral and agricultural resources, has been prevented by the Ecuador Government from proceeding with, the enterprise. An American steamer, carrying the outfit for the expeditionary Company, was refused clearance at Guayaquil, and has discharged her cargo at that port. The President of the Republic intends to visit the island and investigate the matter; there is much public feeling on the subject, and&apos; the Government are being denounced, in spite of their repudiation of all knowledge of the agreement.UNITED   STATES.The Food. Control. Bill has been passed by the House of Representatives and is now before the Senate. The Food Controllers powers will thereby be , defined and established.Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to inform the American Government of the nature and purpose of the Military Service convention, now in process of arrangement between the British and Russian Governments, and to state that Plis Majestyds Government are anxious, if possible, to conclude a similar convention with the United States. Such an agreement, imposing a reciprocal liability on British subjects in the United States and on United States citizens in Great Britain, would involve legislation to give the United States Government the necessary powers. Irishmen and Colonials would be excluded from, the scope of the proposed, agreement.The scheme for the organisation of a Polish, army appears to have undergone certain important changes at the centre of the movement in the United States. When the idea was first discussed with Mr. BalfouFs Mission, the intention was that the Polish, force should be recruited in America as part of the United States army, but with distinctive national insignia. The present plan is to give the Polish army a national status and to connect it with the establishment of a Provisional Polish Government, an arrangement which, in the opinion of Plis Majesty&apos;s, Government, appears inadvisable on account of the endless opportunities it would present for friction and delay.The necessity is steadily increasing for effective co-operation in blockade measures against neutrals on the part of the United States. Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to point out that the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government are to some extent tied by the definite agreements which they were compelled to conclude with neutrals, faute de mieux, before the United States became a belligerent. These agreements, and the compromises&apos; they involve, were in fact frequently necessitated by the attitude of the United States as a neutral. It is not possible for Great Britain to violate them ; but His Majesty&apos;s Government desire that the United States Government should realise the situation thus created and accept the assurance that, in urging the United States to bring new pressure to bear in blockade measures, His Majesty&apos;s Government are not asking them to do anything which they would not do themselves, had not their freedom of action been limited by the agreements in question. The need for immediate remedial action is proved by the difficulty7 in which Great Britain has recently been placed by7 reason of the exorbitant terms demanded by molybdenite mineowners in Norway, encouraged by German competition for their product; the Norwegian Government are now similarly endeavouring to exploit the situation in the matter of the Fish agreement.
THE SHIPPING SITUATION.Thinking that the High Commissioner at Athens may possibly be unaware of the seriousness of the tonnage problem, His Majesty&apos;s Government have requested that he may be apprised of the situation by the French Government, and requested to make no concessions to the Greek Government which would involve the employment in Greek service of any vessels over and above the number required to meet the country&apos;s urgent necessities.The Swedish Government have informed Sir E. Howard that, in order to sail under the German safe-conduct of 1st July, all neutral ships must be painted in a certain way, and they learn, that difficulties have been raised by the British authorities op the ground that there is not enough paint to meet the requirements of all the vessels that will need it. Sir E. Howard observes that, if any vessels are lost to Sweden as the result of a refusal to supply paint in British ports, the pro-German Press will certainly make the most of the fact. In reply, His Majesty&apos;s Government have stated (27th J une) that everything possible will be done to supply the paint required, but in view of the short notice given it may not be possible to do so at all ports.His Majesty&apos;s Government have requested the Admiralty to allow all neutral vessels that have cleared and wish to sail on 1st July, to leave harbour, even in cases where the port may have been officially closed to traffic ; it being understood that the master of the ship takes the consequent risks. This arrangement is made to prevent the Swedish Government from possibly misinterpreting any precautionary detention of vessels as a breach of faith.In the case of goods destined for neutral countries that may have been sunk or captured by the enemy, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided, and taken steps to notify the countries concerned, that captured cargoes must be treated as forming part of the agreed ration of the country of destination, and that no undertaking can be given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to facilitate the replacing of cargoes sunk. If concessions are made in individual cases, fresh guarantees or certificates must be furnished by the importer or association concerned.The German Government have offered to make compensation for the Butch vessels sunk in the Channel on 22nd February by transferring to Butch shipowners certain German vessels now lying in the Butch East Indies. The Dutch Government desire to ascertain whether the Allied Governments will recognise the change of flag. In the opinion of Sir W. Townley, the German-inspired section of the Dutch Press anticipates that recognition will be refused, and is preparing public opinion to put the blame on England.Referring to an application by the Vacuum Oil Company to charter an American ship to carry lubricants to Holland, His Majesty&apos;s Government have directed Sir C. Spring Rice to point out to the State Department that, in view of the scarcity of tonnage, it is most undesirable that any American vessels should be chartered for traffic to Scandinavia or Holland.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.The Scheidemann and David ,peace-doves have returned to the German ark without comfortable messages for the Fatherland. Nevertheless, the &quot; Ivolnische Zeitung &quot; gives them its blessing and credit for having preserved as good Germans &apos;; the national sense and the State character.&quot; &quot; It would be a national misfortune,&quot; says the Government organ, &quot; if the Stockholm brew were presented to us as a German peace. &quot; What Herr Scheidemann and Herr David have left behind for Herr Branting and &quot; for those who wish to go on discussing the possibility of a settlement, bears the &quot; mark of its Socialist origin, but it is certainly not of a nature to expose its.&quot;- Herr Scheidemann evidently shares this opinion, since he considered it necessary to say something on his return to justify his mission in the eyes of Social Democracy as distinct from Bureaucracy. His apologia in the &quot; Vorwarts&quot; amounts to a confession of failure ; there runs through it, moreover, a note of bitter and possibly sincere conviction with regard to germany moral and political humiliation. &quot; Abroad,&quot; lie says, &quot;we hear the Fatherland cursed on all sides, consigned to the &quot;lowest depths of hell as the stronghold of the blackest reaction, whilst England,3209-4 Jt]
&quot; France, and America are landed as bearers of light and. freedom to the world.&quot; He then proceeds to blame the Government for not frankly7 accepting the Socialist peace formula of no annexations and no indemnities, denounces the idea of making such a peace with Russia alone, and generally repudiates all responsibility for the increasing difficulties produced by the Government policy. Finally, he declares, the sense of futility led him in Stockholm to the unalterable conviction that &quot;nothing can be done &quot; until Germany is completely democratised. It is not our enemies, but our friends &quot; (alas, there are so few of them out there !) who keep on telling us that the time has &quot; come to change our own political conditions, and prove to the world at large that &quot; the gulf between it and ourselves is not so wide after all that it cannot be bridged.&quot; As a means to hastening the end of the war he therefore advocates a popular movement, regardless of parties, to secure the immediate and. thorough reform of the German constitution on a democratic basis.Her r David has delivered himself in the &quot;Social Demokraten &quot;. in reply to the criticisms of M. Thomas on the German Socialists&apos; Memorandum. His remarks on the subject of Alsace-Lorraine are of interest: &quot; Our Memorandum repeats what was &quot; unanimously resolved by the Party Committee in 1913, as to the German iuterpre-&quot; tation of the understanding between Alsace-Lorraine and German Social Democracy. &quot; It points to the fact that this ruling on the Alsace-Lorraine question was in the &quot; nature of an inner political question within the German Empire ; this was admitted &quot; at the time by the Freuch party. The agreement which took place between French &quot; and German parliamentarians in the Berne and Bale negotiations was based upon &quot; this understanding. When, at Whitsuntide 1914, I took leave of M. Thomas in &quot; Bale, I was fully convinced that no misunderstanding on the question of Alsace-&apos; &quot; Lorraine would ever come between us ; but to-day he has abandoned the agreement &quot; which we arrived at before the war.&quot;On 20th June the American Legation at Stockholm published a statement, telegraphed from Washington, to the effect that the news of the arrival of American delegates at Stockholm (vide last Report) had created much surprise in the United States, inasmuch as the refusal of passports for Socialist delegates had been approved by public opinion, and the organisations to which these individuals belong are not in any sense representative of labour in the United States. Neither Davidovitch nor Goldfarb are American citizens. The programme which these &quot; delegates &quot; suggested as a basis for the Internationalist Socialist Conference gives little evidence of clear thinking. It suggests a referendum as the best means of determining the future government and frontiers of Roland and Alsace-Lorraine ; it would propose the establishment of Balkan United States and the United States of Europe.The International Socialist Conference, summoned by the Betrograd Sovyet, was to have met on 28th dune. On the .22nd M. Chkheidze sent a telegram inviting the Hungarian Socialist leaders to attend it. On the 26th, however, the SovyeFs Bureau at Stockholm announced that &quot;in accordance with the wishes of our French &quot; comrades, who cannot arrive in time, the Conference is postponed. When &quot; arrangements have been made with the French and other parties, a new date will &quot; be announced.&quot;Lord Bertie learns on good authority that Monsieur Caillaux is the instigator of the pacifist propaganda, of discreetly pro-German tendency, which is being carried on by a newly established journal called &quot; Le Pays.&quot; He is planning the creation of a &quot; Ligue Republicaine &quot; and desires to address a public meeting at the Trocadero, but this will probably be forbidden, as likely to lead to /hsorder.GENERAL.In the opinion of the French Government, expressed to Lord Bertie (23rd June), there are many7 objections to direct relations between representatives of the Allies and German officials; they therefore regard with misgiving Lord Newton&apos;s mission to The Hague. His Majesty&apos;s Government have explained that it was not considered possible to decline the meeting in view of the importance attached to the question of securing better treatment for prisoners of war. At the same time, the AVar Cabinet has instructed Lord Newton and his colleagues that they are not authorised to conclude any arrangements without reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that their duties are limited to hearing and discussing the proposals put forward by the German delegates.The Netherlands Minister at Berlin has been requested to make inspection and report (1) as to the conditions of life at the Claustal, Sirvecken, and Sell warms tadt
camps ; (2) as to the alleged employment and bad treatment at lubeck  Docks of some 300 British prisoners belonging to the mercantile marine ; (3) as to the breaking up of the officers&apos; camp at Crefeld.The French Government have now agreed to hand back to the British authorities the 1,500 German prisoners lent to them for work on the hay harvest; this restitution was rendered necessary by the fact that the Germans had sent a number of British prisoners to Poland and Russia under conditions of great hardship in retaliation for the non-transfer of German prisoners to England.Lord Bertie reports that the French are still holding up parcels addressed to German prisoners of war and hope that, as the result of these reprisals, the Germans will soon cease from so doing. Recent evidence of the confiscation of tinned goods and soap from English parcels, by order of the German Government, has been forwarded to Lord Newton&apos;s mission.As a result of the arrangements discussed at Berne, through Swiss intermediaries, between the French and German Governments, a draft agreement has now been concluded for the exchange of privates and non-commissioned officers, and for the internment in Switzerland of officers, who have been over 18 months in captivity. The number of French prisoners in Germany is estimated at 350,000, of whom 240,000 have been 18 months in captivity, as against 205,000 Germans in France, of whom 70,000 have been 18 months in captivity. The agreement stipulates that under no circumstances shall exchanged prisoners be employed again at the front or in the army zones. His Majesty&apos;s Government, discussing this arrangement, have pointed out the diastrous results which might follow if a similar exchange were arranged by Austria with Russia, where both sides hold about 1,300,000 prisoners. M. Ribot considers it very unlikely that the Russians will negotiate such an agreement, which he admits would be objectionable ; should they show a desire to do so, it would be for the Entente Ambassadors to dissuade them.
APPENDIXTOWestern and General Report No. 22.-    &apos;)))THE  NATIONALIST PARTY IN SOUTH AFRICA  AND  the republican  CAMPAIGN.. It is not easy to estimate the significance of the recent debate in the South. African House of Assembly upon Mr. MerrimaiPs Resolution1 condemning the propaganda in favour of Republicanism, without some consideration being given to the attitude adopted by the Nationalist Party towards the campaign for an independent republic in South Africa.The Nationalist Party.It should first be noted that, prior to the General Election of October 1915, the Nationalist Party in the House of Assembly consisted of about 12 members. They were then led, as they are now, by General Hertzog, who had been obliged to retire from his membership of General Botha&apos;s Cabinet and thereupon adopted a hostile attitude towards the Prime Minister and his followers of the South African Party. At the General Election the Nationalists contested 16 seats in the Orange Free State Province and won them all; they contested 33 in the Cape Province and won 7, 37 in the Transvaal Province and Avon 4, and 5 in Natal Province Avhere they did not succeed in Avinning any. Their strength thus rose to 27, as against 52 members supporting General Botha, and 39 Unionists.2 The rest of the House was made up of 4 Labour and 5 Independent representatives.It is quite clear, as stated by General Smuts.3 that the object of the Rebellion was independence, and he was able to show that the Rebellion had been AArorked. up by German intrigue and rested on the prospect of German support. As to Iioav far the Nationalist Barty Avere responsible or implicated, it is not easy to determine with precision, but it appears from the Report on the outbreak of the Rebellion4 that Maritz Avas Avorking for General Hertzog and the Nationalist Barty ill the TransA^aal before the European War broke out, and that this rebel leader made free use of General PIertzog&apos;s name in connection Avith the rebel movement.The Doctrine of Neutrality.Idle more recent attitude of General Hertzog and the Nationalists towards the idea of independence is dealt with below, but from the first stage of the present war General Hertzog has not hesitated to proclaim that it is perfectly Avithin the right of South Africa, or indeed of any Dominion, to declare its neutrality in the case of a Avar undertaken by Great Britain of which it does not approve. The Nationalist leader explained his view of the difference between the position of the Dominions and that of foreign countries in the folloAving words : &quot; By neutrality for the Dominions is &quot; certainly not meant the neutrality of a totally independent country, such as Holland &quot; or Denmark, but nevertheless in substance it is the same, though less embracing, &quot; and certainly does include the right of abstaining from taking part in a war in &quot; which Great Britain is involved. The reasons Avhy our Ministers maintain the &quot; contrary is because of their Imperialistic proclivities, and their desire to minimise &quot; as much as possible the extent to which we stand to lose our rights and liberties. &quot; The right of neutrality must be maintained, or the Dominions wilL demand- their &quot; independence.&quot;51 See Western and. General Report for week ending 20th June under heading South &quot; Africa.&quot; &apos;-&apos; For war purposes the Unionists are now supporting General Botha. 8 3rd March 1915. &quot; U.G. No. 10-&quot;15. r&apos; 12th February 1917.
General Botha had pointed out from, the very first1 that &quot; the British Government being involved in war, the Union of South Africa is also ipso facto in the same state. &quot; As an integral portion of the British Empire you cannot remain neutral, and if you &quot; want to remain neutral you will have to separate from the British Empire.&quot; Later2 he spoke even more emphatically when he said, &quot;I hope the Nationalists do not want &quot; the Crerman flag, but they want to be neutral and that is a most dangerous policy. &quot; It is a declaration of war against the British Empire.&quot;The Transvaal Nationalists&apos; Manifesto.Recent opportunity has been taken by the Nationalist Party of the Transvaal (of which Mr. Tielman Roos is Chairman) to refer to the declaration which occurred in the Allies&apos; Reply to Germany (termed by the Nationalists &quot; Great Britaihs Note to neutral powers &quot;) that no peace is possible until reparation has been made for violated rights and liberties and until the principle of nationalties and the free3 existence of small States is acknowledged. The statement in the manifesto upon this declaration contained the following passage : &quot;As the honour of Great Britain &quot; is bound up with these exalted proposals, it is naturally impossible under the one &quot; or the other conditioner on the ground of the one or the other argument, to exclude &quot; the former South African Republic or the Orange Free State from the application &quot; thereof, in view of their existence as independent States having been ended by &quot; Great Britain herself by the act of conquest of 1902,&quot; and continued, &quot;we take &quot; the responsibility of declaring on behalf of our fellow citizens that we should &quot; accept joyfully and thankfully the retrocession of our independence, and we &quot; williugly acknowledge that if such a retrocession be immediately brought into &quot; being by Great Britain before it is brought forward as a contra-effort during a &quot; peace conference, then proof would be given without any question to the whole &quot; world that Great Britain in the application of the principle of the restoration of &quot; conquered States was only inspired by honourable motives, and would for ever be &quot; armed against the suspicion that hypocritical reservations lay at the root of her &quot; demands.&quot;In explaining this manifesto a little later,4 Mr. Tielman Roos stated that it called upon England to fulfil her proclaimed principle of restoring small nations by giving back the Republics. He stated, &quot; The ideal of Afrikanders is the establishment of a United States of South Africa on constitutional lines.&quot;The demand for independence as set up in the Transvaal Nationalist Alanifesto was subsequently stated to refer only to the portions of South Africa represented by the Provinces of the Transvaal and Orange Free State. &quot; We have not asked for independence for the whole Union,&quot; said Mr. Tielman Roos, &quot; because the arguments therefor are not as incontestable as those for Transvaal and Free State independence,&quot; but he agreed that independence for the whole Union would be &quot; the best course.&quot;The Nationalists and Independence.It is to be observed in connection with this Manifesto that in the programme of principles laid clown by the Nationalist Party in the official Constitution accepted at the Nationalist Congress in 1916, the Party asserted that it &quot;unequivocally accepts &quot; the position of the Union in regard to its connection with the United Kingdom, &quot; resting as it does on the good faith of the two nations.&quot; It would therefore seem that the policy of the Nationalist Party as a whole is inconsistent with the Manifesto of its Transvaal Branch.General Hertzog, however, in commenting upon the Manifesto of the Party Executive of the Transvaal, said4 : &quot;A great deal of fuss has been made about this &quot; note, but as far as I can see, this note merely asserts an incontrovertible fact, namely, &quot; that the burghers of the late Transvaal Republic would be prepared to accept &quot; independence if offered by Great Britain, in terms of what seem to be the tenor and &quot; spirit of the British Note. As far as the Free State is concerned, I have no hesitation &quot; in saying that, if such an offer were made to the Free State, the Free Staters would &quot;accept it with gratitude,&quot; and he declared he had &quot;sufficient confidence in the1 12th September 1914. - 24th January 1917.3 In quoting the extract from the Allied Note tlie Nationalist Party use the word, &quot;independent &quot; or onafhankelik.&quot; 12th February 1917.3209-4 . F
&quot; Prime Minister of England to leave this question until the proper time has arrived, &quot; when I have no doubt Jdreat Britain will act according to what is contemplated by &quot; the British Note.&apos;&apos;&apos;The attitude of General Botha towards the Manifesto was given in these words1: : &quot; The question put before the people is, &apos; Bo you want your republic back or do you &quot; &apos; want to remain under the British flag?&apos; . . . rChe manifesto is a slim &quot; document it is drafted with the intention of misleading the people, and the &quot; impression created is that the Nationalists stand for the independence of the &quot; country, but that the South African Party is against it ... Why are not &quot; the Nationalists honest and say straightforwardly that they stand for a &quot; Republic?&quot;Upon this point General Hertzog observed2 that it had been said that he had spoken of.the flag of a future Republic, but &quot; whether I shall ever see that I doubt very much. I am afraid that I am not young enough for that.&quot; In the same speech he explained his position with regard to independence, in which he took the following somewhat technical line : &quot;It is not quite clear to me why we may not even lay claim to &quot; &apos; independence &apos; without being denounced as disloyal. As I have already said, we &quot; are certainly independent of Great Britain as a country and as a dominion. On the &quot; contrary, we are certainly &apos; dependent,&apos; as far as the King of England, as our &quot; Sovereign Lord, is concerned. Yet in that respect we are in exactly the same &quot; position as the United Kingdom and the people of Great Britain are they are also &quot; &apos; dependent,&apos; as far as the King of England is concerned, notwithstanding which &quot; they are called &apos; independent.&apos; Why not we ? &quot; . . General Pfertzog also laid emphasis on the point of Kingship, and after calling attention to the words of the Treaty of Yereeniging said : &quot; You see therefore that at Vereeniging we expressed &quot; the desire to acknowledge Pfis Majesty King Edward VII. as our 1 lawful sovereign &apos; &quot; -not &apos; to become part of the British Empire.&apos; &quot;Realising the subtle danger of the Nationalist campaign and the attempt made to win votes at the Brovincial Council Elections by appealing to the sentiment for independent nationality still possessed by many of the Boers, General Botha has issued3 a grave warning to his own Barty followers in the JYansvaal. In this he says :-&quot; Members of the South African Party must not allow themselves to be misled by false aud misleading propaganda for independence . . . The proposal is wholly impracticable, and is, moreover, very dangerous, for in the present war conditions it can only lead to bitterness, division, race hatred, and even to civil war . . . My warning is intended very earnestly, because I foresee in this movement nothing but ruin for South Africa and disastrous consequences for the South African people.&quot;dhtE Debate in the PTouse.It was in circumstances such as those outlined above that the debate took place in the Union Plouse of Assembly upon the Resolution of Mr. Merriman. This affirmed that the House, viewdng with alarm the Republican propaganda being carried on in the country, desired to record its opinion that such manifestations were at variance with the Constitution and must inevitably lead to fatal dissensions and the ultimate ruin of the European race in South Africa.Mr. Merriman stated that while the Nationalist propaganda was regarded lightly by educated people, it was different in country districts, where there wras a deliberate movement to destroy the Constitirtion in favour of a Republican form of Government.A Nationalist Amendment was moved to this Resolution, which regretted that efforts should be made to create the impression that the natural aspirations of the inhabitants regarding independence were disloyal and unlawful, and General Hertzog argued that there was nothing in the Constitution or the Treaty of Vereeniging which was opposed to his conducting a pro-Republican propaganda, and he asked, why Republicanism shordd not he discussed in South Africa as freely as in England. He added that he was theoretically a Republican, but that he did not advocate a Republic to-day because he fully realised that they could only hope to make a Republic a success when all sections unanimously asked Great Britain for independence.4th May 1.917.2 5th May 1917.3 June 1917.
With reference to the idea of an independent Republic, the leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Cresswell) ashed the Nationalists to contemplate a strong Germany stretching across the Continent with harbours and submarine bases and a huge native population trained as black soldiers in a mercenary army. He asked how long South Africa would then enjoy the freedom it had to-day.General Botha on the last point emphasised the fact that since the Union had received its Constitution, the British Government had never on a single occasion interfered with South Africa.1 He further pointed out that not a word had been uttered by the Free State delegates to the National Convention about a Constitution on Republican lines ; while the leader of the Unionists (Sir Thomas Smartt) stated in regard to the National Convention that the English minority had relied on the good faith of the Dutch majority. Sir Thomas Smartt expressed himself in. favour of rigorous measures if this propaganda continued.As already announced2, Mr. Merriman&apos;s Resolution was carried by 72 votes to 21, the minority consisting wholly of Nationalists.Further Discussion of Nationalist Position.General Botha amplified the position he had adopted in the Debate in the course of a speech he delivered a few days later,3 when he said : &quot; I believe in maintaining &quot; the link between South Africa and Great Britain. You cannot destroy this link &quot; without a bloody civil war. All this talk of liberty sounds very well, but you &quot; cannot create a Republic unless the two races agree. And is it possible that &quot; Englishmen in South Africa will have a Republic ? You will do nothing but arouse &quot; suspicion by talk like this.&quot;In emphasising that South Africa was a &quot; sister State &quot; of Great Britain, the Union Premier declared that &quot; its first duty, in the interest of the Union itself, is to remain &quot;on a friendly footing in the British Empire without giving up any of the principles &quot; of South Africa. It must always be seen that South Africa&apos;s interests are to secure &quot; the Constitutional connection between the Union and Great Britain. But for the &quot; British fleet we should have been in the greatest difficulties.&quot;Commenting on the Nationalist gains during the Provincial Council elections, General Botha said : &quot; The fact of the Nationalists winning a few seats will not scare &quot; me. Six seats have been won in the Cape, the majorities of which only total 1,350, &quot; while there are 55,000 Union voters at the front, who surely are not Nationalists.&quot;It would appear that opinion amongst the Nationalists on the question of Republicanism is not unanimous. A Nationalist Congress to discuss the matter has been summoned to meet in the Orange Free State Province in August next, but it is to be observed that Dr. Malan, the leader of the Cape Nationalists (who has made two unsuccessful attempts to enter Parliament) has advised his followers in the leading articles appearing recently in the chief Nationalist organ, &quot; De Burger,&quot; that they should not attend this Congress.1 Commenting on the recent criticism of &quot; De Burger,&quot; the Nationalist organ, concerning the Imperial War Cabinet, the &quot; Cape Times &quot; stated &quot; The Prime Minister of, England has expressly &quot; declared that the War Council involves no interference with Dominion rights. . . . No consti-&quot; tutional change is involved nor can it be involved in that Council. . . . Yet &apos; De Burger,&apos; in its &quot; desire to raise bogies to frighten its readers, cites this act of spontaneous goodwill, this proof of the &quot; Mother Country&apos;s desire to recognise the equal status of the Dominions with herself, as an encroachment &quot; on South African liberties.&quot;* See Western and General Report for week ending 20th June 1917.3 23rd June 1917.
