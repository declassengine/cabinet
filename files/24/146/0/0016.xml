APPRECIATION  OF TEE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT, No.  16.Aij st I! alia n C 0 m m 0 n w e a [,ti-i.The prompt response of the Commonwealth to the Admiralty suggestion that three more vessels&apos; of the Royal Australian Navy should be sent to European waters is typical of Australia^ readiness to use her naval forces in the best interests of the common defence.Italy.The Italian coal crisis is still the most serious immediate consequence of the submarine campaign, as it involves the whole question of Italy&apos;s capacity&apos; to continue effective active operations this summer.Greece.The new policy in Greece has now been definitely fixed.. The difficulty ahead will be how to initiate it most effectively. A sudden invasion of Thessaly by General sarrail&apos;s troops may be the-most successful way of anticipating local resistance, but will, almost certainly lead to an outbreak at Athens. On the other hand, any inti-mation given at Athens of the intended seizure of the harvest may give the Greeks time to move troops back from the Morea. The Zaimis Government will no doubt fall, possibly to be succeeded by a military Government under General Dousmanis.G icr man A pea its.The polic.y of the Paris Resolutions is being fully justified by the evident terror of Germany at the prospect of a future, world boycott of her trade. The advantage of this weapon of economic menace is that Germany has no effective reply to it, and that mere prolonging the war only makes the matter worse. There can be little doubt that, even failing definite military success on the Western Front, the Allies can always secure the evacuation of Belgium and Northern France in exchange for reasonable guarantees that the world will not be wholly closed to German trade, without being compelled to have recourse to the disastrous expedient of re-establishing Germany in her Colonial bases.Meanwhile, as regards the immediate question of Germany&apos;s territorial aims, the Chancellor, by his adroit speech, has quieted the storm in a teacup between Socialists and annexationists which, incidentally, he has probably found quite useful in bringing his Austro-Hungarian colleague into line.Spain.Bethmann-Hollweg&apos;s flattery of Spain in his speech, and the Spanish Governments attitude over the German violation of Spanish territorial waters, make it clear that Spain is definitely committed against a breach with Germany under any circumstances.
Japan.The excitement in Russia over the possibility of Japanese intervention against Russia if the latter makes a separate peace is significant. That Japan means to make prompt use in the Far East of every development of the Russian situation is obvious, but there is no real indication yet of the steps she may be intending to take.Without further knowledge, the volte face of the Japanese Government in China is inexplicable, since it declines to give open support to the Chinese Premier for an anti-German policy in which he has every right and reason to expect material assistance from the Allies. It may be due to the effect of the recent elections or to intelligent anticipation of closer r-elations between Great Britain and the United States in the Far East. In any case the prestige of the Allies must suffer and their good faith be open to attack, if (at a stage which the Japanese admit to be critical) the Premier is left without the support which the other Entente Powers desire and propose to give him, The situation is not improved by the cynical suggestion that if the Premier is beaten and disorder ensues. Japan is prepared to assist financially in its suppression. It would seem to be better policy to finance the prevention of disorder.United States.It is clear that from the very necessities of the case the intimacy of Anglo-American co-operation is increasing every day, and that the original American plan of waging war, against Germany, but not in alliance with the Entente Powers, is breaking down. On the other hand there is still a good deal of marking time, due to the lack of real interest in the war, and possibly to a belief that it may be over before the American forces can come into action.L. S. A.17th May 1917.

PART L-RRITISH EMPIRE AND  AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.The Commonwealth have nominated an expert representative to serve upon the Committee which is being set up to work out the constitution and functions of the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau.&apos;GENERAL.-The Secretary of: State lias informed the Governments of British Guiana, Trinidad, Barbados, Leeward and Windward Isles and Malta that in consequence of the critical situation relating to food supply it has become necessary to prevent all exports of food from the United Kingdom and also such imports as are not absolutely essential. In this way it is intended that the shipping available for the transport of munitions and. necessary food may be increased.The Governments of the Australian Commonwealth and. of Ce^don, Straits Settle-ments, &amp;o, have been informed that on account of the submarine menace in the Mediterranean the Shipping Controller is reducing the service of the Peninsular and Oriental Company to India to one ship per fortnight. The Australian and Far Eastern services by the Mediterranean route will be temporarily abandoned in favour of the route via the Cape. The mails for Australasia will go either on the last-named route or via North America, and the Commonwealth have agreed to despatch their homeward mails by such routes.The policy already adopted by the United Kingdom, Canada and. New Zealand of licensing only those exports to Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland which are carried in ships owned by the country of ultimate destination, has been also adopted by South Africa.CANADA.The Shipping Controller is desirous of ascertaining the steps that have been taken by the Dominion to requisition the ships which are under construction in Canadian yards for neutral Powers. It is understood that a vessel being built for Norway has been sold to the United States, and. though there is no objection to the delivery of those vessels to America which have already been purchased for war purposes, the Shipping Controller would desire that vessels under construction should be allocated to the United Kingdom before they can be obtained by any other country.The Governor-General has been asked to arrange witli the British Ambassador at Washington for the representation of Canada at. the Washington Labour Conference.AUSTRALIAN COMMON WEALTH.The number of troops under training on. 30th April 1917 was as follows :  Officers    -----       314 Other ranks ... -   19,74420,058On account of the submarine danger, the Admiralty have asked the Common-wealth Government to send the Australian destroyers &quot; Yarra,&quot; &quot; Paramatta,&quot; and &quot; Warrego &quot; for service in European waters. In expressing their cordial agreement to the proposal, which they feel confident has been made after a full consideration of dangers in Australian waters, the Ministers enquire if the Commonwealth destroyers at present at Singapore will be sent to Australian waters.&apos; 1 See Western and General Report tor week ending Oth May 1917.
In response to the suggestion to that effect1 the British Government have agreed to pay the balance due upon their wheat purchases in weekly instalments of 1,000,0001. each-commencing 1st September. This arrangement will be subject to adjustment in regard to interest.The Referendum on the proposed abolition of the Queensland Upper House has been allowed by the Commonwealth High Court, but without prejudice to the legal point being decided later. The Governor of Queensland reports that the voting up to the present indicates that the proposal will be rejected, but complete results will not be known for some months.&apos; An important suggestion for meeting the submarine danger in so far as the transport of flour is concerned has been made by the Prime Minister of the Common-wealth as based on experiments. He states that ships made of pinewood do not founder, even if water has reached the hatches, while bags of flour, with material anchored to them exceeding their own weight, will, after remaining 48 hours in salt water, rise to the surface on the anchorage being removed. They will then both float themselves and also possess enough buoyancy to keep afloat material of a certain weight. When the bags are opened, the major portion of the flour will be found to be dry. Upon this the suggestion is based for the construction of wooden ships loaded with 40 percent, of flour, as if such vessels were hit by torpedoes it is believed they could remain afloat sufficiently long to enable them to drive off the submarines with their gun-fire, and to procure sufficient assistance to save most of the flour. It is added that Australia can fill with flour every ship that can be sent to transport it.With reference to the suggestion made to the Australian Government that as much flour as possible should be milled and stored,1&apos; the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has asked for power to substitute flour for wheat up to the full amount, or at any rate up to half, of the contract. By this means it. is expected that the output of flour would be considerably enlarged, and at the same time the space occupied on the ships would be reduced by about 30 per cent. The Prime Minister assumes that the British Government will pay a reasonable proportion of the cost of storage.The Shipping Controller has called the attention of the Commonwealth Govern-ment to the grave position with regard to shipping arising from the submarine campaign. Alter referring to the net losses, and the number of ships allocated to the Allies, the Controller points out that there are 320 steamers (of 1,600 tons gross and over) of 1,100,000 tons gross on the registers of the Dominions, and of these 117, of 413,600 tons, are registered in Australia. As imports into the United Kingdom wdll be reduced from the pre-war figure of about 60,000,000 tons to possibly 25,000,000 tons this yeai^ there is great apprehension of a disastrous result unless the strongest measures are taken. Australian Aiiuisters are therefore asked again to look into the shipping situation with a view to putting more vessels at the disposal of the British authorities.NEW ZEALAND.With regard to the suggestion of the New Zealand Government that they should continue the restriction upon the exportation of newspapers to the United States for another three months,1 the Secretary of State has telegraphed that the restrictions should be continued if thought essential. It is pointed out, however, that if the legislative authority for the proposed course refers only to &quot;neutral countries,&quot; some modification of existing arrangements should be adopted, as aiiy new enactments would give rise to the suggestion that the American regulations were not efficient.SOUTH . AFRICA.The Army Council have suggested the raising in South Africa of twenty-five Reserve Parks, consisting of European (75 per cent.) and Cape coloured personnel for service in France. In view of the utility of Cape boys for animal transport, the Army Council consider that their employment in the direction indicated, after the necessary reinforcements have beerf supplied to East Africa and to the Labour Battalions and Horse Transport Unit in France, would be valuable, as there is much difficulty in obtaining drivers. It is pointed out that service under fire may be necessary.1 See Western, and General -Report tor week ending 2nd May 1917. - See Western and General Report for week ending 9tli May 1917.
oThe Secretary of State has informed the Governor-General that for military reasons the Army Council have decided to recall General Hoskins from the command in East Africa. General Van Deventer has been invited to assume this command, with the temporary rank of Lieutenant-General, and the invitation has been accepted.Exact information as to the reported massacres of Jews in Palestine us asked for &quot;by the Union Ministry as the representatives of the Jewish faith in South Africa are evincing much anxiety regarding the position.RHODESIA.The Government of Northern Rhodesia have called attention, to the undesirability of keeping natives as carriers beyond the time for which they enlisted, and this has been put before General Northey. Owing to the urgency of keeping up a full supply of carriers it may be necessary to retain some of them in this manner, but the Secretary of State Jias expressed the hope that they may be set free directly substitutes are sent to replace them. - ,In order to meet the demand for 0,000 carriers for German East Africa, a system, of compulsion has been adopted in Rhodesia. The British South Africa Company consider that there are objections to the course that has been thus found necessary, and have enquired whether every effort to secure recruits on a voluntary basis has yet been made in Nyasaland, or, failing success in that direction, whether compulsion might not be introduced there.NYASALAND.The Governor reports that there are some 200 white German prisoners, both officers and men, at Blantyre, and owing to lack of transport facilities it is not possible to send them to British East Africa. As the German advance into Portuguese East Africa has brought them in close proximity to the eastern border of Nyasaland, it is considered important to move these prisoners, more especially as there are about 850 black prisoners at Zomba. It has therefore been suggested to the South African Government that the white prisoners should be sent via Beira to South Africa and be kept in the Union territory till other arrangements are made.LIBERIA.While welcoming the decision of the Liberian Government to sever diplomatic relations with. Germany, the United States GoArernment pointed out the desirability of taking no action in the matter until some ships could be at hand to afford protection to the inhabitants, should this become necessary on account of the number of Germans in Liberia. The British Admiralty therefore despatched a ship to Monrovia, and Liberia definitely severed relations on 8th May. Immediately afterwards Liberian soldiers conducted a search of German houses for arms and ammunition, and a certain amount was seized without opposition. The President of the Republic has assured the British Consul-General that there is no expectation of trouble, after the departure of the warship, from the German residents of Avhom there are about 70 in Monrovia and 30 at other coast ports.The French wireless station at Monrovia will be re-opened.CEYLON.In response to the enquiry of the Army Council,1 the Governor states that about 1,700 men from the Colony are on active service. The remaining fit men of military age (not including clergy, police and necessary railwaymen) is estimated at 1,300, but it is not considered possible to spare many of these. For this and other reasons the idea of setting up a Commission to enquire into the cases of fit men is not thought of any value. It is added that the Government are still paying the passages of men who wish to volunteer for active service. ^1 See Western and General Report for week ending 9tli May 1917.2962-2B
PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ITALY.On L!th May the Foreign Office learned that owing to the action or inaction of the Italian Government it would probably be necessary to postpone the Conference which, as stated in last week&apos;s Report, was due to meet in Paris on the 14tb. The Conference having been arranged to discuss not only the question of silk exports to the enemy, but other connected questions of blockade policy or of military importance, Sir R. Rodd was instructed to urge upon the Italian Government the serious consequences that must be entailed by further delays. He was also directed to state that, if their inaction and failure to reply to the enquiries of the British and French Government have been due to unwillingness to terminate their present silk traffic with Germany (a traffic contrary to agreement and damaging to the Allied cause), His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to discuss a considerable addition to the imports of silk into the United Kingdom to compensate for cessation of these exports to the enemy. Fully appreciating the special circumstances of the Italian silk industry, His Majesty&apos;s Government had. no desire to adopt an unreasonable attitude towards it,, but urged that the Conference should be held forthwith, as the Italian Governments avoidance of discussion had created a painful impression. Sir R. Rodd reported on the .12th that he had strongly urged the Italian Government to adhere to the date arranged ; they had explained that the postponement was clue to the fact that they desired Signer Dell&apos; Abbadessa to come to Rome for fresh instructions before the Conference, and he had been delayed in Paris by the Swiss agreement negotiations. On the 14th, the Italian Government intimated that they would be glad if the Conference could be arranged to take place at Rome between the 22nd and 30th May, and that it should be attended by Swiss, as well as by French, delegates. Considering it possible that a partial solution of the silk question might be found in. a compensating market in the United States, the Foreign Office have directed Sir C. Spring Rice to inquire whether the United States Government would be.willing to be represented at the Conference.The attitude of the Italian Government in other directions suggests a certain touchiness; in the matter of the coal supply for urgent military and industrial purposes, it would appear to arise from a distinct sense of injury and injustice. Sir C. Spring Rice reported on 10th May that the strongest pressure was being brought by the Italian Ambassador at Washington to bear upon the United States Government to induce them to supply Italy with American coal. On the 13th he added that the impression created by the representations made to the State Depart-ment was that Italy cannot obtain a fair hearing in London, and that her need of coal was most urgent; the United States were making enquiries as to the reasons for the alleged inadequate shipments from the United Kingdom. On the 14th the Italian Ambassador in London was informed that increased supplies from Great Britain are impossible, owing to shortage of tonnage, but His Majesty&apos;s Government have no objection to shipments of coal in American bottoms from the United States to Italy.Through Sir R. Rodd the Italian Government have expressed their surprise at the alleged decision, of His Majesty&apos;s Government to make a grant of two vessels for coal transport to Italy conditional upon, the conclusion of the arrangement between France and Italy for the purchase of timber in Switzerland. They question the interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this arrangement, and urge that the matter of coal transport be dealt with separately and at once.Complaints have also been made by the Italian authorities concerning the non-observance of instructions and regulations by British ships employed by the Italian Government in Italian waters.BELGIUM.On 29th April the German Government addressed a note verbale to the Dutch Legation in Berlin wherein it was asserted on the alleged authority of a submarine report, that a&quot; submarine trap &quot; had been discovered bearing the distinctive marks
of the Belgian Relief ships. Referring to this unfounded allegation, the Foreign Office requested Sir W. Townley (12th May) to inform the Netherlands Government that there is no shadow of truth in it, and added: &quot;It is merely a variation of the &quot; equally groundless assertion that the hospital ships of the Allies are used for &apos;&quot; purposes other than those sanctioned by the Hague Gonmention, and is evidently &quot; meant to serve as a pretext for torpedoing Belgian Relief ships at sight and thus &quot; further reducing the mercantile tonnage of the world.&quot;GREECE.At the Conference held, in Paris on 4th and. 5th May, the following decisions, in addition to others bearing on the military situation, were recorded (and have since been confirmed by an exchange of Notes) in regard to the position of affairs in Greece. Collectively they represent the British and French Governments&apos; recognition of the fact that the position had become impossible, owing to the conflict of policies and&apos; personalities at Athens and Salonika, and the desire of both Governments to introduce remedial measures, based on a singly-directed authority and united counsels. With this object in view, it is agreed that, for the present, France, representing the predominant military force in Greece, should assume the diplomatic lead at Athens and represent the common policy of the Allies vis-a-vis the Greek Government. Coincident with this arrangement, the present representatives of Great Britain and France at Athens will be withdrawn, Sir F. Elliot being replaced by a Charge -d&apos;affair.res or Minister of subordinate rank, and M. Guillemin by a French statesman of distinguished position, acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Italian and&apos; Russian Governments are to be invited to consider the advisability of following the British example.It will be the object of the Allies, while securing the safety of General Sarraiks Army, to gain the friendship and goodwill of the Greek people. The British and French Governments agree, as a precautionary and. protective measure, to take the necessary steps to secure control of the harvest in.Thessaly.&apos; They will inform the Greek Government that if the purchase of the crops is not obstructed the Allies will proceed to raise the blockade. The harvest is to be fairly divided between Royalist and Venizelist Greece under the direction of the International Commission, which will sit either at Athens or Larissa as the new French represezrtative may decide. In order to secure disposal of the harvest, General Sarrail will establish military control posts at Larissa, Volo, and other points in Thessaly, at the same time doing everything in his power to prevent civil.strife and to avoid complications. (In this connection Mr. Lloyd George bore testimony to the loyalty with which General Sarrail has adhered to his undertaking to take no military initiative against Greece without the -consent of the Allied Governments.) In carrying out these measures to secure control of the harvest, the French undertake not to call upon His Majesty&apos;s Government for any naval or military assistance beyond the force of 500 men. which will be detached for the purpose, and it is understood that the British naval forces at Salonika cannot be increased to establish a base at Voio. Venizelist troops will not be used at the military control posts, but should a spontaneous Venizelist movement take place in Thessaly they may be called upon to maintain order.In explaining to Sir F. Elliot these decisions (which will necessitate his return to England on leave so soon as the new French representative goes to Athens), the Foreign Office have taken occasion to convey to him an expression of the high appreciation of His Majesty&apos;s Government for his conduct of affairs at Athens during a long and trying period of unusual difficulty.Noting that it is hoped, under the diplomatic lead.of France, to secure the goodwill of the Gireek nation, Sir F. Elliot observes that M. Zaimis will probably resign when he hears of the new regime, as under it he is unlikely to effect the purpose for which he took office, viz., a reconciliation with M. Venizelos. In that event, Sir F. Elliot -thinks that a period of intensified anarchy will ensue before the French are in a position to take active measures.Lord Bertie has been requested to suggest to the French Government the advisability of: issuing a proclamation to the effect that the islands (Zante, Cerigo, Skopelos, &amp;c.) which have renounced theiFullegiance to the authorities at Athens are exempt from the restrictions imposed by the blockade.Sir F. Elliot reported on 12th May that, of the seven senior officers ordered to Morea by the Greek Government on. the 8th, three had actually left. M. Zaimis was --convinced that the rest would soon go quietly; a few days&apos; extension of time had
been granted to them. To a Trades Union deputation on the 11th he explained that the removal o^ these&apos; officers was a necessary administrative measure, and that the Government had&apos;no intention, of taking similar steps against any other persons, or to exile any citizen from Greece.M. Venizelos left Salonika on lUth May in a destroyer, to be absent about a week in Rethimo, Sitia and Candia. Lord Granville reports that, on the day before, the--French Minister at Salonika had received from his Government and had communicated to M. Venizelos information to the effect that the British and French Governments had agreed to extend the neutral zone to include all Thessaly for the purpose of controlling-the harvest; Venizelist troops were not to be used for the purpose, but all spontaneous adherences to the Provisional Government would he allowed. Lord Granville had received no instructions on the subject.M. Zaimis would prefer not to appeal to the German Government for safe-conducts for Greek wheat ships, but will do so if His Majesty&apos;s Government desire it. The Greek Government have enquired whether it would not be possible for the Allied naval authorities to give Greek ship captains a safe course to follow, and, when necessary, an escort. In reply, Sir F. Elliot was instructed, on the 14th, to state that the provision of safe-conducts for Greek vessels is a matter for the Greek Government to arrange, and one for which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept responsibility. Sailing instructions will be given to Greek captains for the voyage from Port Said to-Greece, but from Gibraltar eastwards they must follow the route prescribed, by the-German Government.According to a statement made by the French Military Governor to His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Corfu on 1.3th May, the issue of bread and foodstuffs to the Allies was. stopped on that day by General sarrail&apos;s&apos; orders. The Consul observed that, as the Greek authorities have no flour and the French will not supply them, it will Ire impossible to provide bread for over 2,000 British, subjects.The Vmuzelist scheme for the establishment of an independent Synod at Salonika is regarded by M. Zaimis as a deplorable and dangerous symptom of the tendency to perpetuate estrangement between old and new Greece.SERBIA.Replying to the enquiries addressed, to him by the Foreign Office (vide last Report) in connection with Colonel Harrisoids Memorandum on the Serbian Army, Sir C. des Graz reports that, according to the official information supplied to him by -the Prime Minister, the moral and general attitude of the troops is satisfactory. The trial of the conspirators is published and the accused have a right to appeal to-the Military Court. In his opinion, the Serbian Government can hardly be described as reactionary, inasmuch as it is a Coalition Government, including representatives of three out of the four political parties; the fourth, the Liberal, party, is considered pro-Austrian and most of its representatives have remained in Serbia.GERMAN AFFAIRS.Judging by the pessimistic tone of recent articles in the German financial and industrial Press (e.g ,.&quot; Rheinish Westphaelische Zeitung,&quot; &quot;Berliner Tageblatt,&quot; and &quot; Lokalanzeiger&quot;), a considerable section of public opinion in Germany is gradually realising the difficulties with which Germany is likely to be confronted, in re-establishing her overseas trade after the Avar. The &quot;Lokalanzeiger &quot; draws a very gloomy picture of the destruction already accomplished of the results of years of German toil in South America and elsewhere and predicts that its restoration will present almost insuperable obstacles. The &quot;Rheinish Westphaelische Zeitung&quot; observes that if England should succeed in establishing an Imperial Customs Union, the matter becomes one of the utmost gravity for Germany, &quot; for thereby a uniformly-&quot; directed economic hegemony will be created, which, by its very weight, will draw &quot; into its orbit a number of smaller States whose resources will be used to a common -&apos;&quot; end. This enormous weight, set in motion in the interests of Great Britain, will &quot; be intensified a thousandfold if America throws in her weight, joining hands with &quot; the old country for the defeatCbf the common foe. There are already strong- fj &quot; influences at work on both sides of the Atlantic seeking to find a common basis for &quot; Anglo-Saxon world domination. , . . . To all appearances we shall find &quot; ourselves in the near future confronted by most disagreeable facts, and only gradually shall we be. able to recover our position . in the world markets.   The-;
&quot; conditions of peace will present a first opportunity for so doing. Unless we succeed &quot;in extorting from England absolutely unrestricted most-favoured-nation treatment &quot;for German goods in Great Britain and the Colonies, . wo , shall find our hands &quot; forcibly tied in other directions.&quot;Sir W. Townley reports (14th May) that, with this object in view, the German Government are already organising a widespread Press campaign, sowing seeds of suspicion and discord in the industrial and commercial fields of the Entente, with a view to persuading Great Britain&apos;s Allies that her trade interests are fundamentally opposed to theirs, and thai:, when it suits her political convenience, theirs will be sacrificed.On the other hand, the tone of the Junker Press shows increasing bitterness against the Socialists&apos; and Scheidemanhs peace policy. The &quot; Deutsches Tageblatt &quot; (9th May) declares that if his peace proposals gain the day it will be at the cost of Germany and the monarchy. Prince Salm Horstmar, iu the &quot; Deutsche Zeitung,&quot; calls on Hindenburg &quot; to raise aloft the humbled banner of Kalserdom and place &quot; himself protecting-ly before the person of our Emperor-King and rally around him the &quot; great majority who believe in monarchy.&quot; The Chancellor, he declares, stands at. the parting of the ways. He must decide between a strong monarchy, with a German future for the German people, or democracy, internationalism and dependence upon Anglo-American capital. In Junker circles the idea appears to be gaining ground that Hindenburg and the Array may have to be called upon to control the increasing strength of the democratic movement. The Conservative organs declare that after the Chancellors visit to headquarters he returned with the KaisePs full confidence, proving that the official encouragement of the democratic movement was merely an authorised ballon d&apos;essai. All sections of the Press, however, appear to be sincerely convinced that the Allies are prepared to make peace if and when Germai^ so desires.The German Minister at Copenhagen returned to Ills post after a visit to Berlin in a very optimistic mood. He informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that troops in great numbers were being diverted from the Russian to the Western front, and that Germany7 hoped thus to secure a decisive victory in two months. On the other hand, there are circumstantial rumours, of extensive hospital arrangements at Libau and of a renewed German offensive against Riga.SWITZERLAND.The agreement in regard to export of Swiss cattle and collateral questions was signed at Paris on 12th May. As the result of the concluding negotiations, the number of cattle to be freely exported by Switzerland was raised to 30,000 head, and the period of the agreement was extended from December 1917 to 15th March 1918. Certain modifications in favour of the Allies were agreed to in Art. IV., which deals with Swiss exports of condensed milk, butter and cheese.The Japanese Government have forbidden the export of Japanese paper to Switzerland, but point out that Italy and France are importing this article for the manufacture of explosives and that it must rest with these countries to prevent its export to the enemy.HOLLAND.On 10th May Sir W. Townley drew the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the third time to the transport of sand and gravel from Germany to Belgium through Holland, and requested an early reply to the British Governments represen-tations in the matter. The Minister replied that it was difficult to bring it home to the German Government that the amount of these materials was excessive, in the face of the assertion that they were exclusively&apos; used for roadinaking, to the ultimate benefit of Belgium. The traffic between Antwerp and Zeebrugge had, however, been stopped. He promised to expedite enquiry into other matters complained of, such as the transit from Belgium of scrap-ifou,&apos; broken rifles and copper utensils through Dutch waterways.In this connection it is of interest to note that it has been suggested to the State Department by Mr. BalfouPs Mission that the United States Government should2962-2 c
SWEDEN.On 9th May the Swedish Government published a Press communique intimating that, as the result of the agreement concluded with Great Britain, the country&apos;s supply of cereals is assured until next harvest ; also that if the expected grain ships come safely to port there may be an increase in the present scale of rations.On the same day the Riksdag passed a Bill for far-reaching temperance reforms, which will come into effect at the end of 1918. Its main effect will be to eliminate all private interests in the sale of intoxicants, and to bring wine and heavy7 beers under the Gothenburg system, already applied to spirits.Upon the close of the Scandinavian Inter-Ministerial Conference an official communique was issued (12th May) declaring the unanimous decision of the Conference to adhere to &quot; the policy of impartial neutrality hitherto pursued by the three countries.&quot; Sir E. Howard understands that the immediate purpose of the Conference was to discuss and determine lines of common Scandinavian policy and economic co-operation during and after the war; it was also decided to endeavour to take concerted action with other neutral Governments for the protection of neutral interests when the war ends; but the peace proposals of the Socialist Conference were not discussed, nor any initiative of mediation. The Conference decided against the arming of merchant vessels.In view of the determination of the United States Government to co-operate with Great Britain in preventing the Scandinavian countries from importing anything which might be passed on to the enemy, Sir E. Howard considers that there can be little or no advantage in putting into force the Anglo-Swedish draft trade and transit agreement (vide Report No. 10), even if Sweden were willing to- ratify it, which is unlikely. He suggests, therefore, that he lie authorised to inform the Swedish Government that, owing to the changed and changing conditions of shipping and Swedish exports brought about by Germany&apos;s submarine warfare, His Majesty*s Government are not prepared to proceed further with the agreement. There-after, he would propose to make an immediate and separate settlement of the question of transit for Russia, at present in a most unsatisfactory condition. The actual congestion in Norwegian ports and stoppage of goods for Russia can only.be remedied by the liberal grant of transit licenses by the Swedish Government, so that some arrangement with them is necessary in regard to this matter.DENMARK.Referring to Mr. Andersen&apos;s pledges and personal position in the matter of Danish food exports to Germany (vide last^Jleport). both Sir R. Paget and Mr. Andersen himself have deprecated the suggestion that he could have accomplished more than he has actually done to prevent the increased exports of cattle and foodstuffs to Germany &apos;and to act generally in conformity with the assurances given by him to Lord Robert Cecil.    Sir R. Paget again   explains the difficult position in which the Danishintimate to the Dutch (Government that they intend, as part of a general policy of action concerted with the Allies, to support Great Bntain&apos;s protests against the transit of military supplies through Holland. The British Government have also explained at Washington that the reason for not bringing more definite pressure to bear on the Dutch Government is that the military authorities consider it undesirable to force them into a position where they would be compelled to become belligerents, either with or against us.Owing to the reports brought to the United States, by Americans lately in Holland, concerning the prevalence of smuggling across the frontier into Germany, the Federal War Risk Bureau has expressed suspicions in regard to the ultimate destination of certain cargoes of cotton consigned on behalf of the Netherlands Oversea Trust to Rotterdam and to Genoa, and have suggested that the Rotterdam vessel be detained for close examination and enquiry.The Minister for Foreign Affairs having asked for definite information concerning the bombs recently dropped from an aeroplane on Zieriksee, the Foreign Office directed Sir W. Townley to inform him that it has been conclusively established that they were not dropped by any British machine.
Government find themselves vis-a-vis the farmers, who are practically compelled to dispose of their cattle because of the actual and impending shortage of fodder, and. who, moreover, are not greatly impressed by the suggestion that they should make sacrifices to retain the British market, inasmuch as they have every reason to -anticipate that it will be lost to them under a system of Colonial preference. Mr. Andersen, asserts once more that, on the whole, the Danish, farmers have been very loyal to Great Britain, even to their own hurt; but he himself has been disappointed at the failure of His Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage their loyalty by affording assistance to Danish produce on the British market. He now suggests that the export of cattle might be prevented by the creation of a financially supported farmers&apos; association, to buy up stock in the case of forced sales and hold it till the end of the war.Sir R. Baget has been officially approached by the Danish Foreign Office with regard to a further attack on Denmark by the &quot; Morning Bost,&quot; in which the country&apos;s exports of lard and fats to Germany are fantastically exaggerated. His Majesty&apos;s Minister recommends that in fairness to the Danes these grossly incorrect statements should be publicly corrected.The actual figures for Danish exports to Germany in 1913 and 1916 respectively-are as follows, in tons : 1913. 1916.Bacon and. pork          -.            -            -   2,100 19,483Lard     -                                                   3,341 6,266Other fats         -            .         .          .   1,695 2,542Preserved meats         -            -             -     113 14,566The difficulties of the Danish Government are not lessened by the fact that Germany maintains that their action, in continuing to ship produce to Great Britain in Danish bottoms, is unfriendly. Mr. Andersen proposes to come to England shortly with the Shipping delegates to discuss the tonnage question and the general situation.The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir R. Paget that his Swedish colleague has promised to stop the landing of Swedish fish in Denmark, but the limitation of Danish fish exports to Germany must depend upon Denmark being able to secure a regular supply of motor oil from America.Danish and other Scandinavian workmen, attracted by the offer of high wages, are going to Germany in considerable numbers.SPAIN.Sir A. Hardinge reported on 12th May that he had reason to believe that the Spanish Government, on further consideration, would agree to ratify the Cortina agreement with a few unimportant alterations which Would enable them to dispense with submitting the Treaty for the approval of the Cortes.His Majesty&apos;s Consul telegraphed on .1.0th May reporting the sinking of two Norwegian vessels by submarines in Spanish territorial waters. On the previous day tlie French Ambassador at Madrid received instructions to make formal protest against the torpedoing in territorial waters of two Swedish vessels, and to warn the Spanish Government that in the event of any further similar attacks on neutral vessels French warships would be ordered to enter territorial waters to search for and expel enemy submarines. Sir A. Hardinge was directed to associate himself with this warning and to add that His Majesty&apos;s Government would consider such other measures as may be required to safeguard their rights as belligerents. The Spanish Government in reply to these protests have declared that they intend to protect their -sovereign rights in territorial waters, and that no belligerent activities therein by any German, or other foreign warship would be permitted. On the other hand, the Spanish Ambassador, when discussing the subject at the Foreign Office on 10th May, maintained that, beyond presenting Notes of protest, Spain could not and would not take any hostile action against Germany-under any circumstances. The Spanish nation, he said, are determined to remain neutral, come what may. On the 16th of May, Sir A. Hardinge was instructed to warn the Spanish Government that Great Britain will claim compensation in due course for the losses incurred as the result of ^enemy activities in Spanish territorial waters.
PORTUGAL.The Minister for War has gone to Prance for the purpose of inspecting the Portuguese troops there serving. He proposes thereafter to visit London to dis4cuss certain military questions with His Majesty&apos;s Government.CHINA.The Debate on the question, of war against Germany in the lower House of Parliament at Peking was informally adjourned for a few days on the 10th May,, owing to disturbances caused by pro-war demonstrations outside the House. According to the Presidents party, the demonstration was hired and organised by the Premier.In order to strengthen the PremiePs hands and to discount current rumours of a secret agreement between, his party and Japan, the United States Minister has suggested to Ids British and Japanese colleagues the advisability of making a declaration to the Chinese Government, to the effect that the Entente Powers adhere to their policy of maintaining the integrity and sovereign rights of China, and that they will not ask her for any territorial concessions or preferential, rights. Mr. Alston has informed his colleagues that he is prepared to join in such a declaration. The -Japanese Minister telegraphed, to Tokio for instructions on the 11th May. On the same day His Majesty&apos;s representatives in Paris, Rome, Petrograd and Tokio were instructed to suggest to the Governments to which they are accredited that, in order to enable the Chinese Premier to carry out his policy of declaring war against Germany, the Allied Powers should forthwith make certain definite concessions financially advantageous to China. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that the Boxer indemnity payments be remitted during the war and for five years thereafter, and that the Chinese Customs Tariff be increased by a 4.0 per cent, surtax. To this proposal the French and Italian Governments have agreed. The Russian Government have instructed their Minister at Peking to associate himself with his colleagues &quot;if the latter approve the proposals of the British Government.&quot; The Japanese Government, however, appear to consider that the &quot;constitutional struggle&quot; in China has reached a stage so critical, that, no such offer on the part of the Entente Powers could now affect it in the direction desired. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, pending discussion of the matter hy the Cabinet, informed Sir C. Greene (loth May) that in his opinion it would be better not to take sides openly with either party, but to continue to give-the Premier undemonstrative support. Should a crisis occur and disturbances follow, Jarjan would be prepared to afford him financial assistance to suppress them.The Foreign Office has informed Mr. Alston that the War Office desires to recruit an additional 10,000 coolies in Shantung. This will bring the total Chinese labour contingent to 4b,000.JAPAN.The Japanese Government have assured Sir C. Greene that they recognise the-necessity for preventing the sale of arms to Mexico, and strict supervision has been exercised to prevent any exports of munitions of war to that country from Japan.There are indications of a tentative desire on the part of the Japanese Government to avail themselves of present opportunities to effect a rapprochement, or at least a settlement of differences, with the United States.The British Governments Statutory List for Japan was withdrawn on the&apos; 11th May. With regard, however, to the confidential black lists for China and Japan, the inclusion of Japanese names therein is maintained for the present, and Sir C. Greene has been instructed to explain, to the Japanese Government the special circumstances which make it undesirable to modify this practice. Instructions will be given that no new Japanese names are to be added to these lists except by arrangement with the Japanese authorities.A Moscow newspaper has created a sensation by publishing an alleged interview with the Italian Consul-General, in which this official is reported to have declared that.
ARGENTINA.The Argentine Government has invited all the Central and South American Republics to send representatives to a Conference which they propose to hold at Buenos Aires as soon as possible. Sir,R. Tower understands that all but two have accepted. The object of the Conference, according to the Minister of Marine, is to concert a common line of: action to prevent the future isolation of the Republics, whose present position has become impossible. The Argentine Government, he added, will direct the proceedings of the Conference in a spirit of active sympathy for the cause of the Allies.Sir R. Tower, under instructions, has suggested to the Argentine Government the advisability of either requisitioning enemy vessels in Argentine waters or of trans-ferring them to the Argentine flag by purchase under conditions which would guarantee an equal amount of Argentine tonnage for service in Allied trades. The Minister of Marine sees no immediate prospect of requisitioning these ships ; but is apparently disposed to entertain the alternative proposal. The German steamers can be repaired localPy in about two months.A German wireless installation has been erected at Buenos Aires by permission of the Minister of Marine. He has assured His Majesty&apos;s Minister that it is the property of the Argentine Government and under their complete control.BP A ZIP.Senlior Pecanha, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the first reception of the Diplomatic Body on 10th May7, informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister that the Brazilian Government are most anxious that the restrictions on the importation of coffee into Great Britain be rescinded. They7 hope thus to secure a moral effect which would entail no practical consequences, as there is no tonnage available for shipments of coffee. Sir A. Peel thinks that it might be advisable to meet their wishes in this matter, on condition that they agree to settle the Marconi contract question, and suggests that he be authorised to inform the Brazilian Government that the restriction will be removed at the end of July, when the crop will have been gathered.Sir A. Peel mentions an unconfirmed report that the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs is negotiating a Treaty with the United States whereby Brazil would be guaranteed support in the event of being attacked by Argentina, and the United States would receive valuable commercial privileges. According to this report,-certain members of the Brazilian Government are opposing the Treaty on the ground that its conditions would practically place Brazil under economic bondage to the United . States.CHILE.The. Chilean Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir F. Strong that he has directed the Chilean Ambassador at Washington to intimate that it is no longer possible for Chile to block the Conference of South American Republics proposed by Argentina; therefore, if the United States Government desire to wreck it, they must take steps to do so.2962-3 Dif Russia gives up tlie war and abandons the. Allies, Japan will be allowed (by virtue of a secret treaty) to occupy all Siberia up to the Ural mountains. The interview was repudiated by the Italian and Japanese Consulates, and Sir G. Buchanan authorised the Press to deny the existence of any such treaty or of any arrangement between the Allies and Japan for bringing pressure to bear on Russia. In this connection it is of interest to note that, according to a confidential report forwarded by His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tokio last month, the Japanese Ambassador at Petrograd had been instructed some time previously to convey a distinct warning to the Russian Govern-in ent in the sense that Japan would expect her to fulfil her obligations to the Allies, and that, if necessary, pressure might be brought to bear to secure this end. The Moscow journaFs &quot;interview&quot; may possibly be a reverberation of the warning thus conveyed to the Russian Government.
-    -  &quot; &apos;       MEXICO.The Commercial Attache in charge of His Majesty&apos;s Legation has reported that on the 15th instant the Mexican Government presented a written demand on the Banco Internacional Hipotecario, calling upon them to hand over to the Mexican Treasury the sum of 225,000 silver pesos. No- reason or excuse is offered for this piratical proceeding. In this connection the French Minister in Mexico has now expressed concurrence in the opinion held by Mr. Thurstan, namely, that the Allied Governments would be well advised, under existing circumstances, to withdraw their diplomatic representatives from Mexico, or to allow them to absent themselves. He considers that if they remain, helpless spectators of the spoliation of their country-men, the result must be loss of dignity for the Allies and increased prestige for Germany. Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed (IGth May) that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the situation as serious and would be glad to concert with the United States Government remedial measures of an effective kind.CUBA.On the night of 9th May, a dynamite bomb was discovered at the Palace, evidently intended to blow up the President. It was timed to explode at the hour at which the United States Minister usually pays his daily visit. Mr. Leech has been directed to congratulate the President on his escape.The United States Government have sent a warship to Santiago for the protection of American interests.HAYTLCongress has unanimously voted against declaring war against Germany, but has authorised the Administration to adopt a policy of benevolent neutrality towardst the United States and to break off diplomatic relations with. Germany hereafter, should, occasion arise.GUATEMALA.The position of the German Minister in Guatemala is not a happy one. On 12th May he decided to avail himself of the safe conduct offered by His i\(ajesty&apos;s representative to return to Germany via New York. On the following clay he received orders from his Government not to return to Europe, but to make for San Salvador. The Guatemalan Government thereupon requested, the United States Minister to provide him with a safe conduct for San Salvador, but this was refused by order of the State Department at Washington, who will only grant safe conduct to the United States.UNITED STATES.The problem of the Allies&apos; wheat supply is under discussion at &quot;Washington by representatives of American, Canadian and British interests. Mr. Hoover recommends immediate legislation in. the United States and Canada to secure national purchase of all grain and control of all elevators, but the Secretary of Agriculture considers this policy impracticable. Mr. Hoover believes that if Great Britain were to prohibit the use of barley for brewing during the war, similar steps would be taken in the United States, which would increase the food supply by a million tons of barley.On 12th May Sir C. Spring Rice announced that the Trading with the Enemy Bill, fairly drastic in its provisions, had been drafted for submission to Congress. The attitude of the Administration is favourable to the measures therein contemplated, but it is difficult to forecast the policy of Congress. The effect of this legislation, combined with prohibition of exports^jhould result in practically putting an end to the trading activities of &quot; listed &quot; firms in South America and elsewhere. His Majesty&apos;s Embassy has supplied the State Department with a detailed memorandum, showing the general economic conditions of the several neutral European countries and suggesting measures of greater or less rationing pressure applicable in. each case. As regards the financial blockade, the absence of organisation and legal powers has
created some confusion and delay in the helpful measures proposed by the State Department and Treasury.Sir C. Spring Rice has drawn the attention of the Foreign Office to an article recently published in certain Few York papers which gave a grossly. misleading account of the work clone by Morgans as purchasing agents for the Allies and of the profits which the firm has made. In this article it was alleged that the firm&apos;s buying commissions have ranged from 3 to 12-i- per cent. Because these attacks are political in their origin and directed against the Administration at Washington, and also because the Ambassador considers that His Majesty&apos;s Government should publicly recognise the very valuable and timely services rendered by the house of Morgan, he recommends that a statement be now made in reply to a question in the Bouse of Commons (ami preferably by the Prime Minister) to the effect that Morgan&apos;s inclusive commission has been 1 per cent, and that their services are highly appreciated by the Allies.SHIPPING SITUATION.Having reference to the enquiries raised by the United States Shipping Board concerning the actual sacrifices of trade and shipping interests made by Great Britain and the Allies, the Foreign Office has supplied Sir C. Spring Rice with a detailed reply to these enquiries. The purpose of this document is to show that the action taken by His Afajesty&apos;s Government in regard to the use of British shipping has been framed and directed solely with a view to the successful prosecution of the war and without regard to any of the trade interests concerned. From the facts and figures cited, it appears that, as the result of the pressure gradually exercised during the past two years, practically every available vessel has either been requisitioned for direct Covernment service or has been diverted from distant employment to the carriage of essential commodities to the United Kingdom.With a view to bringing such pressure to bear on Scandinavia and other neutrals as shall induce them to resume the regular employment of their merchant shipping, Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to suggest to the United States that they should institute as soon as possible a licensing system controlling the export to these countries of staple commodities, such as coal, fodder, grain and petroleum. It is estimated that the amount of tonnage available, over and above the amount required for essential home trade purposes, is 250,000 tons in Denmark, 600,000 tons in Sweden, and S00,000 tons in Holland. Much of this tonnage is at present laid up; to release it for the purposes of the Allies by such pressure as the United States can thus bring to bear would be, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the greatest immediate contribution which the United States can make to the Allied cause. The licensing policy suggested is, in fact, similar to that successfully&apos; applied by His Majesty&apos;s Government on a more restricted scale in regard to coal. The pressure applicable by the United States should suffice not only to readjust the tonnage situation in favour of the Allies, but to dissuade these neutral countries from supplying the enemy with certain articles which he greatly needs, such as pyrites and fats.From Colonel House and others, Mr. Balfour learns that it is hoped that by the end of the year American shipyards will be turning out 400,000 tons of steel ships monthly iu addition to their present output, and exclusive of wooden ships. Rex^airs to the seized German vessels are being pushed forward.Sir E. Howard has received reliable information to the effect that the German Minister at Stockholm (evidently in close touch with the Swedish Government) has telegraphed to Berlin asking that the Swedish vessels released from English ports should be given safe-conduct. From this he infers that - Germany has probably undertaken that the British ships leaving the Baltic will not be attacked in Swedish territorial waters.His Majesty&apos;s representatives at Copenhagen and Stockholm have been directed to inform the Danish and Swedish Governments that, as the export of British coal to these countries depends almost entirely on their ships being sent to fetch it, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be compelled to consider the advisability of shutting down the exporting collieries in Great Britain (where supply already exceeds demand) unless they are assured that a certain nrTrhber of Danish and Swedish coal ships will come to the United Kingdom during May, June and July. Sir E. Howard, in reply, states that the Swedish shipowners who are now endeavouring to resume normal2902-2 E
sailings to Great Britain, have asked him for a definite guarantee that their vessels bringing approved cargoes will be allowed to return to Sweden with coal. If this guarantee is forthcoming, they can insure at 8 per cent. ; otherwise the rates are prohibitive.&apos;Sir M. Findlay reports, after an informal meeting with representatives -of the Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association on 13th May, that the general attitude and sentiments of tlie shipowners were not such as to encourage hopes of any early conclusion of the tonnage negotiations. The Norwegian Government is evidently unwilling to be made a party to the proposed requisitioning arrangements.His Majesty&apos;s representative at the Hague was confidentially informed on 10th May that His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to requisition all vessels flying the Dutch flag which are, in. fact, wholly or chiefly British owned. This decision to control vessels Avhich are really British has been brought about by the general shipping situation, and.by the particularly unacceptable fact that, while these vessels remain under the Dutch flag and therefore unarmed, they are exposed to unnecessary additional risks. The Foreign Office have explained to Sir YV. Townley that, as requisitioning can only be legally and properly effected when the vessels are in British waters, it, is unfortunately not possible to warn the Dutch Government of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter, as they might see lit to prevent the vessels in question from sailing to British ports.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Sir E. Howard now considers it probable that the Stockholm. Conference may lead to some serious discussion of peace terms between. Socialist representatives. Preparatory work has been begun by a Committee of Dutch-Scandinavian delegates which has arranged, to hold meetings with the German minority delegates and the Finnish within the next few days. (The members of the German majority Socialists will arrive about the 1st June.) In spite of Mr.. Branting&apos;s objections, the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee has adopted the formula &quot; no annexations, no indemnities&quot;&quot; as a basis for discussion. Mr. Branting, discussing the situation with His Majesty&apos;s Minister, expressed the hope that British and French Socialist delegates might attend the Conference. He believed that a Conference which Avould admit discussion of the causes of the war would lead to the German majority Socialists being definitely identified with German Imperialistic policy, a result which, would strengthen the position of the minority party. As to the &quot; no annexations&quot; formula, he thought the Russian Socialists would interpret it to mean that no country should be annexed against the will of its people. On. 12th May, influenced, by these arguments, Sir E. Howard and his Italian, colleague advised their respective Governments that in their opinion Socialist delegates from Allied countries should attend the Stockholm Conference if assured in advance that all who attend will condemn Germany&apos;s violation of the neutrality of Belgium, and consider as a primary condition of peace the re-establishment and indemnification of Belgium by Germany ; that, in the meanwhile, the invitation to the Conference should neither be accepted, nor definitely declined. The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir R. Rodd that he considers the proposal inopportune and sees no reason for encouraging any Socialists to go to Sweden whose avowed object is to obstruct the prosecution of the war. On the other hand, the Belgian Minister, Mr. Vandervelde, has informed the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee that he considers their activities most useful, in that they contribute to a closer knowledge of the international situation, but the Belgian Socialists, like those of the English and Frepch majority party, can take no part in a Conference with Imperialistic German Socialists.The Executive Committee of the Petrograd Council of Workmen and Soldiers have conveyed through the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires in London an expression of their hope that the British Government will permit delegates of the Independent Labour Party to accept the Committee&apos;s invitation to go to Petrograd. A similar request has been addressed to the French and Italian Governments.From a fairly reliable Continental source it is reported that the military party in Austria has been bringing pressure toiSear on the Austrian Foreign Office to negotiate for peace, and that the Bavarian Government is disposed to sympathise with this movement.   Hertling will support &quot;peace without annexations&quot; in the Bundesrath.
GENERAL.On 11th May Sir W. Townley was instructed to request the Dutch authorities to -obtain from the German Government without delay an assurance that all British prisoners of war will be withdrawn at once to the stipulated distance of 30 kilometres from the firing line on all fronts. This communication is made with especial reference to British prisoners in occupied Russian territory..The Netherlands Minister at Constantinople has been requested to apply to the Ottoman Government for permission to send representatives of his Legation to visit all camps at which British prisoners of war are interned. Permission to visit certain camps was -obtained from the Turkish Government by the United States Ambassador, but His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the visits w^ere not carried out owing to his departure from Turkey. His Majestj^s Government hope that the Dutch Minister may be able to continue the local purchase of clothing for British prisoners.The Dutch Minister at Berlin has reported, after visiting Crefeld Camp, that the prisoners there are well supplied as regards food.His Majesty&apos;s representatives at the Vatican and at Madrid have been instructed to make communication to the Pope and to the King of Spain respectively on the subject of Germany&apos;s action in torpedoing hospital ships and the reprisals taken by Great Britain for the attack on the &quot; Asturias.&quot; The intervention of the Pope and the King of Spain is suggested, with a view to preventing further German attacks on&quot; hospital ships, because, if they should occur, further reprisals by Great Britain are inevitable,and a deplorable state of affairs might then result, greatly embittering the whole subsequent course of the war.The German Chancellors ambiguous declaration on the subject of Germany&apos;s peace terms is regarded as reflecting this Austrian pressure. Shipping interests in Germany are violently opposed to the idea of &quot;peace without annexations&quot;; they insist particularly on the retention of Antwerp.
