SECRET.. APPRECIATION  OF THE  ATTACHED WESTERN&apos;  AND GENERALREPORT, No. IS.Tin-: Imperial Cabinet.The telegram to Mr. Hughes with reference to the secret papers laid before the Imperial War Cabinet is not without constitutional significance. For it implies the principle that the Imperial Cabinet is not merely an ad hoe body, existing only when in actual session, but a permanent body whose members are entitled to the fullest information on Imperial questions even if they have not been able to attend a session.Italy.The Italian Government are obviously7 very nervous at the idea that we or the &apos; French may be conducting separate peace negotiations with Austria. The fact that, for more or less-unavoidable reasons, they were not consulted in certain recent Allied decisions, more particularly in regard to Greece and Salonika, has tended to create a certain atmosphere of sensitiveness and even of suspicion. They realise that, outside of the Trentino, their own territorial aspirations are the ones which can be least easily reconciled with the principle of nationality, and are consequently alarmed lest the Allies may7 disregard Italian claims in their attempt to find a formula which may make French and British territorial claims acceptable to the Russian revolutionaries.GliKECE.The French view of the policy to be adopted in Greece has now definitely prevailed, and is to be carried out by M. Jonnart as High Commissioner representing France, Great Britain and, if they agree, Italy7 and Russia, with General Sarrail acting under his orders in all political matters. The seizure of the Thessalian crop is the first step which must lead inevitably to the collapse of the present regime and to King Constantine&apos;s abdication, or else to&apos;war with Greece.The report, if confirmed, that the Greek force which surrendered to the Germans at Kavala in September last and has since been interned in Silesia, is now behind the Bulgar lines at Monastir, may mean a great deal. It suggests the probability, so strongly insisted upon by the Serbians, that General sarrail&apos;s advance into Thessaly will be the signal for a German-Bulgarian attack upon the Monastir front with a view to assisting King Constantine, and that Colonel Hadzopoulos&apos;s force has been brought up specially7 to play the part of the vanguard of the &quot;army of liberation.&quot;SuruvtA.... The warnings as to the state of mind of the Serbian army contained in the last Appreciation are emphasised by further information with regard to the unfortunate effects both of the recent conspiracy trial and of the new Allied policy7 as regards Greece. Sir R. Rodd&apos;s suggestion that the Serbians may, if they feel themselves left in the lurch, listen to Austrian overtures, derives additional force by the downfall of Count Tisza in Hungary and his probable succession by7 Count Andrassy, Avho is believed to hold broader and more tolerant views on nationalist issues, at any rate outside the charmed circle of the Hungarian frontier.
German and Austrian Affairs.The fall of Count Tisza and the appointment as Hungarian Premier of Count Julius Andrassy, if confirmed, can only be taken as a further step in the consolidation of that &quot;Middle Europe,&quot; whose foundations were laid . by Bismarck and Andrassy&apos;s father in 1879. Andrassy is by temperament and tradition a European statesman, suited to the approaching period of reconstruction within and negotiation without, just as Tisza represents that intense but narrow Magyar chauvinism which was seen at its best in the heat of the struggle, but which is now an obstacle both to the internal and external diplomacy of the Central Powers.The inclusion of Western Galicia in Poland, and the development of Germ an-Austro-Hungarian economic unity both by an economic agreement and by the construction of a new main waterway between the Rhine and Danube V/tt the Maine, ,are pretty certainly part of the agreed programme, a Ad, as has been suggested .abovewan attempt to settle the Jugoslav question on Austro-Hungarian lines, may also be in contemplation (see Appendix to Western Report No. 11). ,-.  &amp;Spain.Sir A. Iiardinge&apos;s suggestion that a public declaration of monarchical faith by this country - might counteract the bad impression produced hi Spain, by the Russian revolution-illustrates one of the&apos; difficulties of the international, situation,-which may increase greatly in the next few months. , ,    ,&apos; &apos; &apos;. The Stockholm Coxferknce. ;The decision of all sections of French Socialists.to attend the Stockholm Socialist Conference-derives its importance from the fact that it will probably lead up to.:ia general Socialist or Labour Conference in which German, Austrian and Bulgarian Socialists will also be represented. It is difficult to see what results such a Conference, if it does take place, can have except to reveal the fact that when it comes to concrete questions, most Socialists are Nationalists at heart.- French and German Socialists will-never agree about Alsace-Lorraine, or Serbian and Bulgarian Socialists about Macedonia. Issues of this character,&apos;whether between Socialist delegates or between ambassadors of the old- school,&quot;can still &quot;only be. settled by the logic of the strickenheld. . :u.

His appointment by Parliament-does notnecessarily mean, however, that ex-Premier Than and the Military Governors, in Conference vvifl have no more to say in the matter. The manifesto by the Military-Governors mentioned in to-days press was&apos;&apos;only to be expected. . Ostensibly Tuan and his party are concerned for Chiua&apos;s international status, but in the light of all precedent their demands on the Chinese Government are likely to centre on questions of finance; The internal struggle will probably end in a compromise, for neither the President nor Parliament is in a position to resist the final arguments of the military&apos;leaders, most oi whom appear to be pledged to support Tuan.4h - n&amp;ix  ^    ;i v-!- &quot;: &apos;&quot;   &apos; b % ;   &apos;,&quot;&apos;     -        &apos; ... :    -   LAS: A.

part i.-british empire and  africa.IMPERIAL WAR  CABINET.The British Government have offered to forward to the Prime Minister of Australia a set of the secret papers that were circulated to the members of the Imperial War Cabinet daring the recent sittings. Having regard, however, to the risk of such papers being seized by a possible raider during their transit oversea, it is suggested that if Mr. Hughes is coming to England, the papers might be retained here until his arrival.The views of leading representatives of the various parties in the Dominions upon the policy of calling together the Imperial War Cabinet have been summarised in the Appendix to this Report.GENERAL.The Secretary of State has telegraphed, to the Governments of Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Newfoundland concerning the arrangements for the requisitioning of ships. It is suggested that the Government of the country where the&apos; ship&apos;s port of registry is situated should be considered the requisitioning authority. In-the event of vessels being in the territorial waters of a country of the Empire other than that in which the port of registry is located, the requisition will be conducted through the Government of that country. But in the case of vessels registered in the United Kingdom and occupied in the coastal trade of a Dominion, inter-Dominion trade, or other work which a Dominion Government considers essential, the British Government will consult the Dominion Government before requisitioning the ship ; and in the case of vessels registered in the Dominions, but employed by the United Kingdom, the Dominion Government would be expected to nonsuit the British authorities. An important stipulation is, however, made, viz., that in the last resort the wishes of the Government in whose country the vessel is registered shall prevail. The concurrence of the Dominion Governments to these suggestions is invited.The Dominion and other Governments have been informed that as the Japanese Government have prohibited trade with, enemy subjects in Japan, the Statutory List for Japan has been withdrawn, and all firms in Japan have been removed from the General Black List. The hope is expressed that the Dominions may agree to this policy, and. also exercise great discretion, in dealing with Japanese trade matters. In reply the Commonwealth,,Government have assured the British authorities that they entirely appreciate the importance of using the utmost care in relation to questions affecting Japan.CANADA.In consequence of the position in regard to food supply, the Dominion Govern-nient have decided to refuse all licences for the exportation of wheat to countries other than British or Allied.The Admiralty being desirous of obtaining 2.1 more trawlers of a similar character to the 36 trawlers now being built in Dominion yards, enquiry was made as to whether a further supply could be undertaken and, if so, when they could be delivered. The Dominion Government have, however, replied that the shipbuilding yards cannot enter upon fresh work for tins year.   They have already undertaken
work for tlie Imperial Munitions Board for 1918, and the Board are prepared to keep-them fully employed, but it is thought that the trawlers might be built in 1918 if&quot; this will meet requirements.The Dominion Minister of the Interior has reported that with reference to the great influx of gold, Canada has a mint with the largest capacity for refining raw gold in the world.   The present capacity of -the Ottawa Mint is 250,000 ozs.j or $5,000,000-per week.   Since September 1915, raw gold of the value of $225,000,000 has been received, all of which has been refined at Ottawa.A scheme for the purchase and payment of Australasian wool1 has been tele-graphed to the Dominion, under which the Canadian Government would have as their&apos; agents their Trade Commissioners in Melbourne and Auckland, through whom all orders would pass to the Australasian Wool Committees, and the Dominion would guarantee to the British Government the payment of all purchases.AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth states that in order to establish the wolfram and scheelite industries it is necessary to fix a price per unit and to assure a. market for, say, 10 years. With regard to molybdenite, he further says that there are two mines containing millions of tons of low grade ore, and this could be produced at a capital cost of 200,0001. for plant, if the duration of a satisfactory contract could be arranged.Regarding facilities in the Commonwealth for the construction of wooden ships,, the Government state that, if the labour organisations co-operate, it will be possible to&apos; build, and fit with, engiues, ships of between 2,500 and 3,500 tons deadweight. These vessels would have steel frames and wooden sheathing, and all the materials for the ships would be produced in Australia, except perhaps the boiler tubes. The Prime Minister is calling a Conference of Labour Unions regarding the matter, and it is hoped to begin the construction of the ships and engines at once.On account of the necessity of restricting the importation of tea from India and Ceylon into the United Kingdom, &quot;a large amount of tea is being stored in those places, and it has been suggested to the Commonwealth Government that the Australian tea supplies might be drawn from India and Ceylon instead of from foreign countries. To this suggestion the Government have agreed, and they wall prohibit the importation of foreign teas to Australia.The Army Council have decided that Christian Syrians may be enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force if due care is exercised regarding the inclusion of spies.NEW ZEALAND.The Governor-General reported on 24th May that the strength of the units additional to the original force were 451 officers and 12,127 men.The numbers in training amounted to 10,500, and there are 2,848 voluntary recruits not yet called up. Since the last return the prospects of voluntary recruiting have somewhat improved.The acting Prime Minister of the Dominion has expressed the great anxiety of the producers regarding ships being available for the next season&apos;s supply. There will be a considerable amount of the present seasoids output in store when the new season begins, and besides meat and cheese there are 240,000 boxes of butter ready for shipment.The Admiralty having pointed out that the entry of the United States into the war lias caused them to consider the matter of transporting New Zealand troops across North America via the Panama Canal, San Francisco or Vancouver, the Dominion Government have expressed their preference for the Panama route provided that they are assured of safety on the Pacific side and of convoy on the Atlantic. Pending the consent of the United States as to the route, the New Zealand Government are preparing three transports to sail via Panama on 9th June. After-wards they could arrange monthly sailings in conjunction with Australia in the event1 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 18tli April and 2nd May 1917.
SOUTH AFRICA.An offer of a free gift from Natal to the United Kingdom, in which tire Union Ministers concur, of 10,000 tons of potatoes and maize, for shipment in May of next year, has been conveyed to the British Government through the Mayor of Durban. The offer has been gratefully accepted and the provision of transport has been promised if the situation next May admits of it.The Union Ministers report that the recent recruiting figures for the Native Labour Contingent show a considerable diminution. Fresh efforts are to be made, but the Ministers think that the system adopted in the case of the first contingent of appoint-ing native sergeants and corporals should be again put into practice, as the present method, of appointing only native lance-corporals does not allow of natives of tribal importance being given a sufficient rank. If this change were made, it is thought many chiefs and others would endeavour to stimulate recruiting.The Army Council have agreed to the establishment of two hospitals in France for the Native Labour Contingent-one at Boulogne with 300 beds and the other at Dieppe with 500 beds.NYASALAND.As a resident of consultation between the Senior Naval Officer on Lake Tanganyika and the British Political Officer, it is recommended1 that the base of the British flotilla should be at Kigoma, as this place possesses the best harbour and is close to the railway and telegraphs, it also forms the centre of control of ports and trade routes, &amp;c.PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA,The Governor-General of South Africa reports that if the Mozambique province could be recruited for native carriers, some 15,000 might be obtained, while if the whole Nyasa province were opened for a like purpose, about 10,000 could be recruited. It is pointed, out that the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association have everything in readiness to start recruiting if the Portuguese Government will consent to extend the area. In view of the German advance into Portuguese territory, it is believed that the Germans will take the natives if the British authorities do not recruit them. It should be added that the British Minister at. Lisbon was instructed, on 23rd May to endeavour to obtain from the Portuguese Government permission to recruit for carriers north of latitude 22D.WINDWARD ISLANDS.The Governor reports to the effect that the limits of voluntary recruiting have been reached so far as obtaining men from Grenada is concerned. It is not even clear whether under this system the promised number of men can be supplied, but -certainly any further number would be out of the question. The planters have assured the Governor at a representative meeting that there are plenty of able-bodied men who decline to come forward. The Governor, therefore, asks for authority io-bring the matter of conscription, on - the lines of the Jamaica Act, before the Executive Council, and he adds the suggestion that the time has arrived for all the Crown Colonies to be put on the same basis as the Mother Country in this regard. Under conscription there would be no clifficrdty in supplying the number of men that are wanted.1 See Western and General Report for week ending 23rd May 1917.2 62-5 b of the same route being adopted by the Commonwealth. In any case the Government of the Dominion announce (26th May) that they have made arrangements to discontinue the Suez route.
PART II- FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ALLIED COMMON AFFAIRS.The Italian Government have agreed to send delegates to the &quot; Silk &quot; Conference to be held in Paris on 5th June.BELGIUM.The Belgian Government have drawn the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the prejudicial effect of the lack of tonnage on the Relief Commission^ work. As armed vessels cannot be employed in this service, the Foreign Office has suggested to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington that the occasion seems a good one for the United States to bring pressure to bear on Sweden and Holland to secure for relief work some of the many vessels which in both countries have been laid up in idleness.Mr.&apos; Hoover has accordingly advised that the United States State Department , should inform the Swedish, Dutch and Spanish Governments forthwith&apos; that they cannot expect to receive any imports from the United States unless they agree to provide 100,000 tons of shipping monthly for Relief Commission work. Of this 100.000 tons 60,000 tons would he employed in bringing cargoes from Australia.ITALY.The Italian Ambassador has expressed to the Foreign Office his uneasiness on the subject of an alleged visit by M. Briand to Berne in connection with secret proposals by Austria for a separate peace. He informed Lord Robert Cecil on 22nd May that when Signer Orlando was in Paris, M. Ribot had. asked him whether he preferred Asia Minor or Dalmatia. Lord Robert Cecil had no information, concerning M. BriancPs movements, but doubted, the accuracy of reports attributing to Austria any initiative for making a separate peace. Sir R. Hum bold, after enquiries, reports that nothing is known of the matter in Berne.The coal difficulty remains serious, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has begged Sir IP Rodd to do all. in his power to maintain the provisional arrangement by wdiich a certain amount of coal will be shipped, to Italy from the United States. The Minister of the Interior has explained to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that the chief cause of the failure of Italian and neutral shipping to bring in the supplies expected of them has been the heavy delays imposed on them by the new anti-submarine regulations. At tfie meeting between, the Minister of the Interior and the President of the Board of Trade and the Shipping Controller in London, on 11th May, the situation was fully discussed, and the Shipping Controller thereupon, promised the early dispatch of 10 extra shiploads. italy&apos;s minimum monthly requirement of coal for the manufacture of munitions and railway transport was understood to be 050,000 tons. The Foreign Office have pointed out that Great Britain is not responsible for the existing shortage ; during the period between 1st January and 6th May the Admiralry&apos;s figures show shipments amounting to 200,000 tons more than was actually promised. They have offered to assist in tiding over the present crisis with 50,000 tons to be delivered in June.GREECE.The further Conference on. Greek affairs proposed to the French by the British Government took place on 28th and 29th May. Monsieur Ribot came, accompanied, by M. Painleve, General Foch, -Monsieur Jonnart, and Admiral de Bon. The substance of the conclusions recorded (subsequently confirmed by the War Cabinet) was com-muriicated confidentially to His Majesty&apos;s representatives at Petrograd, Rome, Athens and Washington on 30th May. The Conference ageeed that General Sarrail should, he directed to proceed forthwith to establish in Thessaly the military posts required in. order to secure control of the harvest. M. Jonnart, in his capacity as High Commissioner representing the Allies, will take simultaneous steps for purchasing the crops. It is understood to be an essential condition of British co-operation in the new policy about to be introduced in the Balkans, that General Sarrail s occupation of Thessaly is to be carried out in the most conciliatory and pacific manner. In all political matters General. Sarrail will take his instructions from M. Jonnart. After the establishment of the military posts, M. Jonnart will proceed to carry out the other arrangements decided upon by the Conference for restoring the unity of Greece.
7137.In this connection it is to be noted, that the Italian Minister for. Foreign Affairs informed the French Ambassador at Rome on 28th May that the Italian Government, not having been consulted as to the new policy at Salonika, must reserve their decision in regard thereto, and to the representations of the Serbian Government.On the 28th and 29th May Sir F. Elliot reported rumours of French movements of concentration. . On the 28th M. Zaimis had received -word from the local Authorities in the North that a French division with artillery had arrived at Serfidje and a considerable body of their troops atdvaterina.From an official source inclose, touch with the leaders of the Venizelist movement, Sir F. Elliot learns that the cause has not prospered, recently ; for this several reasons are cited. First is the absence of any substantial military success by the Allied and Nationalist forces in Macedonia ; there is now no enthusiasm for the cause anywhere except in the islands. There has also beeu a certain amount of friction between Veuizelos and the French; Ins relations with General Sarrail have not been cordial. Finally, the Provisional Governments administration is unpopular in certain districts. M. Veuizelos himself is conscious that his army and his cause have been greatly handicapped by the restrictions imposed on him by the Powers ; his desire to occupy Thessaly is political, and its primary object is to arouse new enthusiasm for the Nationalist movement. Several of Ins chief supporters, however, recognise the dangers to which his cause and his adherents in Royalist Greece must be exposed in the event of an armed occupation of Thessaly. It must entail civil war in Greece, and the risk of a successful Bulgar offensive. M. Politis and General Negropontis are in favour of a waiting game and of strengthening the Greek forces in the Army of the East.M. Zaimis has suggested to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Athens that from the Allies&apos; point of view there is some danger in the VenizeJist movement, inasmuch as it may serve the German and Bulgarian Governments as a pretext for revoking the assurances which they have given to restore all occupied territory to the Greek Government. In that event, he thinks it possible that the Allies, even.though victorious, might, in their haste to conclude peace, agree to leave Greek territory in the hands of the enemy. Commenting on this manifestation of Royalist diplomacy&apos;, Lord Granville indignantly asks (25th May) whether M. Zaimis desires that the Allies should, evacuate Macedonia and. M. Venizelos make his peace with the hereditary enemy of Greece, in order to curry favour with. Bulgaria and Germany for the benefit of King Constantine and his advisers?- On 23rd May Lord Granville had expressed his belief in the possibility of bringing about a meeting between M Venizelos and M. Zaimis, if secrecy were observed. Sir F. Elliott was still optimistic as to the chances of eventually effecting a recon--ciliation between. Old and New Greece. On the 25th, however, the occupation of Santa Maura by a force of 100 French and .100 Venizelist troops, helped by three torpedo boats, altered the aspect of affairs and convinced Sir F. Elliot that the French. Government are actually not in sympathy with the Allies&apos; avowed policy of conciliation, directed towards re-establishing the unity of Greece ; on the contrary, in his opinion, their intention is to force the pace at all costs. The occupation of Santa Maura was likely to create serious trouble, as a public meeting of its inhabitants (on tlie 24th) had telegraphed to the King and Government at Athens announcing their intention to defend themselves against the revolutionaries. On the 26th M. Venizelos told Lord Granville that he knew nothing of the affair. . On. the 29th, the Provisional Government admitted the fact of the occupation.; their representative, they said, had acted against their express orders, but in view of the terribly distressed condition of Venizelists in the island, they felt that they could not blame him very severely.M. Zaimis attaches no credence whatsoever to the report that the 4th Greek Corps1 has been incorporated, in the Bulgarian Army. Lord Granville, however, assisted by a British officer, has examined at Salonika one of the&quot;leuTalleged deserters from this Corps and sees no reason to doubt his story, which was supported -by much circumstantial detail. In this connection, and in order to enable him to obtain J? / a. information in such matters, he,, has enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would now allow him. to communicate in cipher with Berlin and also with Constantinople. Sir F. Elliot was instructed to say, if approached again on the subject, that His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to grant the desired privilege, as they can. have no assurance that it would be loyally observed by M. Zaimis&apos;s colleagues and subordinates.1 The skeleton corps which surrendered to the Germans at Kavala last September and has since been interned in Germany.
On 25th May Lord Grahville reported that owing to the lack of flour, New Greece-is now in a critical situation. The islands, with the exception of Crete, are confronted with starvation. As to the Thessalian harvest, he thought it unlikely that New Greece would get any of it unless the Allied Military controls are established in time. In this connection, the Foreign Office has directed Lord Granville to inform the Provisional Government that in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government it is&apos; advisable that they should requisition and control the harvest in the territories under their jurisdiction.&apos;An official communication has been addressed by the Provisional Government to the British and French representatives at Salonika, complaining of the ill-treatment of &quot;Venizelists by the Italians, in the district occupied by them near Janina.SERBIA.According to information forwarded by His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Athens, and confirmed in other quarters, Prince George of Serbia is greatly concerned at the present situation in Greece and. particularly at the political schemes of General Sarrail. If the French are allowed to realise their plans for a Greek Republic, what is to become, he asks, of the Karageorgevitch dynasty ? Serbian policy, in his opinion, like that of Italy, must be opposed to a strong Greece under Veuizelos. Pie is sending a memorandum on the subject to His Majesty&apos;s Government by the hand of Admiral Troubridge.The Serbian Government have addressed a communication to the Allied Govern-ments with regard to the new policy in the Balkans. They are dismayed at the change of plans and chagrined that these momentous decisions should have been taken without Serbia., being consulted or even informed. At Rome, the Serbian representative, while making his communication on the subject to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that the Serbian Army had. been asked to send a division to Thessaly. The\r were unable to comply with the request and apprehended the gravest dangers from the weakening of the Allied forces on Salonika front, as the Bulgarians have been strongly reinforced. Sir R. Rodd, transmitting this information, adds that if the Serbians are left in the lurch, they are likely, in the opinion of competent observers,, to accept the overtures made to them by Austria for the creation of an autonomous-Jugo-Slav State with political relations similar to those of Hungary. Their army is now reduced to half its original numbers. They are convinced that the French military forces have been largely held in reserve to cany out political schemes in Greece and they are therefore anxiously perturbed.Lord Granvjlle reports that the Serbian Government propose, with the consent of the Provisional Government, to establish, themselves at Agostos, half Ayay between Veria and Vodena.The British. Government have signified their willingness to allow the Cretan Division to serve under the British Commander at Salonika, provided that the French Government have no objections. Lord Bertie was directed to ascertain their views (24th May).BULGARIAThe Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed the United States Minister at Sofia that Bulgaria does not propose to break off relations with the United States.GERMAN  AFFAIRS.Sir W. Townley.learns on reliable authority that the recent negotiations between the Chancellor and Count Czernin and Herr Hertling, concerning the Polish Regency and the partition, of Alsace Lorraine respectively, ended in arrangements to the following effect : (1) The solidarity of policy between Vienna and Berlin was re-affirmed, Vienna undertaking to make no independent statements and to work with Germany for a separate peace with Russia. (2) If such a peace prove unattainable, the Archduke Charles Stephen would become Regent of Boland provisionally and without prejudice to that country&apos;s future status ; (3) Prussia agrees to the absorption by Bavaria of Alsace and part of Lorraine, but the permanence of this arrangement is conditional on Prussia being able to secure compensation for herself in the peace settlement. Other stipulations referred to the Ludwig Canal Rhine-Danube scheme and the conclusion of an economic Treaty between Germany and Austria-Hungary.The German Press gives evidence of increasing anxiety in official and financial circles on the subject of trade after the war.   Several leading articles on and since
the 23rd May indicate a growing perception of the cumulative damage which is being inflicted on German trade connections overseas by the Allies&apos; statutory list policy, -and of the fact, that the longer the war lasts the more difficult will it be for Germany to recover the ground thus lost. German publicists are beginning to realise that economic recuperation will be impossible if Germany is hereafter debarred from obtaining raw materials except at prohibitive prices.Considerable uneasiness is also displayed on.the subject of Russia&apos;s peace terms, as modified by the latest utterances of M. Kerensky and M. Terestchenko. Count Reventlow, in the &quot; Deutsche Tageszeitung,&quot; recognises in these utterances a triumph, for British, and French diplomacy, and deprecates the subservient attitude of German Socialism towards Russia. He asserts that in its main objects, the present policj&apos; of the Russian Government is at one with that of England and France (namely, to ruin and partition Germany) and that Germany&apos;s wisest course is, therefore, to assume the worst and be prepared to meet it. The &quot; Vorwarts &quot; (23rd May) thinks the Chancellor is to blame for not having declared boldly for &quot; no annexations.&quot;The word &quot; revolution &quot; is becoming a constant feature in the German political vocabulary. It occurs not only in utterances by Scheidemann, Ledebour, Dettmann, and other Socialists, who discuss the possibility of a German Republic, but in the heated correspondence which recently passed between the Chancellor and the Pan-German League. Freiherr von Gebsattel, President of the League, asserted that revolution will be the result of an &quot;incomplete peace,&quot; a peace which should give the German soldier increased taxation instead of the compensations to which he looks forward. &quot; The people thus deceived would rise . . . The future of our people is at stake, the monarchical principle of the Empire endangered.&quot; This idea, sprung from widely different sources, has evidently come to stay. &quot; The German people,&quot; says Bernstein, &quot; possesses a mind and demands the right to proclaim it aloud.&quot; Herr Dettmann declares &quot; Not Russia to-day, but Prussia is the most reactionary force in the world.&quot; Nevertheless, the keynote of the Press remains largely anti-Chancellor, and for the greater part inspired by annexationist aims. The &quot;Tageszeitung&quot; doubts whether he still commands a working majority in the Reichstag.According to information supplied to Washington by certain American journalists wdio accompanied Count Bernstorff to Berlin, a new spirit of: democracy, born of the war and of events in Russia, is springing up in Germany. Bernstorff, Ballin and Harden, they say, are the leaders of the democratic group ; its supporters in the Army are numerous among the younger officers, and Ludendorff is supposed to be in sympathy with the movement. There is talk of the Chancellor being succeeded by either Bernstorff or Von Arnim. The Chancellor and Zimmermann are blamed for having brought the United States into.the war through the Mexican Note blunder.A report from Berne (29th May) states that Captain Persius has written an article in the &quot; Vossische Zeitung &quot; showing that the submarine campaign can never win the war.   The whole edition of the paper containing this article was confiscated.AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.Considerable significance has been attached to the fact that at the Austrian. emperor&apos;s reception at Laxenburg Castle on 21st May the Polish Club leaders in the Reichsrath were not included amongst the invited guests. The proposal to confer Polish throne upon an Austrian Archduke has evidently not produced unanimity in German-Austrian political circles. As an alternative to that form of security for the future administration of &quot; the Polish territory which we have conquered,&quot; the &quot; Miinchener Neueste Nachrichten &quot; considers that if the new State were allowed to select its own form of government (not necessarily monarchical) it would be more likely to agree to such a rectification of frontiers as is necessary to Germany&apos;s military security. An agreement on these lines would offer more durable guarantees than a King whose throne would have to be supported by German and Austrian bayonets if Russia&apos;s republican ideas should spread into Poland. The Munich organ concludes that the king-making policy requires very careful considera-tion : &quot;the monarchical principle in Germany is organic and deep-rooted, but that is no reason for making it an article of export.&quot;A Budapest telegram of the 26th published in the &quot; Vossische Zeitung &quot; announces that the Archduke Joseph has failed in the attempt to unravel the tangle in which Count Tisza has left the political affairs of Hungary. It is expected that Count Anclrassy will now be called upon to form a Ministry.2982-5G
SWEDEN.Tlie Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed to Sir E. Howard his Governments great and increasing anxiety on the subject of the new economic and industrial situation imposed upon Sweden by the co-operation of the United States in the blockade policy of the Allies. The Swedish Government, he said, are sincerely anxious to settle all questions outstanding with Great Britain. He pointed to the recently improved conditions of transit traffic and the offer to resume parcel post transport, as evidence of Sweden&apos;s goodwill, which he thought His Majesty&apos;s Government should now recognise by allowing her to receive from America certain urgently needed cargoes of phosphates, cotton, oil, rubber, jute, &amp;c. Industrial conditions throughout the country were becoming critical owing to the &quot;lack of raw materials. Under these circumstances, and pending the conclusion of satisfactory blockade arrangements with the United States, Sir E. Howard considers that it would lie politically wise to allow limited quantities of urgently needed supplies to come forward. At the same time he thinks it advisable that the Allies (including the United States) should before long inform the Scandinavian Governments as to the main lines of their future blockade policy.The chief Liberal organ, &quot; Dagens Nyheter,&quot; admits that Sweden is now at Great Britain&apos;8 mercy, but takes comfort from the fact that Swedish neutrality is now absolutely unquestioned, and that England is always mindful of the needs of small States. Mr. lb-anting in the Socialist organ takes the same line and emphasises the change of public opinion in Sweden manifested in the change of Government ; the blockade policy, properly directed against the Government of the late Prime Minister would, if exercised now, drive public opinion over to the German side &quot;where brutality is the highest law.&quot; Quoting these utterances, Sir E. Howard, reiterated his opinion that an accommodating spirit should, lie shown by the British Government,, and the wants of SwedeiPs working classes supplied. On the 26th he reported that industrial unrest was visibly growing and prices rising. The Foreign Office, replying on the 2Sth, drew attention to the fact that Sweden, has been, and still is, a base of supplies for Germany within the limits of her resources and that, in view of the prospect of effective pressure being organised in and from the United States, no good purpose would be served by adopting a benevolent attitude towards Sweden without securing valuable counter concessions. So long as large exports continue to reach Germany from Sweden, as at present, His Majesty&apos;s Government, cannot support the view that Sweden should be given facilities to import raw materials, cattle, fodder,Wc. As regards transit, His Majestys Government hope, with the aid of the United States Government, to be soon in a position to insist on full and free transit, relieved of the present complicated system, of compensation.In a recent despatch Sir E. Howard refers to the growth of the democratic, movement in. Sweden, which recent events in Russia have stimulated. Significant of the present tendency of political opinion amongst the working class, was. the-interpellation recently addressed to the Government by Mr. Bran ting on the subject of electoral reforms he asked that the election of members of the Upper House should be reformed, and that tlie direct general franchise be conferred on women and men alike. Mr. Bfanting&apos;s programme of democratic reforms is far-reaching and vigorous, lint it is opposed to methods of violence, and seeks to secure the developments desired of tlie people by constitutional procedure. Even the extreme Socialists (led by M. Lindhagen, the Mayor of Stockholm), who aim at an ideal democracy very different, from the bourgeois Republics of America and. Prance, are all for the steady pressure of organised voters and against violent revolutionary proceedings. Looked at in this light, the quiet determination of the May-day demonstrations is in itself&apos; ominous for the clique of Junkers and Prussianised professors who have held power in Sweden under the Hammarskjold regime.NORWAY.Great indignation and a political situation of increasing tension have been produced in Norway by Germany&apos;s seizure of, and refusal, to release the S.S. &quot;Thorium.&quot; This vessel was chartered to, and ,employed by, the Norwegian Government for the transport of hay to relieve the scarcity of: fodder in Northern Norway. Germany&apos;s deferential expressions of regret at Stockholm for the sinking of Swedish ships have increased the anger of the Norwegians, and the announcement that German vessels are prepared to take a share of the Norwegian coasting trade lias-added fuel to the fire.   &quot; Seldom,&quot; says Sir M. Findlay, &quot; has Scandinavian opinion
been so strongly and simultaneously aroused.&quot; The Norwegian Press have unaui-mously demanded the restitution of the &quot;Thorium,&quot; and the Government cannot ignore the strength of public feeling on the subject. A. Cabinet Council has discussed the possibility of a common Scandinavian policy to cut off all exports to Germany ; but it is recognised that Norway7 could&apos;take no such action except in concert with Sweden and Denmark-.On 29th May His Majesty&apos;s Minister was informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Germany, in answer to the Norwegian Governments demand for the immediate release of the ship, had first replied that she had been handed over to the &apos; Prize Court. A second Note, however, had offered to release the vessel on certain conditions, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarded as inacceptable, but which he declined to communicate to Sir M. Findlay.SPAIN.The reverberations of the Russian revolution, and particularly the effect of its republican doctrines, have had the effect of impairing British influence in Spain. Sir A. Hardinge considers that the new Spanish Government is not actually hostile (though the Minister of Finance is anything but well, disposed), but the Germans have been at pains to inculcate the opinion that Great Britain is by no means firm in allegiance to the monarchical principle, and that an Anglo-Russian victory might involve Europe in the triumph of socialism and nihilism ; whereat court and conservative circles are greatly concerned. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador implies that a public declaration, of monarchical faith might be timely and useful.The Spanish Government have withdrawn the 33 per cent, condition in regard to the loading of iron-ore cargoes, and seem disposed to come to an understanding on the subject of the Cortina agreement. They are still taking steps, however, which point to a desire to control coal supplies at their ports. Considering all existing circumstances, His Majesty&quot;s Government are of opinion, and have instructed Sir A. Hardinge, that drastic pressure need not be applied for the time being, but that he should arrange with his American, colleague to intimate discreetly that Spain need expect no further coal from tlie United States as, under the Cortina agreement, her requirements will be supplied by Great Britain.German submarines are still, operating in Spain&apos;s territorial waters. The Greek ship &quot; Aristides &quot; was sunk within two miles of the shore on 26th May.PORTUGAL).The British Government have offered to lend 2,000,000Z. to Portugal forthwith, on the security of the ex-German ships already  handed over by the Portuguese authorities, and under certain conditions concerning the repayment (5 per cent, per annum interest and 10 per cent, sinking fund.) and expenditure of the loan. One of these conditions restricts expenditure to purchases made by the Commission -Internationale de Ravitaillement after approval by His Majesty&apos;s Treasury.Meanwhile PortugaPs needs, as demonstrated by the recent food riots, are reaching the critical stage. On 23rd May the Minister for Foreign Affairs requested Sir L. Carnegie to obtain the British Governments sanction to the retention in Lisbon of a cargo of wheat arriving on the S.S. &quot; Cunene.&quot; It was hinted, that the Portuguese authorities, under pressure of public necessity, might be compelled to requisition the grain if this permission were refused. The Premier is freely blamed, by Parliament and Press for the present economic crisis, which is attributed to his having disposed of the German ships to Great Britain.CHINA.The Japanese Government adhere to their opinion that the moment is.inopportune for making the offer proposed by the British and other Allied Governments to China (vide last Report). On 24th May the Minister for Foreign Affairs handed a Memorandum to Sir C. Greene explaining the reasons upon which, this opinion is based and expressing the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not insist upon making the proposed, offer which, differs in certain respects from that which was originally agreed to by the Powers concerned. The Minister took occasion to express the further hope that. His Majesty&apos;s Government would adhere to the precedent hitherto observed of consulting Japan in the first instance in all questions concerning China, as agreed in the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Alliance. He professed to be optimistic in regard to the outcome of the present jtolitical crisis at Peking.
His Majesty&apos;s Minister in China reported on 28th May that Li Ching-hsi had been elected Premier, vice Tuan, dismissed by mandate of the President on the 24th ; his nomination was accepted by a large majority in both Houses of Parliament. On&quot; the day of his dismissal Tuan left for Tientsin, but the manifesto which he was expected to make as to his attitude was postponed, pending the decision of the Conference of Military Governors at Hsuchou. As regards the question of declaring war against Germany, Mr. Alston reports that, pending the reconstruction of the Cabinet, it remains in abeyance, but the unsatisfactory nature of the news from Russia is likely to give Parliament cause for hesitation.&quot; Putnam Weale,&quot; Peking correspondent of the &quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot; published a leader in the &quot; Peking Gazette&quot; of 24th May maintaining the right of Mr. Eugene Chen to claim British citizenship and threatening to make an international incident of his imprisonment unless the British Legation secured his release. In a letter addressed to Mr. Alston he further threatened to test Air. Chords rights in an action at law in London. Mr. Alston explains that &quot; Putnam Weale&apos;s &quot; real object is political and intended to embarrass the supporters of Premier Tuan by securing British intervention on behalf of a journalist whose anti-Japanese bias is notorious. Mr. Alston refers incidentally to the relations known to exist between Mr. Eugene Chen and the Peking Manager of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank. The Foreign Office, in reply, while approving Mr. AlstoiPs action, desires that nothing shall be done to hinder Mr. Chen from making good, if he can, his claim to British citizenship ; for which purpose his lawyer should be assisted in obtaining access to him. He has been sentenced to four months&apos; imprisonment, a fact which would seem to imply that his arrest was not solely due to his attacks upon the Premier, since dismissed.. JAPAN.His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tokio was instructed (24th May) to approach the Japanese Government with a request, based in the first instance on general grounds of necessity and expediency, that they should modify their present attitude in regard, to their merchant shipping and allow Japanese tonnage to be available for Allied services in connection with the war. In submitting this request, Sir 0. Greene was directed to remind the Japanese Government of the secret arrangement concluded in 1907, whereby Great Britain undertook to lend Japan 1.40,000 tons of shipping for transport work in the event of war ; also to point out that Japaids shipping interests have derived no small benefit from the war and have expanded in many directions, whereas her Allies&apos; activities have been greatly curtailed by the exigencies of the tonnage problem. For these and other reasons His Majcsty&apos;s Government feel justified in asking the Japanese Government to bear their part in the Allies&apos; common burden of sacrifice and that they should release afair share of their shipping resources for the essential services of the war. Sir C. Greene was instructed to do everything possible to convince the Japanese Government that in their own. interests a change of policy in this matter is advisable; His Majesty&apos;s Government, in conjunction with the United States, are in a position to apply pressure-by withholding supplies of steel and other materials.Replying on the 2Sth, Sir C. Greene observed that the force of the appeal which (as instructed) he was making must be to some extent weakened by the Prime MinisteFs recent statement on the waning of the submarine peril and by Lord Robert CeciPs public eulogy of the valuable services rendered by Japan to the Allied cause. In the event of the appeal being successful, however, he thought the Japanese Government might well begin by suppressing the present futile competition between Japanese liners running to Australia, and by taking tonnage off a number of experimental routes. Finally, he advised that, if anything practical is&apos;to be done, it will be necessary to reinforce the Legation staff by sending out someone thoroughly acquainted with Allied shipping conditions and requirements.In this connection it is of interest to note that the last two ships completed to the order of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Japanese yards sailed in ballast. Sir C. Greene recommends that in future the Controller of Shipping should use such vessels for transport of the large quantities of British-owned goods awaiting export at Kobe.The British and French representatives at Tokio have been instructed to inform the Japanese Government&quot; that the Governments of Great Britain and France take official note of Japan&apos;s reservation in connection with ratification of the resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference, and reserve to theinsefves a similar liberty of action vis-a-vis the Japanese Government.
ARGENTINA.In view of the circumstances set forth in last weelts Report, His Majesfy&apos;s &quot;Government have decided to import no more wheat from the Argentine and to use such tonnage as is available for the transport of maize.BRAZIL.On 23rd May, by 136 votes to 3, the Chamber of Deputies revoked the Decree of 23rd April respecting the observance of neutrality as far as the United States, are concerned in the war against the Central Powers. Sir A. Peel thinks that this decision will be extended to govern BraziPs relations with all the Allies.His Majesty&apos;s Government have instructed Sir A. Peel to inform the Brazilian Government of the nature and extent of German activities off the mouth of the Amazon and to request that the Brazilian Navy may co-operate in supporting them.URUGUAY.The Government organ in Montevideo has published, an article advocating that Uruguay should follow the example of Brazil in taking action against Germany&apos;s submarine campaign by allowing privileges to the United States Navy in Uruguayan waters. The Government, it seems, very sensitive in their amour-propre, are hurt at not having been approached by Brazil with: a view to united action by all the South American Republics. Meanwhile they decline to take any action in regard to the requisitioning.of enemy ships, or to follow the example of Brazil in placing armed Guards aboard them.MEXICO.After discussing at Washington the policy of the United States Government towards Mexico, Mr. Thurstan is of opinion that the attempt to conciliate and pacify Carranza is a lamentable mistake. He thinks that if; Carranza were to come out on the side of the Allies Germany would be the gainer; she would have the sympathy of the great majority who hate Carranza and have no love for the United States. The United States would be lulled to a false and dangerous sense of security, but Carranza is not to be trusted. Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to suggest to the State Department that any loan made to Carranza should be by limited instalments only. Mr. Thurstan, now at Washington, has been granted home leave, and Mr. Cummins remains in charge of the Legation in Mexico. On 26th May he reported that the Mexican &quot;Government had taken half a million dollars from the Tramway Company, ostensibly for the payment of troops.CUBA.Mr. Leech reports that the Governments position is greatly improved and tire insurrection waning.NICARAGUA.The Republic severed diplomatic relations with Germany on 19th May.COSTA RICA.In Reports Nos. 12 and 13 reference was made to the refusal of the United States Government to recognise Sehor Ti.noco&apos;s Administration in Costa Rica, although advised of His Majesty&apos;s Governments concurrence in the Opinion of Sir 0. Mallet (Panama) that it would be to the advantage of the Allies to do so. On 23rd May His Majesty&apos;s Consul at San Jose reported that certain supporters of the deposed President have spread reports that the United States Government will recognise him in the event of his recovering even a small portion of territory. In this connection Sir C. Mallet observes that it -would be deplorable if the present friendly disposed Government of Costa Rica were compromised and endangered by the United States&apos; refusal to recognise it. The Administration desires to sever relations with Germany, but having at present no recognised status is unable to do so. The Foreign Office has instructed His Majesty&apos;s representative at Washington to ascertain exactly what are the opinions and intentions of the State Department in this matter, and. to point -out that the policy of ignoring Sehor Tiuoco&apos;s Government is calculated, to discourage29G2-5 u
other American Republics from declaring for the Allies. Mr. Barclay considers that President Wilson&apos;s nnwilliuguess to recognise Sehor Tinoeo arises from his-consistent dislike of revolutionary movements in Central America ; but the matter is still under his consideration.UNITED STATES.Mr. .Balfour&apos;s Mission, accompanied by Sir C, Spring Rice, left Washington for Canada on 24th May.Having reference to the policy of bringing concerted pressure to bear on neutrals in order to restrict their exports to the enemy and to stimulate their activities on behalf of the Allies, the Foreign Office has now supplied His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington with detailed information and suggestions as to the means and methods by which the desired pressure can be most effectively exercised on Scandinavia and Holland. A first general requisite is to arrange for the systematic licensing of American exports, under a uniform system, of letters of assurance and navicerts for; all cargoes. His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that this can best be attained by the United. States&apos; appointment of special delegates to London, who would there-familiarise themselves with the Allies&apos; -working control system and. advise Washington in regard to all blockade matters, including the restriction of essential exports to-neutral countries.As specific matters, in which united action should be brought to hear, His-Majesty&apos;s Embassy will lay stress on the necessity for inducing Denmark to make a. drastic reduction, if not a total, cessation, of her large exports of cattle, meat, and fish to Germany. Pier export of horses should be completely stopped. As regards Sweden, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the Swedish Government should be plainly told that no facilities will be given them to import essential commodities from America unless their exports to Germany are either stopped or. greatly reduced (details of these exports are tabulated). In particular, His Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to see the export of sulphur from America to Sweden completely stopped, and that Sweden should undertake to reduce at least to pre-war figures her exports of sulphuric acid, sulphate, &amp;c, to the enemy. The regulation of the transit trade to Russia, and the release, of Swedish shipping for Allied purposes, are also matters which must be arranged, by force of economic pressure and under conditions explained. The export of foodstuffs from the United States to Scandinavia and Holland should be definitely limited by a rationing scheme, and should be conditional on the cessation or strict limitation of food exports from these countries to Germany. Holland must be led to put a stop to the extensive smuggling of goods across her frontiers into Germany. Shipments of food from the United States should - be made only in vessels belonging to the country of destination.With a view to securing effective co-ordination in the work of the several British Departments employed in the United States, as well as for the direction of pro-pagandist and educative activities, the War Cabinet propose to select and appoint an influential man of wide business knowledge, energy and capacity, to serve as head of the British Missions in the United States. While unconnected with the conduct of diplomatic affairs, he will be charged with the duty of promoting, as rapidly and effectively as possible, the organisation of American resources for the purposes of the war. This decision was communicated to Mr. Balfour and Sir C. Spring Rice (at Ottawa) on 20th May. In reply, Mr. Balfour concurred in the advisability of securing the highest possible efficiency of co-ordination and expressed the opinion that, if unexpected difficulties should arise, it might be necessary to send a specially qualified person to put things right ; but he deprecated the idea of external pressure, as calculated rather to retard the desired mobilisation of American resources. In any case, he suggested that, in the &quot;first instance, President Wilson should be consulted.The United States Government have agreed in principle to the scheme for recruiting a Polish army of about 100,000 men in the United States, to fight on the French front under the American flag, but to be definitely recognised as Polish. It is confidently expected that the organisation of this force will have an appreciable and beneficial effect upon the international situation in central Europe.Mr. Balfour telegraphed through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington on 24th May that President Wilson was taking advantage of the departure of the United States Mission for Russia, to issue a manifesto explaining, more clearly than he has done in earlier pronouncements, the meaning which he attaches to the formula of: &quot;no annexations and no indemnities,&quot; i.e., he desires to see Alsace-Lorraine restored to France, and Poland re-established, and he would exact compensation for Belgium and Northern France.
SHIPPING SITUATION.The Foreign Office is unable to accept Sir E. Howard&apos;s suggestion that the encouragement offered to Swedish shipowners has not been sufficient to induce them to resume trade with the United Kingdom. As a matter of fact, between 2Sth February and 20th May, 22 Swedish ships have been released from. British ports and only 20 have arrived. The Swedish Government have refused permission for their shipping to trade to France, despite the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government offered to insure them. By immobilising her tonnage, as she has done, Sweden has played into the hands of Germany. For these reasons His Majesty&apos;s Government are unwilling to allow Swedish vessels the privilege of calling at Halifax until assured of a sincere intention on the part of the Swedish Government and shipowners to resume trading with Great Britain. Sir E. Howard has been instructed to inform the Swedish Government of this decision, and. to state that for the present and as an exceptional measure the privilege will be allowed experimentally and only in proportion to the extent to which normal shipping traffic with the United Kingdom is resumed.In spite of the many and long conferences which His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Christiania has held with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the representatives of the Food Commission and Shipowners&apos; Association, there would appear to be no satisfactory prospect of the British Governments proposals being accepted in regard to the acquisition or requisition of Norwegian tonnage. The negotiations have, in fact, tended to become diffuse and confused on points of. detail, and to reflect the Norwegian Governments reluctance to take any definite initiative, for which Germany might call them to account, in. facilitating a friendly and mutually advantageous agreement with Great Britain. On 23rd May the Shipowners&apos; Association handed to Sir M. Findlay a reply to his latest proposals. They raised seven points of detail in regard to which, generally speaking, His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed to accept their conditions. After conveying an intimation to this effect on the 26th, however, Sir M. Findlay was disappointed to find that very little active assistance was to be expected from the shipowners of their own initiative,. They advised that bunker or other pressure should, be applied ; in other words, that requisitioning or time-chartering by friendly agreement was not likely to meet with their support, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government should incur the odium of compulsory requisitions. Under these circumstances, Sir M. Findlay was informed by the Foreign Office that if the shipowners &quot;are definitely unwilling to come to a friendly arrangement, the only alternative open to His Majesty&apos;s Government must lie in more drastic methods.General Goethals now estimates that the maximum output of new steel ships from American yards in .1.8 months is 3,000,000 tons dead weight; fulfilment of this estimate will depend upon steel production and transportation facilities.Reports furnished by Swedish seamen lately returned to Stockholm from Libau show that six Swedish vessels wre.re sunk with, dynamite by one submarine on the 18th and 19th May not far from Raumo.   Other sinkings were reported.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.Amidst the tumult of conflicting ideals, influences and opinions converging upon the Stockholm Conference, it is difficult to form any very clear idea as to the conditions under which it will meet, or the prospects of its initiating any clear line of socialistic thought or united policy. But the decision unanimously recorded by the various sections represented at the National Council of French Socialists on 28th May would appear to justify the conclusion that the Stockholm Conference will be attended by delegates from most European countries, and that it will be generally regarded as preliminary to a regularly constituted International Labour Conference, with German participation, as proposed by the Russian group. On the question of meeting the German Socialists of the majority party there are, however, many differences of opinion. The future attitude of several delegations, including the French, appears to depend upon whether the German Government will grant passports to delegates of the minority groups, a matter in regard to which (according to a statement by Herr Baase in the &quot;Social Demokraten.&quot; of the 25th) some uncertainty still exists. Mr. Branting, under whose leadership the Conference will be held/will not agree to the reception of the German majority Socialists unless the minority are allowed to attend, and proposes that the latter should speak first. The attitude of the United States towards the Conference, based on the views originally expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, has been oueof strong disapproval. Passports were refused by the State Department to intending Delegates and a warning was issued (24th May) that any United States
citizen attending would be liable to severe penalties. On 27th May, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government decided, in compliance with the strong feelings expressed on the subject in Russia, to issue passports for Russia to Labour and Socialist members&apos; of Parliament and others representing the Labour Party, the Independent Labour Party and the British Socialist Party. These delegates will proceed to Russia in response to an invitation telegraphed by the Executive Committee of the Workmen^ Council; &quot;but it will be open to them to break their journey at Stockholm and attend the Conference if they so desire. Upon hearing of His Majesty&apos;s. Governments change of attitude (27th May) Mr. Lansing expressed considerable surprise and enquired whether the question had been discussed with the United States Ambassador in London.The WorkmerPs Council in Petrograd, according to an. official Report compiled for the Belgian Government by Mr. Vandervelde, are in favour of imposing preliminary conditions on all &quot;delegates attending the proposed plenary &quot;International&quot; Conference ; but they would endeavour to make these conditions acceptable to the German, majority group. Mr. Vandervelde himself, like Mr. Brant big, considers that a meeting of Allied Socialists with those Germans who admit their solidarity with the Emperor and all he stands for, would be dangerous and futile. The Swiss official Socialists decline to attend on the ground that they object to the class struggle being abandoned by official Socialists &quot;elsewhere.&quot; The Austrian delegates reached Stockholm on the 25th.M. Thomas has sent a message to M. Ribot from Moscow strongly urging that the Allies should be represented at the Stockholm &quot;conversations&quot; under certain conditions ; one of these is that the Russian Socialists peace formulae should be unequivocally explained in meetings preliminary to the Conference. In his opinion, the Allied cause has everything to gain by a Conference thus constituted. The Italian Minister of the Interior considers that it would be a serious mistake to try to prevent Italian Socialists of either party from attending.Mr. Henderson left Stockholm for Petrograd on 28th May. He was unable to see Mr. Branting, who was out of town. He is of opinion that Mr. Roberts, M.P., should, arrange to meet Mr. Branting and the Conference Committee before proceeding to Russia.The Stockholm papers report the arrival from Berlin of certain Indian Nationalists led by V. Chattopadahaya, who have come, not to discuss peace, but independent self-government for India.GENERAL.By an order of the Austrian Minister of War, postal packets for British prisoners in Turkey may again be sent through Austria-Hungary.Renewed complaints have been made in regard to the non-delivery of parcels to British prisoners in Germany (eg., at Claustal Camp). The Netherlands Minister at Berlin has been requested to expedite his enquiries as much as possible.Owing to an oversight of the Butch authorities in the transmission of a Note of 10th May from the German Government, on the subject of the withdrawal of prisoners of Avar to the 30 kilometres distance from the firing line, the British Govern-rnent&apos;s final assurance on the subject was only forwarded for the information of the German Government on 30th May. it was accompanied by a request for an imme-diate assurance that British prisoners in German hands have been similarly withdrawn, both, on the Eastern and Western fronts.Pour hundred tons of flour have been forwarded, from Headquarters to the British section of the Bureau de Secours aux Brisonniers de Guerre at Berne, to be lent to the Serbian section.   Sir C. des Graz has been informed.The British military authorities are establishing a convalescent camp for 2,000 men at Corfu.In. view of the fact that Wolffs Bureau and other German agencies have persistently spread reports that the British and French Governments are placing obstacles in the way of Russian political refugees desiring to return from Switzerland to Russia, Sir H. Rumbold has been authorised to publish an official denial in the Swiss Press and to state that, so far from placing obstacles in the way, His Majesty&apos;s Government are willing to afford, facilities for the journey in so far as may be possible.
APPENDIXTOWestern and General Report No. 18.Views of Dominion Statesmen upon tlie subject of the imperial war Cabinet.The attitude of the leaders of political thought in the Dominions, both with regard to the policy involved, by calling together the Imperial War Cabinet, and also with reference to the decision to make this method of consultation an annual institu-tion, is important from more than one point of view. In the first place, it is indicative of the general bearing of the political parties towards questions of closer union of the Empire, and in the second place, it serves to show the definite limitations which are placed., even by leading exponents of Imperial unity, upon any measures which it is thought may affect the position of the Oversea Countries as &quot; autonomous nations of an Imperial Commonwealth.&quot;CANADA.The position of the Prime Minister of Canada in regard to the matter was, perhaps, most clearly defined in his address at the recent Parliamentary luncheon1, when he used these significant words : &quot; To the deliberations of: the Imperial War Cabinet have been summoned repre-sentatives of all the Empirc&apos;s self-governing Dominions. We meet there on terms of equality under the presidency of the First Minister of the United Kingdom; -we meet there as equals, although Great Britain presides, primus inter pares. Ministers from six nations sit around the council board, all of them responsible to their respective Parliaments and to the people of the countries which they represent. Each nation has its voice upon questions of common concern and highest importance, as the deliberations proceed ; each preserves unimpaired its perfect autonomy, its self-government, and the responsibility of its Ministers to their own electorate.&apos;&apos;With the Constitution of the Imperial War Cabinet a new era has dawned and. a new page of history has been written. It is not for me to prophesy as to the future significance of these pregnant events; but those who have given thought and energy to every effort for full constitutional development of the oversea nations may be pardoned for believing that they discern therein the birth, of a new and greater Imperial Commonwealth.&quot;Having regard to the critical attitude adopted by the great majority of the French Canadian Nationalists, and also by a large section of the Liberal Party, with reference to the possible invasion of self-governing powers by closer methods of Imperial consultation, it is not surprising that Sir Bobert Borden should have emphasised the complete responsibility of the delegates in the Imperial War Cabinet to their respective Parliaments, and Sir Robert again referred to this in the Dominion House of Commons on 18th May, when&apos;he stated that the &quot; scheme involved not the slightest effect on the Dominiohs authority&apos;.&quot; The Dominion Parliament, he said, would be consulted.Being unable to criticise the matter from that standpoint, which had certainly proved effective in regard to other schemes, the Leader of the Liberal Party (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) expressed the view that the Imperial War Cabinet &quot;would be unable to conclude anything,&quot; inasmuch as the reports to the various governments woidd be subject to acceptance or rejection by them. He added that the hopes of Imperial reorganisation expressed when the recent Conference was called were known by experienced men to be a delusion, and in view of the disparity of the populations he did not imagine any system better than the present. But he admitted that, by the action taken, one point had been gained in the recognition of the principle of focal autonomy7.1 See report of Luncheon given at the House of Commons by the Empire Parliamentary Association, on 2nd April 1917.2962-5 e . .
Sir Robert borden, however, was able to show that by the system of annual meetings, the proposed Cabinet would deal with matters of Imperial import before, not after, action by the British Government ; and lie had previously pointed out in an interview that : &quot; There is reason to anticipate that the practice thus established will develop into a recognised usage, subject, of course, to any conclusion which may be&apos; reached by the Special Conference that will meet immediately after the war to consider constitutional relations and readjustments.&quot;It is to be noted that the resolution proposed by Sir R. Bordeu at the Imperial &quot;War Conference, in favour of the appointment of the Special Conference to which he makes reference above, recorded tlie view of the Conference that any re-adjustment of constitutional relations should recognise the right of the Dominions to an adequate voice in Foreign Policy and &quot; should provide effective, arrangements for continuous consultation in all important matters of common Imperial concern.&quot; But the Canadian Prime Minister has, it should he remembered, recently declared that he does not regard the idea of an Imperial Parliament as feasible.&apos;jii his speech proposing the Constitutional Resolution at the Conference, Sir R. Borden said, &apos;&quot; I hope that the Delegation which will come to the next Conference &quot; from the Dominion which I have the honour to represent will, be representative of &quot; all political parties ;&quot; and in the Dominion House of Commons on 18th May he formally invited Sir Wilfrid Laurier to go to the next Conference with him.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The position adopted by Mi&apos;. Hughes is now specially important, as, being Leader of the new Nationalist Party (consisting of the whole Liberal Party and that section of the old Labour Party which supported the policy of conscription), he commands a majority of 25 in the Plouse of Representatives (In a House of 75 Members) and a majority of 10 in the Senate (consisting of 36 Members).The general attitude of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth towards the policy of calling the Dominions into consultation in the manner decided upon, was indicated in a speech delivered on 22nd February last, when he said : &quot; The Conference marks a new epoch in Imperial development. ... It will, for example, consider the conduct of the war, peace (and the terms upon which the Empire will agree to it), Imperial trade (including preference), and the Constitution of the Empire. For the first time in the history of the Empire the voice of the self-governing Dominions will be heard on - these great questions, upon which the destinies of Nations hang; on which the future of the Dominions depends ; on. which they have previously never been consulted peace and war.&quot;As to the subsequent development of the Imperial War Cabinet into an annual institution, Mr. Hughes made an important pronouncement on 18th May, in the course of which he said : -&quot; While it is impossible to predict the precise form which imperial relations, now in a state of flux, will ultimately take, yet a great step has been taken in affirming the principle of an Imperial Cabinet at which members representing the self-governing Dominions shall sit yearly, or ofteuer if need be, to decide matters of Imperial policy.&quot; Precisely what the limitations of the powers of such a Cabinet will be, and to what extent its decisions will be followed by British Dominions and Indian Parliaments, it is impossible to say. It appeared to him, however, that there were certain limitations imposed upon the powers of such a Cabinet by the very nature of the powers of self-government enjoyed by every part of the Empire, which seemed to render any attempt to graft upon this system of responsible Government an Imperial Cabinet having plenary jurisdiction over every part of the Empire impracticable if not impossible.&quot;ft is to be noted that the fear of any interference with the responsibility of the delegates to their respective Parliaments, which seems to underlie the latter portion of the above statement, was not apparently shared by the oversea representatives whoSue speech in Dominion House of Commons, 18th May 1017.
NEW ZEALAND.The opinions of the joint representatives of the New Zealand national government (Mr. Massey, Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party, and Sir Joseph Ward, Finance Minister and Leader of the Liberal Party), were given very clearly at the Imperial War Conference discussions. Speaking to Sir R. Borden&apos;s Resolution in favour of a special Conference to deal with the readjustment of constitutional relations after the war,2 Mr. Massey said3 :  &quot; I think that when the Dominions were asked to send representatives from their Legislatures, and. from, their Governments, to the Imperial War Cabinet, it was one of the most important events that had ever taken place in the history of the British Empire.&quot; As to the continuance of the representation of the Dominions in. the Imperial Cabinet, Mr. Massey observed4 : &quot;I would like to suggest that this Imperial Conference should express an opinion to the effect, or make a recommendation to the effect, that the present arrange-meut should continue until the Conference, which we are all of opinion should be convened for the purpose mentioned in the Motion, has met, and until the new arrangement, whatever it may be, comes into operation. As an Imperialist I feel somewhat strongly on this point. ... I express my own personal, opinion when I say that it would be a retrograde step if we allowed this Conference to come to an end without expressing our appreciation of what has been done in the way of representation of the Dominions.&quot;Mr. Massey therefore proposed as an addition to Sir R. Bordeids Resolution these words :  &quot;That until such Conference&quot; that is the special&apos;Conference contemplated   &quot; has met and arrived at its conclusions, this Imperial War Conference recom-mends that the present arrangements by which representatives of the Dominions and of India occupy seats in the Imperial Cabinet shall continue.&quot;Though this addition was not included in the Resolution, on account of an anticipated announcement from Mr. Lloyd George upon the subject of continuing the oversea representation which ultimately took the form of the proposed annual meeting -Mr. Massey was emphatically in favour of the system of oversea representation in the Imperial Cabinet, and the above extracts might indeed indicate a still more continuous consultation than merely once a year.Mr. Massey has expressed himself from time to time in favour of an Imperial Parliament, subject to the preservation of local autonomy, but he declared&apos;1 that representation in the Imperial Cabinet after the war, together with a representative Imperial Council, might mean a great step forward. In any event Mr. Massey, like Sir R. Borden, stated that he hoped that the Delegation which came to the next Conference from his Dominion would be representative of all political parties.1 See statements by Sir B. BordeD, page 17 ; by Mr. Massey, page 19 ; by General Smuts, page &quot;21.2 See page 18.:! See Gd. S566 at page U.4 See Cd. 8566 at page 45.2962-5 Fwere present at the recent meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet 1 though the importance of the full maintenance of the autonomous rights of the Dominion Parliaments was clearly present to the minds of all of them.No pronouncement of the Official Labour Party of tire Commonwealth (now led by Mr. Tudor, in opposition to Mr. Hughes) has been made since the conclusion of the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet. It is worth noting, however, that they were very apprehensive in March last of any interference with local autonomy by &quot;the Imperial War Cabinet during the sittings that were about to be held. It was then anticipated that Australia would be represented at the Cabinet meetings, and the Federal Labour Party issued a manifesto in the course of which they urged that &quot; decisions affecting the Commonwealth should be submitted to the Federal Parlia-&quot; ment for ratification, and that the Commonwealth delegates be instructed to object. &quot;&quot; to any curtailment of Australians self-governing powers.&quot;
Sir Joseph Ward, in supporting the views of Mr. Massey and Sir R. Borden as to the importance of the Imperial Wax Cabinet, said1 : &quot; The change brought about by the goodwill of the Prime Minister of this country and his colleagues of inviting the representatives of the Oversea Dominions to the War Cabinet is a tremendous step forward.   .   ...   .   It gives us theopportunity of consultation, and that has appealed to the hearts of the people all over the British Empire.&quot;As to the proposed annual meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet, which was subsequently announced, it is clear from Sir Joseph Ward&apos;s-remarks at the Imperial War Conference that he hoped to see an even more continuous representation, of the Dominions in the Cabinet.   He stated : &quot; In my opinion, in some suitable way, there ought to be representation of the oversea countries in the British Cabinet of this country. How that representa-tion is to be created it is not for me to say, but I want to express the opinion that, if it is to be what is called itinerary representation by any man of responsibility from, any of the oversea countries, such, a man could not be expected to come to this country for three, six, or twelve months and then to go back again and. to come over here again for three, or six, or twelve months.In my opinion you will not get any man of any strong standing from any of the respective countries to do that. The work would require the very best man you can get.&quot;Though Sir Joseph indicated his belief that continuous representation of the Dominions in the Imperial Cabinet was a present necessity, he did not disguise his view that this step would not meet the demands of the future. He expressed himself as a strong advocate of an Imperial Parliament to deal with matters of foreign policy and Naval defence,2 for he said : &quot; I cannot for the life of me see (and I have considered, it from every standpoint) how you are going to give any authority to a representative upon a Council, or to a member of a War Cabinet, to bind the millions of people in the oversea countries . . . until 3-011 have some properly constituted Imperial Parlia-ment with well defined powers of dealing with those Empire matters to which I have just referred.&quot;SOUTH AFRICA.The attitude of the leading representatives of the Union Government towards the policy of calling the Imperial War Cabinet is, perhaps, not so clearly defined as in the other Dominions, and this is no doubt due in some measure to the constant criticism of the Nationalist Party,3 and particularly of General Hertzog, their leader, regarding any schemes of closer imperial union.The general position adopted by General Hertzog is that of strong hostility to anything approaching an Imperial Parliament, as being likely seriously to impair the autonomous character of the Union Parliament. The Nationalists have endeavoured from time to time to show that General Botha is in favour of an Imperial Parliament, but the idea was in fact opposed by him at the Imperial Conference of 1911 and many times since.as to the recent meetings, General Hertzog criticised the decision to send General Smuts to England as a representative of the. Uniou Government. While admitting the ability and training of General Smuts for the purpose, General Hertzog maintained that : &quot; The person who should take part in that Conference was the Prime Minister and not one of his colleagues, because it was the Prime Minister-who should1 See Cel. S566 at page 56. &quot; See Cel. 8566 at page 54.:; The &quot;Nationalist Party before the election of October 1915 consisted, in the House of Assembly, of about 12 members. As a result of the election, the strength rose to 27, the supporters, of General Botha numbering 54, the Unionists 40, Labour 4, and Independents 5.See Cel. 5745 at page 69, and speeches at Ennelo (bye-election), November 1916, and at Victoria West (bye-election), January 1917.
be held responsible for any step which might there be taken.   General Smuts undoubtedly was one of the greatest Imperialists.   ,.   .   .   That gave the greatest cause for anxiety, for if. he (General Smuts) should give his adhesion to any Imperialistic dream to which this country did not consent, he might be ejected from the Government, but the real offender, General Botha, would continue to carry on, instead of resigning as he should.&quot;1 Criticism of the above character may have-caused the apprehension of the Union Government when they realised that constitutional relations were to be&apos; discussed at the Imperial War Conference, and the view wras then expressed that a discussion of this nature would be inconvenient in the absence of   the Prime Minister from the Conference.General Botha, however, was careful to refer publicly2 to the circumstances of General Smuts&apos; visit to England and announced that:  &quot;If a decision was come to in the War Council, General Smuts would consult the South African Government.&quot; *He declared in this speech that he would never vote for such, an idea as an Imperial Council. &quot;It would take away the interest people had in politics in South Africa and would take away the right to govern themselves.&quot;During his visit to this country,3 General Smuts has expressed his opposition to an Imperial Parliament, because lie said it seemed, to him &quot; that the circumstances of the Empire entirely preclude the Federal solution.&quot; But he has called attention to the necessity of effective arrangements for continuous consultation in all common -concerns, especially foreign policy, and has laid emphasis on the necessity of recognising the status of the Dominions as equal nations of the Empire when considering the question of putting the future, constitutional, relations upon a better and more permanent basis.As to the system of quadrennial Conferences which had prevailed until the meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet, General. Smuts declared in a recent speech4 that :- &apos;&quot; It would be necessary to devise better machinery for common consultation than we had at present. So far, we had relied on Imperial Conferences which met once in every four years or thereabouts. However useful had been the work -which had been done at these Conferences, they had not, in his opinion, been a complete success. It would be necessary to devise better means of achieving our ends.&quot;General Smuts then referred to the precedent that had been laid down of calling together the oversea representatives to the Imperial Cabinet, and, dealing with the perpetuation of the system by means of annual meetings, he said :-&quot;It was clear that in an institution like that they had a better instrument of common consultation than they had in the old Imperial Conference, which met only every four years and which, discussed a number of subjects which were not really of first rate importance.&quot;1 Speed) at SmitliBelli, Stfi February 1917.2 See speech at Victoria West bye-election.s See Cel.
