SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN. AND  GENERALREPORT No. 8.GliEECE.The much discussed unity of policy in Greek affairs seems no nearer attainment than at any time in the past 12 months. Nor does it look as if there were any prospect of its attainment as long as the Allies attempt to find working compromises from day to day between absolutely conflicting French and British policies, instead of deciding once and for all which of them is to prevail, and giving that policy a free hand.Gki:.max Ix&quot;rr.i:.n,\i. Affaiks.The alacrity with which, the Imperial Chancellor jumps at the news of the Russian revolution in order to draw a glowing picture of the liberalisation of Germany-after the war is significant of stirrings below the surface of the well-drilled German public mind. Meanwhile, the revolution itself is generally regarded in Germany as a gamble in which the odds are all in favour of the Central Powers who stand to gain in the event of the pendulum swinging either to socialist republicanism or to a monarchical reaction, whereas the fortunes of the Allies are staked on the ability of the Provisional Government to maintain its precarious equilibrium.China.The Chinese Governmenfs apparently artless proposals for substantial financial, concessions to be made by the Allies in return for a general undertaking to assist them with raw materials and coolie labour, without any definite assurance of Chi.na&apos;s intention to declare Avar against Germany and Austria, may be intended to provide time, before making that declaration, for bargaining with the Allies on the one hand, and for conciliating the malcontent factions in the provinces on the other. The \Val-Avu-pu&apos;s traditional indifference to international usage would appear to be indicated by Mr. Alston&apos;s report that, without declaring Avar, China has assumed control OA-er the German Concessions at Tientsin and Hankow ; not to mention the fact that she has disarmed German troops in the north and seized German ships at Shanghai.United States.The effect of the Russian revolution, up to dale, is no doubt favourable to the Allied cause in America, where the Ente.nte&apos;s claim to speak for freedom against military autocracy has always met with the retort that Ru.russia&apos;s victory could not be a victory for freedom. The effect ought to be particularly good among American Poles and Jews.Meanwhile, President Wilson seems to be becoming increasingly fastidious in his selection of a really suitable &quot; OArert act &quot; for precipitating hostilities, and is apparently hoping that, if one of the newly armed American ships lires at a submarine, Germany jnay relieA^e him of the choice bv declaring Avar herself.I, S. A.22nd March 1917.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL. CONFERENCE.The Secretary of State has informed the Prime Minister of Australia that the Imperial War Cabinet at the first meeting expressed their great regret that they had not the advantage of his presence, and their sense of the serious loss occasioned by the absence of any representation from the Commonwealth.CANADA.The Canadian Government has been informed that it has been decided, to requisition all British steamers on. liner services. These will be controlled by approval Committees and utilised for essential work.The scheme will, be extended gradually to various trades, but all liners trading to South and. East Africa are to be requisitioned at once.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The Secretary of State has informed the Governor-General of the Commonwealth and the Governor of New South Wales that the Treasury will agree to a loan-issue in London of not more than 3,5Q0,000Z. in the case of the Commonwealth and 3,G00,000Z. in the case of the State of New South Wales. It is, however, made a condition that there shall be no further borrowing during 1917 ; and the question as to which loan is to take priority is left to the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South AVales to settle between, them.In reply to the telegram from the Secretary of State as to requisitioning for ocean traffic certain ships now engaged in coasting trade, the Commonwealth Govern-ment have pointed, out that the ships referred to are employed on munition work and. that the arrangements made for their utilisation in this manner were not made to protect the charterer, but to keep the mines and smelters at work. The Shipping Board is, however, endeavouring to release other and more suitable vessels for employment in carrying wheat to England.The Admiralty have requested the Australian Government to place at their disposal 500 shipyard workers, more especially platers&apos; helpers, rivetters, marine engine fitters and turners, and also unskilled labourers having knowledge of shipyards.The recruiting of skilled workers is hindered by the belief that on reaching England they will he made liable to active service. The Commonwealth Government are, however, assuring them that they will not be so liable, and the Ministers desire confirmation of this from the Secretary of State.The Commonwealth0 have been informed, that the British ships operating against the raider are receiving assistance from five Japanese cruisers. Japan has been asked to give further assistance for the protection of Australian and New Zealand troopships.By arrangement with the Commonwealth, the Australian Squadron is being employed by the Admiralty in the manner best fitted, to meet the requirements of the naval situation ; the Australian ships &quot; Encounter,&quot; &quot; Barramatta,&quot; &quot; Warego,&quot; and &apos;&apos; Yarra &quot; are, however, in Australian waters.BASUTOLAND.His Majesty the King has conveyed to the Paramount Chief of the Basuto nation his warm appreciation of the message of loyalty and the generous gift of 40,000L, and has indicated that the money will be utilised for the purchase of aeroplanes.EAST AFRICA.The Governor of the Brotectorate has informed the Secretary of State that with regard to the recruitment of Europeans it will be necessary to introduce conscription if sufficient men are to be obtained.* The 2Te\v Zealand Government have also been, notified.
PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.FRANCE.M. Ribot announced in the Chamber on the 20th instant that a decree is in preparation for approval by Parliament to forbid all but indispensable importations, with a view to reducing French payments abroad.BELGIUM.In last weeks Summary reference was made to the British Governments unwillingness to place any faith in Germany&apos;s expressed readiness to grant safe-conducts for the Relief Commission^ ships. It was believed that, behind these declarations of good intentions, the German Governments unaltered object was to tie up tonnage as much as possible. - On 15th March two Belgian relief vessels, the &quot; Tunisie &quot; and the &quot; Haelen,&quot; relying on safe-conducts issued to them by the German authorities, left; Rotterdam in ballast for the United States. On the 17th, being then outside the barred zone, they were attacked by a German submarine. The &quot;Haelen &quot; received considerable damage by shell fire, and seven of her crew were killed whilst lowering a boat to bring their papers on board the submarine.In the face of. this outrage, a German official wireless of the 20th instant reassures all neutral Governments of Germany&apos;s readiness &quot; by all possible means to assist the &quot; continuation of the Relief Commissions humane work. Its ships, plying in safe &quot; waters outside the barred zone, receive safe-conducts issued, on behalf of the German &quot; Government. In fact, the work of the Commission has never been interrupted, and &quot; never shall be, if the English place no obstacles in the way of the importation of &apos;&quot; food for this population from Transatlantic countries.&quot;GREECE.The French Government consider it inadvisable to raise the blockade until the Allied Governments are definitely assured that all their demands have been complied with by Greece. These demands, as enumerated by the French Government, are : evacuation ; prohibition of meetings and arms-bearing by reservists ; re-establishment of Controls; liberation of political prisoners ; indemnity for claims arising out of the disturbances of 1st December (to be determined by the Commission constituted under conditions named by the French Government); removal of all troops and materials of war which might endanger the security of the army of the East ; and the issue of admoni-tory decrees to the Greek Press. Finally, the French Government adhere to their opinion as to the advisability of effecting a simultaneous ;change of the Allied representatives at Athens. Lack of precise information as to the actual results of the measures adopted, in regard to some of these cp.testio.ns, and the absence of concerted action by the Allies&apos; representatives on the spot, are still marked, features of the situation. Sir F. Elliot observes, for instance, in a telegram of the 18th instant, that it is not the fault of the Greek Government if the Controls are not in operation, since the Allies&apos; definite scheme has not, yet been drawn up for the Governments acceptance. He considers that all. that is required is a statement by the special military delegates that the evacuation of Greek troops and materials has been partly, and will be completely, executed. Under these conditions, it seems probable that the blockade will continue for some time to come.Meanwhile the position resulting from shortage of grain is becoming very serious, and its effects are likely to be aggravated for the reason that the fixing of destinations for Greek wheat steamers has apparently been taken out of the hands of the Allied Board at Athens by the French naval authorities. From this step Sir F. Elliot anticipates endless confusion. Lord GranviJle, telegraphing on the 16th, described the situation at Salonika and the islands as critical, the amount of grain then available being sufficient for three clays only. The Provisional Government had requested that, as a matter of extreme urgency, one of the grain ships from America in the Mediterranean should be sent direct to Suda Bay.On the same clay Sir F. Elliot reported, that the grain ship &quot; Panclia Raili &quot; had arrived, but notwithstanding the assurances given by himself and by the French -Minister to the Greek Government as to the immediate release of her cargo, the
French Vice-Admiral, having received no instructions, had refused to allow the vessel to proceed to the Piraeus- lot discharge. She remained therefore anchored in Salarnis Strait. To the Minister^ representations, the French naval authorities replied on the 17th that, having received no answer from Paris to his request for instructions, he )) could not allow any wheat to be landed. Sir F, Elliot observes that the lack of co-operation displayed by the two French Departments concerned, has involved, him and his colleague in a gross breach of faith.Prior to this incident, Sir F. Elliot had announced his intention of re-establishing the Legation at Athens. This course had been approved by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment (though opposed by the French) on general grounds of expediency and also because the transport on which the Legation has been accommodated since December is required for general service. On the day following the refusal of the French naval authorities to permit the discharge of the wheat, however, the Minister announced his intention, of remaining on board ship until it had been landed. The &quot; Pandia Ralli&quot; was, however, permitted to proceed and discharge on the 18th, and. His. Excellency therefore resumed his arrangements for returning to Athens.On. the 16th, the Prime Minister at Athens informed Sir F. Elliot that orders would be issued at once for the release of all persons imprisoned up to 31st December on. the charge of insulting the King, and that in future such charges are not to be pressed unless supported by the strongest evidence. The value of tins assurance would appear to be somewluu lessened by the fact, reported by Lord Granville on the 20th, that two residents of Patras, brothers of a member of the Provisional Government, have been arrested on a charge of high treason for having facilitated the departure of volunteers for Salonika. The Provisional Government state that the arrest was made on a denunciation lodged by the military representative of Patras on the General Staff.In the course of an interview with Sir F. Elliot on the 18th March, M. Zaimis expressed the opinion that good, relations can never be established between Greece and. the Entente so long as General Sarrail remains at Salonika. He suggested seriously that the British Government should say to France : &quot; You have had your way for two years and have failed ; but let us try.&quot; The effect, he thought, would be magical. M. Zaimis also said that public opinion in Greece was so exasperated against M. Venizelos that if he attempted to return to Athens there would be civil war. The significance of these remarks, says Sir F. Elliot, lies in the fact that M. Zaimis was formerly friendly towards M. Venizelos, and better disposed towards France than towards England.Sir F. Elliot is of opinion that the Prime Minister, though he demurs, will eventually accept the constitution of the &quot; Reparations &quot; Commission of Enquiry. The scope of their investigations and methods of procedure are now in process of determination.Italian troops have occupied Saiada and Phil ad es.   It is reported that they intend to go as far as Parga.GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Wireless communications from Berlin to the Hearst and German-American Press-in the United States give glowing accounts of the Imperial CbancelloFs recent declaration of jDolitical faith and of his complete conversion to Liberalism. The essential features of Prussian Conservatism are to be replaced (after the war) by a regime under which the masses and the classes wall cheerfully co-operate in the reorganisation of Germany&apos;s social and political institutions. Junkerdom will accompany the &quot; new freedom &quot; on paths of progress and enlightenment. A message to the &quot; New York American &quot; (14th March) quotes the Chancellor as having said :   &quot; I hope this war may cure ris once and for all of the mischievous delusion that the &quot; interests of the working classes arc opposed to the interests of their employers and &quot; even of the State, as they have been persistently represented to be.&quot;The Irish-American correspondent of the &quot; Chicago Tribune &quot; in Berlin celebrated St. Patrichs Day by a long message describing the organisation and objects of the German-Irish Society, whose emblem is the shamrock and whose telegraphic address at Berlin is &quot; Grimeiland.&quot; The head of the new Society is Herr Erzberger, leader&apos; j) of the Centre party in the Reichstag. The first stage in its propaganda will be that of convincing Germany of the importance of Ireland; thereafter, &quot; the preparing of &quot; the ground for the establishment of economic relations between Ireland and &quot; Germany.&quot;   The introduction of German capital is to be the sine qua -non of the
movement. The economic barriers that have divided Ireland from the outside world are to be broken down, (if Germany makes &quot; a good peace&apos;&quot;) and Irish independence secured. The Society publishes a monthly review under the editorship of Dr. Chatterton Hall, who has been endeavouring, by a series of lectures in many parts of G-ermany, to put upon a permanent basis the interest aroused by Casements &quot; intensely practical propaganda.&quot;There are reports of serious disturbances, described as revolutionary, at Hamburg and at Berlin.AUSTRIAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.The following information is taken from a confidential report recently received by the Foreign Office:  The Emperor Charles is intolerant of any outside influence ; Ministerial changes are brought about by the cleverly-manipulated, insinuations of the Empress and Court circle. . . . The disgrace of the Archduke Frederick is ascribed to the Empress. When the Emperor went to Teschen. to assume command of. the army, he found a large number of German flags decorating the town; thereupon, his feelings being wounded, he moved the Austrian headquarters to Baden. A certain coolness between the two Emperors was the result.There is much hostility to Prussia, and friendliness for Bavaria, in Government circles, and some talk of political, combination against Prussia. There is. also considerable ill-feeling against Switzerland. The shortage of food is not so serious as it is in Germany.SWITZERLAND.Tire Swiss authorities have accepted in principle the arrangements proposed by the British Minister in regard to future export of cattle to the Allies and to Germany respectively, an arrangement calculated to counteract German influence by conciliating agricultural Switzerland. They stipulate, however, that the arrangement is to be regarded as lapsed unless the Italian Government release before the 15th May the stocks of linseed, and copra consigned to the Swiss Government, which they are still detaining. It is also understood that 25,000 tons of oil-cake are to be delivered to Switzerland by the Allies before the end of August, and that Great Britain will arrange for the tonnage required, over and above the 13 ships now allowed. An agreement covering these arrangements was signed at Berne on the 21st March.HOLLAND.The food situation is becoming so serious that it may be impossible next month to send abroad the 3,000 tons of bread usually allocated for the use of Russian prisoners of war (400 tons) and the Commission de Ravitaillement.The &quot; Handelsblad,&quot; advocating the arming of: Dutch grain ships and the admission of armed merchantmen, to Dutch ports, observes: &quot; Germany claims the &quot; right to sink our ships, seven at, a time, whilst professing friendly relations with &quot; this country. Why should we not claim the right, while maintaining these friendly &quot; relations, to defend ourselves against such attacks?&quot; The &apos;&apos;Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant,&quot; on the other hand, contains an. article extremely hostile to Great Britain (18th instant) with reference to the question of armed merchantmen in general and the &quot; Princess Melita &quot; in particular.&quot;On the 20th March Sir W. Townley, in the course of an interview- with the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, warned him that a very serious situation might be created in the event of the Dutch Governments continued refusal to accede to Great Britaihs legitimate and necessary request in regard to the admission of armed merchantmen to Dutch ports. The representatives of France and Russia had made similar representations. The former is of opinion that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is himself largely to blame for the Dutch Governments policy ; the Prime Minister and the military party are inclined to favour acceptance of Great Britain&apos;s view of the question. On the following day, under instructions, the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires asked whether the Netherlands Government are prepared to admit American armed merchantmen to their ports.   The reply was in the negative.2592- 3 U
SWEDEN.The Swedish Government has accepted for publication the terms of a communique to the Press drafted by Sir E. Howard. This document records the expression of regret conveyed to the British. Minister by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to the unfounded insinuations contained in recent newspaper attacks on the Legation. This communique will be forwarded to His Majesty&apos;s Minister in an official, note.   -The political situation at Stockholm remains unsettled. Last week Sir E. Howard was of opinion that a compromise might be effected by the Governments agreeing to accept the Anglo-Swedish agreement with the consent of the Conservative leaders. On the 15th instant, however, the tone of the . ultra-Conservative Press had again changed, and the Liberals were threatened with, a dissolution of Parliament unless they would abandon the Socialists and. their demand, for an effective control of the executive by Parliament. On the 17th. Sir E. Howard was informed by someone who had just seen the King that His Majesty had declared that lie would retain the Prime Minister and decline to yield to England and the Socialists. A Secret Committee of Parliament discussed the Anglo-Swedish Agreement for several hours on the 20th without arriving at any decision on the matter.Considerable effect has been produced by the publication in the Swedish Press (on the 20th) of the answer given in the House of Commons concerning the mining of the Kogrund Channel. The Prime Minister has issued a communique on the subject in which he endeavours to shift responsibility on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Sir E. Howard is of opinion that the effect of the Foreign Office statement will be to strengthen the parties of the Left and to discredit the Prime Minister in public opinion.At the recent economic conference of the Scandinavian Powers held at Stockholm, the general tone of the meeting is reported to have been decidedly friendly7 towards the Allies. It was proposed that the three Powers should adopt, and continue after the war, a policy of united, action in commercial matters.NORWAY.On the 16th March the Prime Minister complained to Sir M. Findlay&apos; in regard to the serious delays suffered by Norwegian shipping in British and. Allied ports, as the result of which Norway is threatened with a coal famine and the public inclined to panic. He cited specific instances of vexatious delays of a kind which no shipowner could reasonably be expected to accept. So far, he declared, only about 30,000 tons&quot; of coal have reached Norway. Sir M. Findlay is of opinion that good ground exists for this complaint, and that there is something wrong somewhere in the official machinery designed to secure the resumption of normal coal transport. It is recognised that the delays complained, of are not intentional ; they are generally attributed to the multiplicity of committees dealing, with the subject, whose activities result in cross purposes and endless correspondence.DENMARK.His Majesty&apos;s Minister is informed that, as the result of the failure of British coal, supplies, arrangements are being discussed for sending a number of Danish, workmen to Germany to handle coal, for Denmark in that country. The necessities of the Danish Government are such that, unless supplies from Great Britain, are forth-coming, they will be compelled to agree to any terms which Germany may see fit to impose. The Social Democrat leaders (strongly pro-German) are in a position to bring pressure to bear on the Government to obtain coal from Germany at all costs.Sir R. Baget transmits, in reply to enquiries, the following information as to the probable available exports to Germany during the next nine months iu case ail fodder imports into Denmark are now stopped. It is estimated that under these conditions it would be necessary for Denmark to dispose of 15,000 horses, 250,000 (out of 1,140,000) milk cows, 1,000,000 (out of 2,400,000) young pigs, and 5,000,000 (out of 15,000,000) poultry. As the result of the sale of milk cows, the production of butter would be reduced from 125,000 to S3,000 tons, of which 30,000 tons would be required for home consumption. In 1916 Germany received, from Denmark 38,000 tons of butter, 240,000 pigs, and 20,000 tons of eggs. At present the export of cattle to. Germany is limited, to 7,000 head per week.- - * The Foreign Office records show thai 60 steamers have been given clearance for Norway since the Sth of -February, ami that of these 40 had sailed before 3St.li March.
tCHINA.On the loth instant Mr. Alston reported that the German troops in Peking and Tientsin had been disarmed. German subjects in China had been warned by the Netherlands Minister to keep the peace ; ho trouble of any kind is apprehended, from them. It is proposed to repatriate the German, diplomatic and consular officials via the United States and Holland, and, in the event of China declaring war, that all other German subjects should be interned. Internment in Siberia has been suggested, but it is understood that the Russian Government are opposed to the idea; the Japanese Government are in favour of internment at the Treaty Port Concessions under foreign police supervision. The French Government propose that the disposal of enemy persons and property in the International settlement at Shanghai be entrusted by the Chinese Government to the Allied Consuls, and that 1 the German. Concessions at Hankow and Tientsin (over which China has apparently resumed control) shall become International settlements on the Shanghai model. These questions remain, for decision, if and when necessary, by the representatives of the Allies at Peking in consultation with the Chinese Government.The Inspector-General of the Chinese Maritime Customs (Mr. Agleii) understands that the Japanese will shortly put forward, a proposal, to replace the 1.47 Germans and Austrian^ in that Service by Japanese employes. He considers that these vacancies should be distributed amongst all Allied and neutral nationalities and that so large an influx of Japanese would demoralise the Service; at the same time, the Japanese proposal is made on plausible grounds in view of the difficulty of recruiting new staff elsewhere. The Inspector-General, asks what number of candidates could be furnished by the British War Office or Admiralty.On the I I tlx instant, the Prime Minister at Peking submitted, to the Allied representatives the Chinese GoveanmenPs demand in connection with the remission of Indemnity payments, revision, of tariff and other questions. These the Ministers -were unable to discuss without further information as to the nature and scope of Chinas rupture with the Central Empires. The demands included the suspension of Boxer Indemnity payments for a period of 10 years, a surtax of 50 per cent, on the present import duties (pending revision of the tariff to an effective 71- per cent. ad valorem), and the removal of the foreign troops from Peking and the Northern Railway. In. return, China would undertake to assist the Allies with&apos; raw materials and labour. Referring to these proposals, His Majesty&apos;s Government have intimated, that the Powers are not prepared to negotiate in. regard to any such substantial, concessions except in return, for a declaration of Avar by China against Germany arid Austria-Hungary, to be followed by the expulsion or internment of all German and Austrian subjects, and. the sequestration of all. enemy property. The Japanese Government propose, subject to China&apos;s declaration of war, to agree to suspension of the Indemnities until the end of the Avar, and to a modification of the tariff up to a 5 per cent, effective.MEXICO.Mr. Thurstan reports that Germans in considerable numbers are arriving in. Mexico from the United States. On the 20th March &apos; he telegraphed that a wireless installation under the direct control of Sehor Carranza is, being erected at Mexico City. A 400 feet mast is in position, but the electrical machinery is at present defective and of limited range. The Chief Engineer of the Teiefunkeu system is reported to be at work on this plant, which is closely guarded by soldiers.Sir 0. Spring-Rice states that the United States Government regard the attitude of Carranza as unsatisfactory, inasmuch as he does not frankly repudiate German intrigues, but endeavours to pose as a central figure in international, diplomacy. It is thought at Washington, however, that his policy has created such widespread discontent and opposition in. Mexico, that both he and his arbitrary new Constitution may not last much longer.UNITED STATES.The question of the possible purchase of the American-Transatlantic liners by the United States Shipping Board.(vide last week&apos;s Summary) has been settled, the French Government having bought the seven uncaptured vessels, with, the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Proceedings in the British Prize Court against the three captured ships have been adjourned till the -2nd of April.
His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington has been instructed to communicate to the State Department the apprehensions felt by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to railway strikes in the United States possibly affecting the movement of war materials and supplies, and to express the hope that the United States Government will be able and willing to continue their present considerate policy of not disturbing contracts in process of fulfilment for the Allies.0 Sir C. Spring-Ripe has also been directed to suggest that the United States Government should take steps to prevent the enemy from obtaining financial assistance from the United. States by 1) prohibiting the transmission of wireless messages to the enemy, either - direct or through neutrals; (2) forbidding transactions in enemy-owned securities ; (3) placing an embargo on German balances in American banks, and (4) closely supervising ail remittances abroad. Control of wireless is regarded as of the highest importance.Financial measures, of a nature calculated to assist the Allies, are being considered by the United States Government, and. discussed with the British and French financial agents in America. It has been proposed by the President of the Federal. Reserve Board that the United. States Government should either guarantee certain Allied loans or that it should declare that Allied loans will be treated on the same footing as American, loans as regards exemption from taxes, &amp;c.Telegraphing on the 17th instant, Sir C, Spring-Rice reported an unofficial opinion of the State Department that without a declaration, of war having occurred upon the &quot; overt act &quot; of the sinking of the &quot; Algonquin,&quot; the two countries are actually drifting into a de facto state of: war. Also, that although the United States would go to war solely in defence of American rights, the common cause must speedily be recognised and American forces brought into effective co-operation with the Allies.Two American liners, the &quot; Manchuria &quot; and the &quot; St. Louis,&quot; armed fore and aft, left New York on the .16th and 17th respectively. The attention of the State Department has been drawn by Sir G. Spring-Rice to the inadvisability of publishing the Customs return of vessels sailing from Panama and other American ports.GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.Between the upper and the nether millstones of German, intimidation and England&apos;s silent pressure, the position of the neutral Powers is becoming more and more difficult. The main result of the submarine campaign, directed against Great Britain is a practical blockade of Sweden, Denmark and Holland, whose shipowners have allowed themselves to be influenced by German propaganda and by con-si derations of the ultimate profit to be gained by the avoidance of present risks. But public opinion in these countries is apparently beginning to realise that the shipowners&apos; interests are likely to come into conflict with national needs, for in all of them the food question is becoming serious. Both in Holland and in Denmark it is also realised that the curtailment of imported cattle fodder and fertilisers will compel farmers to slaughter and sell to Germany a considerable portion of their live stock, and thus greatly diminish the countries&apos; productive capacity.In Holland a strong anti-German feeling appears to be growing amongst the working classes, because of the increased cost of living. A popular demonstration, at the Hague on the 18th instant protested against further exports of food from Holland. On the 15th Sir W. Towniey urged that, in view of the urgency of the food problem, an early decision should be communicated by the British Government in regard to the route to be followed by the Dutch grain vessels.awaiting clearance in ballast for the United States. As a concession to the Dutch Government, these ships have now been exempted from calling at a port in the United Kingdom ami permitted to proceed for inspection at Halifax. A limited number of vessels with fodder and fertilisers for Holland, are also being gradually released. These concessions are made in the hope and belief that the Netherlands Government are seeking for a way to meet us, whilst avoiding a serious crisis with Germany, in the question of admitting armed merchantmen to their ports.In accordance with the recommendations submitted by Sir l&apos;k Howard (vide last week&apos;s Summary), Swedish shipowners have been informed that any ships arriving in the United Kingdom with approved cargoes will be allowed to return immediately with coal.   As regards Swedish ships at present detained in the United Kingdom,* The railway dispute was reported as settled on the 16th.
-they will be permitted to engage in the coal trade with France, pending the arrival of corresponding ships from Sweden or the release of the British ships now detained in the Baltic.His Majestys representative at Christiamia reported on the 15th instant that,-thanks to the British Governments liberal treatment of Norwegian shipowners and the advantages offered under the proposed scheme for coal licences and the employment of tonnage, he has hopes of being able to come to a satisfactory arrangement with the Shipowners&apos; Association in regard to the acquisition and. arming of vessels enrployed in the British-Norwegian trade. At the same time, he draws attention to the fact that his negotiations to this end are greatly prejudiced by the delays -which occur in granting licences and clearing vessels in England., and -urges that the cause of these delays (severely criticised by the Norwegian. Press) -should, be ascertained and, if possible, removed.0Danish shipowners, observing the comparative immunity of Norwegian traffic to Great Britain on the protected Bergen route, are taking heart of grace. Six Danish vessels sailed from that port on. the 17th and 3 8th instant. If they get over safely, it is expected that regular traffic in agricultural produce will he resumed. Under these circumstances, and upon the advice of Sir .11. Paget, His Majesty&apos;s Government have relaxed the general embargo on Danish shipping and have given permission for the release of a corresponding number of the Danish coal ships detained in. British ports, and for the gradual clearance at Halifax of vessels carrying fodder. At the same time, His Majesty-s Minister has been instructed to inform the Danish Government that the British Government are dissatisfied with, the figures of cattle exports to Germany, -and trust that, so soon as the supply of fodder has been secured by the resumption of traffic, these figures will immediately he reduced.As a general North Sea regulation, instructions have been issued that all ships calling at Halifax without permission will, in the absence of exceptional, circum-stances, be detained there until they have given an undertaking to proceed to Kirkwall for examination. Furthermore, shipowners desiring to avail themselves of the privilege of calling at a port outside the United Kingdom are required to under-take :  (1) That all their ships hitherto trading in Allied interests shall continue sailingand not be laid up ; and (2) that all their ships sailing from Scandinavia or Holland shall call at a UnitedKingdom port and load coal outwards, unless carrying a three-quarterscargo, or specially exempted.Finally, a definite course has been laid down for such neutral vessels, bound to Scandinavia or Holland, as may be exempted from calling at a port in. the United Kingdom.GENERAL.The French Government have decided to commence &quot; summer time &quot; from midnight on Saturday next-Through the Dutch Government, on the 15th instant, the Germans have renewed inquiries as to the British Governments intentions in regard to the projected repatriation of German totally incapacitated prisoners of war and interned civilians ; they express their willingness to continue to repatriate British subjects.According to the statement of a Danish sailor recently released from internment at Brandenburg camp, the conditions of the prisoners&apos; existence there are extremely bad. There are 6,000 French and about 5,000 Russians in the camp ; the English are represented by 60 merchant seamen and six bluejackets taken, in the J utland battle.

Townley to conve,y to the Netherlands Minister at Berlin a request that the camp be visited in the near future with special reference to the^e complaints.A.
