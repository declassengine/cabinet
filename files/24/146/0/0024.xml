SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED  WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT, No.  24.Canada.The Second Reading majority of 63 in favour of the Compulsory Service Bill shows English-speaking Canada almost solid in favour of the measure and French-speaking Canada equally solid against.   Under such conditions a very difficult situation may, easily arise.Fkance.M. Caillaux seems to have shown his hand too soon, and, for the moment, his manoeuvres have been foiled. But he will, no doubt, return to the charge at the next opportunity.Greece.The difficulty of the Italian occupation of Epirus looks like being solved by the tactful firmness of M. Jonnart and M. Venizelos. It remains to be seen, however, whether, even with a general acquiescence in their protectorate over Albania, the Italians will really be disposed to look with favour on a strong and united Greece, and may net find pretexts for making difficulty over the Epirot frontier or in. other ways.German Affairs.The political crisis, for the moment, obscures all other issues. While there is undoubtedly a genuine clement of desire for a more representative system of govern-ment, the element of arrangement &quot;from above&quot; is no less patent. The Pan-Germans and Conservatives with their ideas of annexing Belgium, Couiiand and half Africa, have long been a serious thorn in the flesh to the supreme authorities both in Germany and in Austria, who are agreed upon securing, as early as possible, a peace which will ensure to them the effective control of &quot;Middle Europe,&quot; including Turkey. They trust to the &quot; no annexations &quot; formula to secure the return of their Colonies, and to economic forces to draw Poland and a weakened Serbia and Roumania irresistibly into their orbit. Herr Erzberger, like Uerr Scheidemanii, may have been littering his own genuine Liberal convictions. But . he is also, consciously or unconsciously, an agent of the policy, which Befhmann-Hollweg and Czernin are agreed upon, with the approval of their respective sovereigns. We may reasonably expect a political revolution in Germany, but it will be the KaiseFs revolution and confined to such limits as he considers will serve his purpose.
Holland and Scandinavia.The-new United States export policy, coming on top of a series of other difficulties with us, e.(7., the new Admiralty mine held and the potato crisis in the. case of Holland, and the failure to secure an agricultural agreement in the case of&apos; Denmark, may, for the moment, create a strong wave of&apos;anti-Ally feeling in neutral countries. But there seems no reason to apprehend their taking any collective action hostile to Allied interests.United States.The American Treasury, in the shape of Mr. McAdoo, is not proving too accommodating,-anti is evidently out to use its opportunities to secure such disposable assets; c.gi. ships building&apos; in America,&apos; as we unay-still have,- and- to strengthen American industry at the expense of British or Canadian.     n.*i &apos; v    -v&apos;u...L.

FART I. BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL WAR CABINET.With reference to the offer of the British Government to forward to the Prime Minister of Australia a set of the secret papers that were circulated to- the members of the Imperial War Cabinet during the recent sittings, or, having regard to possible capture at sea, to retain them usati 1 Mr. Hughes visited England,1 a reply has been received from the Commonwealth Prime Minister to the effect that he does not anticipate visiting England at present. He therefore leaves it with the British authorities to decide upon the best method of sending the papers to Australia.IMPERIAL  CONFERENCE.Regarding the Resolution passed at the Imperial War Conference in favour of the representation of India at future Imperial Conferences,2 a reply has been received from the Canadian Government agreeing to the proposal.GENERAL.The United States Government have now agreed to grant facilities for the transport of Australian and New Zealand troops through the Panama Canal.3 The Governments of those Dominions have been notified accordingly, and asked to send their next troopships by that route. Meantime the Admiralty have asked to be supplied with information as to whether the vessels can cany sufficient coal to enable them to reach the Canal without bunkering en route.In reply the Australian Government have pointed out that their next transport, which is due to leave Sydney on 16th July, cannot be coaled so as to reach Panama without bunkering on the way. Under these circumstances, combined with the necessity of embarking a number of troops at Fremantle, it is proposed to send the ship via the Cape. For the future, however, arrangements are being reorganised, and troops concentrated in the Eastern States, in order to facilitate the next transports adopting the route via the Panama Canal.The Shipping Controller is obtaining from the Governments of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa priority lists for imports from the United States, so that vessels may be loaded with essentials, and all non-essentials excluded.The Board of Trade intend to appoint a special Committee to consider the matter of increasing the cotton supply of the Empire, and the Governments of Australia and South Africa have been asked if they will nominate representatives to serve on this -Committee.CANADA.In reply to the message from His Majesty the King4 the Governor-General has conveyed the gratification felt by the Dominion Government at the presence of the King and Queen in Westminster Abbey to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Confederation.1 See Western and General Report for week ending 30th May 1917. - See Western and General Report for week ending 25th April 1917. 3 See Western and General Report for week ending 27th June 1917. f See Western and General Report for week ending 4th July 1917.
The Division on the Second Reading of the Compulsory Service Bill was taken in the Dominion House of Commons on 6th -July, and resulted in a majority of 63 in favour of the measure. The majority for the Government included 26 Liberals, mostly representative of the Western and Maritime Provinces ; while the minority, voting with Sir Wilfrid Laurier and most of the French Canadians, included 12 English-speaking Liberals. The French-Canadian Conservatives -supporting con-scriptioh numbered 5 (vide Appendix to Report No. 20), and 12 voted with the Opposition. Sir Wilfrid Laurier&apos;s amendment in favour of a Referendum on the subject was defeated by a majority of 49. Before the Divisions had taken place, the Prime Minister announced certain figures to illustrate the necessity for conscription. He stated that the total infantry enlistments from January to May this year were 13,300, while the casualties in that branch of the Service during the same period amounted to 27,200. For April and May the infantry enlistments were 3,000, as compared with infantry casualties in those months of 21,300.The Minister of Militia (Sir Edward Kemp) explained to the House a discrepancy between the total enlistments and the number either sent overseas or remaining in Canada. He stated that 33,900 men had been discharged after enlistment as medically unfit, deserters numbered 13,000, while 1,700 had been irregularly attested, and nearly 6,000 were discharged on account of military inefficiency.The House proceeded to consider the Bill in Committee, and the Government, announced their expectation that they would obtain the 100,000 men required from the first two classes in the Bill, which consisted of unmarried men without dependants. Sir Wilfrid Laurier suggested that the maximum age of men liable for service should be reduced from 45 to 35 years, but the Prime Minister replied that there was little possibility of men of middle age being reached. The House of Commons has decided to sit during the mornings, in order to hasten the passage of the Bill; but up to 3rd July only three clauses had been passed.By a recent Canadian Order-in-Council it is made illegal, under heavy penalties, for any male person between the ages of IS and 45, who is ordinarily resident in the Dominion, to leave the country without the written, permission of the Canadian Immigration Inspector or other duly authorised authority.The Vancouver Board of Trade has asked the Dominion Government for financial assistance in order to organise the steel industry on the Pacific Coast. It is intended by this means to build up a permanent steel ship-building trade.As the Admiralty desire to arrange for the sailing of mercantile convoys from Sydney, they have asked the Dominion Government if they will extend facilities to the officer whom they propose to send to that port to act as their direct representative.It is proposed to hold a Conference to consider the type of rifle to be made in Canada, and Lieutenant-Colonel Folger has been nominated by the Acting High Commissioner to represent the Dominion at the Conference.His Majesty the King has approved of the issue of Imperial Silver War Badges to members of the Canadian Expeditionary Force under the conditions laid clown by the Canadian Order in Council of 16th May.NEWFOUNDLAND.The Government of the Colony have protested against the proposal to remove the Newfoundland Battalion now at Ayr to Barry. They consider that the officers and men are unanimously against removal, and that Ayr is particularly adapted to their, work and training. If the proposal is carried out it is believed that it would have a bad effect on recruiting.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has made a public pronouncement to the effect that his silence must not be taken to mean acquiescence with the view expressed by Mr. Lloyd George in his recent speech, in which he indicated that, in settling the fate of the German Colonies, the desires and wishes of their peoples must be the dominant
factor. Mr. Hughes added that Australia had a definite policy on the question of the control of the former German possessions in the Pacific, and that he would announce this later.The Prime Minister has expressed the willingness of the Commonwealth Govern-ment to receive the Germans of military age from Siam1 for internment in Australia, hut it is stated that no one can he received who is suffering from infectious disease. In view, however, of the length of voyage to Australia and the shipping difficulties, it -is suggested that India might be a more suitable place for internment.&apos; NEW ZEALAND.With regard to candidates of Maori blood being sent from the Canterbury Aviation School for admission to the Royal Flying Corps,1 the Army Council have informed the Dominion Government that it is not desirable to send such candidates to England unless the New Zealand authorities consider them suitable for commissions in their own contingents.The Governor-General reports (7th July) that the number of troops in training amounts to 11,500 including 196 Maoris. There are 1,15-1 voluntary recruits not yet called up for training. The voluntary system of recruiting has now been suspended as the compulsory provisions of the Military Service Act are in operation.RHODESIA.Satisfactory progress in the training of the Rhodesian native units has been made and it is anticipated that they will be able to proceed on active service towards the end of August, after going through a musketry course. The latter, however, cannot be proceeded with until the arrival of the rifles for which they are still waiting.BASUTOLAND.Recruiting for the Labour Contingent has not proved successful, and sufficient men have not yet been enrolled to form one company. It appears that the Chiefs are not helping to the extent that was anticipated from the favourable attitude they adopted in the Council. The Resident Commissioner is stated by the High Commis-sioner to be doing everything possible, and, if failure to recruit the four Basuto companies results, the blame will attach to the Chiefs.GOLD COAST.The Governor reports that great reductions in the civil establishment have taken place in order to release men for service. If the few who might still be spared, are also sent, there must be a sacrifice of efficiency. In any case, he thinks that a very small, number of the officials, or those engaged in. commercial work, who now remain, would be suitable for commissions, and that compulsory7 measures would not produce more than about 20 men.BRITISH HONDURAS.As a result of a Conference which has been held to consider the requirements of the Allies in respect of mahogany for aeroplane construction, the Government of British Honduras have been informed that, owing to the high quality of the mahogany produced in the Colony, steps should be taken to see if the supply can be increased. The Governor has therefore been asked to consult the principal producers.WINDWARD ISLANDS.The Secretary of State for the Colonies has intimated to the Governor that the Military Service Bill may now be finally passed.1 See Western and General Report for week ending 27th June 1917. 3441- -2 &quot;B
The Governor has urged that the Shipping Controller should not be influenced by-private bodies such as the West India Committee in regard to shipment of cargoes. He states that the Trinidad and Tobago planters have gained a great deal over the Grenada planters as a result of the influence brought to bear by this Committee, and he submits, that there should be equal treatment extended to all the West Indian Colonies.PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ALLIED COMMON AFFAIRS.The 16th of July was the date finally proposed by the French Government for the Conference to be held in Paris, at which the situation in the Balkans and the occupation of Macedonia are to be discussed. At the request of Baron Sonnino, it has since been agreed to postpone the date to the 25th of July, as the session of the Italian Parliament is likely to be prolonged beyond the date anticipated. The French Government anticipate that it may be difficult to restrict the discussion of affairs and their bearing on the general conduct of the war, within the limits desired by the Russian Government.FRANCE.Lord Bertie has received information from a reliable source to the effect that no representations will be addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the lengthening of the British front in France until after the impending British offensive. In this connection he reports that Monsieur Clemenceau has severely criticised the disclosures made at the secret session of the Chamber as to the bad condition of the French Army and the need for calling upon England for assistance.At the public sitting of the Chamber on &apos;7th July several allusions were made to the &quot; unseen hand &quot; and its evil influence on the April offensive ; several Socialist deputies referred to the President of the Republic by name. M. Painleve, in. a speech which was applauded by the whole Chamber, admitted that faults had been committed and promised that the military officers responsible for them would be punished.M. Painleve alluded in scathing terms to the pacifist campaign, his remarks being evidently directed, at Mi Caillaux, who chafed visibly under the attack. Lord Bertie is informed that the Government has evidence that the &quot; Bonnet Rouge,&quot; a journal closely identified with M. Caillaux&apos;s peace propaganda, has been receiving funds from. German Banks in Switzerland.   One of the staff has been arrested.On the 9th July an Order was published in the Official Journal, prohibiting the importation, of all foreign goods into France except under special license.BELGIUM.The Belgian Minister has made earnest representations to the Foreign Office protesting against the closing by the British Admiralty of the last narrow passage by which goods can enter Holland from the north. He points out that this measure, if maintained, must deprive Belgium and the North of France of their requisite supplies of food. Apart from this measure, the position of Belgian relief is serious owing to the small amount of tonnage available. The actual deficit is estimated at 60,000 tons a month ; it is hoped that the negotiations with Holland now proceeding may result in providing a portion of it at least.Steps have been taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the protection of the-Relief Commission^ ships alreadv at sea and en route for Holland (vide also under &quot; Holland &quot; and &quot;The Shipping Situation &quot;).ITALY.The Italian Government, through their delegate on the London Rationing Commission, have requested His Majesty&apos;s Government to consent to raise the silk imports into the United Ringdom from the 50 per cent, limit to 70 per cent. ; they
justify this request by reason of the concessions made by tliem in the agreement recently concluded concerning Italian silk exports to Switzerland.Per contra, His Majesty&apos;a Government are seriously concerned at the delay of the Italian Government in ratifying the Swiss cattle agreement (vide Report No. 16). A bad impression has been created by their failure to deliver the stipulated quantities of oil cake. On 5th July Sir R. Rodd was instructed to press for an early settlement of this question ; he reported that the delay has been caused by internal re-orgauisa-tion in the Department concerned and that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was endeavouring to expedite matters. On the 7th he conveyed an explanation of the Italian Governments position in the matter, showing that on two subsidiary points there remains a difference of opinion, e.g., the Italians insist on retaining glycerine to which the Swiss lay claim. They are prepared to send a delegate to Berne to discuss matters and meanwhile consider that the formal ratification of the agreement is comparatively unimportant. In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Swiss are entitled to claim the glycerine under the terms of the agreement. Sir R. Rodd has been instructed to express the hope that the matter may be discussed and settled at Paris, as transference to Berne would lead to fresh complications.On 3rd July the Italian Government asked for certain grrarantees in regard to the proposed employment of Egyptian labour companies at Taranto, fearing lest enemy agents might be introduced amongst these labourers, to the danger of the naval station and arsenal. As a result of a misunderstanding of mistake, it appears that these labour companies had been despatched from Egypt without the necessary sanction having been issued by the Italian authorities. The Alinister of Marine therefore informed His M.ajesty&apos;s Ambassador (5th Jrdy) that they would be consigned to certain restricted areas until the question had. been discussed and definitely settled. Sir R. Wingate expressed the opinion that no serious danger would attach to the employment of Egyptian labour at Taranto; it has worked satisfactorily in France, Sinai and Mesopotamia. On the 9th Sir R. Rodd announced that the question had Been satisfactorily settled.GREECE.On 4th July General Sarrail came to Athens and having summoned the heads of the Allied Military Controls, informed them that their Mission was at an end. It has been arranged that the Military Attaches of the Allied Legations will co-operate in the re-organisation and equipment of the Greek Army. Gn 10th July Lord. Bertie reported that, in the opinion of the French Government, based on that of M. Jonnart :and General Sarrail. the time has come to avoid all action derogatory to the dignity and authority of the friendly Greek nation ; the French representatives in London, Rome and Petrograd have therefore been instructed to urge the Allied Governments to agree to the abolition of the Controls, a form of surveillance no longer justified by the facts of the situation.The High Commissioner left Athens for France on 7th July ; it was understood that M. Clausse would act for him during his absence, with functions and status to he arranged between the British and French Governments. M. Jonnart expects to visit London after a short stay in Paris.Before leavhig, M. Jonnart came to an understanding with M. Venizelos on the subject of the joint evacuation of Epirus by the Italian and French forces. On 4-th July the Italian Alinister at Athens had informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Italian troops would be withdrawn from Epirus without awaiting the withdrawal of the French contingents in Attica and the Gulf of Corinth. On the following day the High Commissioner, in agreement with General Sarrail, replied to enquiries by AI. A^enizelos on the subject, and announced that the French forces in the Ionian islands and on the mainland could be withdrawn in a fortnight; the Italian Minister thought that his Government would agree to simultaneous evacuation by the Italian troops. In conversation with Mr. Crackauthorpe, however, he stated (5th July) that while he had. advised his Government in this sense, difficulties might possibly -arise with regard to three subsidiary questions, namely (1) General Sarraiks expressed intention to leave French cavalry patrols along the Larissa-Bralo-Itea line, (2) the Governorship of Corfu, and (3) Mount Athos. As regards (1) AI. Venizelos has suggested the participation of Italian cavalry in these patrols. With reference to (2) M. Jonnart, on learning of the Italian Ministers views from Mr. Crackanthorpe, telegraphed to Paris advising the abolition of the Governorship and the withdrawal of
both French and Italian, contingents. As regards (3) Mr. Orackanthorpe understood that General Sarrail was very well disposed in this matter. On 10th July the Greek Minister in London officially informed His Majesty&apos;s Government that, as the result of an understanding between the High Commissioner, the Italian Minister and M. Venizelos, the Italian evacuation of Epirus would take place simultaneously with the French evacuation of occupied territory and the Ionian Islands, excluding Corfu, Thassos, Milos and the zone of the Salonika Armies. His Majesty&apos;s Government have expressed to the French Government the hope that arrangements for evacuation on these lines may speedily be concluded.In conversation with M. Venizelos, the Italian Minister spoke frankly of the ill-feeling which had been created by the French occupation of Greece. While fully recognising the just and moderate attitude of the High Commissioner, he still apprehends trouble from certain French extremists. The abolition of the military control he regarded as reassuring; Italian policy, he declared, is at one with that of M. Venizelos is desiring that Greece shall be, relieved of all foreign intervention. Mr. Crackanthorpe has drawn Mr. Clausse&apos;s attention to the danger of friction being maintained as the result of the tendency shown by a section of the French Press at Athens to emphasise unduly the preponderant part played by France in restoring the unity of Greece. Mr. Clausse concurred in deploring these misguided activities and agreed to give instructions which will restrain the ardour of his nationals and emphasise the solidarity of the Allies.An announcement lias been published in the Greek Press that a Royal Decree will shortly be issued, summoning the Chamber elected on 13th June 1915, to meet again on 25th July. A report was current on the 9th that an Anglo-French loan to Greece is impending, of 4,000,0001.In the course of replies to questions in the Chamber during the sitting of 7th-8th July, M. Ribot announced that the Salonika front would neither be abandoned nor shortened. In this connection the attitude of the Russian Provisional Govern-ment is noteworthy. They have published in the Russian Press their instructions to their representatives at the forthcoming Balkans Conference in Paris, which require them to insist on the application of the general principles laid clown by Russian democracy in regard to foreign affairs. The fact is also published that, disapproving of the deposition of King Constantine as an unjustifiable intervention in tlie internal affairs of Greece, they have refused to allow Russian troops to be employed in Southern Greece.According to information supplied, by His Majesty&apos;s Naval. Attache at Athens, there is a strong desire on the part of the Greek Minister of Marine that the French naval authorities should restore the ships taken from the Greek Navy, and also for the establishment of a Greek Naval zone. Negotiations are in progress ; the French seem disposed to hand back the five torpedo boats at present used for the Gulf of Athens patrol, but to retain, control of the twelve destroyers based on Corfu. In the opinion of many Greek officers, the Ministry of Marine, as at&apos; present constituted, is not capable of administering even a small Naval zone ; they consider that some sort of British control and expert assistance would be absolutely necessary. The Minister of Marine is busily engaged in making drastic changes in the personnel of the Navy ; in order to make room for returning Venezeiists, a number of Royalist officers are being arbitrarily retired.Mr. Crackanthorpe reported on the 9th July that a strong feeling exists in Government and private circles at Athens that Greece, although now to all intents and purposes an Ally, is not being fairly treated as regards reasonable facilities for obtaining urgently necessary supplies. It is felt, in particular, that Great Britain is dealing hardly with her in the matter of shipping, in view of the fact that almost the whole tonnage of the country has been requisitioned for the purposes of the Allies. This feeling has recently been accentuated by the prohibition of rice exports from Egypt and by the fact that the French propose to retain under requisition some 20,000 tons of small coasting vessels, leaving barely 10,000 tons for the service of the Greek Government.   Mr. Crackanthorpe suggests certain alleviating measures.The General Officer Commanding at Salonika has suggested, with a view to the ultimate saving of tonnage, that he should acquire land for the growing of oats, barley, &amp;c.GERMAN AFFAIRS.Herr von Backer, President of the War Food Committee, said that the two most critical months of the year are June and July.   This year the normal supply of fruit
and vegetables had been somewhat affected by the drought in certain parts of the country. There was no longer any fear of a further reduction in the bread ration. The present scale cotdd be maintained and would be increased from the beginning or middle of August. The extra meat ration would then be reduced, so as to save the milch cows. As to the harvest, the co-operation of all classes of people with the War Food Committee was of the greatest value ; much had been learned from experience and the nation might look forward to the supplies from the new harvest with complete confidence.Two British officers escaped from Germany, who arrived at The Hague on 6th July, described the German war bread as very bad, of a glutinous clay-like quality. The price of tea was 24s: a pound, and a tin of bully beef worth 6s.According to* the &quot; Miinchener Zeitung,&quot; the recent decision of the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; (27th June) to cease from publishing leading articles on current events, was brought about by the Censors refusal to allow them to have material from Vienna, heretofore the &quot; Frankfurter^ &quot; most accurate source of independent information. This suppression of Viennese news is interpreted as evidence of increasing political friction between Germany and Austria.The public declarations of Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson with regard to the democratisation of Germany as a condition essential to the discussion of peace terms, seem to have sunk deep in certain political circles. Sir W. Townley sees evidence of this in the activities of Herr Dernburg and Professor Delbruck, whose public manifesto and democratic peace programme were regarded as preliminary to a campaign for forcing the issues of internal reform in the. Reichstag. The &quot; Vorwarts &quot; 7th duly summed up the political situation by declaring i &quot; It cannot go on. In the &quot; Reichstag the Right and Left are, clamouring for change, each along its own line. &quot; In the facing-both-ways Centre, increasing uncertainty and confusion prevail, which &quot; threaten to turn to despair.&quot; On the Sth, the Chancellor, invited by all parties to attend the meeting of the Reichstag Committee, declined to commit himself to the principle of a peace without annexations or indemnities. The temper of the House, as shown during the subsequent debate, appeared to be hostile to the Government and disposed towards the formation of a Coalition Cabinet. On the 9th the Press reverberated loudly with the echoes of Herr ErzbergeFs speech and- reflected the growing excitement, real or inspired, of the political parties. The Catholic Centre was described as determined to follow Erzberger into the camp of the Left, insisting upon constitutional reforms as the only means of bridging the &quot; cultural&quot; chasm which prevents Germany from coming to terms with her enemies and retaining the friendship of neutrals. There was much speculation as to the impending-results of the KaiseFs conferences with the Chancellor and Hindenburg after his return from Vienna on the 7th. An article by Prince Lichnowsky in the &quot; Berliner Tageblatt &quot; declared that constitutional changes on democratic lines have become imperative, together with alteration in the existing relations between the Empire and the Federated States. A Crown Council was held under the presidency of the Raiser at the Chancellor&apos;s palace on the 9th, attended by the Prussian, and State Ministers and Imperial Secretaries. There were rumours that the resignations of Secretaries Helfferich and Zimmerman had been accepted, but the Press on the 10th reflected an. official, mot d&apos;ordre to contradict the idea of a crisis and to avoid all statements concerning the failure of the U-boat campaign.Nevertheless, a crisis there is, a summer sale of Junker stock accompanied by democratic window dressing on a lavish scale. The German Press of the 9th was busy with forecasts of a Coalition Ministry of all the talents, which is to demonstrate the solidarity existing between the Government, the Chancellor, and the people. The resignation of five Junker members of the Prussian Ministry was announced, as the result of the decision of the Kaiser and Chancellor to introduce the promised Franchise Bill during the autumn session of the Prussian Lower House. The &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; of the 9th expressed the hope that these beginnings of reform might not prove to be half measures. It appealed to the Chancellor, without regard to the Pan-German faction, to declare frankly that Germany has no intention of annexing Belgium or retaining any form of authority over the Belgian people. The &quot; Kolnische Volkszeitung &quot; (annexationist) ascribes the crisis and the OhaucelloFs unpopularity to the natioiPs desire for peace, which in its turn is due to the Governments food-control policy. The &quot; Vossisclie &quot; of the 9th says that the Reichstag will adjourn without passing the vote of credit if the party leaders find their peace-and-reform. views opposed by the Chancellor.y-wi-2 C
AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.  ,   :- A Report issued bv the Intelligence Bureau (6th July) states that arrangements have now been completed, for the enrolment and despatch to the French front of a Bohemian army, recruited from the Czech prisoners in Russia, It is hoped to raise the strength of this army to something between 30,000 and 40,0.00 men ; they will have their own. flag, organisation and insignia, and a French General will be assigned to command them as a distinctly national Bohemian force. Negotiations have also been successfully conducted between the Czech Council in Paris and the Italian Govern-ment; they are expected to add to this army some 10,000 Czech prisoners now in Italy. Finally, Mr. Stefanik, a member of the Czech National Council, who initiated the arrangements with the French Government, has gone to Washington to discuss with the American Government the raising of a Bohemian contingent amongst the non-naturalised Czechs and Slovaks in the United States. Two hundred Czechs, recruited from the small colony in London, are now serving with the British Army, and another contingent is enrolled in the Canadian Force. There is also a special Czech contingent in the French Army. &apos;Competent observers attribute the amnesty accorded to political offenders by the Emperor Charles to pressure exercised by the German Military Commanders, The conciliatory attitude adopted by Germans in Germauy towards the Western Slavs, and particularly towards the Czechs, has long been noticed. Even a section of the Pan-Germans realise the growing strength of tlie national movement in Bohemia.(For further information on the Czech question, vide Intelligence Bureau&apos;,s Report on Austria-Hungary, No, VTIL, of 7th July.)HOLLAND.The potato question continues to provide material for public disturbances and political dissension.&apos; The much discussed utterance on the subject by the Alinister of Agriculture to a deputation at Amsterdam led Sir W. Townley to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs for an explanation. On 4th July this was forthcoming, to the effect that M. Posthuma had been misrepresented in the Press. What he actually said was that &quot; England sends hardly any coal to Holland at present, but all the same must get &quot; her share of potatoes, according to agreement, if we send any to Germany, and this &quot; we must do if we wish to receive the coal supply, of which we are in absolute &quot; need.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Minister, while accepting this modification, replied that it was not of a nature to allay the irritation created in Great Britain by this question. The opinion was prevalent in certain quarters that the provocative attitude of the Minister of Agriculture was inspired by a group of politicians whose object it is to force Holland to throw in her lot with Germany. The utterances of the German Press on the subject lend colour to this opinion. From the 4th to the 6th of July it contained reiterated accusations against the British Government of having instigated the Amsterdam riots in order to force Holland to abandon her neutrality. Public opinion at The Hague, as expressed by a demonstration on the 6th, was by no means in sympathy with the attitude of the Minister of Agriculture or the objects of the pro-German party in the Cabinet. On 7th July His Majesty&apos;s Government directed Sir W. Townley to say that they regard Mr. Posthuma&apos;s statement as a deliberate attempt by a member of the Dutch Government to create a feeling of hostility against England, and that, unless his action is disavowed, His majesty&apos;s Government must draw their own conclusions as to the attitude which the Dutch Government desire to assume. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in reply, assured Sir W. Townley that Mr. Posthuma bad no intention of stirring up ill-feeling against England. His action had been clumsy but not hostile.The &quot; Nieuwe Courant,&quot; discussing the motives which have led Great Britain to close,access to the high seas to Dutch shipping, suggests that this measure has been taken by the British Admiralty in order to expedite and stiffen action on the part of the United States in the matter of the allied blockade. So deep is the public apprehension ereated by this measure, that on the 7th July, Her Majesty the Queen of Holland telegraphed to His Majesty King George a personal appeal for its reconsideration ; the Netherlands Minister in London had lodged a strong protest on the subject two da-ys before. He was verbally assured in reply that the action taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government was not directed against Holland, but solely against German submarines and their piratical policy ; the Dutch Governments protest should be addressed
to Germany.. On the 9th the Foreign Office addressed a Note to His Excellency explaining and justifying the laying of the new minefield from Heligoland Bight as a perfectly legitimate operation of war, intended to he of benefit to neutrals. The Note ended with an expression of the regret felt by His Majesty&apos;s Government at observing influences in Holland which endeavour to fasten on to Great Britain blame for evils directly due to the action of Germany. On the 11th, Sir W. Townley reported that the Minister for Foreign. Affairs quite concurred in blaming Germany for the situation and would make representations in Berlin. Pending negotiations on the :subject,t, he asked, however, that some plan be devised for giving Dutch traders safe passage to the open sea,.The British agents charged with tlie direction of business arising out of the agricultural agreement in Holland have reported that unless they are immediately authorised by His Majesty&apos;s Government to declare and exercise an option on the British share of the fruit and vegetable crops, these will go in their entirety to -Germany. Sir W. IVwnley recommends that the necessary financial arrangements be made at once to permit of the British option being exercised before it is too late, so that the present large exports to Germany may be stopped.Sir W. Townley reported on the 10th. that the question of the internment of German, submarines, at issue betAveen the Dutch and German Governments since February and at one time a cause of serious friction, has uoav been settled. An. International technical Commission (German, Dutch, Danish, SAvedish and Argentine naval officers) will decide whether all proper precautions were taken to avoid Dutch territorial waters.SWEDEN.The State Unemployment Commission have drawn the attention,of the Swedish Government to the fact that many industries are gravely threatened by lack ,of raw materials. The cotton and jute factories will have to close nt the end of this month. The Commission recommends an immediate diversion of labour from the factories to the fields.Referring to the action, impending by the United States to tighten the blockade on Germany by prohibiting exports of foodstuffs and raw material to Scandinavia, His Majesty&apos;s Government have suggested that the United States -Government should make it an essential condition for alloAving future supplies to go to Sweden that no more iron, ore or other&quot; munitions material shall be exported from Sweden to Germany. In this connection, a confidential Report from His Majesty&apos;s Commercial Attache at The Hague states that since 1st May the Germans, have sldpped 465,000 tons of iron ore from Eulea and Oxelosund. They hope to ship 21- million tons this season, a supply sufficient to last till the end of 1918. The ore is conveyed chiefly to Eubeck, Plamburg, and Emden. The same Report states that since the torpedoing of the German collier &apos;&quot;&apos; Westphalia,&quot; the -traffic between Rotterdam and G-erman Baltic ports has been suspended, and over 40 ships are now lying -at Rotterdam. It is thought that if one or two ore carriers ay ere sunk in the Baltic the results to the German munition trade would be immediate and serious.NORWAY.A Norwegian Mission to America, under Dr. F. Nansen, will leave-Christiania on the 13th of July. Dr. Nansen has asked that if the vessel carrying the Mission is detained at Halifax, he may be permitted to proceed overland to the United States. His.Majesty&apos;s Government, in reply, have expressed their regret at being unable to make any exception to the general rule, to which the Naval authorities attach special importance.DENMARK.In reply to a written enquiry, His Majesty&apos;s Government have informed the Danish Minister that no further facilities can be afforded for shipments of cereals and fodder to Denmark, and no letters of assurance are being issued for such consignments from the United States. The Danish Minister, having expressed surprise at this decision (7th July), His Majesty&apos;s Government further explained that they had been confirmed in the policy since the failure of the recent-negotiations had comdnced them that the Danish. Government -were not prepared to give definite assurances with regard to-
limiting the export of fats and live stock to Germany. On this point the Danes: justify their action by the argument that in the face of greatly diminished fodder supply it was not possible to prevent farmers from selling their beasts. The export of cattle is limited at present to 6,000 head a week.Danish shipowners have expressed the fear that, having obtained the disposal of all surplus Danish tonnage by the recently concluded agreement, His Majesty&apos;.s Government may niake practically all Danish tonnage &quot; surplus&quot; by refusing-facilities for various kinds of cargoes. Sir R. Paget has been confidentially informed that for the present there is no intention to withdraw any other agreed rations, but His Majesty&apos;s Government can make no. announcement of policy without further knowledge of the scope and date of the measures about to be taken by the United States.As regards the If) fodder ships detained in American ports, Sir R. Paget has been instructed to advise that these cargoes should either be sold in the United States or that the Danish Government should consider the question of disposing of them to the food-purchasing authorities in the United Kingdom.SPAIN.In a despatch dated 20th June Sir A. Hardinge summarises the substance of a conversation held by him on that day with Seiior Dato, the new Prime Minister. Referring to the attitude of the Germans towards his Government, he said their reptile Press had commenced attacking it, and. particularly the Marquess of Lema, with weapons of calumny and vilification similar to those which they had employed against Count Romanones. Their object is to bring about a Ministry in which would, be combined the Germanophii elements of the Left and Right, a so-called &quot;National Government,&quot; in which the Mauristas and Ciervistas would unite with the dissentient Liberals under Seiior Villanueva. Sir A. Hardinge thinks this German policy is part of their system of terrorism, not entirely unsuccessful in a country where statesmen are timid and public opinion sharply divided.On 5th July the American Ambassador at Madrid informed His Majesty the King that such supplies as the United States can dispose of are provisionally reserved for the Allies. If there should be a surplus after their wants are met, Spain would receive her share, provided her policy is friendly to the Allied cause. This frank statement was well received bj&apos; His Majesty. *The Army has been gratified by the removal of all the unpopular individuals in the King&apos;s Military Household. Sir A. Hardinge understands that the majority of the officers are opposed to the revolutionary movement and that the danger of a new political crisis is at least deferred. At the same time there is evidence of organised work by French revolutionary agents amongst the Spanish Republicans, and the movement for Catalan autonomy is believed to owe something of its activity to the inspiration of the ultra-Radical element in France. Although the question of Monarchy versus Republic is not directly raised, the Catalans demand a revision of the Constitution and autonomy for the sixteen federal &quot; States&quot; contemplated by the Republican Constitution of 1873.On 5th July His Majesty&apos;s Government informed Sir A. Hardinge of their con-curreuce in a proposal by the French Government, that the Allies should take note of the Spanish undertaking to exclude submarines from Spanish waters, and. at the same time express regret at the release of the &quot; U.C. 52.&quot; Both the French Ambassador at Madrid and Sir A. Hardinge deprecated this proposal, as calculated to discourage the Spanish Government (as good a one as the Allies are likely to get) at a time of great -anxiety and difficulty.CHINA.The Manchu dynasty, restored to the Throne against its will by General Chang listin, has enjoj^ed but a little brief authority. The young emperor&apos;s re-abdication was announced on 7th. July. The information received from China throws no light on. the causes of Chang Hsiiibs precipitate action ; according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Tokio, German money and intrigue may have had something to do with it, but the coup d-etat was quite unexpected, for Chang had &quot; practically promised &quot; General Tanaka not to press his restoration scheme for the present.   As events have proved, he would have been wise net to do so, for he had
neither the force nor the funds to overcome the inevitable opposition of rival military governors and political factions.On 5th July Chang-found himself with 6,000 or 7,000 troops faced with the prospect of an immediate attach by the forces of Tuan Chi-jui (the Ex-Premier) advancing from Tientsin and those of the Governor of Chihli coming from Paoting-fu. On. the 6th, two of his regiments went over to the Republicans and announced their defection by sending an aeroplane to drop bombs on their late Chiefs headquarters in the Imperial City. Such lighting as occurred on the railway line between Tientsin and Peking was half-hearted ; the Imperialists appear to have realised at the outset that they were on the losing side. As the result of representations addressed by His Majesty&apos;s Minister to the Commanders on both sides, arrangements were made for the conveyance to Peking of reinforcements for the Legation Guards and for maintenance of ordinary passenger traffic through the opposing lines. The Imperialists withdrew to within the city walls on. the night of the 7th, whereupon Chang Msiin intimated his desire to seek refuge in. the British Legation and his readiness to disband his troops on condition that his life should be spared. After consultation with his Japanese colleague, Mr. Alston conveyed a message to Tuan Chi-jui, through His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Tientsin, suggesting that Chang&apos;s surrender be accepted, leaving him his life and property. On the Sth, Chang Hsuids resignation of all his offices was gazetted. On the 9th, Tuan. Chi-jui replied, declining to negotiate with Chang Hstinbut intimating that, should lie see fit to take sanctuary in a foreign Legation, his property would be respected and his troops disbanded. The Allied Ministers thereupon agreed to advise the Imperialist representative that to prevent bloodshed, Chang should lay down his arms..... A significant feature of. the situation is that Tuan Chi-jui has issued a manifesto intimating that the Imperial Manchu family will not be held responsible for Changes coup sVetat, and that they will continue to receive the treatment guaranteed to them by the founders of the Republic.As regards the immediate future, the Japanese Government consider that the ex-President (now a refugee in the Japanese Legation) is not likely to count as a factor. A compromise on the usual lines between the political parties may be expected, the balance of power remaining with Yice-President Peng and his troops at blanking. The &quot; Republican &quot; regime will be restored under the direction of Tuan and his friends ; on the other hand, in. view of Tuaifs manifesto above mentioned, the possibility of a Constitutional Monarchy (desirable from the Japanese point of view) cannot be excluded. As regards China&apos;s foreign policy and the war, the Allied Ministers at Peking took occasion on 7th J uly to convey a joint message verbally to Tuan, to,the effect that the sympathies of the Allied. Powers will be with the head of the State in China who is ready to declare war on Germany and Austria without further delay. On the 10th of July, Tuan replied that his policy of declaring war on the side &quot;of the Allies remains unchanged..  ARGENTINA.... Prom official sources the Foreign Office is informed that the Argentine Government recently sent an invitation to the American naval squadron at Rio to visit Buenos Aires, offering to send a squadron to meet them en route. The invitation was declined, on the ground that German agents are actively employed in Argentina in a manner contrary to the interests of the Allies.Bolivia, having declined the invitation to attend the forthcoming neutral Congress at Buenos Aires, is now reported to be endeavouring to persuade Peru to follow suit.MEXICO,The British and United States Governments, after consultation, are agreed that it is inexpedient to address a general, protest to the Mexican Government on the subject of the new Constitution, and that each and every concrete violation of Treaty rights should be dealt with as it arises. The United States Ambassador has been instructed to make a specific protest against the coufiscatory oil legislation proposed by the Mexican Government. Either before or after this protest, in his discretion, His Majesty&apos;s representative is authorised to seek an informal interview with Senor carranza and to represent to him the undesirable consequences of pursuance of his present policy.3-141-2 u
Ou 10th July Sir C. Spring Rice reported that the United, States Ambassador to&apos; Mexico (now visiting Washington) is ol opinion that a policy of masterly inactivity &quot;is-advisable in Mexico for the present, and until the United States are in a position to take effective steps for re-establishing law and. order. He opposes the idea&apos;&apos;of a-ldan: to Carranza, preferring that the Mexican Government should get money by&apos;taxation, the burden of which would fall on all the Allies and not on the United Stated alone. His plan would be &quot; to keep Carranza guessing,&quot; but he would allow him to impoft&apos;a: certain amount of arms and munitions to repress brigandage. Sir C. Spring Rice considers that in this event Relaez should be similarly provided. &apos;* -   -UNITED STATES. ,Telegraphing through His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington on Gth July,; Lord Northclilfe has drawn, the attention of the Prime Minister, War Cabinet, and&apos; Admiralty to.the fact that in American naval and political circles there is great anxiety with regard to Great Britaitds alleged inactivity in dealing with the submarine danger. Public opinion foresees that if the Germans continue to destroy tonnage at the present rate it will, be impossible for the United States to bring to the front the fighting forces and supplies now in process of preparation. His Lordship enumerates three possible lines of action suggested by American naval officers and others for dealing with the srd.nna.rine, and urges that the British Admiralty should discuss these and other plans promptly with the American authorities.In a subsequent despatch he referred to the deadlock which has occurred in regard to General Goethals&apos; shipbuilding programme, and to an article in the &quot;&quot;Washington Post&quot; of 8th July, in which the causes and consequences of this deadlock are explained. The main fact of the situation appears to be that General Goethals is prepared to conclude contracts for building 2,100,000 tons of steel ships at a cost of $350,000,000, which means that the price of steel going into these ships would be SHI a ton. (The current [nice of steel plates is $95 a ton in the United States and $47 &quot;50 in England.) The Cabinet, Congress, and public opinion are sharply divided over this matter, some maintaining that &quot; lag business &quot; is acting patriotically, others that it is out for profit by unjustifiably raising prices for war material. Whether the contracts are accepted or rejected will, depend upon President Wilsoids decision as to the proper price of steel. &quot; Thus,&quot; says the &quot; Washington. Post,&quot; &quot;even the war with Germany hangs lire while the administration wrestles with the question of prices.&quot; In the absence of a &quot;War Council, the President must act upon his own initiative and judgment, lie is strongly opposed to profiteering, and &quot; rather than see the Government gouged,&quot; will run the war himself, which means running the country&apos;s factories, railroads, and shipping.After a series of calculations (based on figures which appear to be inaccurate arid greatly exaggerated), the &quot; Washington Post &quot; concludes that, at the present rate of sinkings the worlcVs shipping would practically he wiped out within two years and the war thus ended in Germany&apos;s favour. &quot;Therefore,&quot; it declares, &quot; the problem is &quot; up to the United States ; if we do not solve it, the end of two years will see . the &quot; war settle down to a fight between Germany, master of the Old World, and the &quot; United States, master of the New.&quot;Lord Northclilfe proposed (9th July), in company with M. Tardieu and the Russian Ambassador, to seek an audience of the President, and. explain to him the urgent need for fixing the prices of steel, lead, copper, and other materials.The Presidents proclamation prohibiting the export of foodstuffs, fuel, fertilisers, steel, iron and munitions was issued on the 8th of July,&apos;the prohibition coming into effect on the 15th. Sir C. Spring Rice expressed the opinion on the 6th that the prohibition would probably come into effective force within a fortnight. He added that the Exports Embargo Committee, in making their final recommendation to the President, advised that neutral countries contiguous to Germany should be required to stop all exports to that country. Mr. Hoover has been entrusted by the President with general control over relations with neutrals in blockade questions. He believes in drastic measures to prevent supplies reaching Germany, even though they may confront neutral countries with the alternatives of starvation or joining the Allies in war against the Central Powers. In a memorandum which he has drafted for the information of the Scandinavian and Dutch representatives at Washington, it is laid down that the United States will not allow exports to neutral countries until con-yinced by evidence of their minimum food requirements, and that they are making
all possible efforts to increase home production and reduce consumption. The criterion of &quot; normal&quot; imports is to be wholly discarded, and the success of future negotiations for supplies will, depend on the cessation of exports to Germany, and. the maintenance of traffic with the Allies.His Majesty&apos;s Government have instructed Sir C. Spring Rice to invite the attention of the United States Government to the necessity for Allied co-operation to obtain control of Argentine supplies under a scheme of joint purchases and, possibly, of economic and financial pressure. In this connection. Mr. Hoover contemplates inducing the Argentine Government to prohibit the same exports as the United States, but inasmuch as the Argentine is now endeavouring to obtain wheat in North America, it is believed that no supplies of breaclstuffs can be made available from the River-Plate before next February.Sir R. Crawford and Lord Northcliffe discussed the financial position and the needs of the Allies with the Secretary to the Treasury on the 4th of July. Mr. McAcloo emphasised the necessity laid upon him to supply Congress with information as to the manner in. which United States advances to the Allies were being spent, and also as to the military reasons which prompted certain forms of expenditure. He alluded specifically to the case of Italy, who had threatened to &quot;go out of the war &quot; unless her demands were met but who, in his opinion, had failed to put forth her full&apos; strength, lie expressed regret at having been supplied with so little information as to Japan&apos;s reasons for not participating more actively in the war. Lord Northcliffe explained generalL the financial assistance which Great Britain, has given to her Allies and her own consequent need of credits to meet the immense expenditure for Avar purposes (much of it incurred in the United States). To meet current needs the sum of 8185,000,000 was wanted in July and the same in August ; assistance is also required to meet the overdraft of $400,000,000 due &apos; in July. Mr. McAdoo saw no reason for covering the overdraft at once ; he thought the British fiscal agents were attempting to squeeze the Treasury and expressed the opinion that some means, other than advances out of the liberty loan, would have to be found for meeting the obligation. Accordingly two days later, Sir C. Spring-Rice telegraphed asking, on behalf of the Financial Mission, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should express an opinion as to the advisability of covering this overdraft by selling to the United States Government Great Britain&apos;s interests in ships being built in the United States.The question of establishing a censorship over financial correspondence betAveen the United States aud South America is under consideration, as well as emergency measures for occasionally inspecting the mails between America and Spain. At the request of the United States government it has been arranged that an officer of the British Censorship will be sent to act as liaison between British and American Censorships for general and commercial telegrams.THE SHIPPING  SITUATION.The Dutch Navigation Committee recently put forward, certain proposals for an agreement and permanent arrangement in respect of the future use of Dutch shipping in the transatlantic and Anglo-Dutch trades respectively. According to the figures submitted, more than 20 per cent, of Dutch tonnage is at present engaged in trading for Allied interests. After providing the vessels required for trade with North and South America (672,000 tons), Holland declares her remaining tonnage to be insufficient&apos; for the purpose of her East Indian traffic; nevertheless the Dutch Government are prepared to appropriate S0,000 tons for Belgian relief Avork. At the same time the Dutch Government stipulated, as part of the proposed agreement, that &quot; they shall be able to buy and ship in the United States all the supplies they may require, not only as food for man and beast, but for their industries.&quot; In view of the terms and intentions of president Wilson&apos;s proclamation of 8th July (q.v.) these proposals have now become of academic interest. Sir W. ToAvnley has been instructed to point out (9th July) the fallacy underlying their assumption that the present scale of &quot; rations &quot; Avill be allowed to stand ; also that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are not in a position to negotiate a permanent agreement Avith regard to shipping until they know on what basis the Dutch tonnage requirements for overseas trade are estimated, which information has been persistently withheld.The Germans are endeavouring to place orders for ships to be built in Scandinavia from German materials, on the understanding that after the Avar such ships shall be3141--2 E
restricted to traffic between Germany and the country in which they were built. Sir R. Paget suggests that this market might be taken from the Germans if the Allies were to supply Scandinavian shipbuilders with 10,000 to 15,000 tons of materials against long term contracts for delivery after the war.In June the Shipowners&apos; Association at Christiania - drew the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Minister to the delays and losses caused by the application to sailing vessels of the rule which requires ships to call at Halifax when westward, bound. They state that unless sailing ships can be inspected at some port of departure in Scandinavia for the direct voyage,&apos; they must be laid up. The number lying idle at the end of June was between. 40 and 50. Sir W. Findlay now reports that, pending a decision of the question, their number&apos; is increasing, and. he submits that, to prevent this waste of tonnage, steps should be taken to get these vessels into distant waters without further delay.Concerning the proposed transfer of German tonnage to the. Hutch flag (vide last Report), His Majesty&apos;s Government have informed Sir W. Townley of the preliminary conditions under which such transfer would be recognised. These would involve guarantees that the vessels transferred would not be used to carry enemy-owned goods to Holland, as well as a satisfactory settlement of the whole . question of Dutch tonnage, now in process of negotiation.The Swedish Government have supplied Sir E. Howard with a list of the ships, 54 in number, which have left Sweden for Great Britain since 1st February. According to their figures, the June sailings are roughly 25 per cent, of the normal traffic, but they point out that normal sailings are impossible under existing conditions. In view of the recent resumption of trade, they ask for additional calling-facilities, inwards and outwards, for the further encouragement of shipowners.On 6th July Sir E. Howard reported much uneasiuess at Stockholm concerning the fate of the North Sea fishing fleet, numbering some 100 vessels. Four boats had been reported sunk by submarines and the rescued crew of one of them were informed by the Germans that they would sink all they came across in the prohibited zone.The Brazilian Minister in London having expressed anxiety as to the measures to be taken to safeguard the vessels of the &quot; Brazilian Lloyd &quot; when passing through the danger zone, His Majesty&apos;s Government have suggested that, until defensive arrangements have reached a more advanced stage, it wordd be safer that the eleven &quot; Brazilian Lloyd&quot; vessels now arrived, or due to arrive, at Cardiff should not be cleared for Brazil, but that they should be time-chartered or sold to His Majesty&apos;s Government. If the Brazilian Government approve of this proposal, the ships would be given defensive armament and manned by British crews.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.In spite of increasing evidence of their futility, the Dutch Scandinavian Committee at Stockholm pursue their academic discussions of ways and means of establishing peace on earth. On 5th July they held a conference, of a semi-private character, at which were present the delegates from Russia, Hungary, the German Minority, and some members of the German Majority Socialists. The Irish ITades Union Congress and Labour Party having expressed their desire to be heard at Stockholm, the Dutch Scandinavian Committee have now requested the English Labour Party to use their influence to obtain passes for the Irish representatives.On Oth July the views of the German Minority Socialists were published, in the form of a memorandum, at Stockholm. Of definite measures for the conclusion and maintenance of peace, this curious declaration of pacifist-idealist faith contains little or nothing. It demands an &quot; international agreement for universal disarmament, as a means to break militarism,&quot; but offers no practical suggestion as to the means by which agreements are henceforth to be made binding on Germany. It demands the independence of Serbia, and compensation for Belgium ; rejects the policy of Colonial conquest as unnecessary for industrial development, at the same time demanding unrestricted free trade and the abolition of economic war ; a botch potch, in fact, of pious aspirations, couched in the jargon of the &quot; international&apos;&quot; delegate. In their conclusion, however, the German Minority appear to recognise the difficulty of making a Peace Treaty permanently effective ; they declare that mutual trust between the nations, on which peace depends, can only be secured by &quot; the establishment of a &quot; powerful and independent International, supported by the proletariat in its control &quot; over Governments.&quot;
Stockholm has no monopoly of the idea of an &quot;international&quot; millenium. In the discussion which followed the French Chamber&apos;s vote of confidence in the Govern-ment on 8th July, M. Renaudel asked M. Rihot whether the Government Avould soon &quot;take steps to get into touch with President Wilson in order to lay the foundations of a League of Nations, in agreement with the Allies.Certain Russian delegates from the Sovyet Executive Committee to the British Socialist parties (now at Stockholm) are anxious to proceed to London, and have asked for facilities. Sir E. Howard observes that one of their principal objects is to induce their British confreres to adopt the policy of no annexations, particularly with regard to Syria and Mesopotamia.In Anew of the probability that Mr. Ramsay Macdonald. will soon be allowed to leave England for Russia, the Firemen&apos;s and Seamen&apos;s Union desire that he may be accompanied to Petrograd by two of their members, whose business it would be to explain to Russian workmen the real nature of German submarine outrages, and of Mr. Macdonald&apos;s political views. The Foreign Office have asked for Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s observations on this scheme.GENERAL.Lord Newton&apos;s Mission to the Hague concluded its negotiations on 4th July. On the 11th, Plis majesty&apos;s Government signified their definite acceptance of the draft agreement and suggested, that Hull should be the port used for conveying prisoners to and from Holland. The Dutch Government&apos; have been requested to inform the German Government accordingly and to ask for their early reply.The Netherlands Minister at Constantinople (whose unsatisfactory representation of British interests was referred to under this heading in last week&apos;s Report) has now informed his Government that funds for British relief in Turkey are completely exhausted and that, unless means can be found to make regular monthly remittances in advance, the consequences to thousands of penniless and deported civilians will be catastrophic, affecting all British interests in lurkey.Sir W. Townley has been instructed to renew his enquiries through the Dutch authorities concerning the officer-prisoners&apos; camps at Claustel, Schwarmstadt and Siroecken. Also, to ascertain why no parcels haA-e been delivered to British prisoners at Grosstavern since 14th April.
