APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERAL &apos; REPORT,  No.  23.France.The Chamber &quot;is evidently determined to secure a greater direct control over the administration of the ariny, and, where it can, even over operations. The demand for an extension of the British, front corresponding to the relative strength of the British and French, armies is certain to he pressed with increasing insistence, and may have to be firmly resisted in the interests of the maintenance of an effective offensive. \Italy.Baron Sonnino is stronger than ever, though the Cabinet crisis is by no means over. He has contrived, both in Albania and Epirus, to satisfy the Italian sensitive-ness at the thought of France securing any extension of territory or influence for which Italy does not secure an immediate equivalent. Italy must be on an equality with France, at any rate on paper or on the map, whether in the Balkans or in Asia Minor ; no Italian Government can satisfy the Chamber unless it can claim to have fulfilled that condition.Greece.The Italian effort to secure Roumanian officers of Macedonian (i.e., Kutzovlach) extraction, who would presumably be employed to win over the large Kutzovlach population in the mountains east of Janina, coupled with the previously reported attempt to get back Epirot Albanians from America, points to a definite intention on the part of Italy to justify her retention of, at any rate, part of Epirus by strengthening the non-Greek element. Meanwhile the relations between the Italian Government and the new Greek Government are, for the moment, easier.hollan d.The Dutch public is in a very irritated mood at this moment, and the extension of our danger zone in a fashion which still further limits, if it does not wholly shut off, Dutch oversea traffic, has come at an awkward time.Denmark.The Danish producers are evidently restive under our method, or want of method, in dealing with them. The central economic fact of the situation is that they can sell their stuff to Germany, without risk of loss at sea or loss in the market after-wards, at more than three times the price which it can fetch in the British market. We can either pay them a better price, or we can cut off all imports into Denmark and let the Danes export to Germany what they can under those conditions.
Spmv. ! - ; - /The King&apos;s position is still very difficult, but the situation seems to be clearing up. The action of the new Government over the submarine question has considerably annoyed the Germans.China.The revived monarchy will certainly soon be in need of money. The easiest way of getting it is to join tire Allies on good terms. Consequently there is no reason yet to despair of China&apos;s intervention, unless China is plunged in a general civil war.L. S. A.5th July 1917. ,   -

PART I.   BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.The Canadian Government have expressed their regret at the omission from the Imperial War Conference Blue Book of all reference to the discussion upon the cattle embargo. As the matter is one of great importance to the Canadian people, Ministers hope that the matter may be immediately put right. In reply, the Secretary of State for the Colonies points out that the matter Avas considered as settled by the Conference accepting the proposals put forward regarding publication (pages 15-17 of proceedings of 15th day). The list of discussions submitted for publication did not include the cattle discussion, which Avas in fact part of the control of meat supplies debate and unsuitable for publication at the moment. The Secretary of State, however, assures the Dominion Government that the question of separate publication of the discussion will now be considered in consultation Avith the Board of Agriculture. He adds that there is no ground for the suggestion that the omission arose from a desire not to embarrass the British Government.In reply to the invitation of the British Government to nominate a representative to confer Avith the Board of Trade upon the subject of the Empire becoming self-sufficing in meat stipplies,&apos; the Canadian Government have appointed Sir George Perley (Acting High Commissioner and Minister of Overseas Military Forces) as their representative for this purpose..  CANADA.His Majesty the King has conveyed to the Governor-General of Canada a message notifying tbe great satisfaction felt by His Majesty7 and the Queen, that they Avere able to be present at the service in Westminster Abbey in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Confederation of Canada and in honour of the Canadians Avho had fallen in the War.Congratulations to the Dominion of Canada on the 50th anniversary of Con-federation have been conveyed to the Governor-General by the British Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Government of the Australian Commonwealth. Messages have also been sent by His Royal Highness the Duke of Con naught and the Marquis of Lansdowne.The Jubilee celebrations at Ottawa were rendered -notable by the unveiling of a memorial pillar at the new Parliament buildings, the first portions of which have already been completed. The unveiling ceremony was performed by the Governor-General. The Prime Minister delivered an address, in the course of which he said: &quot; It was hardly within, the dream of the men of 50 years ago that Canada should &quot; assume among the nations the. proud position she occupies to-day.&quot; Sir Wilfrid Laurier emphasised this and observed : &quot; The dream of 1807 has been more than &quot; realised in 1917. The wilderness has been conquered, distance has been vanquished &quot; and a nation built and united by the intangible bond of the CroAvn, which is stronger &quot; than any other.&quot;The Second Reading Debate on the Compulsory Service Bill was continued in the Dominion House of Commons on the 27th June and subsequent dates. Amongst the Liberal members supporting the principle of the Bill and speaking against the referendum amendment of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Avere Mr. Frank Carvell (Member for Carleton, N.B.), avIio expressed the view that conscription should not be enforced until the people had been properly educated on the needs of the situation ; and Mr. D. B. Neely (Member for Humboidt, Sask.). Sir Herbert, Ames (Member for St. Antoine Division of Montreal), a prominent supporter of the Conservative Govern-ment, suggested that the Bill should not be enforced until after a General Election.1 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 2nd May and 6th and 12th June 1917.
Other Conservatives, Mr. H. Boulay (Member for Rimouski), and Mr. A. Bellemair (Mem-Ber for Maskinonge, Qne.), and Mr. PI. Achim (Member for Labelle, Que.) expressed them-selves as opposed to the Bill and in favour of consulting the people. Mr. Me cleric Martin (Liberal member for St. Mary&apos;s Division of Montreal), stated that he spoke for the people of Montreal as their Mayor, and that though the Government might pass the Bill, they would not be able to enforce it. He further stated that if the Bill were passed, it would be deliberately provoking the people, and the realm of civil war might be entered. Mr. A. Yerville (Liberal member for Maisonneuve, Qne.), who snoke as a former President of the Trades and Labour Congress, and who is the only member who may be said to represent Labour in the House of Commons, warned the Government that organised Labour would call a general strike if conscription was adopted without the people being first consulted. Mr. Claude MacDonell (Conservative member for South Toronto), stated, however, that the attitude of Labour towards the Avar had been misrepresented by the Trades and Labour Congress officials, and pointed out that Toronto&apos;s working class suburb (Earlscourt) had sent more men to the fighting line in proportion to its population than any other section of Canada. At the beginning of the third week of the Debate on 4th drily, Mr. F. B. MeOurdy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Militia Department) stated that the time was one for action, and that if Canada had followed the example of Great Britain with 17 per cent, of enlistment, the Canadian Expeditionary Force Avould have been provided with 1,224,000 men instead of 421,000.At the Saskatchewan elections for the Provincial Parliament, the Liberals have been returned by a large majority. The Conservatives, avIio held seven seats in the last House, will have tlie same number of members in the neAv Legislature. At this election Avomen voted for the first time, as the Bill granting the provincial franchise to women Avas passed in the last Parliament. Mr. W. M. Martin remains Premier of the Province.An estimate of the Imperial Munitions Board of the Dominion places the financial requirements of the Board for July at $69,000,000. Of this, the Canadian Finance Department haA-e promised $25,000,000, and the British Treasury have been asked to furnish the balance of $44,000,000. Upon this, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has communicated Avith the Dominion GoArernment, and in the course of his telegram he observes that there are only two methods of finding the above-mentioned sum outside of Canada, namely, from the British Treasury account in New York or by the release of gold, ddie United States do not favour the use of funds provided by them except in payment of expenses Avhich are incurred in their oavh country, and the funds which could be thus utilised Avould only cover S 12,000,000 of the sum required. An attempt will be made to provide this amount in New York, though no guarantee can be given as to the exact.dates of payment.Regarding the balance of $32,000,000. the only means of pajunent would be in gold. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, points out that, the British gold resources haAre now been so much reduced that the Avhole amount available must be allocated to payments for urgent requirements in foreign countries. It is therefore impossible to spend the filial reserves in Canada, and it is suggested that the only possible course is for Canada to provide the balance from her own resources. It is pointed out that $10,000,000 of the sum required is for repayment of a loan from the Bank of Montreal, and that the Bank might agree to renew the loan ; and as regards a further $5,000,000 of the sum, which is wanted for interest, it is suggested that this be set off against sterling sums due to the British Government from Canada, or post-poned for the present. There Avouldthus remain a sum of $17,000,000 to be provided for the July finance, and the British Government hope that the Dominion Government may be able to find this sum by means of bank loans or hy additional currency notes. Though the reluctance of the Canadian Finance Minister to increase his note issue, Avithout gold or Bank of England Notes behind it, is fully appreciated by the Home Government, it is pointed out that a stage of the Avar has been reached where it is necessary to take risks, and the Dominion Government are urged to consider the great loss Avhich would be incurred hy Canadian manufacturers, apart from the effect on the supply of munitions, if the Imperial Munitions Board were unable to meet its liabilities. The Chancellor of the Exchequer adds that the considerations which he has pointed out as applicable to the finance of munitions also apply to funds required to finance the purchase of cheese and other commodities through the Dominion Government Departments.
The Dominion Government state that they have no objection to Serbians resident in Canada being called hp . for service with the Serbian Army. Pending the availability of transports, it is suggested that they could be accommodated at Levis Ganrp, which has been used for some time past as a concentration camp for Serbian volunteers.In reply to the enquiry of the Prime&apos; Minister as to whether Cardinal Mercier or some other Belgian prelate could visit Qjuebec, the Secretary of State has informed the Dominion Government that it would be impossible for Cardinal Mercier to leave Belgium, but that he is consulting Cardinal Bourne regarding another prelate.An Order in Council was passed on 16th June that no application for transfer of registry of a British ship from the port of registry in the Dominion to a port outside should be made or granted without the consent of the Minister of Marine.1The Admiralty have approved the scheme for building composite ships, and have offered to supply boiler tubes from the United Kingdom if they are wanted.The Dominion Ministers have been assured that they will of course be consulted before any of the vessels of the Canadian Pacific Ocean Service, trading between British Columbia and the Far East, are requisitioned.2 They have also been informed that the British Government do not propose to interfere with these vessels at present.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.In reply to the enquiry as to the enlistment of. American citizens in the Australian forces, the Government of the United States have intimated that they have no objection to this course if those who propose to enlist in this way are not registered for service in the United States Army.The New South Wales Cabinet have decided to supplement the Federal War Pensions for soldiers who are totally incapacitated by KB. per week, making a total pension of 21. Upon this Senator Milieu (Vice-President of the Executive Council in the Federal Ministry) has expressed his surprise, stating that at the recent Conference, Avhich was attended by a representative of New South Wales, it was unanimously resolved that the question of. the re-establishment of discharged soldiers and sailors and the care of their dependants should be a Commonwealth matter.The Army Council have informed the Commonwealth Government that in order to maintain the mounted forces in Mesopotamia -during the cold season of 1918-19, it is essential to import to India 17,000 horses during the coming winter, so that they may acclimatise and be in readiness for operations in the following year. - The resources of India in this regard have been entirely exhausted, and Australia and New Zealand provide the only available sources of supply, on account of the necessity of employing the shortest and safest route. It is added, that it would be impossible for the United Kingdom to furnish the necessary shipping for the transport of the horses, and the Commonwealth are asked to provide the tonnage that will be required.The Australian Government have asked that the United States may be informed that from August to December next the exportable surplus of Australian butter will amount to 20,000 tons, and the Commonwealth would put the whole of this quantity at the disposal ot the United States, under conditions which would ensure supplies in accordance with the requirements of the American Food Law. In the event of the United States entertaining the proposal, the Commonwealth Government would be prepared to send experts to America to see that any contracts are properly carried out.NEW ZEALAND.The Secretary of State has informed the Governor-General that His Majesty the King has been pleased to mark the change of status from Governor to that of Governor-General of New Zealand by making the holder of that office a member of1 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 30th. May and 6th, 12th and 20th June 1917 2 See Western and General Report for week ending 20th. June 1917. 3441-1 B
the Privy Council.   Lord Liverpool has conveyed his deep appreciation of the honour conferred upon him.With regard to the reported requisitioning of the &quot; Oorinthic,&quot; the.Dominion Government have pointed out the strong feeling which exists in New Zealand that, owing to the great amount of produce which is &apos; being left in store, trade, is being . brought to a standstill. Suggestions are reaching the Dominion Ministers that on. account of the withdrawal of steamers, further reinforcements should not be permitted, to leave New Zealand.SOUTH AFRICA.The Union. Ministers have had under consideration for some, time the question of admitting a certain number of Japanese into South Africa, and they have agreed to , admit on temporary permits not more than 30 persons of that nationality per annum, who are students, Government officials, or those engaged in commerce. The necessary permits will be available for periods not exceeding three years and will be issued, in accordance with the passports or other documents provided by the Government of Japan. Further, the Union Ministers are willing to issue licences to Japanese subjects to enable them to act as agents for foreign lirms and to book orders for goods to be supplied from Japan. Persons to whom these licences are issued will be included in the number to whom the right of entry into the Union will be extended.In reply to the suggestion made by the Union Government as to the local control over the allotment of cargo space in homeward-bound vessels,1 the Shipping Controller fears that the appointment of a local Controller would not be satisfactory, as it would involve dual control. He appreciates that the Union Government should be placed in close touch with existing machinery, so that no question of preference for particular private interests should arise, and has therefore decided to appoint a Committee of Agents at Cape Town. The Government of the Union are asked to nominate a representative on this Committee. It is further intimated that, if occasion requires, sub-committees of agents will be appointed at other ports.In reply to an enquiry made by the German Foreign Office, the Union Government state that last February most of the male enemy subjects (including some a\ ho were over the age of 45 years) who resided within 100 miles of the coastline, were either interned or forced to reside further inland. It is added that no women or children are interned in the Union.As there are strong reasons for removing all Germans from German East Africa, and the matter of shipping makes it difficult to transfer them to places outside the Continent, the Union Government have been asked if they can arrange to receive them at internment camps in South Africa.The Union Ministers point out that recruiting for the Native Labour Contingent is not progressing satisfactorily (2nd July). Various reasons are assigned for this, including the matter of payment of allotments.by telegram of the same date, the Army Council have conve)red to the South African Government their regret that they cannot agree to the suggested payment of allotments to the natives. The Union Alinisters are reminded that the non-payment of separation allowances and lower pensions and gratuities for death and disablement were matters which were taken into consideration when the rates of pay for the Contingent were fixed.The Union Ministers express their regret that the necessity of maintaining the units already in the field, and the disappointing recruiting returns, have compelled them to abandon temporarily the recruiting of motor cyclists for General Northey&apos;s force. The number recruited up to the present is 63, of which 37 have been sent forward and 26 are under training.   There still remain 437 to be recruited.In reply to the enquiry made3, the Union Ministers state that they do not wish that the necessary visa should be granted to the Mormon missionaries who desire to go to South Africa.1 See Western arid General Report for week ending 6th June 1917.&quot; See Western and General Report for week ending 20th June 19.17.3 See Western and General Report for week ending 20th June 1917, under &quot; General.&quot;
RHODESIA.The Southern Rhodesian Administration have telegraphed their appreciation o  the difficulty of employing the Second Rhodesian Regiment as an Imperial unit.1 and they have agreed to the suggestion of the Army Council to use the regiment to reinforce the South African Brigade now serving in France. Satisfaction is expressed that the units will be allowed to retain the identity of the regiment.SIERRA LEONE., The Secretary of State has conveyed his appreciation to the Government of the Colony for the readiness shown in releasing members of the Civil Staff. The Governor is, however, further urged to cut down the European staff of Civil Departments to the minimum, as every officer who can be utilised for service with the West Africa Frontier Force, or Carrier Corps, will afford the War Office relief.LIBERIA.The Liberian Government informed all German subjects on the 29th June that they must be ready to leave the country at short notice for internment in France.EAST AFRICA   PROTECTORATE.The Governor has pointed out that the shortage of shipping will have a serious effect upon local industries, such as flax, coffee and sisal, and unless there is a reasonable prospect of shipping being available, the local banks are unwilling to ,make advances. The Legislative Council at a recent Session, agreed that the local Government should make advances at the rate of 25Z. per ton against coffee actually stored with the Government. The amount required for one year would be 50,0001., and approval of this course is sought. Regarding other export industries, it is improbable that, the Brotectorate could finance them, and the Governor asks if there is any likelihood of assistance from the Imperial Government.GERMAN EAST AFRICA.With regard to the hope expressed by the British Government that the Belgian Government would allow carriers to be recruited from the Congo in order to meet the necessities of. the Belgian troops operating in German East Africa2, the Governor-General of the Congo has been instructed to recruit 10,000 carriers from the Belgian Congo. Every effort will be made to ensure their arrival in East Africa at the earliest possible moment.PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.The British Consul at Lorenzo Marques reports that the Governor-General, in reply to a telegram from General Van Deventer, has stated his inability, after See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 9th May and 20th Jane 1917. - See Western and General Report for week ending 27th June 1917.
consultation with Lisbon, to give facilities for recruiting carriers in Portuguese East Africa.   The Consul adds that the decision appears to be final.1JAMAICA.With reference to recruits from Panama,2 it is reported that 1,400 recruits have been sent to Jamaica, and groups of 1,600 more will follow. The Governor of Jamaica has been informed that no suitable place is available in the Canal zone for a training camp.HONG  KONG.The British Government have intimated their wish to use the resources of the colony for budding wooden or composite ships.&apos;1 The particulars of the types required have been telegraphed to the Governor with a suggestion that a strong local board of experts should be appointed who would he responsible for the supplies of material and labour.part ii-foreign affairs.ALLIED COMMON AFFAIBS.Baron. Sonnino has informed the Drench Ambassador at Rome that he fully expects to be able to attend the Conference in Paris on 16th July.The Belgian Government, through their Minister in London, have requested that Belgium may be represented, and take part, in the forthcoming Conference of the Allies. Noting the Russian Governments intention (as expressed in their official Note handed to M. Albert Thomas on 13th June) to oppose all Imperialistic tendencies and annexatiouist ideas, the Belgian Government feel convinced that the impending Conference must have a very decided effect on the duration of the war and the terms of peace, and as the existence of Belgium is at stake, they desire to have a voice in the discussion of these questions. In particular they consider that Belgium, having played no inconsiderable part in the conquest of German East Africa, has a right to be consulted in the matter of the disposal of Germany&apos;s colonies.His Majesty?s: Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has requested the United States Ambassador, to draw the attention of President Wilson unofficially to the importance of American representation on Allied Conferences. By virtue of the preponderant part which the United States is playing in matters of production and finance, and of the increasing importance of her military activities, President Wilson must be deeply interested, not only in the conduct of the war, but in the rearrangements that will follow it; as matters stand, however, there are obvious difficulties in the way of1 (See &quot;Western, and General Reports for weeks ending 30th May and 6tb, 12th and 27th June 1917. 2 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 20th and 27th June 1917. -3 A similar telegram has been sent to the Straits Settlements.
regular and satisfactory American representation. The distance factor presents a serious obstacle, as it does in the case of Russia ; the absence in the American system of anyone equivalent to the British, French, or Italian Prime Minister is another difficulty ; for a head of a Department, even if he could be spared, would represent the Presidents views imperfectly at best. Mr. Page undertook to write confidentially to Mr.-Wilson on the subject.His Majesty7&apos;s Government, have expressed their gratification at the Italian Governments decision to participate in the silk-purchasing scheme, and at the&apos; immediate application of the decree prohibiting the export of thrown silk. As regards the location of the head purchasing Bureau, His Majesty&apos;s Government are now disposed to waive their objection to Milan, provided the execution of old contracts is limited to a total of 1.20 tons. An intimation in this sense was conveyed to Lord Bertie on 28th June.       -FRANCE.From a high official quarter Lord Bertie learns that the Prench Government regard M. Caillaux and his pacifist-financier following as completely7 discredited, and that, in spite of his restless activities and ambitions, there is little or no prospect of his returning to power. The feeling against him is so strong, especially in the Army, that if he showed himself in the streets without police protection his life would not he safe.   His efforts to found a Republican League have not been successful.Lord Bertie reported on 29th June that the secret session of the Chamber which began on that day, would discuss the question of appointing &quot; Commissaires dux armees,&quot; under a system similar to that enforced during the Convention. It appears that a majority of Deputies are in favour of the adoption of such a system, but General. Betain is definitely opposed to it and inclined even to restrict the facilities at present granted for visiting the Army zone. The Government proposed as a compromise to appoint a number of Under Secretaries, who, as members of the Government, would be attached to the armies in the field, an arrangement which General Betain was prepared to accept. During the recent sitting on 3rd july the Minister of War emphasised-sised the necessity for control by Parliament over the Army- in all matters not directly concerning the higher command&apos;s plans for the conduct of operations. A Bill will be brought in to provide for cpurt-martialling incompetent military commanders under a system similar to that already  applied to the Navy. The Minister was attacked from the Left in connection with a circular recently issued by General Foch containing instructions to officers with regard to the suppression of disorders ; he succeeded in disarming opposition by reminding the Left of his own -career and his own incorruptible Republicanism.M. Abel Ferry, Deputy7, formerly Under Secretary of State at the Quai d&apos;Orsay and reporter of the Chamber Commission of the Army, called on His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador on 3rd July to explain the attitude which he had adopted in attacking the Ministry during the secret session of the Chamber. He had pressed the Govern-ment to insist on an extension of the British front, because (being himself a cordial supporter of the Entente and aware of the feelings of the French Army) he was convinced that the French Governments hesitation to speak frankly on the subject is a great mistake that may lead to disaster. The French Army feel that they have borne an unfair share of the common burden ; the result is discontent and even suggestions for peace. To put an end to these feelings, he and others consider it necessary to extend the British front by 85 miles so as to enable the French troops to have their fair turn of rest during the coming winter. The density of British troops on the ground is two or three times greater than the Prench. M. Ferry&apos;s report has been adopted by the Commission of the Army in the Chamber and he believes the Government will accept his proposals. The position of the president of the Republic is not in question.BELGIUM.Sir W. Townley reports, on the authority of a Dutch official resident in Brussels, that 23 Belgians of good position were deported by the German authorities on 29th3441-1 0
June find taken to the internment camp at Holzminclen, where the treatment of prisoners is known to be particularly bad. Amongst them are the Count d&apos;.Oultre-mont, formerly a Chamberlain of the Court, and Count dJJrsel. The Germans declare that they have deported these people as a reprisal for the ill-treatment of German prisoners conveyed to France, via the Belgian Congo, from German East Africa. All of the victims are connected in some Avay or other with the Belgian ,Conno; several of them are in bad health and of advanced age.ITALY.Baron Sonnino has explained to the Russian Ambassador in Rome that the Albanian proclamation was a military measure of a military character and intended as a reply to the Austrian proclamation of autonomy under Austrian suzerainty ; the term &quot;protection&quot; was only intended to mean that Italy guarantees Albanian independence (with a reserve as regards Yalona) and that no other Bower should establish a lien on the country. Sir R. Rodd is convinced that Baron Sonnino realises that the proclamation should not have Been issue1! without consulting the Allies, and. that his explanations are directed towards extenuating this error. At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador believes that the Foreign Ministers action in this matter was precipitated by the decisions taken by England and France with regard to Greece, and that the proclamation of Albanian independence averted a very difficult situation, by reassuring those who saw danger in allowing France too free a hand in the Balkans.All fears of a Ministerial crisis were dissipated by the ChambeFs vote of confidence in the Government, passed by a majority of nearly 300, on 30th June. Sir R. Rodd considers that this result was greatly due to the influence and eloquence of Baron Sonnino. Two days before, the situation had seemed so threatening that His Majesty the King had been compelled to abandon his intention of leaving Rome for the front on 2nd July, at which date the Duke of Connaught had arranged to meet him there. In the event of His Majesty being unable to leave Rome, His Royal Highness will be received by the Duke of Aosta.GREECE.At the request of the Foreign Office, the French Government have communicated to Lord Bertie the text of the Note and accompanying Memorandum addressed to M. Zaimis by M. Jonnart, demanding the abdication of the late King of Greece, on 10th June.   By the terms of the Note it was laid down that King Constantine &quot; would himself designate a successor from &quot;amongst his heirs, in agreement with the Protecting Powers.&quot;   At the same time M. Zaimis was notified that the Crown Prince was not eligible for the Throne &quot; as he does not offer the guarantees which France, &quot; Great Britain and Russia are now obliged to demand, from the Constitutional 11 sovereign of the Greeks,&quot; and that they could only agree to designate another of the King&apos;s heirs.   In reference to this point, Lord Bertie adds that M. Jonnart verbally informed M. Zaimis that M. Venizelos had expressed acceptance of Prince Alexander, on the ground that the accession of Prince Paid would have involved a Regeiuw and further complications.M. Venizelos arrived in Athens and took the oath at the Palace on the inorning of the 27 th ; on the same day two regiments of the National Army arrived from Salonika. In the evening he addressed an enthusiastic crowd from the balcony of his hotel ; in the course of his speech he announced the intention of his Government to insist (1) on the purely democratic character of the monarchy in Greece; (2) on the removal of certain judges and magistrates who had proved themselves unfitted for their posts ; and (3) on the moral and material reorganisation of the army. As regards (1), Mr. Crackanthorpe understands that the Prime Minister proposes, after the election of the Constituent Assembly, to have the abdication of King Constantine and the Crown Prince formally recognised, and King Alexander^ lawful succession ratified.
He will also ask the Chamber to vote a credit for the amount of the pension provided for King Constantine under the terms of abdication (500,000 francs per annum), in regard to which the Protecting Powers are not committed by any guarantee.Following upon the departure of the Provisional Government, the British and French. Missions to Salonika were recalled. Lord Granville is returning to England on leave.On 29th June the Greek representatives at Berlin, Vienna and Constantinople were notified, through the Greek Minister at Berne, of their recall to Athens, coincident with the rupture of diplomatic relations and the consequent existence of a state of war between Greece and the Central Empires. It is intended to convoke the Chamber of May 19.15 as soon as possible, with a view to the proclamation of martial law. On 30th June M. Venizelos, as Minister of War, received the principal military officers from Morea ; on the same day the oath of allegiance to King Alexander was taken by all the troops in Old and New Greece. Mr. Crackanthorpe expects that the classes of 1910 and 1917 will, shortly be called up for training; in this connection he observes, however, that id. Venizelos would hail with satisfaction the departure of such &quot; Missions de Mefiance &quot; as that of General Cauboue, whose raison d&apos;etre has now lapsed. The new Chief of Staff will be either General Haralambis, late Minister of War, or General Negroponti. M. Venizelos confidently expects to have 10 divisions mobilised in three months and 15 in six months. The old army and the new are to be amalgamated, and the troops in Morea to return to their original bases.M. Jonnart proposes to leave for France shortly, to present his report fo the French and British Governments, returning&quot; thereafter to Greece should his presence there be required. His work of conciliation and reorganisation has proceeded with remarkable rapidity ; its success is emphasised by the fact that M. Venizelos has expressed, the hope that he may not relinquish the post of High Commissioner at present. On 28th June the French troops were withdrawn from Athens to positions outside the town and the Russian contingent sent back to Salonika.With regard to the Allied Controls, the High Commissioner proposes to call a meeting of the Allied representatives to discuss the question of their abolition or maintenance. The military control, in his opinion, no longer serves any useful purpose. As to the others, while some (e.g , posts and telegraphs) are still of great importance, he thinks that they should be so modified in application as not to hurt Greek susceptibilities. He suggests admitting Greek representation to their Boards, so as to minimise the idea of foreign control. Mr. Crackanthorpe, after discussing the subject with M. Venizelos, fully concurs in the desirability of eliminating foreign intervention in Greek affairs as speedily as possible ; meanwhile he thinks it possible, by timely compromises, to reconcile Greek amour propre with the maintenance of necessary safeguards until the authority of M. Venizelos is completely established.The French Ambassador at Rome received instructions from his Government on 28th June to come to an understanding with the Italian Government as to the limits of territory occupied respectively by the Italian and French forces in. Epirus.. On the 27th M. Venizelos discussed the question of the occupation of Janina with, the Italian Minister at Athens ; in view of the changes that have taken place in the political situation, he proposed that the Greek authorities should be reinstated without delajr. He pointed out that it must be difficult for him to persuade his countrymen to make common cause with the Allies, as he proposed to do, so long as any portion of Greek territory remains in Italian occupation. The Italian Minister was sympathetic and undertook to advise his Government accordingly. On 3rd. July Sir P. Rodd reported that the Italian Minister had received the necessary instructions and had established friendly relations with M. Venizelos, with whom he proposed, to deal direct. The Minister for Foreign Affairs anticipated, no difficulty in coming to an understanding regarding Epirus.Official information received from Roumania goes to show that the Italian Minister at Jassy recently requested the Roumanian Government to send a number of Roumanian officers of Macedonian (i.e., Kutzovlaoh) extraction to Greece, for the furtherance of Italian policy in that country, and that the Roumanian Government had complied, to the extent of undertaking to send about a hundred officers and civilians for this purpose. To the French Ministers remonstrances, the Prime Minister replied that the Roumanian Government Avere pledged and could not noAv AvithdraAV from their promise. Subsequently (30th June), by order of the King, the military officers in question were forbidden to leave for Macedonia.   As for the
civilian emissaries, His majesty&apos;s Government have suggested to the French Government that steps should be taken, if necessary, to prevent them from reaching Macedonia.Estimating the requirements of Greece in the matter of imported food supplies and tonnage, the Allied Board at Athens report that all Greek steamers not time-chartered to the Allies will be required to provision Greece with essential commodities other than grain. The actual amount of wheat imports required is 218,000 tons, the transport of which will have to be supplied by steamers at present under time charter to the Allies. Beyond the cargoes of grain now loading in the United States, no more shipments from America to Greece will be authorised : all future requirements will be met from India or Australia.GERMAN AFFAIRS.Information received through Copenhagen points to the fact that the German Government are becoming seriously concerned, at the steady decrease in the purchasing power of the mark, and compelled thereby to reduce their purchases in neu ral countries. Efforts have been made, without success, to induce Danish bankers to give the Reichsbank further credits ; the trade balance against Germany will therefore have to be met with remittances in gold. Under these conditions cattle and food purchases from Scandinavia are likely to be reduced.From a reliable source at The Hague it is reported that Germany has requested Austria in a somewhat peremptory manner to transfer her gold reserves to Berlin, on the ground that greater stability of exchange will thus be secured for both countries. Austria&apos;s reply was not known.A certain Dr. Jaffe, working in connection wdth the German Uanclelstelleplan Bress Bureau, and with the German Legation at The Hague, is reported to be charged with a mission of propaganda, with a view to the union of Holland and Belgium and to their joint entry into the German Federation. The idea has been discussed with, several peace organisations and wdth members of the Dutch Chamber, but without evoking any enthusiasm. Sir W. Townley regards this mission as a ballon d&apos;essdi, preparatory to the establishment of a new propaganda Bureau at The Hague.According to information supplied by Herr N., a German banker, and transmitted by His majesty&apos;s Minister in a neutral capital, the general condition of the people in Germany has improved since the spring, the food supply having Been reinforced by the arrival of wheat from Roumania, In regard to the military situation, he said, that although Hindenburg&apos;s prestige lias declined, there is no prospect of a revolution in Germany. The General Staff are very anxious to bring the war to an end this autumn, dreading the prospect of having to face fresh American troops in the spring. As for the U boats, their losses have been considerably greater than the German naval authorities expected ; they are straining every nerve to increase the output of submarines and hope to be able to launch them at the rate of 15 a month. On the Russian front the German troops had been forbidden to &quot; fraternise,&quot; as it was feared that the Russians&apos; revolutionary ideas might prove infectious.AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS. The harvest in Austria is reported to be exceptionally bad.The recent visit of the Austrian Emperor and Empress to Munich was officially stated to be in return for the King of Bavaria&apos;s visits to Vienna, but its object is generally admitted, to be political (their Majesties being accompanied by Count Czernm and other dignitaries), and connected with subjects lately discussed between Czernin, Herding and the Chancellor at Berlin.In the &quot; Vossische. Zeitung&quot; it was recently announced that Herr Helfferich, Baron Rodern and Dr. Zimmermann were going to Vienna to discuss with the Austrian Government the terms and conditions of the future Zollverein between the Central Bowers.

HOLLAND.On 29th June the &quot; Nieuwe Rotterdam Courant&quot; published a statement to the effect that public opinion in Holland exonerated Great Britain from all blame for the country&apos;s shortage of potatoes. Sir W. Townley shows that this statement is incorrect by quoting the following information supplied from Rotterdam to the &quot; Kolnische Zeitung&quot; of the same date: &quot;Twelve thousand tons of potatoes are &quot; being shipped from here to England, although the Dutch people have to do without &quot; them. Riots and assaults are therefore taking place on the lighters from which the &quot; ships are being loaded.&quot; On the previous day a British vessel was actually attacked in the iDort of Rotterdam by a crowd of women, who carried off some 40 bags of potatoes, the police rendering but half-hearted assistance. On the 29th,&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Minister reported that new potatoes were being exported to Germany, in consequence of which he was instructed to call the immediate attention of the Dutch Government to the fact that, until the stipulated quantities have been offered to Great Britain, such action constitutes a flagrant breach of agreement entailing serious consequences. Sir W. Townley discussed the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 3rd July. His Excellency endeavoured to justify the export of new potatoes to Germany on the ground that an offer had been made to deliver to Great Britain the quantity of old ones short-supplied and due under the agreement. His Majesty&apos;s Minister was able to show that, even, if this argument were admitted, the offer was not genuine and had not been fulfilled. Telegraphing on 3rd July, Sir W. Townley observed that the measure had. created widespread anger in Holland. Mr. van Aalst had called to announce his intention of resigning the Chairmanship of the Overseas Trust ; as an institution, the Trust could be nothing but an object of derision now that, the seas are closed to Dutch shipping. The Dutch Press is full of angry articles, and public opinion is evidently hostile. Sir W. Townley observes that, not having received, any information on the subject, he is unable to afford, explanations; he suggests some modification of the Admiralty order unless it is imperatively necessary for military reasons.Serious riots occurred at Amsterdam on the nights of the 2nd and 3rd July. On the 2nd the crowd looted a quantity of new potatoes awaiting shipment to England ; the police, aided by troops, were eventually compelled to fire on the mob.On 28th June, the Committee representing the combined interests of the Dutch Trawler Owners and Herring Dealers&apos; Associations requested to be allowed to send a deputation to London to discuss the herring and trawler agreements, desiring to remove in advance any question of bad faith on their part should circumstances hereafter render it impossible for them to fulfil the terms of the trawler agreement. His Majesty&apos;s Government decided to receive the deputation.Referring to the impending extension of the British Admiralty&apos;s proclaimed danger zone, as reported by the Netherlands Minister in London, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has pointed out as a matter of great urgency, that, if correctly stated, this extension of the mined area will practically mean that Dutch shipping will have no access to anv safe channel for overseas trade. ________  .SWEDEN.On 30th June Mr. Branting telegraphed, to his newspaper, the &quot;Social. Demokraten,&quot; from Christiania (where lie was attending the Scandinavian Inter-parliamentary Conference), giving a description of the German infernal machines and comparing the activities of Baron Rautenfels with the earlier efforts of Baron von Rosen. With &quot; indignation and uneasiness&quot; he asks whether the hands of the Swedish Foreign Office are clean in all this shady business ? What are the unseen forces which in Sweden have hindered enquiries into these crimes ? In thus writing, Mr. Branting was no doubt aware that the Norwegian Government had lately proposed to Sweden and Denmark joint action against espionage in general and particularly against the spies wdio, having been expelled from one country, continue their activities in another. On 3rd July the Swedish Foreign Office issued a communique to the Press justifying their attitude and actions in regard to -the Rautenfels case, the von Rosen affair and other German espionage activities, and deploring the insinuations of M. Branting.3441-1 &apos;   ; . i.)
Sir E. Howard reports that the unexpected resignation of Heir von Sydow, Minister of the Interior, on 30th June, is generally ascribed to his unwillingness to countenance the inactivity of the Swedish police against German bomb agents and spies. The remonstrances of the Liberal and Socialist Press on this&apos;subject appear to have been useful, for several German agents have lately become expellecLand a close watch established over the bomb-distributing centre in Stockholm. On 29th June eight large cases bearing the seals of the Reichsbank were opened on suspicion by the Swedish Customs ; they were found to contain not bombs but securities to a large amount, sold to the Sveriges Hypoteksbank.Recent despatches from Sir E. Howard point to the fact that Germany is neglecting no opportunity to retain and consolidate her position, and that she has still powerful friends at the Swedish capital. On 27th June he pointed out that the recent appointment of M. Vredenburch to be Minister for Holland at Stockholm is unfortunate, as he is extremely pro-German. On the 28th he reported that two days before, His Majesty the King, in conversation with the French Minister, had hinted that the encpriri.es being conducted on the subject of explosives might lead to seriously unpleasant results, evidently alluding to certain insinuations of the Germanophil Press that bombs had been placed on a British vessel by one of the Allied Legations to arouse enmity against Germany. On the 29th Sir E. Howard informed, the Foreign Office confidentially that he considered it inadvisable to submit all statutory list evidence to the American Legation (as reqtiested) for purposes of co-operation, for the reason that the United States Consul-General at Stockholm is very pro-German, having been 17 years Consul in Germany. On the same day he cited evidence of an unfriendly attitude on the part of the Swedish Foreign Office in issuing for publication, without reference or previous notice, unconfirmed statements damaging to Great Bri tain.On the urgent representations of the Swedish Minister in London, and on account of: the reported deterioration of cargoes, His Majesty&apos;s Government have authorised the immediate release from Halifax of three more grain ships, carrying 20,000 tons of cereals.NORWAY.The Norwegian Legation in Berlin has been instructed to bring the facts of the Rautenfels case to the knowledge of the German Government and. to enter a definite protest on. behalf of the Norwegian Government against this serious abuse of couriers&apos; privileges and against the violation of Norwegian territory. The Norwegian Government assume that the courier, who has been sent back to Germany, will there be prosecuted criminally for his offences in Norway.The new German Minister, von Hintze, arrived in Christiania on 29th June. His appointment had been arranged before the discovery of the bomb plot; Sir M Findlay thinks it probable that he was selected as a representative more suitable than his predecessor for the direction of such enterprises. The facts of his record as a notorious intriguer, as established at Peking and Petrograd, have been confidentially communicated to the Norwegian Government, leaving them to draw their own conclusions.The S.S. &quot; Thorunn &quot; case is still unsettled, Prince Henry not having confirmed the sentence of fine imposed on her master and mate. The Norwegian Minister in Berlin reports that the Germans will insist acceptance of the three-mile limit for territorial waters. The Norwegian Government were prepared to alter the law in this matter and until, tire end of the war to agree to the three-mile limit, but they decline to do so under pressure.DENMARK.On 28th June Sir R. Paget was directed to inform the Danish Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government confidently expect that they will resist G-ermany&apos;s demand for an increased export of cattle and horses. His Majesty&apos;s Minister, telegraphing on the same day, observed that exporters are confronted by a position even more difficult than before the first demand for such increase was made, because
Germany now proposes to insist on a guarantee that German salt (live times cheaper than the British article) shall not he used for curing bacon or butter for Great Britain. In the opinion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it will be necessary to bargain with them.Much dissatisfaction has been expressed by the Executive of the Agricultural Associations in Denmark at the failure of the recent negotiations in London in regard to British trade in Danish produce. At a meeting, at which the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs were present, the delegates described the course of these negotiations. As a result, it was decided to form a Central Agricultural Controlling Committee, which would deal with the question of shipments to Great Britain on commercial lines and independently of the Government. Mr. Andersen believes that this Committee will insist on a price being guaranteed for produce before shipment, farmers being unwilling to continue dealing under the present unsatisfactory conditions. If British importers refuse to quote a satisfactory price, the goods will be sold in loco ; in that case, producers will certainly not be bound by any definite arrangement limiting the volume of exports to Germany. &apos;With reference to the resolutions adopted by this meeting, Mr. Andersen has expressed the hope to Plis Majesty&apos;s Minister that the British Government may devise some means of attracting Danish produce without expecting farmers to sell at a loss, by which presumably is meant a loss of the profit they might make from Germany. The new Committee will not be formed for about a week; meanwhile, butter shipments will continue, but no bacon will go forward until some arrangement is reached. On 30th June, Sir R. Paget was directed to inform the Agricultural Association that His Majesty&apos;s Government have appointed a Commissioner to watch the handling and transport of Danish bacon. According to the Association, however, the difficulty is essentially one of market, Sweden offering 2-k times more than the English price, and Germany 3-1- times. They assert that the Danish pig breeders cannot continue to send the greater part of their produce to a market &quot; whose lack of &quot; interest in their goods is proved by the want of care displayed, in maintaining their &quot; superior quality, as well as by the low prices reluctantly offered.&quot;The Danish shipowners have accepted the arrangement as negotiated (vide last Report). Their representative at Copenhagen has expressed the hope that having thus obtained the disposal of all Danish tonnage not actually trading to Denmark, His Majesty&apos;s Government will not &quot;induce the United States to cut off all exports to Denmark.&quot;SPAIN.In a recent despatch (10th June) Sir A. Hardinge supplies further information respecting the military &quot;Juntas.&quot; Their numbers and influence have rapidly increased since.their successful trial of strength with the Government, but the great majority of the officers disavow all connection with the revolutionary movement. Their activities are clearly inspired by professional and not by political motives. Nevertheless, there exists among them an undeniable feeling of resentment against the &quot; Court party &quot; of the King&apos;s entourage. Telegraphing on 3rd July, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador reported that a Decree was about to be signed instituting the appoint-ment by rote of officers of all arms to the King&apos;s Military Household, a measure which will make it possible to eliminate unpopular individuals in his entourage without loss of dignity. At the same time the rank and file have been propitiated by an increase of pay.The &quot;Imparcial,&quot; of 1.0th June, published the text of five resolutions which had been circulated to all artillery &quot; juntas &quot; for signature. Sir A. Hardinge observes that adherence to the &quot; juntas&apos;&quot; programme of reforms and desiderata is becoming universal throughout the army. The Infant Don Fernando is said to have signed an engagement to support them ; the story goes that when he consulted the King in the matter, His Majesty advised him to sign, and added : &quot;If I had the chance, I would sign the damned thing myself.&quot;Despite the protests and warnings of the Allied Powers, in which the Italian Government joined, the Spanish authorities released the German submarine U.C. 52, after the completion of her repairs at Cadiz, on 29th June. Idle Spanish Governments official Note on the subject maintained their obligation to release the vessel under the terms of the Plague Convention ; they added, unofficially, that, according to Dutch precedent, even a&apos; general exclusion of submarines from neutral ports would not
prevent these vessels from seeking refuge for repairs. On the 30th, a decree was published closing ail Spanish ports and waters to submarines on pain of internment; this was prefaced by a letter from the Prime Minister to the King explaining that the Hague rules have become too general. Recognising the many difficulties with which the Spanish Government are confronted in maintaining their neutrality, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided (28th June), without prejudice to broader issues, not to press the protest lodged in resjDect of the U.C. 52. The decree closings Spanish ports to submarines has greatly annoyed the German Ambassador. Sir A. Hardinge reports that he made public display of his chagrin at the race course on 1st July.On 13th June the Press of Madrid published the inaugural statements made by the new Prime Minister, Senor have , and by the new Minister of War respectively. Senor Datd explained his assumption of office on the ground that there was no one else to form a Cabinet and because Count Romanones and his friends of the Liberal party had declared that a continuance of the Liberal Government would be impolitic. He had taken office from an honourable sense of duty; he intended to follow a national, and not a party, policy, hoping thus to secure the sympathy and support of public opinion. He did not intend to dissolve the Cortes as he did not wish to be deprived of the support of Parliament in case of need. As to the military question, he was convinced that the army had no political motives for its recent action; and with regard to foreign affairs he intended to pursue the policy of the Marques of Lema, and maintain the neutrality of Spain. The Government would never depart from, it of their own free will.His Majesty&apos;s Ambussador reports that labour strikes of a somewhat serious nature ,have occurred at Cartagena, but the Government appear to have the situation in hand.CHINA.On 30th June Mr. Alston, reporting on the possibility of a settlement of China&apos;s internal difficulties, observed that the new Premier, Li Ching-hsi, was experiencing great difficulty in forming a Cabinet. Doubtless most of the suitable candidates for the post were already aware that General Chang Hsiin&apos;s policy would render the Cabinet/s tenure of office precarious. Meanwhile, signs were increasing in the South of a demand for the election of a new Parliament. Shortly before dawn on 1st July the situation was dramatically solved by General Chang lIsiuFs coup cVetat, in the execution of which he adhered closely to the precedents established by the late Empress Dowager. The restoration of the Monarchy has since been announced by Imperial Decrees, proclaiming an end. of the misfortunes and abuses to which the people have been brought, by Republicanism. The old order is re-establised,&apos;together with the Dragon Throne, under a Council of Regency consisting of Chang Hsun, Hsu Shih-Ch&apos;ang, Kang Yu-wei, and Liang Tun-Ten. Mr. Alston expects that both the Moderate and Progressive parties of politicians will oppose the . Restoration.; for the present, however, Peking remains undisturbed, and the streets are beflagged with dragon banners. On the 3rd unconfirmed rumours were current at the capital that the Military Governor of Chili had called upon Chang Hsun and his troops to leave Peking within 2-i hours. Also that General Feng Kuo-chang (the Vice-President) had proclaimed a provisional Government at Nanking, with Tuan Chi-jui as Premier.   President Li has sought refuge in the Japanese Legation.His Majesty&apos;s Minister is now of opinion that the question of China&apos;s declaring Avar must be regarded as shelved, as the Imperialist faction are ail against it. In this connection the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Tokio informed Sir C. Greene on 29th June that the uncertainties and difficulties with which the Chinese Government were then confronted seemed to preclude all immediate probability of the Cabinet&apos;s deciding to declare war ; he doubted whether their hesitation would be overcome by any offer that the Allies could make. In reply. Sir C. Greene stated that His Majesty:s Government were quite convinced that the effort was worth making and urged that the Japanese Government should co-operate to that end.Certain German Consular officials have been permitted by the Chinese authorities to remain at Shanghai at the request of the Dutch Minister, ostensibly to. assist the notoriously pro-German Dutch Consul-General in the supervision and protection of German interests. As it has now been reported that these and other German officials at Shanghai are intriguing with Sun Vat-sen, Mr. Alston has been instructed by the
Foreign Office to endeavour to obtain the deportation of all German Consular officers.. The. moment would appear to be opportune for securing their removal, as the German Government are asking the Chinese Government to secure safe conducts for the repatriation of the German officials and their families, formerly stationed at Tsing-tao. The Allied Ministers are in favour of the request being granted, on the ground that these individuals would be less harmful to the Allies in Germany than in China.JAPAN.On. 23th dune Sir C. Greene renewed the request put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the end of May (vide Report No. 19) for an allocation of Japanese mercantile tonnage to meet, the urgent needs of the Allies. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the matter is receiving careful atteution, but there are many difficulties in the way owing to the great congestion of goods already awaiting shipment in Japan.According to a statement made to the Foreign Office by the Belgian Minister in London, the Japanese Government have informed the Belgian Minister in Tokio, that they will not oppose Belgian participation in the Consortium for Chinese loans, provided His Majesty&apos;s Government agrees thereto. Sir C. Greene has been instructed, in his discretion, to remind the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Great Britain&apos;s assent to the proposed Belnian participation was notified to the Japanese Ambassador on 14th May. -ARGENTINA.On the 30th June, the Senate unanimously adopted a resolution expressing gratification at the intention manifested by the President of the Republic to extend friendly hospitality to the United States squadron which is about to visit South American waters. Public opinion, a-s reflected in the Press of Buenos Aires, is all in favour of a demonstrative welcome.On 3rd July Sir R. Tower reported that the Argentine Government were about to address a strong representation to the German Government requesting an under-taking on their part to respect the. Argentine flag.in future. They contemplate the possibility of a consequent rupture of diplomatic relations.BRAZIL.The President signed a Decree on the 28th of June, annulling the act of neutrality of 1914 in favour of all the Allied Powers. Sir A. Peel understands that this action was suddenly decided ripon, because the Brazilian Government were unable to obtain the loan they required from the United States for purposes of military equipment and industrial development.His Majesty&apos;s Government are considering, in consultation, with the United States Government, the question of a partial relaxation of the embargo on Brazilian coffee. They are disposed to admit under licence -a small proportion of the normal imports, although there are ample reserve stocks in Great Britain, if the coffee is brought in on any of the ex-German ships seized by the Brazilian Government, and if these vessels carry other cargo of national importance.VENEZUELA.The Telefunker Company are negotiating with the Venezuelan Government to obtain a concession for the erection of a wireless station on the island of Margarita (about 50 miles from the mainland halfway between Caracas and the island of Trinidad).3441-1 IC
-    .       &apos; MEXICO.There are indications that- financial causes are operating to induce a change of policy, if not of heart, in Senor Carranza. He has inspired a Press campaign in &quot; El Universal &quot; advocating Mexico&apos;s entrance into the war on the side of the Entente. Mr. Cummins doubts whether it will be possible for him to effect this volte-face, in view of the hostility towards the United States widespread throughout Mexico, but should an understanding (based, on financial assistance) be feasible, he considers that, as a condition preliminary thereto, the United States Government should insist on tire restitution of British property and certain amendments to the proposals for taxation contained in the new Constitution.On 1st July the United States Ambassador at Mexico informed Mr. Cummins that he proposed, before leaving for AVashington, to ask Sehor Carranza for a definite statement of his intentions in the matter of oil legislation and taxation. In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s representative, however, the United States Ambassador is lacking in firmness and would like to conciliate Carranza by shifting protests and other disagreeable work on to his colleagues. Sir 0. Spring Rice regards this policy as unfortunate and because of it considers it desirable that the representatives of European countries should be wholly or partially withdrawn from Mexico. The Mexican Government particularly dislike having to deal with, the United States alone, and for this very reason His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington thinks they should, be left to do so. On 29th June he reported that the State Bepartment were endeavouring to arrange for the despatch of a warship to Puerto Mexico where the Germans have been instigating an attack by rebels on the Mihatetlan Refinery AVorks.CUBA.The Cuban Government are anxious to take over and use for trading purposes an Austrian steamer, the &quot; Virginia,&quot; now lying in Havana harbour. The Consul-General for Austria (a perniciously active German, named Paetzold) raises no objection and the owners are willing. The Secretary of State therefore approached Mr. Beech and enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government will agree to the change of flag. He was advised to communicate the request through the Cuban Minister in London. Mr. Leech suggests that the Cuban Government be advised that the simplest and best way of acquiring the vessel is to break off relations with Austria and hand Mr. Paetzolcl his passport.UNITED STATES.A. recent despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at AVashington (9th June) observes that a certain natural re-action on the subject of the war has become noticeable, which manifests itself in a critical attitude towards the measures proposed by the Executive. Mr. BalfouFs Mission undoubtedly achieved great results in promoting real sympathy and understanding between the British and American peoples, but enthusiasm has since been somewhat checked by a growing sense of the gravity of the situation and its effect upon American interests. Moreover, party feeling in politics still runs high. The Republicans maintain that the persons who are directing the war administration are generally selected by the President for party reasons and they do not wish to contribute to the success of his next Presidential campaign. Finally, there is always a real danger that the American people may be led. to believe that the Allies, having led them into the war, are now trying to control its conduct and to dispose of the resources provided by the United States.In another Despatch (14th June) Sir 0. Spring Rice discussing the increase of German propaganda and pacifist influences, refers particularly to the anxiety created by the attitude and action of Mr. Denman, the Chairman of the Shipping Board, whose willingness to promote German interests combined with his unconcealed hostility to Great Britain, constitutes a dangerous element in the situation. Attention has been drawn in the Senate to his pernicious activities and to his endeavours to get rid of General Goethals. The War Department, is directed by Mr. Baker, a very able man, but an avowed pacifist; he is assisted by three persons of similar convictions, and Jewish extraction. In some respects the policy of the Department reflects these convictions.
Lord Northcliffe, telegraphing for the information of the Prime Minister on the 30th of June, expresses the opinion that, although the movement is slow, the American people are surely moving towards Avar on a gigantic scale. Their inventors, hacked by financiers, are at work- on new engines of Avar of characteristic ingenuity.With regard to the prohibition of exports and the definition, of a policy towards neutrals, Sir C. Spring Rice reported on the 1st of July that as the result of the inefficiency of the State Department on the one hand and. the obstruction of the Shipping Board on the other, the issue of the Presidents proclamation had been suspended. The policy proposed by the hood Controller&apos; (Mr. Hoover) and tlie Department of Commerce will probably involve a complete cessation of all cereal exports to neutrals for the next three months. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador desires to be informed in aa-that cases the United States should advise neutrals to obtain, supplies from Australia or the Argentine.Count PPorodyski has discussed AAdth Mr. Lansing his scheme for the enrolment in the United States of 100,000 Polish recruits, to be,trained in Canada before the winter under Polish officers Avhorn he hopes to obtain from Russia. He desires that the United. States Government, taking note of the new Russian Governments proclamation assuring Polish autonomy, should authorise recruiting, and at the same time recognise a provisional Polish Government. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador thinks that the project Avill be supported by the PTnited States Government, if they come to the conclusion that it is likely to succeed.Instructions have been issued by the State Department to ail United: States diplomatic and consular officials to co-operate fully and frankly with their colleagues of Allied Governments. British Missions and Consulates in all neutral countries haA^e been similarly instructed to work in close co-operation with their United States colleagues.THE SHIPPING SITUATION.Referring to Germany&apos;s proposal to transfer seven German ships lying at Batavia to the Dutch flag, as compensation for the torpedoing of six Dutch steamers, Sir W. ToAvnley recommends that His Majestj^s GoA-ernmeuts recognition of such a transfer should be conditional on Holland&apos;s recognition of Great BritaiiPs requisitioning of Dutch vessels. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Batavia advises that, in the event of the transfer taking place and the ex-German ships proceeding to Holland, steps shordd be taken to pre\rent their carrying the large stocks of produce recently acquired by Germans in the Dutch Indies.There are other projects afoot in Holland for acquiring German tonnage uoav lying iu South American and. Dutch Colonial harbours, it being understood that Germany is hoav prepared to sanction the sale of these vessels. The would-be purchasers, who are initiating negotiations in Berlin, on the subject, - have asked Sir W. Townkw upon Avhat conditions His Majesty&apos;s Government would consent to the change of flag ; they consider that the proposed deal would be to the advantage of the Allies.The Danish Government having accepted the Shipping Agreement negotiated, by the Danish delegates in London, orders were given by His- Majesty&apos;s Government on 29th June for the release of all Danish vessels detained in British, ports, except in cases of questionable cargoes. On 3rd July Captain Cold drew the attention of Sir R. Paget to the continued detention in United States ports of some 15 vessels loaded with fodder stuff for Denmark, Avhose cargoes are rapidly deteriorating. Danish shipowners are under the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not acting in the spirit of the arrangements concluded in London ; they particularly object to the prolonged uncertainty of the present situation, and they are convinced that any restrictions on exports imposed by the United States Government ivill be dictated, or at least prompted by, Great Britain.Steps are being taken to ensure representation of all sections of the mercantile marine in Sweden, Nonvay and Denmark at the International Conference, which it is proposed to hold in London on 24th July, to discuss Germany&apos;s methods of submarine warfare.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.Amongst recent arrivals at Stockholm are the Irish-American Gaffney and the Irish agitator Chatterton Hill, lately assistant to Stanhope at Berlin in the editing of
the &quot;Continental Times.&quot; : These two have suggested to.the Dutch Scandinavian. Committee.that they should invite a delegation of Irish Socialists to Stockholm; they have also issued a manifesto of Irish independence. Sir E. Howard enquired -on 27th June whether lie should apply for the expulsion of Hill.At the Scandinavian Inter-Parliamentary Conference held at Christiania at the end of last week, the chief subject for discussion was the attitude of neutral countries towards the &quot; Peace League of Nations &quot; idea. It was hoped that the German official spy and explosives organisations would also receive the attention of the delegates.According to information supplied to Sir E. Howard, the opinions expressed by the German Minority Socialists at Stockholm, were extremely frank in their condem-nation of the German Government. Their views on the war appear, in fact, to coincide at most points with those of the British Majority Socialists. As the German Minority delegates represent, by far the greater part of the populations of Berlin and Leipzig, their opinions have created no little impression at Stockholm, and are regarded as indicative of an. impending revolution in Germanj7. The delegation consisted of Bernstein, Haase, Kautsky, Stadthagen, Herzfeld, Hofer, Ledebour, Wengels and Oscar Cohn. In the course of a speech before the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee, Herr Bernstein said that any general Conference could, not avoid discussing the question of responsibility for the war ; it would have to be settled by the light of the various official documents published. He declared that the German Majority Socialists are still inspired by militarist ideas in regard to the future of Belgium, Poland, Turkey and Alsace-Lorraine.GENERAL.The Dutch Government having expressed their willingness (29th June) to intern at least 1 2,000 combatant and civilian prisoners of war (half of whom would be British and half German), Lord Newton strongly urged acceptance of this arrangement, if the Germans would agree to it; he advised sending 4,000 combatant and i;,000 civilian German prisoners from Great Britain. Without committing themselves definitely in regard to the numbers and the proportion of combatants to civilians, His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted the proposal on 1st July. It was eventually agreed between the British and German Missions, subject to ratification, that 16,000 British and German prisoners will be interned in Holland, viz., 7,500 invalid combatants, 6,500 officers and non-commissioned officers who have been over IS months in captivity, and 2,000 invalid civilians. At the same time (2nd July) Lord Newton reported that satisfactory agreements had been concluded with regard to all the other items on the Agenda (vide Report No. 21). The only question outstanding is the selection of the British port where exchanges are to be carried out. The Zeeland Steamship Company have suggested, either Lowestoft or Yarmouth, and are prepared to make arrangements for transporting about 750 prisoners weekly from each side. The German delegates pressed for Southwold and decline to accept any port in the Thames estuary.Information has been received by the Foreign Office to the effect that the Netherlands Minister at Constantinople is old and lacking in energy, closely associated with the Turks and married to a German wife. Lord Newton has therefore been directed to make arrangements, if possible, with the Dutch authorities for the sending of a suitable official to take charge of British interests in Turkey.
