APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT, No.  .1.7.Canada.Sir R. Bordeus decision to enforce compulsory service in Canada lias no doubt been made easier by the enactment of compulsory service in the United,States. But even so it is a decision requiring, no little courage, in, view, not only of the generally individualist traditions of Canada, Imt more particularly , of the opposition which the measure is certain to encounter from the French Nationalist Party in Quebec.Greece.The situation in Greece is hastening to its crisis. Amiable references to a possible reconciliation still find their place in the diplomatic correspondence. But M. Venizelos is dead against reconciliation in any shape or form, and the French are eager for a ooup which will secure them the control of Greece before the Central Powers can strike heavily against Salonika. The only real question now is whether the Greeks are sufficiently reduced in spirit to give up the Thessalian crop without fighting. If they do then the French policy will have succeeded, and the deposition of King Constantino and the Franco-Venizelist occupation of Greece will follow in due&apos; course. If, on the other hand they make any serious resistance, the whole position of the Allied Force at Salonika may become one of the greatest gravity.Serbia.The nature of the alleged conspiracy for which a large number of Serbian officers were arrested and tried at Bizerta, and for which some are said to have been sentenced to death, is still obscure. The Serbian troops seem again to have distinguished themselves in the mountain fighting of the last three weeks. But the possibility of their throwing up the contest in despair and deserting to the enemy, once they realise that the Salonika Force is not going to achieve any success this year, must be reckoned with. It must be remembered that for nearly two years neither officers nor men have, with the rarest exceptions, ever heard a word of the very existence of their wives and -families.German and Austrian Affairs.The Central Empires are evidently hard at work making their internal readjust-ments in order to present a common front when it comes to negotiations with Russia or the Entente. Austria has, apparently, secured her price for the effective support of German policy in the shape of a definite decision that the Polish crown shall go to the Archduke Charles Stephen. This will make it easier to agree to the reunion of Galicia with Poland, and thus both keep the Poles with the Central Powers and help to solve the Austrian internal problem by leaving the Germans in a safe majority in &apos; the Austrian Reichsrath.
The suggested partition of Alsace-Lorraine, by which Alsace and the eastern districts of Lorraine are to be incorporated in Bavaria, and form an extension of the Bavarian Palatinate, while other districts of Lorraine are to be annexed to the Rhine Province of Prussia, is no less significant. Prussia gets control of the iron-field ; Bavaria is directly enlisted in the cause of holding out to the last rather than surrender Alsace to the French ; the cession, on the other hand, of Metz and French-speaking south-western Lorraine is made easier.The Far East.The lack of whole-hearted co-operation on the part of Japan in making offers to induce China to join the Allies is, no doubt, largely due to the fact that the United States have entered the war. Japan looks upon the United States as the chief obstacle to her policy of acquiring control over China. The entry of the United States into the war and the growing intimacy of their relations with the British Empire confront Japan with the danger, after the war, of an actual or virtual Anglo-American Alliance based on the support of Chinese independence and of the open door in China. From the point of view of Japanese ambitions this is so serious a prospect that it may compel Japan to revise her whole attitude towards the Anglo-Japanese alliance.Peace Discussions.The chief pre-occupation of the Governments on both sides at this moment seems to be to explain that the particular annexations and indemnities which they want are not annexations or indemnities within the terms of the Russian declaration, and to hope that their respective Socialists may convert the Socialists of allied or enemy countries to their point of view on this issue.L.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.In pursuance of the Resolution passed at the Imperial War Conference in favour of the control of wool production for the period following the war, the Board of Trade are engaged in the formation of a Committee to work out the details, and the: British Government have invited the Dominion Governments to nominate expert representatives to serve upon this Committee. The Australian Government in reply-to the invitation have asked for further details as to the functions of the Committee and. the exact representation accorded to each country upon it.The Dominion Governments have been informed that the Blue Book dealing with the proceedings of the Imperial War Conference will be published on 24th May.. CANADA.In the Dominion House of Commons on 18th May, Sir Robert Borden announced, (according to Press cables) that compulsory service on a selective basis will be resorted to by the Government in order to maintain the full strength of the Canadian Divisions at the front.In reply to the suggestion of the Canadian Director of Recruiting, . the Prime Minister of the Dominion has been informed that very few prisoners of war could be sent to Canada for labour purposes, as large numbers of them are already engaged in the United Kingdom and on the lines of communication in France. It is further thought that the transport of such prisoners oversea would be utilised by the enemy as an excuse for reprisals.As to the requisitioning of ships now in course of construction in Canadian yards for neutral countries, the Dominion Government state that they have intimated their intention to requisition for the British authorities two vessels at present being built for neutral account at the Thor Iron &quot;Works.With reference to the request for the supply of a second quantity of 300 miles of rails for France,1 the British authorities have telegraphed to enquire the earliest date that these could be ready for shipment as they are urgently required.On the representation of the Acting High Commissioner, the present arrangements for the purchase of nickelin Canada will be continued for another three months  including the employment of Merton &amp; Co. as agents of the International Nickel Company. The Minister of Munitions, however, does not wish that Mertons should be maintained in this employment beyond the period mentioned, and he does not want anything to interfere with the arrangement that purchases of nickel should be conducted through the Imperial Munitions Board of the Dominion.As to the construction of motor boats for Italy,2 the Admiralty now find that the Italian Government are making other arrangements and will not, therefore, require them to be built in Canada.The Dominion Government have pointed out that the arrangement by which British vessels at New York ship only American cheese, while vessels of the United States take both Canadian and American cheese, is not fair to Canadian producers oil this commodity, and places the Government in a difficult position.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.In agreeing to the principle of the suggestion, made by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth as to sharing the cost of the storage of flour,3 the Wheat commission See Western and General Report for week ending 2nd May 1917.- See Western and General Report for weeks ending 11th and 25tli April 1917.3 Sec Western and General Report for weeks ending 9th and 16th May 1917.
have telegraphed stating that they are endeavouring to secure the agreement of the Allies upon this matter, and also as to the price, &amp;c.The Commonwealth Ministers, in response to the outline of the shipping position forwarded by the Shipping Controller, have expressed themselves as fully alive to the seriousness of the problem and its influence upon the war. They readily agree to put at the disposal of the British Government all vessels that are not essential for Australian coastal service.The Minister of Works has announced (by statement to the Press) that the Trans-continental Railway, connecting Port Augusta in South Australia with JCalgoorlie in Western Australia, will be opened early in September next.Arising out of a Despatch of the Japanese Ambassador, the Commonwealth Government have enquired whether British subjects in the Marshall&apos; Islands are extended the same trading rights as the Japanese, as an earlier Despatch seemed to imply that privileges were given to only one firm. The Commonwealth Government express the hope that the expression &quot;same treatment to Japanese subjects as to British subjects &quot; in relation to territory captured by the British, is limited to those trading facilities sought for the firm in the Marshall Islands, as, failing this limitation, Japanese subjects would be receiving benefits which have not been sought for British subjects in the territory captured by the Japanese.SOUTH AFRICA.With reference to the purchases of maize, the Secretary of State has informed the Governor-General that since the 5th April the Wheat Commission have bought 13,800 tons of the 1917 crop, and that prior to that date they purchased 130,000 tons of that crop for shipment from July to November.In reply to the enquiry as to the treatment of Jews in Palestine,1 the Union Government have been informed that during the Passover the whole Jewish community Avas driven from Jaffa towards the North. The houses of these people have been looted with the approval of the Turks, and all avIio resisted Avere hanged. As thousands are starving on the roads, the British authorities approve the formation of a local Committee in order to raise funds2 for their relief.BASUTOLAND.It is proposed that the three Basuto Chiefs, who are to visit France for the purpose-of investigating the conditions and arrangements for the welfare of the Basuto Labour Contingent, should remain in France for not less than one month but not more than three months.ij EAST AFRICA PROTECTORATE.While the Officer Administering the Government is unable to give a definite assurance that compulsory service for natiA7es Avill not lead to unrest,3 he has expressed the view that no trouble can possibly7 arise from the proposed course. He therefore asks for authority to amend the Ordinance, as the military authorities consider the Government ought to possess the power sought.It is reported that a tribal disturbance has broken out in the northern part of Turkana, but the latest reports are reassuring.GERMAN EAST AFRICA.The Administrator has been informed that with the concurrence of the German Government a sum of 60,000 marks will be sent for the relief of German Avomen and1 See Western and General Report for week ending 18th May 1917. 2 A similar telegram.has been sent to Canada.3 See Western and General Report for week ending 2nd May 1917.
children now in British hands. The German Government have asked for particulars of their interned subjects in German East Africa and other colonies, and state that the.y consider they are at liberty to take any steps they deem necessary in consequence of the internment of women and children. The British Government have replied that lists of interned persons are sent to the Prisoners of War Information Bureau and are forwarded to Germany, and women and children have only been interned when it was judged necessary in order to secure their protection or for military purposes.NYASALAND.General Nor they has reported, by telegram dated 16th May, that enemy raiders crossed the Nyasaland border near Mangoche (east of Fort Johnston) during the week but retired when British troops advanced. The enemy in the Matakas country now consists of about 60 Europeans and 400 native soldiers and many native levies. An enemy force is also proceeding south towards Tunduru, and is expected to advance into Portuguese, East Africa, where the natives will welcome them in preference to the Portuguese. General Northey has moved his headquarters to Zomba, the 5th South Infantry (250 men) to Mangoche and half of the 1st Battalion King&apos;s African Rifles (350 men) to Fort Johnston. Pie states that his small force now covers 700 miles, and until lie is permitted to bring troops from north of Nyasa he is unable to concentrate.In telegraphing to the Governor of Nyasaland, the Secretary of State has pointed out that the provisional occupation by the Belgians of that portion of German East Africa where they are now located has become more definite. Bismarckburg has been selected as the base for the Tanganyika flotilla, but the senior naval officer has been asked for a confidential report as to the best base for a flotilla in German East Africa if it should be determined in the future to maintain the British command of Lake Tanganyika.NIGERIA.The Governor-General of Nigeria has been informed that with the exception of salt all foodstuffs for West Africa must be obtained from the United States.1CEYLON.The Governor telegraphs that it would not be possible to form a burgher company for active service, as the community would be too small to maintain it. Further, the utilisation of only one portion of the people would cause much offence. It is added that many Sinhalese have already gone home at their own or the Governments expense, and it is believed they have acquitted themselves satisfactorily when serving with British regiments.HONG KONG.In reply to, the enquiry addressed to him, the Governor states that if compulsion were applied to all those engaged in non-essential businesses, about 125 men could be obtained without much effect on general trade.1 Similar telegrams have been sent to the Governors of the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia.
part ii.-foreign affairs.ALLIED COMMON AFFAIRS.Subject to the approval of the Italian Government, it has been arranged that the Allied Conference on the subject of Italy&apos;s silk exports to Germany and other connected questions of blockade policy will be held in Paris on the 5th June. The French Government agree that it is advisable that the United States should be represented at the Conference.ITALY.The decisions recorded at the Paris Conference in regard to the&apos; new Balkan policy were duly communicated to the Russian and Italian Governments by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Petrograd and Rome. On 18th May, Sir R. Rodd reported that as the result of his communication to Baron Sonnino on the subject, the latter had expressed his dissatisfaction with a method oi: procedure which, had excluded Italy from the discussion of grave questions in which she is directly and deeply interested. He recognised the necessity for the momentous . decisions taken by Great Britain at the Paris Conference, but felt keenly that Italy should have been ignored in their discussion. As regards the position and prospects in Greece, he did not admit that military predominance at Salonika necessarily justified the subordination of Allied diplomacy at Athens to the French representative. He feared&quot; that the final result of this policy would be a military occupation of Greece by France, a result which the world at large would condemn. But whatever the result, his own position as Minister for Foreign Affairs had been rendered very difficult vis-a-vis his colleagues ; he con-si dered that he had a right to expect that the British Government would consult him before deciding matters of such momentous importance.In reply to these observations Sir R. Rodd was directed to convey to Baron Sonnino an expression of His Majesty&apos;s Governments regret, and to explain the difficulty in which they were placed at the Paris Conference by reason of Baron Sonnino s inability to accept their pressing invitation to attend it. This being so, Italy and Russia were only represented in Paris by their Ambassadors, and as it was not possible, under the existing political conditions, to admit the Russian Ambassador to the Conference, the exclusion of his Italian colleague offered the only solution of a delicate situation. Sir It. Rodd conveyed this explanation, frankly and in great confidence, to Baron Sonnino on 20 di May.In last weelts Report it was recorded that His Majesty&apos;s Government had informed the Italian Ambassador that they had no objection to the shipment of coal from the United States to Italy in American bottoms. After further consideration of the question, and consultation with the Ministry of Shipping, the Foreign Office have directed Sir R. Rodd (19th May) to point out that the carriage of coal from the United States to Italy involves a wasteful use of tonnage and. that it would be economically advantageous to allow the shipping now engaged on behalf of the Italian Government in bringing cargoes of grain from America, to be diverted to the transport of coal from the United Kingdom; at the same time &quot;American tonnage should be employed in substitution for the Italian and British vessels now engaged in United States trade. In this connection Lord Bertie reported on 22nd May that the French authorities are now making improved landing arrangements and providing increased rolling stock so as to permit of transporting to Italy up to 1,-100 tons of coal daily. All the labour employed in handling the coal will be Italian. The French Railway Administration has received instructions to confer with the Italian Railway authorities and arrange the necessary details.The Italian Government have withdrawn all restrictions against the importation into Italy of prohibited goods from the United Kingdom, in consideration of the favourable treatment conceded to Italian goods in Great Britain.
GREECE.On 17tlx May His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Athens and His Majesty&apos;s agent at Salonika were ixxforxxxed by the Foreign Office that the French Goyernilxent had appointed M. Jonnart to be their representative, with direction of affairs, in Greece. At the same time the Secretary of: State for Foreign Affairs took occasion to lay stress on the necessity for concerted action, directed towards re-establishing the unity of Greece, a policy which caxx only be attained by effecting a reconciliation between the Venizelist and Royalist parties. Should the Fling and the Gx-eek Government at Athens fail to assist in promoting this policy, the Allied Governments may be compelled to consider the deposition of the King ; in the meanwhile, however, everything possible should be -done to prevent disturbance, and the Venizelists should be advised in their own interests to keep the peace. The British Government have proposed a further discussion of Greek affairs to be held in London, at which, it is suggested, M. Ribot and General Foch should attend, accompanied, if possible, by M. Jonnart.Referring to these instructions, Sir F. Elliot replied (18th May) that the Zaimis -Government are sincerely anxious to pursue a policy of reconciliation, and have hopes of achieving success ; much depends, however, on the willingness of M. Venizelos and dxis adherents to meet them half way. The Cabinet contains two Venizelist members, who believe that the King is prepared to make liberal advances in the direction of a democratic constitution. Sir F. Elliot suggested that it would be a graceful indication of confidence in the good intentioixs of the Zaimis Ministry if General Sarrail were to sanction, an increase in the forces at the disposal of the authorities at Athens and in, the provinces, their present, strength being inadequate to suppress ordinary crime, much lessasuddeix outbreak of disorder. Finally, he advised an imxxxediate x-elaxation of the blockade, so as to permit the resunxption of the coastixxg trade and fishing.Lord Granville, acting upon, the same instructions, had a long conversation with M. Venizelos on the 22nd. M. Venizelos declared himself once and for all opposed to the idea of a reconciliation with King Constantino, which he would regard as an unpardonable crime against his country. He was prepared to accept the accession of the Crown Prince, fautc tie mieux, on condition that immediately upon the conclusion of peace, a Constitutional Assembly be convened, to define the powers of the sovereign and the basis of the Constitxition. Uixder no circunxstaxxces woxxld he axxd his frieixds -consent to King Coxxstantiixe retaining the Throne. He repudiated with indignation Sir F. Elliots statement that certain members of the Zaimis Cabinet are Venizelists ; the individuals iix question may have been political associates of his in the past. bixt. they had proved themselves traitors to the national cause by acceptiixg office at Athens. In his opinion, M. Zaimis was actuated more by loyalty to the King than by patriotism, and his desire to save the situation was misguided. As the result of this coxxversation. Lord Granville expressed the opinion that the best chance of px-eservhxg united Greece under the monarchy and preventing bloodshed lies in the immediate abdication, of King Coixstaxxtiue.Telegraphing on the 22xxd, Sir F. Elliot amplified his views. He deprecated any haste ixx forming opinioxxs or taking action on ,the situation, for the reason that M. Zaimis is compelled to act cautiously and play for time. For the present he is subject to attacks by the Veixizelists on the oxie hand, for opposing their drastic plans, axxd by the Royalists on the other for his conciliatory attitude. Tactful words of warning from the Allies should serve to curb the Venizelists&apos; impatience and some assurance of appreciation from the Exxtente to M. Zaimis would go far to promote his policy of pacification. That policy is still endangered by the activities of Gounarists and other violently Royalist factions.With a view to enabling the Greek Government to purchase the harvest in Thessaly on behalf of the Allied Governments, Sir F. Elliot communicated a draft agreement to M. Zaimis oix 19th May whereby, inter alia, it was stipulated that the Allies woxxld advaxice the purchase vahxe of the crops, estimated at 21 million pounds, oix coixdition that the stocks be placed under the control of the Allied Board in Athens. The Board would distribute the grain as required by old and xxew Greece axxd by the Allied Army in Macedonia. M. Zaimis replied on 23rd May, accepting these proposals in principle, but considerably modifying them in effect by coxxnter-stipulatioxxs. He is willing to accept control of the stocks by the Allied Board at Athens, but desires that the Greek Government should finance the purchase of the harvest on its owxr account and without assistance. Thereafter, half the surplus stocks in Thessaly would be purchasable by the Allies, to use as they might think fit, on conditioix that the
quantity of wheat thus used be replaced by the delivery of an equal quantity at the-Piraeus, to the order of the National Bank. The other half of the surplus stock would be reserved by the Greek Government for the use of the urban population in Thessaly. Sir F. Elliot considers that an agreement on these lines is feasible, and that the only logical alternative lies in occupation of the country.In this connection. Lord Granville has pointed out that if the collecting and purchasing of the harvest is to be effectively controlled by General sarrail&apos;s military posts in Thessaly, there is not much time to spare, for according to M. Venizelos the barley crop would be harvested by 20th May and the wheat by 10th June. Sir F. Elliot was instructed on the 21st to ascertain definitely, in consultation, with Lord Granville, and to report, how soon the wheat, barley and maize crops should be available for consumption. There are at present nine Greek ships loading grain in American ports which cannot reach Greece before the end of June and several others are preparing to sail for India, there to load grain provided for Greece by the Wheat Commission ; these vessels may be diverted with their cargoes to France or Italy; if the Thessalian harvest should be available for consumption within the next few weeks.. In reply to the above enquiries, Sir F. Elliot states that the result of the wheat harvest should be known in about three weeks and that of the maize crop in August. In the meanwhile, he deprecates any modification in the arrangements made for the grain cargoes from America, as these nine shiploads are calculated to provision Greece only until 20th July.Lord Granville has again drawn attention to the proceedings of the Russians at Mount Athos (vide Reports Nos. 10 and 11). The Provisional Government informs him that General Sarrail has declined to permit them to send a diplomatic repre-sentative to inquire into the situation and the Bishop of Cassandra has also been prevented, from proceeding thither on ecclesiastical duty. Lord Bertie has been instructed to request that the French Government may communicate any information which they may possess on the subject.The military patrols on the Corinth Canal are now working without friction, in accordance with the arrangement proposed by General Cauboue, whereby the Greeks remain on the south side of the Canal.From Salonika, Lord Granville reports the discovery of a plot to assassinate M. Venizelos. It is alleged to have been instigated from Athens by persons of no great political importance. lie also reports the impending arrival of the Cretan Division at Salonika, and renews the inquiry whether they may be allowed to serve on the British, front.. The Minister of Education at Athens is bringing his influence to bear on the priesthood of the independent synod at Salonika to cease from political propaganda. A statement has been published by the Salonika Press Bureau to the effect that the 4th. Greek Army Corps has been enrolled in the Bulgarian Army and is now behind the Monastir lines.M. Venizelos returned to Salonika from Crete on the 19th May. He had a most cordial reception in the island, and declared himself extremely pleased with the success of the mobilisation and the enthusiasm it has evoked.MONTENEGRO.Understanding that the Ring of Montenegro is endeavouring to raise a loan in the United States against grants of mining concessions, His Majesty &apos;s Government have instructed Sir C. Spring Rice, acting in concert with his French colleague, to inform the Government at Washington that Great Britain and France have assumed financial responsibility7 for Montenegro, and provided the Montenegrin Government with all necessary7 assistance.SERBIA.On 19th May, Sir C. des Graz was requested by the Foreign Office to obtain, if possible, from non-official sources, further information concerning the trial and death sentence passed on Colonel Dimitrievitch and other officers by the Serbian Govern -ment, and the probable effect of the Governments action on public opinion in Serbia and on the Serbian Army. On the 22nd he replied that he had not been able to obtain any further information.The Prime Minister and other members of the Government went to meet the Prince Regent at florina on 19th May.   They expect to return to Corfu before the.
GERMAN AFFAIRS.The &quot; Frankfurter,&quot; dutifully applauding the OhancelloFs refusal to commit himself to any clear statement&apos; of Germany&apos;s peace programme, observes: &quot;Once &quot; again the Chancellor has proved that Kaiser, Army, and Parliament are all of one &quot; mind ; nor can it be tolerated any longer that the extremists of either party should. &quot; discuss either Scheidemanhs peace or Hinderiburg&apos;s peace, whilst the Chancellor &quot; possesses the complete approval of the Kaiser, of all Germany&apos;s Allies, of the larger &quot; States and the Army.&quot;The same organ, emphasising the Chancel lots denial that any differences exist between Germany and her Allies on the subject of peace - terms, declares that perfect agreement prevails between him and Count Czernin &quot; although undoubtedly neither of them is as free in his actions as both might desire.&quot; The &quot; Deutsche Tageszeitung &quot; is convinced that, as the result of the complete agreement between the Chancellor and Count Czernin, renewed proposals for peace will soon be put forward, &quot;more or &quot; less definitely worded and approximating to Scheidemamts war aims as nearly as &quot; the other factors in the German Imperial situation render advisable at present.&quot; Nevertheless, Count Czernihs visit to German Headquarters, following so quickly upon these declarations of perfect agreement, has given rise to uneasy speculation in several quarters. The &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; says that this latest conversation between Count Czernin and the Chancellor has to do with the Polish question. Negotiations for the establishment of a Regency in &apos;paland, backed by a Polish Ministry, are discussed by the &quot;Frankfurter&quot; and the &quot; Weser Zeitung.&quot; The &quot; Magdeburger Zeitung&quot; recently announced that the Chancellor had purchased Austria&apos;s acquiescence in Germany&apos;s war policy by offering to confer the Polish throne on the Austrian Archduke Carl Stefan. According to an article in the conservative organ &quot; Die Post &quot; of 15th May, the adhesion of Bavaria to the Imperial policy was secured as the result of air agreement between the Chancellor and Herr Hertling, by virtue of which Bavaria will secure not only the whole of Alsace, but a considerable portion of Lorraine. This proposed partition of the Reichsland, for the aggrandisement of Bavaria, seems likely to evoke opposition in Saxony. The &quot; Vorvvarts &quot; describes the &quot; Posts &quot; alarming report as &quot;quite senseless.&quot; The &quot; Vossische,&quot; on the other hand, says that both Rhenish Westphalia and Bavaria have much to gain from the partition of -Alsace-Lorraine, and permission to exploit it in their own interests. The conservative &quot; Kreuz Zeitung&quot; observes that there exists a general conviction in Germany that Alsace-Lorraine must be partitioned, and that &quot;nobody will deny the expediency of accommodating Bavaria in this matter.&quot;Information from a reliable source shows that the Germans are making an efficient substitute for hemp by using the Dracaena plant ; His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Rotterdam, reports that they are buying up all available plants of this species in the Ghent district. Normally the seed of this plant is obtained from a Paris firm ; Mr. Maxse recommends that the French authorities be asked to prohibit its export.AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.The &quot; Neue Freie Presse,&quot; attacking the &quot; Saturday Review,&quot; for an article on the prospects of a separate peace between the Allies and Austria, declares that the Alliance with Germany rests not only on the will of the two Governments but upon the absolute conviction of the great majority of the Austrian people that it makes for the good of Austria-Hungary. Such utterances of the British. Press, it declares, are interesting only as evidence of the forlorn manoeuvres by which the British public is deluded into the belief of a successful end to the war. &quot; Otherwise, such a farcical &quot; idea as a separate peace between England and Austria could hardly be discussed. &quot; The depreciation of our political character implied by such an assumption is too V detestable to be dwelt upon.&quot;2962-4 Cend of the month. On the 22nd Lord Granville reported that the entire Serbian Government had arrived at Salonika on the 20th. The Provisional Government had received no notice of their coming, and had no information as to their intended movements, whereat the Minister for Foreign Affairs was uneasy and somewhat hurt.
HOLLAN D.With, the exception of the &quot; Telegraaf &quot; the entire Hutch Press has expressed incredulous dissatisfaction with the British Communique concerning the bombs dropped on Ziericksee, and resents the attempt to fasten on Germany the blame for the incident. The &quot; Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant,&quot; in particular, has expressed itself in terms so hostile and insulting that Sir W. Townley has been compelled to-draw the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the offeusiveness of its language. The Minister expressed his profound regret and undertook to speak severely to the editor. Sir W. Townley observed that the Dutch Government had taken action at law against the &quot; Telegraaf &quot; for language far less offensive directed&apos; against Germany and that, if.they could not deal equally firmly with the &quot;Courant,&quot; it would be impossible to avoid the conclusion that Hollands neutrality was something more than benevolent to the Central Powers.SWEDEN.The Swedish Government have now officially prohibited Swedish fishing. boats from landing their catch outside Sweden after 25th Ma3T. The penalties for a breach of this regulation are severe.The Foreign Office do not consider it advisable to act upon Sir E. Howarcbs suggestion that His Majesty&apos;s Government should authorise him to state that they are not prepared to proceed further with ratification of the draft trade-and-transit agreement arranged with Count AVallenberg&apos;s administration. Such a declaration, it is thought, might afford the Swedish Government a Avelcome opportunity of charging Great Britain with bad faith ; a. policy of silent inactivity, leaving Sweden to make the first move, will probably afford the time necessary to arrange with the United States a common policy of united pressure in the matter, f the transit trade through Sweden to Russia. 1Discussing the essential conditions on which this common policy must be based, and its main purposes, Sir E. Howard observes that Swedeits staple supplies and her trade with Germany should not be too rigorously cut off, lest the country be either driven into war or reduced to semi-starvation. He recommends that pressure should be applied with such moderation as will obviate these extreme results and at the same time with force sufficient to serve the purposes of the Allies. As Sweden&apos;s export of iron ore to Germany constitutes by itself probably the largest contribution made to Germatry&apos;s munitions of war by any neutral country, and as the cessation of Swedish produce exports to the Allies is chiefly due to the pro-German attitude of Swedish shipowners, the problem of thus adjusting pressure must present considerable difficulties.Sir E. Howard reports that the sinking of the three Swedish foodships by German submarines has evoked a storm of indignation throughout Sweden. Mr. Branting has declared that an overwhelming majority of public opinion will now demand that no more food be exported to Germany and that iron ore exports be restricted.NORWAY.There have lately been frequent attacks on the Government in the Norwegian Press for allowing nickel to be exported to Germany, as the metal is largely used in the making of torpedoes. Sir M. Findlay reported on the IGth that the question of the Governments commandeering of all nickel stocks was being actively discussed in the Press, but be considered it improbable that, in the absence of extraneous pressure, the export would be prohibited. He suggested that this pressure might take the form of an arrangement by which the United States would continue to allow copper to be shipped to Norway so long as no nickel is exported to Germany.The Norwegian Government have undertaken to stop the export of butter except to Great Britain and Allied countries.DENMARK.Sir It. Paget forwards an opinion, similar to that of Sir E. Howard, concerning the possible effect of Anglo-American pressure if exercised to compel Denmark to cut off all exports to Germany. Mi&apos;. Andersen considers that, to avoid being attacked by Germany, Denmark would be compelled to forgo all imports from America.As a matter of necessity, however, Danish exports to Germany must automatically be reduced, by reason of the scarcity of commodities resulting from the submarine
&quot;blockade. In this connection, Sir R. Paget has been confidentially informed that the Danish Minister at Berlin recently intimated to the German Government that Denmark, having to provide for her own population, will gradually be compelled to cease from exporting produce to Germany. The German Governments reply to this intimation was to the effect that they regarded it as a threat, and the German military authorities would therefore have to consider how their interests could best be served. They thought that, in the first instance, their best move would be to strengthen their forces on the Danish frontier. With regard also to the Germans&apos; recent seizure of two produce boats and to the proceedings against them in the German Prize Court, Mr. Andersen anticipates that, if the Navy party obtain a decision in their favour, all possible means will be adopted to harass Danish shipping and to stop their trade with Great Britain. Pending the settlement of this case, Mr. Andersen considers it advisable to postpone for a little his visit, and that of the shipping delegates, to London.SPAIN.On 19th May Sir A. Hardinge requested the Spanish Government to formulate before 22nd May their proposed modifications of the Cortina agreement. On the 21st these were submitted, the Government proposing that the revised agreement should take the form of an exchange of notes. In reporting this matter His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador observed that all the attention of the Spanish authorities had lately been absorbed in the submarine crisis.Referring to the general policy of the Spanish Government, which the Cortina agreement is not likely to modify to any great extent, the Foreign Office directed Sir C. Spring Rice (18th May) to impress upon the United States Government the seriousness of Spain&apos;s attitude of continuous obstruction, inspired by German influences, and to urge &quot;the advisability of counteracting those influences forthwith by-taking a firm line of united policy, which might involve depriving Spain of- all supplies from Great Britain and from the United States. On 21st May, Sir C. Spring Rice replied, stating that instructions in the sense desired had been telegraphed to the United States Ambassador at Madrid.A report from His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Rotterdam appears to indicate that the Spanish Naval Authorities are calling up their reserves.PORTUGAL.Always a poor country, Portugal is rapidly being brought to a serious condition of distress by the economic pressure resulting from the war. On 17th May SirL. Carnegie reported that the coal crisis had become acute throughout the country; the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that Portugal had no ships to send to England, and he urged therefore that British vessels coming to Portugal for pit props should come with cargoes of coal, and not, as in many cases, in ballast. The Portuguese railways are at present, using wood, and the Lisbon gas supply&apos;- is suspended. On the 21st serious food riots took place in Lisbon, in the course of which, according to Press reports, 22 persons were killed and some 300 wounded. Martial law was proclaimed.CHINA.The Chinese Parliament, having adjourned in disorder on 10th May, did not meet again till the 20th. In the interval, the Presidents supporters in the Cabinet resigned, hoping to compel the Premier to do likewise on the ground that the Cabinet had ceased to exist. Tire Premier showed no disposition to give up either his official position, or his Avar policy. Relying on the support of the Provincial Military Governors (who have announced their intention of remaining in Peking until Parliament resolves on declaring war), he sent an official demand to Parliament on the 14th, calling for an early decision. The Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed the opinion to Sir C. Greene on the 19th that&apos; the Chinese Premier would succeed in obtaining a resolution in favour of war, and thereafter be able to reconstruct his Cabinet by compromising with the opposition. Or.&apos; 20th May, however, the situation showed no signs of amicable arrangement. The Lower House passed a vote postponing consideration, of the war resolution pending a reconstruction of the Cabinet; thereupon, the Premier, backed by the Military Governers, called upon the President to dissolve Parliament.   Mr. Alston reported on the 21st that the
President had refused to do so, and that the Premier would probably dissolve-Parliament on his own authority and that of the Army. On the 22nd the Military Governor of Peking left for Shantung, to confer with General Chang Hsiin in regard to supporting the Premier against the President and Parliament. On the same day,. Mr. Eugene Chen, editor of the &quot; Peking Gazette &quot; (whose claim to be a British subject is not recognised by Plis Majesty&apos;s Legation), was arrested by order of the Premier-British Consular reports from Szchuen and Yunnan state that there is no unusual political activity in the south, and justify the belief that the dissolution of Parliament, would not provoke disorder.Referring to the policy of the Japanese Government in China (as set forth in last week&apos;s Report), Sir C. Greene&apos; was instructed on the 18th to state that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government concur in the view that the present crisis is largely a matter of domestic politics, they are convinced that it would greatly strengthen the hands of the Premier if he were placed, in a position to announce the conclusion of an agreement with the Allies whereby China would -stand to gain important material advantages... China&apos;s declaration of war could not fail to produce considerable apprehension amongst traders and financiers in Germany. Eor these reasons it was hoped that the Japanese Government would now join in making to China the offer proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, to which the French, Russian, and Italian Governments have agreed.SIAM.Mr. Dering reports that a noticeable change is taking place in Siamese public-opinion, and a rupture of relations with Germany becoming possible. The Siamese Government are being led to perception of the fact that their position is unsatisfactory and may become uncomfortable, but this in his opinion affords an additional reason for the Allies to abstain front bringing any political pressure to bear on them. The King of Siam has no love for Germany, and will be quite ready to break off relations, whenever convinced that the interests of Siam will best be served by so doing; the matter should therefore be left to the unfettered decision of the Siamese Government.Mr. Dering mentions incidentally that the Japanese Minister not only objects to the Siamese Government being advised to sever relations with Germany, but that he is opposed to their deciding on such a step of their own accord. He fears that it might lead to some modification of extra-territorial rights, of which Japan is particularly tenacious ; also that it might be held to justify a request by the Siamese Government for increased Customs dues, a request of the kind &quot;-which, in China, was causing Japan much trouble.&quot;ARGENTINA.On. 17th May the Foreign Office directed Sir R. Tower to inform the Argentine Government that inasmuch as they had imposed no conditions in allowing the export of wheat to other countries, Plis Majesty&apos;s Government assume that they will now be willing to waive those which were made (i.e., concerning replacement) with respect to the 200,000 tons licensed-for export to England. To this the Minister of Agriculture replied, regretting his inability to relieve His Majesty &apos;s Government of the undertaking to replace this wheat if &quot;necessary ; it was the assurance thus given that had enabled him to allow other countries to ship a part of their purchases. He suggested that if the tonnage difficulty proved insuperable, the Wheat Commission^ stocks might either be resold on the spot or their shipment deferred ; his general attitude was one of courteous obstructiveness. In view of his attitude and of his positive refusal to guarantee the export hereafter of the balance of wheat purchased on behalf of Plis Majesty&apos;s Government, Sir R. Tower recommends that shipping be diverted as much .as possible from Argentine ports.An intercepted letter from the Foreign Office in Berlin, to the German Minister in Buenos Aires states the conditions under which the German Government are prepared to lease to the Argentine the German merchantmen now lying in Argentine waters ; these have been communicated for the information of His Majesty&apos;s representatives in the chief South American Republics. By these conditions, the vessels would be bound to sail only to German, or between neutral, ports ; they would have to be guaranteed immune from attack by all enemy powers ; they would be manned by officers and men of the Argentine navy; and would be returned to their German owners immediately upon the conclusion of peace.
BRAZIL.Having reference to the unconfirmed report-of Treaty negotiations between Rio de Janeiro and Washington (vide last Report), Doctor Ruy Barbosa has assured Sir A. Peel that the Brazilian Government will consult the British and French Govern-ments before concluding a commercial Treaty with the United States. From this, His Majesty&apos;s Minister infers that negotiations have, in fact, been proceeding. At the same time the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senor Pecanha, is by no means in a position to speak with certainty as to the extent to which Brazil will eventually co-operate with the United States, and will not be able to do so until Foreign Affairs Committees have been elected and conferred in both Houses of Parliament.The Brazilian Minister in London has intimated that unless means can be found to provide the supply of mineral oil required for the working of the Central Railway of Brazil, his Government may be compelled to prohibit the export of manganese ore to Great Britain and the United States. Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to suggest that as the United States Government are largely dependent on Brazil for this ore they might find it possible to provide the oil-carrying steamer required.URUGUAY.The tide continues to flow against Germany in South America. Uruguay, recovering from her fears of an attack by tbe German Colonists of the Rio Grande do Sul, is now disposed to declare war against Germany whenever Brazil does so.MEXICO.Mr. Cummings, His Majesty&apos;s Commercial Attache in charge of the Legation in Mexico, continues to report predatory activities on the part of the Mexican authorities. On 17th May they seized 125,000 dollars. Air. Cummings understands that they are preparing for a wholesale plundering of productive industry, to be-exacted in the form of a forced loan. Sir C. Spring Rice, referring to the impossible situation created by the Mexican Governments policy, observes ;Tlst May) that His Majesty&apos;s Government are obviously7 unable to take any remedial measures on the spot and the United States Government probably could not if they would. For the present they are considering the advisability of purchasing an instalment of good behaviour from Senor Carranza by means of a loan.PANAMA.The British Consul at San Jose has reported to Sir C. Mallet that the Government of Panama have been compelled to take serious steps against German plotters ; several of the most prominent have been arrested and deported to Colon. His Majesty&apos;s Consul anticipates the possibility of a crisis in consequence of these measures and suggests that to prevent it the United States and British Governments should give the Administration their support.HONDURAS.The Republic decreed its severance of relations with Germany on 17th May.UNITED STATES.The Navy Department have expressed grave concern at the British Admiralty&apos;s publication  of the  arrival and  operations  of  the United States  destroyers   at2962-4 d
Queenstown, and the matter lias attracted -considerable attention in the American Press.Discussing the organization of Allied, traffic with the United States by land and sea, Mr. Balfour reports, for the information and consideration of the War Cabinet (18th May), that a general consensus of opinion at Washington supports the principle of an United Control, to be applied to all traffic of the Allies whether on the American continent or on transport from America to Europe. Mr. Balfour, for reasons explained, considers that the proposed single Control should be vested in the Traffic Executive with Captain Guthrie as Chairman, rather than in the Munitions of War Organization in New York ; the French Mission endorse this recommendation and the Italians are also likely to concur.In view of the impending visit to England of a Danish deputation to negotiate on commercial, agricultural and shipping questions, and in order to assist His Majesty&apos;s Government in framing this policy for and during- these negotiations, Sir C. Spring Bice has been instructed to ascertain if possible to what extent the United States Government are prepared to restrict the export of staple commodities to neutral countries as a means of bringing united pressure to bear through them upon the enemy.TTHE SHIPPING situation with reference to the impending visit to London of Mr. Andersen and other Danish commercial and shipping delegates, the Foreign Office have informed Sir B. Paget that the chief object of His Majesty&apos;s Government in these negotiations will be to secure that no Danish vessels shall remain laid up in Danish ports, and that all tonnage over and above the amount actually required for Denmark&apos;s home trade shall be diverted to Allied services.Two of the British owned vessels flying the Dutch flag, which were referred to in last week&apos;s Report, have now been requisitioned by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the fact was communicated, with the necessary explanation, by Sir W. Towhley to the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs on 17th May. The Minister made no protest and appeared to regard the measure as a justifiable protection of British property.The Germans have seized and taken to a German port three more Danish steamers sailing in ballast from Denmark to load cargoes in the United Kingdom. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest at Berlin.Sir E. Howard considers that, as a measure supplementary to the application of political pressure to induce the Swedish Government to stimulate the resumption of shipping traffic with Great Britain, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be well advised to afford more encouragement than has hitherto been given to those Swedish shipowners who are ready and willing to resume trading. In certain cases which he cites, their advances would appear to have met with discouragement.Seven British, vessels passed out of the Kogrund Channel, and reached Gothenburg on 19th May, under Swedish convoy. On that date 14 Swedish ships had been released from British ports. Greatly concerned at the loss of the three food ships torpedoed by the Germans en route from England,.the Swedish Government requested on the 19th, that four more vessels with cereals might be allowed to proceed at once to Sweden. Sir E. Howard supported this request, expressing the view that compliance would have an excellent effect upon public opinion in Sweden.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.The International Socialist Commission have announced that the-third Zimmerwald Conference will be held at Stockholm in the middle of June, and not, as previously arranged, on the 31st May..Invitations have also been issued (independently, it would appear) by the Russian Socialists for an international gathering to be held in some neutral country unspecified. Finally, the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council have requested the British Government to grant facilities for delegates from the Social Democratic and
&quot;Independent Labour parties to go to Petrograd. The French and Italian Govern-ments have received similar requests. The Foreign Office considers it undesirable that any political mission should go to Russia during the present crisis in that country.In conversation with His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Stockholm, Messrs. Thome, 0&apos;Grady and Sanders (British Labour delegates) expressed the opinion that, from the standpoint of political expediency, it would not be wise for British Socialists to decline to take part in the forthcoming Conference. German agents, at present extremely active in fomenting anti-British sentiments in Russia, would assuredly ascribe their refusal to an organised British policy which desires the war to continue for purely British ends, and the result -would be disastrous to the cause of the Allies.Through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Petrograd, Mr. Lloyd-George has asked M. Thomas for an expression of his opinion as to whether it is desirable or not that British and French Socialists should attend the Conference. The Prime Minister fears that unless the Allied cause is represented, a bad impression may be created in Russia ; it would certainly be believed that the British, French and Italian Govern-ments were afraid to allow their Socialists to speak freely to their Russian Allies ; moreover, from a democratic point of view, the Entente case is exceedingly strong. As regards war aims, the Prime Minister is of opinion that no wide difference separates those of Russia..from those of the Allies. England and France could accept the Russian formula of a peace without annexations or indemnities, and the phraseology by which that formula has been amplified, provided it be understood that nothing therein is intended to imply that the Allies should restore to German or Turkish misrule the populations in Africa or. Mesopotamia which have been rescued therefrom. France must also be entitled to recover the provinces torn from her by German militari s m.According to a Berlin wireless of 22nd. May, the German Government have definitely announced, in reply to a question by Herr Haase, that the Independent Social Democrat Delegates to the Stockholm Conference will be granted, passports for Sweden.Sir E. Howard reports great activity amongst the small extremist minority of the Swedish Socialists. At a congress held by this group on 18th May, a message was sent to the Russian Socialists encouraging them in their struggle against the Liberal bourgeoisie, enemy of the real Social Revolution. The Congress declares that it represents the fundamental cleavage between International-Radical Socialism and Patriotic-Liberal Socialism, and therefore welcomes the Peace Conference initiative of the Workmens&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Council. The latter, however, deny the soft impeach-ment, and have announced that Russia was not represented at the gathering of Swedish extremists.GENERAL.The German authorities have distributed 150 British prisoners (for the most part men of the mercantile marine) over the town of Freiburg as a measure of reprisals and defence against Allied aircraft attacks. The prisoners are reported to be badly in need of food and clothing.The King of Spain has directed his Ambassador in Berlin to make representations to the German Emperor on the subject of the sinking of hospital ships, and in the sense desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government. At the same time he has instructed the Spanish Ambassador in London to seek an audience of His Majesty the King and to suggest that a representative of the Embassy should visit the next hospital ship leaving England in order to be able to refute the German charge that these vessels are used for military purposes.Sir II. Rumbold forwarded on 20th May a suggestion put forward, by Madame Grouitch, at Berne, on behalf of the Serbian Prisoners Relief Fund. She proposed that, to-meet the urgent needs of the large number of Serbian prisoners dependent on the Fund for food, an appeal be made to the Red Cross Society at Washington for the flour and tonnage required. She hopes that if this appeal can be made before the embarkation of the American Expeditionary Force it will be acted upon. Sir H. . Rumbold asks that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington may be instructed in the sense desired.   Telegraphing from Corfu with regard to the same subject on 21st
May, Sir C. des Graz conveys a request from the Serbian Government that His. Majesty&apos;s Government should obtain from the French authorities a monthly advance-of 55 trucks of flour, to be replaced as soon as supplies are received from America. Failing this, the Serbian Government has reason to expect that the prisoners will perish by thousands. The Foreign Office replied (23rd May) that the Food Controller was being consulted, and that every effort would be made to secure the supplies required without delay.In this connection it is of interest to note that, in an appeal addressed to members of the House of Commons (8th May) by the Executive Committee of the Serbian Relief Fund, it is stated that the present grievous plight of the Serbian prisoners in Germany and Austria-Hungary is primarily due to the action of the Entente authorities in preventing the importation into Switzerland of the flour required. The Fund has-been supplying bread to a steadily increasing number of Serbians (now 62,000) since May 1916 ; it is estimated that 750 tons of flour are required every three months to feed that number. The British, French, and Russian Governments have subscribed funds for this purpose, and the British Red Cross have contributed 20,000L, but unless. means can be found to import flour, financial assistance will not relieve the sufferings, of the Serbian prisoners.
