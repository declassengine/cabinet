SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 12.The serious grain crisis in Italy, and the feeling of resentment against the Allies which it lias given rise, is one of those indirect consequences of the submarine campaign upon which the Germans, as has been pointed out in previous Reports, are probably building more hopes than upon the actual starving out of this country. Recent wireless messages have indicated that Germany is concentrating all her efforts on actually cutting off Italian supplies in the Mediterranean, but no doubt German propaganda in Italy is busily explaining that the real cause of the shortage is the fact that all the surplus grain goes to England.With Italian nerves already on. edge over the grain and coal shortage, and over the possibility of a separate peace between Austria and Russia, it is to be feared that anything but a good effect will be produced by the&quot; revival of French activities in Greece, unless it should prove possible for the conference now meeting to bind down the French to leave Greece alone.Greece.The slight improvement in the Greek situation which was noted, last week is, unfortunately, not likely to be maintained. M. RiboPs Government feel that they must do something before the Chamber meets on 24th May to satisfy the clamour for the punishment of King Constantino. As long as French action is confined to the islands, the Greek Government will no doubt content itself with formal protests against the violation of the pledges given by the Allies. But if it extends to Thessaly or any other part&apos;of continental Greece there is danger of real trouble. The Greek Army is no longer in a position where it could possibly threaten the communications between Salonika and Monastir, but it may put up quite sufficient a fight in. its own country to present the Allies once again, as at the beginning of December last, with the alternative of a ridiculous fiasco or a serious military entanglement.German Internal Situation.The great Berlin strike against the reduced bread, ration has led to little more than the usual peaceful parade of protest and work has, apparently, been resumed everywhere. All the same, indications of restlessness among the German working classes are increasing.Sweden.The anxiety of the new Swedish Government to make an agreement with us is sufficiently explained by the fact that the Swedish bread ration is now down, to barely over 3 lb. a week, or half a pound Jess than the reduced ration against which the Berlin workmen have just been striking.Spain./The Spanish situation is obscure in the,extreme.. At one moment it almost looked as if Spain were definitely going to range herself on the side of the Allies, but Count Romanones seems to have hesitated since and to have postponed any discussion. Spanish anxiety to secure Tangier or some other substantial compensation, and to receive definite offers before taking any irrevocable step, may account, in part, for these hesitations.
China.It would appear that, if,correctly stated, the assurance given by Lord Grey to the Marquis Inouye recognising JapaiPs right hereafter to negotiate with China in regard to the disposition of &quot; any of the Concessions enjoyed by Germany in China &quot; justifies Japan in claiming the reversion not only of the northern section of the Tientsin-Pukou line bat also the German section of the Szchuen Railway. To contest that claim on the ground that the word &quot; Concessions &quot; was used in a technical or restricted sense would assuredly be construed by Japan as bad faith, and create a very bad impression of our diplomatic methods. Inasmuch, however, as the assurance given b37Lord Grey Avas given independently and is not binding upon other Powers concerned, it should be within the resources of diplomacy to arrive at a more satisfactory solution of the problem when the time conies for discussing the general ,readjustment of affairs in China. The entry of the United States into the war obviously affects the whole question; the American Government, are ..directly .concerned,. for instance, in the Szchuen Railway and are not likely to agree to the acquisition of the German interest in that line by Japan.Peace Discussions.The peace manoeuvres of German and Austrian Socialists are pretty obviously directed by their Governments. More dangerous, perhaps, are the activities of Russian extremists, such as Lenin, whose journeys from Switzerland to Russia are being facilitated by the German authorities.L. S. A.10th April 1917.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.The secretary  of State has telegraphed to Australia the text of a Resolution of the Imperial War Conference passed on 14-th April dealing with the provision and care of soldiers&apos; graves. -This Resolution, after stating that the Conference concurred in the proposals made by the Prince of Wales, prayed His Majesty to constitute by Royal Charter an Imperial War Graves Commission. It further expressed appreciation of the action of the French Government in allotting in perpetuity the land where the men of the British Empire are buried, and urged that arrangements should be made, if possible in the terms of peace, with allied, enemy, or neutral Governments, for a similar concession in Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, Africa, and other theatres of war. The satisfaction of the Conference regarding the consent of the Prince of Wales to become the President of the permanent Commission was also recorded.. CANADA.AVith reference to previous telegrams regarding the exportation of wool from. Australia and New Zealand, the Secretary of State has telegraphed to the Canadian Government that the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments have been informed as to the quantities for Canada. It is suggested that the Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce should telegraph to his representatives in A.australia and New Zealand information concerning the orders from Canadian firms which have received Government approval. The representatives would then choose the wool in co-operation with the Government Wool-Committees of the two countries, who have been requested to accord all facilities. The wool bought before the embargo will be entirely controlled by the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments, but they have been asked to render all assistance possible in. respect of shipping, and the War Office has telegraphed to New Zealand asking that 1,279 bales of this wool may be released.The Secretary of State telegraphed on 1.1th April offering his. heartiest congratulations-tious on the brilliant feat of the Canadians in capturing Vimy Ridge. The Governor-General in returning thanks referred to the pride felt by the Government and people of Canada in the splendid achievement.In reply to the request of the French Government, the Dominion Government have agreed to afford protection, by means of patrol vessels in the Cabot Straits, to the Dominion approaches to the landing places of the cables at St. Pierre and Miquelon. The Canadian Government expect the French to provide for the protection of the buildings on shore.NEWFOUNDLAND.With reference to previous telegrams on the subject, the Governor reports that four forestry companies, each consisting of 100 expert woodsmen, can probably be raised, and also one company of miners and one company of railway men. If a transport could be sent to St. John&apos;s, 500 men would be ready to sail by the middle of May.&apos;AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.In asking for authority to enable the Commonwealth to lend the States 3,000,OOOL from the money lent by the British Government for war purposes, the Governor-General further points out that the loan of 3,500,000L, now being raised in London, has been already advanced to the States from the War Loan and has to be returned to that source. The States urgently require the money and Ministers express confidence that the advance of 3,000,000Z. will be agreed to by the British Treasury.The Commonwealth Government have telegraphed that on account of the sale of wheat the amount of 11,000,000Z. advanced by the British Government has come back to the Australian authorities. Considerable sums which are available for war purposes are standing to the credit of the Commonwealth, but are not wanted at the moment.    For example, on  1st May there will be something like
9,000,000Z. to Australia^ credit in London, and it is not expected that the expenditure will be at a greater rate than 2,000,000Z. per month. The Common-wealth Government therefore suggest that the British authorities should take the&apos; above-mentioned 9,000,000?. on 1st May as a temporary repayment of war loans, and should repay the amount to Australia in amounts of not less than 100,000L at 24 hours&apos; notice.The Queensland Government have asked that the&quot; Army Council may give such assistance as may be possible to permit of their soldiers voting in the-Referendum upon the proposed abolition of the Upper House in that State.The Governor-General has asked for an early intimation from the British Government that the skilled workers now being recruited in Australia will not be-made liable for active service on reaching the United Kingdom.The Hon. W. A. Holman, Premier of New South Wales, is coming to England.NEW ZEALAND.The Governor has informed the Secretary of State that the second half of the 23rd reinforcement to the New Zealand Division left the Dominion on 3rd April, and: consisted of 40 officers, 1,124- men, and 4- nurses, while the first half of the 24th rein-forcement left on 6th April and consisted of 20 officers, 928 men, and 2 nurses.A telegram from the Governor states that there are 11,490 troops now training in the Dominion, including 198 Maories. There, are 1,919 voluntary recruits not yet called up for training. Since the last announcement on the subject, voluntary recruiting has not improved.SOUTH AFRICA.In continuation of figures relating to the number of troops supplied for the South African contingents,&apos;3 the following information has been telegraphed by the Union Government: Contingent.

The Union Government have been asked, however, to state the amount, exported to Japan as this affects the quantity to be sent from elsewhere. It is suggested that sailing ships&apos; might be utilised for the shipment.In response to the suggestion of the Chamber of Mines^ the British Government have expressed their opinion that the production of gold from British territory, and the maintenance of the output, is of the greatest Imperial importance.The Union Government estimate that there are about 120 Jugo Slavs in their territory, 20 of whom have volunteered for service with the Serbian Army. It is proposed to allow these men to serve as they desire, but it has been decided to intern the others.The Secretary of State has telegraphed his heartiest congratulations on the gallant part taken by the South African troops in the recent fighting, by means of which they have added to their glorious record at Delville Wood.* See &quot;Western and General Beport for week ending 14th March.f Sec Western and General Report for -week ending 28th March 1917.
77SOUTH-WEST AFRICA. 1TIOTECTORATE.The report of the Administrator of the-South-West Africa Protectorate (formerly German South-West Africa) has been issued as a Parliamentary paper by the Union Government. From extracts telegraphed to the Press it appears that the Admini-strator denies that he has met with unsubmissiveness from the German population. The reports from the Magistrates of 18 districts all emphasise the lawabidingness of the population, and some reports note that, with few exceptions, the enemy subjects have given little or no trouble.The Administrator observes that the country is one of great possibilities, especially for ranching purposes, and would repay the attention of the leading stock farmers of the Union.PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.The High Commissioner for South Africa telegraphs that the native revolt which recently broke out in Portuguese East Africa is spreading westwards towards Zumbo and southwards towards the Beira Railway, it is expected that the Portuguese may ask for Rhodesian help in order to protect the lines of communication. In. this event, and subject to the Administrator considering that the assistance is essential, it is proposed to -send an armoured train with 50 men to patrol the line, and also a force of 125 Europeans. The High Commissioner considers that help should only be given to keep open railway communication with Beira and to protect Europeans, as further measures would lead the natives to conclude that the British were assisting the Portuguese to support their system of administration.In reply to the suggestion made to that effect, the Portuguese authorities cannot agree to the recruiting of carriers north of latitude 22c, as the Portuguese have themselves difficulty in getting labour. The Governor-General can only permit the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association to recruit for the mines.EAST AFRICA  PROTECTORATE.Owing to the shortage of Europeans through enlistment, the Officer Administering the Government proposes to make it an offence for Europeans or Asiatics in civil employment to leave that employment without the consent of the employer. It would be proposed to give a right of appeal to the District Committee and thence to the War Council.NIGERIA:The Governor-General has informed the Secretary of State that he will eudeavour to supply 2,000 carriers for East Africa during the first month and 1,000 per month for the four following months. These will be irrespective of the 2,000 which are being transported by the &quot; Persic &quot; from Sierra Leone.GOLD COAST.The Governor reports that there are 1,281 recruits and partially-trained men (exclusive of garrison, &amp;c.) in ihe Colony, and that 500 of these are ready to be transported overseas at once by the &quot; City of Sparta.&quot;2S42-3 B. BASUTOLAND.    , .It lias been decided that 20 aeroplanes &quot;shall be purchased with the gift of money sent by the Basuto. Half of these will be presented to the Royal Naval Air Service and half to the Royal Flying Corps. In conveying the thanks of the Air Board to the Paramount Chief it has been suggested that the aeroplanes should bear the names of chiefs or towns to connect them with Basutoland.
BRITISH HONDURAS.In order to prepare for a possible raid being-organised by Germany from Mexico, the Officer Administering the Government df British Honduras has raised the territorial force by voluntary recruiting during the week ending 7th April, from 230 men to 150. lie has hinted at the possibility of compulsion if the men do not come forward satisfactorily, lie reports further, that he has only two maxim guns and no field guns, and that there is a great deficiency in small arms. Improvements are being made in the wireless station.PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ITALY.: The Minister for Foreign Affairs has drawn the attention of His Majesty&apos;? Ambassador to the gravity of the situation brought about by.the shortage of grain in Italy7, also to the fact that tonnage allocated, to the supply of Italy&apos;s needs has been and is being diverted to other purposes. At a Cabinet Meeting held in. Rome on the 12th. April, six Ministers, after learning the facts of the situation, threatened to resign; there is much excitement in official circles, where the assumption prevails that Italy is being asked to make sacrifices greater than those of her Allies.BELGIUM.Sir Yv. Townley reports that both the French and the Belgian Minister at The Hague foresee great difficulties in securing the smooth working of the reorganisation scheme for the Relief Commission^ work suggested by His Majesty&apos;s Government (vide last Report). The matter of the proposed appointment of Spanish and Dutch joint-Chairmen is complicated from the outset by the idiosyucracies and jealousies of the Spanish Minister at Brussels on the one hand and on the other by the fact that the Dutch Chairman appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is regarded as unsuitable by the French and Belgian representatives. The Germans also refuse to recognise him or to grant him passports, on the ground that his sympathies are with the Allies: they are taking advantage of the present situation to accept only such Dutchmen as they know to be pro-German, and have sent back two out of the five delegates sent to replace the Americans. In the meanwhile all sailings of relief ships have been suspended by the Commission as the result of Germany&apos;s evident intention to sink them.GREECE.Having reference to the recent conversation between M. Ilibot and the Brime Minister at Folkestone, His Majesty&apos;s Government instructed Lord Bertie on the .13thiApril to convey to the French Government an expression of their earnest hope that orders may be given to General Sarrail that he should take no military action against Greece, either at.Larissa or elsewhere, pending the conference with Baron Sonnino proposed by M. Ribot. At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador was directed to express the great regret of the War Cabinet on being informed that General Sarrail had again postponed his attack on the Bulgarian army until 25th April. Lord Bertie&apos;s reply of the 11th reported that orders in the sense desired had been conveyed to General Sarrail.Amidst the multitude of councillors and the confusion of opinions which appear to offer insuperable obstacles to concerted action by the Allies in Greece, it is difficult to gauge French policy with any degree of accuracy, or to determine how far General SarraiLs proceedings represent his personal and independent initiative. A fair idea of the chaotic conditions prevailing is afforded by the following resume of official reports received during the past week: On the 12th April the Foreign Office informed Sir F. Elliot, on. the authority of the French Ambassador, that General Sarrail. and the French Admiral had been instructed secretly to prepare measures for the protection, in case of need, of the lives of Venizelists and of Allied nationals.
Sir F. Elliots reply expressed the opinion, that the only measure of protection which, the French naval authorities could provide would be &quot; to bombard us.&quot; He added that, although the situation had become less strained, the impression was prevalent both in French and Greek circles that &quot; something was going to happen shortly.&quot; On the 12th the S.S. Esperla arrived at Athens from Salonika with naval and military officials on board, ostensibly a depot ship for Venizelist recruits, but believed, to be -contemplating an occupation of Salamis Island under French auspices. &quot; To avoid misunderstandings &quot; the French Vice-Adiniral ordered her to Syva on the I-1th. On that day Sir F. Elliot reported that M. Venizelos had. informed the Prelect of Syra that the French Government were modifying their. attitude and were about to withdraw their guarantees for the maintenance of the status quo. In conversation with Lord Granville on the 17th, M. Venizelos sensibly modified this statement, alleging a misunderstanding on the part of his representative in Paris. He had been categorically informed by the French that he could not extend into Thessaly. But the proceedings of the French authorities in the islands of Corfu and Cephalonia were of a nature to lend colour to the report. On the 14th the Prime Minister complained to Sir F. Elliot that the Royalist authorities at Cephalonia had been removed by the French and replaced, by Venizelists ; three days before the Chief of Police and other persons had been similarly expelled from Corfu. He observed that these occurrences constituted violations of the solemn engagements of the Allied Powers. The Greek&quot; Government had previously entered a formal, protest against the removal of the Royalist authorities at Zante and asked for their re-instatement. Lord Bertie reports that the French. Government intend to adhere firmly to the attitude which they have adopted in this question.On the 15th Sir F. Elliot was informed, by the British Naval authorities that the islands of Skopelos and Khelidromi had declared their independence, and imprisoned 23 Royalists and Police. The islands are in urgent need, of flour, the (lovernment at Athens having stopped latest consignments. The British Admiral proposes to treat these islands on the same lines as Cerigo, but Lord (iranville considers the procedure adopted, at Zante to be more suitable to the circumstances. The Control Officer at Cerigo reported on the .17th that Venizelist troops had landed there on. the previous night and taken possession. Sir F. Elliot, in forwarding this report, enquired whether this action was taken with tire connivance of the French and the knowledge of His Majesty&apos;s Government.On the 17th Sir F. Elliot reported the recurrence of alarming rumours, which he regards as the natural result of the indiscretion of French officers and others who talk of an impending occupation, of Thessaly and the dethronement of the King. His Majesty&apos;s Minister urges the imperative necessity of coming to a definite understanding with the French Government in regard to their policy, with, a view to united action in. Greece, tie assumes that His Majesty V Government desire to maintain the Greek dynasty, but if it be decided to co-operate with the French for its remoA&apos;al, he considers that this should be done openly and deliberately. The King, he believes, has been so frightened by the revolution in Russia that he might be willing to come to terms with the Entente, provided that the Powers&apos; demands were clearly stated, and that the King could, feel that their word would be kept when given.The Italian Minister at Athens has initiated steps, approved by Sir F. Elliot and his Russian colleague, to remedy the anomalous and possibly dangerous position created by the French claim to exercise supremo authority on. the Military Control Commission. lie takes exception to General Chuboue&apos;s corresponding with the Prime Minister, instead of with the Greek General Staff ; also to the fact that this correspondence deals with matters of a political nature and is conducted without consulting the representatives of the Allied Powers. The British Government have addressed the French. Government in regard, to the re-establish ment of the Allied Controls and expressed the hope that they may agree to accept the original scheme as proposed by the Allied Commission.M. Venizelos informed Lord Granville on the 14th. that although certain financial details remain to be settled between the British Treasury and the French Ministry of Finance, he has received assurances which justify,him in proceeding with mobilisation in the islands, and will therefore commence doing so on 18th April, He hopes that his proposal to employ the Cretan Division on the british front may be accepted. With regard, to his proposed mobilisation, Sir F. Elliot has suggested to Lord Granville that M. Venizelos should reconsider the question, if possible, on the ground
that in some of the islands which adhered to the national movement, assurances were-given that there would be no conscription.The Minister for Foreign Affairs at Salonika has communicated to Ford. Granville a report, which originated, with the Russian Minister at&apos;Athens, that Xing Constantine-&apos;is being.urged by certain quarters to effect a reconciliation with M. Venizelos and &apos; that the King is favourably disposed. The Minister for Foreign Affairs regards this report as a ruse to put M. Venizelos in the wrong, as in his opinion such a reconcilia-tion is now quite impossible and would never be permitted by M. Venizelos&apos;s followers; there could be no compromise between autocratic and democratic govern-ment in Greece.The problem of provisioning Greece has been aggravated by the sinking of two-wheat steamers by submarines. The Greek Government have thereby been led to-request that London underwriters may be authorised to insure Greek grain ships, and, pending arrangement of the matter, the National Rank has telegraphed to America - suspending all further, loading and sailing of these vessels. One of the torpedoed ships, the &quot;Nestos,&quot; was under requisition by the Greek Government and. presumably under German safe conduct. Sir F. Elliot has therefore been instructed to let it be generally known that Germany&apos;s submarine campaign is deliberately contributing to the starvation of Greece.Sir R. Wingate reports that 80 per cent, of the entire Greek colony in Egypt have-inscribed themselves as Venizelists. Under these circumstances he expresses the hope that the commander-iii-Chief may be authorised to give effect to the request of the Provisional Governments representative and. transfer to the Venizelist Consular authorities the Greek Consular Archives, subject to provision, of proper facilities of access thereto for Royalists.The Military Control Officer at Janina reported on 12th April that Italian troops had occupied the line of the Kalamas river.The Minister for Foreign Affairs at Salonika has complained to Lord Granville-(13th April) of the irregular and arbitrary proceedings of the Italian authorities in Corfu. He attributes them in great measure to the peace-at-any-pr.ice attitude of the French Military Governor and urges that the latter should have a stronger force to-support his authority, and more especially that a British force should, be sent there in order &quot; to show our interest and the solidarity of the Allies.&quot;GERMAN  INTERNAL AFFAIRS.A wireless message from Berlin to the Hearst Press in New York declares that Germany will not accept the challenge of America&apos;s declaration of hostilities or recognise the existence of a state of war. The correspondent (Wiegandj observes that this will create an unprecedented situation.The German Government are no doubt reluctant to lose all the German-American correspondents, whose docile services have for so long been unreservedly employed in the dissemination of German propaganda in the United States, for the same corre-correspondent reports : &quot;Americans are being well treated and are continuing business. &quot; So far I. have had no complaints. Some are preparing to depart. The General &quot; Staff has given permission to seven American correspondents to leave, but they are &quot; holding George T. O&apos;Del.1 and. myself (representing the &apos; Evening Mail&apos; and the &quot; &apos; International &apos;) to the conditions expressly accepted upon our recent entrance into &quot; Germany, viz., that we should remain for three months. They hold that having &quot; given our word to this arrangement, it must be fulfilled until its expiry in June. &quot; We shall be permitted to live in a hotel, and not, interned. As German)&apos; does &quot; not recognise the existence of a state of war, we have been, informed that we &quot; may continue to send dispatches as long as we remain, if American papers have any &quot; further interest in news from Germany.&quot; Two days later M. Wiegand telegraphed, to the &quot; New York American &quot; that &quot;in view of the reported wholesale arrests and &quot; maltreatment of Germans in America, it is doubtful whether Americans will be &quot; allowed to leave Germany.&quot; &apos;On the same day-one of the seven Correspondents who had received permission to leave, telegraphed that &quot; owing to the Easter holidays, the departure of American &quot; newspaper correspondents is somewhat delayed, but it is fully believed that the &quot; necessary permission will be granted.&quot; , Meanwhile he and others continue to avail themselves of the privilege of telegraphing official German news and views to the United States.   Describing an Easter holiday crowd in the Thiergarten andUnter den.
Linden; Wiegand comments on the &quot; calm and peaceful atmosphere which contrasts so . &quot; strangely with the war excitement reported in America.&quot; There was a complete absence of talk about the war and little or no mention of the United States. &quot;The &quot; satisfaction at getting a few contraband Easter eggs at 20 cents each, or at a good &quot; dinner in prospect or already enjoyed, evoked a livelier interest than America&apos;s -&quot; entrance into the war. The people on the whole have grown slimmer and thinner. &quot; Beer-bellies have mostly disappeared, but on the whole the appearance of the lower &quot; classes is much better than I had expected. The operas and theatres were never &quot; more crowded. Compared with the outside world, from which I recently came, &quot; Germany is like another sphere, whose inhabitants have lost all mental touch with. &quot; those wiio dwell beyond their frontiers.&quot;The New York &quot; Evening Mail &quot; received a message from Mr. 0&apos;Dell in almost identical terms, embellished, however, by the statement that &quot;the successful issue of &quot; the battle at Arras had brought feelings of relief to the German people.&quot;German agents in Switzerland, are endeavouring to purchase all available stocks of. genuine Japanese paper, it being particularly suitable for the manufacture of explosives.According to a German wireless message to the &quot; New York American,&quot; the reduction of the bread allowance in Germany, which took effect on the .16th, lowered the ration, from 1,900 to 1,600 grammes per week. Despite the official assurance that the reduction would be offset by increased allowances of potatoes, meat and cereals, there was a certain amount of discontent, which was expected to manifest itself in the usual form of peaceful parades of protest. (It is of interest to note that the Swedish bread ration has been reduced to 1,400 grammes weekly.) A Wolff Bureau telegram of the 17th, announced that a strike of the metal, wood and transport trades had been declared in Berlin, but that it was not considered to be of much importance.AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.Austrian interests in Great Britain and the Dominions and in the United States have now been entrusted to the care of the Swedish Government.Reference to the recent activities of the Austrian Socialist leaders will be found under the heading of &quot;Peace Discussions.&quot;HOLLAND.The Prime Ministers speech during the Budget Debate in. the First Chamber on .1.2th April laid stress on the fact that the ueutraPs lot is not a happy one. Holland, he said, was being gravely injured by the submarine warfare in respect of her imports and industries ; she was also suffering severely from the effects of the British blockade. Nevertheless she would continue steadfast in her policy of strict and lawful neutrality, prepared to defend her territories against all comers. Pier-dangerous isolation may become intensified, but in persevering in the path which she believes to be just and right, she hopes to retain something more valuable than the transient approval of one or other of the belligerents, namely, their genuine respect both now and after the war.A report forwarded by Sir W. Townley states that negotiations are afoot, initiated by the Dutch Minister of Finance, for the creation of one central Government administration to control the, entire traffic in foodstuffs, import, export and home consumption. It is feared that this scheme may be carried out under auspices and conditions which would bring about the retirement of the individuals who have hitherto worked loyally to carry out the obligations incurred by Holland under the agricultural&apos;agreement with England, and that the net result of the change would be at the expense of the smooth working of that agreement. The proposed concentration of control is opposed by the Minister of Agriculture.SWEDEN.The effect of the Russian revolution on the Swedish army and working classes is manifested in many symptoms of unrest, to which the increasing scarcity of food supplies is a contributing factor. Sir E. Howard reports that officers in the army have been instructed &quot;to relax their rigorous Prussian-system discipline ; there are2842-3 O :
rumours of impending disturbances on Labour Day.   A communique of the Economics; -Commission to the Press (loth April) anticipates a deficit of about 200,000 tons of cereals between now and next harvest.    Bread rations  have been  reduced   by one-fifth.On 14th April His Majesty&apos;s Minister telegraphed the details, under six headings, of the agreement which the Swedish Government are prepared to make with Great Britain in settlement of the questions outstanding. Broadly stated, this agreement provides for the release of 37 Swedish ships (19 loaded with grain) now detained in British ports, in return for which Sweden will agree to the gradual passage of British and Allied shipping from the Baltic through the Kogrund passage, carrying cargoes of sawn timber. (Certain subsidiary arrangements, bearing on the resumption of Anglo-Swedish traffic and the North Sea regulations, are dealt with under the heading of &quot; German Submarine Campaign.&quot;) The Swedish Government will also grant reasonable facilities for transit to Russia. The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked that the terms of this draft agreement, and particularly its provisions in regard to the importation of goods destined for Russia, shall be treated as secret.NORWAY.The -President of the National Coal Association has informed Sir M. Findlay that&apos; Norway&apos;s stock of foundry coke is only sufficient for two months, and that none can be obtained from Germany except for factories fulfilling German orders. The country^ recpurements amount to 60,000 tons a year. If it is not possible to obtain supplies from the United Kingdom, the Association desires to make arrangements to obtain them from America. His Majesty&apos;s Minister suggests that this need of factory fuel may serve as leverage to obtain a settlement of the tonnage question (q.v. under German Submarine Campaign).DENMARK.Denmark&apos;s need of coal is urgent and increasing, and with it the readiness of certain members of the Danish Government to make such terms as Germany may require in return for supplies. At present Germany is providing 27,000 tons of Westphaliau coal monthly, which is less than half the normal consumption. The Danish Government have been compelled to send Danish railway trucks to fetch this coal, and this rolling stock is used for general transport purposes between German stations on the southward journey. His M.ajesty&apos;s Minister has been directed to press the Danish. Government for a definite assurance that it is not employed for any military purposes. Sir R. Paget forwards a confidential report (14th April) describing an attempt b)r certain members of the Government to arrange to send a large number of Danish vessels to Rotterdam for German coal ; from the facts of the case it would seem that the policy of the Government, and especially of the Minister of Finance, is becoming more German in its sympathies. The scheme was checked by the direct intervention of the King.After further consideration of the questions raised (vide Report No. 10) by the refusal of certain British, importers to accept consignments of Danish butter, His .Majesty&apos;s Government have informed Sir R. Paget- that the proposal to establish a purchasing agency in Denmark is not practicable, for reasons stated. Steps will be taken, while keeping the trade as far as possible in usual channels, to lend such official support as will enable importers to give the Danish shiprjers an adequate profit. Concerning the large accumulations of Danish butter which remain unsold in England, enquiry has shown that the low price offered by British importers is solely due to the fact that large simultaneous consignments of Colonial and Argentine butter have lowered the market. Commercially, the question, in England is simply one of supply and. demand, but Great Britain&apos;s limitation of the amount of Danish produce which may go to Germany (where higher prices are offered.) justifies the Danes in expecting that it be not so regarded.   .Information from a reliable source goes to show that vessels of the Danish East Asiatic Company have for a long time been engaged in the systematic smuggling of rubber from the Company&apos;s eastern plantations into Denmark. The rubber is made into tyres by the Copenhagen firm of Schinning and Arve ; the tyres are shipped on the company&apos;s eastward bound vessels and transhipped -into German vessels, presumablv in Scandinavian waters.
SPAIN.Before leaving for Spain the Marquis of Cortina was authorised by the Government * -to sign the Anglo-Spanish agreement (vide last Report).On tire 11th April, there were indications in the Madrid Press that a Governmental -crisis was imminent.   On the 12th the Minister for  Foreign   Affairs  informed Mr.&apos; Vaughan (in the absence of Sir A. Hardinge) that the pronouncement by the Argentine Government and the general anti-German attitude of the South American Republics had made a very deep impression on the Spanish Government.   The urgent representations of the United States Ambassador had. also given them cause to consider anxiously the question of Spain&apos;s continuance in neutrality and  of  her  possible isolation.   The pro-German Press and German agents, evidently alarmed, proceeded to create a diversion by suggesting that Sir A. Hardinge had left for England after being mixed up in. a conspiracy to dethrone the King of Spain, and that he and the Russian. Ambassador had instigated the recent Socialist and Labour movement in Madrid.   On the 13th, it seemed probable that  the  Government, led by Count Romauones, would avail themselves of the sinking of the S.S. &quot; San Fulgencio &quot; to declare war against Germany, or at least to break off- relations, a step which His Majesty&apos;s Government would have cordially welcomed.   Count Romanones informed the French Ambassador on that day that it had been decided to address a Note to Germany, protesting against the impossible position in which Spain was placed by the submarine campaign ; he expected it to be followed by a rupture of relations.   At this point, however, restraining influences became apparent in the attitude of Count Romanones. Mr. Vaughan reported on the loth that the Note, originally intended to go by wireless to Berlin, had been toned down and sent by special, messenger; the Governments procrastinating tendencies had possibly  been,  encouraged  by Chile s decision to maintain neutrality, and the German Ambassador had no doubt terrorised the Premier. The Government, in fact, had decided to wait and see.   Ah official communique to the Press emphasised their intention to make no change in their policy of neutrality.Under these delicate circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s representative found it difficult to take vigorous action in regard to the question of the ore ships, several, of which are arbitrarily detained by the Spanish Authorities at Almeria, Bilbao, and Cartagena. On the 12th April, he was directed to inform the Spanish Government that their action in this matter threatens the whole basis of the agreement just concluded ; that if the ships are not allowed to load iron ore, they will be ordered to leave in ballast. The Minister of Finance was not disposed to cancel the restrictive regulation until he had studied the text of the agreement which the Marquis of Cortina was bringing to Madrid. On the 17th. instructions were sent to Mr. Vaughan to press urgently for the release of these vessels and to state that His Majesty&apos;s.Government feel very strongly that, a satisfactory understanding having now been reached by this agreement, the Spanish&apos;Government should place no restrictions on normal trade, pending its ratification.PORTUGAL.In a Note addressed &quot;to Sir L. Carnegie on the 15th April, the Portuguese Government state that Austrian ships cannot be included in their agreement with Great Britain respecting the appropriation of enemy vessels, as Portugal is not at war with Austria. Further, in. reference to this agreement, they request that His Majesty&apos;s. Government may not take too strict a view of their obligations, in. view of the critical situation in. which Portugal finds herself by reason of the scarcity of tonnage for home requirements. The Note concludes with an appeal to the traditional friendship between England and Portugal.CHINA,The Japanese Minister at Peking has informed. Mr. Alston that the Japanese Government agree to the provisional arrangement proposed (vide Report No. 7) for the administration of the Tlentsin-Pukow Railway, namely, that the German personnel of the northern section of the line shall be replaced by the British engineer and staff of the southern section. Their consent to this agreement is, however, accompanied by an intimation that, as they have succeeded to the special position held by the Germans in Shantung, they may hereafter have occasion to claim the reAre.rsion of German rights in this railway, a claim which, in view of the assurances given by His Majesty&apos;s Government, they hope may receive the support of Great Britain.
In this connection, Mr. Alston was informed on the 14th that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-cannot admit any general claim on the part of Japan, based on assurances or otherwise, to succeed to German assets, wheresoever they may be found in. China. The assurances referred to were not intended to cover anything except actual German &quot; concessions,&quot; while that which was recently given in regard, to Shantung was only meant to apply to the actual rights exercised by Germany in that province, which will need hereafter to be clearly defined. A Japanese claim to that section of the Tientsi n-Pukow hallway which runs through Shantung might be admitted, but arrangements for the ultimate disposal of German assets elsewhere in China must await the final peace settlement; arrangements made during the war are necessarily provisional. Mr. Alston was instructed, in his discretion and should occasion arise, to make a general statement in. this sense to the Japanese Minister.On the 17th, to prevent risk of misunderstanding, His Majesty&apos;s Minister telegraphed the text of the Japanese Ministers communication, of the 7th. and his. own reply. Hie correspondence shows that the Japanese Governments general claim is based on the assurance given by Lord Grey to the Marquis Inouye on the 1st January 1916 and confirmed on the 4th February, namely, &quot; that if Germany is &quot; defeated and when the terms of peace come to be arranged, the British Government &quot; have no intention to acquire any of the concessions enjoyed by Germany in China &quot; and. will therefore raise no objection to Japan&apos;s negotiating with China as to the &quot; final disposition of such concessions.&quot;The total number of coolies to be recruited in China, to meet the labour battalion requirements of the War Office, has been fixed at 35,000. Mr. Alston reports that-owing to the spread of rumours concerning the dangers run by coolie transports, great difficulty is being experienced in obtaining the interpreters and other personnel required to accompany the last contingent of 10,000 recruits. Unless these rumours can be contradicted at once, he fears this difficulty may be insuperable.The political situation, at Peking, and the Chinese Governments attitude towards Germany, continue undecided. On the 15th, Mr., Alston reported that although the Premier is still in favour of China joining the Allies, the Government are afraid to take the plunge until assured that they are in. a j)ositi.on to control any local disturbances that may occur in the provinces, A conference of the high Militaiy Authorities has been, summoned to meet this week at Peking. America&apos;s entry into the war, combined with the fact that the American legation is again, pressing China to follow the United States&apos; lead, has brought the anti-Japanese party to the front and enables tire Chinese Government to pursue their traditional policy of playing off one Power against the other.JAPAN.Referring to the Japanese Governments intimation of their desire to acquire all or some of the enemy ships in Chinese ports, the Foreign Office has instructed Sir O. Greene to point out that the offer of purchase conveyed by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Chinese Authorities was made with, the object of providing them quickly with all possible inducements to sever relations with Germany. As regards the future allocation of these vessels, the Japanese Government can hardly fail to recognise the special position in which His Majesty&apos;s Government are placed by having to provide the bulk of the tonnage employed for the purposes of the war and by bearing the brunt of the losses resulting from the submarine campaign. This special position, it is hoped, will be recognised by the Japanese Government and lead them, to admit that, so long as the present conditions last, Great Britain is entitled to a first claim on fresh acquisitions of tonnage.ARGENTINA.The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir R. Tower on 16th April that investigation shows the Republics margin of wheat to be so small that it will not be possible to comply with His Majesty&apos;s Governments request for the exportation of 190,000 tons. The Argentine Government, desirous of doing their utmost to meet Great Britain&apos;?, needs, propose that some portion of the stock purchased by His Majesty&apos;s Government be taken in the form of flour ; they will make definite proposals as soon as possible.   The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed much gratification at
1381the British Governments proposal to replace Argentine supplies in due course by &apos; Australian wheat.The publication of the Argentine Governments Note of cordial sympathy to the United States (11th April) was received with the utmost satisfaction by the people of Buenos A:re-. Their Anti-German sentiments were subsequently increased by the news of the sinking of an Argentine vessel. Demonstrations in favour of the Allies took place and some damage was done to German property.On the loth April, the Argentine Republic sent a message of sincere fraternal sentiment to Brazil. On the same day, Sir 0. Spring Rice learned at Washington that the Argentine Government had proposed to Chile a conference of neutrals, an announcement which, in his opinion, was calculated to surprise the State Department. On the 18th lie reported that the United States Government had notified the Argentine of their intention to be represented at the proposed Conference. He added that neither the Argentine nor Chile is prepared to sign the Pan-American Agreement. Brazil is willing to do so.BRAZIL.The German Minister to Brazil was handed his passport on the 11th. No arrangements having then been made as to the taking over of German interests, he expressed the wish to remain until the 18th. The Brazilian Government have placed a Brazilian Lloyd steamer at his disposal to convey him and his Consular Staff to Christiania, and a safe-conduct has been issued, under conditions laid clown by the British and French Governments.Armed guards have been placed on. board the German ships lying in Brazilian ports. This measure, reluctantly consented to by the President of the Republic, is officially stated not to imply the seizure of the vessels. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir A. Peel that the President is strongly opposed to requisitioning the German vessels, and that he has assured the German Minister that they will not be seized.   All the ships have been very seriously7 damaged,CHILE.The Chilean Government, while]informing the German Minister at Santiago of their desire to remain neutral, have intimated that they expect in return that Germany7 will refrain from submarine activities off the Chilean coast and from interfering with the nitrate trade.PERU.Public opinion at, Lima and the Peruvian Press in general, approve the non-committal tenour of the note sent by7 the Peruvian Government in reply7 to the United States&apos; announcement of a state of war with Germany.BOLIVIA.The Republics relations with Germany were broken off at 6 p.m. on the 13th April.URUGUAY.The Government of the Republic have sent a telegram congratulating the United States on their decision to uphold the principles of international law. The Foreign Minister has informed Mr. Mitchell limes that Uruguay stands so greatly in fear of an armed invasion of her frontiers by the Germans in Southern Brazil that it is not possible for her to declare war against Germany7. His Majesty&apos;s Minister enquires whether arms and ammunition could be supplied to the Uruguayan Government, if required.MEXICO.The Mexican Government^ reply to the United States Ambassador^ notification of a state of war with Germany expresses regret that the United States should have2842-3 D
been unable to avoid hostilities, and, referring to Senor Carranza&apos;s peace note of 12th February, adds that Mexico will take all possible steps to shorten the war. On the 14th instant Mr. Thurstan reported that, in view of the weakness of his position, the President might leave the question of Mexico&apos;s neutrality to be decided by the new Congress, in which the -military party is expected to have a large majority.On 13th April Sir 0. Spring Pice forwarded a report from Lord Cowdray&apos;s representative to the effect that the Mexican Government, in pursuance of their pro-German policy, were preparing to seize the Tehuantepoc Railway and to prohibit the&quot; export of petroleum on grounds of neutrality. This report suggested, as a means of inducing the Mexican Government to abandon these intentions, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should lodge a strong protest against their recent seizure of the Mexican Railway. Mr. Thtirstan, telegraphing on the lGtli, endorsed this proposal ; it was, however, opposed by the Board of the Mexican Railway Company in London.According to confidential information communicated to Sir C. Spring Rice, the . United States Military Authorities have completed plans for immediate military action in the event of any attempt being made upon the Mexican oil-helds. In the opinion of Lord Cowdray (telegraphed by the Foreign Office to the Ambassador at Washington on the 14th), the military and political objections to such action have probably been under-estimated in the United States. Lord. Cowdray considers it preferable that Carranza should be allowed, if he so wills, to assume control peaceably over the oil-fields, as this will involve less risk of their destruction, and that the status quo should be maintained as long as possible. Telegraphing on the 18th, Sir C. Spring Rice reported that the Secretary of State had informed him that the United States Government would be very reluctant to take any aggressive action in regard to the oil-fields, as it would justify the Mexicans in attacking American, territory; therefore no immediate action on land was probable. Mr. Thurstan considers that to allow the Mexican Governments troops to take possession of the oil-fields would be a fatal error. In his opinion, the best way of protecting them would be to support Pelaez against Carranza with men, money, and arms from the United States. This must be done thoroughly or not at all and would, he admits, definitely involve the American Government in the necessity of ousting the present regime in Mexico.Congress was opened by President Carranza on the 16th April. In the course of his speech he declared that the Mexican Governments only outstanding diplomatic difficulty was with His Majesty&apos;s Government over the &quot;Oregon&quot; and &quot; Leonor&quot; incident. He announced the seizure of the Mexican Railway ami his intention to seize the Tehuantepec, Alvaredo, and Vera Cruz lines. In view of this deliberate attack on British rights and interests, Mr. Thurstan asks that he be authorised to demand the restitution of the Mexican Railway and an assurance in regard to the other lines, and, failing these, to request his passports. Under existing circumstances, he considers that Great Britain&apos;s position would be improved by the severance of diplomatic relations. At present the Legation is merely an instrument for the recording of protests and our prestige a vanishing quantity.CUBA.His Majesty!s representative at Havana was directed to convey to the President of the Republic an expression of the warm appreciation with which His Majesty the King and the-British Government welcome the adhesion of Cuba to the nations who tire fighting for liberty. The President in reply (13th April) expressed his gratification and declared the intention of the Cuban Government to-do all in their power to assist the cause of the Allies.Mr. Leech has been instructed (1.4th April) to point out unofficially to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty a Government have evidence that the Cuban Consul-General-at Rotterdam has been forwarding to German firms business letters which appear to reach him through the Cuban State Department.PANAMA.The Coirimander-ih-Chifef of the United States Military Potces in the Canal zone has been placed in supreme control of civil and military affairs. Additional warships have been detailed to guard the Canal. All enemy subjects in the Republic have been interned on Taboga Island.
COLUMBIA.Sir C. Mallet (Panama)&apos;transmitted, on the 13th, information received from an American destroyer off Puerto Colombia to the effect that a Mr. Haines (said to be a disloyal Irishman) has purchased, and is hastily equipping, two Colombian coast-guard vessels. Seventy-four Germans, including engineers and three officers, are assisting him. His movements are regarded with suspicion by the United States authorities. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Bogota has been directed to draw the serious attention of the Colombian Government to the provisions of the Plague Convention respecting the fitting out of vessels for belligerent purposes.COSTA RICA.On. 13th April Sir C. Malic; was informed by the Costa Rican Minister for Foreign. Affairs that Don Federico Tinoco had assumed office as President of the Republic; that he has every sympathy with Great Britain&apos;s noble cause and hopes to cultivate close and cordial relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government. Sir C. Mallet considers that it would be greatly to our interest if President T:inoco&apos;s Government were now recognised, as his election has met with universal approval in Costa Rica. Sir C. Spring Rice has been directed to suggest simultaneous recognition by the American and British Governments. The Costa Rican Government have offered the use of. their ports and waters for the purposes of the United States Navy.PIAYTI.Mr. Kohan (Port-au-Prince) reported on the 16th that the Republic of Playti would declare war against Germany on 18th April.UNITED STATES.The United States Government have taken possession of all Austrian ships and are considering their course of action in regard to them.With a view to securing united and concerted action, Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed, to propose to the United States Government that they should institute for American vessels a system of licensing voyages, similar to that carried out in Great Britain under the direction of the Shipping Controller. So soon as this system for controlling the movements of vessels has been set up, facilities similar to those given to British ships will be given at all bunkering stations to American ships. As regards bunker control, His Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer, unless the United States Government see objections, that their action should take the line of prohibiting the export of coal and of adopting the Ships&apos; White and Black Lists, &amp;c, which, after long experience, enable the British authorities to make their control effective, and which, if the United States Government so desire, will be placed at their disposal.A Press message from New York on 11th April, suppressed by the British Censorship, announced that the United States Government would send a mission to attend the Conference of the Allies at Paris in May ; also that, after the Conference,&apos; a French mission would visit the United States. The Foreign Office have instructed. Sir 0, Spring Rice to represent to the United States Government the dangers involved in the publication of information concerning journeys by sea of important personages.A special mission from France to the United States is leaving very shortly. It includes M. Yiviani (Minister of Justice), Field-Marshal Joffre, Vice-Admiral Chocheprat and the Marquis de Chanbrun, Deputy of the Centre.Mr. Gompers, head of the American Labour Unions, is anxious that representatives of British and French labour should go to the United States, He is in communication with Russia, at the request of the United States Government. Strong appeals to the Jews in Russia have been sent by powerful groups of their co-religionists in the United States.GERMAN  SUBMARINE  CAMPAIGN.A German, official wireless of the 14th April, summarising the results of submarine warfare for February and March, stated that the losses inflicted on the Allies amount-    2S42-3 E
to 1,642,000 tons, of which 861,000 (435 vessels) were sunk during March. Against this, they say that only six submarines have been lost since 1st February. Sir E. HoAvard, referring to the publication of this message by the Wolff Bureau at Stockholm, draws attention to the fact that such statements, if uncontradicted, have a very damaging effect on neutral opinion ; he suggests the issue of a counter-statement, through Reuter, giving, if possible, some idea of the number of submarines, which we have destroyed.By the terms of the agreement proposed by the Swedish Government, practically the whole of. the shipping detained in the Baltic (90,000 out of 96,000 tons) will be allowed to pass out through the Kogrund Channel. Sir E. Howard recommends that the Swedish grain ships now held in British ports should be allowed to proceed at once (assuming that the agreement as a whole meets with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government), because their cargoes are rapidly deteriorating. As regards other Swedish shipping, the arrangement provides that vessels detained in the United Kingdom will be released as and when Swedish ships leave Sweden for British ports,.and not when they arrive in the United Kingdom, Accompanying the British note which embodies the terms of the general arrangement, Sir E. Howard proposes to send two secret letters ; the first states the conditions required of Swedish shipowners in the matter of carrying freight from America for Russia, in return for the release of their vessels; the second refers to similar conditions to be accepted in return for permission to call at ports outside the United Kingdom in special cases.On 14th April Sir M, Findlay reported that the representatives of the Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association, after a meeting with the Prime Minister, had practically decided to accept the British Governments proposals in regard to the requisitioning and distribution of Norwegian tonnage (vide Reports 9 and 11). The Minister for Foreign Affairs would prefer that the arrangements arising out of these proposals should be voluntarily made by the shipowners without Government intervention or legislation. His Majesty&apos;s Minister has reason to anticipate a satisfactory settlement of the question, as public opinion is much disturbed by the frequent sinking of Norwegian ships and the Press is urging that they should be armed, which can only be done by placing them under the British Flag. At the same time he is of opinion that, as Norway&apos;s acceptance of Great Britain&apos;s proposals will seriously threaten the success of Germany&apos;s submarine campaign, reprisals on her part are almost certain,, and these may possibly take the form of an armed attack by air and sea. The Norwegians are particularly afraid of air attacks and for this reason he suggests that it might be well if the British Government were to supply them with anti-aircraft guns and aeroplanes.The Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs has been told by the German Minister at. Copenhagen that the German Admiralty are determined to put a stop to the export of Danisii produce to Great Britain, even if they have to seize a&quot;essels in territorial waters.Sir R. Paget reports that a certain amount of resentment has been evoked in Danish shipping and commercial circles by the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government that cargoes for neutral countries can only be carried by vessels of the country of destination. The United Shipping Company in particular consider that such restrictions imposed on Danish shipping are of a nature to frustrate their efforts and hopes to compete successfully against Germany after the .war. This Company has suffered severely in the Italian and French trades, Avhich they fear they must noAv abandon. Of their seven vessels trading with Italy, three have been sunk and two requisitioned.Germany seems disposed to re-open with the Dutch Government the question of the seven Dutch vessels torpedoed and to offer new conditions for replacing them by German ships. Sir W. Townley has been instructed to inform the Dutch Government that Great Britain would raise no objection to their purchasing German vessels in the manner suggested (vide Report No. 9) provided that payment be not made till after the war, that the Aressels be not resold to Germany or Austria for two years after the declaration, of peace, and that the Dutch Government allot to trade with Allied countries an amount of Dutch tonnage equal to that bought from Germany.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington continues to impress on the State -Department the vital necessity of&apos; providing American ships to cany the American supplies urgently needed by the Allies, and to express the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the only satisfactory method of securing the tonnage needed is by requisitioning. The whole question is receiving the State Departments most serious consideration.
GENERAL.Sir W. Townley has been instructed to ascertain what truth there is in the statement recently published by &quot; De Telegraaf &quot; that German combatants interned in Holland have been given leave to go to Germany to cultivate the land.Sir W. Townley reports that about 40 per cent, of the Austrian and other Jew refugees in Holland have some knowledge of agriculture and forestry, and would be prepared to come to live and work in England, under certain specified conditions and assurances, with the status of prisoners of war. An experimental contingent of about 40 men are prepared to start at once; if the scheme is successful, thousands might be induced to follow.Sir M. Findlay. reports that there are now some 400 Italian reservists, besides Belgians and French, awaiting transport at Christiania and Copenhagen. There are also a large number of Roumanian refugees, mostly penniless ; many of these are women, to whom passages are refused by the shipping companies. Sir M. Findlay &apos; suggests that all be collected together at Christiania and Bergen &apos;and shipped on an armed vessel to be sent by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the purpose.His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Rotterdam transmitted on 12th April information, supplied by French prisoners escaped from Germany, that, as a measure of reprisal,PEACE DISCUSSIONS.A German, official wireless of 14th April says : &quot;The uneasiness of the Entente &quot; Press in respect to conditions in Russia affords much satisfaction.   There  is &quot; increasing pressure to hasten the democratization of Germany, as it is believed that &quot; this would remove the last obstacle to taking up negotiations with Russia.   There &quot; is the keenest activity in Socialistic circles in connection with Russia.   Opinion is &quot; pretty freely expressed on two things, the ending of the war largely through the &quot; instrumentality of Socialists and the prospective  starvation of Europe.    It is &quot; significant that Adler, Renner, and Seitz, the three Austrian  Socialist leaders, &quot; yesterday had a three hours&apos; conference with the Austrian Foreign Minister.   Adler &quot; is expected at Berlin to-day, where it is said he will be joined by Scheidemann, the .&quot; leader of the German Socialists.    It  is  expected  that they will go together to &quot; Copenhagen and Stockholm, and engage in peace discussions with representatives &quot;of   the   Russian   Socialists.&quot;     Two   days   later   Sir   R.    Paget,    referring &quot;to  this Press telegram, reported that  the   Danish   &quot;Social Democraten&quot; was conducting a campaign to promote an understanding between German and Danish Socialists, with a view to initiating peace negotiations.   Herr Stauning, the Socialist Minister, had, however, denied that Copenhagen was being used as a connecting link between German and Russian Socialists for the object of making a separate peace. Sir E. Howard reported on the 13th that the German Imperialist Socialist Sudekum had lately been in Stockholm, but had returned to Berlin extremely  displeased with the anti-German  attitude of Branting,  leader  of  the Swedish   Socialists. The Russian Socialist Lenin, with his companions from Zurich (who had travelled through  germany under German passports) arrived in Stockholm on the 13th, and had prolonged conferences with the Socialists of  the  Extreme Left before proceeding  to Petrograd.    Lenin announced that he would certainly  return to Stockholm  in  a  fortnight  at  the   head  of  a   Russian   peace   deputation.   Pie displayed very   violent   animosity towards   England,  and declared that   if   the Western Powers would not come to terms with Germany, &quot;Russia would make a separate peace.   These and similar utterances no doubt inspired the rumours put about by the Germans in Amsterdam, reported by Sir W. Townley on the 15th, that peace between Russia and Germany would be declared within a fortnight.   On the 16th he reported that Camilie Huysmann was leaving at once for Stockholm, to impress upon the Socialists there assembled that a separate peace between Russia and Germany would only prolong the war.   This opinion is shared by Herr Branting, who at a recent interview with Mr. William Thorne and his party, emphasized the imperative necessity of making Russian workmen and Socialists understand  that Prussian militarism, the worst enemy of Socialist ideals, must be destroyed.   Herr Branting&apos;s visit to Petrograd had left a most hopeful impression on his mind.   The International movement, outside germany, is generally, opposed to the idea of a separate peace, and there are indications that the German people, as distinct from the military clique, recognise that nothing but a general peace will avail them.
thef German Government have suspended the delivery of parcels to all Allied prisoners in Germany. His Majesty&apos;s Government had no confirmation of the report. On the 17th, however, Sir W. Townley telegraphed that, according to a statement in the &quot;Cologne Gazette &quot; of the 12th, the German Military Authorities had stopped the delivery of parcels on the ground that, in cakes sent to prisoners, slips of paper had keen discovered, inciting the recipients to do all possible damage in whatever trade they might be employed. Sir W. Townley has been directed to ascertain whether this statement is official, and, if so, to endeavour to obtain from the German Government evidence of the alleged facts with a view to their investigation.
