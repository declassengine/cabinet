APPRECIATION  OP THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT, No.  19.The Balkans.The Greek situation is one of complete obscurity. Nothing could bo more conciliatory and reasonable than the attitude of M. Zaimis, but whether this foreshadows a graceful surrender to the inevitable, or is only calculated to strengthen the Greek case in. the eyes of the world, and to gain time to organise resistance or secure German help, it is impossible to say.Meanwhile the direct consequence of the Trench attempt to secure control of Greece has been to start Italy off on the scramble for her share of the Balkans. The first step is the proclamation of an Italian protectorate over Albania, in itself as satisfactory a solution of the Albanian problem as can well be expected, but requiring very delicate handling in order to avoid injury to Serbian interests and susceptibilities. The next is to be the Italian occupation of the whole of Epirus to the old Greco-Turkish border.The effect upon the Serbians of this political scramble for territory away from the fighting front has been most unfortunate, and it will need very strong assurances from the British Government (since they7 dislike and distrust the French) that the main object of the Salonika Force is still the liberation of Serbia, to prevent a collapse. There is evidence that the officers recently condemned for conspiracy had actually agreed to make terms with Austria, and if the Serbs are once convinced that the Allies do not mean to keep faith with them they are quite capable of desperate courses. Of course if the French plan succeeds, and Greece falls under French control without resistance, the Serbs will realise that the military situation in the Jialkans is improved, and be to that extent encouraged, much as they dislike the idea of the French retaining a permanent foothold in the Balkans.Very significant at this moment, when his Greek policy is on the eve of being carried out, is the univcral outcry from all quarters, more particularly from the Serbs and Italians, against General Sarrail. The French are not likely to throw him over easily, so the effort to get rid of him wilt probably add yet another element of controversy to the Balkan tangle. General Sarrail&apos;s telegram deprecating the attachment of the Venizelist Cretan Division to the British forces, as having been suggested on political rather than on strictly military grounds, is a masterpiece of simple humour.German and Austrian Affairs.The growing anxiety .in Germany about after-the-war trade questions which the entry of Brazil will naturally increase affords abundant justification for the Paris Resolutions as a war measure. But it is necessary to keep in mind that the pressure which the Allies can apply in this respect is one which affects Germany and not, to any serious extent, her Allies. It is a lever which may get the Germans out of Belgium, or even Lorraine, but which will not help in restoring Serbia or roumania.The internal crisis and wrangling in Germany, Austria and Hungary should not be taken too seriously., It is a natural accompaniment of the process by which the rulers of these countries are getting them into line for a common Middle European policy before peace negotiations begin. Their Socialists and Nationalists, whether allowed to open their mouths at home or to scamper over to Stockholm, are, no doubt,
being, consciously or unconsciously, utilised (o promote the same object, namely, the creation of a solid middle opinion which, if the terms of peace in view are secured, will sustain the Governments against tbe wrath of. their own extreme annexationists, and, in the contrary event, will be prepared for a further continuance of the struggle. ,. r;/r,   .  - &apos;&apos;&apos;  ,   i   Sweden.&apos;! k-        - - .The Swedish situation is very delicate. On the one hand British and American economic pressure and the fear of social, trouble . created by it tend to keep the Government submissive. On the other there is always the possibility of too high-handed action enabling an essentially pro-German Ministry to ,get rid of its internal difficulties hy an appeal to Swedish national sentiment, which may lead to still closer co-operation with Germany and a more or less open breach with the Allies.. - &apos;        : &apos;d)lCNJIAUK;.v. , id    i tli..       &apos; i , .1.The repetition, with regard to Danish bacon, of the unfortunate incident with regard to Danish butter in April, indicates the importance of close co-operation between the Department of Blockade and the Food Controller^ Department.The Stockholm Conference..   u/The attempt of the Petrograd Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council (Soviet) to jump a pledge-bound class-warfare Stockholm Conference upon its Allies without consulting them, or the committee at Stockholm, has created an astonishing situation. The three Allied Socialist or Labour representatives in Petrdgrad thave promptly pro-tested.. It is possible that the recent proclamation may have&apos;been due, to mere irresponsibility, and that the difficulty will be smoothed over, .&apos;. Oh the other hand the Soviet may, in view of the strong attitude of the French Government, again emphasised by ;M. Ribot&apos;s speech ,as reported in to-days., papers, be deliberately playing for a breach with the Allies&apos;. &apos; &apos; i &quot;&quot;&apos;Meanwhile.the emergence of the Seamehs and&apos;Fifemeirs Union as an independent blockading power, which treats pacifists as contraband, is a novel precedent suggestive of all kinds of developments. &apos;  ,    ,      ., &apos; &apos; &apos;.    -The views of Dominion public, men on Peace Terms, as given in the Appendix attached to this Report, are worth careful study. It is essential to&quot; remember that, as the British Empire is not a European but a world power, questions which  a European conference, more particularly a conference of Socialists, would tend to treat as &quot; Colonial,&quot; and of relatively minor importance, are for us domestic questions of the first importance. It is also necessary to remember that the Socialists of the United Kingdom are in no sense entitled to speak on these questions on behalf of the views of ^Labour in the Dominions.L. S. A.7th June 1917.

PART  I.  BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.Arising out of the Resolution passed at the Imperial War Conference on the necessity of the Empire becoming self-sufficing in the matter of meat supplies,1 the Governments of Canada, Australia, and South Africa have been asked if they will each nominate a representative to confer with the Board or Trade on the matter. The New Zealand Government have appointed their Pligh Commissioner for this purpose.As to the Resolution in favour of the control of wool production for the period following the war, the Governments of New Zealand and South Africa have nominated their High Commissioners to serve on a Committee which it is proposed to set up in this connection.GENERAL.With reference to the arrangements for the requisitioning of ships,2 the New-foundland Government have concurred in the proposals outlined.They have also agreed to the policy proposed in relation to trading with Japan&quot; and the Australian Government have similarly concurred.CANADA.AVith regard to requisitioning ships which are in course of. construction for neutrals,3 the Shipping Controller suggests that the Dominion might follow the practice of the United Kingdom of leaving the contract in force until the vessels are completed, and then requisitioning at the agreed price. By this means the burden of financing the matter rests with the neutral who, while anxious to do all that is possible to ensure speedy delivery, also remains responsible under the contract until the Government is able to see that the ship is suitably constructed. If, however, the Dominion Government are already committed to the policy of requisitioning at once the ships now building, or if the Government consider this course is likely to hasten most effectively the completion of the contracts, the British Treasury will be asked to finance the matter on that basis through the Imperial Munitions Board.In reply, the Dominion Government point out that the policy of requisitioning ships at once was aimed at preventing speculation. If action is delayed until the vessels are completed, sales may take place in the interim and the contract price rise in consequence. Such sales, whereby the original contract price has been enhanced, have already been effected in various cases. If in view of these circumstances the Shipping Controller still desires to delay the requisitioning, the Dominion Government will keep back the formal issue of the papers.Telegrams received by the Board of Trade indicate that in order to avoid a deadlock in the arrangements for purchasing cheese in the Dominion, it will be necessaiy to pay higher prices, and that instead of a fixed price the cheese should be purchased in the ordinary trade way. Otherwise production will be affected, and farmers may divert milk to the United States. An announcement has, however, been made that the British Government will pay 2.1 f- cents. f.o.b. Montreal, and the Minister of Agriculture has expressed his hope in the Dominion House of Commons (according to Press reports) that the congestion will now be relieved.As the result of a consultation which has been held between the Minister of Finance and a representative of the British Treasury, the Dominion Government have arranged to renew the loan of $24,000,000 by the Banks, due on 3rd July, for one year. Further, Canada will provide the Imperial Munitions Board with $25,000,000 per month for June, July, and August. The suggestion has been made that the Finance Minister might issue notes against South African gold, which could be ear-marked for the purpose. Sir Thomas White is not in favour of enlarging his note issue without having gold behind it.The Dominion Government have agreed to the whole of the suggested scheme for the purchase and payment of Australasian wool.41 See Western and General Report for week ending- 2nd May 1917.2 See Western and General Report for week ending 30th May 1917.3 See Western and General Report for weeks ending 16th and 23rd May 1917.4 See Western and General Report for weeks ending 18th April and 2nd and 30th May 1917.
NEWFOUNDLAND.The Army Council have intimated that they would he glad if a company of miners-could be raised and maintained if this would not interfere with the provision of reinforcements for the Newfoundland Regiment.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.As the result of an inspection of the Commonwealth Forces on Salisbury Plain,, the Secretary of State has informed the Prime Minister of Australia that he was much impressed with the whole Force, and was asked to convey the message that additional reinforcements were anxiously awaited.The Australian Government report that 6,000 infantry constitute the force which can &quot;be despatched by the next transports.   The infantry already at sea number 2,593, but it is anticipated that 6,407 men will be recruited in time to complete the 15,009&apos; which Australia was asked to supply before the end of August.- In telegraphing about the requisitioning of ships, the British Government point out that it is not now possible to pay attention to such matters as foreign competition,, but only to the conveyance of necessaries. Though the British Government will consult the Dominion Governments before requisitioning United Kingdom ships engaged in important trade,1 yet it is deemed necessary that the views of the British Government should prevail in such cases.With regard to the possibility of supplying shipyard workers for the Admiralty, the Commonwealth Government are reconsidering the position with a view to shipbuilding being carried out in Australia.A Return published by the Commonwealth Defence Department shows that 361,949 men had enlisted up to the end of April 1917. The percentages for each State are given as follows : New South Wales   -	-		-	-   7 &apos; 46 per cent.Victoria	-	-	-	-   6&quot;95Queensland	-		-	-   7-52South Australia	-	-	-	-   6-81Western Australia  -	-		-	-   9-16Tasmania   -	-	-	-	-   6-50In reply to the invitation to&apos; nominate a representative upon the Committee which is being set up hy the Air Board to report on the post-war development of aviation,2&apos; the Commonwealth Government have nominated Major-General J. N. McCay as their representative.The Governor-General reports that the final results of the Federal Elections3 give the Ministerialists 52 seats and the Opposition 22 in the House of Representatives.. The vacancy in Tasmania, caused by death, will probably be filled hy a supporter of Mr. Hughes, which would make his majority 31. In the Senate the supporters of the Government will number 24 and the Opposition 11, while one remains doubtful.. The Federal Parliament will assemble on 14th June.NEW ZEALAND.The Dominion Government have been informed in response to their telegram concerning routes for transports, that convoy will be arranged on the Atlantic side. As to the Pacific route, this is regarded as safe at present, but if any doubt should arise further steps, possibly involving a change of route, would have to be taken.Owing to the great demand for officers at the front, the Dominion Government have been unable to recommend more than about six of the members of their ; expeditionary force for Commissions in the Indian Army Reserve of Officers.SOUTH AFRICA.The Union Ministers, to their great regret, find it impossible to recruit men. for Reserve Parks as suggested by the&apos; Arm)&apos; Council.4   Recruiting for infantry1 See Western and General Report for week ending 30tli May 1917. 2 See Western and General Report for week ending 9th May 1917.3 The results in certain constituencies remained doubtful when the Press estimates were S&quot;iv9n in &quot;Western and General Report of 9th May 1917.* See Western and General Report for week ending 16th May 1917.
reinforcements, field artillery, motor cyclists, Sec, for Europe and East Africa lias drawn heavily upon the remaining Europeans, while the Cape coloured corps battalion and horse transports have taken so many coloured men that Ministers are certain that they could not find men for the proposed Reserve Parks.It is considered by the Union Government that some local control over the allotment of cargo space in homeward bound vessels should be arranged, in order to avoid difficulties in shipping certain exports required in the United Kingdom. For this and other reasons a local controller of shipping is suggested, who should be constantly informed by the Shipping Controller as to priority matters, who should give information to shippers in South Africa, and who should be able to decide questions of cargo space in co-operation with the Shipping Controller. It is considered that the functions of the controller could be best discharged by the Union Department of Industries.The hope of the Army Council has been, expressed, that the Union Government will do all that they can to supply General Northey with motor cyclists at the earliest date possible.The Union Government have called attention to the serious position which will arise if the whole of the surplus crop of maize1 is not purchased by the British Government. On the understanding that the British authorities undertook to purchase any surplus of the 1917 crop, the farmers increased their production. The Wheat Commission have arranged for certain purchases through the merchants, hut only a part of the amount which the merchants have agreed to sell to the British Government has up till now been bought. It is therefore important that it should be known definitely that the whole of the surplus crop will be bought by the United Kingdom ; otherwise the price of mealies will fall, and many farmers will be ruined.With reference to the suggestion of the Union Government to that effect2, the Admiralty have agreed to utilise the available space in homeward, bound auxiliary cruisers for cargoes from South Africa. It is remarked, however, that the vessels might at any time be diverted and consequently that it would not be possible to ensure punctual delivery,RHODESIA.The undesirability of retaining natives as carriers beyond, the time for which they enlisted, to which attention was called, by the Government of Northern Rhodesia,3 has been brought to the attention of General Northey, who points out that if the -carriers had not been kept he would have been forced to abandon important operations between October and January last. The policy of using every effort to release old carriers when reliefs arrive, will be continued.The Governor of Nyasaland wishes that the British South Africa Company may be reminded that, they have a part in the campaign in German East Africa, and that the brunt of this in the south-west area has hitherto fallen on Nyasaland.NYASALAND.General Northey reports (30th May) that the enemy on the Nyasaland border have been driven back to the line Mtonya-Luambala River, about 60 miles north of Fort Mangoche. Later (4th June) the enemy were reported to be concentrating at Mtengula. A Portuguese force of 700 is at Chinde, but it is anticipated that the native soldiers are disaffected. The Portuguese are, however, sending a force to M lanje.The Governor reports that the supplies of carriers from Nyasaland during 1915-16 amounted to 10,000 front line carriers and 24,000 for supplies and. lines of communi-cation. During 1916-17 about 12,000 were employed in the front line and 46,000 on lines of communication, &amp;c. Others, not recorded, were employed on military roads. The numbers given above are irrespective of Rhoclesian carriers and others obtained by General Northey in the course of his advance.1 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 9tli and 23rd May 1917. 2 See Western and General Report for week ending 9th May 1917. 8 See Western and General Report for week ending 16th May 1917. 3209-1 B
Compulsion was applied in Nyasaland through the Chiefs and headmen.   A few-punishments were necessary, but the exercise of any greater force than that employed might have resulted in a revolt such as that which has occurred in Portuguese East -Africa.PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.In reply to the telegram from the Union Government of South Africa, the Secretary of State states (1st June) that the Portuguese Government have been urged for months past to allow the general recruiting of carriers in Portuguese East Africa,, but np to the present no agreement has been obtained.   They will now again be urged to consent to this course.It should be added, however, that in a telegram of the same date (1st June) the Governor of Nyasaland points out that Portuguese East Africa, on which he had hoped to draw for carriers, is now closed by the reA^olt in the southern part and by the invasion of the enemy in the northern.EAST AFRICA. PROTECTORATE.The Indian community at Nairobi have conveyed to His Majesty the Ring, through. the Indian Association, their heartfelt congratulations on Empire Hay, aed their prayer that the British Empire may emerge from this righteous war more united, self-contained and expanded, and that the war may terminate soon in favour of the Allies.The report of the Officer Commanding the troops at Turkana,2 dated 18th May, states that a force of about 250 Abyssinians entered Dodosa on 15th May, captured Loyoro, together with 300 cattle and 100 donkeys. They surrounded the British patrol of 15 men, but on the arrival of the Officer Commanding with 22 further men, the patrol was released. The British losses were four killed and eight wounded, but the Abyssinians lost heavily.   The situation has now improved.LIBERIA.The British Ambassador to the United States was authorised on 1st June to co-operate with the French Ambassador in arrangements for the removal and intern-ment in France of the Germans now in Liberia. The Liberian Government, however,, desire that these German subjects should be sent to neutral countries, as Liberia is not yet at war with Germany ; and having regard to their state of health the British Consul at Monrovia considers that they had better be sent to Germany or to a neutral country. The United States clo not desire to discuss the matter until satisfactory -assurances have been received regarding the resumption of Liberian trade.JAMAICA. *   .The Governor considers (in a telegram dated 25th May) that the delay in sending the present contingent is due to the time that was lost in beginning recruiting work after the last contingent was despatched, and also to the effect of the Military Service Act, which has resulted in men waiting until they are called up under it. Registration commenced on the 1st June, and every effort is being made to ensure that a contingent will be ready for the next trausport. The Governor reports that he assented to the Military Service Law on the 1st June.A contingent of the British West Indies Regiment numbering 31 officers &quot;and. 1,650 men sailed by the &quot; Briton &quot; on 1st June.- WINDWARD ISLANDS.The Secretary of State has agreed to the suggestion of the Governor1 to bring the-matter of conscription before the Executive Council. He considers that similar action, should be taken in St. Lucia and St. Vincent if practicable.h*See Western and General Report for week ending 30th May 1917. 2 See Western and General Report for week ending 23rd May 1917..
PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.FRANCE.Lord Bertie learns on good authority that at the secret sitting of the Chamber on 4th June the discussion was chiefly concerned with secret treaties. M. Briand was again compelled (as on 2nd June) to explain and defend the instructions given by him to M. Doumergue on his visit to Russia last February in regard to the annexationist war aims of the French Government. M. Renaudel, leader of the Unified Socialists, protested against the whole system of secret diplomacy. Much excitement was caused among the Socialist Members by the news published in the evening papers of the Russian workmen&apos;s Committees&apos; manifesto, calling on labour in all countries to unite against Imperialism and convoking the Congress at Stockholm for the end of June. Finally, the news of the serious conflict between Annamite soldiers and the people of St. Ouen led to a violent protest by the Socialist deputies. Only the Minister of War&apos;s eloquent appeal for a united front against the enemy enabled M. Ribot to carry with something like unanimity his order of the day. The order emphasised the determina-tion of France, while disclaiming all ideas of conquest, to liberate the invaded territories, recover Alsace and Lorraine, and to exact restitution for the damage done:Referring to the continuance of strikes at Paris and to M. Ribot&apos;s reference to the part played by foreigners in instigating them, Lord Bertie reported on 1st June that several suspicious aliens had been arrested who were found to be in possession of large sums of money. Foreigners were being weeded out of works and factories. On 2nd June he observed that in many cases the strikes are due to female agitation, rather sympathetic than inspired by direct economic grievances. On 4th June, he stated that troops were being brought to the capital to be ready for emergencies, but the situation was improving. There was talk of changing the Military Governor -of Paris.ITALY.The Italian Ambassador has drawn the attention of the Foreign Office to certain recent articles in the English Press (e.g., the &quot; Manchester Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot;) which appear to him symptomatic of a campaign against the fulfilment of Italy&apos;s war aims. The prospect of such a campaign filled him with the greatest anxiety,- as its effect in Italy would be in every sense deplorable. If the Italians were convinced that they were likely to be baulked of their &quot; aspirations &quot; they would, in his opinion, make a separate peace with Austria and might even be led to join the Central Powers. Lord Robert Cecil in reply stated that Great Britain would assuredly observe all her Treaty obligations ; but he certainly was not prepared to say that the war would end in such a way as to enable all the Allies to obtain the fulfilment of all their war aims. Great Britain, for example, might be asked by Russia to make concessions in regard, to the German Colonies ; in the same way, Italy might be asked to modify the arrangements that had been made with her. If the Austrians were to ask for terms for a separate peace, it would be madness for the Allies to refuse to consider such a proposal. For the present, however, the discussion seemed premature.BELGIUM.The head of the German Political Department at Brussels has handed to the Spanish Minister a Note (transmitted to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid) in which are set forth the various measures taken by the German authorities to prevent
the export from Belgium into Germany of cattle and food materials. In forwarding this Note, the Spanish Minister at Brussels has expressed the hope that, as the inhabitants of the occupied territories are threatened with famine, and the Relief Commission^ stores well-nigh exhausted, His Majesty&apos;s Government will take all possible steps to reorganise the importation of foodstuffs into Belgium.SWITZERLAND.An immediate result of the German-Swiss Convention, recently concluded, has-been to stiffen the Swiss authorities&apos; control of the export of munitions to the Allies. Carbide of calcium, for example, is now to be included under the heading of explosives. The British and French Legations have made energetic protest and demanded the immediate establishment of a corresponding control over exports of munitions to Germany and Austria. Sir H. Bumbold says that the Swiss Government are making arrangements to give effect to this demand and are generally inclined to be reasonable and conciliatory.GREECE.In Anew of the decisions recorded at the Anglo-French Conference of ,last week, intended to secure united political action, the British and French representatives were instructed not to attend the Te Deum service on King Constant,ine&apos;s name day, 3rd June (the American Minister was the only Allied representative present). Sir F. Elliot, telegraphing on 30th May, anticipated this festival with gloomy forebodings. In the opinion of many observers, he said, serious trouble might be precipitated at any moment by news of the advance of the French in Thessaly. There were the usual rumours of an impending massacre of Venizelists by the Royalists at Athens. He drew the attention of M. Zaimis to these rumours, who assured him that they were groundless. It was subsequently reported on reliable authority at Athens that on the 2nd June M. Zaimis had caused the arrest of sixty agents provocateurs engaged by the French Secret Service to create disturbances. On the same day, acting under instructions from the Foreign Oflice, and speaking as representative of one of the Guaranteeing Bowers, Sir F. Elliot pointed out to the Greek Government that these perpetually recurring rumours of imminent disorder constitute a grave reproach to the Greek authorities. To this M. Zaimis replied that his Government might be held responsible for disorder and outrages, but not for rumours. He attributed the credence given to these rumours to the generally panicky state of the public mind. As a matter of fact, the day passed off without incident. As regards an advance into Thessaly by the French and Allied troops, M. Zaimis said that, although the measure seemed to him unnecessary, no objection would be raised by the Greek Government, and the peace would not be disturbed unless there was an advance of Venizelist forces.M. Jonnart was expected to reach Athens on 4th June, with express instructions to proceed as rapidly as possible with the arrangements for purchasing the crops in Thessaly. With reference to the political and other arrangements decided upon by the Conference for putting an end to the strife between Royalists and Venizelists and restoring the unity of Greece, it was understood that M. Jonnart, as High Commis-sioner, would represent Great Britain and France in Greece, and (in the event of their concurring) Russia and Italy. There seems, however, little or no prospect of his being able to reconcile all the conflicting local interests and policies of the Allies, or to secure the support of Russia and Italy for the line of action laid down by the Conference. On one vital point, for example, that of King Constantine&apos;s remaining on the throne, there is a wide gulf between the policy of the present Russian Govern-ment and that of the Italian. The Russians not only favour the deposition of King Constantine, but are opposed to his being succeeded by any of his sons, on the ground that this would perpetuate German influences and ignore the people&apos;s right to choose their own riders. Baron Sonnino holds that the deposition of King Constantine is unnecessary under existing conditions, and would arouse much opposition in Italy. In any case, should his abdication be required, it was understood at the Conference at
St. Jean de Mauri enne that one of his sons would succeed him with the least possible change in constitutional procedure. Under these circumstances, the Foreign Office has instructed .Sir F. Elliot (3rd June; to inform M. Jonnart of the attitude of the Italian Government, and to suggest that the purposes of the Allies might be sufficiently met if King Constant! ne could be induced to withdraw from Greece till the end of the war, entrusting the Government to one of his sons as Regent. With reference to these instructions, Lord Granville observes (4th June) that if this means the recall of M. Venizelos to power, and if the Regency is only intended to be a gilding of the pill of permanent abdication, M. Venizelos would no doubt accept the arrangement ; but he would certainly refuse any modus vivendi which involves or implies the King&apos;s eventual return.On 4th June the French Government suggested to the Russian Government that Prince Demidoff should be recalled from Athens, his intimate relations with King Constantine making his continued presence there undesirable. They urged that a Charge d&apos;Affaires should assume charge of the Russian Legation under the control of M. Jonnart until the constitutional regime is restored. At the moment, however, neither the Russian nor the Italian Government are disposed to acquiesce in the appointment of M. Jonnart as High Commissioner representing the Allies. Nor are they read;/ to acquiesce in any military decisions, that would lead to a weakening of the Salonika front. The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs holds that the abandonment of Monastic would, have deplorable results, not only for Serbia, but for the whole Allied cause. He is also strongly of opinion that any action which the Allies may take at Athens should not be prompted, (as is that of the French) by political motives, but only by military considerations. Both the Russian and Italian Governments have expressed their grave misgivings concerning the political ambitions of General Sarrail and the clangers to which the forces at Salonika are exposed by his Thessalian adventures. General Petitti, commanding the Italian forces in Greece, goes much farther. After strongly protesting against General Sarraills weakening of the Macedonian front, he expresses his conviction, &quot;unanimously shared in military spheres at Salonika,&quot; that the time has come to recall General Sarrail, &quot;whose unqualified irresponsibility tends to - jeopardise a situation already sufficiently grave.&quot; General Cadorna, in forwarding these views to Baron Sonnino, confirms them and adds that the situation under General Sarraibs direction has become intolerable and a source of grave danger to italy and her Allies. Furthermore, the Italian Minister at Athens has informed his Russian colleague that if the French occupy Thessaly, Italy, as a guarantee, will occupy Epirus down to the Gulf of Arta. The divergence of opinions and policies in - Greece is in fact becoming acute.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome discussed the difficulties of the situation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 4th J une. Baron Sonnino eventually stated that he was prepared to let the Guaranteeing Powers deal with the situation, Italy standing aside. He did not believe that any Regency compromise would alter the situation ; the French, he thought, are resolved on a ,policy which he regarded as morally unjustifiable. As to M. Jonnart superseding General Sarrail, he did not believe in it, for M. Jonnart has no political party behind him and General Sarrail has. Sir R. Rodd considers it very unlikely that the Italian Government will identify themselves with Anglo-French policy in Greece.The Government at Athens have ordered two enquiries to be held, one judicial and one administrative, into the murderous assault committed on Naval Lieutenants Burns and Campbell on 29th May. So far these enquiries have failed to reveal any evidence of premeditation or political motive for the crime.Sir F. Elliot reports that the Greek Government have accepted the scheme of Allied Controls, as called for by the Collective Note of the Allied Representatives on 2nd May. They are also taking up the question of the Decree of Amnesty in favour of Venizelists and of the release of political prisoners on both sides. The attitude of M. Zaimis and his colleagues has, in fact, become so remarkably reasonable and ingratiating, as to lend confirmation to the report, forwarded fry Sir F. Elliot on 1st June, that the Palace had learned of the intended occupation of Thessaly and deposition of the King. On 2nd June M. Zaimis took occasion to inform His Majesty&apos;s Minister that he was making good progress in the work of reconciliation. The King-was with him ; even General Dousmanis was not opposed to the idea of bringing back M. Veuizelos. All that was needed was that His Majesty&apos;s Government should persuade M. Venizelos not to be vindictive and that the good seed of reconciliation be given time to bear fruit. Sir F. Elliot proposed (3rd June) to visit Salonika (if M. Jonnart approved) and endeavour to persuade M. Venizelos to meet these overtures in a reasonable spirit.   The Foreign Office, in reply, authorised him to discuss the3209-1      &apos; c
matter with M. Jonnart, observing that while His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound by the resolutions of the recent Conference, and cannot press M, Jonnart to adopt any policy they would be glad, should he see fit, to favour the idea of a reconciliation between M. Venizelos and the -King.The French Government have informed Lord Bertie that General Sarrail considers it inexpedient to give effect to the request of M. A7enizelos that the Cretan Division should serve with the forces on the British section of the Salonika front. The French Government consider that the request was based on political considerations ; General Sarraihs point of view is purely military, and he holds that the Cretan Division should remain at his disposal to use as he may think best.A German official wireless characterises as a clumsy lie the story of the 4th Greek Corps being brought back from Germany to fight against their countrymen at Monastir. It is easy to prove that these Greeks are still in Germany, it observes, because their relatives in Greece still receive letters from Goerlitz regularly, in which there is no mention of the Monastir front.ALBANIA.On 3rd June, His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Corfu reported that General Marro, head of the Italian Mission, had on that day announced the establishment of an Italian Brotectorate over Albania. At Argyrocastro, on the same day, the Italian Commander-in-Chief in Albania proclaimed the independence of Albania under the protection of Italy.An official communique on the subject was published at Rome on the 4th, giving the text of this proclamation. In this document, General Ferrero, Commander of the Italian corps of occupation in Albania, by order of the King of Italy, &apos;; solemnly &quot; proclaims the unity and independence of the whole of Albania under the aegis and &quot; protection of the Kingdom of Italy.&quot; All Albanians, mindful of their ancient and noble connections with the civilisation of Rome and Venice, are invited &quot; to swear &quot; eternal loyalty to the proclamation issued to-day in the name of the Italian &quot; Government of an independent Albania, befriended and protected by Italy.&apos;1On learning from Sir C. des Graz of the issue of this proclamation, the Foreign Office directed Sir R. Rodd to draw the attention of the Italian Government to the matter, assuming that the military authorities had acted without instructions. Before receiving these instructions, however, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who explained that the establishment of an Italian Protectorate was necessitated by the exigencies of a difficult situation, to reunite and liberate the Albanian people. The proclamation, he maintained, was in accordance with the Allied Convention with Italy, which had contemplated the establishment of a Moslem Albanian State under the diplomatic tegis of Italy. The object of the present step was to prevent any other nation from seizing Albania ; to make a sort of Gibraltar of Valona and leave the rest of the country independent, on the principle of recognising nationalities. He admitted the difficulty of defining Albania geo-graphically.in this connection it is of interest to note that, according to the &quot; Neue Freie Presse,&quot; the establishment of an autonomous Albania, under Austrian protection, is regarded as necessary.SERBIA.*&apos;&quot;&quot;&quot; In last week&apos;s Report it was recorded that the Serbian Government had addressed a communication to the Allies with regard to the new policy in the Balkans ; they apprehended the gravest dangers to Serbia, and a crushing effect on the moral of the Serbian Army of any weakening of the forces on the Balkan front. Sir C. des Graz rex^orted on 31st May that the Prime Minister had returned to Corfu after visiting the Serbian front en route. He and other Ministers expressed deep anxiety at the situation, and an earnest hope that the Powers would favourably consider their requests, upon which the whole future of Serbia depends. If they are abandoned now, by a withdrawal of the Allied forces, their last hope of ultimate recovery is lost. From other quarters His Majesty&apos;s Government are informed that the Serbian Government are discussing the possibility of a separate peace with Austria, in order to save something of a situation, which must become hopeless if the Allies withdraw large forces from the Salonika front. All the facts of the situation emphasise the necessity which was recognised by the Conference of 29th May, for avoiding military operations in Old Greece, if possible.
SPAIN.The proposals of the Spanish Government for modification of the Cortina agree-ment, embodied in the form of a new text, were handed to Sir A. Hardinge and forwarded by him to the Foreign Office on 21st May (vide Report No. 17). Upon examination, this new text now proves to bear little or no relation to the agreement originally drawn up in the form proposed by the Marquis de Cortina and signed by him under instructions from the Spanish Government. Under these circumstances, Sir A. Hardinge has been instructed to express the surprise felt by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment that the Spanish Government shoidd not regard themselves as bound in honour to carry out the general provisions of an agreement thus negotiated. The British Government would have been prepared to consider the modification of points of detail ; but the substitution of entirely different provisions is another matter.Despite the plain hints conveyed by Sir A. Hardinge and the United States Ambassador at Madrid to the Spanish Government that they must in future look to Great Britain only for coal, they evidently hope to be able to secure supplies from the United States before the machinery for combined pressure -has been fully organised at Washington. On 3.1st May the Foreign Office notified Sir G. Spring Bice that two ships were leaving Spain in ballast for the United States, presumably to load coal. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador was directed to urge the -State Department to expedite the necessary measures to prevent coal being shipped by these or other vessels to Spain.GERMAN AFFAIRS.A significant statement occurs in tile &quot; Vossische Zeitung &quot; concerning Germany&apos;s relations with Japan. There should be no difficulty, it declares, in arranging a separate peace with Japan, allowing her to retain Kiaochao in return for &quot; certain arrangements &quot; in regard to the future of the South Sea Colonies. Similarly-, the &quot; Kolnisehe Zeitung,&quot; discussing Germany&apos;s ivelt-politik, declares that her future is bound up with that of Russia and Japan ; a statement which it supports by many interesting and ingenious arguments. The same idea finds expression in other papers. The &quot; Weser Zeitung&quot; of 3rd June discusses three alternative reasons which may explain Japaids mobilisation of her forces, namely, either to be in a position to enforce her demands at the Peace Conference, or to attack America, or to bring pressure to bear on Russia. Generally speaking the German Press displays an unusual lack of intelligent anticipation in discussing men and events in the Far East.Idle &quot;Deutsche Tageszeitung,&quot; criticising the &quot; Ivolnische&apos;s &quot; suggestion of a rapprochement with Russia and Japan, holds that Germany&apos;s natural &quot; orientation towards Russia &quot; can never be successful until England has been defeated, audit therefore deprecates the energy recently wasted by German politicians and Press in the attempt to conciliate Russia. But public opinion is sharply divided on this subject.. The great industrial interests represented by the &quot; Rheinish Westphaelische &quot; are all for attacking Russia before she has had time to recover. On 1st June this organ, after regretting the opportunities that have already been lost &quot; of exploiting the confusion in the East,&quot; observed : &quot; We have no desire to split up Russia, but we &quot; are firmly determined to find indemnities for our victorious war in the East, not in &quot; mouey, but in land.&quot;The &quot; Kreuz Zeitung &quot; and other organs continue to display increasing anxiety concerning after-the-war trade questions, and the evident intention of Great Britain and her Allies to isolate Germany commercially. They point to Manchester^ conversion to the idea of a protective tariff, to the British Trade Bank scheme, and to the prospect of an effective Imperial British Zollverein, combined with a most-favoured-nation trade understanding between Great Britain and her Allies, including America. By these means, they foresee, Germany will, be deprived of the raw materials which are essential to her industries and commercial independence. In the same vein, the &quot; Kolnische Zeitung&quot; (30th May) predicts that it will be impossible for Germans to pursue after the war their schemes of peaceful economic penetration in Great Britain and her colonies, and that a great number of Germany&apos;s &quot; best and most capable sons &quot; will be compelled to start life afresh under conditions of great hardship. The once thriving businesses which they held in London, -Paris, and other enemy cities will exist no more. The &quot; Kolnische &quot; advises that if these useful citizens are not to be lost to Germany for good, it will be necessary to find new fields for their activities *&quot; amongst Germany&apos;s new friends in the near East.&quot;
The alarming increase recently noted&apos;in the number of destructive fires in several German cities is generally ascribed to sabotage either by foreign labour or &quot;peace cranks.&quot;According to the &quot; Berliner Tageblatt &quot; (3rd June) the Saxon Premier, Count von Vitzthum, has gone to Vienna to discuss with the Austrian Government the Donaw-Elbe Canal scheme and other questions.AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.&apos; The first meeting of the Reichsrath was accompanied by large Social Democratic peace meetings in all districts of Vienna. Neither the opening ceremony itself, nor the young emperor&apos;s tactfully phrased Speech from the Throne, seem to have inspired the members of the Reichsrath with any strong sentiment of common patriotism. The weekly Report of the Bureau of Information for 2nd June points out that the Speech from the Throne is capable of double interpretation throughout. While containing professions of devotion to constitutionalism, it plainly hints that the Galician and Bohemian questions are to be dealt with by the prerogative of the Crown before the new Emperor takes the constitutional oath. The Czechs, not satisfied with the promise of special treatment for Bohemia, replied by openly asking for a fecleralisecl Austria, in which the Slovak regions of Hungary are to be united with Bohemia. This open declaration of Avar on the &quot;Magyar State idea&quot; is significant of future developments, but is not likely to have immediate practical consequences. The mere fact that Dr. Gross, a militant German, who has long led the struggle against the Czechs in MoraAua. has been elected President of the Chamber shows that such concessions as may be made to Slav aspirations are likely to be kept well within limits.With regard to the Hungarian situation the Information Bureau points out that not only Andrassy, the new Premier, but most of the leading Magyars who are likely to compose the new Cabinet, such as Apponyi, Wekerle, Berzeviczy, and Zichy, have been, actively concerned in the propaganda,for closer relations between. Hungary and Germany. The new Government will, in fact, be a &quot; Mitteleuropa &quot; Government with a tolerant attitude to nationalism outside Hungary, and even some slight concession to franchise reform within Hungary.According to information received from a recognised authority on Polish affairs in. Switzerland, the German and Austrian Governments have come to an agreement in principle as to the re-establishment of a Regency in Poland, but not as to the person of the future Regent, Count GoluchoAvski, as well as the Archduke Charles Stephen, being mentioned. The &quot; Lokal Anzeiger&quot; of 27th May, hoavever, stated that the appointment of a Regent had again been postponed.SWEDEN.Concerning the methods and objects of the blockade-pressure to be brought to bear on Sweden, Sir E. Howard continues to urge that, politically speaking, it is inadvisable to apply it with such severity as to create AAudespread distress and consequent hostility to Great Britain. On 31st May he pointed out that no demand, for the cessation of the export to Germany of Swedish home products has ever yet been formulated by Great Britain, and that, if it is now made, it should be done in association Avith the United States GoA-ernment. Sir E. Howard feels strongly that the Scandinavian countries should not be led to give England all the odium for the blockade, and that it should be made quite clear to them that the United States Government (whose prestige is high with the working classes) are equally responsible for it. In the meanwhile, with a view to mitigating the rigour of the economic and industrial situation (which is giving the Swedish Government cause for acute anxiety), he urges that certain American cargoes be allowed to come forward (via Halifax gradually) of commodities that do not form a constituent part of Swedehs present exports to Germany.The situation, as regards foodstuffs and raw materials requisite for SwedeiPs industries, is undoitbtedly serious. Baron AdelsAvard expressed his opinion to Sir E. HoAvard on 2nd June that unless relief is forthcoming there will be a partial famine before next harvest.   Great BritahPs refusal to allow vessels with food and
raw materials to come from the United States was creating a painful impression amongst Swedish Members of Parliament,; On the following day the Minister for Foreign Aifairs took an extremely depressed view of the outlook. The cotton mills, he said, would soon have to close for lack of materials and unemployment would be . general. Sir E. Howard, in reply7, observed that Swreden&apos;had been frequently warned that her facilities for overseas traffic must depend on the resumption of Anglo-Swedish trade upon normal lines. He derived from this conversation an impression that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would be willing to accept almost any conditions that the United States Government may impose in return for supplies, and that his chief anxiety7 is to know the worst quickly7. In this connection, the Foreign Office has instructed Sir E. Howard that, pending settlement in the United States of the joint blockade policy, it is not advisable to inform the Swedish Government of the conditions which the United States Government have been advised, to adopt. Pie is authorised, however, to convey a discreet intimation in the sense that Sweden will be given all necessary facilities for&apos;importing what she actually7 needs if the Swedish Government puts an end once and for all. to her exports to Germany and takes effective steps to facilitate the transit of goods to Russia. Provisional facilities have been given (5th June) for the importation of a certain quantity of wheat and maize.The regulation recently made by the Swedish authorities to prohibit Swedish fishermen from, landing their catch outside Sweden still leaves loopholes for evasion of the object which it was intended to fulfil, viz., the cessation of fish export to Germany. Sir R. Paget advises that, to make the regulation effective, it should apply7 to fishing of every kind in the North Sea, and that no transhipments of catches should be allowed at sea, or other dispensations. Sir E. Howard has been instructed to request the Swedish Government to amend the regulation accordingly.Germany is reported to have bought 2-1 million tons of iron ore in the north, of Sweden for early shipment. Mr. Branting has on more than one occasion suggested that the Swedish Government should use these exports, necessary7 to Germany, as leverage to compel Germany to cease from sinking Swedish ships. Sir E. Howard reports that popular feeling is tending strongly towards the adoption of this idea.NORWAY.His Majesty\s Minister at Christiania has been, instructed to draw the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the fact that the Norwegian authorities have threatened to expropriate certain aluminium, factories which, though nominally Norwegian, are actually foreign (i.e., English, and French) properties. The Norwegian authorities have demanded, that these works shall supply sufficient metal to meet the requirements of the Norwegian Government with preference over all other demands, prohibiting export until the question is settled. His majesty&apos;s Government hope that, as on a previous occasion, the action thus taken is the result of excessive zeal on the part of subordinate officials.DENMARK.His Majesty the King of Denmark has arranged to visit the King of Norway from the 6th to 10th June.Sir R. Paget reports that a situation has arisen in regard to the export of Danish bacon to England, similar to that which was produced in April, by the refusal of British importers to accept consignments of Danish butter. (Vide Report No. 10, et seq.) The reason now given by7 bacon importers for instructing their Copenhagen, agents to defer further shipments is, that the supplies of American and Canadian bacon greatly7 exceed market requirements. They7 complain, also, that the Danish article is not in good condition. Sir R. Paget observes that, in view of the instructions given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to impress upon the Danish authorities their obligation to send more bacon to England and less to Germany7, the action of British importers has created a deplorable impression.-    CHINA.In nominating Li Ching-hsi for the Premiership, the President and his friendstook a step which was calculated to appeal to many orthodox literati and to certaininfluential elements in metropolitan politics;   but certain sordid aspects of the3209-1 d
political struggle, combined with. Li Ching-hsTs personal reputation for dignity and . responsibility in office, made it doubtful from the outset whether he would accept the honour thus thrust upon him. It was also clear, when Premier Tuan Chi-jui refused to accept his dismissal and appealed for support to the Military Governors, that the helding of Cabinet office in Peking must be precarious for some time to come. The expected has now happened. Li declines the Premiership, the Military Governors have endorsed Tuan&apos;s protest and demanded that Parliament be dissolved and the Constitution re-drafted. In support of these views they are preparing to move troops on Peking, and Tuan has established the headquarters of the opposition at Tientsin. On 30th May, when several provinces had announced their independence of the Central Government, Mr. Alston expressed the opinion that the development of the situation, would depend largely on the attitude adopted by the Japanese in Fengtien and Shantung ; but the Japanese Minister is not disposed to be communicative on the subject. According to Press reports of 3rd June, the Military Governors have decided to form an independent Provisional Government under the nominal direction of Hsu. Shih-chang, an aged official of the old school, formerly Viceroy of Manchuria and guardian of the Heir Apparent under the Manclms. Chang Hsun&apos;s record, combined with this emergence of Hsii Shih-chang, would appear to justify the conclusion that the Military Governors are considering a restoration of the monarchy, towards which the Japanese Government have lately been well disposed. On 4th June, Mr. Alston reported that the President had given no indication of his intentions, but it is expected that in the face of the superior forces against him, he will resign and that there will be no fighting.JAPAN.In accordance with the instructions of the Foreign Office (vide last Report), Sir C. Greene has addressed a Note to the Japanese Government asking, in view of the urgency of the tonnage question, that they should allocate ships directly to the Allies for the purposes of the war. The Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the matter with His Majesty&apos;s Minister on 1st June, and undertook to give it his best consideration.In return for sending four more destroyers to European waters, the Japanese Ambassador has asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government should relax the restrictions now imposed on the export of certain materials, especially steel, needed in ship-building. The Secretary of State replied that Great Britain requires all her output of steel, and suggested that the Japanese Government should apply to the United States.   His Excellency regarded the suggestion as impracticable.The Minister for Foreign Affairs has drawn the attention of Sir C. Greene to the striking discrepancy between - the reassuring reports on the Russian situation fumished hy Japanese officers in Russia, and the extremely pessimistic account of affairs given in the &apos;&apos; Morning Post &quot; of 18th May. As the latter was presumably passed for publication by the British Censorship, and as it had created a very gloomy impression in Tokio, the Japanese Government desired to be supplied with any information available as to its authorship or value.BRAZIL.The Senate has passed the Bill (2nd June) revoking BraziTs earlier Decree of neutrality, in so far as the United States are concerned, and a new Decree has been issued hy the President accordingty. The bill also empowers the Government to seize and use German ships in Brazilian waters ; possession thereof was taken on 3rd June. Finally, it authorises the Government to enter into such agreements with friendly nations as shall assure to Brazil freedom for her trade, and &quot;for this purpose, whensoever expedient, to revoke the Decree of neutrality. A re-opening of negotiations on the coffee export question was evidently contemplated by this enactment.On &apos;ith June Sir C. Spring Rice reported that the Brazilian Ambassador had approached him, by order of his Government, and suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take some conciliatory steps to allay the agitation now increasing in influential quarters in Brazil, where Great Britaims embargo on coffee importations is cited as an argument against Brazil assisting the Allies in the war. The Ambassador suggested that coffee might be admitted if and when carried in Brazilian ships. If no such relief is practicable, the Brazilian Government would welcome any statement
of British, policy which they could use publicly to meet the agitation which threatens to produce a political crisis.According to a German official  wireless message of 1st June, the Brazilian Government have ordered a census to be taken of all Germans resident in Brazil.ECUADOR.The Government of Ecuador have proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should allowed limited importations of Ecuador cocoa into Great Britain. If this concession is granted, Ecuador will undertake to ship 1.000 tons of sugar with every 2,000 tons of cocoa. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Quito strongly recommends that the matter be arranged, as he considers that it may prove to be politically important.CHILE AND BERU.Neither the Chilean nor the Peruvian Government are prepared to follow the example of Brazil in the matter of placing armed guards on board German vessels. At Santiago, as at Lima, His Majesty&apos;s Minister has been informed that the necessity for taking such a step is not recognised. In both cases mention was made of the report that the Argentine Government had reconsidered their action and had withdrawn the guards placed aboard German ships at Buenos Aires.MEXICO.Mr. Cummins, His Majesty&apos;s representative in Mexico (acting provisionally in the absence of Mr. Thurstan), reported on 31st May that the Mexican Government are planning further measures of predatory legislation. A Bill is being prepared by virtue of which foreigners owning mines within SO kilometres of the frontier, or 100 kilometres of the coast, will be compelled to sell them within three months. Foreigners owning mines in other parts of Mexico will, be required to become naturalised within six. months.Commenting on the situation created by measures of this kind, Sir C. Spring Rice observed (1st June) that it would seem best to leave the position of British repre-sentative in Mexico irregular for the time being. The State Department at Washington are of the same mind, and think that it would be well if the French and Spanish Ministers were also withdrawn, as a hint to Carranza. In the meanwhile, Sir C. Spring Rice recommends that the Mexicau representatives at Allied capitals be warned that the Powers are too deeply engaged for the moment to give much attention to Mexican affairs, but the score of these unjustifiable attacks on foreign property is being carefully kept and there will be a day of reckoning. His M.ajesty&apos;s Government concur in these proposals.COSTA RICA.On 31st May Sir C. Mallet reported that the party of Castro Quesada is actively intriguing to bring about the- downfall of Sehor Tinoco ; their first object being to delay recognition of the Government by the United States. Sir C. Mallet foresees a danger of German influence coming to the front again if these intrigues are success-ful ; Costa Rica contains powerful machinery for propaganda in a body of German, priests under a German bishop, it would seem as if the Quesada faction are likely to attain their ends, for Mr. Lansing has informed Sir C. Spring Rice (2nd June) that President Wilson has now definitely decided not to recognise the administration of -Senor Tinoco, or any other Government that is not constitutionally elected.UNITED STATES.After consulting the American Ambassador in London throxigh the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the War Cabinet have offered the post of head of the British Mission in the United States to Lord Northcliffe, who has accepted it. Mr. Page considers his Lordship particularly qualified to carry out the duties of this post. Lord Northcliffe will have no diplomatic duties or authority, but will refer to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington for any diplomatic assistance he may require.Mr. Balfour, telegraphing from Halifax on 3rd June, observed that in the matter -of naval and military missions, Colonel House had expressed the opinion to Sir
C. Spring Rice that it would be safer not to send special British officers unless ih&amp; 13epa.rtir.ents concerned have previously been consulted and expressed their willingness. Colonel House thinks that the best course would be to invite United States officers to come to London to represent the War and Navy Departments, and simultaneously to offer to detach corresponding British officers for similar service in the United States. He also points out that as regards sending special officers, England and France do not stand upon the same footing. The position is extremely delicate and the President highly sensitive with regard to anything that might lend colour to the idea of a &quot; British war.&quot; Should the British Government send anyone in a position corresponding to that occupied by M. Tardieu, it should be done as quietly and discreetly as possible, and the duties of the post should be strictly confined to exercising control over British officers. The position of any very prominent person would probably soon be rendered untenable as the result of Press attacks and the United States Governments necessary attitude of detachment. Sir C. Spring Rice concurs in the opinions expressed by Colonel blouse and lays stress on the necessity incumbent on British agents to pursue a policy of discreet propaganda&apos; and unobtrusive counsels. The only way in which the war can be made popular in the United States is to represent it as an American war for American ideals and purposes.It has been.arranged at a conference between the Secretary of the Treasury, Sir R. Crawford and M. Tardieu, that for the purchase of military supplies by the Allies in the United States an inter-Allied body, invested with full powers, will be constituted in London or Paris as soon as possible to frame a programme of all Allied requirements and to determine their limitations and order of priority in accordance with the shipping facilities available. The United States Government will be repre-sented on this Commission. It is understood that the present purchasing machinery of the Allies in the States will be retained, but contracts will not be signed by Messrs. Morgan, and the existing arrangements with that firm will be revised.It has been proposed to the State Department that the United States Government should be permanently represented on the Rationing Committee in London ; arrange-ments are being made to select and send delegates for the purpose. At the same &quot;time the State Department intends to establish a technical mission in London with reference to war trade questions of all kinds.On 2nd June Sir C. Spring Rice announced that the Export Restrictions Bill would probably be passed within the next few days and that the President would thereupon prohibit all exports to Scandinavia, Spain, and Holland except under licence.Sir C. Spring Rice has forwarded a report (5th June) on the present position of the Irish question in the United States. The great bulk of Americans are sick and weary of it and would be heartily relieved ,to see it settled. On the other hand, a. large number of persons of Irish descent and American politicians look on the question and hatred of England as matters of political livelihood and power. Many of the lower Catholic clergy are of this way of thinking, but the higher clergy advocate an amicable settlement without separation from Great Britain. The majority of Americans see no reason why a Convention elected ad hoe should not agree upon a settlement in which the minority would receive effective guarantees against religious, financial, or fiscal oppression.THE SHIPPING SITUATION.It appears to be the general opinion in Scandinavian shipping circles that Germany&apos;s offer of a safe conduct for neutral vessels to return home from United Kingdom ports on 1st July is intended to placate neutral and particularly Swedish public opinion, irritated by recent manifestations of German frightfulness. The offer is believed, to be genuine, so far as.it goes, and to conceal no malevolent designs on neutral shipping. In this connection Sir E. Howard has been instructed to point out to the Swedish Government that, in order to benefit by this offer, it will be to their advantage to send over as many ships as possible before the 1st July. Before granting clearances on that date, His Majesty&apos;s Government will, however, require assurances that the German safe conduct does not involve any undertakings by those concerned, restricting them from trading with the Allies.Norwegian owners of sailing ships have asked that the vessels when proceeding in ballast from Norway to load coal southwards from. Hampton Roads, may receive
direct sailing certificates from His Majesty&apos;s Consuls in Scandinavia and be exempted from calling at Halifax en route. They point out that Halifax is an impossible port for sailing sbips in winter and in summer it entails a loss of about six weeks.The Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association, in consultation with the Norwegian Government, have now submitted formal proposals for an arrangement by virtue of which, if the details of the scheme are accepted, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be in a position to requisition on time-charter the tonnage available over and above Norway&apos;s home trade requirements. The Association, or other body appointed by the Norwegian Government, will refuse to charter vessels to any other than allied countries, and will be protected in so doing by a law which is expected to come into force at once. Steps have also been taken to requisition ships laid up in Norwegian ports.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.The pronouncements as to terms of peace made by the Hungarian and Austrian groups of Social Democratic delegates who recently visited Stockholm have been published in the Press. Both programmes are substantially identical in demanding peace without annexation or indemnities, and woidd restore the independence of Belgium and Serbia (the latter being given free access to the sea), set up an inde-pendent Poland, and otherwise settle national questions by autonomy within the .Austro-Hungarian Empire. Both formulate a number of general demands as to freedom of the sea, the open door in all Colonial possessions, internationalization of canals and straits, disarmament, &amp;c. There are characteristic differences in details. The Hungarians would prefer a Poland which should include all Polish districts, and think Alsace-Lorraine might be settled by agreement between French and German Socialists. The Austrians are less precise on these .questions which touch German interests, but, on the other hand, lay more definite stress on Jugoslav autonomy than might be quite palatable to their Hungarian colleagues, and begin their pronounce-ment with a statement of the Middle European point of view, which is that the various nationalities of Central and South Eastern Europe are too mixed to make the creation of separate nation states possible.An announcement by the Hungarian Press Bureau states that Government circles in Hungary are indignant at the pronouncement of the Hungarian Socialists as being much too favourable to the Entente.A recent number of the &quot; Neue Freie Presse&quot; declared that Austria-Hungary desired no expansion of territory, except Mount Lovchen above Cattaro, which she must have to secure her shipping in the Adriatic, but that she must take over Serbian and Roumanian rights of control over the navigation of the Danube.The Austrian Prime Minister recentty assured a Ruthenian (now significantly called Ukranian) delegation that there would be no cession of territory in Eastern Galicia or Bukovina, and that the Government was resolved to cousider the needs for development of the Ukrainian people.An obviously inspired telegram from Berlin to the &quot;New York Times &quot; affords interesting explanation of the willingness of the German Government to allow Socialists to attend the Stockholm Conference. To send these delegates seemed to the Government the best way to convince them that the Entente delegates are merely the irreconcilable agent-) of their irreconcilable Governments. Thus Scheidemann himself is expected to see that his fantastic dream of a peace without annexation or indemnities is a will-o&apos;-the-wisp ; once he is converted to the truth that a German victory over England is the one essential condition for peace, his &quot;noble gift of oratory&quot; should suffice to bring it home to Russia. The &quot; Ivolnische Zeitung&quot; speeds the delegates on their way with cold comfort, telling them not to expect much from a Conference to which the emissaries of the Western Powers will come with quivers full of poisoned arrows ; &quot; only as representatives of Germany victorious will they stand upon firm ground.&quot; The Junker Press as a whole regards the Stockholm gathering with obvious misgivings and declares that its programme is full of traps.Opinion as to the possible results of the Conference is becoming more and more . sharply divided in the Allied countries, and particularly in France.   M. Thomas, whose opinions, communicated from Russia, have carried great weight with the War -Cabinet in London, has been unable to convince M. Ribot and the French Government3209-1 OB
that French and British Socialists should attend the Conference at all costs. In a. telegram addressed to Mr. Lloyd George (31st May) M. Thomas declared his eonvic-tion that the effect on Russian Socialists would be deplorable if the Germans were-present at Stockholm and Great Britain and France unrepresented. Unless the French Government refused him permission, he was determined to attend the Conference himself, for he was convinced that the war aims of the Allies might, by agreement, be revised in such a way as to conciliate Russian opinion and to rectify by explanation the formula &quot; no annexations, no indemnities.&quot; The present decision of the French Government not to grant facilities to French Socialists to go to Stockholm is likely to accentuate and define the differences between those who believe in the possibility of converting Germany to democratic principles and pacifism by means of a Conference, and those who regard the Russian Socialist formulas as dangerous folly. Mr. Branting, for example, expressed the belief in an article in the &quot; Social Demokraten &quot; (31st May) that the adhesion of French Socialism to the principles enunciated, by the Russian Government must lead to a strong demand within the Entente for a revision of its own war aims and for the elimination of Imperialistic tendencies. In his opinion it was bound to affect England and Belgium.The British Governments policy as regards the representation of British Socialism at the Conference has been chiefly directed towards preserving with France a solid front and united action ; thus the original refusal to issue passports for Stockholm was based on the French Governments initiative ; the American Government followed suit. The French Governments latest decision (reversing the policy advocated by M. Thomas) combined with the evidence of strong opposition in England (more particularly that of the Seameids and Firemeids Union), may possibly lead to a further reconsideration of British policy.Meanwhile the latest proclamation of the Council of workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates, published in the British Press of 6th June, declares that the essential task of the. Stockholm Conference is to terminate the &quot; party truce &quot; between Socialists and the Invperialist classes and governments, in other words to substitute a general class v-ar for the Avar betAveen nations, and demands that the decisions of the Conference shall be unfailingly carried out by all Socialists who attend it. This astounding declaration has put the Socialist and Labour representatives of the Allies in Petrograd in a difficult position, and Messrs. Henderson, Thomas, and Vandervelde have agreed that further information must be secured, and that it is desirable to hold an Allied Conference in London, before the Stockholm. Conference, to prepare a common policy and settle the conditions of participation. Their joint letter to the Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; delegates is noAV published in the London press. After expressing surprise at the Councirs unbusinesslike and somewhat discourteous methods of procedure, the signatories reiterate their agreement with the formula of &quot; no annexations and no indemnities,&quot; on the express condition that it does not exclude the liberation of territories in accordance with the Avish of the inhabitants nor reparation for the damage done to invaded territories. The letter adds that it will not be possible to think of common action with the German Socialists until they publicly declare their rupture with the Kaiser and aggressive Imperialism.M. Thomas has been placed in a difficult position by M. ribot&apos;s declaration, and has offered to resign.ML Troelstra, the Dutch Socialist Leader at Stockholm, is reported in a Radical Hungarian paper (&quot; A Vilag &quot;) as having declared that, not only must the Conference determine the conditions of peace, but it must devise means to compel belligerent Governments to accept them ; in other Avords, &quot; international &quot; Socialism must be organised to force a German peace upon the Avorld.There have been persistent rumours of. pourparlers for a separate peace by and with Turkish notables and officials in Switzerland. Rifa Pasha is iioav at Berne, and Enver Bey, second in command of the &quot; Goeben,&quot; is at Zurich. A Moslem Albanian official, lately returned to Berne from Vienna, reports that Taalat Basha recently warned the German Government that Turkey must make peace, and that he was. urged to hold out till the end of July.An interesting meeting is reported to have taken place last Aveek at Disentis in the Canton des Grisons, between Prince Bfilow, Erzberger, the Prior of Einsiedeln,. and. the Bishop of Coire.   The Bishop is a pro-German,-who often goes to Rome,,, and probably serves as an intermediary between German Catholics and the Vatican.
GENERAL.In pursuance of a suggestion put forward by General Friedrich in January, the War Cabinet have proposed (1st J une) throrigh the Dutch Government that a meeting between British and German official representatives should be held at the Hague to settle various questions at issue in connection with the treatment of- prisoners of war and interned civilians. Lord Bertie points out, however, that in the present touchy state of public feeling in France, the idea of a personal meeting between British and German officials might create something like consternation.Complaints and reports continue to confirm the non-delivery of parcels to British prisoners in.Germany. Three soldiers recently escaped from Langen, in Hanover, state that no parcels had been issued to them since February, the official excuse being that germs for infecting cattle were being sent in French parcels. In another camp parcels were distributed once a month, the bread being therefore uneatable. The Netherlands Minister at Berlin has been requested to renew his inqtiiries.
APPENDIXtoWestern and General Report No. 19.Views of Dominion Statesmen on Peace and Annexation.Though the Representatives of the Dominion Governments have heen afforded opportunities during the recent official Consultations of expressing their views upon questions connected with the terms of Peace, it is necessary that the public utterances of oversea statesmen on these matters should not be overlooked. For the principles publicly enunciated by the exponents of Government policy may justly be regarded by the oversea peoples as those to which their Leaders are committed ; and, moreover, the expressions which the statements call forth, from those who are normally in Parliamentary opposition may serve to indicate the measure of unanimity of political thought upon questions which vitally affect the Dominions in. their relation to the world-problems of to-day.CANADA.The attitude adopted by the Prime Minister of the Dominion with regard to the Peace for which the Allied Nations are fighting has been consistent throughout all his public pronouncements, and his general position was perhaps best summed up in these words : &quot; I am satisfied, and I think the people of this country will be satisfied, to abide by the conclusion which has already been announced by the British Government, that peace will only be granted upon the condition of reparation for the past and guarantees for the future. ... I do not suppose that it woidd be possible for the resources even of the great German nation to make reparation for all the material injury that has been catised in this war. But certain reparation must come. It must come to those people in Belgium who have seen their whole country desolated and devastated .... and who by the hundred thotrsand have been dragged from their homes into practical slavery under conditions that have shocked the conscience of the whole world. . . . They must make reparation to Serbia. They must make reparation to those countries that they have devastated and desolated, and so far as may be possible . . . they ought to make reparation for the material losses suffered by those countries whose territory has not been invaded.First, there must be reparation for the past and then guarantees for the future. . . AH the sacrifices that we have made, all the blood that has been shed, all the treasure that has been poured out, would&apos; not only be in vain, but would be absolutely worse than useless, if we did not bring about a peace with such guarantees as will ensure the world against any such aggression in the future.&quot;1The Canadian Prime Minister has also shown, in a notable passage, both the limitation of British policy and, at the same time, the necessity of victory in order to establish a standard of international morality.   He said : &quot; The German people are fighting with desperation under the belief, engendered and fostered by their military autocracy, that we seek to. crush Germany and to terminate her national existence. No such purpose ever was or could be in the mind of the British people.   It is impossible to crush in that &apos;sense a nation of  70 millions.....For  the health of  Germany&apos;s soul herpeople must be taught before it ends that military aggression is neither a1 See Dominion House of Commons Debate, 22nd January 1917.
legitimate nor a profitable business enterprise; that world domination is impossible ; that treaties are sacred ; that the public conscience of the world will not permit the rape of small, weak nations, will not tolerate the horrible methods of barbarity which have characterised the jiassage of the German armies and their occupany of conquered territory ; and, finally, that there is a world conscience which commands and can arouse a force sufficient to subdue any nation which runs amok.&apos;1&apos; 1Hardly less emphatic have been the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) in his references to the necessity of fighting Germany until she is so humbled that we shall haA7e peace afterwards.2Referring to the enemy7 overtures for peace, Sir Wilfrid said &quot; The answer of the Allied nations makes it plain that they are ready, any day, to negotiate for peace on the basis of the principles for which they are fighting  namely, the absolute sacredness of treaties, respect for the integrity of small nations, no annexation of territories without consent of the people, full indemnity7 for wrong done, in so far as indemnity can cover wrong, and guarantees against future aggressions.&quot; 3Many of those in the Dominions, who have given careful thought to the issues of the War, have not been slow to perceive that though the defeat of the Allied cause might not necessarily mean the loss of independence in the case of the older countries of Europe, y7et the triumph of the enemy would almost certainly involve the loss of. national existence on the part of the Dominions.The position of Canada in such an event was clearly7 foreshadowed in a striking speech by7 the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Sir James Lougheed), when he said &quot; The fate of Canada is as much, if not more, involved in the result of this war than the fate of any of the Allies. Occupying as we do the northern half of this great continent, settled sparsely as it is, and with its development only superficially7 touched, the triumph of Germany would mean the occupation by the Teutonic Powers where the Anglo-Saxon had laid broad and deep the foundations of his civilisation.&quot; 4AUSTRALASIA.An important pronouncement was made on ISth May by Mr. Hughes as Prime Minister and Leader of the new Nationalist party  in Australia.Speaking with reference to the recent statement by7 the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons, he said : &quot; The clear and definite statement of Lord Robert Cecil that peace is impossible upon any7 basis which excludes annexation and indemnity, will be accepted throughout the Empire as expressing a policy to which every part of the Empire, and Australia especially, will most certainly subscribe.&quot; The question of indemnity7 is one that is accepted by even those who babble about peace in a world in which there is and can be no peace while the military pow7er of that nation, upon whose shoulders rests the awful gilt of provoking this dreadful war, remains unbroken. Clearly, Eelgium and Serbia are entitled to restoration and indemnity, so far as it lies within the power of mortal man to effect this.&quot; As for annexation, while the idea of territorial aggrandisement is repugnant to our ideals and our policy, yet common prudence and regard for the creation of such conditions as will make for a lasting peace, will compel the Allies to annex such territory as will safeguard the future of civilisation.&quot;It is perfectly obvious, for example, that we cannot contemplate peace that would mean a restoration to Germany of an opportunity to create, at our very doors, means for further onslaughts upon Australia. The destiny of Australasia depends upon the control of the Pacific being in the hands of the Empire and its Allies:&quot;1 See Speech before Empire Parliamentary Association, 2nd April 1917. 2 Speech at &quot;Napanee, September 1915.3 See message to &quot; Canadian Liberal Monthly,&apos;&apos; January 1917. 4 See Speech on the Address in the Senate, January 1917. 3209-1 P
The reference to the control of the Pacific is illustrative of the deep interest taken by the statesmen of Australia and New Zealand in this vital question. That the attitude of the Commonwealth Government has the full support of the business com-munity, was shown at the Congress of the Australian Chambers of Commerce in March last, when it, was resolved strongly to resist any proposal to hand back the German islands in the Pacific on the ground that such a step would be opposed to the interests and safety of the Commonwealth and of New Zealand.So far as Australia is concerned, it was as far back as 1883 that Queensland wished to annex part of New Guinea, having realised the danger to her commerce if the islands opposite to Cape York and the entrance to the waterway inside the Barrier Reef were to fall into the hands of a foreign power. Though Australia protested at the time, the agreement with Germany established that country in the northern part of New Guinea, and it was not until later that the southern portions were annexed and subsequently put under the control of the Commonwealth to be administered as the Dependency of Papua. It can therefore easily be understood that Australia cannot regard with equanimity the possibility of the territory she has captured in New Guinea being restored to Germany.The statements of present-day New Zealand political leaders with regard to Samoa can also best be understood in the light of past events. The New Zealand Government proposed, in 1894, to establish a protectorate over the islands, but in contemplation of the opposition of Germany, this course was not approved. When the Anglo-German Convention of 1900 ceded the principal islands of the Samoan group to Germany, the New Zealand Premier (then Mr. R. J. Seddon) declared :--&quot; Some definite action of a forward character is required in the Pacific at the earliest opportune moment, for the surrender of Samoa has disheartened the natives in the islands, disappointed the people of Australasia, and lowered the prestige of Great Britain in this part of the world.&quot;The statesmen of New Zealand have not, however, lost sight of the fact that captured territory must be considered as an Imperial and not a local matter, and the present Minister of Finance and Leader of the Liberal Party (Sir Joseph Ward) stated, in October 1915 : &quot; It is quite true that New Zealand troops took possession of the Islands, but whatever they do now they are acting for, and are practically under the control and direction of, the Imperial authorities.&quot; At the same time, the New Zealand representatives have clearly indicated their views.   The Prime. Minister of New Zealand and Leader of the Conservative Party (Mr. W. F. Massey) stated in February last : &quot; What we hold we mean to keep for the Empire. . . In August 1914- there was no question of our taking German territory. But after what has taken place, the British people in the Pacific would not feel by any means secure if they thought that German bases were to be permitted in the Southern Hemisphere, with German warships within a clay or two&apos;s steam of our settlements.&quot; New Zealand holds Samoa, and means to retain it. I am sure the Australian people feel the same with regard to the enemy islands of which they have taken possession.&quot;Sir Joseph Ward also referred to the matter with equal emphasis in January last : &quot; The fact that Germany for many years was the possessor of New Guinea and Samoa, to say nothing of other islands that have been taken, was a source of intense dissatisfaction, and now that they have been wrested by Australia and New Zealand from our unscrupulous enemy, naturally it raises the qttestion as to what their disposition is to be at the conclusion of the war.   .   .&quot; While I feel proud of the inflexible determination expressed by Great Britain and her Allies in the reply to the German peace proposals, I must say that I felt considerable regret that there was not emphasised an equally- firm and decisive negation of any possibility of a reversion of the Pacific Islands to our bitter and relentless foes.&quot; There can be nothing, in my opinion, which would raise a stronger and more determined opposition, certainly throughout Australia and New Zealand, in connection with any future peace proposals than if these important islands were not included as parts of the British Empire.&quot;
SOUTH AFRICA.The interests of South Africa mainly relate, of course, to the captured territory in &quot;German South-West and in East Africa.With reference to the former, the Union Ministers were asked to occupy such part of the country as would give them the command of Swakopmund and Luderitzbucht, and the wireless stations there or in the interior, as an urgent Imperial service. It was mentioned, however, in the despatch from the British Government of the 7th August 1914 to the Acting Governor-General : &quot; You will, however, realise that any territory now occupied must he at the disposal of the Imperial Government for purposes of an ultimate settlement at the conclusion of the War.&quot;The position of the Union Government was defined by General Botha in September 1914 when he said :  &quot; It is not our object to annex more territory, and any question concerning a change in the map will not be decided by this step. Changes in the map of the world at the termination of the war will be decided on the battlefields of Europe.&quot;This attitude was criticised by the Leader of the Nationalist Party (General Hertzog) who said : &quot; If Germany loses, then German South-West Africa will fall like a ripe fruit into the lap of Great Britain. And then, if Germany wins, will South Africa be in a position to retain German South-West Africa ? &quot;General Botha, however, stated later1: &quot; Originally I said that I was not going to German South-West Africa with the object of land-grabbing. I must, however, say that this attitude has since been considerably altered, owing to the KaiseFs telegram, in which he said:  &apos; I will not only acknowledge the independence of South Africa but I will even guarantee it, provided rebellion is started immediately.&apos; &quot; In this it is possible to detect the German desire to. possess the Union.   For this reason I feel that, so far as I am concerned, it is impossible to return the territory to the Germans.   If the  territory were given back, endless difficulty would arise.&quot;Again, General Smuts observed about the same time :  &quot;The people of South Africa must now ask themselves: &apos; Are we going to stick to this country which we have so brilliantly conquered:?,&apos; It seems as clear as noon-clay that if South-West Africa does not belong to the Union in future, the day will come when the Union will belong to German South-West Africa. If you want a peaceful development in South Africa, let us stick to what we have.&quot;Even General Hertzog subsequently declared2 that :--&quot; South Africa has first claim on the territory, provided, its people are willing to be annexed and our people are also willing it ought to be incorporated.&quot;With regard to East Africa, General Smuts took from the first a wide view of the Importance of the campaign. In November 1915 he emphasised its urgent necessity in order to complete the work of driving out the German flag from Southern Africa, and pointed out in a remarkable passage that South Africa was not protected by the Monroe Doctrine like America, by distance like Australia, by forces of reserve power like Asia, and, therefore, it was a special call and the clear duty of the Union to see territory in Southern Africa inviolate against the designs formed in a &quot; Greater - Germany.&quot;Later, General Smuts declared, on his arrival in London on 12th March 1917 : &quot; The mere suggestion that am?- part should be returned is, of course, preposterous. I shudder to think what Avould happen to the native population if any part were, returned. These people have stood by us maguificently, and our prestige in East Africa would severely suffer. The whole of South Africa, East Africa, South-West Africa, and Rhodesia would stand aghast at such an idea.&quot;1 August 1915.s 4th October 1915.
Further, General Smuts has pointed out the strategical importance of East Africa in these words :  &quot; We are now in the happy position of having a through line right from Egypt to the Cape, and we are in the position of having no clanger either on the Atlantic seaboard or the Indian seaboard to our essential sea-communications-as an Empire. AVhat will happen to these communications after the settlement nobody knows. But I hope it will be borne in mind that East Africa gives us not only this through-line communication, from one end of the continent to the other, but that East Africa also ensures to us the sea road round the Cape, and also the sea road through the Bed Sea.&quot;In the light of the foregoing utterances, special significance is attached to the following extract from a recent Speech delivered by General Smuts, viz. :  &quot; It is not only Europe wediave to consider, but the future of the great Common-wealth to which we all belong.   This Commonwealth is peculiarly constituted. It is scattered over the whole world.   It is not a compact territory and it is. dependent for its very existence on world-wide communications communi-cations which must be maintained or this Empire goes to pieces.&quot; In the years of peace behind us we see what has happened. Everywhere on your communications Germany has settled down; everywhere on your com-munications you will find a German colony or a German settlement, small or large ; and the day might come when you would be in jeopardy through your lines of communication being cut.&quot; One of the by-products of the war has been that the whole world outside of Europe has been cleared of the enemy. Germany has been swept from all the seas and all continents except Central Europe. While Germany has been gaining ground in Central Europe, from all the rest of the world she has been swept clear. You are now in this position, that once more you can consider the problem of your future as a whole.&quot; When peace comes to be made you have all these cards in your hand, and you can go carefully into the question of what is necessary for your future security and the future safety of the Empire, and you. can say what you are going to keep and what you are going to give away. I hope that when the time comes  I am speaking for myself, and expressing nobod.y&apos;s opinion but my own  when the time comes for peace to be made we shall bear in mind not only Central Europe, but the whole British Empire.&quot;As far as we are concerned, we do not wish this war to have been fought in vain. We have not fought for material gain or for territory, but we have fought for security in the future. If we attach any value to this group of nations which composes the British Empire, then in settling the terms of peace we shall have to look to its future security and safety. I hope that no arrangement will be made which will jeopardise the valuable results which have been attained.&quot;21 May 1917.2 See &quot; Times,&quot; 16th May 1917.
