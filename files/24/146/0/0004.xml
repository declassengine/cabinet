SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT, No. 4.Canada.All the paragraphs in this weeks report illustrate the remarkable development of Canada&apos;s financial and industrial strength.Australia.The new Coalition Government is a very strong combination, both in parliament and in administration. Its greatest difficulty will be in the Senate where the &quot;official &quot; Labour Party still has a majority, which it apparently means to use to the utmost.Nrw Zealand.The anxiety of the people of New Zealand that their division should not be in second line on the day of Armageddon is thoroughly characteristic.Germany and America.The Germans are evidently most anxious to play up to American public opinion by conciliatory treatment of the American delegates on the Relief Commission, and the pro-German press correspondents who have stayed on in Germany are busily sending out wireless messages describing the cordial relations of Mr. \V hillock and the other delegates with the German authorities. The same conciliatory attitude is shown by the consent of the Central Powers to the War Prisoners&apos; Aid Society continuing its work even if America goes to war.France and Italy.As pointed out in last week&apos;s appreciation, Germany probably counts more upon the indirect consequences of the submarine campaign upon the relations between the Allies than, upon any -possibility of actually starving us out. The reality of the danger in that direction, and the need for the most drastic reductions in our own consumption in order to leave us free to assist our Allies, are strikingly emphasised by the Franco-Italian coal, crisis which is threatening to bring GJ-reat Britain, France, and Italy all at loggerheads with one another.German Internal Conditions.The shortage of German rolling stock has made itself felt in a variety of directions, more particularly in connection with the export of coal to Switzerland and Scandinavia. It is not clear, however, how far it arises from sheer depreciation of line and rolling stock, or how far it is due to German efforts to reorganise their traffic with a view to yet further increasing the mobility of: their armies in the coming campaign.   One
idea seems to be to divert all the civilian traffic as far as possible to the rivers and canals, and leave the railways free for military traffic. Meanwhile, all leave from the Western Front has been stopped for several weeks to ease the congestion of military traffic.Greece.The abandonment of M. Jonnart&apos;s proposed special mission to Athens, coupled with other indications, suggests that French civil and military diplomats are once more determined to precipitate a crisis. King Constantine, on the other hand, would appear to be more anxious to find a modus vivendi with the Entente, and there are rumours of an. impending change of Government. Meanwhile the starvation of Greece, both Royalist and Venizelist, is imminent, and the difficulties in the way of providing a solution are no nearer being overcome. If there are riots they are more likely, in the present exasperated state of the Greek people, to be directed against Venizelists and the Entente subjects than against the Royalist authorities.China.The intervention of Liang C&apos;hi-ch&apos;ao in the diplomatic negotiations regarding C.hina&apos;s contemplated rupture with germany would, in view of his antecedents he was for many years a refugee in Japan appear to justify the conclusion that an agreement has been arrived at between the Chinese and Japanese Governments, probably on the basis that Japan should support Ch..ina&apos;s claims to derive financial benefits from joining the Allies, and to have a seat at the Peace Conference, in return for Chinese acquiescence in Japanese plans in Shantung.The proposal that Chinese troops should, be allowed to obtain access to the foreign concessions in order to deal with enemy subjects is no doubt only a pretext in order to secure a footing in the concessions, where the Chinese authorities have always been endeavouring to assert.their claims to jurisdiction and taxation. The authorities in the foreign concessions should have no difficulty in dealing with enemy subjects themselves.L. S. A.22nd February 191.7.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.CANADA.From Press reports it appears that the Dominion House of Commons before its adjournment adopted the Resolution of the Finance Minister authorising the Govern-ment to borrow $100,000,000 to meet maturing obligations. The Minister stated that he had not in mind the immediate flotation of a loan, but that he would have to consider before long the raising of money, some of which, owing to the exchange situation, it might be desirable to borrow in the United States. Sir Thomas White further pointed out that it would be necessary for the Dominion to borrow -$250,000,000 for war expenditure on the Canadian side during the coming year, and sums in addition to establish credits in Canada for Great Britain. Balancing the advances made hj Canada for munitions against the sums owing by the Dominion in connection with oversea troops, he estimated that Great Britain was indebted to Canada to the extent of 118,000,000. ^ ;;The Hon. Secretary of the Canadian Patriotic Fund reports that the voluntary support has been so good that the Fund is able to grant supplementary assistance to 70,000 families in Canada who have sent men to the front. About -1,000,000Z. has been already subscribed, and the income exceeds the 250,000Z. a month which it is necessary to provide.The Dominion Minister of Naval Service has suggested the construction in Canada of seaplanes for scouting off the coast and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the opinion of the Admiralty is sought on the subject.The importance of proceeding with the work of construction of trawlers and drifters is recognised. Orders have been given for the necessary timber and steel, and a meeting of shipbuilding representatives has been summoned. The Admiralty have supplied drawings and information as to the dimensions.The opinion of the Canadian Government has been sought upon the view of the Russian Government that 100,000 volunteers could be recruited from the Polish colony in the United States if organised in national units.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Mr. Hughes has succeeded in the formation of a Coalition Government, consisting of the following : Prime Minister and Attorney-General.     - The Right Hon. W. M. Hughes (Labour).Minister for the Navy - - The Right Hon. Joseph Cook (Liberal).Minister of Defence     - - - The Hon. G. F. Pearce (Labour).Treasurer - The Right Hon. Sir J. Forrest (Liberal).Postmaster-General     - - The Hon. W. Webster (Labour).Minister for Home Affairs and Territories The Hon. P. McM. Glynn (Liberal).Minister for Customs   - - - The Hon. .1. A. Jensen (Labour).Minister for Works and Railways - &quot;The Hon. W. A. Watt (Liberal).Vice-President of the Executive Council - The Hon. E. D. Milieu (Liberal).Assistant Minister    - - - The Hon. E. G. Russell (Labour).Assistant Minister       - - The Hon. L. E. Groom (Liberal).It will be seen that the Cabinet is nearly equally divided between the Liberal supporters of Mr. Cook (hitherto Leader of the Opposition) and the Labour supporters of Mr. Hughes. Mr. Tudor will no doubt assume the Leadership of the Opposition with the bulk of the Labour Party behind him. The position of the Government will depend very much upon the attitude of the Senate, as the supporters of Mr. Tudor in the Upper House outnumber those of the Coalition.In reply to the telegram from Sir William Robertson suggesting the formation of a sixth Australian Division, the Commonwealth Government agree to the proposal but would like to see one to three infantry brigades formed first. They point out that the additional Division can be formed from men now serving with, the colours, and on the assumption of 18,500 casualties a month, it would be possible to maintain the Division for four months from the forces at present in hand. After this, reinforce-ments could be provided for three further months from the men now being recruited at the rate of about 5,090 per month. The total number of men sent from Australia to the present date amounts to 2S6,950.With reference to the sale of the 1916-17 Australian wheat crop for 18,000,000?., payable in nine weekly instalments from the 1st February, the Prime Minister of the
* See ulno under &quot; Ceylon.&apos;&apos;&quot;Commonwealth states that all advances to farmers have been arranged, but that only one instalment has hitherto been paid. He hopes that further delay will not.occur. In reply the Secretary of State has stated that the Treasury will make regular payments of the instalments. He has also explained that while it is not intended to withdraw from the arrangement made, it has been.necessary to utilise ships for other purposes than wheat transport. This will entail a longer period for the shipment of the amount purchased than that originally contemplated.The Commonwealth government have acceded to the req uest to release as many Australian coasting vessels as possible for ocean traffic, and have promised to examine the present work of each vessel with this object.The Secretary of State has informed the Australian Government^&apos; that in order to meet naval, military, and economic requirements in view of the submarine menace, it has become necessary to reduce imports into the United Kingdom by 500,000 tons a month. This will involve further restrictions regarding paper and prohibition regarding soft timber and raw fruit (with certain exceptions). Coffee and rum will be totally prohibited, and tea, cocoa, wine, brandy, leather and hides, restricted. The Secretary of State expresses the hope that, notwithstanding the promise previously made that fresh fruit produced within the British Empire should be exempted from any prohibitions, the Dominions will acquiesce in the proposals in view of the changed conditions. -New South Wales.Parliament has been dissolved and. the General Election will be completed in March. &apos;-. , -&quot;NEW ZEALAND.In response to a telegram of enquiry from the Secretary of State as&apos;: to the formation and training of new units, the New Zealand Government telegraphed on the 1.5th February that it is not possible to organise another infantry brigade, with other arms, ia readiness to sail by June. If this should be required by July it is suggested that it might be made up from reinforcements now in England, provided that the further reinforcements to be sent are used to maintain the New Zealand Division. There are about 54,000 fit men in. New Zealand to be drawn on for general service, and with those now in camp the Dominion can maintain its Division till the end of next year. If the new units are formed as suggested from troops now in the United Kingdom, the Government hope that there is no chance of their Division being so depleted that it might have to be withdrawn and thus prevented from taking-part in the final and probably most historic battle, of the War. This would be an intense disappointment to the New Zealand people.The Governor points out in his telegram that New Zealand has sent 13 per cent, of her male population for expeditionary service. The present commitments bring the percentage to 17 for the present year, irrespective of the territorial force and. cadet units. He adds that the proportion of the male population available ill the Dominion is not as great as in the United Kingdom for various reasons stated.The Secretary of State has advised the New Zealand Government that the French Government is against the compulsory employment of interned civilians on account of the certainty of retaliatory measures being employed.SOUTH AFRICA.General Smuts, in the course of a speech at Cape Town on the 14-th February (reports of which have been telegraphed to the Press), declared that South Africa had secured a voice in the disposal of the African continent.In order to stimulate recruiting for the labour corps amongst the natives, the Government suggest that about 20 leading natives should be returned to South Africa in order that they may inform their people as to the conditions of employment in France. Failing this, it is suggested that a representative delegation of natives should be sent to France to see the conditions, and on their return it is believed they would be able to reassure their various tribes.RHODESIA.It appears from enquiries made that a further contingent of 500 natives can be raised.
CEYLON.*The Governor of Ceylon lias been informed that, under the new scheme of&quot; &quot;restriction of imports foreign tea will be excluded altogether, and Ceylon and Indian tea will be reduced to 120,000 tons per annum. Of this, the proportion of Ceylon will be 30 per cent, and India 70 per cent. Foreign cocoa will also be excluded and. British cocoa reduced by 50 per cent, of 1916 imports.PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.BELGIUM.The Netherlands Government, have readily agreed to table  charge of British interests in Belgium.On the 14th February His Majesty&apos;s representative at Washington was instructed to suspend till further notice the issue of safe-conducts to Belgian relief ships, this measure being necessitated by the German obstacles to their navigation. The National Committee in Belgium has been compelled, as a precautionary step, to reduce the food rations in the occupied provinces. The Belgian Government have appealed to the King of Spain to intervene with the German Emperor in the hope-that arrangements may be restored for the traffic of the relief ships.In view of the probability that the American delegates will ultimately be compelled1 to abandon their work on the Relief Commission, His Majesty&apos;s Government, acting in concert with the French and Belgian Governments, have taken preliminary steps to invoke the protection of the King of Spain on behalf of the population of the-invaded provinces. Sir A. Hardinge lias been directed to ascertain His Majesty&apos;s wishes in regard to the possible future personnel of the Relief Commission. If, as-appears probable, it becomes necessary to replace the entire American organisation for purchases, transport, and finance, His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that it will be generally advantageous to have the detailed administrative work performed (wherever Belgians cannot function) by an exclusively Dutch personnel, composed of men -who possess intimate knowledge and experience of the conditions in Belgium. In that case the identification of Spain with the work of the Commission would be secured by entrusting the Spanish representatives at Brussels, London,.and the Havre with the presidency over all its international relations. As matters stand, however, the Germans have officially announced their willingness to allow the American delegates to continue their relief work. (Mr. Hoover considers acceptance of this proposal inadvisable.) The German wireless of the 20th February declares that Mr. Whitlock will remain at Brussels with the cordial apjproval of Yon Bissing; that his flag was never hauled down or his work interfered with, but a message of the 21st qualifies this by suggesting that he may remain in a purely philanthropic capacity.FRANCE AND ITALY.As reported in the Summary for the week ending 7th February, His Majesty&apos;s Government had then represented to the French Government the serious position of affairs produced in Italy by the shortage of coal, and asked their consent to with-drawing 100,000 tons of shipping from the French service in order to supply Italian requirements. In view of the increasing seriousness of the situation, Lord Bertie-was directed (1 7th February) to make further urgent representations to the French Government. The latter&apos;s reply declares it to be absolutely impossible to comply with the proposal to divert any tonnage from France to Italy and &quot; demands in the &quot; most formal manner that the allocation of neutral tonnage arranged by the Inter-&quot; Allied Freight Bureau in London (3rd December) shall not be modified to the &quot; detriment of France on account of Italian coal crisis.&quot; Lord Bertie continues, nevertheless to urge further consideration of the problem.The Italian Governments position in regard to this matter has been officially expressed by the statement that, unless something&apos; can be done promptly to improve the situation, there can be no question of an Italian offensive and even defensive operations will be paralysed.* The Gold Coast, Jamaica, and British Guiana have also been informed. See also under Australian Comrno uw ealth.
2 r-JINTERNAL CONDITIONS OF GERMANY.The following information, obtained from reliable neutral sources, has been received during the past week : The German Government have informed the Swiss Government confidentially that, owing to shortage of rolling stock, it will not be possible to deliver to Switzerland the stipulated monthly supplies of coal.Mr. Hoover, of the American Relief Commission, considers that Germany&apos;s food supplies will suffice to meet the needs of the Army, the farmers and persons engaged in Government employment, until nest harvest. The rest of the population will be underfed, but not starved.The general impression in German official circles is that England cannot be starved by the submarine blockade, but that such injury can be inflicted upon her mercantile marine as to give Germany an advantage over it after the war.According to Herr Ballin there will be no more Zeppelin raids.SWITZERLAND.The Swiss Government have informed Sir II. Rumbold that the Swiss Minister at Washington was not instructed to make any official communication, either verbal or written, to the United States Government as to negotiations between the German and United States Governments concerning the German submarine campaign. They were much surprised by the United States State Departments communique on the subject.GREECE.The situation in Greece continues to present features of a nature to create uneasiness. On 14th February General Cariboue had occasion to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that on both sides of the Corinth Canal, shafts had been sunk &quot;and mine chambers prepared, with the obvious intention of blocking the Canal ; this work had been in progress for three months and was nearly complete. Neither valid explanation nor enquiry was forthcoming. On the same day Sir F. Elliot had a thoroughly unsatisfactory conversation with the Prime Minister concerning the dissolution of the Reservists&apos; Leagues, the surrender of arms and the proposed general amnesty. On the 16th the Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted that the Government proposed to release short-term convicts because the number of guards left by the Powers was insufficient for the guarding of all prisoners. Recognition of these and other similar facts probably influenced M. Jonnart in his decision not to undertake the duties of Special Ambassador to Athens. On the 15th he informed the Greek Committee in Paris that in his opinion diplomatic negotiation, with the King of Greece could serve no useful purpose, as His Majesty would only be influenced by &quot;the result of military operations.On the 15th, the threatening attitude of the Reservists had produced something like a state of panic at Athens, so much so that on the following clay the French representative informed the Prime Minister that, if any disturbances occurred, the French fleet would bombard Athens (with shells which would burst this time), and that, in any such event, the Allies would regard themselves as freed from their undertaking not to support a Venizelist movement. His Majesty&apos;s representative in Paris was instructed to urge that the French Admiral be instructed not to bombard Athens unless and until an agreement on the subject had been reached by the Allied Governments ; at the same time instructions were given to Sir F. Elliot, in concert with his colleagues, to warn the Greek Government that unless the King and his advisers can maintain law and order, the guaranteeing Powers will be obliged to shape their policy accordingly. In a joint Note communicated by the British, French and Russian Ministers to the Press (17th February) stress was laid on the grave responsibility which the Royalist Government were incurring by allowing the excesses of its Press to continue unchecked,. (It is interesting to note that, in the opinion of the&apos; Italian Minister, the Reservist Leagues represent the opinion of the country.)A first list of Royalists detained by the Venizelists as hostages has been forwarded by the Greek Government to Sir F. Elliot and by him referred to Lord Granville. It includes four metropolitans, a Bishop, 2-1 deputies, 59 officials, 194 non-commissioned officers, &amp;o, &amp;c.   Discussing the matter with Lord Granville on the 19th February,2464-4 B
M. Venizelos said lie was convinced the list was greatly exaggerated ; in any case, he-considers the situation at Athens to be very dangerous and will not release his. hostages except as part of a bargain.As regards the question of the raising of the blockade, the Allied representatives (the Italian Minister abstaining) stated in their communique to the Press on the 18th that the guarantees stipulated by the Note of the 8th January cannot be regarded as fulfilled, and that the Military Control are by no means satisfied in regard to the surrender of arms. On the other hand, the British, Italian, and Russian delegates do not share the opinion of the French that the present condition of Thessaly is a menace to the Army at Salonika. But whether the guarantees are adequate or not, the increasing difficulty of provisioning Greece, caused by the German submarine activities, has led His Majesty&apos;s Government to discuss the advisability of raising the blockade at &quot;once, so that Germany, and not Great Britain, may bear the responsibility of the impending shortage of supplies. Lord Bertie was instructed. (20th February) to urge consideration of this aspect of the question on the French Government, and to express the opinion that it is not expedient to maintain the blockade, especially as our advisers in Greece are of opinion that the terms of the ultimatum have been substantially carried out.The difficulty of provisioning Venizelist Greece has become more sericns, partly because grain ships in American and Greek waters are delayed by reason of insurance obstacles. Lord Granville states that the present stocks will be exhausted by the end of February. The Italian Government have been requested, as a matter of critical urgency, to advance wheat against the cargoes ordered by the Venizelist authorities, but Sir R. Rodd, telegraphing on the 18th,&quot;intimated that there is no prospect of assistance from this quarter, partly because of the shortage of grain in Italy and partly because any mention of the Provisional Government is as a red rag to Baron Sonnino. Lord Granville recommends that special permission be given to import limited quantities of maize from Egypt and barley from Cyprus. Some assistance is expected from the French Government. The Wheat Commission in London point out that supplies for Greece are being seriously restricted by the-congestion in United States ports ; but the blame for this is partly attributable to the Greek Governments failure to conclude the necessary shipping arrangements.The French Government have appointed M. Ristelhueber, of the Consular Service,, as the French Member of the International Commission to deal with the compensation claims and other matters arising out of the events of 1st December.The Greek Government have warned the Turkish Consul at Janina that he must leave the country.   &apos;The Austrian has left.NETHERLANDS.Jonkheer van Vrednburch, formerly Minister at Bucharest, has been attached to the Netherlands Legation at Berlin with a special staff, to take charge of British interests. There will be four doctors for duty in connection with British, prisoners, of war.SWEDEN.Sir E. Howard has been instructed to inquire what action the Swedish Government are taking in regard to the destruction of Swedish mails on the S.S. Ingeborg by a German submarine, and to intimate that His Majesty&apos;s Government have a right to demand that reprisals should be exacted from Germany at least as severe as those meted out to Great Britain for the stoppage and censoring of Swedish mails.According to information supplied to Sir W. Townley by the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Swedish Government have suggested that the representatives of neutral countries at Stockholm should meet to consider the advisability of formally convening a Conference for the discussion of the post helium interests of neutrals. The Dutch Charge d&apos;Affairs has been authorised to take part in this preliminary discussion.His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Christiania has been informed that in framing the joint Scandinavian Note of protest against the German blockade, Sweden wished to protest simultaneously against the British mine-field, but Norway refused, to do so. In other respects the Note apparently represents a compromise between Swedish and Norwegian opinions, in which the Swedish Prime Ministers views have preponderated.The Swedish Government has assumed charge of German interests in Egypt.
NORWAY.In return for an undertaking on tile part of the Norwegian Government to cease -giving licences for the export of pyrites to Germany, His Majesty&apos;s Government have -agreed to repeal the special restrictions with regard to the export of coal from Great Britain to Norway, and to relax the general restrictions recently imposed on the clearance of Norwegian ships from British ports. It is understood that the Norwegian Governments interpretation of the copper agreement will be the subject of further examination by legal experts, and that the several subsidiary questions outstanding will be separate!y dealt with.DENMARK.His Majesty&apos;s Government, having reason to believe that the suspension of Danish shipping traffic to England has led to a considerable increase in the export of cattle and agricultural produce to Germany, have instructed Sir R. Paget to express profound dissatisfaction with the situation, and to intimate that unless it is speedily remedied strong measures will be applied.SPAIN.His Majesty&apos;s representative at Madrid has been instructed to remind the Spanish &quot;Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government have gone out of their way to allow increased coal shipments to Spain and have recently released all Spanish ships in British ports; they therefore look to the Spanish Government to reciprocate by facilitating the sailing of vessels from Spain to Allied ports.With regard to the Spanish proposal to buy German vessels interned in Spanish ports, His Majesty&apos;s Government have signified their willingness to agree to the purchase, provided that such vessels are used exclusively in the Spanish coasting trade, and that arrangements are facilitated by the Spanish Government for the purchase by His Majesty&apos;s Government of Spanish vessels of a total tonnage not less than that of the German ships thus acquired.Spanish shipowners in general are prepared to entertain the British Governments proposals to purchase their vessels ; negotiations are proceeding to acquire 30 vessels representing about 100,000 tons. The Minister of Commerce is favourably disposed, but unwilling to conclude the matter until the Cortes is closed and censorship of the Press becomes more severe.PORTUGAL.The programme for the embarkation and transport to France of Portuguese troops, -arranged by the British Naval authorities, and accepted by the Portuguese Govern-ment, has again been delayed, owing to the failure of the Portuguese officials concerned to adhere to the dates specified. Certain modifications of the programme have now been proposed (21st February) by the Portuguese Government.CHINA.Liang Ch&apos;i-ch&apos;ao (a noted scholar in close touch -with Peking politics but averse to holding office) called on His Majesty&apos;s Minister on the 17th, and intimated that the Government had decided to sever relations with Germany, but were much exercised in their minds over * the financial aspects of the situation. They consider that preparations to meet that situation will involve them in considerable expense, and therefore suggest that the Allied Governments should consent to suspension of the Boxer Indemnity payments and to an increase in the Customs tariff. They have also requested that, in order to facilitate dealing with enemy subjects whenever necessary, the rule be suspended which excludes Chinese troops from the foreign concessions at Tientsin, Hankow and other ports.The Chinese Minister at Tokio has asked the advice of the Japanese Government as to the best moment for severing relations with Germany. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, after consultation with the representatives of France, Russia and Great Britain (18th February), advised His Excellency that the matter should be delayed as little as possible, and added that when relations had actually been severed he would be prepared to invite the Allied Governments to give favourable consideration to China&apos;s246-1- -i 0
requests in regard to the Indemnity and Customs questions. As regards the question?, of further financial assistance, which has been mooted, he thought this might be-considered if and when China was prepared to take an active part in the Avar.Mr. Alston reports (19th February) the successful arrangements for. recruiting in. Shantung, organised throughout the region traversed by the Tsinanfu Tsingtao Railway. There are now 6,000 coolies awaiting shipment at the Wei-hei-wei and Tsingtao depots. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Tsinanfu confidently expects to be able to-secure up to 20,000 a month, if the necessary transport can be provided ; the present, arrangements only allow of the shipment of 7,000 men to the end of April. Mr. Alston recommends that as the depot at Tsingtao, with the assistance of the Japanese military authorities, is working well, it should be constituted an independent base for equipment and direct shipment to France, under His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Tsinanfu.The suggestion has been made, and conditionally approved by His Majesty&apos;s-Minister at Peking, that coolie recruiting for the French Government shotild be-entrusted to the British organisation in Shantung.JAPAN.Sir C. Greene was instructed on the 14th instant to inform the Japanese Govern -ment that His Majesty&apos;s Government will support Japanese claims on the occasion of a Peace Conference, in regard to the disrjosal of German rights in Shantung and possessions in the islands north of the Equator, on &quot;the understanding that Great Britain&apos;s claims in regard to the German islands south of the Equator will be similarly supported by Japan.Sir C. Greene reports that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has suggested that the services of Dr. Morrison (adviser to the Chinese Government) at Peking should he used to press the Chinese Government towards an immediate rupture with. Germany.S! AM.A Swiss firm lias proposed that their branch at Bangkok should be commissioned&apos; to purchase the nine German steamers in that port on. behalf of His Majesty&apos;s-Government or of a British firm.The instructions issued by the French Government to their representative at Bangkok indicate a desire that the Siamese Government should, respond to the American Note by action similar to that taken by the Chinese Government. His Majesty&apos;s representative is, however, of the opinion that no good purpose, would be served by urging the Siamese Government to an immediate rupture with Germany,, and that a policy of inaction is advisable for the present. The German Note was not addressed to Siam.The Siamese Minister having threatened to withdraw gold from the Bank of England and send it to America, and actually demanded payment of 150,000?., instructions were sent (21st February) to His Majesty&apos;s representative at Bangkok to-state that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard such action as extremely unfriendly, and to ask that the Siamese Government instruct their Minister to desist from the-demand.MEXICO.The Mexican Press is practically unanimous in expressing the opinion that a state of Avar betAveen the United States and Germany must involve Mexico. Mr. Thurstan considers it extremely probable that President Carranza would, in that event, take-the German side. The Brazilian &quot;Minister at Washington has informed Sir C. Spring-rice that Carranza&apos;s proposals to stop the shipment of oil, foodstuff and materials to-belligerents were certainly inspired by Germany and seriously meant. Mr. Thurstan. advises a policy of Avatchful waiting, and considers it possible that the insurrection under Pelaez may speedily develop proportions which will confine Carranza&apos;s attention to domestic affairs.The Japanese Ambassador in London has unofficially informed, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that no relations of interest exist betAveen Japan and Mexico-of a nature to justify the suspicions unfortunately prevalent in, the United States.
CUBA.His Majesty&apos;s representative at Havana reports thai; the revolution is gaining in strength. The Government does not attribute it to German instigation, as Washington does. The United States Government have formally proclaimed their support of the Constitutional Government.VENEZUELA.The Governments reply to President Wilsons Note says that, as Germany did not communicate with Venezuela in the matter of its submarine blockade, there is no call for the Government to take any action in the matter.ECUADOR.The Government have proposed that a Conference of the South American Republics should be convened at Montevideo to consider measures for the protection of the rights of neutrals.UNITED STATES.Sir C. Spring Rice learns on reliable authority that the United States Government have during the past few days acquired an apparatus whereby the exact position of submarines can be located within a radius of 4 miles.The recent German overtures made through the Swiss Minister were merely for propagandist purposes and in connection with the intrigues of Air. Bryan with the German Ambassador.   These last have made a deep impression.The United States Government apprehends the possibility of a serious outbreak by Germans and. other malcontents in New York, and measures are being taken to cope with it on a large scale.&apos;GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.According to the German Wireless, the effect of the increased activity of submarines has been to paralyse the mercantile shipping of the Allies, and particu-larly in respect of the trade to and from Holland and Scandinavia. Messages purporting to give information from the Scandinavian Press on the 19th and 20th February assert for example (I) that Norwegian shipowners have been unable to induce their crews to sail, and that all passenger traffic to America is at a standstill ; (2) that there is no prospect of any Danish export steamer leaving for England in the near future ; and (3) that traffic between Sweden, and America has been resumed, ships following the safe route north of the Faroe Islands &quot; outside the danger zone carefully defined by Germany.&quot;The situation as regards Scandinavian shipping undoubtedly leaves much to be desired ; all three countries have intimated that traffic is not likely to be satisfactorily restored unless (I) escorts or a protected route in the North Sea can be provided by the British Admiralty and (2) arrangements can be made for effecting insurance in the United Kingdom. His Majesty&apos;s Government are conducting intricate negotiations in the several countries concerned with a view either to acquiring neutral ships or to inducing them to continue trading to Allied ports ; meanwhile there is much congestion of passengers (including refugees), cargo and postal matter in Norway, a considerable accumulation of shipping at Bergen, Copenhagen and other ports, and a serious diminution in the export of Danish agricultural produce to Great Britain.His Majesty&apos;s Governments representatives in neutral countries have been directed to communicate to the Press the actual figures of shipping entries and clearances at ports in the United Kingdom, excluding coast traffic, during the period 1st to 14thx February (entries 4,777, clearances 4,514).   These show that the losses caused by sub-marines amount to less than 1 per cent, during this period of incieased frightfulness.Norwegian shipowners have been reassured by the British Governments under-taking (20th February) not to resort to compulsory requisition of their vessels ; furthermore, that ships bringing full cargoes of approved goods will be allowed to return with coal.
The Dutch shipowners have announced their readiness to maintain regular sailings to British ports subject to the condition that the protection above-mentioned is forthcoming. Meanwhile the Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir W. Townley (18th February) that the holding tip of Dutch shipping in British ports is causing much irritation in Holland.To break the blockade of Denmark, and to inspire confidence to Scandinavian shipping, Sir R. Paget has advised that some British ships be sent with coal to Bergen and there meet Danish vessels bringing produce and exchange cargoes. Sir F. Hopwood also thinks it very desirable that at the present juncture the Admiralty should take active steps to put heart into the Scandinavians, and disabuse them of the idea that Germany controls the North Sea, by regulating and protecting the passage of British ships between Scotland and Norway. In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government there are practical objections to the Bergen scheme, and Sir R. Paget has been directed to remind Danish exporters that Great Britain has offered to insure their cargoes.His Majesty&apos;s representatives at Christiania, Stockholm, and Copenhagen and the Hague have been informed of the several conditions under which His Majesty&apos;s Government are provisionally prepared to allow Atlantic trading vessels without mails or passengers to call at Halifax instead of Kirk wall for examination.The issue of the Order in Council referring to the condemnation of vessels not calling for examination, has been delayed as the result of representations from Sir C. Spring Rice and the French Ambassador at Washington. They considered the moment inopportune, owing to the sensitive condition of public opinion in the United States. His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, pointed out that the Order in Council is a necessary complement of the Halifax concession, and that the effect on neutrals would be dejdorable if the German blockade were recognised hj that concession without some counterbalancing measure on our side. Sir C. Spring Rice and his French colleague having withdrawn their objections, it was decided to issue the Order on 21st February, and Lord Bertie was instructed to express the hope that it might be simultaneoxisly published by the French Government.The Brazilian Government have informed the German Government that they will be held responsible in the event of submarine attack on three Brazilian vessels about to enter the blockaded zone. Sir C. Spring Rice reports (20th February) that several United States ships have cleared for the war zone.GENERAL.From a reliable source it is reported that German and Austrian Banks in Switzer-land are buying at a premium the Pussian banknotes which reach Switzerland from Great Britain probably for use in espionage work in Russia or Poland. It is therefore suggested that all export of Russian notes from England to neutral countries be stopped.According to information communicated by Sir E. Howard (Stockholm) on the 17th February, the Central Powers have consented to the War Prisoners&apos; Aid Society continuing its work in Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria, even if America goes to war. The Rockefeller organisation, which handles stores for prisoners in all countries, proposes to charter a A&apos;essel to carry stores from America to Sweden, under the patronage of the Crown Princess, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have been requested to guarantee that this ship will not be required to pass through the German blockaded zone.
