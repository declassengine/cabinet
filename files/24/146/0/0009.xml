SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERAL.    REPORT No. 9.Belgium.The German partition of Belgium into a Flemish and a Walloon half is a bold step in furtherance of the policy of fostering the division between Fleming and Walloon which has been so acute from time to time in the past. Belgian statesmanship has always aimed by various devices, such as Proportional Representation, to bridge over the cleft between the two Belgian nationalities ; Germany is naturally doing all she can to reopen it and make it permanent. It is not impossible that Germany has in view the eventuality of buying off France by a cession of the French-speaking Walloon provinces of Belgium, retaining herself the &quot;Low-German&quot; Flemish provinces with the ports of Antwerp, Zeebrugge and Ostend.Greece.It is characteristic that the Venizelist Government should be the first to protest against Italian encroachments on Greek territory, although Epirus, the scene of the encroachments, is in Royalist Greece. Even the Royalists, however, are showing signs of alarm at the way in which their Italian friends are extending their invasion of Greek territory.General sarrail&apos;s decision to make French. paper legal tender in Salonika would appear to be part of his general policy of treating Macedonia as French territory, and will, no doubt, strengthen the general belief in Greece that French policy is aiming at the establishment of a permanent protectorate in Macedonia.Mexico and Central America.The Germans are evidently veiy active in all this region, and more is likely to be heard of them as soon as America formally declares herself at war.Germany and the United States.Judging by the wireless messages sent to the American Fress from Berlin, Germany&apos;s intention, if Congress on 2nd April declares that a state of war exists, is to take up the position that she is unaware of the fact, as she is doing nothing to America which she is not doing equally toother neutrals. Meanwhile the pro-German correspondents in Scandinavia are making a last effort to appeal to America not to abandon the smaller neutrals to their fate by joining in the war.L. S.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.At the first meeting of the Imperial War Conference general regret was expressed at the absence of Australian representatives, and the Secretary of State has informed the Governor-General of the Commonwealth to this effect. He has also informed the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of the gratification expressed by the Dominion Delegates at the representation of India for the first time.CANADA.Mr. Blondin, the Postmaster-General, is enlisting in the Overseas Forces. It is announced in the Press that instead of accepting his proffered resignation of office, the Government will grant the Minister leave of absence. Mr. Blondin is a distinguished French-Canadian, and was born in 1874.From Press telegrams it appears that the third War Loan has been a great success, the amount (30,000,000Z.) being oversubscribed by more than 20,000,000LThe Secretary of State has informed the Governor-General that, in pursuance of the plan already announced, it is intended to requisition those liners on the route between Canada or the United States and the Mediterranean or the United Kingdom.The Canadian Government have been informed by the Dominion wool buyers that it is impossible to obtain wool from Australia as no authority for shipment to Canada has been received from London. The Canadian Ministers therefore ask the Home Government to give the requisite permission to Australia and New Zealand.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The Australian Government have expressed their regret that the British Treasury do not agree to a greater loan issue in London than 3,500,000L It is pointed out that this places the Commonwealth in a difficult position, as they had undertaken to borrow money for the States in respect of their public works, the amount required for this purpose in 1917 being 0,840,0001As the Commonwealth has raised in Australia the sum of 79,000,0007-. for the war, and all available loan moneys will be wanted in this direction, it is suggested that the Commonwealth should be authorised to lend the States 3,000,OOOZ. from the amounts lent by the British Government for war purposes.The Governor-General reports (24th March) the following with regard to Australian troops, viz. : Number&apos; despatched Number undergoing Trainingduring February 1917. 28th February 1917.Officers. Men. Officers. Men.Reinforcements       -   151 0,528 230       -   14,191New Units -      6 532The Commonwealth Government have strongly represented the advisability&apos;&apos; of the various British Government Departments ordering goods from Australia through a single authority that which controls the amount of space on the ships being suggested as the most suitable. ,Mr. Hughes, the Prime Minister, has announced, in a public speech, the figures relating to the soldiers voting in the recent Referendum on Conscription. lie states that those in favour numbered 72,000, while those against were 58,000.SOUTH AFRICA.Considerable doubt prevails amongst the employes remaining in the mining industry as to whether they would not serve Imperial interests best by volunteering for service in Europe. As in the opinion of the Chamber of Mines the number of white employes has reached the minimum consistent with the upkeep of the present output, the Governor-General, at the request of the Chandler, and with the approval of General Bctha, has asked His Majesty&quot;s Government for an expression of opinion that
the production of: gold from British territory is of great Imperial importance. It would be proposed to publish a pronouncement of this character in order to satisfy those employes who are in doubt as to the course they should follow:In view of the representations put before them by the Army Council, the Govern-ment have decided to re-open recruiting for East Africa. They will endeavour to raise and despatch two battalions by the end of April. Ministers are of opinion that the recruiting for Europe will be affected by the course they have decided upon, but they report that since 1st January 3,000 men have enlisted for the first brigade and it is hoped to obtain 1,500 more in time to keep that Brigade goiug.GOLD COAST. &apos; .Telegrams from, the Officer Administering the Government indicate that armed natives of the probable strength of. .1,200 are in revolt. The majority of these are apparently concentrated at Senyon with the intention of attacking Bole. The telegraph wire between the last-named place and Wa has been cut. A company of the Gold Coast Regiment is being sent to Bole in order to be prepared for any eventualities. The Chief Commissioner reports that matters are quiet in Ashanti.NYASALAND.The Governor considers that. Nyasaland is placed in a dangerous position through the transference of a part of General. Northey;s Force to the south in pursuit of Wintgens, and through the considerable enemy forces which, now threaten. Songea. Illness has put, many of General North ey&apos;s troops out of action, and his present force is inadequate. As the Government of Nyasaland have no more trained troops to give him, it is suggested that he should be reinforced at once by 1,000 trained, black troops, and that a Belgian force should be moved to Bismarcksburg to prevent any -attack on Northern Rhodesia by Wintgens. The Governor points out the dangerous effect on. the native mind if Nyasaland is invaded and the forces suffer any defeat.EAST AFRICA.The Bishop of Zanzibar has made representations regarding the division of German East Africa which are based on a considerable knowledge of the country. He submits that the Bortuguese should not be permitted to cross the Rovuma River, as this would have a bad effect on the natives, who regard them as discredited in both a moral and military sense. The Bishop suggests that the country south of the Rufigi River should be kept entirely for the black man.JAMAICA. VThe Secretary of State has telegraphed that the Government have decided to admit importations of fruit grown in the British Empire up to an amount corresponding to 50 per cent. oE the imports of 1916. This arrangement is limited to the present crop ; but there will be absolute prohibition of importation after 31st duly, unless meantime the situation should have altered.PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.BELGIUM.According to a German&apos; wireless of the 21st instant, the Governor-General of Brussels has announced the creation of two administrative zones in Belgium. One, to consist of the provinces of Antwerp, Limbourg, Brabant, and East and West Flanders, will be administered from Brussels; the other, including Hainault, Liege, Luxemburg, and Namur, will be administered from Namur.
BELGIUM AND NORTHERN FRANCE. .     &quot; Relief Commission.     . V, ,     ,In view of the decision of the United States Government to withdraw all the-American delegates from relief work in Belgium and Northern France, it has become necessary for the Commission to select other delegates to replace them. A hitch has occurred, however, Owing to the fact that the Spanish Minister at Brussels (sis representative of one of the protecting Powers) has suggested the employment in Northern France of certain Spanish delegates, in-whose appointment the Commissions representatives at Brussels and Rotterdam do not concur. The German authorities-have issued the necessary passports for the Dutch delegates selected by the Commission, but withhold permission for them to proceed until the Spanish Minister shall have received his instructions from Madrid. The British and French Govern-ments are agreed that the nomination of delegates to replace the Americans rests solely with the managers of the Relief Commission. Sir A. Hardinge has accordingly been directed to request the Spanish Government to instruct their representative at, Brussels in this sense and to express the hope that the confusion arising from such conflicting appointments may be obviated. Meanwhile, as already stated, the Germans remain, in full control of relief supplies in the invaded territories. His Majesty&apos;s Government have directed Sir A. Hardinge to intimate that, unless the-Commission&apos;s chosen delegates are allowed to proceed at once to their posts, it will be necessary to stop shipments.Sir W. Townley states, on the authority of the Spanish Minister at the Hague, that the German authorities at Brussels have declared that the four Relief Commission ships-awaiting safe-conducts in British ports may leave in full secuHty on 1st May, provided: that particulars of the vessels&apos; names and ports of departure are communicated to the German Government before the 10th of April, and that the German sailing-instructions are followed. The Commission are protesting, against this postponement of safe-conducts which, at the date named, will be useless for the ships in question, as. their cargoes are deteriorating and must be discharged long before that date.ITALY.The Minister of Marine has drawn the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome to the measures taken, by the British naval and military authorities with a view to making Taranto an embarking station for British troops. Not having been, consulted in regard to these measures, he asks that they may form the subject of an official communication to the Italian Government. Sir R. Rodd, whilst requesting1 instructions on the subject, observes that the question of embarking British troops at Taranto: was dealt with by the Conference at Rome, and that every assistance has. since been rendered by the Italian authorities to the British railway mission and other-officials charged with creating the necessary establishments.Sir R. Rodd reported (24th March) that, owing to differences of opinion between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of the Interior regarding the censorship and other delicate questions, a parliamentary crisis was impending.   It was believed that, the Minister for Foreign Affairs had tendered his resignation.   A later telegram, announces, that these differences have been arranged, probably through the direct,; intervention of the King. .-N.--.HGREECE.The French Minister, following the example of his British colleague, returned to-Athens on the 24th March. The Corps Diplomatique is exercised in mind as to whether, if invited, its members should attend the official Te Deum service on Greek Independence Day, 7th April. Sir F. Elliot observes that to abstain might give offence; to attend, during the continuance of the blockade, would be anomalous.The question of provisioning Greece continues to present the gravest difficulties.. Sir F. Elliot reports that the failure to secure the necessary tonnage in American waters will make it impossible to provide during- April and May the 15,000 tons-of wheat allotted by the Allied Board as the monthly ration for Venizelist Greece-end the 19,000 tons monthly required for the rest of the country.   The estimated deficiency will be 16,000 tons.   Under these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Govern-, merit have agreed to  the adoption of a scheme proposed  by Sir F. Elliot,  in! consultation -with his French colleague, whereby cargoes in sight will, be divided,
pro ml a between Venizelist and Royalist Greece, thus providing for each about 70 per cent, of full rations for &apos;5&apos;4 clays. In the meanwhile, the representative of M. Venizelos at Paris has informed the I1&apos;tench Government that the condition of affairs in Thessaly is desperate. Armed bands are ravaging the country; the inhabitants have expressed their determination to resist by force any attempt&apos; to transport their next crops into Royalist Greece. The Provisional Government, bound by their engagements to the Powers, declare themselves unable to do anything in response to the urgent appeals of the population.A. fresh difficulty has arisen out of the blockade, affecting in this instance the interests of British and French holders of Greek bonds. The International Financial Commission, unable to supply the Depots of Regie with the necessary stocks of saltt petroleum, matches, &amp;c, have reason to anticipate a serious decrease of revenue, and a corresponding reduction in the service of the guaranteed loans. The Commission:, therefore, recommend the immediate suspension of the blockade in respect of these. Regie commodities. They also consider it inexpedient that the Provisional Government should continue to hold the entire monthly receipts of the Salonika Customs. They recommend that the Provisional Government be called upon, to deposit with the Bank of Athens in the jnatne of the Commission a certain proportion (calculated at 5,255,000 drachmas for the current year) of the revenues assigned to.the service of the 1914 loan.A telegram from Lord Grairville (28th March) states that General Sarrail has notified M. Venizelos of his intention to introduce French paper money as forced currency on the 15th April, at a rate of exchange to be fixed by himself. The Provisional Government are dismayed at the prospect; the only remedy they can recommend is the immediate despatch by the National Bank of a sufficient quantity of Greek notes. The present rate of discount on French paper money is 12 per cent. ; on Italian notes it is 35 per cent. If the French currency is forced on Greece, the Provisional. Government expect that the Italians will follow suit.The Greek Government have nominated M. Tsitseclis, an ex-Judge, as then-representative on the Commission on Indemnities.On 20th March, after a public demonstration by Venizelists (thought to have been engineered, by the French), the citizens of the island of Zante abolished the local authorities, and declared their adherence to the Provisional Government. Sir F. Elliot, anticipating that the Greek Government will take measures to repress the movement, has requested instructions in re. Meanwhile, the Naval Commander-in-Chief at Argostoli, arriving at Zante on the 27th, personally re-instated the Royalist authorities.The Military Control Officer at Syra reported on 22nd March that 300 French troops had been landed at Milo, and that their next objective is Naxos, where the emery mines are situated. His Majesty&apos;s Minister is of opinion (and His Majesty&apos;s Government concur) that any French occupation of other islands is very undesirable, on. account of the strong anti-Venizelist spirit which they have displayed at Milo. He also points out that, under the rearrangement of naval spheres, Naxos is in the British zone. Lord Bertie reports (26th. March) that the French, authorities clearly understand that if any occupation is required, it must be by British troops.Sir F. Elliot states that French, troops have occupied the village of Nokro to the west of Sarandaporos Pass; also the monastery of Zidanion, in the district of Servia south of the neutral zone. In reporting the latter incident, His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Volo states that the French troops are expected to occupy Elassona. The Greek Government and Press are indignant at the action of the French troops in shooting a number of priests at Zidanion. A communique of General Sarrail. states that two persons, one a Bulgarian priest, were shot at the monastery for concealing arms ; at other places, armed Comitacljis have been, or will be, shot, .as these bands constitute a menace to the Army of the East.The Venizelist agent in London has protested officially against the encroachments by Italian troops in Epirus, and especially in the district of Chimara, whence they have deported leading Greek families. lie also refers to the increasing number of the Italian forces in Corfu. The Italian Minister at Athens has informed the Greek Government that the Italian advance in Epirus is dictated by military necessity and implies no encroachment on Greek sovereignty. In reply to a note addressed to the Italian Government byT liis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome enquiring as to the meaning of these movements, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has explained that they have been carried out partly at the request of General Sarrail and partly as the result of decisions by the Conference at Rome.2592-j. B
GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.There have been persistent rumours from several quarters of serious rioting in German cities. One of these, transmitted by His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Stockholm, H) reported many cases of incendiarism at Hamburg, and mentioned an epidemic of smallpox jin Berlin. The German wireless refers to these rumours as natural manifestations of Entente activities. A message to the &quot; New York American &quot; on the 21st says &quot; that the state of Berlin is as peaceful as a Sunday morning in summer time. &quot; Enquiries in all parts of the Empire fail to disclose the slightest symptoms of &quot; political discontent.&quot;Another official, message describes an interview between Herr Zimmermann and a deputation of Lithuanians from occupied territory ; the petitioners were informed that the German Government regarded them and their aspirations with great good will, and that their wishes in regard to measures of self-government would be favourably considered, after the war.SWITZERLAND.Mr. Denys Cochin, French Minister for Blockade, has accepted the British Governments invitation to come to London to discuss questions arising out of the blockade, including the proposed purchase of Swiss cattle (vide Summary No. 7).HOLLAND.His Majesty&apos;s representative at the Hague has taken occasion to set before the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs several reasons for the British Governments present dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Netherlands Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed great concern at the implication that Holland had shown herself more friendly to the Central Powers than to the Entente; this impression would be removed, he said, if His Majesty&apos;s Government knew how bitter is the language used by Germany and Austria in criticising Hollands friendliness for the Allies.In a despatch telegraphed on. the 20th, Sir W. Townley sets forth the difficulties and dangers with which the Dutch Government is confronted and suggests, as a matter of political expediency, that the circumstances determining British relations with. Holland should be very carefully considered at the present juncture. Referring to Great Britaiits demand for the admission of armed merchantmen into Dutch ports, His Majesty&apos;s Minister observes that the Germans have undoubtedly threatened Holland with most serious consequences (possibly war) if this demand be conceded. The Dutch. Government will therefore be compelled to refuse it; but Sir W. Townley doubts that any real benefit to our interests would, result from the retaliatory measures projected. These would, in effect, put a stop to all coin muni-cation between England and Holland, make Holland economically dependent on Germany, and. divert to that country a considerable quantity of foodstuffs and other commodities which would otherwise come to the United Kingdom. For these and other reasons, Sir W. Townley recommends the adoption of a friendly, rather than an unfriendly, attitude towards Holland. He understands that the Dutch Government and shipowners are prepared to go to considerable lengths in maintaining trade in Dutch bottoms with England if they are freed from the demand to admit armed merchantmen.The Netherlands Government have received and declined an offer from Germany to replace the seven Dutch vessels torpedoed by seven ships on charter. The conditions attached to this proposal were unanimously regarded as unsatisfactory by Dutch shipowners. On 27th March the terms of the original offer were officially &quot;corrected&quot; in such a manner as to lead the shipowners concerned to perceive a possible basis for further negotiations. The &quot; correction &quot; states that the German Government are considering the question of meeting the losses of owners by enabling them to purchase German ships &quot;which, they would be able to use on the conclusion of peace.&quot; 0SWEDEN.The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir E. Howard on 22nd March that, in reply to the United States Governments enquiry concerning Swedeits treatment of
armed merchantmen, he had explained verbally to the American Minister that every case will he considered on its merits. Swedish neutrality regulations make no provision for such cases and the Swedish Government have had no experience inthe matter.Noting the suggestions recently mooted in both Houses of Parliament that, in view of the submarine campaign, the import traffic of neutral countries should be stopped unless they desist from all trade with Germany, Sir E. Howard points out that if any such policy were adopted towards Sweden, the result would be at least a temporary stoppage of transit traffic to Russia, lie thinks it advisable that&apos; Members should realise the already existing cliffimilties that have to be surmounted, in maintaining this most important traffic.A. great impression has been made in Sweden by the announcement of the new Russian &apos; Governments intention to re-establish the autonomy of Finland. Phe Conservatives and Pro-Germans are greatly disconcerted and the parties of the Left -correspondingly elated. The Swedish Finns, who are strongly pro-German, met on the 21st March and passed resolutions, casting doubts on the permanence as well as the good faith of the new regime in Russia and urging the necessity for international guarantees in regard to the future liberties of Finlaud. Professor Soderhjelm, of Helsingsfors, while dissociating himself from the spirit manifested in these resolutions, has suggested to Sir E. Howard that Great Britain and France should take the initiative in settling the question internationally, and, if this not be feasible, that, at least the two Governments should jointly and publicly express to the Russian Government their satisfaction at the re-establishment of Finlands state rights.The Anglo-Swedish agreement is still under discussion by a secret committee of the Swedish Parliament. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed to Sir E. Howard the hope that a compromise between the parties in Parliament may result, but the Press shows as yet no signs of agreement on the subject. A. monster address, expressing public confidence, was presented to the Prime Minister on 27th March ; it is supposed to contain 750,000 signatures. On the strength and success of this demonstration, the parties of the Right are now insisting that the country is behind the Prime Minister,   it is therefore probable that the deadlock will continue.NORWAY.Negotiations are proceeding at christiania for the proposed working agreement between Great Britain and Norway in regard to coal licences and the employment of Norwegian tonnage. The Prime Minister is of opinion that, if Great Britain requisitions Norwegian shipping (a measure against which the Norwegian Government would be compelled, to record, their protest so as not to afford Germany valid grounds for complaint), the Norwegian ships requisitioned should be employed in inter-Allied trades and British armed ships used for the Anolo-Norwegian traffic. He assumes also that the arrangements for requisitioning will be made in agreement with the Shipowners&apos; Association. The amount of coal required by Norway is estimated at .200,000 tons a month. .DENMARK.The Minister for Foreign Affairs has drawn the attention of His Majesty&apos;s representative to the pernicious effect produced on public opinion, towards Great Britain by a recent article in the &quot; Morning Post,&quot; which contained statements injurious and unfair to the Danish nation. He said, that unless more consideration were shown by Great Britain for DenmarlCs difficulties and needs, it might be difficult to prevent farmers from sending all their produce to Germany. They are indignant that their cattle fodder and fertilisers should be held up, in spite of the fact that, at great loss and inconvenience to themselves, they have fulfilled their obligations in respect of EnglaiuPs share. Shipowners lay stress on the fact that they are expected to cany v all Danish produce to England while no British shipping comes&apos; to Danish ports. At the present moment there is an accumulation of over 5,000 tons of bacon and a -considerable quantity of Imtter awaiting, shipment to the United Kingdom.Referring to recent reports of smuggling across the frontier into Germany, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Copenhagen has informed the Foreign Office (26th March) that the matter has been brought to the notice of the Danish Government.   The result of
Iris own enquiries leads him to the conclusion that the frontier is effectively watched and that smuggling on any considerable scale is improbable. The prohibition against exporting corn is very strictly enforced.The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir It. Paget on the 26th instant that a German aeroplane had passed over Esbjerg in a most defiant manner. The German Government, ,in recent discussion of these matters with the Danish authorities, have declined to admit that their aircraft are in principle debarred from flying over Danish territory.SPAIN.In Summary No. 6 (7th March) reference was made to the negotiations of the Hamburg-American line for the purchase&apos;of a shipbuilding yard at Cadiz. Sir A. Hardinge now reports that the Swedish Minister is trying to buy this yard, for a Swedish Company for the purpose of building submarines (of German design) for the Spanish Government. There is good ground for the belief that Sweden is being used as a stalking horse for Germany. It is suggested that Great Britain should endeavour to purchase the property, which is valued at 70,000/,.In consequence of the shortage of the coal supply in Spain, the Spanish. Ambassador has notified His Majesty&apos;s Government that, from the 25th March, the Spanish Government will only permit iron ore for the United Kingdom to be loaded on to vessels which have brought 33 per cent, of coal. The general position, of Anglo-Spanish trade relations is about to form the subject of negotiations between the Marquis de Cortina and. His Majesty&apos;s Government; in the meanwhile, as a concession calculated to meet immediate needs, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to allow the export of coal to Spain in Spanish vessels even when arriving from Spain in ballast, an arrangement which should exclude them from all danger of German submarine attack. In return, it is expected that the Spanish Government will defer the operation of the iron ore regulation.PORTUGAL.While fully recognising the force of the reasous which have led. to the limitation of imports, and appreciating the concessions recently made, into Great Britain, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has requested Sir L. Carnegie (27th March) to express the hope of the Portuguese Government that the restrictions on Portuguese wine might be removed altogether, if this were done it would &quot; restore confidence and remove a painful impression.&quot; The Portuguese Government on their side would, undertake that no more than one-fifth of the cargo of any ship leaving Portugal should consist of wine.The Portuguese Government are still in difficulties with regard to the financing of their wheat purchases, and continue to hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will advance the 1.600,000/. they require.CHINA.The German Minister and his staff left Peking on the 25th March, under British safe-conducts enabling them to return to Germany rid the United States and Holland. As regards the German Consular officials from the Treaty ports and. the interior, arrangements have been made by Mr. Alston with the Chinese Government for the issue of safe-conducts by His Majesty&apos;s Oousul-General at Shanghai, their port of embarkation. Precautionary measures have been taken to prevent any Germans leaving China for Siam.The situation as regards Chiiuds relations with Germany has not developed since the date of the last Report. Mr. Alston, is of opinion that the news of the revolution in Russia has increased the manifest reluctance of the President to declare war. The Allied representatives have, however, made it quite clear that no substantial advantages are to be expected from the Allies until they are definitely assured as to China&apos;s intentions. An intimation to this effect was conveyed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 21st March. On the 24th, Mr. Alston was instructed to conduct nego-tiations on a basis which (while allowing a certain margin for bargaining) would secure-to China, upon, declaring war, an immediate increase of the import tariff to 5 per cent, effective, relief from the Boxer indemnities till the end of the war, and the removal of restrictions on the movements of Chinese troops at Tientsin. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-in en t. understand that the Japanese Government are generally prepared to agree to these arrangements.   At the same time; it has been intimated to the Foreign Office by the
Japanese Ambassador that, at a later stage of the negotiations, the Japanese Govern-ment intend to ask China to concede certain economic advantages in return for the increase in the import tariff. They would lind it. dillicult, it seems, to defend to the Japanese public the raising of China&apos;s import duties because of its effect on Japanese industries, unless an excise duty were imposed by the Chinese Government upon goods which compete with Japanese manufactures, or unless the export duties upon certain unspecified commodities were abolished. His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that, if any such proposal is to be made it should be advanced at an early stage of the proceedings. Referring thereto, Mr. Alston telegraphed on the 27th that his Japanese colleague was opposed to making any such demand and. hoped to be able to persuade his Government to drop it.His M.ajesty&apos;s Consul at Harbin, reported on the 23rd March that the Executive Committee of the Government of Harbin had removed the Chief of Police and the Civil Governor and that the position of General. Horvat (in control of the municipal and communal administration of the Chinese Eastern Railway area) was precarious. Two days later, however, Sir G. Buchanan was able to inform His Majesty&apos;s Government that General Horvat/s position had been favourably considered by the Russian Government and that he would probably remain at his post.A report communicated to the Foreign Office and to the Government of India by His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Kashgar on the 25th March states,that a quantity of rifles and ammunition have lately been secretly sold to Afghans from the Chinese Ordnance Stores at Kashgar and are being smuggled into Afghanistan. The Consul-General suggests strengthening the scouts in Sarikol, to prevent the smuggling of these arms into Afghanistan, and. across the Indian border. At the same time he is requesting his Russian colleague to join him in protesting to the local Chinese authorities.ARGENTINA.The Argentine Government have requested Sir R. Tower to submit again, to His Majesty&apos;s Government their scheme for the purchase of a number of steamships, belonging to an Austro-American Company, now lying in Philadelphia and New-Orleans. It is proposed that the purchase money should be paid two months after signature of peace, that the fleets voyages be limited to Great Britain and Allied countries, Spain and. South America, and. that its personnel be seconded from the Argentine Navy. The Austrian Government are prepared to sanction the arrangement.BRAZIL.As an offset to the restrictions on the importation of coffee, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have instructed. Sir A. Peel to inform the Brazilian Government that it may be possible to render them some financial assistance. The Treasury are prepared to consider proposals for opening a&apos;credit of a million sterling at Rothschilds in favour of the Brazilian Government, for the discharge of obligations to British holders of Brazilian bonds, against the purchase or collateral security of Brazilian coffee.CHILE.The Chilean Government have appointed a German as Consul at Tampico, on the recommendation of their Consul-General in Mexico City, who is also a German and has held the post for eight years. The British and French Ministers in Mexico have made representations to the Chilean. Charge d&apos;Affaires on the subject of the Tampico appointment, with a view to its cancellation.Proposals have been made by a Danish group to purchase the German interest in the Slomann nitrate works and to convert the business into a Banish or Chilean Company. Persons interested in this scheme at Copenhagen have requested Sir R. Paget to ascertain the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the proposed purchase.MEXICO.The attitude of the Mexican Government, as manifested by the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at an interview with Mr. Thurstan on the 25th March,2592-4 C
conveys a general impression of truculence tempered with caution. This functionary informed His Majesty&apos;s representative that the Mexican Government would exercise the same vigilance in regard to tire German sailing ships at Santa Rosalia as they would, to ships of other belligerent Powers, British for instance. Mexico having no Navy, he was instructed, on behalf of his Government and as proof of their good faith, to suggest that the British. Government should send cruisers to keep watch&apos; on Santa Rosalia from beyond, territorial waters. No written, reply has been vouchsafed to the note in which Mr. Thurstan endeavoured to impress upon the Mexican Government their responsibility for due supervision ashore of German activities.On the 21st March the Press in the United States published proof of close relations between the German Vice-Consulate at Tori-eon and Villa&apos;s adherents, in the form of a facsimile of a receipt by the Yice-Consul on official paper for a war contribution of 200 dollars. On the 25th, Mr. Thurstan telegraphed a report from His Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consul at Mazatl.au to the effect that Villa, aided by Germans, was expecting to receive three cargoes of war munitions by sailing vessels, to be landed between Manzanillo and Mazatlau. On the 26th, the United States Consul at Manzanillo informed His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Colima that six million cartridges had been brought in on a Mexican transport from Salvador by a German secret agent and landed at Manzanillo ; they were being sent to Mexico city by military train. On the 27th, Mr. Thurstan reported that a new method of sending wireless messages had been introduced at Mexico city, which was under observation by United States warships. In view of these intrigues and activities, and of the fact that the United States Ambassador seems anxious to support Senor Carranza, Mr. Thurstan asks fox-instructions as to His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy toward&apos;s the Mexican Government.On the 26th March, the United States Consul at Ta.mpi.co reported to his Embassy that the S.S.&apos;&quot; Anton in a &quot; had moved, down river to a point where, if sunk, she would block the harbour entrance. Mr. Thurstan is of opinion that she is more likely to be used for this purpose than to put to sea. Very considerable American interests would, be affected by the blocking of the harbour.PANAMA.Sir C. Mallet telegraphs that the wireless station at St. Andrew&apos;s Island (off the East coast of Nicaragua) is again at work ; also a circumstantial rumour to the effect that prior to the resumption of operations, a party of Germans had landed there.UNITED&apos; STATES.Anticipating the declaration of Avar, or the state of Avar, which is expected to follow the meeting of Congress on the 2nd April, the United States Go\rernment have authorised their Embassy in London to consult the Foreign Office informally in regard to war trade organization. Sir R. Crawford has been informed at the State Department that legislative steps are contemplated, which Avill enable the United States Government to unhid up or control firms operating primarily in enemy interests. It is not anticipated., however, that they will adopt a black list policy in respect of enemy firms in South America (except such as are known or suspected to be supplying materials for submarines), as such a policy would involve them lit undesirable controversies with the South American Republics.With regard to the measures instituted by the United States Goyerpment to prevent the enemy from receiving financial assistance from America (vide last Report), His Majesty&apos;s Government have drawn attention at Washington to the fact that many Avireless messages continue to pass from New York to Germany referring to transmission of funds, creation of credits and deposit of German securities.Sir C. Spring Rice has transmitted, for the information of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the results of recent informal negotiations between Sir R. Crawford and Governor Harding, in regard to the form in Avhich the United States would render financial assistance to the Allies. Sir R. Crawford has proposed that the United States Government should make a direct loan of 8.1,000,000,000 to the Allies at the same rate of interest at which the United States Government could borrow,&quot; say, 3i- per cent. Governor Harding and the Secretary of State are prepared to support the plan.   The Secretary of the Treasury has intimated to Sir R. Crawford that the
United &apos; States Government will probably have  proposals to make on or  about 27th March.His Majesty&apos;s representative at Washington, draws attention to the fact that tho absence of any comment by His Majesty&apos;s Government on. Germany&apos;s announcements of the success of her submarine warfare is having a very bad effect on American public opinion. The uneasiness felt by all. classes and particularly by financiers has &apos; been intensified: by Lord Charles Beresford&apos;s speech of 27th March. The Ambassador recommends that a reassuring official statement be published as soon as possible to counteract this disturbing impression and its possible effect on Congress.PEACE 1 ).l SC USSIONS.Sir II. Rum.bold learns, from a generally reliable source, that the German Chancellor, on the occasion of his recent visit to Vienna, admitted that German pourparlers for a separate peace with Russia had taken place with members of the old regime at Petrograd, adding that though Austria had not been consulted, her interests had been protected. This admission, attributed to the fear of possible disclosures at Petrograd, has made a very bad impression on the Austrian Government. It is suggested that if the fact of the secret negotiations were proved and published, it, would go far to cause a breach between Vienna and. Berlin.The Minister for Foreign Affairs at Berne informed Sir R. Rumboldon 24th March that there is absolutely no foundation for the report, recently circulated, to the effect that Germany had approached the Swiss Government with a view to. securing their mediation, for peace.GERMAN  SUBMARINE  CAMPAIGN.There are now 07 British and Allied vessels detained in the Baltic. As a means of securing their release, while saving the face of the Swedish Government, Mr. Alex. Johnson has proposed, to Sir E. Howard that he should purchase the British vessels, financing the transaction through PlainbrO. He undertakes to arrange with the Swedish authorities for the ships to be taken through the Kogrund passage under the Swedish flag; thereafter they would be resold or chartered to British ownership. In any case, he asserts that whether resold or chartered, the Swedish Government would allow the ships to be armed. Sir E. Howard regards the proposed arrangement as greatly preferable to the requisitioning of Swedish ships in British ports and suggests that Mr. Alex. Johnson be authorised to negotiate accordingly, in antici-pation of the release of vessels detained in the Baltic, Mis Majesty&apos;s Minister at Christiania has been instructed to make such confidential, provisional, arrangements as may be feasible to supply them with Norwegian crews, whenever the Swedish Government may authorise their passage through the Kogrund Channel.Sir M. Findlay has called the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the fact that much dissatisfaction and delay are caused by the regulation which requires all vessels leaving Norway for Great Britain to call at Bergen. The British Naval Attache is of opinion that, this system, and the sailing instructions resulting therefrom, should forthwith be modified. The Germans have means of obtaining at Bergen very precise information as regards the movements of ships and of tampering with their crews. Norwegian shipowners, as well as Danish, are reported to be losing confidence in the naval measures for the protection of Bergen-Lerwick route, because vessels during recent crossings have not sighted any British warships.With reference to the negotiations now proceeding for the diversion, of Norwegian tonnage from trade between neutral countries to that of the Allies (an essential part of the British, proposals) His Majesty?s representative at Christiania has been directed to point out that His majesty&apos;s Government cannot be expected to encourage any shipping arrangements by which the enterprise and courage of Norwegian, shipowners and crews may be made to benefit countries such as Holland or Denmark, whose vessels refuse to put to sea. In this connection, Sir M. Findlay reports that, in order to prevent the acquisition of Norwegian shipping by Great Britain, Germany is offering to charter it wholesale and at high rates.Exasperated by their failure to sink any of the six Danish vessels which recently made their experimental voyage to England (vide last Report), the German Admiralty have now decided, according to the German Commercial Attache at Copenhagen,.to detail 50 submarines for the special purpose of destroying Danish shipping.    In
recognition of the good-will manifested in the matter of these produce boats, His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed (2Gth March) to allow the resumption of Danish traffic with the United States, and Sir R. Paget has been instructed accordingly.Germany has informed the Netherlands Government that it will be quite safe for Dutch vessels in British ports to leave for Holland on the 1st of May, provided that they give an undertaking not to resume trade with the Allies.GENERAL.At the instance of the Danish and British Red Cross Societies, enquiries are being instituted, through the Netherlands Minister at Berlin, having regard to the fact that the conveyance of parcels to prisoners of war in Germany has been most unsatisfactory since the beginning of February. In the case of some camps, only 2 per cent, of the parcels sent have been acknowledged.It has been reported on good authority that for some time past the Germans have been assembling all available German pilots acquainted with the Scheldt, and that they are stopping Dutch lighter traffic to Ghent and from Antwerp.In view of the shortage of agricultural labour in England, arrangements have been made to bring from Denmark and to employ experimentally a detachment of oOSchleswig deserters, who are said to be willing to come on condition that they will not be sent back to Germany against their will after the war. At the instance of the War Office, enquiries have been made, through His Majesty&apos;s representative at the Hague, to ascertain Avhether, in like manner, any of the large number of German deserters in Holland, might he willing to come to England and suitable for the purposes in view. Sir W. Townle3r reports that only a very small number of these deserters would accept service in England under the conditions imposed (i.c, as prisoners of war), and that they would, probably be undesirables of the spy class. There are, however, 1,700 Russian Poles in Rotterdam (intending emigrants to Canada) whose services might prove useful.
