APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT, No. 21.Greece.M. Jonnart appears to be handling the situation with tact and firmness. While the pro-German faction is being deprived of all its leaders, who are being deported or interned, Surrender is made easy for the loyalists, and Venizelist aspirations for immediate mastery and for partisan reprisals are kept in check, at any rate at Athens. The somewhat unnecessary excitement created by King Alexanders expressions of filial piety in his first proclamation seems to have died down. It now remains for tbe Allies to consider how the resources -in harbours, railways, roads, foodstuffs, and, if possible, also in fighting men of a united Greece can be developed to their utmost capacity in order to strengthen their military position in the Balkans.Bulgaria.Bulgarians determination to retain her conquests and to build up her future position in closest association with the Central Powers is so evident, and so natural, that it is difficult to understand the optimistic views entertained, in some quarters as to the possibility of a separate peace with the &quot; Prussia of the Balkans.&quot;G e km any..r&apos;V M. ribot&apos;s emphatic reassertion of the French claim to Alsace-Lorraine has evoked equally emphatic retorts on the part of the German Press of all shades of opinion, as well as protests from the Alsace-Lorraine Parliament. While there is little doubt that Germany would be willing to cede Metz and a part of French Lorraine, it is certain that nothing short of complete and utter defeat will induce her to surrender what she regards as an integral part of the German nation. In spite of Socialist Conferences and talk about &quot; peace without annexation,&quot; we come back to the fundamental fact that the really important issues in this war are incapable of settlement by agreement, and must be decided by the logic of the stricken field.Austria.The resignation of the Austrian Premier, Count Olam-Martinitz, apparently over the Polish question, marks a further but no doubt only, temporary hitch in the difficult task of getting the Middle European constitutional position adjusted.Sweden.The American stoppage of Swedish grain ships whose return to Sweden we were pledged to facilitate under the Kogrund Passage agreement, illustrates a type of difficulty which is almost certain to recur. Neutrals who have made agreements with us on the assumption that the United States were also neutral, will naturally consider themselves ill-used if they think that we are now using the American lever in order-to extort fresh concessions or go back on our agreements.   In any case it is obviously
important that the Americans should be fully aware of the nature and terms of all agreements already concluded, so that the extra pressure to be applied should involve as little excuse as possible for neutrals to claim that they have not had faith kept with them.Spain,The revolutionary movement in the Spanish Army has, at present at any rate, no relation with the international situation, except in so far as the Army is determined to keep out of the war. &quot;No fighting, more pay and more medals&quot; constitutes an unambitious, practical programme which an apparently unanimous Army should have no difficulty in securing.China.Idle Presidents statement that he has been compelled to dissolve Parliament in order to preserve the Republican form of government is evidently a- face-saving-phrase. The men who now control tlie Government from Tientsin, and whose nominees will draw salaries from the new Parliament, are sufficiently identified with the old regime to justify the belief that they will revert to the classical traditions of the monarchy at the first convenient opportunity. Tuan Chi-jui, ex-Premier, Li Ching-hsi, Premier Elect, and PJsii Shih-ch&apos;ang, Elder Statesman, are monarchists all more or less identified with the fortunes of the Manchu dynasty and legitimists by education. General Chang llstin is an opportunist of monarchical tendencies. The revision of the constitution may well provide an occasion for restoring the Dragon Throne together with the Young Emperor, under a Chinese Regent. Some such arrangement, if brought about with the approval and support of Japan, would seem to offer better prospects of stability than anything the Republic has produced.Peace Discussions.The chief event of the week has been the attempt of the Swiss Foreign Minister, M. Hoffmann, to promote a separate peace between Germany and Russia. The prompt expulsion of his agent, M. Grimm, by the Russian Government, backed up by. an overwhelming majority of the Soviet, is, perhaps, the most satisfactory thing that has happened in Russia since the Revolution. M. Hoffmanns resignation should also serve as a check upon the pro-German zeal of a section of the Swiss official world.L. S. A.21st June 1917.

PART I. BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL  CONFERENCE.With reference to previous telegrams1 regarding the functions and composition of the proposed Committee to deal with the control of wool production, the&quot;Australian Government have nominated their High Commissioner to represent the Commonwealth on the Committee.GENERAL.As the result of an enquiry by the Italian Government, the Governments of Australia and New Zealand have been asked whether there is any objection to Italian reservists, who have been recalled to the colours and who find difficulty in obtaining accommodation, in Italian or neutral vessels, being permitted to travel to Europe in ships conveying Australian or New Zealand troops and merchandise.Three Mormon missionaries being desirous of proceeding to Australia and five wishing to go to South Africa, the Governments of those Dominions have been asked whether the necessary visa can be given.CANADA.The Shipping Controller has agreed to the suggestion of the Dominion Ministers2 that ships building for neutrals should be immediately requisitioned. The Canadian Government are, however, asked to ensure that the vessels are properly completed in accordance with the contracts. The British Treasury are being asked to make the necessary payments, in respect of the vessels which may be requisitioned, through the Imperial Munitions Board.As to the arrangements for the requisitioning of ships3 the Canadian Government are taking steps to prohibit the transfer of the registry of a ship from a port of registry in Canada to a port of registry outside that Dominion without the consent of the Minister of Marine.Having heard of the possibility of the British Government requisitioning vessels of the Canadian Pacific Ocean Service trading between British Columbia and the Far East, the Minister of Marine points out that, though registered in Great Britain, these ships are owned by a Canadian company. As the only connection between Canada and the Far East, the trade in which the line is engaged is regarded as of vital importance, and, in accordance with the arrangement outlined in the telegram from the&apos; Secretary of State,4 it is assumed that the Canadian Government will be -consulted before any steps are taken to requisition the vessels mentioned.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The Government of the Commonwealth have sent, on behalf both of themselves and of the people of  the country, a  message  of  hearty congratulation on the1 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 23rd May, 6th and 12th Jnne 1917. - See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 16th. and 23rd May, and 6th June 1917. 8 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 30th May, 6th and 12th June 1917.

splendid success of the Army operating on the Western Front. After referring to-the gratifying progress made, the message speaks of the pride felt by Australia that her troops took part in the great work and maintained their high reputation.The Federal Parliament opened on 14th dune, as reported in the Press. At a meeting of the National Party, Mr. Hughes was congratulated on the vigorous lead giA-en by him during the Election, and a Resolution Avas carried unanimously affirming that all members elected on the National policy should form one united party, to be known as the Australian National Party. Mr. Hughes was elected leader of this Party ; AAdiile Mr. Tudor has been elected leader of the Labour Party.It is further piiblicly announced that a Conference has been held betAveen the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Navy and Representatives of the Unions concerned with shipbuilding, with the object of securing the co-operation of labour in establishing the shipbuilding industry in Australia.It is also announced that the maximum age for returned soldiers sitting for the public service examination in the clerical division has been fixed at 51 years.   The, successful candidate receives preference over civilian candidates, whose maximum age is 25 years.NEW ZEALAND.With further reference to the telegram concerning the disposition of German territory in the Pacific,1 the Dominion Government have expressed the wish that the substance of this should be included in the speech at the opening of Parliament on 28th June, and have asked if the British Government have any objection. The Ministers consider that the procedure they propose would exercise a good influence in serving to counteract the work of the Pacifists and Socialists, whose views are strongly opposed by practically all classes in the Dominion.As the French Government are desirous of establishing a French Consular agency at Apia to look after French interests in Samoa, and do not know of a suitable French resident for the task, they have asked that the name of a British resident may be suggested. The New Zealand Government have therefore been requested to consult the Administrator, and, if they see no objection, to suggest the name of a suitable British subject avIio could undertake the Avork.The New Zealand Government have arranged to nominate seven officers from the New Zealand Expeditionary Force for temporary commissions, and seven non-com-missioned officers for permanent commissions in the Indian Army next July and each July following. They will also nominate seven officers and seven non-commissioned officers for permanent commissions next January and each January following. This -Avill make a total of 21 permanent and 7 temporary commissions per annum. .SOUTH AFRICA.On the 19th June Mr. J. X. Merriman brought forward a Resolution in the House of Assembly condemning the propaganda in favour of Republicanism now being carried on by the Nationalist Party. The terms of the Resolution are thus given in a ReuteFs telegram :-&quot; That this House, viewing with alarm several manifestations of a Republican propaganda now being carried on in the country , desires to record its opinion that such manifestations, whether by speech, writing, or other methods, are directly at variance Avith the Constitution of the country as laid down and agreed to in the South Africa Act, that they are opposed to the best interests of the people, and that, if persisted in, they must inevitably lead to fatal dissensions and, the ultimate ruin of&quot; the European race in South Africa. This House therefore calls upon all those who are loyal to the Constitution to express the strongest disapproval of the dangerous efforts of those who seek to, subvert the principles on Avhich that Constitution is based.&quot;After a lively debate, this Resolution is reported to have been carried by 72 votes-to 21, the minority consisting wholly of members of the Nationalist party .&apos; See Western and General Report for week ending 12th June 1917.

It is suggested that, as in the case of the deaths of Europeans, it is important to provide for the period between the date of death and the payment of the pension to dependants. Ministers believe that the suggested course is not only a fair one, but is necessary in order to avoid hardship to dependants.  .RHODESIA.In reply to the suggestion that the second Rhodesian Regiment should be sent to France to serve with an Imperial unit2 the Army Council are unable to arrange this as difficulties would arise from the difference in establishment and rates of pay. The Army Council therefore suggest that the Regiment should be used to reinforce the South African Brigade, on the understanding that Rhodesiahs are kept as far as possible in separate companies or platoons. In the alternative the Army Council suggest the employment of the regiment in East Africa under General Northey. The High Commissioner for South Africa (Lord Buxton) has agreed to the alternatives put forward and proposes to put them before the Administrator of Southern Rhodesia.PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.General Northey reports (12th June) that the enemy in Portuguese territory are now concentrating at Mwembe, about 120 miles north-east of Fort Johnston, but otherwise there is no change.LIBERIA.The Spanish Government have made inquiries as to whether German residents of Liberia, whose transfer to Spain has been approved by the British Government, may leave Africa at once or whether they will be given safe conducts by the British Consul-General at Monrovia.JAMAICA.The Governor has urged the importance of providing early transportation for the seventh contingent which is now ready.   The &apos; enlistment of West Indians from1 See Western and General Report for weeks ending 14th March and 18th April 1917, and footnotes to figures there given.2 See Western and General Report for week ending 9th May 1917. 3209- -3 11
GCentral America in Colon and Panama is bringing in considerable numbers of men of first-rate quality. If the men can be promptly transported the &quot;enthusiasm will no&apos; doubt be maintained, and it is anticipated that some 3,000 or more men may be obtained. In reply the Secretary of State has telegraphed (ISth June) that the &quot;Briton &quot; will be able to embark the seventh Contingent about 12th July and that an effort will lie made to provide a special transport for Panama and Colon recruits. Meantime, particulars are required as to suggested arrangements for equipping these recruits and supplying them with officers.WINDWARD ISLANDS.The Secretary of State has telegraphed an expression of the high appreciation of the British Government at the action of the Legislative Council of Grenada in accepting the principle of compulsory military service.MALTA.Having regard to the number of British officers, &amp;c. that would be demanded, the Army Council have decided that it is not advisable to raise a Maltese Brigade of Infantry. They would, however, be happy to avail themselves of one of the existing battalions of the Malta Regiment of Militia for work on lines of communi-cation in Egypt. This would necessitate the raising of a third battalion for Malta garrison duty. The Army Council would also be glad to have five or more labour battalions for employment in France or Salonika.&apos; MALAY  STATES.The High Commissioner has telegraphed that the Sultan of Behang died on 19th June last.PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ALLIED COMMON AFFAIRS.His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the results of the recent Silk Conference negotiations are highly satisfactory, and have directed Sir R. Rodd to express their hope that the Italian Government may ratify the agreement without delay.Representations have been addressed to the French and Italian Governments wdth a view to impressing upon them the importance which the War Cabinet attach to the rapid development of the overland transport route to Tarauto. The Director-General of Movements and Railways and the Inspector-General of Transportation have proceeded to Paris to discuss all details of the scheme with the French Railway Authorities. By the adoption of certain measures it is hoped that the new route may be available for traffic very shortly and a considerable saving thereby effected in transport tonnage requirements.On 14th June the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir G. Buchanan that he had decided to suggest a Conference of the Allies, as the only possible way to harmonise their respective views in regard to the prosecution and purposes of the war. He thought that the prospect of a Conference would have a beneficial effect on public opinion in Russia and tend, to divert the attention of the Army from.1 See Western and General Reports for weeks ending 30th May and 6th June 1917.
politics ; but be did not propose that it should be held until some time in August. On the loth M. Ribot, desiring to forestall the undesirable proposal of. a meeting in Petrograd, announced his intention of inviting the Russian Giovernment to depute a Minister to attend a Conference of the Allies to be held in Paris on or about 15th July. He explained to Mr. Grahame that this date was named, instead of the end of June, because Baron Sonnino will not be able to leave Italy until the ministerial situation has been adjusted and the Parliamentary session concluded, which cannot be before the end of the second week in July. Sir G. Buchanan, telegraphing on the 18th, stated that the Russian Government had no intention of suggesting that the Conference should be held at Petrograd. Their idea is that it should take place in London.ITALY.The Italian Ambassador took occasion on 14-th June to discuss with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the terms of a Memorandum handed to him by the Foreign Office on the 7th, referring to the possible necessity for revision of the Allies&apos; respective claims, in case the main provisions of their existing agreement could not be carried out. His Excellency demurred to the stipulation that the equitable consideration to be given in -that event to the respective claims of the Allies would depend upon the efforts made by each in the war. In reply, Lord Robert Cecil informed him that this provision had been most carefully considered by the War Cabinet, who were tmanimously opposed to any modifications thereof. In placing it on record, His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplated the possibility of having to ask the Italian Government for a considerabby increased military effort in spheres of operations other than the Italian front.Sir R. Rodd, in reporting the official communication issued on 13th June by the Italian Government with reference to the political situation, held it to mean that till, danger of a ministerial crisis had been averted, there would be no public discussion of foreign policy, and that the Premier had been given a free&apos;hand in the matter of Cabinet reorganisation. It was thought that a special War Cabinet might be formed. On 15th June Baron Sonnino said that he had hopes that the Government would come before the Chamber on the 20th as an undivided body. On the 16th, changes were announced in the Ministries of W&apos;ar, Marine and Munitions, and the powers of the Commissioner of Supplies were extended. The new Ministers are : War, General Giardino ; Marine, Admiral Triangi ; Munitions, General Ball &apos;01io. The Coal Commission is merged in the Ministry of Transports under Sign or Ricardo Bianchi.SAVLTZERLAND.At an interview with His Majesty&apos;s Minister on 19th June, the Swiss Minister for Foreign Affairs, M. Hoffmann, explained and defended his action in communicating Germany&apos;s alleged peace terms to his colleague M. Grimm at Petrograd. He had acted entirely on his own initiative and in the interests of Switzerland, being of opinion that the position of neutrals was becoming intolerable. In reply, Sir H. Rumbold observed that his action amounted to a breach of neutrality and was certainly calculated to irritate public opinion in England. M. Hoffmann&apos;s resignation came before the National Council on the same day. In accepting it, the members present unanimously repudiated all connection or sympathy with his proceedings.. Three members of the Council were absent and a rumour was current that they also would resign.The French Government have invited the Belgian Government to join them in addressing a protest to Switzerland in this matter.GREECE.On 14th June the Foreign Office instructed Mr. Grahame to ascertain the views of the French Government as to the future Government of Greece, suggesting at the same time that M. Venizelos should return to Athens as soon as possible.   On the previous
day Lord Granville telegraphed a summary of the opinions which M. Venizelos had expressed to him in regard to the situation in general and to the Provisional Govern-&apos; menPs plans for reorganisation of the Government.   Pie had doubts as to Prince Alexanders fitness for the Throne, and would have preferred Prince Paul, as being&apos; more serious and dignified.   Pie now expects that M. Zaimis will proceed to conclude -some sort of convention with the Provisional Government to restore the unity of Greece and that, when this has been done, he himself will, be called upon to form.a new Ministry.    On 1.7th June, Plis Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires reported that the-High Commissioner had invited M. Zaimis to proceed at once to negotiate with. M. Venizelos with a view to re-establishing the unity of Greece under a constitutional regime.   M. Venizelos will insist upon a specific understanding that the Constitution will be revised immediately after the war and that certain of the present judicial: authorities will be removed.   As regards reprisals, M. Venizelos said there would, be none, in the true sense of the word, but there were certain individuals whose crimes must be  punished  by legal  methods.   It would  be necessary to bring-some  of  the Bishops before the Ecclesiastical Court and to remove some Army officers ; but there would be no vindictiveness.    lie expected to be aide to go to Athens at the end of the month (M. Jonnart  considers it very desirable that M. Venizelos should not return to Athens until party feeling has had time to cool down and until he can do so without foreign interference).   On the 16th he expressed to Lord Granville his indignation at the wording of tlie new Kin.g&apos;s proclamation particularly at the passage which announces his intention &quot;to follow in the brilliant, footsteps of his :father&apos;s reign.&quot;   The fact of its having been countersigned by M. Zaimis made it much worse.   He announced that upon assuming office he will require the King to issue a new proclamation in which will be emphasized the strictly democratic character of the Monarchy.   Meanwhile, as the result of this provocatively worded document, M. Venizelos has rescinded his intention to allow certain of his-Ministers to join the Zaimis Cabinet ad interim,   Admiral Coundouriotis, through the Press, demands that the proclamation be withdrawn ; M. Venizelos has expressed to Lord Granville his regret at the violence of the gallant officePs language.   In this connection it is important to note that, according to the statement made by M. Ribot in the Senate on 15th June, Prince Alexander^ succession to the Throne is subject to  ratification  by  the  National  Assembly,  which,  will  have   to   be   convoked.. M. Venizelos objects, however, to the idea of a general election for several reasons,, the principal one being that 60,000 of his followers, and none of his adversaries, are with the colours.   He insists that constitutionally and politically he is entitled to-ask for the reassembly of the Chamber improperly dissolved by King Constantine in 1915, a Chamber which had given three decided votes in favour of war on the side of the Allies.As matters stand there appears to be little immediate prospect of bringing M. Zaimis and M. Venizelos together in direct negotiation. M. Venizelos himself is-reasonable, but many of his followers (especially officers of the army) are more than ever distrustful of the Government at Athens since the King&apos;s proclamation, and very impatient at the restraints imposed upon them by the prudent policy of the High Commissioner. On the 19th, M. Jonnart had not yet received M. Zaimis&apos;s reply to his proposals for commencing negotiations, but in conversation with Mr. Crackanthorpe he expressed the hope that a basis of agreement might soon be found. The High Commissioner^; policy is criticised, not only at Salonika but in Paris, as-somewhat lacking in vigour since the King&apos;s abdication ; he has vindicated it to His Majesty&apos;s Charge cbAfiaires on the ground that if the situation were forced and civil war resulted, it would involve retaining at Athens for an indefinite period the troops diverted from Salonika. His immediate object is by gentle persuasion to bring about direct negotiations between the two parties, with a view to Cabinet reconstruction.. As to the new King&apos;s proclamation, he sees nothing in it to justify severe criticism.The attitude adopted by M. Zaimis on the subject of negotiations, as reported by Mr. Crackanthorpe on the 18th, is certainly not of a nature to encourage hopes of an early fusion of the two parties in the State. He thought it possible, if the Provi-sional Government were now dissolved and M. Venizelos temporarily effaced, that Venizelist elements might be introduced into the Government in two or. three months. He had great hopes that M. Jonnart would be able to curb the hotheads of Salonika and arrange a settlement on these lines. On the same day M. Venizelos informed Lord Granville that he hoped to return to Athens, acclaimed by the people, in about a fortnight; at the same time he has assured M. Jonnart that he has no wish to go-
SERBIA.The Serbian representatives in London, Rome, Paris and Petrograd have received instructions to record the protest of their Government against the Italian proclamation of 3rd June respecting Albania. The Serbian Government desire to reserve the right of returning to the subject hereafter.Four Serbian officers in Petrograd informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador on the 18th that three Serbian Generals, 13 Colonels, a Major, and a Consul, have been sentenced to death, by7 the Court sitting at Salonika, on a charge of plotting to establish a Serbian Republic.   They begged that the British and Allied Governments might intervene3209-3 &apos;      cthere supported by French bayonets if there should be a majority against hum He has proposed to meet M. Jonnart, to discuss matters, at Keratsini.According to M. Rihot&apos;s public statement of the policy of the Allies, ex-King Constantine is left free to select his place of residence. Having compelled him to leave Greece, &quot; whither he will never return,&quot; France could afford to be generous. In the same spirit, M. Jonnart raises no objection, to the granting of passports for Switzerland via Italy to Messrs. Gounaris, Dousmanis and Metaxas on the under-standing that they7 go at once. He has handed to M. Zaimis a list of &quot; undesirables &quot; and other persons whose presence in Athens might endanger the interests of the Entente and of United Greece, denianding that 35 be exiled and 1.15 kept under close supervision.Ex-King Cohstantine and his family left Oropos in two Greek ships, escorted by French destroyers, on 14th June ; they landed at San Giovanni, opposite Messina, on the 17th, and proceeded to Switzerland on the following day7 via Chiasso.On 15th June M. Zaimis expressed to Sir F. Elliot his uneasiness at the proceedings of the French at Bineus, where, he believed, they7 had arrested some 60 Royalists denounced by the newly-returned Venizelist Mayor. The landing of the Allied troops was completed on the 16th ; a report by His Majesty&apos;s Military7 Attache states that it was marked by unimportant hostile demonstrations and local disturbances, from which a certain number of arrests resulted. A house to house search for arms produced some 3,000 rifles, 5 machine guns, a large number of revolvers, and some hand grenades.French troops occupied Volo without resistance on the 14th. At Larissa, occupied on the 1.2th, there was desultory fighting in which the French lost a few men before capturing and disarming the small Greek force opposed to them.There still appears to be some doubt as to the facts of the occupation of Preveza. The Italian Consul declares that a French detachment attempted to occupy the place on l^th June but that the local authorities objected to their landing. On 13th June, Baron Sounino told Sir R. Rodd that he could not believe that Italian troops had occupied the town ; a few gendarmes only7 had been landed at Parga. His Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consul reported, however, that a picket of Italian troops had entered the fort on the 12th ; this was followed by a popular demonstration against Italy and in favour of France. Eventually7 the flags of Greece, France, Italy and Great Britain were hoisted over the fort. On the lSth a further report from the same source reported that the town had been occupied by the French ; it confirmed the presence of the Italians at Parga. In this connection it is of interest to note that there is continued friction between the French and Italian military authorities in Corfu. Sir C. des Graz reports&apos; that General IViarro, head of the Italian Military7 Mission, is conducting energetic propaganda in the islands, and using Corfu as a base for similar activities on the mainland. The Italians also continue locally.to support the Royalist cause in Greek politics.The blockade was raised by order of M. Jonnart on 15th June. On the same day Sir F. Elliot presented Mr. Orackanthorpe as His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires to M. Zaiinis, and expressed the hope that, although M. Jonnart represents Great Britain, His Majesty&apos;s Legation might not be regarded as entirely negligible. M. Zaimis replied that he would be delighted to communicate freely with Mr. Crackanthorpe.In the opinion of M. Jonnart, as expressed to His Majesty&apos;s Minister on 13th June, the recently re-established. Allied controls might gradually be relaxed and eventually abolished. Sir F. Elliot fears that the High Commissioner is disposed to ignore His Majesty&apos;s Legation, even as regards the commercial control, and to take his own independent line. He also reported (15th June) that the Italians are apparently endeavouring to evade the shipping control of the British Port Officer.
and Lave the case tried before a bench of Allied judges. Sir G. Buchanan, in telegraphing their statement, observes that if they publish it, as they propose to do, in Petrograd, the effect on public opinion will certainly be unfortunate.BULGARIA.The weekly report on Bulgaria, issued by the Intelligence Bureau of the Department of Information, furnishes evidence indicating clearly that all political sections in Bulgaria, from Radoslavoff. the Prime Minister, clown to the Socialists, attach the very greatest importance to the retention of Serbia east of the Morava, or at any rate of a strip sufficient to bring Bulgaria into direct territorial contact with Hungary, and are agreed on the necessity of continuing in close political and economic connection with the Central Bowers, both in Eastern Serbia and in the whole of the Dobrudja, even as far north as Tulcea and Isaccea, the Bulgarian authorities are hard at work Bulgarizing the population.HOLLAND.Sir W. Townley has formally protested against the Dutch Governments intention to authorise the export of new potatoes to Germany, in violation of the terms of their agricultural agreement with Great Britain. He has pointed out that their proposed action might have very grave consequences. On the 19th the Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to give the matter his immediate attention.His Majesty&apos;s Government have received authoritative information that a large number of cattle (estimated at 250,000 head) are about to be exported from Holland to Germany because-of the alleged shortage of the hay harvest. Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to urge the United States Government without delay to intimate to the Dutch Government that no foodstuffs or fodder will be allowed to go from America to Holland unless satisfactory assurances are given that this export of cattle to Germany will not take place, and that the export of horses will also be discontinued. Sir C. Spring Rice observed in reply (20th June) that an intimation in the desired sense would, no doubt, be conveyed to the Dutch Government, but that some time must necessarily elapse before the prohibition of exports can actually be enforced.GERMAN AFFAIRS.The question of Alsace-Lorraine is occupying much attention in the German Press. An official wireless message reproduces at great length the utterances of Dr. Ricklin and Dr. Hoffel, Presidents respectively of the two Chambers of the Alsace-Lorraine Parliament, and the firm determination of the Province to remain an integral part of the German Empire. Dr. Hoffel laid stress on the great preponderance of the German-speaking population. - &quot;Official, enquiries;&quot; he declared, &quot;based on the &quot; national census, have shown that 87 per cent, of the inhabitants speak German, &quot; 12 per cent. French, and 1 per cent, foreign languages. These figures afford a &quot; sufficient indication as to the result of applying the principle of nationalities to the &quot; question. We are closely united to Germany economically, ethnologically and by &quot; our language.&quot;The officially subsidised &quot; Frankfurter &quot; (.14th June) observes that the Alsace-Lorraine Parliament^ assertion of its unswerving loyalty to the Kaiser and the German Empire is intended as a declaration of Imperial policy and a reply to the recent pronouncements of England, France and the United States on the subject. The retention of Alsace-Lorraine is therefore a fundamental plank in Germany&apos;s war programme. The writer of this article (Herr Stein, confidential Press worker for the Chancellor) deplores the unwillingness of the Allies ,l to listen to the sincere voice of a people who refuse to be liberated by them.&quot;The &quot; Bremen Burger Zeitung&quot; (organ of the Socialist majority party) has published an extremely-significant article (15th June) on the economic reasons which make it as imperative for Germany7 to retain Alsace-Lorraine as. it is for Turkey to retain, or regain, Mesopotamia. The &quot;Minette district of Lorraine is the most important source of iron-ore in the German Empire ; it ydelds fully two-thirds of the total German output of ore and nearly7 half the total of iron.   Moreover, Alsace-
Lorraine produces vast quantities of. potash, which, if transferred to France, would deprive Germany of her practical monopoly in the commodity and expose her to serious competition in the worlcbs markets. For France, with her less dense population and her wealth, says the writer, Alsace-Lorraine is not an economic necessity as it is for Germany.In the course of an interview sought by Lord Acton on 28th May, the Papal Agent at Berne (Mgr. Marchetti), a prelate thoroughly acquainted with men and affairs in Bavaria, stated that the scheme for the affiliation of the Reichsland to Bavaria dates from a time considerably anterior to the outbreak of war. The Bavarians considered themselves entitled to this enlargement of their borders because in the war of .1870 so many of their officers and men had fallen in Alsace-Lorraine. The plan actually dated from the Zabern incident, which proved conclusively that the existing regime in the Reichland had become impossible.The &quot; Tagliche Rundschau &quot; emphasises the importance of Germany&apos;s position, as the only exporter of potash. Coal, iron and potash, it declares, &quot; are the German peace &quot; weapons which she must take to the Conference and with which she must achieve &quot; a decisive victory in the event of a military stale-mate .... The Powers &quot; that are now fighting against us will need us as much as ever, no matter what plots &quot; they may now be hatching against us in Paris, London, Rome or St. Petersburg ; &quot; no matter whether they scrap their old free-trade policy and bury themselves up to &quot; their necks in protection .... Germany&apos;s peace trident coal, iron, and &quot; potash--that is the symbol which shall strike into the hearts of cur enemies fear &quot; greater than that produced by our German Siegfried sword.&quot; Clearly, to surrender Alsace-Lorraine would be to lose a prong of the trident.AUSTRIA HUNGARY.Vienna telegrams of the 19th June, ptrblished in the Hutch Press, report the resignation of the Austrian Ministry en bloc. The crisis was brought about by the Polish Party, which declined to be appeased in its demands for an independent and united Poland by the concessions which the Prime Minister had offered in regard to Galicia, Ac. According to the last accounts, received, the Emperor has instructed Count Clam-Martinitz to reconstruct the Cabinet, and negotiations ,to that end are proceeding.The &quot; Berliner Tageblatt &quot; gives the following list of the new Hungarian Cabinet :  Presicbmt and Minister for the Interior, Count Esterhazy ; Education, .Count Albert Apponyi; Post Office, Dr. Wilhelm Vaszonyi ; Finance, Dr. Gratz ; Defence, von Szurinay; Commerce, Count Serenyi ; Court, Count Bathyany ; Croatia, Count Aladar Zichy.SWEDEN.On 13th June the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement in both Chambers of the Riksdag in which he drew a gloomy picture of the increasing hardships to which Sweden is likely to be exposed by the combined pressure of Germany&apos;s submarine warfare and the Anglo-American blockade. The only hope or avoiding serious disaster, he said, lay in observing absolute neutrality and in maintaining trade as far as possible with the belligerents on both sides. His policy of strict neutrality and independence was endorsed, by the leaders of all parties.On 16th June Sir E. Howard again drew the attention of the Foreign Office to the assurances which, under instructions, he had given to the Swedish Government (in connection with the Kogrund passage negotiations) with regard to the facilities to be given by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the importation, in sound condition, of cargoes of grain then under order, or shipped, in America. It was then understood and agreed that if the Swedish Government carried out their part of the bargain in passing the British ships out of the Baltic, they might expect to receive 90,000 tons of cereals before the end of June. His Majesty&apos;s Government have admitted that the Swedish authorities are not to blame for the delays that have occurred in the despatch of our shipping from the Baltic (the actual amount of tonnage passed out was only 13,000 tons up to the 14th June) ; he considers, therefore, that the Swedish Government have a right to expect fulfilment of the undertaking that these grain cargoes should, be allowed to come forward. The tonnage of the cargoes actually released up to date is only 25,000 tons ;  moreover, the grain on five or six wheat
ships, long detained in United States southern ports, is reported to be heating and liable to become unfit for human food. Sir E. Howard therefore strongly recommends that these ships be released without further stipulation as to transit or other concessions by Sweden. The Foreign Office, while maintaining that His Majesty&apos;s Government have scrupulously fulfilled their obligations under the Kogrund agreement, desire to act generously in this matter ; instructions have been sent to Sir C. Spring Rice (15th June) to inform the State Department and the Food Controller at Washington that Great Britain is in honour bound to afford every facility for the import of these grain cargoes into Sweden. He was therefore directed to enquire whether the United States Government will allow them to proceed without delay to Halifax, where their clearance will be expedited. In reply, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador-observes (19th June) that, under instructions and in ignorance of the obligations incurred under the Kogrund agreement, he has been pressing the United States Government to stop all exports of cereals to Scandinavia. He requests that he may be kept informed in future of agreements, such as this, which bear closely on the-whole question of united blockade pressure.From reliable information received from two sources, Sir E. Howard, has reason to believe that considerable quantities of rubber and tin are being smuggled from Russia,. via Finland into Sweden, for shipment to Germany.NORWAY.The Germans have offered to release tbe S.S. &quot; Thoruun&quot; (vide Report No. IS)1 under certain conditions ; one of these is that in future Norwegian vessels will not resist capture within the four-mile limit. The Norwegian naval authorities report that the capture was actually effected within the three mile limit; on this ground fresh representations are being made to the German Government. Discussing the case in Parliament, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the President and other speakers dwelt with bitterness on the possibility of a Norwegian captain, and crew being-made to suffer for obeying the orders of a Norwegian warship in Norwegian waters.. Sir AI. Findlay reports that intense feeling has been aroused by this incident and by the sinking of Norwegian fishing vessels.The Minister for foreign Affairs informed Sir M. Findlay on 17th June that, in his opinion, a substantial basis for agreement had now been reached in the negotiations regarding coal and tonnage. He saw no reason to modify the existing British coal control; a statement ad referendum, recording the points mutually agreed upon as to its working, should suffice pending the conclusion of negotiations in London. The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, propose that the coal agreement should come into immediate effect, and agree to the simultaneous commencement of tonnage requisitioning. On the .18th this proposal was confirmed and. amplified by the representative of the Shipowners&apos; Association (Mr. Fearnley) who suggested that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the result of the recent negotiations as satisfactory, they should proceed forthwith to requisition Norwegian tonnage in the North Sea trade and replace it by British vessels, as proposed. The Association^ delegates desire at the same time to poslpone-negotiations in London until experience has shown what questions really need, further discussion. Mr. Fearnley considers that his presence is required in Norway to initiate the requisitioning arrangements ; he has, therefore, decided not to come to England at present. Sir M. Findlay is of opinion that as matters stand the result of the coal negotiations can be recorded in a formal agreement and the tonnage arrangements based on the correspondeuce exchanged, which would meet the views, of both Norwegian parties.DENMARK.Sir R. Paget reports that owing to the drought following on a late winter, the harvest in Denmark is likely to be a complete failure. At the present moment there-is a great, scarcity of good pasturage ; under these circumstances it is inevitable that Danish farmers will be compelled to reduce greatly their stock of horses, cattle, and pigs. A large portion of this stock will find its way to Germany. Recognising the difficulty of preventing this, Sir R. Paget suggests that it might now be advisable-
to encourage these exports to Germany on. a large scale, so that Denmark might not remain a possible reserve for Germany later on. There are, he thinks, obvious objections and obstacles to any scheme for the wholesale purchase of Danish cattle by Great Britain, though means should be found to limit the number of horses going to Germany hy bringing blockade pressure to bear from America in the matter of fodder supply. The reduction of Danish cattle and pig stocks would eventually mean diminished exports of butter and bacon to Great Britain. Before coming to any decision as to the policy to be adopted, His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to send an agricultural expert to report on the situation as a whole.SPAIN.A report, dated 7th June, by His Majesty&apos;s Military Attache at Madrid, dealing with the organisation and objects of the military Juntas centred at Barcelona, explains that the spirit animating the Spanish Army is but little removed from trade unionism. By measures deliberately framed for the advancement of their class-interests, the Juntas have now succeeded in turning the tables on the politicians, who until recently exploited, the army. Having been compelled to recognise the Officers&apos; Unions (which have made common cause with the revolutionary and republican parties), the Govern-menPs position has become undignified, not to say precarious. The recent growth of pro-Germanism in the army is almost entirely attributable to the fact that the late Government was pro-Ally, and to the army&apos;s consequent fear of becoming involved in the war. As Major Grant observes, fighting is intensely unpopular in the Spanish army. This is indicated, by the demands put forward by the Juntas, as follows :   (1) no fighting, (2) reforms in system of promotion, (3) better ]iay, (-1) better equipment, and (5) fairer distribution of decorations.On 15th June Sir A. Hardinge declared the situation to be more critical than was commonly realised, The non-commissioned officers and men have formed Juntas similar to those of the officers ; they appear to be imbued with the doctrines of the Petrograd Soldiers&apos; and Workers&apos; Council, for the rank and file have ceased to salute their officers, and on the 14th an infantry regiment at Carabauchel refused to turn out-for parade.CHINA.Under the forcible suasion of Creneral Chang Hsiin (acting in the capacity of mediator), the President dissolved Parliament by mandate on the night of 12th June. Accompanying this mandate, he addressed a circular telegram to the Provinces, explaining that he had been compelled to dissolve Parliament in order to preserv6 the Republican form of government, to protect life and j)roperty in Peking, and to prevent dissensions between north and south.Mr. Alston is of opinion that the southern provinces are not likely to rise in active opposition to the policy dictated hy the ex-Premier and. the Military Governors unless encouraged to do so from outside. Tor this reason he considers that the Note addressed by the United States to the Chinese Government is inopportune ; he is also of opinion that the northern military party would certainly misconstrue any statement by the Allied Powers (like that contained in the American Note), which might imply that China&apos;s entry into the war was of no importance.JAPAN.For one or two days, and especially while there was reason to think that the French Government were supporting the United States policy at Peking, there were signs of considerable agitation in the Japanese Press. Sir C. Spring Rice reported (15th June) that the Japanese Ambassador had protested to the United States Government on the subject of their Note to China. The State Department, in reply, declared that the communication in question had been perversely misreported in the3209-3 D
Press. Its only purpose was to convey a salutary and friendly warning to China, in which the other Allies could join if so disposed. Sir C. Spring Rice was informed that the United States Government suspected that the trouble had been deliberately caused by the organised activities of certain parties in Japan and America, desirous of creating ill-feeling between the two countries. On the 19th the State Department announced that the incident was closed.On 16th June the Japanese Government replied in brief but friendly terms to the United States proposal that the Allies should unite in impressing upon China advice similar to that contained in the American Note. They stated that in their opinion concerted action of the kind proposed is unnecessary, and that the position of affairs at Peking is not so critical as to justify interference. To Sir 0. Greene, the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed the opinion that after the dissolution of Parlia-ment the new Chinese Ministry, if satisfactorily selected, might be expected to declare war against Germany; if the signs were favourable, the Powers should then act promptly to secure the desired result. He thought it not improbable that General Chang Hsiin might be meditating a restoration of the Monarchy.SI AM.The Siamese Government are taking steps to replace German employes by British subjects. The German manager of the Siam Commercial Bank will thus be replaced. Mr. Gittens, a British engineer in the service of the Siamese Government, has been appointed adviser to the new Commissioner-General of Railways and will have control of both the northern and southern lines.Siam&apos;s intention to break with Germany and Austria has now been confidentially communicated to the representatives of France, Russia, Italy and Japan at Bangkok. The declaration of a state of war will be conveyed through the Siamese Minister at Berlin, but no date has yet been fixed. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked Sir H. Bering whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to receive the 271 German residents in Siam for internment in Australia, Siam defraying the cost of their transport and maintenance, a course which His Majesty&apos;s Minister recommends.The Siamese Government intend to requisition the nine German vessels interned at Bangkok and to pay for them after the war. Sir H. Dering has been instructed to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government would greatly appreciate the service if these vessels could be placed at their disposal as soon as possible ; care should be taken, to seize them before they have been damaged by their crews. His Majesty&apos;s Government would also be glad if arrangements could be made hereafter, when required, for the enlistment of Siamese labour battalions for service in France and elsewhere.ARGENTINA.His Majesty&apos;s Minister reports a serious strike at the meat freezing establishments at Zarate, which may endanger the supply of frozen meat. The Government have given police protection for the British works that might be endangered by riots.URUGUAY.The Uruguayan Government are creating an original precedent by their latest interpretation of neutrality in South America. Mr. Mitchell Innes reported on the 19th of June that they had issued a Decree establishing the general principle that, when an American country goes to war in defence of its rights, Uruguay will not treat it as a belligerent; decrees of neutrality in such case (he., as regards the United States) are declared to be without effect. At the same time the Republic does not intend to sever diplomatic relations with Germany.
SAN SALVADOR.His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Guatemala reports that the earthquake in San Salvador caused no loss of life at the capital ; about 100 persons were killed in the provinces. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at San Salvador stated on 14th June that earthquake shocks were continuing, and a volcano in the district of San Miguel was showing signs of eruptive activity.HAY 11.Diplomatic relations between Hayti and Germany were severed on the 18th of June, Germany having refused to guarantee compensation for loss of Haytian Jives and property resulting from submarine attacks.UNITED STATES.In view of the desire of the United States Government to afford facilities for the Hearst Press to be represented at General Pershing&apos;s headquarters, His Majesty&apos;s -Government have directed Sir C. Spring Rice to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to remove the embargo on Mr. Hearst&apos;s newspaper service and to accord him the usual privileges, on the understanding that public announcement will be made of the fact that this is done at the request of the United States authorities. Sir C. Spring Rice reports that in making formal application for re-instatement, Mr. Hearst has given definite assurances that his agents will obey the British Press CehsoPs rules, and that no alterations or additions will be made in any matter passed for publication.According to information conveyed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, the President has approved a plan for the formation of. a Polish Committee in London or Paris, with power to act as a Provisional Polish Government, borrow money, &amp;c. The plan was only at the initial stage, however, the President not having yet discussed it with the Secretary of State.Sir C. Spring Rice has been instructed to draw the attention of the United States Government to the continued rise in the price of raw cotton, a matter which is causing much anxiety to His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is commonly believed that the present abnormally high price is due to the operations of speculators, driven out of the grain market, who are concentrating their energy on cotton. If this belief is found, upon enquiry, to be based on fact, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador is to consult with the State Department as to the possibility of taking steps to control these speculative operations, both in the United States and Great Britain.The War Risk Bureau have drawn the attention of die Embassy at Washington to the large quantities of cotton recently shipped from New York to Italy, and have enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that these shipments are under proper control. Sir R. Rodd, consulted on the subject, reported (16th June) that the Italian Governments control of cotton re-exports, especially to Switzerland, is extremely strict.Sir C. Spring Rice announced on 19th June that the Export Restriction Bill had. been passed. Some time must elapse, however, before arrangements can be made to control the export of staple commodities to South America. Owing to the congestion of business in Congress, the &quot; enemy trading&quot; Bill is not expected to pass before the end of July. Meanwhile all United States shipping hues, except the Panama Company, are voluntarily observing the statutory list and referring all doubtful cases to His Majesty&apos;s Consulate General.THE  SHIPPING SITUATION.Sir A. Peel is informed that the Brazilian Government propose to hand over the interned German vessels permanently to the Brazilian Lloyd Line, reserving only four of them for use as transports attached to the Brazilian. Navy. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has assured the United States Ambassador at Rio that the -Brazilian Lloyd Line will cease to carry cargo of black-listed firms upon, the conclusion of their existing contracts.The Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs has notified Sir R. Baget that the German Government have now agreed not to interfere with produce boats outside the danger3209- 3 K
zone. There is therefore no further need for them to proceed through territorial waters. In return they stipulate for an increase in the number of Danish horses to he exported to Germany.The Swedish Lloyds are now showing commendable readiness to resume traffic with Great Britain, besides undertaking to comply- with the conditions laid down by His Majesty&apos;s Government, as to half cargoes for Russia, in their Transatlantic trade. Sir E. Howard reports that 14 of the Co.mpany&apos;s vessels will have cleared for the Enitecl Kingdom by the end of June.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Delegates continue to arrive at Stockholm and to discuss their several projects and programmes for peace, but the emergent total of definite ideas remains small, and the prospect of concerted action by the various groups of Socialists becomes increasingly remote. The Zimmerwald ultra-pacifists have received a severe blow in the expulsion of M. Grimm from Russia; the activities of this group at Stockholm had made them for a time serious rivals to the &quot; International. &quot; Bureau, so that their present chagrin is very pleasing to M. Branting and M. Huysmaus. The Zimmerwald Conference has now been postponed until 25th June, that is to say, three days before the opening of the Conference summoned by the Russian Sovyet. The Russian delegates had not arrived at Stockholm on the 17th, but were expected shortly. The American delegates arrived on the 18th. Their names (Max Goldfarb, Boris Reinsteiu and D. Davidovitch) are indicative of the cosmopolitan and largely Jewish character of American Socialism. A RussianMussalman delegate (Dr. A. Ibrahim) has announced his hope that the Socialist Conference will demand, the right of self-government for Mussalmans in French and English Colonies.The German Majority Socialists&apos; declaration of their peace programme and principles has been published in the Press. M. Thomas considers that its effect in Russia shordd be extremely advantageous to the Allies. Read in conjunction with Germany&apos;s alleged peace terms, as conveyed, through Grimm to Petrograd, the close connection between German official Socialism, and German Imperial diplomacy7 could, not fail to make its impression on public opinion in Russia. The reply of the Sovyet to Messrs. Thomas and Vandervelde on the subject of the Stockholm Conference (ptdfiished in Petrograd, 16th June) admits the right of Socialist parties to remain identified with their respective Governments, but finally declares that &quot; the Conference &quot; can only be successful if Socialists regard themselves as representatives not of &quot; belligerent factions, but of an undivided movement of the working classes towards a &quot; common goal of universal peace.&quot; In the pursuance of this aim they are confronted with the difficulty (as shown in the case of M. Grimm) of dealing with individuals or groups who may happen to identify the cause of humanity with that of a particular belligerent. Mr. Henderson met the Sovyet Executive Committee.on the 16th ; they did not impress him as a businesslike or capable body, and he considers that no good purpose would be served by endeavouring to establish more intimate relations with them at present.Concerning the German, peace overtures conveyed to Russia through the Swiss Minister at Petrograd and M. Grimm, the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir G. Buchanan on the 15th of the details of these proposals, involving an offer of financial assistance to the Russian Government, and an assurance that Germany&apos;s Avar aims do not include any enlargement of her territories or any7 economic or political expansion. In this connection, information from a reliable source goes to show that, at the recent conference of Austrian and German statesmen, it was decided that, in the event of Russia agreeing to a separate peace, financial assistance would only be given her if the new Russian Government would undertake to discourage ail movements in Germany or Austria directed towards Slav independence or autonomy.The comments of the German Junker Press on the peace terms offered to Russia afford some indication as to their ultimate value. &quot; Die Post,&quot; referring to the official statement of the &quot; Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; on the subject, observes that Germany has no intention of compelling by brute force the surrender of definite regions or economic resources, because she has every reason to hope that she may obtain from Russia by friendly agreement the concessions vital to her national existence. The &quot; Norddeutsche.&quot; it adds, does not suggest maintenance of the stains quo ante. The &quot;Frankfurter,&quot; presumably speaking for the Chancellor, observes that the peace which Germany is seeking is a peace not of dictation but of
mutual agreement. But it certainly does not imply that the status quo is to be restored. &quot; It is obvious that a peace arranged by Russia with us would automatically &quot; produce a general peace such as Russia desires, and there could be no better way &quot; of. convincing the Entente of the correctness of the Russian Governments views than &quot; the prospect, if the others refuse, Russia will act independently by the light of her &quot; own conscience.&quot; On 16th June the Central Committee of the National Liberal Party in Berlin re-affirmed the maintenance of their annexationist programme.At the request of the Sovyet Committee, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has granted a passport for England to M. Earbman, Petrograd correspondent of the &quot; Alanchester Guardian.&quot; The Committee proposes to send other similar emissaries abroad for the purpose of persuading Allied democracy- that the cause of the war is not German aggression but the Imperialism and capitalism which dominate the Governments of all the belligerent countries.Air. Grahame reports that the rumour about M. Caillaux&apos;s political activities was unfounded.   He has not gone to Switzerland.Prince bulow, at Bucerne, is reported to have been in constant communication, by special courier service, with Rome. Sir H. Rumbold also states that the Brovost of the Hofkirche at Lucerne has paid two visits to the Vatican on behalf of Prince bulow.GENERAL.On 14th June Sir W. Townley was officially informed that the German Govern-ment had accepted the proposal to meet representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at The Hague to discuss questions connected with the treatment of prisoners of war and interned civilians. The German officials selected are Major-General Friedrich, Dr. Eckhardt, of the Foreign Office, and Major Draudt. The British representatives, who will arrive at The Hague before the end of the week, are Lord Newton, General Belfield, and Sir Robert Younger. The German Government suggest that the Netherlands Minister, M. Vredenburgh, should assist at the negotiations ; they propose to discuss the following qrrescions :  (1) Resumption of exchange of civilian and military prisoners which had already been arranged ;(2) Extension of exchange of civilian and military prisoners ;(3) Extension  of  internment  of civilian  and   military  prisoners   in  neutral countries ;(4) Release of medical personnel, civilian clergymen&quot; and civilian doctors still in the hands of the enemy.The British delegates are instructed, to discuss also the following questions : Barcels for Prisoners of War, Punishments of Prisoners of War, Reprisals on Prisoners of War,Delay and failure in reporting capture of Prisoners of War.Arrangements for the proposed meeting were suspended between the 14th and the 19th June to permit of discussion of the matter with the French Government, whose objections were evidently overcome. The hitch was attributed by the Dutch authorities to the recent air raids on London.The Foreign Office instructed Mr. Grahame on the 19th to enquire whether, as reported, the Freuch Government are actually holding up parcels for German prisoners of war until the delivery of parcels to French prisoners in Germany shall have been regularly resumed ; if so, His majesty&apos;s Government desire to know the results in due course.A further emphatic protest has, been addressed to the German Government, through the Netherlands Legation at Berlin, against the continued interference with parcels addressed to British prisoners of war. Brisoners recently escaped from Germany have reported that, for various and wholly7 unconnected reasons, and without any justification, the German authorities have held up and disposed of parcels at six different camps.
