I would remind the Cabinet that when this Northern Barrage was originally discussed, the possibility of -extending it, either by agreement or otherwise, into Norwegian waters in order to bar the passage of submarines was considered.   It was however finally decided that the wiser course would be to stop the Barrage short of territorial waters, and as soon as it became effective, prevent the enemy from using Territorial waters by the very means whioh we are now pro-posing to adopt.      The Barrage is becoming effective, and the enemy submarines  - as proved by the reports of our own Submarine Patrol Commanders - are going through    Norwegian Waters, and I recommend the Cabinet to authorise the steps advocated by the First Sea Lord.   Whether the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would concur in the very short notice of three days recommended on Naval grounds, in the last paragraph of the First Sea, Lord&apos;s Memorandum, I do not know, but it is of importance that the Norwegian Government should be urged to take very      prompt and effective Measures, failing which we must do so ourselves.. IIC GEDDES,31st July, 1918.
h( s f; c r e t. 29&apos;  INFRINGEMENT BY T3E ENEMY OF THE TERRITORIAL WATERS 0? NORWAY. Memorandum by the First Sea Lord for.the War Cabinet.The time has arrived when the subject of the neutrality of Norwegian waters should be re-considered.The steps wlvoh have been taken by the Allies to refuse the passage of the enemy&apos;s submarines round the North of Scotland into the Atlantic are being stultified by the persistent use of No wegian Territorial Waters by these vessels/   Of this fact we have ocular proof obtained from our submarine natrols.Under these circumstances,, the Admiralty consider that it should be brought to the notice of the Norwegian Government that not only is it committing an unneutral act by allowing the enemy1s submarine forces to pass through their waters in order to reach their hunting grounds, but that it is also shutting its eyes to the deliberate infringement by the enemy of the Norwegian Royal decree of October 15th, 1916, relating: to&quot;the passage of submarines through Norwegian Territorial Waters tThis communication should be accompanied by an offer of assistance on the part of the Allies to Norway to close the passage through her Territorial Waters by Mines; and in defaultmay be quoted the precedent set by Sweden and Denmark in laying minefields in their own waters and in blocking the Kogrund Channel at the enemy1 s bidding,ofSuch an accession to our defensive measures would be/the very greatest assistance In the anti-submarine campaign.It is difficult to believe that Norway could take any exception to such action on the part of the All? es, for not only is it to her interest that enemy&quot;submarines should not be allowed topass freely into the Atlantic, but it is also against her national dignity that the enemy should, contemptuously brush aside her restrictions as to neutral waters..It is no more permissible for a neutral to allow belliger ent men-of-war to use Territorial Waters as a means.to get to end from the prospective sphere of operations than it is ft r a neutral to allow the passage of troops to go through their terrain for a similar purpose,&quot;It may be explained that this measure, if carried cut would not create any difficulties so far as neutral shipping is concerned5 because  here would still remain clear for them a passage North and South through the Norwegian heads; a passage which&quot;coulctoob be used by submarines except on the surface.The United States Naval Authorities are whole-hearted advocates of this measure, realising that the results of their exertions in producing andlaying a vast quantity of mines are largely reduced by the inertia of NorwayftIf this step were taken, time would be an important factor in the negotiations.    Norway should be given a time limit of three days in which to decide on her action,&quot;with a clear understanding that unless at the end of that period she is ready to take her own measures, we shall commence the operation of mine laying.(Signed) R.
