/This Document is the Property^ 365His dritannic Majesty&apos;s Government ,Confidential.LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(31st July 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-STRIKES. Statistics for the Fortnight ending the 24th July.During the fortnight ending the 24th July 1918, 68,320 working days-a little over one-fifth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on Ministry of Munitions work. The most important loss of time occurred at Coventry and Rugby, where 10,01)0 skilled workers lost 20,000 clays as a protest against the Ministry&apos;s embargo policy.&apos;&quot;&apos; At Sheffield moulders, first of all 1,500 in number and later 1,700, lost 14,700 days on account of dissatisfaction with an award. A demand for the discharge of a foreman at the Close Works of Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd. (G-ateshead-on-Tyne), caused a strike of 2,000 engineers, who lost 8,000 days.The Embargoes.Mistaken Criticism. In the course of the dispute which came to a head at Coventry, and extended to . Birmingham and other places, the suggestion was made that the laying of embargoes on a few munition firms was an arbitrary act, sprung upon the workers, without adequate notice, for the purpose of surreptitiously restoring the conditions which existed before leaving certificates were abolished, and so introducing &quot;the thin end of the wedge of industrial conscription.&quot; For any such statement there is no foundation At the time, of the withdrawal of the leaving certificate provision, it was announced by Mr. Churchill in the House of Commonst that some measure of the hind would be adopted if the necessity for it arose. As far back as the 11th September 1917 a memorandum was sub-mitted to the Trade Union Advisory Committee explaining the Ministry&apos;s embargo proposals, and the Committee approved the principle, while reserving judgment as regarded its detailed application. Again, on the 16th April 1918, a proposal to enlarge the embargo scheme was submitted to the Committee, together with other proposals for increasing the enrolment of War Munitions Volunteers. The proposed extension of the embargo attracted little notice and no protest, and a resolution was passed, covering the two schemes, to the effect that some such measures were called for. The embargo policy was yet again explained to the Committee on June 5th, 1918, and was once more received without protest. It was also explained in the press on June 8th.The press was in error in stating that the labour representatives had demanded that the administration of the embargo scheme should be &quot;entrusted to local labour committees. The suggestion for local committees was made in discussions on the War Munition Volunteers Scheme; so far as embargo was concerned, they were not mentioned until the actual outbreak had taken place. VWhen the embargoes were brought into operation, the very small scale on which action was taken gave sufficient proof that the plan had no provocative intention and was being applied in such a way as to interfere with the liberty and convenience of,only an irreducible minimum of workers.   The number of firms on the Munitions Arka Recruiting List* The strike at Birmingham against the embargo is not included in these figures for the week ending the 24th July, as the Birmingham men did not cease work until the evening of the 24th. t See Hansard, August 15, 1917, col. 1306. a  (33)6289   Pk 20   125   8/18  E &amp; S
2is about 32,000; the number of firms which have actually been embargoed is approximately 100. In Coventry itself, the number of firms affected was only four out of a total 390, and in two of these four cases licences permitting the employment of about 300 additional men had been issued before the crisis arose. Moreover, the scheme was already in operation, by agreement, in the London sheet metal trade. It is clear, therefore, that this is a case in which agitators deliberately exaggerated for their own purposes, and there are many indications that the underlying motive was a determination to obstruct the further progress of dilution. Resolutions of refusal to teach dilutees were a feature of the agitation against the embargo scheme in more than one centre.Influence in the Workshops. The chief difficulty of the Ministry in dealing with the embargo dispute at Coventry has been the impossibility of discovering any authority representing the workers which had any influence over their action. The executive councils of the trade unions maintained an attitude that was absolutely correct, but they were repudiated by all those on whose behalf they undertook to speak and negotiate. For all practical purposes the matter passed from their hands to those of the Coventry Engineering Joint Committee.* This body proposed to suspend the men&apos;s notices in order that it might have time to organize a more formidable movement throughout the country ; but many of the Avorkers were too impatient to brook even that delay. Instigated by various works committees and associations of shop stewards, they threw over the Joint Committee also, and decided to strike at once. An aggregate meeting of members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and other unions resolved that all A.S.E. men and skilled men at Coventry should remain oat until the embargoes were removed. About 8,000 out of a possible total of 20,000 did cease work; and a large number of workers at Birmingham followed their example.One cause of the irritation is stated to have been that some men who had been promised employment by the firms on which the embargo was placed, found that the application of the embargo prevented them from taking up tbjir new jobs. The number of men thus affected was very small, but the consequences of their indignation were out of all proportion to their numbers.A Golden Bridge. The threat to withdraw protection from military service from, strikers who did not return to their work within a stipulated time was clearly warranted by the circumstances. Men are exempted from their military obligations in order that they may work, and not in order that they may stroll about the streets or agitate against the Government. At the same time it was desirable to avoid the irritation which would have resulted if the men&apos;s surrender had been attributable solely to that menace; and the Minister agreed with the Trade Union Advisory Committee to appoint a committee as soon as work was resumed, to report upon the conditions which had rendered the embargoes necessary. This furnished the men with a golden bridge over which they could retreat with dignity and in good order, as in fact they did. It also served to affirm and re-establish the prestige of the executive trade union officials, who as soon as the agreement was reached were enabled to supply energetic and useful help in securing a resumption of work, on that basis.The Aircraft Strike.Rock, the shop steward, whose conduct was the principal cause of the strike at Messrs. Waring &amp; GuTow&apos;s aeroplane works, has now been dismissed. In dealing with the dispute it was agreed by the Ministry to hear unofficial representatives of the men if they were brought by the responsible trade union leaders. In agreeing to this, the Ministry merely followed the precedent which has been adopted both by themselves and the Ministry of Labour in countless labour troubles.   It was on its own responsibility that the Ministry decided, on considering* This body is composed of representatives from the official district committees of about fourteen skilled unions. Its original function was to provide for joint consultation with the local employers, and any agreements arrived at were subject to confirmation by the executives of the separate unions. For more than a year, however, the Committee lias striven to establish itself as the final executive authority in the district.By request of the Coventry committee, the embargo question was taken up by the National Engineering and Allied Trades Joint Committee (whose headquarters are at Leeds) and the National Committee circularized local committees throughout the country with a view to exerting combined pres-sure. The National Committee represents an association of local bodies similar to, and including, the Coventry Engineering Joint Committee, and its policy is the devolution of executive authority to local committees of engineering and allied trade unions. Of late it has shown considerable sympathy with the unofficial shop stewards movement.
3863the whole position, to take over the management of the works. This automatically reduced the strikers to the status of unemployed persons who might, if they chose, apply for engagements in the new establishment. It was open to Mr. Rock to apply with the rest, but it was made clear that he could not be engaged till the Ministry were in effective control. The effect of this, which was fully explained to the men, was that Mr. Rock would not be taken back with the others on resumption. They accepted the settlement on this understanding, and on the further understanding that if the inquiry went against him his dismissal would follow. He applied and was taken on when the Ministry had assumed control. The results of the inquiry were unfavourable to him, and his dismissal followed.IL-COAL CONTROLLERS AWARD.A reference has been made in these Ndtes&quot;:i:&quot; to the demand of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain that the recent wage increase granted by the Coal Controller to coal miners shall not be limited to coal miners, but shall be granted to other members of the Miners&apos; Federation who are employed on Ministry of Munitions industries. These industries fall into five groups : (1) coke-oven and bye-product plants ; (2) ironstone mines ; (3) fire-clay mines and fire-brick works ; (4) limestone quarries ; and (5) non-ferrous mines. The Miners&apos; Federation cannot be regarded as the most representative union in any except the first of these groups.! In some cases the wages of the workers have followed wage fluctuations in other trades e.g., the blast furnace sliding scales  and hence the provision of equitable war wage advances has been a matter of great complexity. An agreement has now been entered into by the Ministry and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain (applicable only to members of the Federation) whereby it is hoped many potential causes of friction will be avoided. The agreement covers nearly the whole of the workers involved in the present discussion. It will allow, where proper, of the adjustment of fixed prices or of financial assistance to employers paying the Coal Controllers advances to (1) ironstone, limestone, and lead miners (provided that no advances have been received since the previous general increase); (2) coke-oven men and bye-product workers; &quot;and (3) fireclay, silica and ganister miners not covered by the Committee on Production award in the clay industries. The conditions under which the advance will be applied to the second group are under discussion with the unions directly concerned. The terms of the agreement exclude workpeople whose wages have in practice been regulated according to wage movements in trades other than the coal trade or the trade in which they are actually engaged.III. TIMEKEEPING.Three months have elapsed since the new scheme for the promotion of good timekeeping, involving the withdrawal of protection certificates from bad timekeepers, was put into operation. During that period a marked improvement has shown itself in every district in the country. The figures sent in by investigation officers  not exhaustive, but affording a sufficient sample of results obtained establish the following conclusions : (1) The average percentage of cases sent to the Enlistment Complaints Committee to be considered, either for prosecution or for withdrawal of protection from recruitment, was only 15 &quot;6. This varied from 43 &quot;5 in West Midlands to 3&apos;7 in London.(2) The average percentage of cases in which improvement was effected was 60&apos;8, varying from 87 &quot;7 per cent, in the South-western area to 28 * 2 per cent, in Wales.   In London and Scotland the percentage was close on 80.(3) Before warning, the average loss of time (per week) was nine hours ; after warning, the corresponding time for some weeks was 2&apos; 3 hours, showing an average gain of 6&apos;7 hours per week, per head. The most marked improvement was in the North-western area, -where the loss fell from 11 &quot;0 per week, per head, to 2&quot;3 hours. In the London area the gain per head was seven hours per week.* 3rd July 1918.f The Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain has an approximate membership of 800,000 workers. Its power is due mainly to the fact that almost all underground colliery workers are organised in the trade unions affiliated to it. The workers referred to in the text are a small minority of the total membership, but the Federation claims that the Coal Controller&apos;^ award should be paid to all members alike.
