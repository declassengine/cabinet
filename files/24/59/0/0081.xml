I WISH to bring before the notice of, the Committee for Home Affairs the question of London University. It will be within the recollection of the members of the Committee that a Royal Commission, under the Chairmanship of Lord Haldane, was appointed in February 1909, to &quot; enquire into the working of the present organisation of the University of London, and into other facilities for advanced, education (general, professional, and technical) existing in London for persons of either sex above secondary school age ; to consider what provision should exist in the Metropolis for University teaching and research; to make recommendations as to the relations which should in consequence subsist between the University of London, its incorporated colleges, the Imperial College of Science and Technology, the other schools of the University, and the various public institutions and bodies concerned; and further to recommend as to any changes of constitution and organisation which appear desirable ; regard being had to the facilities for education and research which the Metropolis should afford for specialist and advanced students in connection with the provision existing in other parts of the United Kingdom and of our Dominions beyond the Seas.&quot;2. This Commission issued its Final and unanimous Report on the 27th March, 1913, and a Departmental Committee, under the Chairmanship of Sir George Murray, was appointed in August 1913, to &quot; report as to the steps by which effect should be given to the scheme of the Report of the Royal Commission on University Education in London, and to recommend the specific arrangements and provision which may be immediately adopted for that purpose and as a basis of the necessary legislation.&quot;3. A report, drawn up at my request by Sir George Murray, and appended to this Memorandum, will show the Committee the outline of the problem with which the Departmental Committee were dealing and the steps which had already been taken before the outbreak of war suspended its operations. We have now to consider whether the Departmental Committee should be invited to resume its work, and I agree with Sir George Murray in thinking that it will be useless to invite the Committee to reassemble and to invest any more&quot; labour in the London University problem unless the Government sees its way to sanction the expenditure which will be involved by the adoption of the recommendations of the Royal Commission. If the Government is prepared to go on with the London University scheme, the sooner the Departmental Committee gets to work again the better. Sir George Murray and his colleagues are now in possession of the complicated range of facts and considerations bearing upon the problem, and every year which elapses with nothing done will make it more&apos; difficult to resume the work at the point at which it has been interrupted.4. The arguments for proceeding to carry out the recommendations of the Jioyal Commission may be briefly summarised as follows : (i.) The present constitution of the London University is admittedly bad and cumbrous. The Report of the Royal Commission suggests a form of constitution more effective, more respectable, and more conducive to the educational autonomy and development of the constituent colleges.(ii.) At present the constituent colleges of the University are widely scattered, with the result that there is very little University atmosphere, a good deal of inter-collegiate jealousy, and a very considerable amount of avoidable overlapping in functions. The Report of the Royal Commission recommends the establishment of a University quarter and the removal of King&apos;s College from its present site in the Strand to a site in the proximity of University College. The concentration, of University education in the neighbourhood of the British Museum and the construction of an impressive group of University buildings upon an appropriate site would undoubtedly give the University a larger influence in the life of London and of the Empire. I may add that the creation of a University quarter upon the site in Bloomsbury was unanimously recommended by Sir George Mur.ray&apos;s, Committee.[643]
2(iii.) At present tire medical schools of London aro il] organised and, in spite of their incomparably larger and more varied opportunities, were, in the years preceding the war, completely outstripped by the medical schools of Paris and Vienna in their power of attracting advanced students from all parts of the world. At present a large majority of the medical students in London are merely taking a minimum professional qualification and are not receiving a University education at all. Indeed there is no University standard, no central control. The General Medical Council supervises examinations but not teaching. The intermediate and clinical subjects, though improvement has taken place under the Board of Education Grants, are not properly taught. There are two or three standards of examination and qualification, arid although Medical Research has been organised under the Medical Research Committee of the National Insurance Act, which spends some 58,&apos;OUOZ. per annum in the. co-ordination and remunera-tion of research work throughout the United Kingdom, the system, does not yield its full results in London, partly because the clinical teachers are not whole-time teachers but busy doctors or surgeons, partly because there are too few teachers, and partly because the spirit of research can only be adequately implanted in students who have been properly taught and upon a University standard. Indeed it may be said that the superb clinical opportunities offered by the London hospitals are only used for the purposes of the higher scientific study of medicine to a fractional measure of their full value. The Commission propose to remedy this discreditable state of things by placing a limited number of highly organised medical schools under the direct control of the University, and it may be added that a sufficient number of satisfactory medical schools have already intimated their desire to come under the scheme recommended by the Commission. Under this scheme the professors of clinical medicine and surgery will no longer be overworked practitioners They will be professors properly appointed, adequately paid, and charged with the responsibility of appointing their own assistants, demonstrators, &amp;c. There will be no in-breeding, no age succession, no proprietary patronage; the best men in. Europe or America will be attracted, if possible, to the task of explaining and commenting on the clinical material in the London hospitals. There will, in other words, be an end of all petty patronage, (iv.) At present the machinery for training advanced students in science is fatally injured, by reduplication&apos;, and consequently by insufficient staff and equip-ment. Even already the new and complex problems of modern industrial research are making demands far beyond those which the London University can meet.&quot; The adoption of the constitution proposed by the Commission would necessitate a reorganisation and allow a natural expansion of the scientific energies of the University, which are at present dispersed and unco-ordinated.(v,) At present the metropolis of the Empire offers no single intellectual centre for the meeting and exchange of experience between students from different parts of the Empire or from abroad. The establishment of a flourishing and active University in London would remedy this serious Imperial Aveakness.(vi.) It is of the utmost urgency that this country should, Avithin the next five vears, spend on its universities on a scale more nearly approaching that of other civilised nations, but it is impossible to spend money in the provinces and to avoid spending it in London, and to spend more money on London, as it is, avouM increase rather than remove the present disorganisation, duplication, rivalry, and waste.5. These are the principal arguments for proceeding to give effect to the recom-mendations of the Royal Commission. If the Government is of the opinion (a) that there should be a single University in London, and (61 that the University should be assisted by the State in the manner suggested by the Commission, and if it is known that the Government intend to give effect to their decision most of the opposition will disappear.   At the present moment opposition may be expected : (i.) From the Senate of the University, which is divided on the desirability of .   reconstitution;(ii.) From the &quot; External &quot; Students, who are nervous lest any change may tend to loAver the estimation of the University of London Degree ;
3(hi.) From the Imperial College of Science and Technology, which is opposed to the recommendations of the Halclane Commission that they should be an integral part of the new University; and(iv.) From Guy&apos;s Hospital, which, being the only medical school which has never applied to the Board of Education for grant, is opposed to any extension of University control over medical schools. Sir Edwin Cooper Perry, the present Vice-Chaneellor of the University, is Superintendent of Guy&apos;s Hospital, and is understood to take this view. . Sir George Murray&apos;s Committee had, however, succeeded before the war began in proposing arrangements which had practically removed all opposition to medical reform, except in the case of Guy&apos;s, and which held out promise, in the opinion of Mr. Sydney Webb and Sir Albert Rollit, of agreement with the &quot; External&quot; party. The only serious difficulty that remained in July 1914 was the Imperial College of Science and Technology, which will certainly refuse to come in now, but may reconsider the position, when once the reformed London University has proved its value.G. The annual cost of giving effect to the proposals of the London University Commission, as estimated by themselves, was 99,0001., to which must be added at least 30 per cent, if the increased costs clue to the war are to be met. The Departmental Committee have also recommended the reorganisation of five medical schools as colleges of the University, instead of three as proposed by the Commission. For the two additional colleges an additional annual sum of 31,0001 will be required. A rough estimate of the cost of putting the Commissions recommendations into effect will therefore be: (i.) Annual contribution, 160,0001.(ii.) Contribution to site for the University and for King&apos;s College, net, nil; gross, 455,000?.(iii.) Special contribution to central University buildings, say, 250,0001.The cost of the site for the central buildings before the war was, as Sir George Murray shows in his memorandum below, 211,0001 ; as a set-off to which the Govern-ment would obtain the land and buildings at South Kensington worth (including rates and upkeep) an estimated annual sum of 11,5951., i.e., somewmat more than the new site calculated at 20 years&apos; purchase. The remainder of the Bloomsbury site, viz., 71 acres (gross), would be sufficient to provide a new site for King&apos;s College, and would ultimately cost 244,0001. ; but as an offset to this the sale of the site and buildings in the Strand would, in Sir George Murray&apos;s view, provide enough money to pay for the additional land in Bloomsbury and leave something over, towards the cost of new College buildings.These amounts are necessary for reorganising the University on the lines of the Commissioners&apos; Report. The University as thus reorganised would require the same consideration for further developments as the other Universities in any new scheme affecting this grade of education as a whole.7. I fully realise that a London University Bill framed upon the lines of the Report of the Commission could not be introduced unless it were an agreed measure, and in any case could hardly be introduced this session. My object in bringing the matter before the Committee now is to ascertain whether the Government would be generally prepared to support, the reform of London University on the lines recommended, and to sanction the expenditure involved in carrying out the scheme of the Commissioners should it be found possible to obtain that measure of general agreement which it was one of the objects of Sir George Murray&apos;s Committee to negotiate.H. A. L. FISHER.July 31, 1918.Report by Sir George Murray.The President of the Board of Education has asked me for information as to the progress which has been made with the proposed reorganisation of the University of London.The Royal Commission, presided over by Lord Haldane, issued its final report in April 1913.In August 1913 Mr. Pease appointed a Departmental Committee to report &quot; as to0
4the steps by which&apos; effect shall be given to the scheme of the report of the Royal. Coin-mission on University Education in London and to recommend the specific arrange-rnents and provisions which may be immediately adopted for that purpose and as the basis of the necessary legislation.&quot;. The committee consisted of Sir L. A. Selby-Bigge, Sir John Rose Bradford, Sir William McCormick, Sir George Franklin,* Dr. Arthur Keith, Mr. -John Kemp, and Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, with myself as chairman. Our- first meeting was on the 14th October, 1913, and we continued to meet until the third week in July 1914, when our proceedings were interrupted by the outbreak of war.We presented a first report on the 20th April, 1914, which dealt with the question of a site for the University buildings. This report was submitted to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer bv Mr. Pease with a memorandum dated the 12th May, 1914.Our recommendation, which was supported by Mr. Pease, was that negotiations should be opened forthwith with the trustees of the Bedford Estate for the acquisition of about 2\ acres of land lying immediately to the north of the British Museum. The estimated cost at that time was about 211,0001.As a set-off to this expenditure the Government would be able to resume possession of the land and buildings now occupied by the University at South Kensington, the annual value of which (including rates and upkeep) was estimated at .11,5951. We were further of opinion that it would not be prudent to acquire a new site for the University headquarters, unless arrangements could be made for re-housing King&apos;s College on adjacent land ; and we therefore recommended that the negotiations with the Bedford Trustees should include an option to purchase additional land in Torrington and Woburn Squares lying immediately to the north of the site contemplated for the University. By this means about 5 acres of building land (or 1\ acres if gardens and roads were included) would be obtained at an estimated cost of 244,0001. If King&apos;s College were thus provided for, the Government would receive in exchange the present site and buildings of the college on the east side of Somerset House. No estimate has been made of the value of the property, but it would probably be worth more to the Government than to any outside purchaser ; and it is thought that, after providing for the cost of the new site, there would be a surplus sufficient to cover a considerable portion of the cost of the new buildings.The Committee also carried on prolonged negotiations with the medical schools attached to the various London hospitals, with the Imperial College of Science and Technology, with Bedford College, the East London College, Birkbeck College, and other bodies likely to. be affected by the reorganisation of the University.The negotiations with the medical schools were&apos; approaching a satisfactory conclusion, and the negotiations with other bodies did not present any insuperable difficulties, except in the case of the Imperial College of Science and. Technology, which appeared to be unwilling to fall in with the proposals put forward by the Committee.,I have little doubt that the Committee, if so desired by the Government, would be ready to resume their labours ; and I think that there is a fair prospect of a successful result. But difficulties must be anticipated with the Imperial College, the City and Guilds of London Institute (which is closely connected with the engineering department of the college), and with the representatives of the &quot; external &quot; students.The financial provision for the reconstituted University would probably need reconsideration. Lord Haldane&apos;s Commission contemplated an increased expenditure by the Government of about 75,0001 per annum. In view of the rapid development in applied science which may be expected after the war, and of probable demands in other quarters, I think it will be necessary to make a substantial addition to this estimate, apart from the cost of the site.. On this latter point, however, it is, in my judgment, absolutely essential, that a decision should be arrived at before any further steps are taken. Until the question of the site is settled, and a definite announcement made by the Government on the subject, it would be useless for the Committee to resume its negotiations with the several bodies interested in the future of the University.G.
