\ T -        aOMMUNICATIONS TO   BE ADDRESSED  TO THE   GEIMEHAL  SECRETARY.TELEPHONE MUSEUM 3184.TELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS&quot;prolific, ox,LONDON.&quot;EVELYN  HOUSE,62, OXFORD STREET,LONDON, W. 1,July 22nd, 1918.RESOLUTION.WL\)tim early in 1917, Mr. Bonar Law, Chancellor of the Exchequer, declared on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, their adherence to the Principles of Imperial Preference, and of the Paris Conference Eesolutions, 1916, and on 13th May, 1918, their intention to denounce all commercial treaties containing &quot; most favoured nation &quot; treatment.3Utt Mljmas on the 18th July, 1918, His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in answer to a question announced in the House of Commons that none of these commercial treaties have been denounced, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer also in answer to a question-made a statement to the effect that the Imports and Exports Control Bill cannot be further considered, nor any statement as to the Governments Economic Policy made until after the recess.3ltt0 tlljmas Lord Kobert Cecil is reported in the &quot;Times&quot; of July 19th, 1918, to have made a statement to the correspondent of the Associated Press of America dealing&apos; with the Allies&apos; Trade Policy.The BEITISH EMPIBE PBODUCEES&apos; OEGANISATION representing the bulk of the producers and manufacturers of the whole Empire, views with dismay and alarm the continued delay on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government in deciding upon and making public the Economic Policy under which these industries are to be carried on after the war. They urge on behalf of the interests they represent: 1. That the innumerable Committees appointed by the Government to investigate and report on industries have reported, including the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy After the War, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government are now in possession of all the information necessary to enable them definitely to decide on, and announce their policy.2. That further delay will accentuate the feeling of anxiety and distrust daily becoming stronger among all classes of the com-munity in this country, the Overseas Empire and Allied countries.
3. That it is imperative that a public declaration of their policy shall at once be made, in order to secure that this country shall not enter upon the Economic struggle which must follow the war, at a serious disadvantage compared with competing countries, all of which, including enemy countries, have been busily engaged in perfecting their arrangements for the rehabilitation of their industries and resumption of their trade.4. The British Empire Producers&apos; Organisation having carefully considered the report of the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy After the War, while of opinion that in certain particulars it is not wholly satisfactory, desire to support its main conclusions. They however, make the following recommendations: 1. That Agriculture, Food, Sugar, Meat and Timber should be added to the list of Essential Industries calling for special treatment.2. That under no circumstances should alien interests or capital be allowed to control the development of Empire resources, and that it is more important to develop British resources with British capital, than to protect British capital invested in developing foreign industries.3. That Enemy Aliens should be dealt with as recommended by the Dalziel Committee, subject to the following amendments : recommendation 3.amendment &quot; That all certificates of Naturalisation granted to enemy aliens since January 1st, 1914&quot; read &quot;January 1st, 1910.&quot;recommendation 4.amendment The qualification should be &quot; prior to January 1st, 1910.&quot;recommendation 5.amendment for august 1st, 1914, read january 1st, 1914. recommendation 6.amendment for august 1st, 1914, read january 1st, 1914.
Recommendation 10.Amendment-For August 1st, 1914, read January 1st, 1914.Omit the words &quot; until six months after the signing of peace,&quot; and for the closing words &quot; until that date &quot; read &quot; until such time after the war as shall be subsequently approved by Parliament.&quot;Recommendation 11.Amendment--At the end add the words &quot; such actual period not to exceed six months &quot;Recommendation 12.Amendment After the words.&quot; all branches or agencies &quot; insert the words &quot; Financial institutions and trading firms.&quot;4. That past experience has proved the Banking system in. this country insufficiently elastic for the needs of industry, and that it will be quite inadequate to the demands after the war, even with the added facilities of the British Trade Corporation. They recommend to the serious consideration of the Governments of the Empire the establishment of an Imperial Bank of Industry on the lines of their Scheme already laid before them.5. The British Empire Producers&apos; Organisation is unable to agree with the recommendation in paragraph 226-227 and 351 to the effect 1.   That protection shall only be given where an industry proves that it is efficient and unable to fight foreign competition.(They believe that the Report has entirely overlooked the effect of Preferential Tariff Treatment in lowering the cost of commodities by increasing production, and in giving that security to industry which is necessary to attract capital and induce the highest efficiency in production. They recommend that each industry should be dealt with on its own merits and that industries shall be stimulated by adequate preferential tariff treatment where there is reason to believe that production can be efficiently or economically increased within the Empire). To wait until an industry has proved that it is unable to meet foreign competition, would be to give competitors a start in the commercial struggle which it would be difficult if not impossible to overtake.Finally the British Empire Producers&apos; Organisation recommend 1. That Allies and Neutrals should only be admitted to trade in this country on equivalent terms to those on which this country is
admitted to trade in those countries, and under no circumstances on as good terms as those under which other parts of the Empire are admitted to trade here.That no enemy subjects should be admitted to trade in this country for a period of at least 10 years after the war.That rates of inland rail and water carriage shall be revised to make it impossible for goods from overseas to be delivered at inland points cheaper than Home produced goods.That rates of ocean freights shall be so regulated as to make it impossible for the freight charged on British goods ^o^^^^^l-British Ports to be greater than that charged to &quot;epm foreign ports.That production and conservation of minerals and raw materials of the Empire shall be promoted and safeguarded for the use and benefit of the citizens of the Empire first.That British capital shall be utilized first for development of British resources.That British goods shall be carried in British ships.That the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government shall be specifically directed to the attainment of these ends.C. SANDBACH PARKER,G liairman.
