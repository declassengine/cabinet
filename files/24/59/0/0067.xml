.x/ l, \Mftiralty Men&amp;ranflun for t)ao Imperial War Cabinet.fe?AlLThe Admiralty desire to bring to the notice of the Imperial Weir Cabinet the attached important and instructive paper written by Adxriral Sir Edraral Slado, and in doing so they wish to endorse in the strongest manner possible, the general principles and general conclusions set forth therein.There are certain statements in this &quot;docuraont which are irrefutable and which the Admiralty look upon as questions of primary policy and strategy.   It cannot be ttd emphatically stated that the holding in our hands of the motive povfer of sea-borne traffic - coal - has been one of the weapons whioh, for many a long year, has proved of inestimable value in that Maintenance of.sea power on which the whole edifice of the Empire  ests. Never has this been more strikingly demonstrated than during the last four years of War.The gradual substitution of  Oil for Coal will in the future, if the question is not immediately faced, wrdst from our grasp one of the principal factors on which the maintenance of our Naval position depends. The case as stated in the paper is sufficiently alarming to make the question one for immediate decision olse we may find ourselves out-manoeuvred not only by the enemy but by neutrals or even by our present Allies,It is understood thfci a discussion will shortly take place on War Aims which must include the retention or otherwise of Mesopotamia, and it is hoped that in reviewing this question the extreme importance of that oountry in regard to the Petroleum situation will not be lost sight of.(signed)   R.E. WEIffSS.PETROLED!! SITUATION III THE BRITISH EUPIiC,50th July 1913.Forwarded,(signed) ERIC GEDEES,
PAPDR BY ADMIRAL SIR SDMOND SLADE ON THE 203ESPROLEOM SITUATION IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE.There aro two main points of view from whioh the study of the Petroloust situation in tho British Empire must bo considered. The first and most important is tho strategic and the second is that of supply.  The two aro to a groat extent interdependent, but the quostion of sufficiency of supply may bo satisfied without the strategic position, for which wo ought to strive, being obtained.During tho war we have boon able to Maintain our control of the shipping of the world through our control of bunker fuel and whether bunker fuel ofthe future is to be oil or coal, it is essential that wo retain the command of it.   If we lose it, half our sea power is gone and our position may become a most precarious ono.   It is no exaggeration to say that our life as an Empire is largely dependent upon our ability to maintain the control of bunker fuel,. As improved methods of using bunker fuel are adopted and vessels aro able to travel further for a given weight of fuel, tho problem becomes more difficult and it becomes more&apos;important to us to find a solution that will enable us to retain the control.Oil fuel used as a means of raising steam is about twice as ee^pmical as ooal and? used in an internal combustion engine, about four times.  Oil must therefore gradually take the place of ooal for all marine purposes and it is consequently of paramount importance to us to obtain tho undisputed control of the greatest amount of Petroleum that wo oan.  This control must be absolute and there must bo no foreign interests involved in it of any sort or kind, otherwise wo shall find those interests using every means at their disposal, honestly or dishonestly, oponly or secretly, to hamper tho development of British interests.Also they might and. probably would be guided in their policy of development of oil territories by their private interests and not by what is best in the national interest.  For instance, assuming they hold largo producing wells (which means cheap production) in say Mexico, they would neglect development of oil fields in say Trinidad, Canada or Nigeria, if the wells in those fields wore of smaller calibre.   It is quite conceivable that they would adopt this policy even though tho latter, wells could be worked remuneratively, although not at such a high rate of profit as the former and notwithstanding it was in tho national interest that they should be developed.It must be remembered that vast sums of money are involved. At the present moment foreign interests aro taking between SO and 25 million sterling a year from, this country out oftho profits of the oil business and they arc not going to give up any part of this large profit without a very determined struggle.  If the British Government&apos;can obtain the control of any source or sources of supply that will provide a material proportion ofthe Petroleum requirements oftho Empire, then it is obvious that the predominence now enjoyed fey foreign oil corporations will bo a thing of the past and wo snail be masters in our own house in all matters relating to oil, which is not the case at present.  Then and then only will the strategic position bo secured and we shall be able to look forward with confidence to maintaining our hold over the sea communications ofthe world in tho event of another war breaking out.The main sources of supply of the United Kingdom, before the war woreThe United States 62.3$Roumania 11.6$Russia ?.7$Netherlands Colonies 7JiMexico 4.1$Other Countries 6.5$
a* &apos;    &apos; 204j.Jalcintf other parts of the Empire, India ifl mainly supplied from Burmah, the Dutch East India?, Persia and to a minor extent from tho United States.  Australasia draws its requirements from the United States; and tho Dutch East Indies. Canada from her own fields and the United States.  South Africa from the United States and the Dutch East Indies.*In those remarks it is not proposed to consider individ-ual products, hut to confine then to the broad question of Petroleum generally and the prospects of tho fields being able to continue the necessary supplies and to indicate where future development should bo sought for.flhen we endeavour to estimate the capacity of the various fields to supply our wants, it is of no use to take the output of each country and conclude? if It is large, that we can draw ample supplies from it.  The figure we have to consider is the exportable surplus, which is a totally different one and which is in raany cases an extremely disappointing one.During the years immediately prece ding the war, The United States exported approximately 20$ of its output, Roumania 50$, Russia 0$, Mexico 50$ - the remainder being consumed in the local markets&apos;, but only a small proportion of tnis exportable surplus was delivered lo tho United Kingdom and the rest of tho British Empire.   The following table shows the amounts in round figures In tons for 1913.Total output  Export able surplus. A^unt, r e ceiy ed- by, UJ:K K33,150,000 7,120,000 16$ of total or 1,100,0001,880,000 &apos;940,000 19$      -do-        230,0008,370,000 670,000 19$       -do-        130,0003,480,000 1,740,000 4$      -do-         70 000l,500j000 8$ -do-        125,000Canada takes approximately 9$ and tho remainder of the British Empire about 5$ of tho United States total exportable-surplus.   This is approximately a total of 2,100,000.The effect of the war has boon to change very consider-ably tho sources of supply, because both Russia and Rounania have been cut off and, owing to enemy action, it lias become necessary to supply the Western Area from the United States and the Eastern Area and most of the Mediterranean from- the Dutch East Indies9 Burmah and Persia, thus dislocating oxisting arrangements for the distribution of American and other oils.This dislocation will probably cease to bo so acute-soon after the war comes to an end and the causes which have brought it about cease to operate,   There are, however, other conditions of a far more radical kind, which will not come to an end with the war and which it is necessary to consider in order to form some sort of an estimate of the Petroleum.position ofthe futuiie.The first and most important factor is the life of the United States fields.  The situation is causing a groat deal of anxiety in the States and the President ofthe Standard Oil Company lias made somo very pessimistic statements on the subject.   The United States Senate ordered an enquiry into the Gasolene (motor spirit) question and at the beginning of 1.916 the Secretary ofthe Interior presented his report m which it is stated that most of the) fields have reached and passed their prime and are now on thedownward grade. That this is so is shown by the statistics of production which, notwithstanding the constant development whihichis going on, shows a steady decline in some ofthe older fields He estimates that the reserves lie between 7.000 and 10,000 million barrels (42 American gallons) (900,000,000 and
7 I 5   1&quot;!hi3.1,300,000,000 tons).   Otlior estimates place tho reserves between 10,000 and 25,000 million barrels (1,300,000,000 and 3,300,000,000 tons).   The present consumption is at tho rate of about 360 million barrels (50,000,000) a year including export, so that the estimated reserves at tho lowest figure will only last 20 to 25 years and, as the yearly oonsui-^tion rises, it will bo proportionately less.   Exports aro at the&quot;rate of 60,000,000 barrels&quot;(over 8,000,000 tons) a year and it is to be expected that these will be curtailed as soon as conditions become serious.   As is at present, notwithstanding that the United States are eking out their reserves by importing Mexican crude at the rate of 4 million tons a year? the constoption is greater than tho production and stocks are being reduced.&quot; It is therefore Safe to assume the United States authorities will not sit still and see the Petroleum resources of their country endangered, but that within a measurable period, say 10 years, the amount of the Petroleum that we shall be&quot;able to draw from the United States will be greatly diminished if not entirely stopped.   Tho following  tables gives the important figuresEstimated amount of ^exhaustion and reserves still available inthe United States oil fields.Taken from the report to the Senate of the Secretary of the Interior in 1918,Field.

The prolactioiyis not rising and in any circumstances it is probable that the whole of the output will, with the increase of industrial developeiiient in Russia, continue to be absorbed in that country.   It is also evident that the efforts of the Central Expires must be to divert to their own needs whatever exporta-ble surplus there may be available in order to make up for the loss of Petroleum from the failing Galician fields.The Roumanian fields have also apparently reached their , prime and the rate of production, even before the war, was showing signs of dminu tion.   Here Germany has imposed onerous i terms which they hope will secure the bulk of Roumanian Petroleum for the German Empire.   Whether tho policy of the Central Empires I   will be maintained or not, the claims of the local markets will inevitably draw more and more Roumanian products to themselves and decrease the surplus available for export over sea.   No increase of supply can therefore be expected from Roumania, oxuite apart from any&quot;question of x^olitical control.
204.In Mexico there is a very large field yet untouched, American geologists estimate the Mexican Petroleum Company  and its subsidiary the Huasteca Petroleum Company have an undeveloped supply in Tamoico of 750,000,000 tons, the Mexican Eagle Ooiqpany 450,000,000 tons, the Shell Company 150,000,000 tons, the other Companies about 67,000,000,&apos; This represents a probable reserve of between 2,000 and 5,000 million tons&quot;.It is however highly probable that the greater part of this supply will be taken        by the United States.   At the present moment she absorbs 75$ of the exportable surplus and as Stocks in the United States decrease and consumption increases, it is almost certain she will take more..   In considering Mexican figures it must be remembered that a groat part of the crude is of a very low grade and only yields.j60$ of usable oil and therefore a considerable reduction must bo made on the gross figures.The export of the Dutch East Indies to this country is only Sfo of their total production, the remainder being absorbed in local markets and markets nearer the source of production,   It is therefore improbable that wo can expect to obtain much relief from there.   The total production also is not large enough even if the whole of it could be taken to provide more than a very small proportion of all we want.The Burmah fields are not capable of great expansion and in any case Indian markets will probably absorb tho greater part of their production.The present imports of Petroleum into the United Kingdom is approximately 6,000 ,000 tons a year namely -Fuel Oil 4,300,000 tons Motor Spirit 750,000   11&apos;Xerosine 600,000   &quot;Lubricating Oil 350,000   &quot;6,000,000 tonsThe consumption of Petroleum products in the United Kingdom after the war may be estimated at very little less than our present war requirements.   Motor traction will far more general than it used to be for two reasons1.   The large reduction in the number of horses available both for road and agricultural purposes,2.   The large number of motor vehicles of all kinds that will be put on the market by the State when the Array is demobilised. These will be sold at lev/ prices and will be bought up by anybody who has need  of- transport, either for business or pleasure.The consuiiiption of fuel oil will be largely increased from what it was before the war, owing to the number of vessels that are being-converted to burn oil in place of coal.   The economy of this fuel, when once it is experienced, will induce those Companies who have been forced to adopt it now, to retain it after the war if possible.   The Naval demand will be greatly decreased, but the saving on this account will be to a certain extent absorbed by the requirements of the Mercantile Marine,   Therefore we may estimate the demand to be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 3/2 Million tons a year which, with a million tons for building up stocks of Naval fuel and 1/2 million tons for other products, will give a total cf 6 million tons ayear to be provided in 1 round figures., for the United Kingdom and for bunkers in the Western area.
i9 0 9In addition to this there are the requirements of the Dominions, Colonies and India.   The latter, including Railways and bunkers may bo placed at 1,500,000 tons to be provided from Burmah, Persia and Borneo.   Australia, Mew Sedand, Ceylon, South and East Africa 2,000,000 tons including bunkers.   Hong Kong, including bunkers 500,000 tons.   This gives a total of 4,000^000 tons or a grand total for the Empire of 10,000,000 tons ayear and in five to ten years time this may be expected to be largely increased.It is obvious that the sources of supply fron which we drew our requirements before the war will not/be sufficient to give us this enormously increased amount and we must look to other sources from which it can be drawn.It is hero necessary to remark that we roust also consider what other counties will require and what effect their competition for the rimited available supplies will have on our policy.The United States are building up a very large shipping trade:   their demands   for Puel Oil and other Petroleum products will be much higher than it was and will increase the already enormous consumption in that country and hasten the time when exports will be seriously curtailed.Germany is building a large mercantile marino and intends to compete with the Allies for the control of the carrying trade of the world.   Motor traction in the interior will also largely increase for the same reasons as it will in the United Kingdom. Tho exportable surplus from Russia, Rouiaania and Galicia and the produce of her own wells are not sufficient to supply her demands and she must therefore compete for the exportable surplus of other countiies,Germany also realizes from hdtter experience the effect&apos;of our control of coal and she will hesitate at nothing that will prevent the control of liquid fuel from passing into our hands and will endeavour by every means in-her power to secure it for herself. She has already established a hugh State monopoly Company by which the Government is to control the whole of the Petroleum policy of the Empire.   What this policy will be need not be expatiated upon, but it will be followed ruthlessly and with the whole of the resources of the State behind it.   The procedure may be expected to be much the same as that followed, by the German Government in pressing and supporting German interests in their endeavour before the war to wrest the control of the freight market from Britain shipping firms.In Prance, Italy and the rest of Europe the demands will be greater than they were before the war and except in Russia and Roumania, they have to be met almost entirely from outside sources.It is therefore clear that competition will be most severe and that everything possible must be done to secure our position if we are not to be left behind in the struggle.The undeveloped Ail fields of the world which promise to give large supplies, so far as is at present known, lie in Persia, Mesopotamia, Venezuela, Colombia and Central America,The Venenuela field is mainly held by the Royal Dutch and they state that it is going to be a very large one.   So far it has only been partially proved, but there is no reason to doubt that it will&apos;&apos; be of considerable importance, but in peace time the oil produced from it would, for geographical reasons, be very largely &quot;absorbed in the United States and Central and South America.
2086.The Columbian and Central American fields arc falling into tho hands of American Companies and it may bo considered that tho whole of their resources v/ill also bo called upon to make     ,good the deficit in the United States.   In any case the exportable surplus from those fields and from Venezuela will not be large enough for some years to come and it is only reasonable to expect that it will be absorbed by neighbouring markets in Central and South America and in the United States and will not be available to any great extent for our requirements,In Persia and Mesopota: -ia lio the largest undeveloped resources at present known in the world.   An area has been proved and is now developed in Persia which will, i-    at the end of this year or so soon as the necessary plant will have been delivered, be capable of supplying more than the whole of tho Roumanian and Galician fields put together, * There is besides another proved area on the borders of Persia and j-Iesonotariia which promises to be a very large field.    Between these two areas are numerous fields and there is every reason to expect that the yield from them will he very large.   There are also many known deposits of oil in other parts of Persia and Mesopotamia which will form reserves for the future, when they are once developed so -as to bring them into bearing.It is not too much to estimate that the oil lands of Persia and Mesopotamia which win extend over an area of 360,000 square miles, or more than twice *   the size of the oil lands of Russia, should not in the future provide1, a supply equal to that now given by the United States.If this estimate is anywhere near the truth, then it is evident that the Power that controls tho oil lands of Persia and Mesopotamia will control the source of supply of the majority of the liquid fuel of the future.   If this control is combined with that of coal, then that Power will hold the control of bunker fuel and will be in a position to dictate its own terms to all shipping in case of war.   we now hold that control through coal and it is absolutely essential for the national safety that wo do not part with it nor share -it with any foreign Power whatsoever. We must therefore at all costs retain our hold on the Persian and Mesopotamia^ oil fields and any other fields which may exist in Nv the British Empire and we must not allow the intrusion in any form of any foreign interests, however much disguised they may be. We shall then be in a position of paramount control of the majority of all bunker fuel for many years to come and enjoy all tho advantages that this will give us if we find ourselves forced into another war,   These advantages are very great and we cannot expect to enjoy them without making some sacrifices for them and we must be prepared to defend our claim against everybody.   Conventions and Treaties are only pom or ana can be torn up and are not sufficient safeguard,   Vq must have absolute security in this matter.   It we admit foreign interests at all, those interests even if apparently in a small and unimportant proportion now, will always be working against us-and will in the future, when the lessons of this war are forgotten, gradually absorb the controlling situation because the chief end and aim of&apos;the foreign oil interests is V/orld Monopoly,   Y/e have the object lesson of German penetration into the shipping and other commercial interests and we must not allow it to be repeated.The loonopoly in Germany previously referred to has been granted to a very powerful Petroleum Syndicate which has been formed under the auspices of the Deutsohes Bank and the leadership of von Riedermann, Ballin ana Stinnes,   It has acquired the undertaking of the so called German American Petroleum Company and the recently acquired Germans interests in the Roumanian oil fields.   The creation of this powerful Syndicate at the present time shows clearly that Germany recognises the groat strategic importance of
2&quot;097.securing a dominating position in the control o.f jxil supplies and that we must take proqpjr action if our oil position is to be safeguarded,The interest that is most inimical to British control at the present time is the Royal Dutch Company which holds a controlling interest in one of the most important of the so called British Companies.   This Company is in intimate relations with and trading with Germany so far as it can without danger of being black-listed and it will almost certainly re-open with the new Syndicate the negotiations, which       were in progress before the war and whioh have since been suspended, for securing closer relations with German oil interests.   One of the stipulations put forward by the Germans in connection with these negotiations was  , that the German Government should be given the right to nominate a director of the Royal Dutch Company with certain powers of control, German oil interests are now centered in tho new Syndicate which is in effect a German Government monopoly and it. is quite obvious that if Germany cannot obtain the coveted control directly as the result of a victorious war, she will endeavour to obtain it through peaceful penetration.So far as the conduct of the war is concerned, tho retention and development of the Persian oil lands is absolutely essential to the carrying on of the Mesopotamia!! expedition,If they are interfered with in any way, the British Forces in the Middle East will have to retreat.   The effect of such a contingency on our .        position in the East would nothing short of disastrous and might well lead to most serious complications in India,   Besides this the whole of,our oil policy would be destroyed and our control of the bunker fuel of the future would be rendered jjupossible.   The present fuel position in the Mediterranean and Italy would be seriously jeopardised and industry in India would be greatly crippled,Of other minor fields that are not yet&apos;1&apos;   developed, there is the Papuan, which promises to be able to supply a certain proportion of the Australian requirements.   This must also be kept out of the hands of foreign interests.The Nigerian and Gold Coast fields do not show any signs of being huportant producing areas at present, but the development should be pushed on as fast as possible by British interests.Hew Brunswick is now being examined, but it is too early to give an opinion on it.   The oil shale in this area may prove to be worth development for the supply of local markets.The   Argentine field is a promising one and is being steadily developed, but it is falling into the hands of German and Dutch interests who are said to have secured considerable rii]Jhts in it.The production in Japan is steadily increasing and is now in tho neighbourhood of half a million tons a year.   The Sapanese have unfortunately secured an option on the oil lands in British North Borneo and they are busily engaged in prospecting in that region.   It was a most injudicious action to have ever allowed them to come in.   If there is a large reserve of oil there, it should have been retained for British requirements.   If there is not, the Japanese will use the concession as a stepping stone to further undesirable action.There is said to be oil in Portuguese West Africa. Tivaour, Madagascar, Algeria and a few other places, but so far as ig at present known none of these deposits&quot;are lxkoly to give large outputs.
A. jhi 18.. In conclusion tho policy I would urge upon the Admiralty is1, To  press the Government to take the most energeticmeasures to prevent the eneroy in any way from endangering the oil fields and works in Persia. This is indispensable to the success of the war.2, To push forward as soon as possible the furtherdevelopment of the. oil lands of Persia and those in Mesopotamia by purely British interests,OftTo push forward the exploration and development of allpossible oil lands in the British Empire by purely British interests.lh To encourage and assist British Complies to obtain controlof as much oil lands in foreign countries as possible, with the stipulation (to prevent control being obtained by foreign interests) that the til produced shall only be sold to or through British oil distributing Companies.   These oil lands can be developed to assist to. tprovide our requirements in peace whilst our own resources in British territory can be consarved for war.To exclude from participation in British Petroleum business all foreign interests in an/ shape or form, such participation being only a stepping stone to ultimate control and a very greatdanger in any future war.(signed)   3.
