The women were busy thistle pulling among the potatoes, and cleaning out ditches.     The cattle are progressing satisfactorily.Heath Hil^L.    As a result of the showery weather during the week, no progress was made with the hay crops with the exception that a few more acres have been cut.    Another settler has arrived on the Colony with his wife, who is a Land Army women, and desirous of working on the eBtate.     They are in occupation of one of the cottages.Patrinffton.      The farming operations for the week consisted of hay making, mowing thistles on grass, hoeing roots, earthing up potatoes, ploughing fallows, emptying yards and leading and spreading manure.     The weather has been very stormy and rainy, whioh has very much hampered the completion of hay-making operations.     The crops produce and Btook disposed of during the woek included 48-J qrs. wheat, 15 qrs. beans, 2 stone rolled oats, 64 lbs. butter, 170 pints milk, 124 chicks, and 1202 eggs.Tithe. Commons.

Among the miscellaneous work undertaken by. the Branch is the drafting of a plan to illustrate a report which is being prepared relating to the proposed drainage of Pens JCoss in the counties of Salop and Flint.As a result of the increase during recent years in the yield from investments of money in gilt-edged securities, a revision of the Board&apos;s scale of compensation for enfranchisement under the Copyhold Act, 1894, has become necessary, and the matter is now under consideration.Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture and FisheriesLetters and enquiries received have centred mainly on the question of wages, cheese and winter milk prices.    The leaflet on &quot;Parasitic Mange1&apos; in Horses has had a very wide circulation, over 100,000 copies having already been distributed, and every effort is being made to give this important matter adequate publicity. Considerable anxiety is being expressed as to the provision of an adequate ration for agricultural labourers in remote rural districts, owing to their inability to supplement their rations with the ooupon-free provisions now available to the population of urban districts.&apos;Pig Produotion Section.There still appears to be a great difficulty experienced by pig keepers to obtain feeding stuffs for pigs.    In one oase a Priority Certificate could not be met after reference to the Provincial Feeding Stuffs Committees    Difficulty is also experienced in obtaining material for the construction of pig sties.    Inquiries show that at Bedford pig clubs have been started, and a Municipal Piggery established.    A meeting was addressed by an Officer of the Board at Wendover and a Resolution was passed with the object of the formation of a pig club.    At Colchester Piggeries have been started and the allotment holders are taking up pig keeping.

The usual enquiries bearing directly and indirectly on agricultural publications have been received and dealt vith by the Branch.Commercial Control firanoh.The work of the Branch during tho week, in addition to enquiries and correspondence as to the improvement of rural transport and extended commercial control after the war has consisted principally of correspondence on matters arising in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Aot.     One consent to a prosecution under this Act has been issued. The Branoh has also been engaged on work in connection with the Advisory Committee on Disposal of War Stores for Agricultural Purposes.Pisfyer^es Division.idministrative Seoti,on.      Various applications for the extension of the Salmon Pishing Season are under consideration.     Special regard has to be paid to the Local River Conditions in dealing with each case.   There is still a large correspondence on matters of general administration, but nothing oalling for particular mention.Sennit Section.     87 Permits have been issued and 21 canoelled.    A Notice prohibiting trawling   in an area off Newhaven has been issued to fishermen in the district concerned.    A Notice re drifting mines has been issued to Bast and South coast fishermen.     Owners of fishing boats likely to be interested have been notified of an additional area off the North ^est Coast of Scotland in which line fishing may be carried on.    A report has been received giving details of the saving of the life of a Canadian array airman by the owner of a small yacht fishing under an amateur fisherman^ permit.    Information given to the Naval Authorities enabled the machine to be salved.^ gjshermen1s Registration and Recruiting Section.   The following points in connection with the administration of Reserve P. 125 are under consideration in the Department:-(l)   The extension of the share system to all ratings on steam trawlers and drifters, particularly those to be manned after release from Admiralty servioe.(2)   The energetic extension of instruction in the use of the motor both through schools and itinerate instructors.(3)   The recognition of service on motor boats in the case of men above a oertain age, or whoso circumstanoes are such as entail exceptional hardship if they are called, as exempting them from call to commissioned trawlers and possibly also in certain cases to Trawler Seotion.
1 9/S(4)   The institution of motor boat fishing under Reserve P.124, regard being had to tne advantages of the squadron system and the discipline of fishing Under orders.A draft of Reserve F.125 men has been nominated to Admiralty for call to Section &quot;TM.    The Board have concurred in the call to Reserve F.124 of certain men from Hull and Grimsby,tot or Loan Committee.An interesting exaapla of how the Committees activities become known in outlying districts has occurred during the past week The son of a Kingfs Lynn fishermen who is at present engaged on a mine sweeper recently had his base changed to Yarmouth and there saw several of the Committee^ motor boat sat work.    He sfcde enquiries and got into touch with the Committee&apos;s mechanic stationed in the district.    As a result of the interview the mechanic proceeded to King*s Lynn and there addressed a group of interested fishermen on the quay on the subject of motors.    He found that the time was ripe for motors at the pert, and it is confidently expected that a large number of applications will come in very shortly.    Missionary work has been delayed at King&apos;s Lynn owing tt the difficulty of obtaining suitable engines for the vessels, for the size needed is one for which there is a steady demand all round the coast.    It is however hoped that satisfactory arrangements may be made to insure a supply which should be adequate unless the demand becomes abnormal.Freshwater Fish Committee.The Sub-Committee on Sels has this week presented its recommendations on Romney Marsh.    The Committee is somewhat perturbed by hearing that it is possible that two of its most important members may be called for Military Service and, should these gentleman be so called, it is highly probablekthat the work of the Committee will require to be suspended and its fruits lost. The Committee has addressed a letter to the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries requesting him so to amend their t^rms of reference as to enable them to bring questions affecting salmon into their final report.fish Food Committee.Russian fishing has again engaged the staff for the greater part of their time, as a boat is sailing this week from London carrying over 100 tons of material supplied by the different Firms.    Information has been received that another boat will probably sail at the end of next week, which will mean elaborate arrangements for the dispatch of goods to that ship from the different firms.ufho normal work of the Board is prtceeding on lines as indicated in previous reports.6th July, 1918.Secretary.
