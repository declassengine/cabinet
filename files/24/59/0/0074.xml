4.AMERICAN TROOPING.The Admiralty have now limited the number of troop ships sailing in any one oonvoy to 14. As a result of this 4 vessels had to disembark their American troops and 2 others, which would have carried troops, had to proceed without them, thereby reducing the number embarked by 6,800.   Owing to this and to unavoidable causes, it is not now anticipated that more than a total of 185^000 American troops will embark in British ships during the month of July, If the American estimate of 90,000 to be embarked in American tonnage proves correct, the grand total embarked during July will be approximately 275,000 as against 276,372 In June.

As an additional precaution, arrangements are being made to put a special Officer on board all trans-Atlantic vessels carrying more than 1,000 troops.   His sole duty will be to see that proper arrangements are made for boat stations and that boat drills are systematically carried out, CROSS CHAgffgL TROOPHC.Four American ships for Cross Channel trooping have now arrived at Southampton. HOSPITAL SHIPS IK THE ATLANTIC,The War Staff of the Admiralty have not yet come to a definite decision as to the procedure to be adopted in connection with these ships.
