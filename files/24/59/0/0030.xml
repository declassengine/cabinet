(1).24th July, 1918.Sir, v.;I beg:to submit the following Report on the work of the-Food Production Department for the1 week ended 23r,d July, 1918:-IThe Weather.ir - n i   -i    j. ja . i    i - n at&apos;   &apos; The rains which have fallen throughout the country duringthe past week appear to have caused little permanent damage either to standing crops or cut grass, ;7hile oats, potatoes, roots and pasture land have derived considerable benefit from the rainfall.&apos;&apos; YHieat crops especially are standing we^l and continue to be very promising. :LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. -  -Essex.   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of the following properties:-(1)   A farm of 400 acres at Peldom farmed by a business man who is the owner of 285 acres.of It.   The farm is stated to be in a very bad condition ov;ing to the inability of the occupier to manage it.(2)   80 acres forming part of a farm of 100 acres at Tollesbury occupied by an oyster dealer.     The whole farm Is very foul with the exception of one field which was fallowed in 1917 on behalf of the occupier by a member of the Executive Committee.(3)   24 acres of derelict building land at Southminster.(4)   46 acres of fallows, part of a - farm at ilorth Fambridge which the owner-occupier is unable to cultivate hLmself.    Theas 1&quot;*
Committee propose to cultivate these fallows in the summer and!f to retain possession until after the harvest of 1919. IfemjDshire,   The Committee have been authorised to take possess!! of 28 acres of arable land, forming part of a 64 acre farm owne and occupied by.a woman whose husband is in the printing trade, There appears to be no chance of the arable land being brought into a satisfactory state of cultivation while in the hands of jjfj owner and her husband. Drainage of Lands -   In the North Riding of Yorkshire the Commii have commenced clearing the channel of the River Severn, one of; tributaries of the Rye and Derwent system.   In Cambridgeshire a I report has been received by the Executive Committee from the Ada Committee comprising the leading surveyors and estate agents in county in which attention is drawn to the vital necessity of improving the arterial drainage.   The Advisory Committee mentioi illustrations two parishes, Swavesey, where about half of the 2, acres of grass land was under water at the time of their survey winter and Pen Drayton where 490 acres out of 600 acres of grass!&apos; was under water&apos;.Determination of Tenancies.&quot;- During the week 3 Orders have been authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 336 acres,HORTICULTURAL DIVISION, Royal Visit to Allotments - On the 20th inst,, Their Majesties King and Queen inspected allotments situated at Putney Lower Col Wimbledon Park (including the Piggeries and the Rabbitry), Mertc Park, and Clapham Common.   The tour proved a great success and Majesties expressed satisfaction with the arrangements which liai been made for the tour from which they had derived both informal and enjoyment,**2**
126Provision of Land for Allotments * Reports received from.1,181 -......--I&quot;&quot;.......11,1,1............&quot;&apos;&apos;.....1....................................-districts show that 312,769 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No;2), &apos;and.2$7,626 plots containing 20,717 acres,.have been provided. . -During the week ten Local Authorities have .agreed to&apos;-acquire in addition to the area mentioned above, 76 acres (947 allotments) including 13 acres at Aylesbury and&apos; I3i acres at &apos; Netherfield (Notts.).Fruit Section - As the result of an enquiry which has been made.as to.the provision of&quot; baskets at Hull it was found that five trucks per week are. required to. remove the empties from the London Market, The North&apos; Eastern&apos; Railway state that there Is no shortage of -trucks for this purpose, but-that the difficulty lies in.the fact that the Great Northern Railway are unable-to accept them in London owing to the congestion of traffic there..22.6 demonstrations In&apos;Fruit Preservation have been given during the week&apos;in various parts of the country, and exhibitions have been held&apos;at Coventry and Derby. &apos; &apos;  -Marketing - Essex/ The organisation is-progressing&apos; favourably, a Market Manager having been appointed,    A local dppofc for the sale&apos; of produce is under consideration at Southend.Norfolk.   The Horticultural Sub-Committee have handed over,the Marketing arrangements to &quot;the Eastern Counties&apos;Produce Co-operative Society at Ipswich, and depots have already been opened at Norwich, North Walsham, and Fakenhain and others will shortly be opened at King&apos;s Lynn and East Dereham-.Worcester,    The auction mart was formally opened with great success by Lord Coventry on the 16th inst.Cambridge    The auction mart during the week has done trade to the extent of  290,An arrangement has been made with the Ministry&apos;0f National Service whereby any stalls or depots opened by the County Marketing Societies shall not be deemed new businesses, and will not, therefore, come under the recent order restricting the opening of new businesses,-3-
&quot; TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection of Land. (1) In the course of an inspection of land in Dorset on the 20th inst.j a case was noted which illustrates the way in which a farmer who was determined to make the best o his newly ploughed land dealt with a field which want of labour presented him tackling earlier in the season. The farmer, who milks over 70 cows on less than 300 acres of land, broke up several pasture fields in the early winter. -Two of these whic were seen were carrying fine wheat crops. A third field of 9 could only be partly ploughed in the spring; 4 acres were plan with potatoes at the end of April. 2f acres of the balance ws ploughed in May and&apos;sown with linseed. Prom the remaining 2i acres, a hay crop was taken; the land was immediately broke up and is now growing a promising crop of roots. The whole fi will be sown with corn next season.(2) An inspection was made of crops on newly broken grass land In Staffordshire and Shropshire. In the former county,! results of breaking up the.ordinary pastures and meadows In all districts were uniformly good. As a rule-the oat crops on nei broken grass could be distinguished by &quot;their vigorous growth fi , oats on old arable land, which were suffering from drought, wheat looked well throughout,the county.... In Shropshire the ei on newly broken turf as: a rule were excellent;unsatisfactory crops were relatively few in number and no more than would be found on a similar acreage of old arable land.(3)      Crops of rye and oats on newly broken grass land on Home Farm of Mr.. J.P., Mason, M.P., in Oxfordshire, were found I very promising.,     &quot;(4)      Several of the so-called &quot;moors&quot; In Cornwall and Dev have been inspected, and suggestions made as to the action whi might be taken by the Executive Committees with a view to the! .- improvement.
121Seed Testing (Station.  A visit has been made by the Chief Seed Analyst to the Seed Testing Stations of the Scotch and Irish Agricultural Departments/ and a report submitted on their equipment and personnel, with brief notes on the methods of working adopted.Wireworm Investigations *   These are being continued in two directions.    A large number of field observations are being made to discover the mode of life of the wireworm in the soil, the conditions favourable or unfavourable for its development. A series of chemical substances is being prepared and their toxic effect on the wireworm tested for the purpose of discovering a satisfactory soil inseotieide.Plant Poisons in new Fertilisers.    Certain new fertilisers. -blast furnace flue dust, waste nitrate, etc., - are very Impure and an investigation has been undertaken into the effect of the impurities on plant growth.    It will shortly be possible to prescribe limits beyond which certain impurities could not safely be allowed. .,. LABOUR DIVISION.m^tftnvm mm*uwwjimi m in i m mnMrt - &quot;new rmtu *Harvest Labour.   673 men have now been released from Command Depots on a monthfs agricultural furlough for harvest work.    The number of men available from these depots has proved disappointing and the War Office are accordingly making arrangements to extend the scheme.    This extension will result, it Is expected, in many hundreds of additional men becoming available.A large number of War Agricultural Volunteers and women are available for harvest or permanent work, and Committees have been instructed to bring this to the notice of all farmers, as it la important that this labour should be plaoed with as little delay as possible.Soldier Labour.    The number of soldiers now out on farms is 59,278.Prisoners of War.   17 additional prisoner camps have been opened during&apos; the week, making the, total number of prisoners- 5 -
now employed on farm or drainage work as followsProm 277 agricultural camps.................... 16,140Employed from other camps......................   1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farms............      360Released aliens employed In agriculture........   2.192Total................IJCTffl72 other schemes provided for the employment of afurther 4,450 prisoners in agriculture are under consideration Ithe War Office.War Agricultural Volunteers.   The number of War Agricultural Volunteers reported to the Department as having been placed to date is 859.     Several thousand other men are, however, availabl at employment exchanges and are being offered to employers in need of labour.     It Is, therefore, expected that the number of volunteers actually placed will show a large increase during the next two weeks.WOMEN&apos;S BRANCH.Training and Employment.   Competitions have recently been held among women who have been taught thatching in Cornwall and Devon and satisfactory reports have been received.All the training centres are at present full.    At Flookburgh&apos; in Lancashire, Messrs. Vickers have kindly offered hu completely furnished with a canteen, etc., to accommodate from 48 to 96 women, the cost to be at the rate of 2/- per week per hi The huts may be taken for a week or any longer period, and as a big demand for harvest labour is anticipated in this district the offer has been accepted, and women who have finished their training will be placed thert while awaiting work.14,355 women are accounted for in the Land Army as foilOn Farm Work............................ 10,46$Lent to Forage Dept........................ 181&quot;      &quot; Timber Supplies Dept............... 203In Instruction Centres..................... 2,701Waiting for references to be placed inTraining Centres....................... 37SWaiting in Depots.......................... 212Waiting in their own homes................. 227Total.............. 14,355A hostel has been opened at Market Bosworth, Leicester

Steam Taokle. The acreage dealt with during the past week Is as follows: - -ploughed 1,844 acres, cultivated 38,295 acres, harrowed 730 acres, mole drained 223 acres, rolled 219 acres. Total 41,312 acres. Arrangements for 1918 Harvest. &apos; 47 hinders were consigned durln the week ended 20th July, making a total of 3,995 consigned to date. 133 combined mowers and reapers have also been consigned 26 threshing machines were consigned during the week, making a total of 243 to date.An agreement has been reached with the Forage Committe which provides for the release of 150 engines for threshing froi the 15th August, together with at least 150 drivers.    These engines will be returned to the contractors from whom they have been hired by the Forage Committee, and will be of great assistance In threshing the 1918 harvest.    The Department on their side have agreed to release to the Forage Committee all Sauhderson tractors to be completed under their contract,(to the number of about 190) and also to supply a skilled driver for each tractor thus released.,.   SUPPLIES DIVISION. Sulphate of Ammonia.   Owing to the release by the Minister of Munitions, of a further quantity of sulphate of ammonia, the pre of meeting agricultural demands Is now more favourable.    The total applications for delivery received in the three months end 31st August amounted to 36,000 tons for England and Wales. Of this amount it has been possible to allocate 30,000 tons, of which 10,000 tons have been allotted to makers of compound manures.    All applications by &quot;Approved Agents&quot; for quantities under 10 tons have been granted and allocations have been madeU respect of 75$ of the-total amount applied for in the case of larger quantities.- 8 -
An interesting feature is the Increased demand which has arisen from Hales where formerly sulphate of ammonia was only sold in insignificant quantities.Approved Agents - Approved Agents have now been appointed in 34 counties;   the names in all cases have been submitted to Agricultural Executive Committees who have been asked to make local enquiries as to the suitability of the firms applying. Lime -   Up to the present time, the main difficulty In maintaining the output of lime has been the shortage of labour, but complaints have been received recently of difficulty in obtaining coal for burning and the Coal Controller has now informed the Department that owing to the decrease in the output and the demand for war purposes, no additional supplies can be allotted to this industry.     It is probable, therefore, that -considerable difficulty will be experienced in obtaining sufficient coal to meet current demands.     In view of this It will be necessary to urge makers to grind limestone or chalk. This however, is not always practicable as new machinery would be required.Potash - A scheme is under consideration to provide for the allocation of supplies of blast furnace flue dust between England, Scotland, and Ireland.    Up to the present time the distribution of supplies has been unsatisfactory, it being left to certain licensed agents to obtain supplies from blast furnace owners, the only restriction imposed upon them being that they sold to licensed dealers -at agreed prices.     It is now proposed to establish a control efficient enough to enable a proper distribution of supplies to be made between the three countries. Potato Spraying - No new areas have been found to be affected by potato blight during the last week.    One additional case was reported from Anglesey.    The continued wet weather throughout- 9 -
the week has interfered very seriously with demonstrations);; and also with the carrying out of actual spraying all over country.Seeds.   Returns have now been obtained from the principalseedsmen in England and Wales, as to the stocks and prospecsupplies of root and garden seeds.     The actual out-turn deon the weather during the next month or two, seed growing lBexposed to considerably greater risks than is the case withcrops.     It is estimated that the area of root seeds contrafor and awaiting harvest is fully up to the normal and verjconsiderably greater than the area harvested In 1917,    Thefigures as shown by the returns are as followsArea harvested       Area now stand! in 1917, for harvests1918.Mangold 1,750 acres 4^478 ac:Swede   - 1,855     &quot; .4,160Turnip 1,345     &quot; 3,280These figures promise a satisfactory yield of root seed for!1919 harvest.    This is particularly Important as the stockcarried over this year are less than half those held In 191Turnip is now being cut and the yield will be excellent propthat the present spell of wet weather breaks before the see!commences to shoot In the pod.The position as regards garden seeds seems generalsatisfactory, though In the case of certain seeds the mainsupply is derived from abroad.     It is at present too soonsay what kind of a crop may be expected this season.     Asatisfactory feature of the returns in respect of garden stfis that the amount carried over in 1918 is generally largerthan in 1917, particularly In the case of those seeds whiobwere obtained from overseas, auch as cauliflower, carrotonion.- 10 -
In the case of clover and grass seeds, the stocks on hand compare very favourably with last yearrs totals, but the adequacy of supply for the forthcoming season depends almost entirely on the crops which will be harvested this year In the United Kingdom.    these crops are not grown under contract, and no detailed Information is available as to the probable supply, though it is stated by the trade that the outlook is most satisfactory.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, Deputy Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.,President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
