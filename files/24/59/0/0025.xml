The following is a brief statement on the work of the department? during the past week in furtherance of increased Food education in Ireland:-

COMPULSORY TILLAGE - LAND INSPECTION.

The inspection of holdings for the purposes of the Tillage orders is proceeding. Lands set for cultivation on holdings entered by the Department, in consequence of the occupier&apos;s default in complying with these Orders have been satisfactorily cropped.

Provisional Regulations have been made by the Department under the Third Schedule of the Corn Production Act, 1917;

(1) prescribing the manner in which an occupier of a holding who in any year fails to cultivate the minimum tillage portion of the holding shall be afforded an opportunity of being heard;

(2) prescribing the time within which, and manner in which an occupier of a holding to whom a draft certificate is sent by the Department under Article 4. of the Schedule may serve a notice of objection to the draft certificate, and

(3) designating or constituting the Tribunal to which any questions raised by a notice of objection to a draft certificate, as to the making of the certificate or as to the particulars specified in the draft, shall be referred and providing for the hearing and determination by the Tribunal of the questions so referred to thorn, and generally for regulating the procedure of any such objection.

In connection with a claim for compensation made to the defence of the Realm and War Losses Commission by an occupier of lands for loss sustained in cultivating land in Ireland as required by the Tillage Regulations, the Commission have held that such claims cannot be recognised as these Regulations are of general application.
