IB Jopnman is the brcebbty oy his brii/bmic igjmrrs owHwigT)310?femo, by Mr. ?     Pratt .M,P. (Circulate with reference to War Cabinet 460 A.)I have taken pains to get into touch with most of the Scottish members with regard to the proposal8 for Re-afforeata-tion.(l)       The majority of members are quite strongly in favour of a separate authority for Scotland though in many cases the reason for this attitude is m*re political than practical.(2)       Regarding the constitution of the Scottish Authority there is a sharp divergence of opinion.    It is held by some that as the question of Small Holdings is so closely involved with that of Re-afforestation; the Scottish Board of Agriculture should continue to be the authority.   On the other hand a considerable number of Scottish Radical members are distrustful of the Board of Agriculture.   These members and others also express themselves adverse to the taking over of the forestry functions by the Development Commission.(3)       A nuoJ&amp;srof Scottish members are more inclined than formerly to regard the whole matter from the point of view of Imperial necessity and would, without doubt, support a Central Authority for the &quot;United Kingdom provided that Scotland was strongly represented on the Central body which would decide policy, and that the work of administration in Scotland was placed in the hands of a purely Scottish body.(4)       Given a Liberal financial policy and the certainty of trees being planted without delay, the great body of Scottish members would, I believe, be trilling for reasonable compromise in regard to the matters dealt with above.(sd) PRATT..
