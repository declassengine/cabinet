NOTE BY THE SECRETARY.

The attached Notes were originally prepared before the last Conference at Versailles to assist the Prime Minister in case M. Clemenceau or General Foch again raised the question of our man-power. I think they are of sufficient interest to be worth circulating.

&apos; .97&quot;2. THE MERCHANT SERVICE,(a) TONNAGE ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY GREAT BRITAINTO FRANCE.Taken in the aggregate and including vessels of over 500 tons gross as the basis of comparison, the British Mercantile Marine is 8 times as large as that of Prance, the figures beong*-.xGreat Britain 4,100 prance 500In round figures, the number cf British ships in the service Of France as at April 3Qth was 45Q with a gross tonnage of ,1,000,000,*The total amount of British tonnage in Allied service (in-cluding France) was 65Q ships with a gross tonnage of  2.000,000*The total net amount cf tonnage available for British Importing work (after deducting tonnage reserved for the Allies and the Colonies and tonnage engaged on British Naval and Military Service ) is approximately 1,500 ships, with a total gross tonnage of about 6,750,000.It must be remembered, however, that the above figures quite fail to represent the measure of the tonnage assistance whioh is beinr1; givin by this country tc France.   In addition to the vessels referred to above as being in the service of France, account must be taken of the services rendered to France by other vessels which, though remaining under British control, render incidental services to France, and it is estimated that this frnc-tion may be reckoned as equivalent to employment of an additional 250,000 tons of British shipping.The extent of this assistance rendered by us to France may be seen from the fact that British ships are now carrying close upon one-half of her total supplies of imported coal, and over 60% of her total importation of cereals:   in addition we are carrying large quantities of steel, railway cars and other material, barbed wire and other munitions of war.Ho less than 251 merchant ships are engaged in transporting and supplying the British Army in France, this being a service peculiar to an overseas army, which, of course, France does not need.This figure induces Troop and Remount ships, store ships. Frozen meat ships, Hospital ships, and the local cross Channel service,(b)   MAH-POT^ER INVOLVED IN TOMAGE.As regards Man-Power, the allocation of the 450 British steamers to French service involves not merely the total number of the crews cf all these 45Q steamers, but also the far greater number of men who make it possible to maintain these vessels in the service.   There are the various branches cf the steamship companies, the directors, the managers, the clerks, superintendents on the wharves, shore gangs on board the vessels in pert, dockers, truckmen, weighmen, tally clerks, lightermen, the railwaymen : all these contribute their quota of man-power effort towards maintaining those 450, vessels in the service of the French.Then again there is the man-power involved in the provision of supplies to the steamers.   Every Merchant Ship is divided into 3 Departments - Beck, Engine, and Stewards.   Each Department requires supplies, whether of rope or oil *r food, and the furnish-ing *f each of these commodities has its equivalent in Man-Power.
0 Qd 03 -No figures could &quot;be given in respect of the number of men engaged in providing these supplies, because, obviously, no line could be drawn which would define the particular share Of the day1s work in supplying a particular ship.   It would be impossible, for instance, to say how much rope made on a particular day by a rape-maker in Stepney, ultimately finds its way to the rigging of a vessel allocated by the Shipping Controller to French service.   But, if so many hours a day &quot;be reckoned as the equivalent of one man, it is manifest that, in tho aggregate, there must be in this country a large number of men permanently oocupied in equipping those ships that are employed for French account.3.    STEEL   OUTPUT.In the twelve months ending if ay 1st, 1918, Prance produced 2,175,000 tons ef steel (ingot weight).     Great Britain supplied to France 710,000   tons of semi-manufactured steel (-of which 353, QQQ tons was sho.ll steel) which is equi-vaicnt to 950, Qo&apos;6 tons of ingots.   In addition we supplied some 75,000 tons of iron goods and 492,000 tons of pig iron,Producting of steel ingots in Great Britain totalled 9,705, OOP tons.   (See Appendix 2).The ingot equivalent of the steel received by prance from the U.S.A, exceeded \\ million tons.312,OOP men and 31,OOP women were employed by the Steel and Iron trades in Great Britain in January 1918.     Nothing is known about the numbers employed in Franco.4.
