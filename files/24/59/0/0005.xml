Jtolitioal intelligence Department,^^7?7^V        * FOREIGN OMCE.&apos; &apos;:,v&quot;&apos;Germany /010,: MEMORANDUM&apos;  &apos;S onIPHE RDASQNS FOR KIJESIMAN1\TTS KESIGHAJIOfl. $he following is an article whioh was received from Germany but re-* fused publication by the pro-German papers of Zurich.1.     As we all know, for the first time during this war the party of the Geman Government Socialists refused to vote the credits demanded by the Government.    It is easy to see why they acted thus:   the Government Socialists have bean foroed by the growing discontent among the population due to shortage of food:   the unsucoess of tho army:   and the defeat of the Austrlans at the Have: &apos; to sacrifice something of their prestige to calm the feelings of their partisans.2.     It is, however, interesting to note the negative side of the question, for, after all, what active step has Soheidemann taken in view of the eomplainjbs of the members of his Party?    He neitherrthreatened a revolution nor proposed a general strike such as is to be seen everywhere to-day even in neutral countries with democratic Governments.    All fee aid was to threaten to refuse the credit       . a perfectly meanlngLess act. whioh has been tried often before 1914 and never had more than a theoretic value.    Not even the bitter complaints of the German Socialists against the threatening famine and the tyranny of the military despotism can move Soheidemann*s party to more than a theatrical ge sture.    His last act ie*y however, symptomatic in spite of himself.    His attitude in the Reichstag proves that the leaders of the Sozialdemokrats are at present more afraid of the disoontent in their own camp than of the attacks of the Government.
By r ef uslng...tJae ^r^ta,;&quot;t]ir^EM\N dozlaadmtoartie&apos; returns to its former position as an &quot;ensmv of the State&quot;: it losesall civil rights and &quot;becomes once more an outlaw.For SCHEIDEMANN and his companions to have taken such a risk upon themselves, the bitterness in their own camp must already hava been very great;    There are many other signs of this discontent amongst the GEHMAN people0Fj&amp;Ig-thinking Deputies such as lViULLKi^M^IwINGEN, who has done nothing since 1914 but publish lengthy volumes on &quot;The World Policy before the War&quot;, in which ho denies sverything ha qv$t said and proves the innocence of the German Government ^ have lately spoken in the Reichstag in tones that remind Qpa strongly of the debates that took place before the war,,, on German militarism at a time when the German &quot;Progressives&quot; did not deny things which are perfectly clear to all.    Since then, their acts have proved that they spoke but to speak, and that these so-called flFree-thinlcing&quot; Politicians are the most violent in time of war.    There..are, however, attenuating cir- umstanaes.     he German Government System is so firmly established that it would require superhuman strength to cause its downfall:  the individual is powerless0    No doubt the German people has no desire for intellectual freedom, but5 even if it had., it would be more difficult to change the form of government than is mostly supposed abroad.    It must be remembered that a Revolution can succeed only if the army backs it up.    ftid German army is? owing to the unity of interests existing between tho officers and the Government,, entirely in the hands of the Crown.    With this weapon every form Of resistance can be broken.    Trie last strike in Germany is an example of this.    So soon as tho soldiers were brought on to tho
scene, all was lost.    No^otic Rtirrod when the strlldnc? factories were put under martial law, nor when the leaders Of the strike were sent to the front, where they are still, branded with the sign,   BB18fl   (Berlin 1918) which ensures them particularly bad treatment wherever they go,    As sooir as the Array commands, the German is quiet, and he is ri$at, for the Army is too strong.No workman in Germany will risk another strikev which will result only in his being taken from the luun^tlon Pac-tory where ho is earning a good living to be sent to the front to certain death.    The Army itself will never revolt until it has been thoroughly beaten.    The Government, therefore, feels so secure that it has made concessions, not to the Left but to the i-an-German j^i.gilt.Kuehlraahn had to 30 so as to dispel all doubts as to the solidarity of the Government with the PaivGcrmans. 7 In itself this change is of no importance.   In Germanyit is never the marionettes on the front of the stage who rule, whether their name be Kuhlmann or Hintze, V) iQ may conclude that the discontent, on the Left hasgrown, and the Government, desirous cf covering Itself Bosichow, has decided to be reconciled with the sulky Conservative and Pan-German 1 arty0 9 The Chancellor remained because his presence  neuredthe adherence of the Centre, which has, according to the last speeches of its leaders, gone over entirely to the Pan-Germane.10        The German Government is having or eater difficulties with its Allies.    It is more difficult to calm their discontent,11        In Bulgaria the opposition is growing.   Austria is struggling against the Customs Union:   and Himpjary is
-118rebelling openly.The German Government uses every means to influence public opinion.    The Hungarian napers of the Opposition had a private telegraphic&quot; service in Switzerland, which of course gave a different view of the feelings of the enemies from that which suited the German Government. This is now to be  topped.   The German, Government has succeeded in buying the services of a Hungarian Journalist (supposed to belong to the Opposition) and this man is to found an official German-Hungarian information bureau in Switzerland,    If this plan succeeds, the independent Hungarian Bureau would be entirely submerged by the lies spread by the other.    So1 far official Hungarian Circles show little inclination to carry out this plan, but they will no doubt be obliged to obey fimlly.
