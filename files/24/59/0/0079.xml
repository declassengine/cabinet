Circulated by the Secretary of State for India,h^. ^_  CXhiS/Documenl is the propc?iy ofllix Brilaun%c Majesty&apos;s Government.fI undertook to circulate to the Cabinet a Memorandum setting forth, so - far as possible on the materials available, the nature of the reception the Report on Indian Reforms has had in India.   The following notes are based partly on information received from the Viceroy and partly on telegrams that have appeared in the Press.E. S. M&quot;.31st July 1918,290Views of Heads of Provinces.The Viceroy has reported that Lord Ronaldsftay, Governor of Bengal, and Sir Benjamin Robertson, Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, are both favourable to the scheme. Sir Harcourt Butler, Lieutenant-Governor of the United Provinces, and Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer, Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, have each stated that .they can work the scheme in their respective Provinces. Lord VVillingdon, Governor of Bombay, telegraphing on 25th July, states that he is quite satisfied with the way &quot; things are going on with the report.&quot;Views of Chiefs.I have received appreciative telegrams from the Maharaja of Bikaner, the Maharaja Scindia of Gwalior, and the Maharaja-Jam Saheb of Nawanagar. The Maharaja of Patiala has expressed himself publicly in this country in favour of that portion of the Report affecting Native States, and has welcomed the proposals generally.The Press and Indian Politicians.In Madras, where the Home Rule agitation has its stronghold, the organs of the advanced Indian party are hostile, namely, the Hindu, New India (Mrs. Besant), the Indian Patriot, and the Swadesa Mitram (the leading Tamil organ), edited by one of Mrs. Besant&apos;s friends. Justice (the non-Brahmin paper, edited by Dr. Nair) deplores the refusal to grant communal representation. The Madras Mail (the chief European paper) regards the changes in the Government of India as unnecessary and emphasises the principle that the central body ought not to be cast into a state of flux during the changes in the Provinces. It urges the European community to demand representation as a community.In Bombay, the Bombay Chronicle (edited by Mr. Horniman who has long championed the Home Rule cause) and certain Indian papers, including Tilak&apos;s organ, the Kesari, are hostile to the proposals. Like the extremists in Madras, extreme opinion in Bombay continues to press for the Joint Congress and Moslem League scheme which is criticised and rejected in the Report. It has to be remembered that Mrs. Besant and&apos; her friends practi-cally undertook to secure the acceptance of that scheme and to maintain their credit they are obliged to adopt a hostile attitude to everything else.The Times of India (Sir Stanley Reed) welcomes the scheme and appeals for fair and sober discussion. Of Indian-owned papers, the Advocate of India and Daily Gazette (Karachi) are also favourable, while the Indian Social Reformer does not believe that responsible Indian opinion will, when it realises the full significance of the proposals, countenance the imcompro-mising attitude of hostility towards them which is now adopted by some sections of opinion.Lord Willingclon informs me that the reports in the Press do not indicate the true state of public opinion in Bombay, and this view is confirmed by the Viceroy who reports that &quot; private advice from Bomboy &quot; records great and solid satisfaction with the tone and substance of the &quot; Report.&quot;In Calcutta the European papers adopted a critical tone at the outset, though the Statesman admitted that the scheme for increasing the responsi-bilities of the Provincial Legislative Councils &quot; is possibly as good as can be devised &quot; ; but it criticised it as placing almost impossible obligations on the Governor personally and likely to lead to friction.   The EnglishmanSS 636-1   45  7/18
2regretted that inadequate provision had been made for European representa-tion, and laid stress on the need for defining the electorate as a preliminary to further discussion. But telegraphing on 27th July the Viceroy stated that the attitude of the English papers had become distinctly more favourable. The proposals have received an important measure of support from moderate Indian politicians in Bengal. Mr. Surendranath Banerjee and his paper, the Bengali, have adopted a favourable tone towards the Report, and I gather from a telegram dated 14th July that appeared in The Times, that at a meeting of prominent leaders in Bengal, including Mr. Banerjee, Sir K. G. Gupta, Mr. B. C. Mitter, and Sir Rajendra Mukerjce, the scheme was warmly Avelcomed.In the United Provinces the Pioneer lias apparently adopted a favourable attitude on the whole, and this appears also to be the case with the Indian Daily Telegraph, of which the Raja of Mahmudabad is the proprietor. The Allahabad Leader, edited by Mr. Chintamani, which is regarded as the organ of Pandit Malaviya, is, from all I can gather, a warm friend of the proposals. The Viceroy states that the United Provinces have given a better reception to the Report than any other Province.As regards opinions of individuals other than those already referred to, Mr. Sastri, who succeeded Mr. Gokhale in his work on the &quot; Servants of India Society,&quot; has openly stated that the reforms deserve to be welcomed, and generally supported. Sir G. Chitnavis of the Central Provinces has welcomed the scheme as. a substantial first instalment, and has expressed the view that the proposals constitute a genuine attempt to put India on the path towards attaining a responsible Government within a reasonable period. Sir Fazulbhoy Karimbhoy has expressed his approval of the scheme, and a favourable attitude has also been adopted by certain other prominent members of the Bombay Legislative Council. Sir S. P. Sinha and Mr. Basu have expressed themselves in the English Press in support of the scheme.A special meeting of the Congress is to be held at Bombay in, August to consider the proposals. It is clear that the extremists are making great efforts to dominate the meeting. I see from a telegram dated 22nd July, in the Manchester Guardian, that they succeeded in achieving their aim at the meeting of the Bengal Provincial Conference on the 14th July, when the moderates were refused a hearing. It is, therefore, to be anticipated that the extremists will achieve the same result at Bombay. The best com-mentary on their actions is contained in the following extracts from a telegram I have received from the Viceroy :  &quot; The extremists captured the machinery of Congress last December at Calcutta ; the Bombay moderates have announced their intention of abstaining from August session, indicating they will not follow extremists ; Banerjee has established his Liberal League in Bengal, and a large body of moderate opinion in favour of scheme is growing more articulate (vide Chandavarkar&apos;s letter in the Statesman, and manifesto of Bombay moderates; see the Leader also). . . . The extremists are being isolated in an increasing degree, and the moderates are coming more boldly out in support of proposals. I hope and believe extremists will not sweep the board or carry public opinion with them, but being vocal and well organised they create an impression disproportionate to their influence, and, having command of Besant&apos;s and Tilak&apos;s funds, they are able, to pursue an active propaganda. ... I retain view that the Home Rulers and extremists are striving, by preserving an atmosphere of extreme hostility, to extort greater concessions, and their attitude is, in our opinion here, largely one of bluff. Because the most vocal and truculent they must not be regarded as the most influential section of the public which, as &apos; explained, is rallying in increased strength in support of the scheme.&quot;The proceedings at Bombay will not, therefore, be an indication of the attitude of Indian political opinion as a whole, and such information as I have supports the view stated in a telegram from the Manchester Guardian&apos;s special correspondent, dated 22nd July, that &quot; Moderate opinion steadily &quot; favours the general principles of the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms scheme &quot; standing apart from the Extremists who demand its entire rejection.&quot;
