Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 31st July, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland :-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

One hundred and two applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to ?, under the Scheme, amounts to £57,301.



PROGRESS OF CROPS.



The past week witnessed a great improvement in the condition of crops, particularly in the case of potatoes.   In the event of the present favourable weather continuing, and "blight" not spreading to any considerable extent, the yield of potatoes should greatly exceed expectations based on the conditions prevailing a few weeks ago. The Department&apos;s? Instructors report that spraying of potatoes to prevent ? attack of "blight" is being very extensively carried out in the greater part of the country, although, as heretofore, in some districts difficulties are experienced in inducing ? a certain type of ? to adopt this preventive measure.

The harvesting of corn crops has already begun in early districts and will be in active progress in a number of counties early in August.

FLAX.

Thirty-eight Temporary Inspectors and three Supervisors have been appointed in connection with the Flax Seed (Ireland) Order, ?. This completes? the list of Inspectors whom it was proposed to appoint.

Flax pulling has now commenced in the early districts and will be general? throughout all districts next week. Reports regarding the ? of home saved seed continue to be satisfactory and this leads ? to regard compulsory saving of seed more favourably. The Department regret to find that in some cases English seed has proved to ? of a "seed" and not a "fibre" variety, and farmers are threatening ? some cases to take legal proceedings against the vendors of the seed.

Considerable dissatisfaction has been expressed by growers regarding the award ? 1s. 1d. per hour or stock, or  £4. 5. 0. per acre. ? made under the provisions of a Proclamation applying the ? of War Acts to any disputes in connection with the employment of persons in Ireland engaged in the pulling, etc. of flax. Growers ? that unless matters are road justed they will discontinue the ? of flax.

Up to the present the Department have granted 67 permits covering ? sale of 238 acres of flax on foot. Over 40,000 copies of the

?/7/18.


Department&apos;s Special leaflet No.24 have been distributed to date. Two of the Department&apos;s Flax Instructors have resigned their appointments to take up positions as Mill Inspectors under the Flax Supplies Committee, Belfast, and the Department have under consideration the question of training a number of Flax Apprentices with a view to their qualifying for the position of Flax Instructor.

The area under flax in Ireland this year has been estimated at 130,000 acres, as compared with 108,000 acres last year, and the Department are taking steps to secure an increase in the acreage for 1919.

With a view to augmenting as much as possible the supply of flaxseed for sowing and feeding purposes, the Department are making arrangements to impress upon farmers the necessity for saving the maximum possible quantity of seed from their flax crop over and above the one-eighth prescribed in the Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918.

INSTRUCTION IN USE OF HARVESTING MACHINERY.

The series of demonstration lessons arranged for the Department&apos;s Agricultural staffs is now in progress and will continue during a period of four weeks. A preliminary course in the working of binders is being given to 48 assistant Instructors. This will be followed by a course in the working of petrol driven threshing sets, tractors, etc. at which 150 officers will attend, in batches of 15. The object of the demonstrations is to provide instructors with such knowledge as will enable them to assist inexperienced farmers in starting newly purchased machinery to work, and in adjusting of simple working defents.

ARTIFICIAL MANURES.

Certain quantities of Basic Slag and Sulphate of Ammonia are now being imported into Ireland under the arrangements made in conjunction with the Food Production Department, London, for the distribution of available quantities of these fertilisers. The Fertilisers Allocation Committee of the Department are at present engaged on a detailed scheme for the equitable allocation of Sulphate of Ammonia among distributing merchants. It is expected that the available supplies of this fertiliser will be considerably short of requirements.

CATTLE FEEDING STUFFS.

Negotiations are proceeding with the Ministry of Food with a view to reaching? a satisfactory arrangement whereby a definite proportion of available supplies of feeding stuffs will be allocated to Ireland. The continued shortage of these foods has interfered to a very ? extent with the cattle and pig industries in Ireland.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK

During the period from 22nd to 29th instant, inclusive, 287 applications for licences to slaughter or export animals under the Order relating to breeding ? were received, and 276 licences were issued. During the same period 124 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers and 25 applications for licences to export store heifers worn received. Twenty-four applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks were also received.
