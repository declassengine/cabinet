&quot;uIHISfe .QJMIEALTH and LOCAL aoVl^Ml!!^. Functions of tho Local Government Board.Correspondence and Statement circulated by Sir. Hayes Fisher.KINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION,7ikDoar Hayes Fisher,2, ^uoen Annefs Gate Bdgs., Westminster, S,W. 3. 20th July, 1918,I should be grateful if you would send mo, as promised at to-day18 meeting of the Committee, tho statement giving tho powers and duties (a) which could be immediately transferred from tho Department, and (b) which could be transferred at a future   * date.Yours sincerely,(Sd)   CHRISTOPHER ADD130N.LOCAL C0VME2NT BOARD, Whitehall , S.W.3. 50th July, 1938.Dear Addison,In reply to your letter of yesterday1 b date, I enclose a statement in which I have endeavoured to set out in tabular form the functions at present exercise &amp; by the Local Government Board and to divide thorn as far as possible into functions directly or indirectly concerned with Public Health and functions not so concerned.As you know I hold tho view and hold it strongly that you cannot dissociate many of those functions from a Ministry of Hoalth and Local Government, and I have grave doubts.as to the advisability of transferring even those few which fall into Column B of the statement.   For example I feel that you stand to lose rather than to gain by transferring the insignificant powers which the&quot;Local Government Board possesses in such matters as Public Libraries, Museums or Fire Brigades to other Departments, if the sanctioning of loans in connexion with.1ihem &quot;remains with the Ministry of Health and Local Government.   It means more overlapping and more duplication of work.   In fact the more nearly you can approach to the ideal of having one central authority responsible for all Local Government services, apart from those which fall into distinct spheres of central government, e.g, education, agriculture, public order, the better in my view.I have purposely excluded Poor Law from the statement &amp;53-.as you excluded it in the &quot;Analysisw*you brought with you yester-day,   I assume you hold that so far as poor law is concerned we cannot go beyond the making of a statement on the lines agreed at the appropriate stage of the Bill.I can&apos;t pretend that the list, which has been prepared at short notice, is complete or, exhaustive, but I think it gives., a fair synopsis of the main functions of tho Local Government Board.Yours very truly,(Sd)   W. II. FISHER.
