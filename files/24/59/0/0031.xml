f^tHal..THffi^PBKSTARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES, THE PRESIDENT OF THEThis Document is the Property ofJ0$-c?a&apos;/y^wmm op the working classes after the war.Ui -I -iV        ^Jf Memorandum byLOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD and THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRIOITLTURE AND HSHERIBS,and &apos;LETTERS FROM THE CHANCELLOR OF&quot; THE SPCCHEQtOKB AND- THE WBffiMX FOR SCOTLAND.Is Britannic Majesty&apos;^ Gt^nmenttil   /-r/u i&apos; ronertv of    /   //z131The subject of the Housing of the Working Glasses, during the transition period after tho War, was last \*efore the War Cabinet on the 12th March last when it was agreed that the Local Government Boards for England and Scotland should issue the Circular then before the Cabinet to the Looal Authorities in the form agreed by the Cabinet.It wa3 stated in the Minutes of the War Cabinet Meeting that it was gonerally agreed that the force of some of the main criticisms made during the discussion would best be tested by the issue of the Ciroular.The Circular was issued on the 18th March last to 1806 local authorities.   Sinoe that time the various local authorities have been calculating how tho Government scheme is likely to affect them, and from letters received asking for further information, applications in regard to sites, and so forth, we have casually obtained information that at least 225 looal authorities are ready to go on with sohemes with the Government assistance aotually offered.For convenience of reference the Government terms as stated in the Circular of 18th Maroh last are set out in an Appendix to this Memorandum.There have, however, as was to be anticipated, been attempts to obtain more favourable terms from the Government and these have been assisted by rumours which have been spread that under pressure better terms could be obtained.Thus, a conference, held at Manchester, of County Boroughs in Yorkshire and Lancashire proposed that the loss whioh looal authorities should be called upon to bear should be limited to 25$ of the actual loss during the first 7 years not exceeding in any case the produce of a rate of Id. in the  *, the Treasury to bear any loss occurring after the expiration of the 7 years.The Municipal Corporations Association subseoriently considered the terms offered by the Government and the termB proposed by the Manchester Conference.   They rejected the latter but proposed that the less to be made good by the local authority should not exceed the produce of a rate of Id. in the  . at any time and asked for oertain minor amendments in the terms proposed by the Government.This decision was communicated to the Local Govern-ment Board on the 2nd instant.P.T.O.
The proposal that the contribution of the local authority towards the deficit should never, even in the oaae of the larger local authorities, exceed the produoe of a Id. rate, we regard as inadvisable as striking at the very root of the principle of partnership between the State and local authorl-ties on which tho scheme reots.   If it were adopted it would mean that once the limit is reached, an authority could embitfk on a new and ambitious programme at the sole cost of the tax* payer.We consider that the Municipal Corporations Association represents the real strength of any opposition te the Government proposals, inasmuch as they are mainly representative of the larger local authorities who are least likely to benefit by the discretion vested in the Local Government Boards by the Government scheme to limit the deficit in respect of whioh Local Authorities aro to be responsible to the produce of a rate of id. in the  .Thlo bsing the case we think it may pe stated with some oonfidenoe that if, after consideration, the War Cabinet are prepared to allow a statement to be made on their authority that the Government are not willing to modify their proposals in this respeot the local authorities will for the most part accept the situation and the Government offer.We must, however, point out that the Housing Bill whlcji was before the War Cabinet on the 12th March l&amp;Bt, and was referred to a Committee under tho Chairmanship of Mr. Walter Long for consideration, is an integral part of our Rousing policy, inasmuch as it provides for aubgtituting Couniy Councils for the minor authorities where the letter have not taken adequate steps tc provide any necessary houses and also facilitates the provision of houses by County Councils for persona of the working olaaB employed or paid by them.The Committee reported in favour of the Bill and wetfrink it of vital importance that the Bill should be introduced and passed into law at the earliest pooeible moment.We hope that the War Cabinet will agree to allow the suggested statement to be made with their authority and will consent to the introduction of the Housing Bill at an early date.1ST.

TREASURY CHAMBERS,

Whitehall, S.W.

My dear Hayes Fisher,

I have considered the draft Memorandum which you sent to me with reference to the Housing of the Working Classes after the War, and I quite agree that a public statement should be made of the Government policy with regard to this matter in the sense suggested in the Memorandum.



Yours sincerely,

SCOTTISH OFFICE,

Whitehall, S.W.1.

19th July, 1918.



My dear Hayes Fisher,

I have considered the draft memorandum enclosed With your letter of 16th instant, which you propose to submit to the War Cabinet jointly with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the subject of Housing.

I cannot, of course, in terms associate myself with the references to English statistics and to the Housing Bill, which, so far, is not designed to apply to Scotland. But I see advantages in the issue of a statement confirmatory of the Government policy as already announced, and am therefore prepared to concur in the suggestion that the War Cabinet should authorise a statement to be made that the Government are not prepared to modify their proposals, as communicated to Local Authorities in March last, with regard to the financial aid to be given to Local Authority housing schemes after the war.



Yours sincerely,

(Sgd.) ROBERT MUNRO.


APPENDIX.The Treasury have laid down the following principles, namely:-;&apos;V\&apos;*     ^Tbe full cost of the scheme should, in the firet instant be,,J$t out of the funds of the Local Authority by means of a loan to be raised by them and for a period of years, whioh my Lords think- should not be less than Devon, the necessary State aeslstanoi shoulii be given in the form of a grant of a percentage of the loan oharg^e sufficient to relieve the authority ef 75 per cent, of thi estimated annual defioi-j   the deficit in eaoh case should ba estimated, with due regard to the actual inorease in the ooat of construction in the particular locality, on the basis of the estimated annual expenditure and the estimated annual income over, a period of years;   the interest charge on loan moneys should be taken at the amount actually paid where loans are raised from an outside souroe specifically for the purpose, or at the ourrent market rate where the money is provided from accumulated funds in tfce hands of the Looal Authority.  At the end of the period above referred to the property should be valued, and 75 per oent. of the exoeas (if any) of the amount of the loan outstanding; over the then value of the property should be met by the State, either by writing off a portion of the outstanding liability (if the money was borrowed from State sources), or by the Government undertaking responsibility for the appropriate proportion of the loan ohargee fox the remainder of its currency.Any loans by the State for the purpose of assisted schemes would be made at the full market rate of interest current from time to time, and not at the preferential rates ordinarily allowed for housing loans, in order (l) that the whole of the State assistance may be given under one head, and (3) that Looal Authorities may be encouraged to borrow on their own credit rathe? than to have reoourse to State capital funds.*Mr. Fisher has always taken the view that la this te&amp;tter there must be a partnership between the State and the Looal Authorities, and he was not disposed to contend that as regards most Looal Authorities the extent of the assistance which the Treasury proposed to fcive in accordance with the above principle was inadequate generally,   He felt, however, that oases might arise, espeoially in agricultural areas, in whioh tha sharing by Local Authorities in the contemplated dafioit, even to the extent of 35 per cent., might prove a somewhat heavy burden.  He accordingly represented to the Treasury that in these oases he should be empowered to allow a further proportion of the burden to be plaoed on the Btate, and made oertain suggestions with this object.  He is glad to be able to state that he h*&amp; been sympathetically met by the Treasury in this matter.   They have not stated as follows:-&quot;My Lorda are willing to agree that the Board should hava discretion, in cases in whioh 35 per cent, of the deficit in respeot of any scheme would exceed the produce of a rate of a penny in the  . on the area ohargeable, to inorease the gtfant beyond 75 per cent., subject to the condition that the amount of the deficit to be boms by the Looal Authority shall not be reduced bolow the produce of a rate of a penny in tha  .f
