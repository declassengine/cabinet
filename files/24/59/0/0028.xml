In addition, one Norwegian vessel of 1,307 tons already employed in the service of the Allies, was transferred to the British flag. 4. STANDARD SHIPS *Since the last report the standard ships de-livered have only numbered two, namely, the &quot;WAR LEOPARD&quot; of the &quot;B&quot; type, 8,000 tons deadweight, and the &quot;WAR SHELL&quot;, &quot;D&quot; type, 3,000 tons deadweight.    From the launohings that have taken place, however, it is evident that the stream of supply will be fairly constant in the near future.   The steamers at present on s-erv&apos;oe have been doing their woi^k well, and two of them have recently been appropriated for Liner Service.
117rSHIPS BUILDING ABROAD. 4tThe steel ships,Jjulldlng in/Vaiinou^er-4a^ considerably delayed owing to the fire which took place.   One steamer only has besn^elivered-during^jthA week, namely, the &quot;1?AR WIZARD&quot;, built at Ontaria.   The wooden steamers building both on the V/est Coast and the East Coast of Canada are progressing steadily.. The first of them, the &quot;WAR YUKON&quot; has just sailed for the United Kingdom.   Others are rapidly approaching completion, and it has been arranged that some of them should proceed to Australia, and there load sleepers for South. Africa^.After which they will load coala for Aden. FOREIGN TONNAGE.&apos;0ne Norwegian steamer the &quot;GRORUD&quot; has been requisitioned during the week.   There are no losses to report.The repatriation of the majority of the crews from the Dutch veasele requisitioned by His Majestyfa
1185.Government, has now been accomplished.Some of the crews of the requisitioned Russian steamers who were not sent back at once are still in this country awaiting repatriation, this cannot be arranged at present owing to the conditions existing in Russia.Arrangements are being made to requisition a 10,000 ton deadweight steadier built by the Lloyd Royal Beige at whiteinch. WEST AFRICAN COAST.The increased use of the ports on this coaBt from Gambia to the Cameroons for the export of ore, palm oil, kernels and ground nuts for the United Kingdom, has brought out prominently a lack of proper harbour and railway facilities for the handling of the large steamers which are now being loaded there.
119frft*6.(3)     COAL POSITION,..,The general coal position, so far as export is concerned, is becoming very serious and the matter is age in being taken up with the Coal Controller.    The programme to Italy is being covered only with the greatest difficulty. It would be quite impossible to cover the French programme, but the congestion at the French ports referred to previously not having been removed, the shortage of coal in this country does not for the moment, directly prejudice the French supplies v.Ag regards supplies under the general export programme to other destinations than France and *taly, e.g., Scandinavian Neutrals, South America, etc., the shortage is very serious. There is no lack of tonnage, it is the coal that is wanting.As illustration, the total amount of coal which should have been shipped for the first week of July to cover the ordinary minimum programmes was about 790,-000 tons, the actual shipments amounted to 504,000 tons only. S/s &quot;CARPATHIANThis vessel, which was engaged on American trooping, was sunk by enemy action whilst on outward voyage to the United States. %.-CDITiSRRANFAH TROOPING.There is nothing of special interest to report.   Several vessels have boon loaned, to the French
7,Government for the movement of French troops in the*Mediterranean. HOSPITAL SHIPS.In view of the sinking of the &quot;LLANDOVERY CASTLE&quot;, the question as to the-procedure to be adopted in connection with Hospital Ships on the Atlantic run to and from the United Kingdom is engaging the close attention of the War Staff of the Admiralty.   In the meantime the hospital ship service on this run has been temporarily discontinued. CROSS CHANNEL TROOPING.,The first of the Cross Channel Transports, which are being provided by the United States of America, has arrived at Southampton, and three others are shortly expected.STORES FOR THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE.For the week ending 13th July, 163,779 ton3 of military stores were discharged in France. REPATRIATION OF UNFIT PORTUGUESE.The repatriation in British tonnage of 6,000
8.Unfit Portuguese from Brest to   Lisbon is at present under discussion and it will probably bo necessary to utilise one of the Cross Channel Transports for the purpose.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd) John Anderson.
