Similar representations were made at the Conference of ,^omenrs County Agricultural Committees in June when the Chairman of the Board promised that the matter would be given favourable consideration In the Department.    It is understood /
understood that the need for Buch training has been insufficiently met by the existing scheme for training women on farms owned by private individuals and the Ministry of Labour have informed the Board that they have on their registers a large number of women ready for training.     In these circumstances the Board have decided, in view of the necessity for providing training facilities without delay, to utilise their farm at Beechwood in Inverness as a training centre.    It is expected that about 20 women can be trained at any one time.    The Board of Trade (Timber Supply Department) have agreed to give at a nominal cost huts for the accommodation of the trainees.4lfl Insneotipn of Immune Varieties of Potatoes;-The inspectors appointed under this scheme are now sending in their reports and an examination of those received to date shows that such a scheme of inspection ia fully justified. The information given by the Inspectors is, according to instruot-i-ione issued by the Board, furnished under three main heads viz:-(1)   Is the crop true to type?(2)   Prevalence of &quot;Rogues&quot;.(3)   General condition of the crop.Under (2) the following detailed instructions have beengiven:-&quot;The letters A,B,C,D, should be used to indicate -*A&quot; Iree from rogues.*BW No  more than 1$ of rogues.HC&quot; Over if but not more than 5$ of rogues.MDM Over bf of rogues - In cases of this kind a special report on foolscap should be furnished.In the caae of &quot;C&quot; crops a eecond visit will be necessary to ensure that the &quot;rogues&quot; have been removed.    So far as &quot;Aw and nBn crops are concerned a recommendation for the issue of a certificate can be given straightaway.iH*BL.   If the percentage of rogues in a crop is greater than oft a certificate should not be recommended.    The ultimate destination of any certified crop may be an area infected with Wart Disease and the presence of more than 5^ of rogues even if the grower attempted to olear them out would render it unsafe for use in infected land.&quot;Of the crops that have been -examined to date and respecting which reports have been received about 5C$ are classed as &quot;A&quot;, about 40? as nB&quot;, and the remainder as KCW or &quot;Dtt.     In the caae of ,fB&quot; crops instructions have been given to the -rowerB to eliminate the rogue plants at once and if this is done satisfact-:orily certificates of purity trill bb issued in due course, A number of the &quot;C51 crops may also be certified if the growers have the necessavy labour and are willing to undertake thorough roguing but in no ca^e will a certificate be isbued in respect of a WD&quot; crop for the reasons given in the above extract from the Inspectors instructions.The /
The reports^, also show that in the districts visited the eenditlon of this year&apos;a potato crop is on the whole satisfactory, In some oasos crops have suffered &quot;badly from drought while others are affected with rust.    One or two cases of blight (Phytophthora Infestans) have been reported.    Evidence of short-f rage of labour is shown in the condition of one crop which is so badly overgrown with weeds that in the opinion of the Inspector satisfactory roguing cannot be effected. .St. BMW improvement ,gqtea^a&amp;LThe Board have at present under consideration appli-* oations for Rams under their Sheep Improvement Scheme for season 1918.Under this Scheme provision is wade for :- .X.    The hire of Hams of the Blackfaced, Cheviot, and Border ] Leicester Breeds from the Board and from neighbouring farmers by ; Crofters Common Gratings Committees or other duly constituted Committees in the Crofting Counties.II.    The sale of Border Leicester Rams by the Board to Committees in the Counties of Caithness and Orkney and Committees of Hew Settlements created with the assistance of the Board at half of the cost prioe of the rams.The Board1s rams are specially seleoted with a view to improving the sheep stocks in the various districts, and the Crofters * Committees are enabled to obtain the services of these 1 rams at a low rate of hire, viz., 10A per ram.It is gratifying to know that the Soheme is gaining popularity and that the sheep stocks in the Crofting Counties have steadily improved einoe its inauguration.The following statement shows the gradual increase.....inthe number of rams hired during the years 1914 to 1917; viz. -   * IX$a, *	Numbt supplied 1	3r of Bams ay the, $oard.

4015.regulations are considered by the men undertaking Forestry training to be inefficient for their maintenance at the present time.    The Board have been further informed by certain ovmer8 of woodlands that they would be willing to supplement the existing training allowances by the payment of a email weekly wage in virtue of the assistance given by the men in connection with their training.Ae the training regulations do not admit of euoh payments without the deduction of a relative amount from the men!e allow-tancee, the Board took up the natter with the Ministry of Pensions who have now intimated informally that men under training in forestry may receive a weekly wage in addition to the allowances under the Ministry of Pensions regulations.While the Board have no power to regulate the amount which may or should be paid to men undergoing the preliminary course of vix months1 training it has been suggested to them that a uniform rate of wage of 5A per week should be adopted on all estates in order to prevent the discontent and unreet which would probably arise if varying amounts were paid.   The Board have accordingly brought the matter to the notice of owners.
