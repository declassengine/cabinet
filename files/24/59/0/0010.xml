(c) Artillery. The training and equipping of artillery personnel is&quot;proceeding satisfactorily and the Divisional Artillery will as a rule he ready for the line as soonas, the Combat Divisions provided a sufficient supply of horses can &quot;be arranged.   The supply of horses appears to foe the limiting factor at present, hut is now improving and it is hoped, by the end of August that the greater proportion of the numbers required will be attained.There is one Brigade of Coast Artillery (Heavy) in the line with,9 types of guns and howitzers, and 7 Regiments of Coast Artillery training, 4 of which will have completed their training by the beginning of August. Three of these regiments will be equipped with British 8&quot; howitzers or 9,2&quot; howitzers and the remainder with the 155   m,m, French piece,   A few 8&quot; howitzers have been received from America but they require a great deal of overhauling before being fit for use and as workshop accommodation is very scanty, progress is slow,(d) Personnel.   In addition to a Staff College at LAHGRKS,&apos; &quot;there are at present three groups of schools in existence for the instruction of officers and other ranks in France, viz(a) Army Schools at Langres.(b) 1st Corps School at GONDREGOURT and(c) 2nd Corps School at CHAT I LLC-ft.The Army Schools include a School of Instruction for Officers in Infantry work - open and trench warfare, map reading, and the usual other subjects - a Candidates School for Commissions and Musketry, Lewis Gun, Bombing, Gas, Signalling and Engineer Schools,The Corps Schools have courses on tactics, musketry, Lewis Gun, bombing, gas and signalling.The standard of Students at these courses has much improved and is now fairly good, while the instruction 13 also better now, there being more practical work done and fewer lectures.At all the Schools (except the Candidates for Commissions School) there are British instructors.3*     OPERATIONS. During the past week, American troops have been engaged in the battle between Soissons and the Argonne, and for the first time a Corps consisting of 3 American Divisions and 1 Moroccan Division has been commanded by an American General (Eullard) and taken part as a tactical command in battle,   So&apos; far 7 American Divisions have taken part in the fighting and an eighth has probably by this time been also engaged!   In this fighting, it is claimed that over 6,000 prisoners, more than 3 00 guns and many&apos;machine guns and trench mortars have been taken by American troops.   Up to 10th July the total American casualties (Including died of disease but not Including slightly wounded) are given as 10,617 all ranks, while in the present battle the casualties of 3 Divisions are estimated to be about 7,000,General staff, War Office. 24/7/18.
