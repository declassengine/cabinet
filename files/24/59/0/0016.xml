Memo, &quot;by the Ri ht Hon.G.fi.Barno^^M.P.Mw-waMM^MiMw,^&apos; *****  i&quot; &apos;   ri** mi I &apos;i* &apos;**&apos;*******&apos;**^&apos;?&quot;T$Previous papers:- G.T.3598, 6,&amp;.3418, ft.3!.3818, ^T.3884, also T-te GaM.net 358, Minute 10 and War Cabinet 365, a/tin.14)1, On the 82nd February last the Far Cabinet approveda Regulation under which it was made an offenoe for a woman suffering from venereal disease in a oommunioahle form, to have sexual intercourse with any member of His Majesty^s Forces.    It the time when the matter was under discussion, it was pointed out that objection to the Regulation might be raised in Parliament on the ground that the penalties imposed applied only to wcmen and not to men.    Those xoars have oertainly been realised.    Ever since the Regulation came into foroe I have reoeived resolutions protesting against it, and pressure has recently boen brought to bear by the Executive Council of the Labour Party, the women members of which take the strongest possible objection to the Regulation.8* These objections are not based wholly on the groundthat the penalties imposed by the Regulation apply only to women; there is also a strong feeling that the existence of the Regulation aots as an encouragement to vice, by lessen--ing the risks attendant on promiscuous sensual indulgence. In addition to these objections in principle, there is the practical objection that the Regulation fails to achieve its purpose of checking the spread of venereal diseases.3. On the question of principle I am in sympathy withthose who objeot to the Regulation.    On the praotical question, I have made enquiries of various experts, and I find that the administration of the Regulation is beset with many difficulties.    In the first plaoe it is diffi--oult to tbtain adequate evidence; in the second plaoe there are grave difficulties in connection with the medioal examination; and in the third plaoe it is necessary that the greatest caution should be exercised to ensure that innocent persons are not arrested under the Regulation. I am satisfied, on the last point, that great care is eacer--oised by the polioe and the Home Office; at the same time,&apos; the effectiveness of the Regulation is necessarily impaired, as the police dare not take the risk of arresting any woman under the Regulation unless they know her to be a profession--al prostitute*4i With regard to the first two difficulties, returnsrecently obtained by the Home Office show that ifr more than half the oases reported to the polioe, sufficient evidence could not be obtained to go before a magistrate.     Since the Regulation came into operation, up to the 30th June, 163 oases have been reported to the police; and of these, in only 74 oases was there sufficient evidence to warrant proceedings being taken before a magistrate.      In these 74 oases, 44 persons were oonvicteel, 26 were acquitted, and 4 were pending at the date of the return.    Bvidenoe was&apos; Kiven in 52 cases by soldiers who had contracted disease.1P.T.0.
In view of the smallnesa of these nutrfbers, and alfl* of the faot that Clause 5 of the Orladaal Law Amendment Bill - whioh applies a similar restriction to the popul--ation generally - has been remitted to a Joint Committee of the two Houses, it seems to t&amp;e that the i&amp;r Cabinet should consider whether the effeotivenesB of Regulation 40 Do is sufficient to Justify its continuation until Parliament has dealt with Clause 5 of the Criminal Lara ^amendment Bill.     Opposition to the Regulation is very strong and will certainly grow stronger.    1 The l/omens Ca-Operative Guild is beginning to be very active in op--position to the Regulation, which I think might well bo suspended by administrative aotion on the part of the Home Office until the Joint Committee has reported on the general question.(Initialled)2, mttehall Gardens, 3. *?. 86th July 1918t
