(I).REPORT AS TO THE 3TATE OP IBBLAHP. by Lord French.The reports of tho Inspector General of the Royal Irish Con-atabulary and those of the Chief Commissioner of the Dublin Metro-politan Police give a very good outline of the state of the country during the months of May and Juno.The brain power of those organizations which are the ohief dis-turbing element in Ireland is mostly centred in the City of Dublin; and a comparison between the report of the Inspector General and tho Chief Commissioner will be a very fair guide as to the central aotiv^ ity and the effect throughout the country generally of their disloyal machinations and propaganda.At the beginning of May, while outwardly the country had an air. ; of great prosperity, under the surface the most dangerous organize^ tions were maturing thoir plans.    Consequently we took such actions as we thought essential to place the leaders in a position in which thoy could do no further harm, and whioh would enable us to establish a basis from which wo could lay the foundations of a policy which we thought v/ould ensure this malignant unrest being efficiently dealt with on the one hand; and on the other hand, to create a con-dition of confidence which would gradually grow among the great proportion of the oonanunity who wore terrorised into compliance with the directions of these pernicious movements.At first the results of this policy were slow in growth, but week by week we have found that the healthy action whioh we thought would follow this policy of firmness has become more and more apparent.The best barometer for indicating these results may bs taken from the indictable offences recorded during tho months of May and June.    In May these offences numbered S89t    In June thoy had sunk to 174, which would appear to warrant the belief that the policy initiated was on sound lines.Several areas in Ireland called for exceptionally severe treats mont owing to the attompted murder of police.    These areas were turned into Military zones.    Freedom of fairs and markets were pro* hibited, with the result that tho largo proportion of tho community whose interests are entirely centred on agricultural productions, are bringing pressuro to bear on the unruly youths of those aroas who wero the acti\re participants in the Sinn Fein and other msve-ments.    A more wholesome situation, therefore, is being created, as the Law is beginning to receive the assistance of all those whose livelihood is dopondent on the. produce of their farms, or the trade of their shops.These Secret Societies had eaten so deeply into the life of certain parts of the country that it would be most unwise to assume that tho Improvement, which at present is so noticeable, could be taken as a reason for any relaxation of the present policy for some time to come, as public confidence in a country constituted as Ireland is, is a very delicate plant.    Moral courage is not one of tho great attributes of the Irish people, but whatsis going to bo of material assistance during tho next few months in - what we hepe-perraanently removing the thoughts of the great majority of the people from these unhealthy and rebellious ideas, will be the pros-peots of an excellent harvests** &amp; -
-01 JTho pooplo In the country are realising more and more every 4$^&apos;that the administration is firm and just, and that its inten-tion is to secure that every individual can go about his business without let or hindrance.Tftien this fact gradually filters into the minds 04 those^ even dwelling in the most disturb0&apos;! and restless areas, we fqol aonfidont that tho curve of unrest will gradually descend, and the curve of confi&amp;enoo will rise.(Sd.)

A OREPORT BY O^TOAL OFFICER COMMAND IKQ* IK-CHI3SF . THE FORCES 111 3&amp;BLANXK TO THB LORD LIBlffiBKANT.GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, IimAND.31et. July, 1918*Your Excellency,I have the henour td submit tho following report on the general situation in Ireland as I found it when X assumed command on 13th  May, 1918f together with a &quot;brief review of the steps which have since been taken and the result of them up to the present time.SITUATION AS. I FQgSB XT..When I arrived in Ireland 1 tos struck with the generally defiant and insubordinate spirit which from my personal observations seemed to be apparent everywhere.    No doubt the question of Conscription had stimulated theee feelings but it soon became apparent to ma that the people in this Country had got into the way of believing that their policy was to defy or disregard orders and regulations and further to believe that nothing very serious was likely to hasten by disobeying them.    Drilling though it had been pronounced illegal was taking place more or less all over Ireland and minor illegal, offences occurred everywhere - in fact, the country certainly had the appearance of being out of hand.strongIn addition to this the/political feeling was every-where apparent.KKASURBS TAKEN,Amongst the many Questions that required attention one oi them * the restoration of law and order - obviously stood out as calling for immediate action^    Your Excellency decided, therefore, a* a first itep. to arrest and place under control, a large number of the Sinn Fein leaders.    Arrangements were at once made to do this in conjunction with the policy and in one night some 70 Sinn Feji leaders wore simultaneously arrested and deported to England.The result of this operation had in my opinion a moat beneficial result.    The secret had been well kept and the arrestg came as a great shock to the Sinn Fein party who had been in the habit of boasting that their leaders were well protected and could not be taken without a fight.The deportation of these leaders undoubtedly dislocated the organization of Sinn Fein for the Time and though new leaders have since been appointed there is no &amp;oubt that they are not as efficient as their predecessors nor have their followers the same confidence in them.&apos;The documents seised at the time these arrests were made gave particulars of the Sinn Fein organization and a large number of names.    The fact that these are known is causing them the greatest Uneasiness.DRILLING.The next question dealt with was illegal drilling.   Energetic steps were taken to put a stop to this with result that at the present time it has almost ceased to exist.- 4 *
9 a n 01 IiSPgCIAL MILITARY AREAS *On my arrival in &quot;Ireland I found the County   of Clare pro-claimed as a Special Military Area and up to a ohort time age I considered it necessary to continue the restrictions.    Aa, however, the people there have latterly commenced to behave in a more law abiding manner I have somewhat relaxed the restriction^ and further relaxation is under   contemplation at the present time.The unwarranted attack made upon   the police in the town of Tralee combined with the behaviour of the inhabitants who did everything possible to conceal and to assist the assailants in escaping, shewed the necessity of declaring Tralee a Special Military Area.    This, with the approval of your Excellency, was * done and has so far brought good results.The proclamation which was issued by me in accordance with your Excellency&apos;s instructions restricting meetings and assemblies to those for which permits are granted by the police is certainly checking seditions and undesirable gatherings of all kinds and wiE I think have a steadying effect upon the whole community*GHpHAI, REMARKS^The measures to which I have referred above together with any other steps whioh have been taken for the general restoration of law and order are bearing fruit.    It is gradually being realised that when orders are issued they must be obeyed and respect for authority is returning.    People with a stake in the country, even though they may be supporters of the Sinn Fein party, are beginning to realise the benefit to be derived from a more orderly state of affairs.To this extent the general tone has in my opinion decidedly improved but I fear I cannot say that I consider the community are in a happier or more contented frame of mind and it is only because of the vigorous and steady policy which is now begng pursued supported by an adequate military force that the country is being kept in checJuThe relations between the troops under ny command and the police are excellent, and I cannot but think that knowledge that the latter will be supported in the execution of their duty to the fullest extent by the military force at my disposal gives them increased confidence and is one of the main factors in producing the general return to law and order which it is- evident is taking place,X have the honour to be, Your Excellency18Most obedient Servant, (Sd)   P.

* This vigorous action was a severe shock to tin extremists who really thought that the,- Government - would not dare to arrest their leaders, and has certainly . . .. lowered the prestige of the Sinn Fein organisation.  &quot; &apos;&apos;Moderate Nationalists are reported to be pleased though afraid to say so openly, .   .The Sinn Feiners see that thqy were mistaken in their-belief that tho Government.was afraid of them, and already an improvement is noticeable in their demeanour.The number of cases of illegal Drilling, 340, re* ported to the Competent Military Authority durlngMay com*-pared with 507 in the preceding month, show a decrease of 167, -  This is no: doubt to some extent due to the distribution of troops throughout the Provinces, and to the co-operation between Military and i?olice for the suppression of disorder and illegal practices.Towards the end of May prosecutions for drilling, which had been interrupted owing to the difficulty in arresting offenders in disturbed districts, were resumed, and the General Officer Commanding-intfChief1 issued a public warning that unless drilling ceased, portion; of Counties Tipperary and Limerick would be proclaimed a special Military Area, which is, expected to have a good result.There were several raids on private houses for anas, and in some of these cases the raiders stole money and valuables.A number of persons were prosecuted under the Unlawful Assembly Clause of the Criminal Law and Procedure Act for cattle-driving, drilling, etc.    There were also a few trials by Court Martial.    At $ne of these a County Council Chair-man was - sentenced to 12: months imprisonment   for. keeping explosives&apos;, etc in contravention of the Defence of the Realm Regulations; at another 4 members of an armed party who raided houses in County Cork, were convicted and sentenc-ed to imprisonment for terras of 18 months, and 12 months.A large number of guns were surrendered %? taken possession of by the Police under the. Arms Proclamation.During -the 4 weeks to May 15th, 1,079 recruits enlisted in &quot;the Army.and Navy - an increase of 364 compared with the preceding Return . .With refefence to the Table of Indictable Offences it will suffice to mention, the following cases iwBjCTA^T. On May 27th, Const.. D. McCarthy, who was undersupervision for refusing to do - duty, tempted to shoot District Inspector Gerity. - *The bullet wounded Sergt.-. Flaherty, in the hand.   Accused returned for trial.....j^ffMLM       On April 30t.h Unionists attaoked an anti-con-script!on meeting.    A riot.ensued and several persona have been made amenable.7 ,
On the night of Hay 18th, Baronecourt Castle, the residence of the Duke of Abercorn, who was, however, abeent from home, was forcibly entered and raided for arms by a party of men, presumably Sinn Feiners. Only 6 old swords were found and taken away.   Daniel Doherty, a local Sinn Fein organizer, was arrested at 4 a.m. apparently returning from the raid.   He is now interned in England.On 28th May during the night, a party of men armed with revolvers raided the G.S.V,-. Kly Station at Athy, locked the watchman in his shed, and took a quantity of petrol from the store.On May 6th. at Ballinatraha, John Dalton murdered hiB daughter-in-law, ifillen Dalton, and set fire to the house.   He has been returned for trial.On May 9th, the house of Hr. Vickere at Carlroe was raided by masked meh who took 2 guns and a field glass.      Owner will claim  30 compensation at Quarter Sessions.On May 29th, at abo;. t 2 a.m. on the   occasion of a raid for arms at Ballinshragh, Thomas Larkin fired at v/illiam Dolan believing him to be one of the raiders and killed him.   Dolan who was riding a bicycle was ordered by Larkin to stop, but continued to ride on.   Larkin is in custody.On same night an armed raid took place at a private house at Losparaghan, when 2 of the party were captured by an ex-Army officer and handed over to Military custody.On the night of April 27th, threatening notices were posted outside the ChapeLo at Abbey, I.ynagh, and Ballinakill in reference to the gracing of a looal farm on b.ehalf of the Abbey Sinn Fein Club, which wants the land for its members.On the night of Uay 9th, 16 cattle were driven off a farm at Abbey.    The police recovered them and put them back.   They were a^ain driven off by the Sinn Feiners who put 14 of their own oatt le on the land.   The Police afforded protection to the occupier of the land while impeinding the trespassing cattle and rousted a body of Sinn Feiners who opposed them.On the nights of May 5th., 12th and 16th shots were fired into houses in Portumna and Ballinasloe Districts.    Motive * intimidation in connection with unpopular allotments of land by the Congested Districts Board.On the evening of 19th Hay Colonel Gordon, A &amp; S. Highlanders, whilst walking from Cork to Kinsale was waylaid by 20 men armed with hurley sticks, who read his letters, and robbed him of his haversack, belt and spurs.8.
pih 1On the night of May let, a party of unknown men knocked at the residence of Mr. J. Mqade,, Belgooly, Kinaale, and said they were Police coming to take up arms.   Mr. Heado said he had-given up hie arms and refused to admit them.   After trying in vain to force the door they fired ehots and left.On night of May 3rd. a party of disguised men knocked at the door of Mr. (McCarthy, Sallinakilla, Charleville, and stated they were Police.   On being admitted they searched the house, found no arms, and stole  18-4s, in cash and a Bank deposit receipt for  350. ,CORK. W.R.      Between May 14th and 22nd at Leap,  130 amount ofcollection for anti-conscription fund was stolen from the houae of Rev, J. 0&apos;Hea, P.P.KiilBRY, On May 6th at 5 p.m. a party of Irish Volunteers,6 of them armed, entered the yard of a farmer named Bonham at&apos;Lickeen, ordered him to hold up hie hands, fired a shot over his head and stole a email,rifle from his.hou3e.   Mrs. Bonham can identify one man hut is afraid to give evidence.(TABL&amp;)&apos;9.

9 9 9 it)   dPART II.The- Ulster Volunteer Force and Grange Order remained &quot;Inactive, hut the latter held a meeting to make arrange-ments for 18th July celebrations which will resume their political character this year.The Parliamentary Nationalist Societies were likewise inactive.     The ancient Order of Hibernians (Board of Erin) is an extensive benefit society and is well organised.The United Irish League branches were more or less apathetic and no attempt was made to revive the national Volunteers.The Sinn x^ein movement&apos; stimulated by the dread of Conscription made further progress notwithstanding the internment of its principal leaders.Local organisers continued their activities through-out the country, and at the end of May 1,293 Clubs, with a Membership of about 105,000, had come under the notice of the Police, showing an increase of 43 Clubs, and about 8,000 Members during the month.The branches of the Cuman na MBan increased from 35 to 80 during the month and many of these 7omen&apos;s Sinn Fein Clubs are now learning first-aid and ambulance work.The Irish Volunteer Force is managed so secret-, ly that it is difficult to ascertain authentic particulars as to the details of its organisation, but it may be assumed that most of the members of Sinn JPein Clubs of military age belong to it.The Internment of the principal leaders has however checked the movement, and although new men are said to have replaced them, it is apparently realised that open illegality cannot be continued in defiance of the manifest determination of government to suppress it.Drilling has been discountenanced by the Clergy, and it showed a marked decline at the end of Hay.   Local leaders have been directed not to risk prosecution and imprisonment.In some remote places the disaffected assembled at night in order to escape detection, but.drilling parties are now being dispersed where possible by police and military; the offenders are tried by Grimes Act Courts or Courts Martial, and it is expeoted that the matter will shortly be well in hand.Attention- 11 -
Attention has been given to the circulation of seditious literature and several searches were made under,D.D.R.A. 51t ,while&apos;disloyal performances in public halls were dealt with by closing the halls under D.0.R.A.51 C.The agreement arrived at between the National-      &apos; 1st and Sinn Fein leaders at the Maynooth Confer-ence on April 18th, to unite their forces for the purpose cf resisting Conscription is not likely to be repudiated so long as the cloud of Conscription impends;   but the hollownoss of the alliance is apparent in tho refusal of cither side to withdraw from the Election contest la East Cavan.The arrest .of the revolutionary leaders, followed by ^the official publication as to their intrigdo with Germany. With the object of revolut-ion, would probably have caused a considerable defection in the ranks of Sinn Fein sympathisers but for the dread of Conscription.mSifrl.Ro&apos;ftKUs6i disavow the alleged intrigue, but thinking Nationalists, familiar with tho cries of &quot;Up the Kaiser&quot;, &quot;Up Germany&quot;, etc at Sinn Fein gatherings, and with the revolutionary professions and incitements of public speakers, and the per-olotent rumours of landing of arms and expected landings on the West Coast, must be sceptical of these disavowals.   Speaking at a meeting at Bally-drummond, Co. Down, on 25th May to protect against the arrests, Mr. King, solicitor, said he did not object to any Irishman entering Into communication with Germany, provided it were for the good of Ireland.Apart from other evidence, documents, etc. found in the possession of several of the Internees when arrest-ed, afford proof of the dangerous and revolutionary character of the movement in which they were engaged, and that their organization, civil and military, had reached an advanced state.The revolutionists have become far less aggress-ivo and defiant and the speakers at Sinn Fein meet-ings more cautious in their language than heretofore, but this change for the better is chiefly, if not altogether, due to firmer government.   They are still bitterly disloyal, and hostile to any form of British rule, and the new leaders when they are identified will have to be   closely watched.Their organization is, however, deficient in arm3 and while a strong military is maintained in Ireland and offences of illegal drilling and train-ing are rigorously punished, a serious rebellion may be regarded as impossible unless In the event of a hostile landing.(Sd.)

REPORT BY INSPECTOR-GENERAL, ROYAL IRISH CONSTABULARY.

FOR MONTH OF JUNE, 1918.

UNDER SECRETARY.

?RT. 1. GENERAL CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY.

I have to report that the political unrest described in previous Monthly reports continued during JUNE; but for this, and from the point of view of material prosperity, the condition of the Provinces was fairly quiet and satisfactory.

Farmers and shopkeepers continued to reap substantial profits from the prevailing high prices.

The various shipyards, mills, factories, and other industries were all active, and there was no lack of employment at good wages.

The only now case of industrial development of importance was the commencement of a railway from Kilkenny to tho Castlecomer Co11lories.

The work of constructing the shipyard at Warrenpoint and the Ford Motor factory at Cork is said to be impeded by difficulties in procuring machinery and materials.

There was on the whole very little friction between employers and workmen, though strikes of labourers and factory hands, generally for an increase of wages, were reported from Antrim, Donegal, Down, Londonderry, Clare, Cork and Tipperary.

Labour is, however, organising all over the country under tho Irish Transport and General Workers Union, and is likely to become a powerful and troublesome force. The Union professes to be non-political, but its recognised journal "Irish Opinion" or "The Voice of Labour" is edited by an advanced Sinn Feiner and the tone of the paper is Sinn Fein. The principal organisers of the union are Sinn Feiners and so also are the members.

It has for some time been one of the aims of the Sinn Fein leaders to enlist tho sympathy and support of the working classes.

During the Month a report was received that a scheme for ruining the harvest by means of a general strike is in contemplation with the object of depriving England of any supplies from Ireland. The Police have been put on the alert, end directed to inquire into this information, which is so far uncorroborated.

There was as usual agrarian agitation in the Counties of Clare and Galway, and to a lessor degree in Kilkenny, Queen&apos;s Co. Mayo and Sligo, and owing to the prevalence of intimidation over 200 persons were afforded Police  protection.

No land purchase of any magnitude took place, and on a few estates rents are withheld with a view to forcing the landlords to agree to sell.

Some


Some efforts were made, but with little success in Kerry and Galway to boycott 2 persons for refusing to sign the anti-conscription pledge.

Attempts were also made to boycott the Police. In parts of Galway  E.R., owing, it is alleged, to the influence of 2 priests and at Eyries in West Cork, they found difficulty in obtaining provisions.

In Clare a comparatively harmless bomb was thrown into the house of a man who had supplied them with turf, but it exploded without doing any damage. In other places they are refused transport.

On the whole, however, after the deportation of the Sinn Fein leaders and the adoption of firmer measures in dealing with lawlessness, some abatement of the hostility towards the Police was noticeable - the County Inspector of Cork, West Riding, reports that everywhere in that County, except at Eyries, the constables employed during the Mouth in the annual collection of agricultural statistics were tested with civility.

The attached Table of Indictable Offences compared with that for the proceeding Month shows a decrease of about 40% which is satisfactory - it will suffice to draw attention to the following cases :-

KERRY.

On June 14th at Tralee a daring attempt was made to murder Sergts. Boyle and Fallon in the street in the presence of about 150 people. They were both returning from the Court House, having given evidence against prisoners charged with perjury (in connection with a raid on Police Barracks in which 2 Sinn Feiners lost their lives) when they were fired at by two men armed with shot guns. Sergt. Fallon was wounded. The onlookers assisted the culprits to escape and thwarted the police in their investigations. One man was arrested but no witness has yet identified him. Tralee has been declared a special military area under the D.R.R.

QUEEN&apos;S CO.

On June 13th at 1 a.m. 4 men, armed and disguised (presumably Sinn Feiners) raided the Wolfhill Colliery Magazine. They held up the workman present, cut the bolts off the door, and took away some coils of fuse. The Police had removed 420 lbs. of gelignite on the previous day.

GALWAY. E.R.

On June 11th John Cullanan received a threatening letter warning him to give up work on a C.D.B. farm at Polluthlugga which the local people want to have divided amongst them. Cullanan has now to work under Police protection.

GALWAY, W.R.                                                                                    On June 13th at 1.15 a.m. 5 rifle shots were fired into the house of Patrick Loughroy at Annagh.  Motive - intimidation in connection with a private matter.

On the night of June 14th Sergt. McIntyre and a constable were fired at on the road at Durrow, by a stranger whom they met riding a bicycle. The

Sergt.
The sergt, recognised him as a man who had drilled a ? to his name. The Stranger drew a revolver and fired at the Police who returned the fire and pursued him into a wood where he escaped.

There was a considerable decrease in the number of raids.

During the 4 weeks to June 15th, only 538 persons enlisted in the Army and Navy.

The anti-conscription campaign and the trend of recent political events have stirred up a bitter feeling against England which, shows no sign of abatement. The young men are unwilling to take part in the War on any terms, and therefore the Police see no prospect of a general and satisfactory response to the Lord Lieutenant&apos;s appeal for 50,000 voluntary recruits, unless it is supported by the Bishops and the Nationalist Party.

Police patrols are &quot;where necessary reinforced by Military patrols from the various detachments now stationed throughout the disturbed Counties, and the disaffected have   uiokly realised that Government is not, as they wore led to believe, afraid of them.towards the end of the llonth regular drill for the purpose of training in military exercises had practically ceased,    Bai&amp;s for arms and other unlawful assemblies, also declined to a considerable extent, which in a groat measure accounts ior the decrease in tho number of Indictable Offences reforred to in Part I,The Cuman na H3an continued to form nor; Branches. The Ostensible reason for this development is that tho women may bo trained to act as ^Oroon Cross&quot; nurses to the wounded should an attempt bo made to enforce Conscription, but the movement is possibly largely spectacular,Public meetings were hold in most of the Counties to protest against tho recent arrests end deportations but the lenguage used was generally more moderate,- Humorous binn lie in concerts-and Gaelic League ^orideachts also took plaoo.3, Those- &quot;2&quot;$&quot; -

On the other hand at Galway the binn Fein candidate for Chairmanship of the County Council was beatCft,The National Defence Fund for the purpose of resisting Conscription is said to amount to a quarter of a million.     Open activities have been suspended by the leaders of this movement pending developments.     The spirit of opposition is however as strong as ever.Dread of Conscription which impelled numbers of young men to join   Sinn Fein who otherwise would not have done so still binds them to it, and they influence their parents and others.It is believed that many of the older Nationalists and some of the young ones approve of the deportation of the Sinn Fein leaders, and of tho firmer action of Government, but are afraid to admit it.The R, I,C, seized 3,600 rounds of rifle ammunition at Portadown Railway station concealed in sacks of oats, consigned by a Belfast Sinn Feiner - McUabb - to another named Slane at Sisnilecroes; 6,000 rounds were seized at Meftabb^ premises in Be]last, and evidence was discovered which enabled the Dublin lietropolitan lolice to seize 40,000 more also concealed in sacks of oats in Dublin.   Slane and three persons in Dublin were arrested, but KciJabb absconded and has not yet been secured.Several shot guns have been seized by the Police in various houses throughout the country, and numerous prosecutions are pending; but there is no reason to believe that any arms have been imported.The punitive action of the Commander-in-Chief in placing certain disturbed areas under Hilitary control, and the generally increased vigour in dealing with the seditious movement, have had a satisfactory and deterrent effect.The revolutionists though more subdued aro not, however, less disloyal, and that they still cont doing some serious mischief was evidenced within the past week by the seizure on the Dublin boat at x.rdroesan of acpaant ity- 36 -
o 4 jquantity of explosives, and the arrest of 8 Sinn Feiners in the act of bringing it over, together with oorrespoud-enoe found on one of thorn.. But so long as an adequate military fores is kept in Ireland and lawlessness is firmly grappled with, any attempt at open rebellion, unless in the event of a Gorman landing, seems improbable.(Signedh W.B3MK*Inspector General.16th July. 1918,
