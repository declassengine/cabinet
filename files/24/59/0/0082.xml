6tSr%90 7ORET.THIS DCCUITI/fT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAlTi&quot;IC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVOTM^THOIJ&apos;.)Ili01?^ THE FORKING CLASSES AFT2R TIP ?&apos;/ARHinute by the Minister of Reconstruction relative to Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies:, the President of the Local Government Board, and tho President of the Board of Agriculture.    (V.rar Cabinet Document G.T. 5231).1.     I do not agree with the proposals contained in this Memorandum, except in one particular, namely, that it is undesirable to announce to Local Authorities that in all cases their loss would be limited to Id. rate, as I agree that this would remove incentives to economy.2.     I think we are all agreed that in the 18 months imme-diately after the war at least 500,000 working-class houses must be built in England and rales, and that the plans for these houses should be ready before the war ends.3.     At the present rate of progress with regard to the preparation of schemes, it does not appear that schemes for the erection of anything like this number of houses will be ready. Over. four,&apos;.months have elapsed since the issue of the Circular of the 18th -March and only 225 Authorities out of 1,800 are known by the Local Government Board to be proposing to prepare schemes. It must be remembered that in many of these cases the Authorities had schemes already prepared or in course of preparation before building operations were stopped by the war.4.     There will be a shortage of houses after the war in practically all the rural districts and in the great majority of the urban districts and towns, and the test of the success of the arrangements made is not as to how many have prepared schemes, but as to how many are not preparing schemes.   It will be no consolation to the soldier&apos; returning to Canterbury to know that Sunderland has bought 24? acres and is embarking on a large Housing scheme.5.     If we are to ensure that the houses are built in adequate numbers in all parts of the country where they are required,.there are three possible agencies for building :-(a) Private Enterpriso (including Public Utility So.cifi.ties)(b) Local Authorities and County Councils;,(c) The State.6.     As regards (a), the existing terms of -financial assistance to Local Authorities are based on partnership in loss.     As it will be impossible to give greater financial assistance to private -enterprise than, to Local Authorities, therefore private enterprise would have to face a loss if it built immediately after the war. The evidence ia overwhelming to the effect that on these conditions private/
2 9. o.private enterprise will make a very trifling contribution in the way of workmen&apos;s houses.   Therefore, the idea of private enterprise male in;; any substantial contribution on the existing terms must be ruled out entirely.7.     As regards (b), a certain number of Local Authorities are likely to orepare adequate schemes for meeting the shortage in their area.   But it is quite clear that a large number will not.   Z do not say that this is due entirely to the nature of the financial assistance offered.&quot;    I believe, from the evidence I have received that a large number of Authorities are against building quite aoart from the risk to the rates.   But I do contend that the certain loss to the rates is an additional inducement to prevent them building. Tow, in the case of those Authorities who refuse to prepare adequate schemes, it is practically impossible to compel them to do so by means of a mandamus, and the proposal is made that County Councils should, be empowered to build where the Local Authority refuses.   I object to this proposal as contained in the Housing Bill on the ground that (1) no definite time is fixed within which a Local Authority can be declared in default and the County Council substituted, and.. (2.-) the County Council is only authorised and not directed to build under these conditions.   In this connection I note that Tt&quot;is stated that llr. Lon;;&apos;s Committee reported, in favour of the Bill.     I have signed no Report to this effect; and as a Jember of Er, Long&apos;s Committee, I wish to record my dissent from the suggestion that the proposals in the Bill arc adequate.I would further point out that in the case of County Boroughs who do not intend to build, the County Councils cannot be substituted, and it appears that several County Boroughs will not pre.are adequate schemes.     I quote tho cases of Canterbury and Gateshead where there is a great shortage of houses, and where, so far as my information goes, there is no intention whatever of preparing a scheme.6.     There remains the third agency/namely, the State   The Committee on the Housing-Bill definitely rejected my proposal that the State should build, if necessary, in any case.   This means that where the Local Authority and the County Council do not prepare schemes, no houses will be provided and no steps will be taken to remedy this.9.     Iy. conclusion, therefore, is that either the financial terms must be altered so as to make them more attractive to Local Authorities and make it possible for the various forms of private enterprise to build, or it must be made clear that where the Local Authority or the County Council is required to prepare adequate schemes, - . the State will act in default and impose a rateupon the Authority in the event of default.10.     One or other of these, alternatives must, it appears to me be adopted if an adequate number of houses are to be built immediately after the war.   It will be a lasting disgrace if on demobilisation adequate preparations are not in hand to secure that all returning soldiers and sailors can obtain a decent home;   and they must be able to obtain it in their own district if they so wish.I would specially-emphasise the importance of this in the rural areas, as on demobilisation the question as to whether our rural ipopula-tion/
239:3:population is to be increased or not will largely depend on whether preparations have been made for building a large number of cottages.   The men will not return to the villages without a prospect of a good home.   The shortage of rural cottages before the war was estimated at .120,000, and this shortage is increased by at least 30,COO owing to our recent agricultural policy.August 1st 1918,CADDISOK.
