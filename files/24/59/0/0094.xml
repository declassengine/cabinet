Involving a Stoppage of Work. The strike of ironmoulders at Sheffield continues.   Unrest is reported among the rivetters at Go van.(6.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. Notices to strike on the 10th August have been handed in by the Dublin bakers. A strike is also threatened by rivetters at Newcastle owing to dissatisfaction with an award of the Committee on Production.I.-General Remarks.Close of the Embargo Strike.In last week&apos;s report the narrative ofthe strike was carried down to the 25th July. At that date about 11,000 munition workers were on strike in Coventry and about 12,000 in Birmingham. These figures did not appreciably increase, though short cessations of work occurred in Leicester, and at Newcastle, which may be considered as practically adjournments from work to discuss the situation. Throughout the country vigorous attempts were being made to arouse feeling against Government. Two meetings of importance were held on the 25th July. At a meeting of the Trade Union Advisory Committee a resolution was passed asking the Minister of Munitions to call on the firm or firms at Coventry which had issued the misleading notice, to cancel it, and also requesting Government, when the men resumed work, to setup a commission of enquiry. A second resolution, stating that Government had acceded to that request, called on the strikers to return to work immediately.On the same day a meeting of delegates of the men from all parts of the country Was taking place at Leeds. About 80 to 90 attended, claiming to represent 300,000 workers in a score of trade unions associated with the engineering joint committees in various districts. With only one dissentient the delegates voted, according to the mandates they had received, to strike on the 30th July unless the embargo was removed. Before the vote was taken they had received news of the meeting in London. After the decision had been made the delegates expressed their willingness to meet any representatives of the Ministry who had power to remove the embargo.[1100-40] - B
2At this stage it is beyond doubt that any sign of weakness or careless handling of the situation might have led to a general stoppage, at least in the Midlands, in Lancashire, and in the London districts. There was, however, the clearest evidence that while suspicion was present everywhere, and the younger men were once more anxious to pit their own influence against that of the union officials, there was no general desire to strike. In Coventry itself the wage levels are peculiarly uneven, owing to the diversity of conditions and methods in which munition work has been extended. Messrs. Hotchkiss, who Avere responsible for the misleading notice, had established a high rate while working for the French Government, and had resented their treatment by the Ministry of Munitions. Whatever ill effect had been caused by the notice, and by the garbled interpretations of the embargo system which had been based on it was dispelled by the correcting statement. But apart from this there was widespread feeling that the occasion was not a suitable one for a strike. In a Lancashire town women munition workers held a mass meeting to denounce a strike, and even in Coventry itself the wives of the workers were far from supporting the men. The Prime Ministers announcement on the 26th July that Government was determined to cancel the protection certificates of strikers who remained out on the 29th July was thus welcomed by large sections of workers not less than by the general public. By the following day men were already returning to work in both Birmingham and Coventry, and on the 29th July work had been largely resumed, though, it was not till the 30th that the strike ceased completely.The termination does not imply that the danger is completely over. Meetings continued to be held, especially in London, on the 27th and 28th July to affirm the decision arrived at in Leeds on the 25th July. At a second meeting in Leeds of about 3,000 local men held on the 28th July it was said: &quot;The miners had beaten the Government, Ireland had defeated the Government, and the A.S.E. would destroy the Government.&quot; This may be taken as expresssing the attitude of the immediate promoters of the strike. More importance, however, lies in the fact that they were only able to obtain what support they did because of the resentment which was so widely felt at the belief that Government was attempting industrial conscription without a previous agreement with the unions and without a clear statement of intention. While firmness has been successful, this does not carry with it an assurance that Government has a free hand in the future. It is understood that the War Munitions Volunteer Scheme is tacitly in abeyance. If at any time it is revived frankness and co-operation will be needed. At meetings held this week in London and Manchester it was made clear that notices are only held in abeyance pending the result of the enquiry, and a claim was made for full publicity in case new restrictions were imposed. The promise by the Minister in reply to a question on the 29th July that the main committee will have power to appoint local sub-Committees to investigate local conditions should go far to meet objections which have been raised.II. Press Comments.Military Affairs.The &quot; New Statesman &apos;.&apos; lays stress on the dissipation of the legend of German invincibility by the victory on the Marne, and the effectiveness of the Americans which is largely due to their being all of the best military age. At the same time the Allies have not succeeded in breaking through, though this might have been possible at Soissons.Russia.The labour papers are still opposed to any form of Allied intervention in Russia, and the &quot;Herald&quot; devotes a number of articles to this topic. Like other papers it regrets the murder of the Czar on grounds of common humanity. Mr. Brailsford, in a speculative article, doubts the possibility of any successful Government emerging in the near future. The contest will turn on a battle between Germany and the Allies a year or two hence for the possession of the minerals of the Ural mountains and the routes to India. He is pained that the Allied Socialist and Labour Parties have chosen to keep silence, and a leading article emphasises this reflection, believing that the action of the Allies will throw7 the Russian people into the arms of the Germans. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; blaming the British Government for refusing to give any information to
Parliament, says that a policy which is ashamed of the light of day cannot be honour-able. A strong demand appears in the &quot; Call&quot; on behalf of the Russian revolution. If the Soviet is overthrown a military dictatorship will take its place, gradually evolving into restoration of the Monarchy. The &quot; New Statesman/&apos; on historical grounds, feels that the murder of the Czar may prove the turning-point in the revolution.Peace Propaganda.In the Labour press pacifism is tinged by Mr. Snowden&apos;s sudden admiration of the House of Lords. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; considers Mr. Balfours reply to the speech of the Ge rman Chancellor as calculated to serve the aims of the German statesmen if they are insincere in their offers of peace. Lord Wimborne&apos;s speech, on the other hand, is highly praised. There are sufficient peers holding similar views to form a very influential group, and exercise a strong influence upon the policy of Government. &quot; Justice &quot; however, ridicules Mr. Arthur Henderson for his hasty acceptance of a verbal report on the attitude of the German Majority Socialists. The same paper prints extracts from an article by Hermann Muller, in &quot;Die Neue Zeit&quot; of the 5th July, with comments by Grumbach, indicating the real attitude of the German Majority. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; while not abating its objects to the &quot; Lansdowne Labour Committee,&quot; repudiates any attempt to link the socialist and labour movement with a reactionary Conservative like Lord Lansdowne.General Election.&quot; Common Sense&quot; the organ of the Lansdowne &quot; peace by negotiation party &quot; sees in the recent speeches of Mr. Henderson and the secession of Mr, Hodge a tendency on the part of the Labour party to approximate to its views. It fears, however, that if the coalition were to dissolve, the Conservative party might return with a clear majority. To avoid this it calls urgently, but not very hopefully, for improved leader-ship from the Liberal chiefs. The Labour press seems at present a little shy of committing itself, though calling strongly for funds. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot; Herald &quot; are inclined to define the issues at such an election as &quot; disarmament, or militarism,&quot; and the latter insists that the League of Nations after the war must be a League not of militarist Governments but of the pacific peoples.Free Speech.Complaints are made by the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; on the arrest of Mr. H. A. Campbell, of the Australian Labour party, for daring&apos; to speak disrespectfully of Mr. Lloyd George, and at the acion of the Manchester police in prohibiting&apos; a service of intercession for peace. This theme is developed more fully in the &quot; Herald &quot; which describes the Defence of the Realm Act as the capitalists&apos; barbed wire and says that the abolition of the Act must be placed in the forefront of the Labour programme.The U.D.C.A sarcastic article in &quot;Justice&quot; criticises the Union of Democratic Control. Its practices render it unnecessary for the German Government to carry on propaganda in Great Britain. Not that the U.D.C. is capable of selling its country, of whose freedom it takes full advantage.   On the contrary it quite freely gives its country away.Embargo Strike.The feebleness of the case for the men is clear from the fumbling character of comments in the Labour press.&quot;Justice&quot; and the &quot;Clarion&quot; take the patriotic view that the strikers are endangering the men at the front, and their country. Only the &quot; Workers&apos; Dread-nought&quot; and the &quot;Woolwich Pioneer &quot; venture to assume that the notice put up in Messrs. Hotchkiss&apos;s shops represents the real attitude of the Ministry of Munitions. Other papers find much difficulty in assigning any cause for the strike. The &quot;Call&quot; thinks that a public announcement of policy might have prevented even the threat of a strike. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; describes the trouble as not an ordinary trade dispute but a matter in which employers and workmen are ranged together against the Ministry of Munitions.   It ascribes one cause to the resentment of workmen at not
4being able to move freely to establishments where they can obtain higher pay. This cause is singled out by the &quot; Clarion&quot; for special condemnation.The &quot; Herald&quot; publishes a number of notes obviously by different hands and drawing different conclusions. Its main argument is the usual condemnation of Government as always being m the wrong&apos;,&apos; because Labour, like everybody else, is unable to believe a single word Government says about anything. &quot;Whatever is pro-posed the workers have a suspicion, generally well founded, that something else is meant. At the same time it does not see how men who did not strike to prevent conscription can logically delay the munitions required by the conscripts. It traces the actual course of events to initial unrest caused by the War Munition Volunteers Scheme, followed by a failure to ensure mobility of labour by entrusting unions with the running of the scheme. The failure to produce a Bill for the restoration of Trade Union conditions, and other complaints, culminating with the dismissal of Rock, the shop steward whose case led to the aeroplane strike, have all contributed. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; and the VNation&quot; ascribe the trouble to suspicion of the methods of Government, uneven recruiting, and the failure to work through the unions.Cotton Control Board.An echo of the Coventry strike is heard in fresh charges against the action of the Cotton Control Board in abolishing the &quot;Rota&quot; system, which is now interpreted by the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and the &quot;Herald&quot; as an attempt to introduce industrial conscription by forcible drafting of the Cotton Operatives, who will be permanently unemployed.The Internationale.Recent resolutions by the French General Federation of Labour and Majority Socialists are hailed by the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and the &quot;Herald&quot; as distinct advances towards the reconstitution of the Internationale. The &quot; Call&quot; publishes the first article of the promised symposium (signed W. A. M. M.). This condemns the change in the basis of the Internationale from socialism to labour. It is now clear there can be no Internationale outside socialism, and this, moreover, must not be in name or essence, national. The first requisite of the new Internationale must be that its members place the class war above the nation, the class worker above national unity, and the revolution above national defence. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; desires a meeting of the Internationale on the ground that it can do no harm and may do good.Whitley Committees,The &quot;New Witness&quot; and &quot;Co-operative News-&quot; approve of the opposition raised by the London District Committee of the A.S.E. to Whitley Councils, on the ground that they deliver the men bound to their employers. On the other hand, in the &quot;Engineer&quot; the Sheffield correspondent of the journal traces improved relations to the Whitley Report, and discusses the possibility of bringing the two interests closer together.Food Production.Lord Lee&apos;s resignation is noted only by the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; which deplores the withdrawal of men from agriculture as likely to have little effect for military purposes, while entailing losses more serious than those of a battle. Mr. Hyndman, in &quot; Justice,&quot; blames the Board of Agriculture for delaying its work at the beginning of the war and for not insisting on the proper use of prisoners at a later stage.The Consumers&apos; Council.Mr. Hyndrnan, in &quot;Justice,&quot; praises Mr. Hoover and the self-denial of the people ofthe United States. He is still sceptical about the amount of subsidy required for cheap bread.
5370III. District &quot;Reports.London and South-Eastern.The situation in this area has been considerably disturbed during the past week, though the unrest displayed has not developed to any serious degree.Upon the question of embargoes the general feeling seemed to be averse to a strike, though the men generally considered their case was good and were prepared to take action should this seem advisable.The engineers at Erith, Crayford, and Dartford resolved to abide by the decision of the Shop Stewards&apos; Conference in London, while two meetings of the A.S.E. at the Euston Theatre and East Ham, as well as the Woolwich workmen, resolved to strike on the 30th July should the embargo scheme not be removed by then. The London District Committee of the Engineering Trade Unions, on the other hand, protested against the scheme and determined to call mass meetings for further consideration of future action.The Workers&apos; Union has had under consideration a proposed system of interport committees for dealing with grievances in Admiralty dockyards, as they are dissatisfied with the present system.South-W ester n.This district has remained quiet.In Gloucestershire no sympathy was displayed with the men on strike at Coventry, though, had the strike become general, it is probable that they would have joined. At Southampton it was decided to continue work pending investigation into the facts of the dispute, while in Bristol little excitement was aroused.-West Midlands.The situation in this district has cleared. Largely owing to the firm attitude adopted by the Government, work has now been resumed in practically all cases. Public feeling in Coventry was strongly against the strike.The National Union of Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers and Sailors, at a meeting at Birmingham on the 25th, passed a resolution of protest against the action of the strikers and determined to remain at work at all costs, while the Discharged Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Federation appear to have adopted the same attitude.Some fear has arisen of a strike of the employees in the Electric Supply Depart-ment at Birmingham, which would involve the closing down of all factories. It is hoped, however, that in the event of a strike it may be possible to replace the electricians.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The situation in this district has improved, though it still remains considerably disturbed.At Nottingham and Leicester resolutions in favour of remaining at work were passed, though in the former case a protest was made against the action of the Govern-ment in issuing instructions to employees without previous consultation of the unions. At Leicester about 3,000 members of the Iron Trades Confederation came out on the 25th, but resumed work almost immediately, after deciding to send delegates to Leeds. At Lincoln also a general strike was threatened, but was deferred until after the Conference at Leeds referred to in Part I of this report.North-Western.The situation in this district was serious, and some fear was expressed that the men in Manchester might come out upon the embargo question, without consideration of the action taken by the Coventry men. The shop stewards, indeed, were in favour of a strike, but a considerable element among the men does not seem to have been eager to take drastic action, and no mass meetings were held in Manchester over the week-end.The Liverpool Reconstruction Committee resolved to take no action since the matter did not affect Liverpool individually. Barrow delegates to the first Leeds conference were instructed to support a strike if the embargo were not withdrawn.[1100-40] - C
(5At a mass meeting of the A.S.E. at Liverpool on the 28th much blame was attached to the Government for entering upon the scheme without consultation with the unions, whilst a protest was entered against statements blaming pro-Germans for the disturbance.The boilermakers at Barrow are showing unrest, alleging that they have not received the last award, while the employees of the Vulcan MotOr Company, at Southport, are agitating for a forty-seven hour week. Various agitators at the Gorse and Lilac mills are also stirring up a movement to demand payment for time spent in holding meetings during work hours, but many even of the more extreme shop stewards will not support them.Northern.The situation in this area is satisfactory, and, though some unrest was occasioned by the embargo question, this did not develop to any serious extent.Although the engineers at Elswick and Scotswood were brought out by the efforts of the shop stewards for a short time, and feeling against the Ministry of Munitions was bitter, general opinion was not in favour of a strike. The A.S.E. officials, who were distinctly opposed to any strike, had lost control of the men.A meeting of the A.S.E. on the 27th, called to consider the embargo question, proved to be very disorderly owing to numerous interruptions. A resolution to arrange for a ballot on the question of giving support to the Coventry strikers was carried, but the general tone of the meeting did not seem to be in favour of striking.South Wales.With the exception of the strike of gasworkers at Merthyr, the position generally seems to be quiet and undisturbed throughout this district, and no agitation among munition-workers has been reported.The clerical staff of the Ebbw Vale Steel and Iron Company has ceased work in consequence of the general wages dispute of mineworkers other than miners.Scotland.Matters in this area have been a little disturbed during the past week, while work was not started after the holidays in a very good temper. This was largely due to resentment at the action of the magistrates in closing the public-houses.The unrest among the riveters, who are agitating for equal rates and higher pay, is increasing, and some are still on strike.The Coventry dispute did not create much discussion, though there was some apprehension that the men might be induced to join in. Various agitators were engaged in addressing meetings, at which tliey urged the workers to strike and throw off their shackles once for all.The C.W.C. pledged itself to do all in its power to get the men out, and a delegate was despatched to Coventry to obtain further details.Some young men, who were arrested for their part in the meeting to protest against the imprisonment of John McLean, appeared at the police court on the 26th and were remanded until a future date. Another demonstration is being arranged for the 4th August.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.With the exception of the strikes over the question of embargoes, the reports this week are few in number and are not on the whole of very serious importance.The Admiralty Labour Department reports that the riveters and their assistants at Messrs. Barclay Curie and A. Stephen and Sons, Govan, are still on strike, owing to their claim for the 20 per cent, advance granted to certain classes of men on &quot; lieu &quot; rates. The Boilermakers&apos; executive instructed the men to return to work pending a ballot vote upon the question. But at the meeting, which broke up in disorder, the men decided against a resumption.The platers&apos; helpers at Smith&apos;s Dock Company, Newcastle, who demanded to be paid by the firm instead of by the platers, resumed work on the 23rd, after an award by the Committee on Production, with which they show considerable dissatisfaction.
to rj *d i i7Work has been resumed at Messrs. Swan Hunter and Wigram Richardson. The moulders at Sheffield have not yet returned to work.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 13,696 workpeople involved in strikes for the week ending the 24th July.The strikes upon the embargo question involved 11,000 workers at Coventry and 12,000 at Birmingham, while the employees of forty-five Manchester firms had given notice to cease work on the 30th.The employees of the Workington Iron and Steel Company struck on the 24th, owing to a claim for help in filling coke, or in the alternative for a higher wage.The strikes in the nut-and-bolt industry, Darlaston, have ended, the men having accepted an advance of 1\ per cent, on piece-work rates.The War Office Contracts Department has no new stoppages of work to report.Negotiations are proceeding as to the strike of cotton operatives in South Lanca-shire, but some danger has arisen of the dispute spreading to other parts of the district. The dispute at Wigan has been settled.The Coal Controller has two new stoppages of work to report, involving 6,940men.Several stoppages continue in South Wales, the most important being one at the Risca Colliery, which the men consider unsafe, owing to an underground fire. Precau-tions directed by the Home Office are being taken. A short strike also occurred at the Cannock Collieries, on account of a man who was in arrears with his union subscription.Work has been resumed at the Easington Colliery, the men having accepted negotiations by an Urgency Committee.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of W^ork.The Admiralty Labour Department have few controversial cases of any importance to report.The riveters at Messrs. Palmers Shipbuilding Company, Newcastle, threatened to cease work on the 12th owing to dissatisfaction with an award by the Committee on Production granting an increase of 20 per cent, to certain &quot; Lieu &quot; workers. Notices to cease work have, however, been withdrawn after negotiations between the Ship-building Employers&apos; Federation and the men&apos;s union.The National Union of General Workers have complained to the Miyiistry of Munitions that at Anderson Grice Company, Carnoustie, the manager has stopped the night shift because two men have been called up. In consequence many women workers have been thrown out of employment, and the output of munitions has been seriously decreased.About 300 Cornishmen employed in iron and steel works in Lincolnshire have threatened to strike unless they are given holiday leave for harvesting at their own homes.At the Carron Company, Falkirk, the char fillers left the firm owing to dissatisfac-tion with an award of the Committee on Production. They now object to their places being filled, and hope to force the firm to grant them an advance.Their action is supported by the iron-stone miners.The War Office Contracts Department has one new controversial case to report.At Messrs. Wright, Brothers, Northampton, who are engaged upon packing cases, a dispute arose owing to the dismissal of three men on account of shortage of timber.Several applications have been made to the Committee on Production by unions in the textile trade for an advance of 12-^- per cent, in wage rates, while the National Amalgamated Union of Engineers, Foremen Mechanics, Motormen, and Electrical Workers have claimed an advance of 20s. on pre-war rates, a bonus of 12^ per cent., and shorter working hours.The Coal Controller reports two new disputes.The Cumberland Enginemen&apos;s Union have called a strike owing to the reduction of a loco driver for carelessness and insubordination.The miners and surfacemen&apos;s associations are asking that the war wage of 3s. and Is. 6d. per day shall be paid for substituted shifts and overtime. In the former case, to which strong objection was raised three weeks ago, an offer of concession has been made, but the payment for overtime has been refused./
8The dispute in the Forest of Dean is not yet settled, though negotiations are proceeding.A strike is threatened among the Dublin bakers, who have handed in notices to cease work on the 10th August. Their demand is for an increase of 11. A dispute involving clerical workers in the munition factories in Ireland is also threatened, owing to a demand for the 12^-per cent, award. Work will cease on the 19th August unless a settlement is reached.The Committee on Production heard last week fifty-five cases in all. Of these, thirty-eight were in London, seven in Cardiff, and ten in Glasgow.The most important of these were a claim by representatives of the engineering and foundry trades; a claim for increased wages to men, women, and children in the soap and candle trade; another by the Joint Committee of the Light Metal Trades Unions for 100 per cent, above pre-war rates; and lastly, an application by building trade operatives in the aircraft industry for an advance of lOd. an hour.The question has also been raised as to whether the 12^ and 7\ per cent, bonuses are applicable to certain grades of workmen in the Post Office Stores at Holloway and Birmingham.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 151 differences for the week ending the 27th July, twenty-five of which are claims for the Va\ per cent. The greater number continue to fall in the engineering, shipbuilding, and metal trades group. The total number of differences reported for the month of July is 637.D. J. SHACKLETON.o
