:rupw\RY, Q31 m^KXDV in &apos;o:tiiVi?iOK19th - 25th July, 1910,. HiHK-&apos;^HASOE.       here has &quot;been a further general decline this week In the mark exchange.   In Copenhagen the exchange fell from 56.913 on July 17th to 52*75 on July 23 rd.     In the same period the rate in Zurich fell from 69.30 to 66.78 and in Stockholm from 49*26 to 50*   !?here was a slighter fall in Amsterdam and christiania.* SffllJiffi (Oho United States Authorities anticipate arenewed shortage of fuel in the United States during tho coming win) ter and they are proposing to cut down the exports of coal to Canada.    The Canadian output of fuel, owing to tho  calling up of the Canadian miners, has already fallen from 8,000,000 tons to 5,000,000 tons por annum.     It will he necessary for the Canadian Fuel Controller $0 deliver some 45,000 tons of coal monthly at Halifax and this will necessitate a considerable restriction of the output of the Dominion Iron and Steel Companion,   The Canadian *uel Controller says it is essential that no more minors should be called to the colours In Canada.She Germans have renewed their commercial Agreement with Denmark as from Aug. 1st to Deo. let 1918*   They have agreed to supply Denmark with 400,000 tone of coal during this period and with specific quantities of salt, potash, stearins, calcium chloric paraffin, turpentine oil, sugar beet seed and clover seed.   They will send 12,800 tons of iron and steel goods per month, 2,200 tons of shipbuilding materials per month, and 600 tons of benzine and petroleum per month.The Germans will receive in exchangej-(a) 300 tons of tallow and industrial fats.(b) 35-;n of the Danish surplus of butter and eggs.(c) BG&apos;;b of the cattle and meat surplus.(d) 2,500 horses per month.(e) 2,100 tone of fish per month, and (i) cryolite according to arrangement.
142The Danes have agreed to keep the price of Danish butter offered to the United Kingdom  at 60 Crowns per cask below thoprice paid by Romany.   The prices will accordingly be as follows:^ritin]l JgAg  . Gorman ?rioe.Crowns,August   m   . *. 350 400September . gygOctober &amp; November     400 i*r,Lord Reading believes that there is now some prospect of the United States War Trade Board coming to terms with the Danish delegates at Washington in regard to Danish shipping.   The Danish delegates have intimated that Denmark will be satisfied if oho retains only 250,000 tons of shipping for Danish services.   This will leave 450,000 tone for the Allies,   The Danes stipulate that the ton-nage reserved to then) for fetching Danish supplies from overseas shall be allowed to proceed outward in ballast;    but the United states v/ar Trade Board do not think they will insist upon this condition.   The United states Shipping Authorities are inclined to close with the Danish offer, as they do not think that tho Germans will allow tho status quo in regard to Danish shipping to continue if these negotia-tions are broken off.     There are at present 600,000 tony of Danish shipping in Allied service a, but the Germans may at any moment insistHiupon the Danish shipowners laying up the bulk of their shipping.   In this event we shoulct have to requisition such of the Danish shipping as happened to be accessible.    The United States Authorities estimate that the amount of Danish shipping to be obtained by requisitioning would not exceed 350,000 tons.   They have probably under-estimated the figure.   There are at least 250,000 tons at present in British ports .    A further complication in threatened by a demand which the Germans have put forward this week that not more than half the Danish tonnage surrendered to the Allies shall be used in the danger sone.
143TJLIt will hardly bo worth while accepting tho Danish dipping offer unless Donmerk is prepared to meet us in the matter of Danish exports to Germany, especially as the Danish delegates are now uak-ing for imports of fodder and fertilisers.   H hare consistently opposed this suggestion hitherto, since imports of (fodder and fortij iaers into Denmark must necessarily increase the amount of Danish produce available for export to the enemy.   H.K. Government have sent to fashlngton a memorandum on the&apos; restriction?.- considered noc-essary for limiting these exports,    hero should be no exports of hides and leather to Germany;   the exports of Danish cattle should be limited to 6,000 head per week and ox horses to So,000 head per annum.   Germany should only receive 50$ of the Danish surplus of bacon and eggs after the requirements of Scandinavia have been met,Tho Sormans have captured and taken into port three Danish Steamers carrying coal from the United Kingdom,   The Danish Govern-meat assume that the German patrol in diverting these ships mistook their instructions and they expect them to be released immediately. Meanwhile the Danish authorities have instructed all Danish coal ships, until tho matter has been cleared up, to keep to Danish territorial waters both on the outward and inward voyage.fSBjgff.   The German Government have formally notified the Swedish Oov-eminent that, as Swedish exports to Germany have been restricted by an agreement between Sweden and the Allied Powers, Germany will be obliged to take measures to protect German interests.   The Swedish Government anticipate that the German reprisals will take the form of a further restriction of German exports to Sweden.   The Swedish delegates who recently went to Berlin to negotiate with the German Authorities returned on July 20th.   It Is reported that they have arranged for the import of 150,000,tons of German coal Into Sweden during August.Importing Associations have now been formed in Sweden to con-trol tho most important classes of poods to be imported under the new Swedish Agreement.      The Associations will guarantee that the
II 1411 4*goods imported are distributed and used in accordance with the con-ditions laid down in tho Agreement.   Their declarations will be I authorised by tho H&amp;ndelskommlstd on and will be binding on the I Associations and on Individual importers under the Swedish tfar Trade Law.     Tho Handelskommisa ion will furnish the Inter-Allied ?rado Committee at Stockholm with tho manifests of all ships bringing goodi to Sweden under Association guarantees and will communicate monthly statistics of the imports of all rationed articles in the month following their discharge.    H.I.;* Government are asking the Swedish Government to arrange for Association guarantees to be given in respect of goods Imported from Norway and Denmark.Certain foodstuffs will bo imported direct by the Swedish &quot;ood Commission and will be contributed by card.   The distribution will be effected by wholesale grocers, acting as agents of the Oommifi aion.   Tho Commission will furnish the I.A.T.C. at Stockholm with the names of their distributing agents and the committee may object to any particular distributor.   It may be necessary to allow blacklisted persons and firms to act as distributors in oases where the Commissio regard them as indispensable, but we shall try to restrict as far as possible the participation of such firms in the scheme.   The Commie-sion will require guarantees from all their agents and will obtain fortnightly returns of their sales.   The Commission will take over all the goods already purchased in North and South America by Swed-ish firms.    Future Purchases will be financed by ^syndicates of Swedish dealers.   They will roo ;ive a commission for financing the purchases but will have no ownership in the goods or any part in their distribution.BTH1BMNDS*      Sir W. Townley has now received proposals from theNetherlands Government for resuming negotiations for a general agree-notment.   These proposals are clearly/intended to help matters to a conclusion.   The main lines of the proposed Agreement were exhaustive ly discussed in London last Dec umber and an agreement was reached on
145mIf5.iall important points.   The Ifetherlan&amp;s Government however propose to discuss again most of the. queutions at issue and they make no defin-ite counter-proposals regarding the specific points which they desire to raise.   They complain that tho proposed ration for the Dutch im-ports of oils and fats is insufficient and   state that owing to changed agricultural conditions- in Holland, they will require supplies of artificial manure and fodder from overseas.The Netherlands Government apparently desire to gain time until they have secured an Agreement with Germany which will ensure them supplies of German coal and iron.   The Germans are deliberately pro-longing their negotiations with Holland.   They anticipate that as win ter approaches the Dutch will become increasingly anxious regarding their fuel supplies.   The Germans make no secret of the fact that the; require Dutch cattle and horses in order to supplement their supplies of leather and hide;-.    Meanwhile they intend If possible to prevent the Dutch from obtaining their coal from the United Kingdom.   They demand that the Dutch shall limit to 10,000 tons tho amount of ship-ping henceforth employed In trade between Holland and Great Britain.GBRMAH SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.,  The following is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which were reported in the period July 19-25, inclusive.
