Since then, I awe received a notion the rolling stook position in Italy, written by Signor Berrini, the Deputy Director-General of State Railways.Sipior Berrini has been sent to Paris specially to lay this matter before the Inter-Allied Transportation Council, which he did on the 18th instant.   Re produced, in addition to the memoranda mentioned above, a diagram (a copy of which is attached) which shows the daily loading of Italian wagons for all purposes since July 1915, and separately for military and non-military purposes.   A copy of this diagram is attached showing the sta&amp;dy rise in the demands for military purposes and the corresponding decrease, as the result, in the number of Wagons available for other than military purposes.In  ar&amp; : 4 of the General Review of the Y/agon position in France, submitted by me on the 13th July last, I alluded to the fact that about 10,000 Frenon Wagons had been detained in Italy but that steps were being taken to insist on these wagons &quot;being Xs a turned. As a matter ox fact, the balance in Italy to-day of $reach wagons Is stated by the Italians to be about 6,500, which shows that efforts have been made by Italy to reduce tho balance.It Is quite plain that Italy has depended upon the use of French wagons arriving in Italy for internal purposes, and now that Italy has had to return French wagons, she is feeling very (severely the want of theia.Almost simultaneously with Signor Berrini*s visit to Paris, Mr. Purdie, the representative of the Ministry of Shipping in Italy, called to see me and informed me that very serious trouble was being experienced at the Ports and that, in hisn opinion, the only solution to the whole question was an immediate inorease in the rolling stock of Italy.On the 19th instant I arranged for a meeting of the Inter-Allied Transportation Council with M.01aveille, the Minister of EuMic Works In Paris, and Signer Berrini was also present.The denands for assistance by Italy were discussed, vis;1.   The French &quot;pool&quot; of wagons should provide for the conveyance by rail of all coal at present sent by that means to Italy.2.   The French &quot;pool&quot; should lend 10,000 wagons to Italy, pendingS.   The construction of 10,000 wagons for Italy in America.Copy attached.
In regard to (l):   It was agreed that the JPrenoh &quot;pool&quot; oould not possibly undertake the provision of the  wagons for the purpose, and that the only possible relief would lie in a reduction in or discontinuance of the all-rail method of transporting coal to Italy, wad substituting therefore the all-sea method.   This suggestion had previously been brought inio consideration vide (b) of ;r;, Jfonute A.66 dated 13th July, 1918, to your a dre3s.   It was suggested that the shortest way of giving relief would be that the Inter-Allied Maritime Council should undertake the transport by sea of all coal destined for Italy at present sent to the Girronde Ports. This would amount to 4,000 to 5,000 tons a day, and after allowing for wagons required in Italy to distribute this coal on arrival at Italian Porte, would result in setting free between 3,500 and 4,000 Italian wagons for service in Italy.In regard te        it was agreed that under tho present circumstances obtaining in France, it was not possible to loan to Italy 10.000 wagons, and it was further agreed in regard to (a) that the construction of 10,000 wagons for Italy in America presented very great difficulties, since te meet the ultimate requirements of the American Army by Import to France, it would be necessary for America to send over in all something like 100,000 wagons which would require to be constructed in that country.   Moreover, the French Government have, with the permission of the American Government, placed a large order for wagons in America, and nothing should, in the &quot;opinion of the Inter-Allied Transportation Council, be   . allowed to interfere with the fulfilment of either the American ox French programme of wagons under provision from America.Assistance to Italy not therefore being possible from France or. America, the question as to whether assistance could be given from British railways w&amp;s raised, and I informed the Italian representatives that in that respect I was not in a position to hold out any hopes.The Council finally decided that I should lay the matter before tho British Government, asking that assistance should be given to Italy if possible with British wagons, and further that I should lay before the Allied Maritime Transport Council the possibility of substituting the all-sea method of transporting coal to Italy to the relief of the railways, as suggested above.I am of opinion that assistance must be given to Italy in wagons, otherwise she will be unable to maintain the war effert she is making to-day, and further that if assistance in wagons is not given the transportation situation in Italy will become critical.   I further consider that the xjuickest method of relieving Italy 13 necessary, bearing in mind the possibility that Italy may be called upon to carry out important Military movements this year, which movements will be additional to any that she is called upon to make at present.I am of opinion that it is not possible to meet all Italy1s demands for assistance in wagons, such as have now been put forward, but on consideration of the fthole matter I am. of opinion that assistance should be given in two waysj-(a)   By subatitntlng all-sea transport for all-rail transport of the coal now handled in the Girronde Ports which, as shown above, should result in the benefit to Italy of 3,500 to 4,000 wagons;
(b)   By making available 6,000 British wagons to be sent to France, and French railways should be asked to lend an equivalent mimber of their own pattern wagons to Italy,, whioh would save the necessity of making special arrangements in Italy for the maintenance of British pattern wagons.In all 10,000 wagons are requiredt \.Assistance should be given to Italy in material from both Britain and Aoierida, to enable Italy to complete an existing programme and undertake a new programme of construe-tion of wagons, :the total under both heads being equivalent of 11,600 wagons. . Some of the material for this purpose has already been granted special priority, chiefly by Great Britain, but also by America.I have not approached the French Government in any proposal suoh as is suggested under (b), as it is ... obvious that it ie no use approaching the subject unless ! the wagons can be promised from England and it is known whether these wagons will be fitted with lengthened buffers and screw Couplings1, as has been done with similar British wagons already in France, or whether it will be neoeseary to negotiate with the French Government for the acoeptanoe of private-owned w&amp;gonri without altered buffers and doup-llngs.I have not so far considered the financial terms under which wagons could be supplied for the benefit of Italy, and that matter will require consideration.(Intd.)

2 bKAHSLATIQH. Enclosure to minute by General Nash-        &quot; sssgO^erggCTrJuly,&apos; i$ia.&quot;HOTS OH THIS POSITION Of ROLLING STOCE IN ITALY.On the 1st July 1914 the Italian Hallways possessed 102,779 Wagons and 5305 locomotives.Iiurihg the course of It 13-1014 an average of 14,566 wogens has been employed daily in the transport of 41r4i21,872 tons of goeds. -  The distance in goods train tans, was 45,53^,788.    The total distance cowered by goods and passes gers was in the same period 118,355,776 train kms.The construction and purchase of  oiling stock has been effected during the war only with very great difficulty. Of the 3,000 wagons ordered in America, only 2,700 have arrived in Italy;   in addition it has been possible to construct 6,168 wagons in Italian workshops.Taking into account wagons repaired during the war, the present stock of wagons possessed by the Italian Bailways is about 109,000.    This last figure is composed as follows:-9,500 wagons immobilised for repair, 5,700    &quot;      on secondary railway lines, 19,000    &quot;      in circulation upon foreign&apos; lines, 4,800    &quot;      at the disposition of the MilitaryAuthorities for special services,other than the carriage of goods. 3,000    &quot;      at the disposition of the Managementof the State Kailways for its ownservices.There remain then 67,000 wagons available for military and public transportsOn the 30th June last 33,000&apos; foreign wagons wore in circulation on the State Lines and 2^000 on the Secondary Railways.     But hy reason of the existing agreements which compelled the Management to return foreign wagons promptly the effective number of these available is reduced to 18,000 only.    There remain -then, at present, 87,000 wagons available en the State Lines.During tho month of June in consequence of oircumfc stanoos exceptionally favourable to rnpidative circulation it has been possible to make use of 353,000 wagons with a daily average of 12,830 wagons loaded;   the goods carried amounted to 3,653,000 tons, or 10.80 tons per wagon loaded.Of the 12,830 wagons used daily, 8,000, or 64$ have been employed for transport purposes having a military character or purpose;   consequently in spite of the favour-able circumstances which have made it possible to reach the daily average above mentioned (which had been from 11,000 to 12,000 wagons in the preceding months) only 4,800 wagons per day could be put at the disposition of the Public:    One must include in this number the&apos;wagons employed for the transport of coal coming from Prance and from England, and those allotted for the transport of native fuels:    These latter, by reason of their very lew yield (?Calorifio PowerJ require in comparison with fcdttt a much greater amount of Boiling Stock.
The result has been that the Public Services have been very greatly reduced, and that the Ports have been served only In a very incomplete manner.,    Similarly the demands relating tfc the transport of native fuel were able to be satisfied only, in a very limited degree.It ie necessary to note that the number of 12,830 wagona loaded per day on the average during the month of June was able to be reached owing aleo to the presence on the Italian System in this same period of about 11,000 French wagons, which were able to be freely used during the Austrian Offen-eive for Military and Civil transports.The experience of the month of June has, therefore, shewn us that in spite of the presence of the French wagons, the transports were able to be effected upon thcltalian network only to a quite inadequate degree; a state of thingB which could not be attributed solely to an exceptional inten-sity of Military transports, since the latter have required during the month of June only an average of 8,000 wagons perl day against 7,500 during the preceding months.The attached table indicates the monthly progression of military traffic.But, on account of the agreement arrived at in London on the 13th March last, the Etat railway has been obliged to expedite the return .of French wagons in Italy in order to reduce the excess to the figure of ?G00 as fixed by the above agreement.    This return of wagons was tc be effected in the shortest possible time.The result of the efforts.made in this matter has been to reduce on the 15th irtsi: to about 6,600 wagons the excess number of French wagona in Italy.It is, however,, expedient that the measures taken to return the French Wagons in- the shortest possible -Lime and the strict instructions given that these wagonr shoulu only be used in Italy on the return journey have caused a narked diminution in the number of wagons available, and have made the situation worse.Other circumstances will shortly arise which will con-sider ably aggravate the transportation situation.     It is anticipated that the beetroot crop will shortly require the use of 3,500 wagons likewise the transport of cereals, winesi and reserve supplies of provisions for the Winter will necessitate the use of a large number of wagons.It is slearly evident, therefore^ that without efficac-ious and immediate assistance the railway transportation oon-ditions in Italy will shortly become really critical, espee-ially as the wagons at present under construction in the Italian shops cannot improve the situation until a distant date on account of the difficulties experienced in obtaining raw materials and skilled labourMoreover it is necessary to provide for an ulterior development of military operations which without doubt will involve considerable railway traffic in troops and material, immobilising a very large number of wagons.    The result will be a further diminution in the amount of traffic reserved for war industries, civil supplies and for the port services.
In view of the circumstances mentioned above, It is clearly evident that the situation ia such that it cannot admit rf any delay in furnishing the assistance asked for, and that in order to avoid very serious consequences, even from the military point of view, this assistance should be furnished during the current month and in a3 large a measure as possible.Having regard to the particularly difficult situation respecting rolling stock that is, being experienced at the present time by the Allied nations, the Italian request is limited, for the present, to 10,000 wagons which should be transferred or lent by the French.   The same request was made to General Henderson in December 1917.French stock is preferred on account of the character!a-tics which it possesses more closely approximating the Italian stock and because it is considered that the use, upon the French systems of English and American stock, presents fever difficulties owin/a; to the existence of services for the upkeep and repair of this material.The 10,000 wagons asked for should be, as has been said, transferred or lent, so as to allow Italy to make use of them without any restriction.It v/ould moreover be desirable that the transport of coal coming from th&apos;e Atlantic ports and from French mines should be effected by French, English, American, or Belgian wagons. Italy pledging herself formally to the immediate restitution :Sf emp-ty wagons.   This measure should be effected at once whilst waiting for the placing at disposal of the 10,000 wagons asked for.This request for wagons naturally implies a corresponding increase in the means of traction available, say about  00 locomotives.   To attain this result the restitution of the 125 erected locomotives lent to France is asked for and a temporary transference of about 100 ether locomotives whilst waiting for delivery *f the engines at present under construction.Finally, in order to improve at short notice the transportation situation, in avoiding the crisis foreseen, it is necessary;(l)      That the transport of coal from France to Italy and from French mines to the Mediterranean ports be entirely effected with Allied wagons to the exclusion ef Italian wagons.(2)      That 10,000 wagons be transferred or lent to Italy in order that they may be used at once and without restrictions whilst waiting to receive from America 10,000 wagons, the order for which 3hould be sane-tioned as soon as possible.(3).      That the 125 locomotives erected and lent to France be returned to Italy,(4)      That 100 ether locomotives be transferred or lent to Italy..(5) That there be transferred or lent to Italy 200 refrigerator wagons and 50 tank wagons for the transport of mineral oils and petrol.
It is understood that the above demands are wholly exclusive of the programmeo for the supply of materials necesoary for the upkeep of the lines, and fcr the repair and new con-struction in Italy of the rolling stock.N.B,   In the event of an American Expeditionary Force being sent to Italy it would be necessary that the whole &apos;of the means of transport needed, for the service of theae troops should be furnished to Italy in addition to what has been asked for above.
