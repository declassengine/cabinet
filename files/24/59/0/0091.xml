Weather conditions were unfavourable for flying.   .On 22nd July bombs were dropped on two destroyers off Zeebrugge, but it is not known whether any damage was clone.On 24th July bombs were dropped on a trawler off Ostend, a direct hit being obtained, and the trawler appeared to be in a sinking condition.On 21st July five Allied machines carried out an attack on Cattaro, when bombs Mediter-were dropped in the vicinity of the submarine base, two exploding among the submarines. r*nean. Heavy anti-aircraft fire was experienced and enemy seaplanes attacked our machines, one of which has failed to return.On 23rd July six of our machines carried out a raid on Constantinople, the bombs dropped causing considerable damage to the aerodrome, Admiralty buildings and the dockyard.   All of our machines returned safely.On 24th July at noon three Allied machines carried out a further raid on Cattaro. One direct hit with a 112-lb. bomb was made on the stern of an Austrian battleship of the &quot; Erzlierzog Karl&quot; class, and seven 112-lb. bombs were dropped on the submarine quarters. Our machines were heavily attacked by enemy machines and anti-aircraft fire, but all returned safely.On 26th- July seven Allied machines from Otranto carried out a bombing raid on the Austrian headquarters at Kagozina, near the River Skumbi in Albania. The raid was very successful, several large fires being started and great quantities of stores destroyed. All our machines returned safely.(C1313) wt.50   8/18   H &amp; S
2Casualties.        On 23rd July the armed merchant cruiser &quot; Marmora &quot; was torpedoed and sunk 52 miles from the Fastnet, 10 men being lost.On the same clay the destroyer &quot; Vanity &quot; struck a mine 2 miles north-east of May Island, Firth of Forth. The vessel proceeded to Leith for repair, but one man was killed and one is missing.On 24th July the destroyer &quot; Pincher &quot; ran ashore off LancVs End and subsequently sank, 13 men being lost.Submarines operating.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week under review about 23 enemy submarines of a type which operates further afield than the North Sea were located. Amongst these were included three of the converted &quot; cruiser &quot; type, one outward bound and two working to the eastward of New York. The remaining large boats were operating chiefly in the northern approaches to the Irish Sea, in the western approaches to the English Channel and in the Bay of Biscay, and one submarine was working off the coast of Portugal. It is reported that an enemy submarine visited Tofte in the Faroe Islands early on the morning of the 24th instant, landing two persons, who embarked again later. The activity off the East Coast of England has been intensified during the week, as many as six submarines having been operating at the same time between Yarmouth and Holy Island. During the 24 hours ending 10 a.m. on the 27th instant the unusually large number of 47 submarine reports were received from all areas.. .

362The Table in Appendix I shows the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of losses Losses of by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of all merchant steamships, .both British and Foreign, of over 500 tons gross register, and the Table in Appendix II g^nS? is a summary of those percentages for recent weeks. &apos; in Trades.The tonnage which arrived at or left United Kingdom ports during the week&apos; under review shows a slight reduction on the figures for the previous week, and the losses are very much less. The percentage of losses to sailings of such vessels engaged in Overseas trades is -74 as against 3-12 last week,&apos;in Cross-Channel trades is -34 as against -26, and in Coasting trades is -14 as against -11, while reckoning all United Kingdom trades together the percentage is -43 as against 1 -25 in the previous week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels Foreign as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas.Notwithstanding the large number of submarines operating during the week under review, the number of attacks made were fewer in all areas excepting on the American coast and in the North Sea. Very few attacks are reported in Home Waters other than the North Sea, but in that area great activity prevailed, 11 attacks having been made which resulted in the sinking of eight ships and damage to the remaining three.The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised Convoy Vessels Which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such convoyed. Convoys, compared with corresponding figures for previous periods, are as follows : Areas in which vessels lost.

The losses in the Mediterranean were one in the Bizerta-Alexandria Convoy, and two in the Gibraltar-Genoa Convoy.The enemy attacks made upon steamships of all nationalities of over 500 tons gross Enemy during each of the first six months of 1918, classified as to the result of the attack, and the attacks in percentage of vessels sunk, damaged and escaped in each of the completed quarters of 1918the year, are shown in the following Table :  classified asto result.Month.

ENEMY MINES.Minelaying. During the week under review enemy minelaying activity in Home Waters has been entirely concentrated in and to seaward of the Firth of Forth. All the mines swept up during the week were off the East Coast of Scotland, excepting two which formed part of an old minefield at Havre through which an approach route is now being cleared as the tide admits.Casualties. The following Table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels sunk by mine in Home Waters (including the Havre and Cherbourg areas) in recent weeks:-Week Ended.

No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.
FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.The s.s. &quot; Athena&quot; left Novorossisk on 25th July for Constanza with 1,000 German and 500 Turkish released prisoners of war. It is reported that Georgians have occupied Tuapse and that Cossacks have occupied Ekaterinodar and also Yeisk, whence the Bolsheviks have retired and withdrawn five vessels to Mariopol (Sea of Azov), where they have joined three German vessels.Recent reports indicate that the situation in Baku is critical, and depends largely on the attitude of the Caspian fleet, the officers of which are nominally Bolshevik. In Baku the Bolsheviks are undoubtedly in enemy pay, and enemy propaganda is extremely active.The gunboat flotilla on the River -Amur is reported to be under the command of German officers.Greece.The Greek destroyer &quot; Leon,&quot; when on patrol duty off Gallipoli on 27th July, clis-covered and rescued the pilot and observer of a British seaplane which had been adrift for eight hours in the Gulf of Xeros. The rescue was carried out while under fire from Turkish batteries at a distance of 7,000 yards.Spain.In an article which recently appeared in the Spanish paper &quot; La Accion,&quot; Sub-Lieut. Mateo Mille, of the Spanish Submarine Service, suggests that Spain should purchase and commission the four German submarines now interned in Spanish harbours, as the Dutch have done in the case of submarines interned in Holland. The Spanish Submarine Service is very small, consisting of only four submarines, but the officers are up-to-date and keen, and should the above suggestion be adopted a valuable addition would be made to the Navy.Naval Staff.1st August, 1918.[Appendices.
