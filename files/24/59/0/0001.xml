Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to(Previous papers ;- G.T. 4805, G.T. 4998, G.T. 5023, G.T, 6077 and G.T. 5078).I have been desired by Mr. Churchill to state the view of the Ministry of Munitions on the memorandum by the Minister of Labour in G.T. 4805, requiring that the Government Contract-ing Departments should oxclude from the list of approved con-tractors firms which have &quot;been shown to the satisfaction of the Departments concerned not to observe the principles of the Pair Wages Resolution as regards rates of wages or hours of labour in respect of either Government work or private work.&apos; Many advantages might be claimed for the Minister of Labour&apos;s proposal in times of peace, but the war has created abnormal conditions.   There is no free market for the Govern-ment, which is the principal buyer.   The wages for munitions work are fixed with regard to the necessity of maintaining production rather than the economic condition of the industry.. Contractors obtain reimbursement ftor compulsory advances paid on munitions work, but they could not be reimbursed for similar advances on private work.   If the Minister of Labours proposal were adopted, the high rates at present paid on munitions work would inevitably be regarded as the standard for a fair wage on private work.    These rates the employers on private work would be unable to pay without reimbursement.from the point of view of production one of two oonse-quences would follow, both of them undesirable.  Jirms doing a large proportion of Government work would oease to tender for Government contracts rather than pay the bulk of their work-people the high rates involved.   On the other hand, firms doing a largo proportion of munitions work would continue to do that work, but would load the prices of their Government contracts, with the additional wage expenses which they were oompelled to in^ur, on private work, and the State having no alternative producer, would find it almost impossible to resist these pay-ments.   In either oase the State would be the loser, for it would lose the production of the first class of firm, and would have to pay more for the products of the second.The payment on private work of wages as high as those which are paid on munitions workftoulft remove the economic in-duoement to labour to leave private work for munitions work. The present differential rates of wages have the advantage of attracting labour from less essential to more essential work. Munitions production has been assisted by this tendency, and would be prejudiced if it were to oease.It might be necessary for the State to face these die-advantages if labour engaged on private work had any sufficient grievance to make the change necessary on grounds of policy, but* in fact, it is diffi-sult to-&apos; establish any such grievance.   The present practice of the Departments, on the whole, prevents the placing of contracts with unfair firms; but to establish a cast-iron system, under which an enployer must pay munitions rates on every- contract, even though the contract is for a private purpose would be unreasonable and unfair to the State.WAR   CABINET.

27The high wages paid to munition workers art aooomp&amp;nied by eertain sacrifices on the side of labour.   The workman giro a u* the right to strike; fcs is net ajlewe^ to mote outside the range of munitions work; and. in the case of oontrolled estab*-liahmcnts. ho is compelled to suspend all customs restrictive either of employment or production.   It is true that in practice these restrictions on the long oherisfctd rights of labour cannot be everywhere and at all times enforcedt tot broadly speaking, the limitations are effective.  Labour engaged on private work makes no such sacrifices, and I see no Justification for oonferrinc on such labour the privileges of munition workers without their liabilities.It must be remembered that fow wtfltpeople are compelled to remain on private work if they dislike its conditions.   There Is an ample market for their services on munitions work, where they can obtain the high rates of wages incidental to such work, and the public interest requires that there should be some incentive to engage on munitions work rather, than to remain on private work.Different considerations arise if the proposal of the Minister of Labour is regarded as an instrument for use after the war.   Suoh an amendment as is proposed would be of great value in securing that tho improvement in labour conditions, which has resulted from the war, is continued when the abnormal conditions of production for war purposes has disappeared; but even here I wuld make the qualifications that the proposal should form part of a general Government Wages Policy, which X am coxrrineed must be faced as one of the first necessities of the political Situation immediately.on the termination of hostilities.(8g&amp;.)   7.
