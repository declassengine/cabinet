COMMITTEE had under consideration a copy of Minutes from Eajop-General Sir P.A.M.&apos;.Nash to the Director General of Movements and Railways on the subject of the Wagon Pcsition in Italy (G.T.5208).GENERAL NASH explained that there was a very grave shortage of wagons in prance.which had been accentuated Toy the imports of the American Army.   In Italy the situation was also &quot;bad, and General Hash referred ike Committee to the diagram attached to G.T.5208, Whion showed that there had &quot;been a continuous rise sinoe 1915 in the   number of wagons used for military purposes. This rise had &quot;been mot &quot;by a reduction in the number of wagons used for private and commercial purposes, and whereas the Italians usod to depend On 12,000 wagons a day for these purposes, only 4,500 were now available.      The Italians had, until recently, the use ef from 10,000 to 13,000 Prenoh wagons but the prench had requested their return - about 7,000 of these wagons had bean returned and tho Italians were now unable to meet their Military requirements.    Tho Italians had appealed for assistance and had made three alternative proposals;-
-   0   m(1)   That the French Mp*olM of wagons should provide for the conveyance by rail of all coal at present sent by that means t* Italy;   This would , be equivalent to asking for about 13,000 wagons,,(2)   That the tfrentih &quot;pool&quot; should lend 10,000 wagons to Italy.(3)   That 10,000 shtuld be constructed in America for Italy,GENERAL HASH said.that, in the -fpinitn of the . interallied Transportation Council, there ishould be n* weakening *f the number of wagons in yrance, all being required for Allied use there, and that Italy should not place an order in America as America would herself require 100,000 wagons for her Army in France.    These proposals being impracticable, General Hash suggested that there were only two ways of meeting Italy1ft demandj*(1)   By carrying the-coal now carried by rail by sea - This would give back to Italy 4,000 to 5,-000 wagons i(2) .By sending wagone from British Railways - 20,000 being necessary,GEHERA1 NASH urged that assistance was necessary and that the wagons were urgently required during the next few months.THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER said that the first proposal of General ftash was impracticable, hot only beoause of the serious losses from the Submarine Menace in the&apos; Mediterranean, but the tonnage was hit available, He suggest eft&apos;.&apos;ifeet the course to adopt would be to send 10,000 wagons from this country *    There were, he &quot;believed^ 1,400&apos;,000 wagons in title country and taking into consideration tho reduced output of cool he was&quot; convinced there must be considerable possibilities.   Sir Joseph Maclay regretted that the wagons here had not all been pooled long agts.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE stated that most careful consideration had been given to the question of peeling privately owned wagons,, but both he, Sir H* Walker and Sir Guy Calthxop had come to the conclusion it was impossible during the war.   In the first place, about half of the wagons in the country were privately owned and the organization required to control thorn WQUld be enormous.   In the second place the remits to these wagons presented an insuperable difficulty.   A great many private wagons had been ta&amp;en over.   With regard to the proposals to transfer 10,000 wagons to Italy, Sir Albert&apos; Stanley said that the railways had been working so quietly and efficiently in spite cf a limited staff and difficulties with regard te rolling stock, that it was n*t realized that there wajj nothing to spare.   The Board *  Trade was prepared to make sacrifices, but the amount efpresent discomfort was no criterion as to what would happen next winter.   Even if coal were prwduced, in sufficient quantity,, it would not be possible ts distribute it so that all parts of the country should have a fair share.SIR HERBERT WALKER
0 -tt wSIR HERBERT TALKER endorsed Sir Albert F3tanley*s remarks as to the difficulty of pooling privately owned wagons in this country.   He agreed that the present system was most wasteful, but pointed out that the question of repairs alone rendered any general pooling of wagons impossible.   While it would be quite possible to commandeer a number of the privately owned wagons, it would be impossible to sand any of them abroad as they would be out of repair in two months with no means of repairing them.    The only alternative was to send wagons from the railway supplies and for the Railway Companies to take *ver a corresponding number of private wagons but this would affect the position in the Winter.questioned as to the urgency of the matter, GENERAL NASH said that it was very urgent.   Italy was reduced to about 4,000 wagons a dsy to most all the requirements of her industrial and civil populatian. He was quite convinced that France could not help. Ameritfawas now discharging 32,000 tons a day at the ports, and the estimated figure for December was 50,000 tons a day and for May 100,000 tons a day. General   &apos;iash pointed cut that while these figures appeared very large compared with the British figure Yrtuch was now about 22,000 tons a day, it must be remembered that ^America was accumulating reserves of supplies, bringing material for building p*rts, railways, depots and hospitals,     The British Army now used 47,000 wagons a day but in December, owing to a longer rail, the Americans would be using 130,000 of-which they had 40,000.     Consequently the other QOvOOO would have to be found by France.      Te sum up&apos;&apos;the Italians will not be able to ddstribuie food and France cannot help them,THE PRIIffi CTISTER said that, this was a very important question.   It was undoubtedly necessary tC find the wagons somewhere and it seemed that it was only passible to provide them from British eourcde.   Mr. Lloyd George said that he desired to place on record the appreciation of the government for all the w*rk the   Railway companies had done and how they had always responded when appealed to, more particularly when there was a great shortage of roiling &apos; stock: in France,   He suggested that a Conference composed of the Departments concerned should be held with a view to agreeing on some method by whioh the wagons required could be provided from. British sources *THE COHKJTOS decided that :-The President of the Board of Trade should convene a Conference composed of the Shipping Controller, Sir Guy Calthrcp, Sir H.A. Walter, Sir Ssm Fay, and a representative of the Ministry ef Munitions to agr-es-if passible on the method by which 10,000 railway wagons could be supplied from British sources for Italy.SIR JOSEPH. MACLAX&quot; called the attention of the Ctmmittee to the very serious situation in this country with regard to the production of coal.    V/e were falling short by 1 million tons per month of the total amount required for export.   The immediateresult
result of this was shewn in the fact that no less than 87 ships were at the present moment delayed waiting for cargoes and it was necessary to send Bhips away in ballast for lack of coal.SIR GUY CALTHROP said that the fault was not entirely due to the miners as no class had suffered more from the epidemic of influenza than miners had.   In one South Wales Colliery bO% had been incapacitated from this cause.MR, LLOYD GEORGE said that he was disappointed to find that when the reo-ent increase of wages to miners was announced it had not been accompanied by a statement to the effect that this increase was given on oondition that the men pledged themselves to put forward their best efforts.SIR BUY CALTHROP explained that the miners had a new Executive and that a new manifesto was being issued next week in which it would be stated that a pledge to that effect had been given and that it rested with the miners to carry it out,Whitehall Gardens, S.W, 25th July, 1918.
