Italian fronts.Lord MilnerTs Memorandum suggests that the ration strength of the British Army as set out in the above-mentioned table included Military labour - White, Coloured and Alien, with Prisoners of War, the counterpart of which is not borne on the ration strength of the French Army.       If this is so, &quot;ration strength&quot; in the table of Appendix II. of the National Service Department Memor-andum does not mean the same thing in the case of the several belligerents whose forces are there compared.Lord Milner further refers to the amount of labour employed in Docks and Railways for Transportation purposes which is necessitated by the fact that the British Army is operating in a foreign country, and it is suggested that it would be fair in order to institute a correct comparison with German and French figures; that a total of 300,000 B&amp;gfat be deducted from what is stated to bethe British ration strength.      Accurate information on this point obviously governs the whole case and the &quot;extent to which such subordinate or labour services was included in the French return would require to be determined in drawing any just conclusion from the figures.       1 say &quot;French5&apos;, because it would obviously be more difficult/
154difficult to obtain comparable figures with regard to the German Army.It would, I suggest,&quot;be of great importance that, in discussing these vital matters,&apos; we should have figures which arc as strictly as possible comparable with one another.I gather from the concluding paragraphs of Lord Milner&apos;s Memorandum that, without interfering with the most necessary work )f those who have our future war plans under consideration, it flight not be unacceptable to have a small Standing Committee appointed which would be competent&quot;to review the frame-work of our Expeditionary Forces&quot; and upon which Headquarters would, of course,line War Cabinet, it appears to me that it would be a very useful Istep to take as arising out of the considerations advanced in the Memoranda referred to in this Note.Should this suggestion commend itself toC, ADDISON.26th July 1918.
