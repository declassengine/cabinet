eport relating to the War Work of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland for the week ending 24th July 1918.FOOD PRODUCTION..During the week the temperature lias been high, and a good deal of rain has fallen.    On the night of the 17th a violent thunderstorm took place, accompanied by heavy rain, and on the 20th and 81st rain fell continuously for about 18 hours, with a fairly strong west wind, which resulted in some districts in the twisting and laying of the grain crops. On the whole however the rain has proved very beneficial to the growing crops, and progress has been made with the hay harvest during the dry periods.1. Tree tor a and Agricultural Machinery,A number of the Board&apos;s tractors have been used during the past nonth by farmers for ploughing hay stubble- land and, where turnips; had not been successful for preparing land for the cowing down of rape or other catch crop where it was considered more profitable to do this than to re-sow turnips. The majority of the tractors, ko^e-ver, are now undergoing repairs so that they may be in readiness for harvest operations.There haw been some a-cplications for the use of traotors with mowing machines for. mowing hay.     In several districts these operations have been successfully carried out with the aid of tractors.2*    Employment of Prisoners of War.District Agricultural Executive Committees have been notified by circular that the Military Authorities are prepared to allow prisoners of war to be employed on farnJ under certain conditions, and have been asked to consider whether it will be possible to adopt either or both of the following schemes for their districts:-(A) Prisoners of War in groups of from 25 to 50 to be stationed at suitable centres and sent out in gangs of four or five to farms within three miles cf the centre.(B) Individual prisoners of war, not exceeding three in each case, to be employed by and in the charge of farmers (on the reoommendation of the Agricultural Executive Committee) as in the oase of ordinary farm workers.The Board have impressed upon the Committees the necessity for taking advantage of all forms of labour that can be made available so as to ensure that no part of the crop may be lost and the importance of considering without delay the employment of this form of labour.3-    Hallway Rates for &quot;wintsrJnyJLa^he-an.The attention of the Board was recently directed to the changed which the Scottish Railway Companies propose to make in the rates for the conveyance of cheep &apos;fce and from their wintering quarters.     The TjoarC approached the Railway Executive Committee on the subject pointing out that any large increase in the existing charges wae unCesirable in view of the need for maintaining the sheep stocks of the country and the steps that were being taken to increase the number of sheep kept in  /
8.-i&apos;.. XIn oertain areas.    The Committee suggested that the Board should meet representatives of the Railway Companies and disouss the matter and accordingly, a conference was arranged with the Goods Managers of the North British, Caledonian and Glasgow and South Western Railway Companies.    A large Sheep Farmer in the South of Scotland at whose instanoe the Board took the matter up with the Railway Executive Committee was also present.The representatives of the Railway Companies explained -(1)   that hitherto sheep were conveyed to their wintering quarters at the rate of 6d. per truck per mile.(2)   that no charge was made for bringing the sheep back at the end of the season.(3)   that owing to the increased bulk of the sheep at the end of the season one additional waggon in four was allowed.(4)   that the minimum consignment that oould be accepted on these terms was three waggons.The proposed new rates are as follows(1)   the sheep will be taken to their wintering quarters at ordinary rates.(2)   the sheep will be returned at half rates and no additional charge will be made for extra waggons.(Z)   the minimum consignment of three waggons will not be insisted upon.The net effect of the new rates will be that farmers will have to pay on the average about 3d. per head extra on the double journey for the railing of &quot;wintering&quot; sheep.   The representatives of the Railway Companies contended that in present circumstances this additional charge was not excessive and ^   the Board do not think that this contention can be seriously disputed.   The sheep farmer present at the Conference intimated that he was satisfied with the explanation that had been given.4.   Rationing of poultry;..The Ministry of Food have allocated a oertain quantity of feeding Btuffs for the maintenance of the best stocks of utility poultry in the country and a definite quota, which has not yet been fixed, vdll be assigned to Sootland.   The distribu-:tion will be made through a Sub-Committee of the Poet Feeding Stuffs Committee of which a member of the Board:s staff will be Chairman.   This body will be assisted in its work by Provincial Committees to be set up in each of the 3even areas into which Scotland has been divided by the Ministry of Food for the general allocation of feeding stufifs for all live stock,   $he members of these Provincial Committees are to be nominated by the Agricultural Colleges in consultation with the Board.The scheme was discussed at a Conferenoe held on the 22nd instant between representatives of the Colleges and the Board. The Colleges have undertaken to submit their nominations at an early date and it is hoped that the machinery for the distribution of /
112-3-of the feeding stuffs will soon be completed and in operation.5.    Inspection of Growing Props of Immune Varieties.Arrangements for the inspection and certification of crops of immune varieties have now been completed.    The Board have engaged temporarily 12 additional inspectors for this work and although a large acreage will require to be covered it is hoped that all the crops in respect of which applications have been received will be inspected before the end of August. Inspections were carried out during the week in Wigtownshire, but the work will be in hand generally throughout the potato growing districts within the nert few days.FORESTRY.Employment of Schoolboys.Arrangements have been made for the establishment of 22 Forestry Camps entailing the employment of 700 boys (including oommandants).    Of these, 185 were employed during the Easter vacation and the remainder (with the exception of one party of 24) are at present at work.In addition the Board have assisted in placing about 40 College Students and Schoolboys separately or in small groups upon individual estates.Arrangements sra in hand to form a camp of about 40 medical and other students for forestry work in the autumn.The work upon which the boys arc engaged this year is mainly clearing and burning of felled areas.
