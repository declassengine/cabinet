jThis Document is the Property of     &amp;   Si a ft nHJLM^MaJestfs Government.. ^31st July, 1918.^     IfesMBIT RELATIVE TO EXCHANGE 0? PRISONERS OF WAR. J^/Jt &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.,With reference to the discussion which took place at the meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet yesterday, the 50th instant, I think it desirable to place on record the emphatic Admiralty opinion that from a Naval point of view the agreement signed by the Delegates of the British and German Governments at The Hague on the 14th July should not be ratified by the British Government until the instructions given to the British Delegates by the War Cabinet that German submarine prisoners of war who are interned in Holland and Switzerland are not to be repatriated, are given effect to therein.It will be within the recollection of the War Cabinet that the Admiralty have from the very first been strongly opposed to any agreement being arrived at which would involve the release or repatriation of any submarine officers and men,, and a reference to War Cabinet 419, Minute 10, indicates that the War Cabinet were seized with the views of the Admiralty upon this point, Such was the importance that the Admiralty attached to this question that the Cabinet were urged (Memorandum dated 3rd June) to include amongst the &quot;Delegates a Naval representative.    The War Cabinet, however, did not agree to this suggestion but decided (War Cabinet 425, Minute 18) that Admiralty representatives should accompany the Delegation, and Captain H. K. Kitson accordingly did  -so.    It was made clear by this Minute that the Admiralty would have/&apos; an opportunity of expressing to the War Cabinet direct any objections that they might have to the agreement, inasmuch as no such agreement would be concluded without the War Cabinet first considering the sameAgain, at &amp; later date (5th June), both I and the First Sea Lord urged upon the War Cabinet the importance of excluding from the scope of the matters to come under discussion by the Delegates of the two Governments any question of the release of German submarine/prisoners/
228prisoners now in this Country, and the War Cabinet decidedthat day (War Cabinet426 Minute 4) that an agreement should ,HQ.t.3ediscussed for the exchange of submarine prisoners.This decision was reiterated on the 8th July in atelegram sent by the direction of the War Cabinet to the BritishDelegates at The Hague in the following terms&quot;Sir George Cave&apos;s views in telegram 1622 are approved, it being understood that officers and crews of submarines are in no case to be repatriated. r&quot;It now appears that the words necessary to secure theexclusion of officers and erews of German submarines now internedin Holland and Switzerland from the scope of the agreement havebeen omitted from Article 2,.and it follows that if the necessaryclause which the Home Secretary explained had, bv a Printer1serror, been dropped out, is not reinstated, the enemy willbe entitled, under the terms of the agreement, to utilisethe German submarine officers, 19 of whom are interned inHolland and 5 in Switzerland ( and 46 Petty Officers ),for the purpose of their submarine service for any purposeonlywhatever, so long/as they do not use them in any employment afloat or ashore in which they might be actively engaged with the enemies of Germany.In fairness to Captain Kitson it should be stated that he was in no way responsible for this grievous omission in Article 2 of the agreement, as he left Holland with Sir George Cave on July 6th in order to attend to important questions of transportation which arose in the course of the discussions held by the Delegates, relying upon the Delegates following explicitly the Instructions so clearly given to them by His Majesty&apos;s Government and reiterated thereafter in the telegram to the British Delegates on 8th July quoted atsove.
rW W wThe gravity of the situation created by the omission of this clause can hardly bo overstated.   In carrying on their submarino warfare, tho greatest difficulty with which tho enemy is faced is the shortage of trained submarine officers and crows, Not only would the repatriation of these 34 officers and 46 Potty Officers bo of immense value to tho enemy for the purpose of training their submarine personnel and instructing them in tho art of submarine warfare9 but, with tho knowledge which wo possess of tho Gorman nature and characteristics, it is submittod that no reliance whatever can bo placed upon their conforming to the letter and spirit oftho agreement that these officers and men shall not be employed afloat or ashore in a capacity in which they might bo actively engaged with their enemies0To Illustrate the Importance to tho enemy of obtaining the repatriation cf trained submarine personnel, it may be stated that one officer, who is now interned in Holland, is reputed to have sunk during two cruises, in two periods of not mere than one week oaclu no 2 ?ss than SO vessels, and one officer captured at a later date is reported to have well over 200j000 tons of shipping to his credit.The inestimable value to the enemy cf regaining the services of this trained personnel must be apparent, and in the Naval view their release would be equal to a substantial, accretion of their submarine forces.  What loss of British tonnage would bo involved by such an accretion cannot, of course, be computed with accuracy, but that it would be very large is undeniable, and this even though the officers and men released are not themselves directly engaged in submarine operations but aro employed in the training of loss experienced personnel.   The effect upon the tonnage and interest of our Allies - particularlytho United States - of the release of German submarine personnel is also a most serious matter which should not be lost sight of.The.,.,
230The inclusion of Submarine Officers and men in this agroerao3.it will make it most difficult to exclude thorn from future agreements/not only of ourselves but of our Allies also, and it cannot he too clearly understood that tho value of theme highly trained officers and Potty Officer?.; originally captured together with those men of the same calibre and training whom wo capture from time to time, is immeasurably greater than is the value of the loss highly trained officers ana crows.  From a Naval point of view this mistake is one which, if not rectified, will have most serious results.For the foregoing reasons, I most strongly urge that the reinstatement of the clause which has boon omitted from Article 2 should be insisted upon, and I desire that the War Cabinet should appreciate the consequences that will ensue if the demand for reinstatement of this clause is not successful.(Signed) Eric Goddes.31st July, 1918,
