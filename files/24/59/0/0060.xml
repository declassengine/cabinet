It should be stated in the House of Lords also that Tilak had accepted similar conditions and was coming to England for the purpose of conducting his case.     He has announced his intention of approaching the Rome Government for the modification or cancellation of the conditions on arrival in England.      The Cabinet have therefore postponed consideration of his case until his arrival in England and his approaching them.Yours sincerely,(Sd.) E. Montagu.C K IT,Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey, K*CB.
