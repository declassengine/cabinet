The dispute on the ground of the embargo has resulted in a stoppage after the week under report. A victimisation case on the Tyne also threatens to cause a stoppage.I.-General Remarks.The Trouble about the Embargo.The agitation which has resulted in the present serious industrial position may be said to have commenced at the beginning of June, and to have had reference until quite a recent date to the new arrangements in connection with the War, Munition Volunteers Scheme rather than to the arrangements for prevention of increase in skilled staff in the case of the larger firms except under licence. It is noticeable that though the first report of unrest in connection with the War Munition Volunteers Scheme is dated the 8th June (the very date on which the press announcement with regard to the embargo system was made), the first indication of trouble in connection with this latter system was at Birmingham on the 15th July. Between these two dates the War Munition Volunteers Scheme had received very widespread attention throughout the country, and a large number of resolutions had been passed in its condemnation. Of these the earliest was that of the London District Committee of Carpenters and Joiners, who advised its members to refuse to engage as War Munition Volunteers on the ground that the system amounted to industrial conscription. Opposition to the scheme appears at that period to have been strengthened by the with-[1100-39] B
drawal of the concession of cheap week-end tickets for War Munition Volunteers, complaints on the subject having been reported from London on the 8th June and from Woolwich on the 19th. The position was further aggravated by the unfortunate Ponders&apos; End incident. On the 21st June the Barrow shop stewards met to consider that occurrence, and a strong letter was read denouncing as industrial conscription the compulsory return of the men who had travelled from Barrow to ponders&apos; End in the hope of obtaining work there. That agitation continued until the 9th July. The shop stewards at Barrow then met the local representative of the Ministry of Munitions, and the matter was settled by travelling expenses being paid to the returned men. This was the first case of the working of the embargo, which brought its existence and methods forcibly home to the men. Meanwhile the agitation with regard to the War Munition Volunteers continued and caused trouble at Coventry, at Barrow, at Woolwich, at Chepstow, and elsewhere. Gradually, however, the agitation as to the embargo eclipsed that surrounding the War Munition Volunteers Scheme. On the loth July Birmingham reported trouble about the embargo, oil the 16th the Manchester Joint Engineering Shop Stewards&apos; Committee resolved that its members should refuse to instruct or assist diluted labour until the embargo was removed, and on the 17th it was reported from Coventry that complaints were made that the embargo prevented re-employment of men who had left particular firms. On the 19th information was received from Manchester that the engineers were unanimous in their demand that the embargo should be removed, and, as they believed that the country possesses only one month&apos;s reserve of (ammunition, they felt certain that the agitators could not but succeed in compelling the cancellation of the orders. On the 20th Coventry passed a resolution refusing to withdraw strike notices until the embargo was removed, and on the same day the engineers at Leeds were reported to be seriously disturbed, and to have been advised that a general strike might be called. On the same date it was reported from Barrow that both official and shop steward organisations agreed to support Coventry in any action it might take on the question of the embargo. Latest reports are to the effect that in Coventry, notwithstanding the resolution of the Joint Committee that the matter should be referred to the National Engineering Allied Trades Committee, at a meeting to be held in Leeds on the 25th, 12,000 members of the A.S.E. and of the toolmakers are out, that Birmingham has decided to cease work to-day, that the A.S.E. at Manchester has unanimously resolved to follow suit, and that Lincoln will come out on the 24th.The industrial objections both to the War Munition Volunteers Scheme and to the embargo scheme are obvious and potent. The former measure introduces unquestionably a modified form of industrial conscription, and it would probably have been better if this had been frankly stated. It is impossible to prevent realisation by the men that the measure places them in a position in which they are bound to work wherever the Government concludes that their services would be most valuable, though upon favour-able terms in respect of wages.A further objection to the embargo lies in its special application to the skilled workman, who is thereby prevented from selling his labour in the highest market, whereas the unskilled man is in the nature of things exempt from this disability. It will be remembered that recognition of the comparatively unfavourable situation of the skilled men resulted in the special provision for the 121- Per cen^ advance to workmen of these classes, but it is also a matter of history that the rectification of the comparative positions of the skilled and unskilled which this measure was designed to secure did not in fact result. The skilled men naturally wish to sell their services to the highest bidder, and the emploj^ers. are ready to bid against each other regardless of the national interest, in order to get together a strong nucleus of skilled men for after-war purposes. &apos; As the offensive notice placarded by certain Coventry firms proves, there is collusion between employers and men in certain cases to resist the embargo.There are, however, in addition, psychological reasons which intensify, the opposition to the scheme. Organised labour is now intensely suspicious of any measures adopted by the Government to interfere with the normal industrial position. It is therefore unfortunate, that at the time of the introduction of these special measures steps were not taken to convince organised labour of the firm and continued intentions of the Government to introduce an adequate measure ensuring the restoration of trade union customs and conditions at the close of the war. The men are also under the impression, that the prucedure hitherto observed in accordance withlwhich matters of serious import have only been decided after meticulous consultation with the unions concerned, has been neglected in the present instance. They do not consider that the approval of the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the general principles adopted by
3the,Government is sufficient justification for the belief that those principles, much less the principles devised for their application, are acceptable to the unions as a whole.The schemes were first mooted when the country was profoundly impressed by the successful German offensive of the 21st to 28th March, when it was obvious that the numbers of the existing British army in France were insufficient for defensive, and still more insufficient for offensive, purposes, and when anxiety as to the military position and the safety of this country was intense.. Had action been taken at once the recommendations of the Trade Union Advisory Committee might have been accepted by organised labour throughout the country, and the embargo scheme might have gone through without serious opposition. Since that time, however, very great insistence-has been laid on the extraordinary numbers of American troops which have reached and are reaching xhe front. The Italian victory on the Piave and the more recent reverse to the Germans on the Marne have combined to allay the acute anxiety with which the position was regarded at the beginning of April, and to weaken the patriotic impulse which it stimulated. Although there are signs that the action of the A.S.E. and toolmakers of Coventry will not obtain the undivided support even of the shop stewards element in that centre, the fact is counterbalanced by the somewhat grave news that both official and the shop stewards&apos; parties in Barrow had determined to support Coventry by extreme measures. At the worst a strike of proportions even larger than those of May 1917 has to be faced. At best a strike cannot fail to attain proportions which will very seriously affect the turn-out of munitions. Unanimous resolutions were passed at Birmingham and Smethwick on Monday night in favour of ceasing work on Wednesday night unless the embargo was withdrawn. It is stated that 800 men at Kynoch&apos;s and a number of men at the B.S.A. works will come out this evening. At Woolwich the engineers are awaiting the decision of the National Conference. It is reported that the majority of workmen at Barrow do not favour a strike, but that the Coventry delegates have received offers of support at Newcastle, Derby, Liverpool, Manchester, London, and Southampton. Altogether the prospects appear to be in favour of a more or less general stoppage unless a settlement is reached.In estimating the probabilities there are certain aspects of the situation which require to be borne in mind. The first is that the strike so far as it has gone has been against the advice, not mere])7 of the executive of the A.S.E., but also of the Allied Trades Committee at Coventry, which was set up by the men themselves, and which represents the Shop Stewards Movement. From this it is clear that no sort of agreement with any body of representatives is likely to be regarded as binding by the rank and file in their present temper. &apos; The second is that the men are probably reckoning on two things : (a; that the stocks of munitions are so short as to place the Government at their mercy ; (6) that apart from this the Government will not dare to take a firm line. With (a) this department is not concerned, but as regards (b) it is probable that a firm front, together with a frank explanation of the facts, would considerably reduce the area of probable trouble. Thirdly, if the men were convinced that the Government meant to adhere to the principle of the embargo they might be prepared to accept a share in its local administration as a compromise, which would give both sides an exit out of the present impasse. But such a compromise would have to be conditional on recognition of the control of the Ministry of Munitions in the local committees. Ministry officials would require, not only to be members of the committees, but to have the power of veto. Another claim of the men could also be met, probably without serious danger, namely, greater publicity for the names of embargoed firms, to save men from tramping from firm to firm. Note.-The above was written before the meeting with the Trade Union AdvisoryCommittee on the 25th July.]II. Press Comments.Military.The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; writing before the French counter-attack had fully developed, attached little importance to Uheims as a strategical point. It recalls the fact that previous German attacks were developed in pairs, and thinks it likely that some pendant enterprise may develop with the present offensive. The prompt check given to this attack was mainly due to the elimination of the element of surprise.
Peace Negotiations.Count Hertling&apos;s speech has produced afresh flood of suggestions, and Mr. Bender-sons tour is accompanied by the approbation of the pacifist press. Only a few papers, hint at the need for caution. Thus the &quot; New Witness&quot; emphasises the distinction between German words and German deeds ; Mr. Fisher, in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; couples the name of Mr. Henderson with defeatism. On the other side, &quot; Common Sense,&quot; which is now the organ of the Lansdowne Party, looks forward to Mr. Henderson marshalling the forces of British Labour on the side of a negotiated peace. Mr. Snowden reviews in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; Count Hertling&apos;s speech, and says that his definite statement that Germany has no intention of keeping Belgium, in any form whatever, removes the cause for which the people of Great Britain were induced to support the war. He regrets that the speeches recently delivered by Colonial Ministers in this country afford ample justification for Count Hertlings reluctance to restore Belgium without an assurance that the British Government will abandon its military conquests. The &quot; Herald &quot; welcomes Lord Wimborne&apos;s speech in the House of Lords on the discussion of peace, and also Count Burians declaration that Austria is willing and anxious for peace.Aliens.Fresh condemnation of the alien agitation appears in the &quot; New Statesman&quot; and the &quot;Leicester Pioneer.&quot; The &quot; Clarion,&quot; however, thinks that the proposals made by Government do not go far enough, and will please the pro-Germans.The Internationale.The replies of the enemy Socialists have revived this topic. The &quot; Nation &quot; says that the Austrian assent is more than cordial: the Bulgarian document is an almost naive cry of delight that such a basis of unity has been found. The view of the German Minority was never in doubt. If we know that of the German Majority only in outline, the fault lies with our Foreign Office, which prevented M. Troelstra from informing us. The &quot; New Statesman&quot; thinks that the replies will not influence the Foreign Offices of the belligerents, and there is a bare chance that the Governments may be disposed to permit a carefully delimited International Socialist Congress in Switzerland before the winter sets in. In consequence of the new position the revival of the Internationale is strongly pressed by the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; and &quot; Herald.&quot; From a note by Mr. Hen-derson in the latter, it is clear that in his first speech he quoted only from a verbal account transmitted to him by M. Troelstra of the official reply of the German Majority Socialists conveyed by Schiedemann... He holds that the summary which reached him justified the statement that the Germans have taken a considerable step forward to meet the allied Socialists. . Summing up the position, the &quot;Labour Leader &quot; says that the voice of the workers has now been heard in every European country, demanding peace on the basis of international justice.Labour Politics.An attempt is made in the &quot; Herald&quot; to pave the way for reconciliation with the; section of trade unionists who desire to form a new party. While not objecting to the expression of sectional opinion within the parent association, it insists that the new party must work within the constitution of the Labour Party. All else is rank treason. A complaint appears in the &quot; Call &quot; that sufficient notice has not been given to the proposal of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress to develop an international trade union policy, confined to Labour in the allied countries, An article in the &quot; Co-operative News &quot; justifies the entry of co-operators info politics.Cotton Control Board.Both the &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Call &quot; criticise this Board, the former on the ground that Labour representation is not equal to that of the employers, aud the latter because the &quot; Rota &apos;; system was to be abolished.Miners. tThe &quot;Herald&quot; sees in the recent conference of the. Miners&apos; Federation a considerable ferment among the miners.   From the method in which the strike of
835aircraft workers was settled, it is convinced that the shop stewards movement is growing rapidly, and that powerful forces are at work underneath, which cannot be much longer ignored. &apos;Food.Mr. Hyndman in &quot;Justice&quot; regrets that he was unable to move a resolution deprecating the withdrawal of labour from agriculture at the last meeting of the Food Consumers&apos; Council. He approves of the proposal that the Government should take control of all imported fresh fruit, and in distributing it give preference to children, who are the most important element in the community. He complains of profiteering in the Saturday sales of fresh fruit and in the price of fresh vegetables.The &quot;Co-operative News&quot; still presses for rationing of jam, and for facilities for home manufacture. It hopes that local societies will discuss the question of collecting fruit for private manufacture or for the Wholesale Society&apos;s factory.III. District Eeports.London and South-Eastern.The situation in this area is fairly satisfactory, and little unrest is at present reported. Matters are, however, threatening on the subject of War Munition Volunteers, and a notice was issued throughout the workshops on the 16th by the West London Engineering Workers&apos; Committee condemning the Governments scheme. At Cubitt&apos;s, also, the tool-makers and the skilled men of the A.S.E. seem to be in favour of handing in notices upon this grievance in sympathy with Coventry.The London District Committee of the A.S.E. have instructed shop stewards and branches not to participate in the formation or working of Whitley Councils..At a meeting of sheet metal workers on the 12th, it was held that the decision upon the aircraft dispute was unsatisfactory, and an appeal was proposed, but no further action has been reported.A demand for an advance in wages is shortly to be made by the Electrical Trades&apos; Union. Some discontent exists among the woodworkers at Whitehead&apos;s over an increase of 3d. an hour said to have been promised last May.West Midlands.Very serious unrest has been occasioned in this area by the scheme for War Munition Volunteers, and more particularly the embargo placed on employment of skilled men by certain selected firms. On the 23rd July, in spite of an earlier decision to suspend notices which had been handed in, a strike began at Coventry over this question,   At Birmingham, also, the position is very seriously disturbed.Unrest is still evident at the Austin Motor Works, where resolutions were recently carried demanding the removal of the whole of the present managing staff, including Sir H. Austin, and refusing the reduced price offered for certain work. The trade union officials are said to favour the taking over of complete control by Government.Yorkshire and East Midlands.A considerable current of unrest runs throughout this district, though the strike of engineers in the textile trade ceased on the 22nd July.The embargo placed upon enlistment of skilled labour is strongly resented, more particularly in Leeds, Lincoln, and Sheffield.In Sheffield much unrest is also reported as regards dilution, which is claimed now to be used merely to release skilled men for the army, and the general attitude is illustrated by a strike of moulders, referred to in Part IV.Various unions in the textile trade have this week put in applications for increased wages, and in some cases the male workers anticipate large advances. The temper of the workpeople in this industry is at the moment so uncertain that an extensive strike is apprehended by the officials, should their hope be disappointed.A meeting of Midland hosiery manufacturers was held last week at Leicester, with the object of forming a Joint Industrial Council in the hosiery trade. The meeting was addressed by Mr. Bridgeman, and a favourable reception was, on the whole, accorded[1100-39] C
0to the proposals. Among extreme trade unionists, however, there is evidence of an attempt to stir up suspicion of such proposals.North- Western.The question of embargoes has again aroused serious unrest, especially in Manchester and Barrow, where the skilled men have decided to support Coventry. The Mersey Federation on the 18th July possed a resolution condemning the volunteer scheme.   In other respects also a considerable degree of disturbance is evident.The feeling of the rank and file in the engineering trade at Liverpool is strongly in favour of the shop stewards, and as a protest against the action of the A.S.E. ofHcials in stating that meetings called by the Reconstruction Committee with regard to the wages question could not be considered official, a warm resolution of confidence in the shop stewards was passed at a mass meeting on the 24th July. An attempt made at a meeting of the Mersey Federation to challenge the conduct of shop stewards in calling mass meetings on their own initiative was outvoted.Much dissatisfaction prevails among men of the Dock and Riverside Workers&apos; Union at the delay in dealing with their applications for increased wages, and a strike is threatened unless some news of an award is heard shortly.Northern,,Matters in this area are satisfactory, and the strike at the Close Engineering Works  the only important unrest reported last week has now subsided.Some unrest is, however, manifest among the boilermakers at Hebburn and Yarrow as to the recent advance of 20 per cent., which the men had anticipated would be retrospective from April instead of the 27th June.At Newcastle the short hours during which the public-houses are open cause much discontent, and a mass meeting recently passed a strong resolution of protest upon this point.South Wales.Few reports have been received from this district, and the situation seems on the whole to be satisfactory, though the Merthyr gasworkers are on strike for ll. a week bonus plus 12t per cent.Scotland.The annual fair holidays have been in progress in Scotland during the last week; -in consequence little information has been received.At Edinburgh a meeting was&apos; organised on the 17th under the auspices of various pacifist bodies, such as the Independent Labour Party, the No-Conscription Fellowship, and the Union of Democratic Control, to protest against the sentences upon conscientious objectors. A hostile reception was, however, afforded, and the meeting was dispersed after the speakers had been subjected to rough handling by discharged soldiers and others.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The general situation is somewhat disturbed this week, though the actual number of men involved in strikes (apart from the stoppage just begun at Coventry) is consider-ably smaller than usual.The Admiralty Labour Department has five new stoppages to report, involving $30 men ; 11 cases of settlement of disputes are noted.At Messrs. Barclay Ourle and S. Stephen and Sons, Govan, where a strike occurred, owing- to dissatisfaction with the &quot;lieu &quot; rates, negotiations are still proceeding to secure a resumption of work after the Fair holidays.The question of non-union men caused a strike of 162 boilermakeis at Messrs. Swan Hunter and Wighara Richardson. Newcastle, as some of the A.R.M.W.&apos;s sent from Ripon camp were not members of the Boilermakers&apos; Society. The case has been referred to the Controller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding.Owing to a demarcation dispute with shipwrights as regards the fixing of guns, 180 engineers ceased work on the 17th July at Messrs. Mordey Carney and Co., Cardiff. A conference was to be held on the 22nd, and the men meanwhile resumed work.
7c The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 7,922 men involved in strikes for the week ending the 17th July. Since that report was received a bad strike has commenced at Coventry over the embargo question, which is dealt with in Part I of this Report.A serious strike of ironmoulders has occurred in the Sheffield area over pay and hours of work. The dispute arose owing to one firm, Messrs. Hadfield&apos;s, reducing the hours of work to forty-eight per week without any reduction of wages. Other firms still continue to work fifty-three hours, and their men are now demanding the same hourly rate for the fifty-three hours as Messrs. Hadfield&apos;s employees are receiving for forty-eight.   Sanction has been refused by the Committee on Production.A short strike of plumbers occurred at His Majesty&apos;s factory at Avonmouth, over a question of demarcation with the heating engineers. The men, however, resumed work on the 19th pending an enquiry upon receipt of a telegram from the Ministry of Labour, pointing out the importance of the work upon which they were engaged.A strike in the nut-and-bolt industry at Darlaston still continues, while a sympathetic strike has occurred at Messrs. Horton and Son, Birmingham. In the latter case, however, work was to be resumed on the 22nd. Work was resumed on the 17th at Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth, and Co,, Gateshead, upon the promise of reinstatement of the woman in question and an enquiry into the circumstances of the dispute.The War Office Contracts Department has three new stoppages of work to report.The most important of these is the strike of cotton operatives in the Wigan area, which, was mentioned last week. The dispute has arisen between the Wigan and District Cotton Employers&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Societies of Card and Blowing Room Operatives&apos; Association, upon the question whether the advance of 25 per cent, in the trade is to he calculated upon the list prices or upon the wages actually paid at the time.So far work has been stopped in eight mills in both Wigan and Manchester and two in Oldham.The Coal Controller reports eleven new stoppages, involving 13,580 men. Work has been resumed in five of these cases.A strike has occurred in the Easington Colliery, Durham, against the advice of the official leaders. Particulars of the dispute have not yet been received, but the question seems to be largely one of procedure, Several stoppages have occurred in South Wales.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports twelve new controversial cases and fifty-five old, eight of which have now been settled. None of these cases appears, however, to be of any importance.As a sequel to the forbidding of overtime by the Ironmoulders&apos; Society, the Ministry of Munitions now reports that eight moulders, who disobeyed the order so that output might not suffer, have been fined by the Society and threatened with expulsion. They are in consequence very indignant and threaten to test the matter by a suit.The Grahame-White Aviation Company have received a demand from their shop stewards for the dismissal of certain men who remained at work during the recent strike. The Ministry have advised the firm to resist this demand, and have threatened prosecution in the event of a strike.A case of alleged victimisation has occurred at Messrs. Noble and Lunn&apos;s Foundry, Felling-on-Tyne, which threatens to produce a strike among the moulders. A demand &apos;had been made for increased wages, which resulted in the handing in of notices, and one of the moulders, upon the expiration of his notice, applied for work elsewhere, but was refused in each case after enquiries had been made of Messrs. Noble and Lunn. The reason given by this man for leaving is his desire to obtain work nearer home. His case is now to be placed before the Ironfounders&apos; Society, and a strike seems almost certain unless the firm change their attitude. A general stoppage was threatened, but the dispute has been referred to arbitration and the men continue at work.The Coal Controller reports one new dispute.This has arisen as to the interpretation of a recent award upon the wages and hours of surface workers, the men contending that the fifty-four week should include meal-times, while the Arbitrator has interpreted his award otherwise.The difficulties with the National Council of Surface Workers&apos; Societies as to the inclusion of the war wage in payment of overtime have not yet been overcome, and further meetings have been arranged.
8The Committee on Production has heard fifty cases in London. These include three cases in the shipbuilding trade, and one application by aircraft workers.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 205 new differences during the week, including cases of interpretations of award, and twenty-four claims for the 12-1 per cent, bonus.D. J. SHACKLETON (For the Minister, who is absent from London).o
