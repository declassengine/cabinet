The more advanced states of , the world have worked out a fairly satisfactory and orderly civilisation.    But, internationally, thanks to Germany, wo are thrown back to the otone Ago.One of the most essential features of any league seems to me to be the installation of a moral standard such as that maintained among individuals of honor.   Dven before Germany smashed tho international fabric,, reprehensible action was condoned under tho broad cover of patriotism; actions union in individuals would have been universally condemned and the perpetrators ostracised from society.I believe that the most vital olement in bringing about a world-wide reign of peace Is to have the same stigma rest upon the acts of nations as upon tho acts of individuals. \hen tho people of a country are held up to the scorn and condemnation of the world because of the dishonorable aote of their representatives, they will no longer tolerate such acts, to bring this about will not, I think, be so difficult as itr-      &quot;   (enp.?P.-5256.      /would
2184would seem, and when this con.dition.jls realised, a nation may be counted upon to guard its treaty obligations with the same fidelity as one guards ono&apos;s honor.I do not believe at the start it would be possible to form any court or to have an international force at the disposal of the court to enforce its decisions. It seems to me that we could not go further than to agree that :-fl) Any war, no matter hov; remote or how lng]Signifiaant the country involved, is the concern of all nations.(2) Some country like Switzerland or Holland should be selected for a centralised peace ground. The ministers sent there should be ipso facto peace delegates.When there is a rumour or murmur of war these delegates should, by previous agreement, automatically meet and(a) Insist that the proposed belligerents agree to settle their differences by arbitration according to the agreement, which as members of a League of nations, they have signed.(b) The arbitrators to be selected as follows: one by each belligerent and these two to select a third.   In the event the two could come to no agreement as to the third, then the selection of the third arbitrator should be made by the League.(o) Either nation to the arbitration may, if dissatis-fied with the findings, have the right to appeal to the League.(d) The finding shall be set aside only by three fourthsvote.(e) If the belligerent against whom the finding is made insists upon going to war, then it shall become obligatory upon every nation in the League to immediately break off all diplomatic, financial and economic relations of every charac-ter and, when and where possible, also exert physical force against the offender.(3)   One of the fundamental principles of the League shall he a declaration that each signatory nation shall bind itself for ever to maintain the same standard that is main-tained among people of honor, so that any nation that failed to live up to the letter and spirit of this agreement shall be held up to public condemnation.(4)   The members of the League shall guarantee each other&apos;s territorial integrity.    Any violation of this guarantee shall be visited by the same penalties as set forth in Paragraph (2) seotion (e).These are my personal views at the moment, and do not represent either the President, or the groups over here that : are working at the problem.I would appreciate your letting me know what you think of the plan I propose.I am, my dear Lord Bobert,Your very sincere,(signed). E.M.HOUSE.
185(ii)COPY OF LETTER PROM LORD ROBERT CECIL TO COLONIAL HOUSE.Foreign Office.Sent by bag c/o Embassy,Washington. July 22nd, 1918,23,7.18.My dear Colenel House,I am extremely grateful to you for your letter ofJune 24.There are indeed a large number of opinions about a league of nations, but I am struck with the fact that certain broad principles seem pretty generally accepted.   One is that international disputes may be divided into two classes, though it is obvious that the definition of classes must be rather nebulous.   Still broadly, almost everyone thinks that only the less important disputes can really be disposed of by a tribunal of arbitration, and that I am sure is true.   In any dispute between two nations involving vital national interests neither of them would be ready to accept the decision of any external tribunal.   Nor do I understand that you dis-agree with that view, though you believe that it might be useful to have a preliminary discussion before a tribunal and then a reference to a council of the nations.   - You nay he right, but I have a kind of feeling that it would be impossible to construct, even for this purpose, a tribunal that would command sufficient confidence to do useful work in vital international disputes.The phillimore scheme, as you will remember, proceeds on ia different plan.   It relies on making the two disputing nations, or groups of nations, bring their quarrel for open discussion before an international conference.   This very much carries out your idea that we must rely on international public opinion as our chief guarantee of peace.     The real trouble is, how are we to secure that the disputa/nts shall bring their dispute before the council of the nations&apos;   Por that purpose, according to the phillimore scheme, coercion is to be employed.Since I sent you our scheme I have seen the French proposals.   Generally speaking, I am not very much impressed with them, but there is one suggestion which seems to me very important, and that is that we should utilise the international organisations which we are nov constructing for the control of raw materials and other things as a lever to compel the nations of the world to accept a league of peace.   The suggestion is that we might make participation in those inter-national organisations dependent on adhesion to the league of peace, which seems a very fruitful suggestion and well worth investigation.I notice that you propose that the components of the league should make a profession of faith to the effect that they will abide by a code of honour.   I think it would be all to the good to have such a profession included in tho instrument by which the league of peace was constructed, but I am afraid I do not think that by itself it could be relied upon.     The example of Germany in thiB war shows that under pressure of false teaching and national danger there is no crime which a civilised nation wilj, not commit, and. the same has been found true over and over again in history..I
1f\ f* 0 d** 2 **I am convinced that unless come form of coercion can he devised which will, work more or leas automatically ;no league of peace will ondure.   You refer to the history of the civilisation of individuals;   hut surely tho great instru-ment of low and order has &quot;been the establishment of tho doctrine of the supremacy of tho law.     So long as codes of laws wore only, or mainly, codes of honour or good conduct they were always disobeyed by anyone who was sufficiently powerful to d* so, with the result that v;o in this country had to endure periods of anarchy culminating in the Wars of the Hoses.   On the Continent things were even worse, and it was very largely the luck of having here so vigorous a ruler as Henry Vll, combined with his skill in devising a moans of cercing the barons end feudal chiefs that really laid the foundations ef our present civilisation.   The Star Chamber by its subsequent history achieved an evil reputation, but at the time of its institution by Henry Vll it wee a most valuable instrument for coercing the forces of disorder,I admit that I do not see my way to the institution of an international Star Chamber, but I do believe that the means of control conferred by the complications fof modern finance and modern commerce should be very powerful, and if. they could be strengthened by such a scheme as the French propose I do believe that we might devise an efficient sanction for the commands of a league of peace.     One great danger, however, I soe in its way:   the French suggest that it should be confined to democratically governed nations M at least so I understand them.I cannot help feeling that this is s most dangerous path for us to travel,     After the Napoleonic wars public opinion in Europe believed that Jacobinism was the great danger to peace, just as now- we believe, with more justification, that Prussian militarism is \?hat we have mainly to fear.   Accordingly the principal nations entered into the Holy Alliance, with a view to suppressing Jacobinism wherever they saw it raising its head.   Very soon Great Britain withdrew from the League, but it persisted with the most disastrous results for many years in Lurepe.     I am- dreadfully afraid that wo may make the same mistake now.   Prussian militarism is indeed a portentous evil, but if, misled by our fear of it, we try to impose on all the nations of the world a form of government which has been indeed admirably successful in America and this country, but is not necessarily suited for all others, I am convinced we shall plant the seeds of very serious international trouble.It is for the same reason that I am reluctant oven to accept your principle that wc ought to guarantee each ethcr&apos;s territorial integrity.   I am sure we ought to guarantee, so far as it can be done, the observance of all treaties, and as a cotollary wo ought to provide means for their periodical renewal, but I do not know that territorial integrity flhBWJLd bo specially singled out from other treaty obligations and as it were crystallized for all time.I hope these observations will not seem to you very desultory and unintelligible, but the subject is a difficult and complicated one.Again thanking you very warmly for sending me your letter,Believe me,Yours very sincerely,R.-C.I am in hope that the Government will adopt the phillimore Report as a basis &apos;-of discussion with the Allies.
18,u.jnd:jd distribution gtrqsusw to the king and war cabinet.De cypher.   Lord Reading. (Washington). July 23^.1918. R, 4,15.p.rn. July 24th.l918.NO. 3354.Very,,.Urgent ,. and Be cret.At my interview with President to-day reference was made to League of Nations,,   Informed him that it was heing much discussed in England,and had been debated in the House of Lords, and was the subject of considerable Press comment and correspondence,Informed him His Majesty.&apos;s Government might possiblybe asked to discuss the &quot;matter in the House of Commons. The President hoped nothing would be done which would even informally bind His Majesty1 s Government before there had been full opportunity for interchange of views.   He himself has been at work on a paper regarding Phillimore Committee report,which he had hoped to have finished before,hut his time had been so occupied that it was still uncompleted.He was in substantial agreement with Colonel House&apos;s letter of June 24th on this subject;,but this letter was not exhaustive of President&apos;s views.   I hope it will not be necessary, to take any steps in this matter until after my arrival in London.(25.7c8-4)c
