(This Ooc^naent is.the P ope] ; -:\39 21/prance/1488.M CA3X3QT-PKHTOTTION OF VSHSBREAL DISBASjS I IT THE AKMY* l^\-S^si^6&apos;memorandum by the secretary of State for War.3,; i^y fMfar Cabinet on 18th March, 1918, decided (W.C.366 (13)) that:h/^CLUJ.. (a)   Mai sons de .Tolerance, in France should be placedout of bounds for His Majestys Forces.(b)   Tho Army Council should investigate what stepsare being taken by the French Government and theCanadian Military Authorities to prevent Venereal disease.iaons de lerance ,aced out bounds.In arriving at decision (a) the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on the subject of the then Secretary of State (G.T.3932).    In this and at the proceedings of the cabinet, the argument was placed before the Cabinet that to place the houses out of bounds would, in the opinion of the military authorities, increase the dangers from venereal disease, necessitate an increase in the number of the military police and also offend the susceptibilities of our Ally.   The Field Marshal commanding in chief, France, has Issued the instructions required to give effect to the decision, but he has now made very strong representations as to the effect of this order, stating that it will lead to an increase of incontinence with a greater ri3k of disease in each case, has asked for an increase of from 350 to 400 men in the Military police, and further has forwarded copies of communications received, under a covering letter of the French Mission, from the president of the council, French Ministry of War and the Governor of Havre,&amp;r Cabinet , These documents urge the reconsideration of theI decision in view of the increased danger to the health of the troops and of the civil population.   They point out that, if Maisons de Tolerance are prohibited, the women will have I recourse to clandestine prostitution which offers more dangerous temptations to soldiers and leads to an increase in the consumption of spirits^.-With regard to decision (b):-Enquiries have been instituted and the results set out below,A*    Steps taken by the French Government.tepa taken These are set out in an Instruction dated 25th1 the September , 1916, issued by the Under Secretary of State forfench and     Military Medical Services, who considered that, in view of taadian        the seriousness of the danger to the military and civil ilitary       population, it had become imperative to increase prophylactic tohorities,   effort by organising new formations specialised in the diagnosis and treatment of venereal diseaso.The* In the regulated houses only beer and harmless liquors are permitted.
The Anti-Venereal arrangements aro broadly asfollows(I) At Regimental and other Depots:-(a) lectures, illustrated when possible by lantern slides, etc. Collective and individual advice on the danger of infection and means of protection.The men are instructed on the undesirability of us&apos;ing other men&apos;s canteens, pipes, etc., and, in view of the importance of early treatment, they are encouraged not to conceal the disease.(b) Medical Inspections.   These take place once a fortnight.   (Each man is examined ^separately and under conditions of complete discretion),   soldiers are also minutely examined before and after leave, No leave is granted to a man likely to prove contagious.(c) prophylaxy among Civilians.   Where there is no venereological centre or hospital annexe, military medical officers take the best measures the circumstances admit of in agreement with the civil authorities to check clandestine prostitution. Public houses, cafes, or other houses found to be contaminating centres are placed out of bounds. When doctors attached to the Depots of Units are called upon to take a share in the inspection of brothels, they endeavour to make a daily examination of the women staying there, and an examination of other registered prostitutes twice a week.(d) Treatment of Patients.    provision is made for the treatment of simple and mild cases without complications in regimental infirmaries.   Other and more serious cases are sent to (i) stations of urology and (ii) stations of dermatology and venereology.(e) Surveillance of Eormer Patients.     This is effected by means of individual cards kept by doctors under strict conditions of secrecy and when drafts or individuals are sent to the front or a man&apos;s unit i3 changed, these clinical card3 are sent to the men&apos;s new Medical Officers,A special examination of patients is made periodically, more especially in the case of those recently discharged from hospital.(II) Medical Stations:-The Chief medical officer gives convalescents as many lectures and talks as possible on the disease.Convalescents are examined twice a month.(III)Special Centres:A Dermatological and venereological Centre is created for diagnosis, therapeutics, and prophylaxy in every Military region (in exceptional circumstances regional cub-centres are authorised to deal with all venereal and cutaneous infections).   These centres provide Hospital services, consultation eervices, laboratories and dental services.The
395The aim -of the hospital and consultation services is (a) to cure in the shortest time possible primary or secondary cases, (b) to destroy sources of contagion as quickly ao pps3ible and (c) to send back the men promptly to the front strong and fit for service.A Register of all cases is kept, containing a detailed diagnosis of each man&apos;s case and on discharge from the hospital when the patient has been simply examined by the Consultation Services, a copy of his medical card is sent to the Chief Medical Officer of the Depot or Factory where he is stationed and follows all the patient&apos;s moves.Every patient discharged receives a prescription sheet and a list of Medical Instructions - both of which are clearly explained to him.As regards Prophylaxy, an experienced lecturer from the Centre periodically lectures at the Depots, 7actorics and Medical Units of the region and clear pamphlets of prophylactic propaganda are distributed.A monthly report is made by the Chief of the Centre to the Under Secretary for Medical Services&quot;.(IV) Support given by medical officers towards the prophylaxy of venereal diseases among the civil population.Such officers are or.joined to assist the civil authorities as much as possible and help in the work done by Venereal medical annexes to military hospitals among civilians of both sexes.A daily inspection of women staying in houses of prostitution is enforced, and in other cases a bi-7/eckly inspection^A consultation service and hospital ward is provided for town patients.A monthly report is rendered from every annexe.B.    Steps taken by the Canadian Military Authorities.Briefly the procedure as detailed in the copy of a report dated 12th April, 1918, by the Directpr of Medical Services, Canadian Contingents, is as follows:-(i)   Instructions to all troops.    Every three months lectures on Prevention of &quot;communicable disease are given and special lectures against venereal Disease every six weeks.   lectures have also been given under the auspices of such associations as the Young Menvs Christian Association. A detailed ^procedure&apos; is given to each Medical Officer in regard to venereal disease so as to secure uniformity.(ii)   Early treatment Centres,, have been established,where a unified procedure for treatment is insisted upon.   A reciprocity has been established with other Colonial Porccs in these Centres.(iii)   Calomel ointment tubes are furnished free to all soldiers on request, and nearly all avail thorn-solves of them.   After continence, reliance is, however, placed on early treatment after exposure and the soldier has it well impressed upon him that Calomel ointment and early treatment only give a modicum of protection.
*39G(Iv) Very strict (weekly surprise) inspection of all Mother&apos; ranks for venereal disease is made.(v) Venereal Disease Hospitals give frequent and special clinics to Medical Officers in contiguous areas to establish co-operation between -the latter and their staffs,(vi) Assistant Provost Marshals co-operate as much aspossible to drive the more objectionable women out of the camp zones.(vri) Every endeavour is made to get infected men intoHospital as early as possible so as to shorten their stay for treatment.(viii) Special Examination Centres are being established at Buxton and Liverpool where all soldiers showing Venereal Disease on their Medical history sheets, being invalided to Canada, are examined and their condition recorded for dealing with in Canada.The procedure outlined above has been established inall areas.As an example of the effectiveness of what has been done the following figures relating to the Shorncliffe   Area may bo quoted:-Average percentage of venereal cases per month 1915 s 1.82ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;       &apos;      &quot;     1913 * 1.73fr* &quot; &quot; &quot;       &quot;       &quot;     1917       .95);These, figures show a reduction of 45-5^5 over 1916 and 47.7^ over 1915. &apos;It is considered that the reduction attained has been well worth all the trouble which has been takon.30th July, 1918.
