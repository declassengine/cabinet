SECRET.     j OG.T.- 5299.      1  :^V REORUITING FROM AGRICULTURE IN SCOTLAND;SUPPLY OP SOLDIER LABOUR FOR THE HARVEST.(J.T*  264 In a Memorandum dated 2nd July^ I sailed attention%* the grave shortage of labour for the harvest in Scotland. I trust that an early opportunity will be afforded for discussion of the subject.I. should like at the same time to refer to the deci-far Cabinet sion reached by the War Cabinet on the lot July? after dia-43&amp;/I1 ouasion of a Memorandum by me oh the question of thed. T. 4-971;. recruitment of agricultural workers in Scotland.   The ptint &apos; I wish to raise is that that decision, which was intended to secure equal treatment as between England and Scotland, has failed to do so, because it proves to have been founded on a mlsapprehension of the faets.The decision was to the effect that calling up notices issued to meH employed in agriculture should be can-celled in Scotland as well as in England and Wales if issued after the 26th June. The War Cabinet were under the impression when this decision was reached, that it would give equal &quot;treatment as between England and Wales and Scotland, not only nominally but substantially.In the discussion on 1st July the Minister of Kational Service stated that the full quota of 5,?00 men for Scotland had, he understood, been posted by the previous day.     As regards England and Wales0 the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the reduction in the number of recruits whioh would result from the decision of the War Cabinet-Would be &quot;very small&quot;. The Minister of Kation-al Service made a similar statement as regards English agricultural labourers, adding that the principal effect would be felt in Wales.   The basis upon which the Was? Cabinet proceeded on 1st July  was therefore that, both in $$gland and Walfcs and in Scotland, the deficit-^ on the respective quotas, would be very jamail.These anticipations have been realised aa regards Scotland, where the deficit on the quota M 5**)OQ is only 100, or leso than 2 per cent.   They havenfiot realised in England and Wales where, according to information furnished tp me by the Minister of National Service, the reduction is frwa 30,000 to 21,839, i.e,, 8,161 or 27 per cent.I submit that upon this corrected information the decision of the War CaMnetjon thf^Lat July should be reoon-sidered in the light of the principle of equal treatment as between England and Scotland which was enunciated by the Chanoellor of the Exchequer.   X appreciate that it may bemore difficult to get men baok from the Army than to refrain from posting them.    But I see no other way of avoiding inequitable treatment *f agriculture in Sootland, and I urge the War Cabinet to instruct that men recently posted should be released till after the harvest to the number necessary to redress the
h    2   -403balance, namely, 1,400.     I suggest that the individuals should be selected by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, the Minlctry nf National Service, and the War Office, on the principle that the Board are entitled to elaim releases on agricultural grounds up to a total of 1,400.With regard to harvest labour, 1 desire to emphasise what *ms said ib my Memorandum of 2na July.The Minister of National Service has been good enough to make special arrangements whereby a considerable number of prisoners of watf and boys will be made available for the harvest in Scotland, in addition to women, convalescent soldiers, war agricultural volunteers j Irish men and women / and other helpers.     But all these classes will, it is estimated not provide more than 5,000 extra hands to moot a demand for about 1^000.     There is thus an estimated shortage, of 10,000.. Hitherto the Army Council have not seen their way to agree to provide the necessary assistance upon which the farmers in Scotland have been counting. . I desire/ however, to urge most strongly that soldiers of low category should be provided up to a&apos; total of 10,000 for the harvest in Scotland so as to avoid losses which may be disastrous.My proposals are briefly     v -(1)   That 1,400 ff the men recently called up from   &apos; agriculture in Scotland should be released from the Army so as to secure equality of treatment with England and Wales.(2)   That 10,000 low category sol diers should be made available for harvest work in Scotland to meet an imminent shortage,(Signed)   ROBERT MUHRO.Scottish Office,2nd August, 1918.
