In Australia a mother is given -(a) 2/- a day if she can show that her son would have contributed to her support after enlistment,or(b) 2/- a day if she can show a change in financial circumstances.2* In Canada, 25/- a week is given to a mother with 3 serving sons,s* In the United States, a statement of a serving soldier Ts^tai:en in regard to dependence; that is to say, dependence is assumed if the form is filled up.   There is, however, the safeguard that the man himself must contribute from 10/- to 15/- a week, and the State-is liable to make up the difference only between that and the amount of pre-war dependence.4. Separation allowance is payable to fathers in Australia and Hew Zealand only if invalids.5, larents&apos; pensions are always on the basis of pre-vious dependence, except that in the Dominions other than Canada, as in the United Kingdom, pecuniary need is a ground for a grant of pension.   In the united States, pensions are given in cases where, if the man were living, his widowed mother would have been dependent upon him for support,The
2, Whitehall Gardens, S ../.1.23rd   July, 1918.The Committee arc of opinion that, taking, into ooneidera-tion that all compulsory allotments, (with the exception of 1/6 paid by the sailor and narine) are now paid by the State, ^ and having regard to the comparative rates of pay of memoere of British and other forces, the proposals recommended in their Report are fair find reasonable,The Committee are agreed that, subject to consideration of the 3 inority Reports already presented by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and the Financial Secretary to the war Office, the principles of the recommendations, as put forward in paragraph 6 of their Report, should bo adopted. I   -vhether the amount of the&quot; flat rate should be 3/6 or 5/- a week is a matter for the decision of the Jar Cabinet.(intd.)   G.U.B.
