POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENTJuly 14, 1918FOREIGN OFFICE.MEMORANDUMGERMANY/01.4.onTHE   PRUSSIAN  FRANCHISE   BILL1,   The German Wireless Service announced on July 23rd that Scbeidemann had addressed an audience of 12,000 people In the town park at Cassel and bad informed them that the Imperial Chancellor had intimated to him that the Prussian whamber of Deputies is to be dissolved this year and new writs for an election issued.    The reason is that the Chamber and the Upper House refuse to redeem the King!B word, i.e. the Royal promise of equal franchise.There is every reason to believe that a general election would result in the overthrow of the Prussian Junker and Great Industrialist majority and thus seoure the passage of the Equal-Franchise Bill.    The system of second ballots makes it possible, even under the old franchise, for a coalition of the more democratic section of the Catholic Centre, the li&amp;tsraiL National Liberals, the Radicals (Progres-sives) and the Socialists, to return a sufficiently   in-creased number of their candidates to turn the present majority into.a minority.    That would be a blow at the roots of the Junkers1 power, as the King, if he is bent on reform, can always manipulate the Upper Rouse by a creation of new members.This move of Rertling&apos;s shows , as Bethmann Kollweg&apos;sflhise showed .last year, that the Government wants a free hand and is tired of Junker control.    rJ:here is a significantThis is an announcement of very great importance.move in the King&apos;s Easter and Simmer messages on the Fran
105-2-article in the Frankfurter Zeitnnfl of July 17 (No.196 First Morning Ed.) showing how the domestic political situation influences foreign policy and how the intrigues of the Junker Party in the press and elsewhere have for years hampered the Foreign Office and have rendered a steady and consistent policy impossible.2.   It must, no doubt, be borne in mind that Hertling, his master and his agents, will attempt to use this policy of Prussian Reform in order to mislead the lilies, particularly the pacifists among their populations, and to make them be-lieve that a Liberal and pacific regime is about to be estab-lished in Germany.     The personal power of the King and Emperor will not be diminished by reform.    The chief conse-ouenoe in this regard will probably be that the King and Emperor will be freer to choose his own advisers and to follow their advice.    He and his Chancellor will also be freer to manoeuvre for an advantageous peace if they come to the conclusion that a decisive German victory is out of the question,    Their attempts to eajole the Allies will not be so effectively interrupted by Pan-German vociferation. If, therefore, a more reasonable spirit is created in Prussia by the threat to curtail the power of the Junkers and the great industrialists, or by its actual curtailment, there will be all the greater need for vigilance in examining, or, if necessary, rebutting fallacious German overtures. !Ehe people whose views find expression in the Frankfurter SeJLtung are more dangerous and insinuating to deal with than the most extreme Junker.    Hertling is also dangerous, owing to his extreme devotion to the Church and his consuming desire to exalt Catholicism and the Papacy by helping them
to appear as the spiritual and intellectual authors of peace whiah would, at the same time, ho essentially a &quot;Gorman peace&quot;.
