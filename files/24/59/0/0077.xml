BBPORT ON MISSION.Part 1.The Hi3sion entrusted to me at Mr. Lloyd George*s request, consisted in supplying the British Government with suggestions as to the best means to employ for the rapid re-organisation of the combatant units of the British Army and their maintenance to full fighting strength.The value of such co-operation was fully justified by the experience we have already acquired in the art of making use of all available national resources in man-power.   This experience was to be placed at the disposal of an Allied nation less severely tried than us, which, owing to its more gradual entry into the struggles, is still in possession of reserves, whereas ours are being exhausted.The problem consisted on one hand in drawing up an e estimate of the exisitng resources in man-power and on the other in considering the best means of turning these resources to account. Owing to the military situation at that time it was particularly urgent to take steps in the matter and fill in the gaps existing in the rank3 of the armies in Prance.     The necessary personnel for this immediate reinforcement of the lines could not therefore have been supplied in time by recruiting; it had to be drafted without further delay from the previously mobilised effectives. On the other hand, the recruiting process had to be regulated so as to ensure at all events the subsequent maintenance of the reconstituted effectives to their full strength.Any search for and. &quot;a fortiori&quot;, any estimate of available men could only be made by the British authorities and my role consisted solely in endeavouring to make them share the views of the French Government regarding the possibility of a greater effort   on the part of Great Britain and to reiterate the pressing appeal made by the Prime Minister and the Generalissimo of the Allied armies giving the reasons why this effort should be made without delay.A comparative study of the utilisation of man-power both in Sngland and Prance based upon data supplied by the War Office and the Ministry of National Service permitted me to prove the existence of available reserves in Great Britain,   it was not my business to enter into detailed investigations although I have been requested to do so -several times, for a foreign delegate could not assume the role of inspector without running the risk of rousing justifiable susceptibilities; even his silence could bo interpreted as praise or blame.It was enough to let the figures speak for themselves. The verification of previously exchanged data and their completion in certain respects resulted in the production of the documents included in the attached memorandum (annex 1).   An examination of this memorandum leads to the inevitable conclusion that the United Kingdom has still something to fulfil before her effort can be compared with that of Prance, whether from the point of view of the total sacrifices made for the common cause or fromthat
9 K /Ihi .Jthat of the utilisation pf man-power In riew of essential military aimsBenefiting by this delay, Great Britain has the advantage ,of still being able to draw combatants from sources vhioh are already exhausted in franco.   At the moment when the discrepancy between the opponent forces in the field renders the situation more critical than ever, this advantage must be utilised without further delay. Should Great Britain hesitate or delay in melting use of her last resources in man-rcver, she would favour the German plans which have evidently &quot;bean irade with a view to dealing us the final blovr before the Russian defection could be counter-balanced by the American intervention.As shown by tho tables of comparison, the above-mentioned reserves, hitherto untouched, can bo drawn from all classes and grades.   At all events, as I informed the ^rime Minister, while maintaining a foreign observers point of view, if France still possessed the man-power resources which are at present available in the United  Kingdom she would know how to transform them into the effectives necessary to assure the future - she would know how to find immediately 200 to 300,000 combatants from amongst the mobilised men and how to recruit from the civilian population enough soldiers to replace the losses which must &quot;be anticipated in the severe fighting to come.   In order to do this, we should only have, to continue to apply both in the Army and in Home Services the rigorous measures which have proved their efficiency by the results obtained&apos; indeed, the utilisation of our man-power has been so complete -that to-day our resources are practically exhausted.The last big effort we were able to make was to collect a sufficient number of reserves for the maintenance of effectives to their full fighting strength for the 1918 campaign, this in spite of the strain expected after the Russian defection.    Our forecasts proved to he correct: the looses sustained during the &quot;battle of the Aisne can be made good and our divisions &quot;brought up to full strength if only a few woelce respite is allowed us before the third act of the Gorman offensive begins.   Subsequently we shall only be able to count yearly on the men who reach the age age of enlistment; our effectives will certainly decrease, but we shall at least have &quot;borne without fail the strain of tho 1918 campaign. It would appear that the same cannot &quot;be said ahout the United Kingdom, seeing that at the beginning of the year the British Army was reduced by a quarter of its battalions, seeing ileo that the divisions that suffered most in the battles of the Somme and in Flanders have not yet boen brought back to their full strength. The only logical conclusion is that the methods which have enabled us to make this year again so great an effort must be imitated in Great Britain.A similar effort is necoesary not only to frustrate the German piano, but also to make a favourable impression upon public opinion in Prance.   35ie French nation, the whole of which has been under arms for the last 4 yearc now suffers another invasion; our soldiers witness again the piteous processions of women and children fleeing before the Invaders - Paris itself Ig threatened.   The loss of the capital, the vital junction for the entire French railway system, and kthe centre of war industries, would not only be a material disaster but no one can conjecture the consequences which ito abandonment under the pressure of military events would havo on the policy of the Entente.   With its&apos; perdeptions clarified by the sufferings it has bomo so long, the French nation feels the tragedy of its situation acutely and is anxious to ascertain whether her Allies are hand in hand with her.   France knows that the United States are answering her call, but she also is awaro that they will come too late and she needs immediate enceuraGement from her nearest ally.   The greatest danger of all for Prance would be to entertain the idea that Great Britain relics on America to continue the war.   This danger was felt whan it was -decided that the English divisions which had been
y c r 6 jreduced to their cadres after the April fighting., were to &quot;be made up to strength by moans of American effectives.   Tt is necessary that these divisions should be immediately reformed by merns of British effectives, if only in order to avoid a wave of opinion, the consequences of which could be disastrous.Such are the views which, I ably supported by M-Mautoux, laid before Mr. Lloyd George, Lord jjilner and sir Auckland Geddes, Minister of National Service, in the coarse of the interviews to which I had the honour of being invited,   I may say that, in general I met with no opposite on -   I w-J I state later i;he developments and discussions arising :f rcq the examination of points of detail and methods of execution; for the present, I will limit myself to a brief summary of the general sense of tho information which I gathered,(1)     In his organisation of the Ministry of National Service, Sir Auckland Geddes has created a machine which is perfectly equipped, and capable of rapidly and effectively carrying out any measures adopted by the Government with&apos; regard to recruiting; Sir Auckland Geddes is not the man to allow himself to be discouraged by obstacles which may arise, and he moreover appears confident of the support of Klnieterial Labour Departments in procuring, by retrenchment or substitution, the release of a sufficient number of men to meet the requirements of the Army. If his intentions are realised there will be no cause to regret that Great Britain has ncrt up to the present time, made full use of her reserves of man-power.(2)    Lord miner has formally declared that French opinion is not justified in its belief that Great Britain considers her effort to be at an end, and is preparing to transfer her responsibilities to America.   Lord Milner is fully alive to tho dangers of the situation, and promises renewed effort on the part of Great Britain.   The divisions taken from the front in April will be reconstituted by British effectives, and a similar procedure adopted with regard to tho divisions lost at the end of Hay so that the total number of divisions will consequently equal that existing before 21st Karch,   I am not in a position to state the exact details of the special measures to be adopted to achieve this end, and I must confess that, at one time, I feared the measures contemplated were looked upon as merely provisional to be put into execution in case of grave psril, the present disproportion of forces not appearing in lice if to be considered a3 constituting sufficient danger.   Lord Hilner!s assurances have, however, completely removed any such apprehension.Of the 51 divisions thus constituted (not including 10 Dominion), 47 will bo ready by the end of June, the remaining 4 be in;-&apos; promised in July, enemy operations permitting.   We know that the necessary reserves exist and from whence they can be drawn. There remains the task of grouping and organisation.   A suitable proportion of men will be incorporated in divisions consisting of B men, tho unit so constituted not being considered a priori as of inferior quality,(3)    The following points were specially dwelt upon by the Prime Minister(i)    With a view to the measures to be adopted in order to-increase the fighting strength of the British Army, the Prime Minister asked for information concerning the sub-divisions of French effectives according to Arm, and in each Arm and Service the distribution of combatants and non-combatants of the Services of the Front and Rear.   This information has been 3UppM0i..(ii)
25S(ii) Impressed no doubt by our satisfactory-position, entirely due to the measures adopted in constituting reserves to meet the great effort of the 1918 campaign; Mr. 1.16yd George r asked me whether our calculations had not been thrown out by recent events; I replied that, although as yet unable to state the exact figures of our losses on the Aisne, I was iie^cctjielew convinced that a respite of a few weeks would prove jmifioisht to enable us to reconstitute our [DivisionsP   Information obtained from Paris has. enabled me Biibseqden&amp;ly to hand Mr. Lloyd George a note establishing and confirming my assertion.(iii) Mr, Lloyd George farther expressed his surprise at Germany-&quot;e being, ablej notwithstanding her very considerable effort, to maintain the strength of her effectives.This can bo accounted for by the fact that Germany, similarly to Franco, from the very first adopted measure with a view to the exhaustive exploitation of her male population of all ages and capacities,   tfhen hix sources of recruiting are completely exhaustedj she will, similarly to France, be reduced to depending on the young OXaeooa available each year *   Owing, however, to the rapid increase in her birthrate during the past period, the strength of the      r.cMves d:* awn from thin source increases year by year,   0&amp;y.c.&quot;ilai;:Uae ba*ed on comparison of the total population of both col mivies are therefore of no value, and should bo substituted by comparison of the birthrate in the neighbourhood of the year 1900.The results thus obtained not only show a serious balance in favour of Germany, but there is no apparent roaspn why German   effectives should be more rapidly used up than those of the Allies, unless indeed the latter devote their whole energy to recuriting.
9 k nkid 6CONCLUSION,1*    The United Kingdom still has at her disposal large reserves of man-power which should enable her, in any contingency to maintain a number of divisione in proportion to the &apos; importance of tho share which she should take in the    ^Alliance.2.     She can keep up this military effort without on that account being forced, to limit her co-operation in meeting the general needQ of the Entente, in industrial economical and naval spheres.3.     The means to be employed in setting free these reserves of man-power oonsits in measures of economy and in management applying.both to men called up and to those fit for service, Ttut remaining in their civilian occupations.4,     The measures of economy include reduction of the numbers engaged in military or civilian labour services, diminution of the lavishness with which those services are endowed and increase of individual output.     They are based upon a strict limitation of the needs of each department, Industry etc.5.     The question fof management essentially implies substitution, which should result in bringing forward all men capable   of active service, and in replacing them in the rear or in tho interior by men less fit, by women or by foreigners, These measures involve an exact classification of all male pernonnel according to physical capacity j   further, they can only be efficacious if tho definition of fitness for active service is given a wider meaning.6. It is not possible to describe in detail the sources whence these various measures would allow of drawing man-power probably they would apply everywhere.7.    The first measures taken have allowed us to foresee, within a short space of time, the reconstruction of the British Army in Prance with the number of division it h&amp;&amp; at the opening of the&apos; year, without reckoning any American troops.    Lord MiInerts promises on this subject are definite.8,    On tho other hand, estimates relating to recruiting seem sufficient to ensure the maintenance of the forces when   , they have been reconstructed.9.     The information supplied does not comprise all the required data.     Not being acquainted with details of the resources   used for reconstructing the divisions, we do not know whether the result will bo to leave sufficient reserves for the immediate maintenance of the Units in the course of a coning great battle.    we shall be informed on this point when the British Government has communicated to uc the balance-sheet of the available reserves and estimates similar to the one sent to Mr. Lloyd George at hie request.(Sd.) A. ROLRE.
9 K QB.   UTILISATION OF IIOBILISZD F0HCB3.*Tho question of the methods to be used to draw fighting unite from the personnel already mobilised, was one of immediate interest, since it offered the only moans of reforming without delay, and without levying upon the American contingents, the 3ritish divisions which practically ceased to exist in consequence of the losses suffered on tho Some and the Aione.It has been pointed out above (sec part I), in agreement v/ith Lord 1-iilncr&apos;s promises, that this result was to be obtained within a ahort period, except as regards four divisions which could not be reformed before July, and that all the Divioiono would receive a sufficient proportion of such troops as would ensure their value for active oervice.These decisions meet the requirements laid down by the French Government and by General Foch, as far as concerns immediate necessities.   It is important to know the extent of the effort which we may expect in the same direction, after this firct process has been accomplished.The effectives necessary for re-forming the divisions could be obtained (approximately) by adding to the levy of 75,000 men already estimated as available from Class B those units withdrawn or about to &quot;be withdrawn from the $astern theatre of war.    Therefore, should any forces have been drafted to these   \ divisions from Lines of Communication Services or from Kcme Defence Units, a levy of this kind is entirely acce3ory, and cannot be considered as solving the general question of economy in the personnel of these Services, a question forced upon our attention when comparing the position of the two armies in this respect.The lavish organisation of the British Army has not &quot;been denied non-combatant services.It arises from the fact that these services have been created de novo and developed regardless of economy in man-power^ It is also due to the inveterate habits of the British people; the intention has been to check this tendency, progressively, and some results have been achieved, but I have been told that, in * order to obtain a rapid reduction in the personnel of non-combatant cervices, with a view to releasing considerable numberjs for the front, a veritable revolution would be necessary.I have refrained from suggesting that the present situation might demand that such a revolution should be risked., I only stated what we accomplished in equally critical circumstances and how the year 1916, in particular, witnessed the maximum numerical result of an effort of organisation which has only been relaxed since then owing to the exhaustion of available material. I had already supplied this information in a note delivered to the *.Var Office at the time of my first fission, and repeated it to llr. Lloyd George at his own request.   I was unable to point out. in which branches of the services it would be wise to attempt some degree of limitation.   To form an opinion on this subject a careful study based upon investigations would have been necessary and this was incompatible with the character of ray Idission.  Knowing that susceptibilities might be roused, I oven refrained from questions which would have supplied me with accurate data on the subject.As I explained to Hr. Lloyd George, my conviction as to the possibility of economy, was formed from a comparison of methods adopted and. results obtained in the British Army and the French Army respectively; this led me to the conviction thatcombatants
combat ant a., could be drawn&apos; from-all services,If the Government is convinced of this fact, and if this conviction is shared by Headquarters, the methods to ImTTO^TOLI^ be easily found.   The method applied to the French Army is to fix three age-limits below which no fit man maybe employed:-.1.    Outside the combatant units;3.     Outside the front line Services;3.     Outside the military zone.The only possible exceptions to these rules apply to fathers of large families, and certain indispensable specialists; even these exceptions are determined by a fixed age-limit.These very simple rules allow of easy verification, which is placed in the hands of special inspectors, whose duty it is to superintend the correct utilisation of the personnel in each service, and to Impose limits.where it is considered possible. Further, Headquarters carries out a permanent system of substitution, with the object of replacing soldiers fit for activeservice and who are still employed in the interior by men not liable to be called up. jAs regards the application of the rule of age-limit, whether in lines of communication or in the Interior, a dificulty may   arise as regards the British Army from the fact that this rule has not been applied from the beginning, i,e. at enrolment.The system adopted by the Ministry of National Service might therefore be preferred,   This system is based upon a preliminary estimate of the contingent to be levied upon each profession; its application presupposes conscientious co-operation of the departments concerned, which would be forced to deprive themselves of their most valuable elements; the task of inspectors superintending its execution in .all services would be more difficult than under the alternative system.In any case, it seems that a drastic revision of the non-combatant services, in favour of the fighting units can be carried out only after re-classifications of available men from the standpoint of physical fitness.   I have mentioned that the Ministry of National Service has undertaken a similar task for all non-mobilised men; it seems also that in some cases measures have been taken for the reclas3ification of men in Home Services, but I have not met with evidence leading me to suppose that such measures would be applied to men serving in France.   They would, however, &quot;be particularly useful there, since the conditions of strength and, perfect physical ability formerly necessary to be classed as a combatant caused many who are fit for active service to be enrolled in Services where they certainly should stay no longer (1).    ^(1) Information from various sources leads me To fnTnK^nat the I adoption of a three category system for the claesifIcation of men - 1 for service, has been a eause of weakness it ie Indeed easy to eotj aside responsibility by classification in an intermediate category? I it is thought at the Yfar Office that this method is often adopted % [ Medical Boards, especially during periods when scanty officialrsporia I induce slackness. An Inspecter-Geneyai of the British Hedical Servioi I has summed very clearly the contrast between the two administration! j as follows: &quot;In Prance, every man ie supposed to be fit for active I service unless he proves the contrary; in England, the supposition ia reversed.
2m he- OoTeTTmerrVjahould also eMeavour to overcome the pTc-Judlc-ee of commanding officers against the employment of men belonging to the second category.   Too many of these officers are still influenced by traditions which insist that a soldier must be a sportsman; some even speak ironically of the men compsoing our territorial units, and trace the cause of certain disappointing results to their age or their exhaustion. It might be well, tt put before them that if Prance, in choosing her soldiers, had adopted the eclotic methods favoured by the Allied Army, a considerable portion of her divisions would have been . practically annihilated long ago, and the question of the extension of the British front would have become urgent much earlier.,1 have been led to deal with this subject, owing to a question put by       Lloyd George in the presence of Lord Milner and Sir Auckland Geddee; the possibility of employing a larger number of men as combatants was not discussed, but they agreed nevertheless in the opinion that tho British race cannot equal the French on this point: only a small proportion of the nation is engaged in agriculture (1), and9 on the other hand, the training due to years of compulsory service is lacking.   Moreover it has been pointed out to me that emigration has deprived the British contingents of thoir best elements.   These considerations must be kept in mind when comparing the numbers of combatants furnished by tho two nations.Stille it seemed to me that these reasons could not apply to young men of 18; I showed that, amongst us, deducting a very small number classed for auxilliary Service, all men of the  young contingents were at onco attached to combatant units, and never solely to an auxiliary service, tho latter being supplied by the disabled men from the fighting contingents.   On the other hand, from the commencement of the war, several hundred thousand men have been drafted from the services into combatant units.   I do not know whether these suggestions will be efficacious; tho application of such measures necessarily implies the existence of military tradition, in consequence of which the fighting man is conscious of superiority te the man in the rear, even though ho should envy him.   The lines followed by our Allies in the administration of recruiting material arise rather from a purely utilitarian conception, the influence of which remains preponderant.For the present then, tho majority of the public do not appear astonished to see such a large number of men, dressed in khaki, who although young and in good health, remain in Home services.   But those who feel no surprise at tho fact are-capable at times of using it as an argument for expressing surprise at a demand for fresh recruits.   Lord Milner informed mo that it was this feature which led him to try to get these men sent out, but it was immediately proved to him that they were indispensable; to us, who have carried out a drastic revision of this kind, the matter causes no surprise.   Departments acting as employers should not be ankRd&apos;to renounce their workers of their own will; in some way, they must bo forced to contribute men, upon the condition of providing them with substitutes in proportion to their needs.   In order to decide as to which departments might contribute men without substitution, and as to those which must receive assistance, an organised serviceof(i)   Proportion of men engaged in agriculture:In France ........ ..........................     aIn Great Britain (omitting Ireland) .......1/lC.
  01of inspection is required, such as we have at work in prance.&quot; It was therefore impossible to give details on this point beforehand.   Still, at Ilr. Lloyd Georges request, I considered it my duty to point out what had    especially struck me in examining documents connected with National Service or the War Office.1.     The forces of the Air Service number 214,000 men; in France, with a larger number of machines, 100,000 men only-(-soldiers or sailors) are-attached to this Service.2.    The forces enrolled in the Navy during the first four months of 1918 number 32,000 men.   Considering the small proportion of losses sustained, the increase in naval effectives is considered as very important.   Vie quite understand that owing to new methods of warfare the Admiralty must create new organisations, but for this very reason older organisations certainly cease to be useful and we cannot refrain from asking whether it is not by oversight that such organisations are still maintained.3.    Notwithstanding certain demands which have been made upon them, the total strength of troops for Home Defence was on 20th May, 141,000, exlcusive of Training Centres personnel and Marines co-operating in Coast Defence.   Naval bases should no doubt be protected from attack; the troops destined for Home Defence appear, however, to be organised with a view to opposing a veritable invasion.   The unquestioned superiority of the British Navy rendering unlikely any such eventuality, it may be asked whether Great Britain, in view of the Continental situation, should not seriously contemplate sending a great $art of these troops, the entire Mobile Force in fact, (exclusive of troops required for Ireland) to France.   A contingent of fit trained men drawn from the fixed Defences, and immediately available might be substituted.I   was thereupon informed that General Robertson, when taking over the Command of the 7orces for Home Defence, complained of the depleted state of their effectives.I was of the opinion that General Robertson intended, by this statement, to emphasize his view with regard to the abandonment of operations in all secondary theatres of war, and went so far as to suggest that, in this case, Home Territory might be considered as ouch, and that, although its abandonment might entail some risk, the whole art of warfare consisted in taking risks at the right moment.Although I do not think that any definite decision on the subject has been arrived at, I am informed that considerable numbers of men either already have, or will be, withdrawn from cycling units, artillery, etc., with a view to the constftutior. of 3. Divisions.4,      When I pointed out to Ilr. Lloyd George that we had been reduced to the employment of men drawn from The Auxiliary Military Service with Fighting Units, he replied that he considered it possible that the British Army had made more extensive use of female   labour than the French.   I thereupon informed him that French resources of female labour had been exploited to exhaustion, and that the reason more women were not employed by the French Army, was that none not already employed were available; our resources of female labour are in any case more limited, owing to the fact that half the French population is engaged in agriculture, and that in the absence of men, one half the women are consequently working on the land.   It is owing to their efforts that French- agriculture has been saved, to the common benefit of the Allies.
Net.a handed to Mr. Lloyd George on 17th, June, ,1918,French Army - Reserves available for the upkeep of the forces in the field in June, July, August, 1918.3u    Home and Colonial Reserves (Africa).On the 1st June, the total number of men in training and in the depots at home amounted to 376,474 out of which 229,155 belonged to the infantry,Thio number included about 220,000 men belonging to oombatanfrr-unito (inf. 140,000) who v/ere incorporated In April and will not Join the forces in the field before September,    The remainder represents a force of About 156,000 men^flnfc 89;000) which will either directly or by substitution maintain the armies in the field up to the 1st September,To this force should be added,1, About 20,000 men working factories who were to be sent to the line by the 1st June (This process was then in operation and must now &quot;be completed).2*   About 10,000 men who, it is hoped, . will be witkdrawn from the various home services and reyxaoed ty &amp; colonial personnel.3*   About 5,000 Moroccan tirailleurs,Total.- 191,000 men.IX.

Conclusion.If we complete the previous hypothesis by taking the number of dead, prisoners and missing to be 3R,000 men per month (this number suggest very active military operations, without allowing for an exceptionally high percentage of prisoners)   The following estimate can be drawn up for the months of June, July and August.

284APPfiNDIX TO THE REPORT SSNT. BY THE MISSIOIT ON Jtjg 21ST 1918^The statistical information required from the Ministry of National Servr.ce and from the War Office (some of which has not yet been received) can be divided into five categories.1.     Information concerning the employment of the present male population of Great Britain.2.     Information concerning the mobilised forces at present available in areat Britain,3.     Information concerning the distribution of the military forces amongst the fighting units, first line, and line of communication.4.     Information conoerning the waste and maintenance of effectives.5.     Information concerning thi distribution of contingents according to their physical ability.All this information is summarised in the enclosed tables, on which are placed opposite the British figures the corresponding figures relating to the French   forces.I -&quot;PRESENT SrlPLOYCTT CF Tig MALTii POPULATION OF ORSAT BRITAIN?The first table shows the employment of the 8, 375,-000 men actually living, who have been affected by the Recruiting Lawe of 1916 and have therefore been enrolled on the National Service register.These men are British subjects at present residing in England, Wales or Scotland, between the age of lo - 43, (lien bom in Great Britain but living in Ireland, in the Dominions and Colonies or who being abroad.escape the English reoruiting laws(l)The Ministry of National servioe is of the opinion that the total number of English, Welsh and scotch, of the   ago mentioned, have been registered,     If, indeed, the number of men of this age at present living in Great Britain are estimated taking for a basis the   census of 1911 - and calculating the increase in the population between 1911 and 1918 to be on the same scale as the average of the 10 preceding years, and taking into consideration losses owing to the war, a figure is obtained approximate to that of the number of m n registered,In adopting this method of calculation, the different causes which influence the fluctuation in population have been considered as being on the average the same between 1911 and 1918 a3 they were before 1911*     Of these causes, One of the most important is emigration which, in all, has reduced the number of men or military age by several hundreds of thousands.      The lors sustained in this way, according to the Kinistry of National Service, is rendered still more serious by the fact that most of the emigrants are strong men; consequently their departure lessens the percentage of r*n fit for octive service amongst those who remain.The(1)   On the other hand, if these men live in Canada, they are oalled up by the Canadian government, as conscription is in force there.

PRESENT EMPLOYMENT OF THE MOBILISED FORCES IN GREAT BRITAIN,The War Office has supplied certain data, relating to the distribution of the mobilised personnel in Great Britain between 1st March and 20th May, 191S.To understand these figures, they have been arranged in agreement with the authorized service at the War office in accordance with the principles followed in the case of the French effectives.     Therefore it has been possible to place side by side (Tables II and Ha) so as to be most easy for comparison figures relating to Great Britain on one hand, and to France, (personnel of the Home Services) on the other.These figures show that the number of unmobilised men in military employment at home up to the 1st March was (officers excluded)In Great Britain....... * 579,000 or 421,000&quot;   France. 412,000 01 317,000according to whether the effectives engaged in Home Defence and Surveillance are included in the personnel of the Home Services.Thus

The average number of men recruited for the army each month during 1916 and the first half of 1917 was $0,000 tc l0C,CCCv     This number thon diminished progressively until in Dece-ber 1917 it reached 25,000.From April IJlB) the number Increased and during this month and May, again reached a total of toO,tc 130,OCC men.The
The Ministry of National Service hopes that the number of incorporated men for the year 1918, will reach a total of 700 or cJ00,0C0.     in this total the young classes consist of 360,000 men (young men called up at lo exactly or after a short interval caused by adjournment or temporary exemption)*i2.    It must also be remarked that the Navy continuos to takb a large number of recruits from the new contingents.     So, out of the 308.OOO men who were incorporated from January to the end of May 1918, 32,500 went to the Navy.B* Total Forces jwhich have seen service during tho War.

The British leases including killed,- prisoners and missing are equal to about half the corresponding French losses.    On the other hand,the number of discharged men is greater in Groat Britain than in France. The number of discharged men reaches in Great Britain 14$ of the total number of men mobilised, lo6f0 of the total number of killed, missing and prisoners.

269Fart 11*Besides the general arguments which I have presented and discussed in the first part of this report, I had to state, in accordance with the object of my mission, the means employed in Prance in order to raise cur numbers to their full strength.with a view to military aims,     I giveVbciow the substance of my conversations concerning this part of my mission, treating first of the turning to account of available sources of&quot;recruiting, and secondly of the actual use of mobilized man-power.UTILIZATION OP SOURCES OP PECHTTlTIHGcIn Prance, it has been possible to regulate accurately and strictly the utilization of our resources of l-ian^power,because-, for forty years, military obligations had been defined in accordance-with age*    Thus a uniform military age was fixed in ordor to determine the number of the contingent at the disposal of the Military Authorities; some exceptions to the general rule also fixed according to age? were allowed, in consideration of greater family responsibilities, or of the staff requued in certain publis departments;   the   enforcement of this simple system and the checking of its application pre Equally eas$.; no one can escape, unless certlfioa as ootally unfit for service.    Again, successive revisions have still further reduced the number of mon within the fixed limits of age who remain outside the Army on account of health.in Great Britain, on the contrary, the rule as to age does not exist, and this question is only a side issue, occupation &amp; and physical fitness are more important considerations   Thus, there are men of all ages not mobilised, and when the Government decides to call up a certain contingent from amongst them the distribution must be fixed as follows:l.The number of men to be taken from each trade or calling. 2. The degree of fitness to whioh this levy shall be limited^ 3** The age limit defined for each professionWe recognize In this method the preponderating influence of industrial and economic interests, and it bears no trace&quot;of our conception of equality in the sacrifice for the country. Whilst, amongst us, every young man must be, not only mobilised, but actually on active service if he is physically fit, it is not considered astonishing in England to see young men fit for service placed in departments sheltered from danger, or remaining\. in civilian employments which are recognised as being of public importance, or the interest of which is simply protected.   Clearly.. it is considered that each man fulfils his duty absolutely by working just where he is placed f and neither any particular interest, no?*, doubtless, any special idea of honour is attached to a service in which he risks his life.    Moreover, the high rate of pay and the multiplicity of ranks are opposed to the idea that the military profession bears the stamp of disinterestednoss, which, amongst us, gives it a position apart from all others.Thus, if a certain proportion of the staff is called up from civilian occupations, this is not carried out on account of principle, but is due to the more rapid reduction in numbers of men on active service, so that it is necessary from time to time to readjust the balance; if, in such a case, a general appeal io addressed to the younger men, this is not by reason of a social rule, but because these men are usually less skilled in their work and also more capable of adapting themselves to a fresh mode of life.*he
270The Minister of National service thus needed an organization totally different from, ours in order to regulate the supply of manpower; as I have said, this organJj?r&amp;tion-liae&apos;&apos;* been admirably carried out; it is for the Government to make use of it, and for that purpose, it is sufficient to estimate beforehand the looses that will have to be made up.Must we attribute to an error in the estimates, or to difficulties of realisation the check in recruiting which occurred from September 1917 to March 1918, and which was evidently an unfortunate prelude to the operations of 1918? It seams now too late to seek the cause of this fact.    At present, the systenvis in full operation;   in spite of the falling-off at the beginning Of the year, it has furnished, from January 1st up to the present date 38O/OOO men; it is calculated that it will bring in about the 3ame number before the end of the year, and will realise, within a   short a time as possible, that part of the programme referring to the reclassification of exempted men,    We may hope that these resources will be sufficient for the maintenance of the full strength of the units, if the latter are immediately reinforcedv by other means.The measures taken by sir Auckland Geddes to improve the numerical result of recruiting rest upon the very extensive powers conferred upon him by tho new laws with regard to revision as to fitness for service and as to exemptions, After having made clear the definition of the classifications as to fitness, and regulated the working of Medical commissions,  &apos; the Ministry of National Service has undertaken the revision of all lists of men within the limits of age for mobilisation and not serving with the colours; this operation is not yet completed, but as it began with occupations from which it was possible preferably to call up some of the members, it has been capable of yielding immediate results.The limit as to numbers will be determined by the degree of sacrifice accepted as to economic supplies and as to industries working., directly or indirectly, for the war.It is difficult to make a comparative estimate of the requirements of labour, because a considerable part of the industries of the bnited Kingdom (mines, ship-building, maritime transport) must supply the needs of the Allies, Still, it is possible to arrive at an approximate valuation, by allowing that Great Britain should set aside for this work,of common interest, one million men within the age-limit for active service(l), a figure certainly-too high if we take into   I account all workers over 42 years of a,je, and Irish labour; however; after deduction of thio million in favour of the United Kingdom, a comparison cf the employment of man-power works cut as fellows (showing distribution of 1,000 men of an age below the former limit.)&apos; United(1).    In this report, the age-limit for active service is I taken as being 42 years, since the application of the recent law to men of 43-50 years of age has scarcely begun and   does not affect statistics.

Other more serious difficulties arise from the unreasonable demands of the organisations of workmen, which are absolutely opposed to the introduction of foreign or colonial labour; even the employment of prisoners of war has been a difficult . matter to enforoe.     It might appear as if the labouring class -that very important section of the British population - is taking no interest in the war.     I have certainly been informed that the output of labour has shown a slight.increase ,since 1914, but it is scarcely probable th-t a comparison as to production, if mado, would be in favour of England.     The habits of peace-time have been retained; the appeal made to the ,workers, at the moment of the German offensive, to sacrifice their East r holiday, met with but slight success.Horeover, as a general rule, it   does not appear that the British nation as a whole takes a more intense interest in the present war than in the great colonial expeditions which render its history illustrious; it does not yet look upon the war do a great national taok involving vital consequencoo.   This explains the peculiar features that surprise us in the distribution of the burdens of service and the degrev of reserve shewn in the national effort.    Doubtless, it would be adifferent(l) Still, the Admiralty, controlling the building of merchant vessels *as well as wardships, does not seem prepared for any sacrifice of v-orkero; on the contrary, ,,-e kno,n th*t. it was decided in March to recall 20,000 soldiers to the nival dock-yirdo.
different matter if this nation had experienced the sufferings of an invasion; we may suppose that their whole conception of military duty would be transformed by it.     I have heard the following question put (outside Government circles,naturally)j &quot;Are you satisfied with what our country is doing for y^urs?&quot; Without forgetting the gratitude we owe to the Brill ah people for their decision of August 4, 1514, or the praice due for adapting themselves to conditions so novel to them, we cannot help at this time comparing the amount of sacrifices accepted for the sake of our common cause, and asking ourselves whether our Ally understands that we also have done something for her.There is no doubt,&apos; however, that a large number of intelligent persons have a sound judgment upon these matters, and consider the war as an affair oi equal importance to both, countries,.     But how can we explain the feet that campaigns in the Press and by means of speeches oan be carried on uncontxadicted. clearly intended to deceive the British nation as to the extent of its sacrifices, and thus to lead it to suppose that jts effort made is sufficient, and that now the chief burden should fall upon America.     Doubtless the Government have seen this danger, but perhaps they have not understood soon enough the harm there might be just now in allowing the expression of such semiments to reach the ears of the public in prance.However this may be,, if we keep to the region of present facts, we may note with satisfaction the advanced point reached in the programme of recruiting for 1918.     The rapid and thorough application of this scheme will be an effective reply to those who are advising a smaller effort.It should especially cut short the discussions raised by tho application of tho terms of the new law. which extends the obligation of military service to men between the ages of 42 and 51i    Uen to the number of a million and a half are to be examined, classified and attached to certain units.    Doubtless, a large number of them should be retained in the exercise of their office or occupation as a part of the Army reserves, but, being under orders,, which allow of their removal from place to place, their output should be increased, and the levies of younger men facilitated.Again, it does not appear to be the intention of the Government that men so incorporated should be employed for com*   * batant service, but certainly as substitutes for those already engaged in various military departments, this is of little importance, provided they release fighting men.;&apos;,I have said above that the total scheme of incorporation up to the close of the year admitted of an estimate of about 380,000 men.     Deducting from this figure about 180,000 men of theVouhg classes, there remain 200,000  or the older Classes.-    ene might think that the new law should yield a higher total, and consequently, that its application will not be brought to a close with &quot;the year 1918.     If circumstances should make it desirable, we might ask the British Government to hasten the operation.
