Cfltoei *. Dully Jones.\4 / eX-is the PronWAR CABINET.llo/Gen.No./l220.Absorption into the Array of the 65rd (Royal Naval) Division,Memorandum byThe Secretary of State for War.In the Fourth Report from the Select Committee on national Expenditure, paragraphs 12 - 16, a surest ion is made that the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division, should be merged into the Army.   The grounds nut forward by tho Select Committee for thin proposal areThat the men of this Division are paid at Naval rates:That prior to the grant of the recent pay and allotment concessions to the Army and Navy, R.N.D. men cost on the average more than the soldier.   These concessions have altered the position, and placed the two Services more on an equality.The present position of the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division, now in France, is that out of tho 9 Infantry Battalions forming the Division, 5 only are Naval, (l Royal Marine L,I., and 4 Ships&apos; Battalions.)From an Ar;ry point of view the abolition of this Division as a Naval formation would bo wolcomod, for tho following reasons(a) The difficulty of obtaining a supply of R.N..V.R. recruits, as such men must volunteer, and cannot be posted compulsorily as men raised by National Service, and the supply is irregular and cannot be relied on:(b) The complications involved in tho administrative details of the Division.   This is a real difficulty, and undoubtedly leads to considerable waste of time in clerical work which might be avoided:(c) A waste of man-power, in. that drafts for the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division cannot in emergency be made use of for other than Naval Units:(d) The Artillery, Engineers, Field Ambulances, and other auxiliary services of tho Divicion are Army Units.If it be decided that this Division shall be incorporated in the Army, the change would not be made until the coming winter.   The Marine L.I. Battalion would be re-transferred to the Navy, and men in tho Ships&apos; Battalions would be asked to volunteer for service in the Army, and those who were not prepared to do so would be discharged, and be available to be called up by National Service under the Military Service Acts.27th July, 1918.MILKER.
