Chemists in the Dy&amp;41aking Industry and Military Service.1 This Document is the Propertyu308^Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.In January last the War Cabinet, on the recommendation&apos; of the Economic Offensive Committee, approved a number of measures proposed bv the Board of Trade for the promotion of the Dye-making Industry.  These proposals included one to the effect that chemists and chemical engineers at present employed in dye-manufacturing works should be exempt from Military Service, and that on application of the Board of Trade trained chemists already in the Army should be allowed to return to their occupations in Dye Works.The Minister of National&apos; Service lias recently issued an instruction to the following effect:-nThe War Cabinet have decided that all men born in the years 1898 and 1899 who come under the recent Government Order are to be called up forthwith for Military Service, if Grade 1, irrespective of the effect upon output or of the work upon which they are engaged.This decision does not affect men in occupations inthe Schedule for which the age limit is 19.If protest is made by employers they should be informed that these men are bein^ released by order of the War Cabinet and that there is no appeal against the decision.wI understand that there is some possibility tfyat thisthe years 1895-1897 inclusive.Certain men born in the years 1898 and 1899 employed in dye-making works and important thereto by reason of their special training have already been called up under the new instruction.  Should the instruction be further extended the result will be a very serious interference with the industry, as a considerable number of men would be affected, that is meii11instruction may be extended at no distant date to men-tforn inwho
309who have undergone or are undergoing special training and have become or are becoming of essential importance to the industry.Th* number of men affected is approximately 66, viz., 26 men&quot;bom in 1898 and 1899, and 40 men born in 1895-7.It will be recalled that the reason for according exemption to chemists employed in dye manufacture was the consideration that H.M.Government would be gravely hampered in the peace negotiations if this country were still de-pendent on Germany for the supply of so vitally necessary a material, and that one of the most serious difficulties in rendering ourselves independent was the dearth of trained chemists.In view of this and of the fact that the number of men who will be affeared by the New Instruction and any eztensi of it, though considerable in relation to the total number of chemists engaged in the industry, is quite insignificant from the point of view of Military Service, I strongly urge that the decision taken by the V/ar Cabinet in January last should be re-affirmed and that the Instruction in question should not be applied to this particular manufacture and that the men already called up should be returned from the Army iA; H. STANLEY.BOARD Of TRADE, 1st August, 1918.
