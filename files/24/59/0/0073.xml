This document is the property of Ms Britannic K*jesty1-3 GovernmentsWAR    CABINET.Allied interchange of views on War Aimsfl.T.5273.and League of letions.Memo by Mr. Geo, II. B*rnes.I venture to put in a Memo, on the above, being induced to do so by reeding the communications which have passed &quot;between Colonel House and Lord Robert Cecil, (G.T.5256) with the further telegram from Lord Reading of the 24th.instant,(No.3354).   X have further in my mind, the renewed efforts which sre being made just now by the Labour Party, and the Socialist parties on the Continent, to revive the question of a Stockholm Conference.    ^he federation of Labour in France has just adopted a resolution, making suppoirt? of the war, dependent upon passports being granted for Stockholm, The French &quot;Minority&quot; Socialists have at last, after three years struggle, been transformed into a &quot;Majority&quot;.   Longuet, who is the leader of the Minority Socialists, ha? obtained 1544 votes, as against 1172 for the motion of Rene$del, the Majority Socialist,in the National Socialist Council.The Labour P*rty here, I know, is in communication with thoie who are of like mind, and have at their elbow all the time, Mr.Huysmons, who is Secretary of the International Bureau **nd is in touch with all the elements on the Continent who are pushing the Stockholm Conference once more, to the front.     I suggest that **n inter-Allied Conference would be a good set-off as against stock-holm,, and I suggest further that, in the&quot; event sf such an inter-Allied Conference being convened, representatives of Labour, and possibly of Religion and Commence, might be invited to take part. I note that President Wilson urges that there should be full opportunity for interchange of views on the matter, *nd is engaged on a paper regarding the Phillimore Report.    Lord Robert Cecil also apparently assumed a Conference, and that the Phillimore Report may be taken as a basis of discussion with the Allies.   But in the meantime, nothing is being done, end the outside agitstion proceeds apace.    We shall be faced one of these d/ays with ft re-newed demand for passp&amp;rts for discussion with enemy subjects. Why not now torpedo suoh an citation by convening an inter-Allied Conference to discuss questions outstanding, i neluding those which have been the subject of papers by Mr.Bal ourr General Smuts and Lord curzon, in regard to territorial readjustments;   and also the terms upon which the Allied nations could come together, forming the nucleus of a League of Nations:     It seems to me that nothing but good could result therefrom, and it would promote the settlement of many questions between the Allies upon which it is desirable to b*ve agreement before the time when the peace conference comes.(Initialled)    G.   H.   B.2, Whitehall Gardens,S.W....131st, July 1918.
