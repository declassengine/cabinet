Memorandum, Germany/006] that the political and business minds of Germany are at present concentrating upon the resumption of her overseas trade. Though time and thought have also been devoted to the development of Mittel-Europa, it has been increasingly recognised that the fruits of the scheme cannot be reaped, nor can a firm foundation be laid for Germany&apos;s ambitions of world-wide dominion, until the Central Powers are secure at sea; until they once again have freedom for their overseas traffic, and have re-established that trade domination which will enable them to prepare for the next war.It is the object of the present memorandum to examine the position and prospects of German sea-power, first, as to - naval acquisitions and aims; secondly, as to the expansion of the mercantile marine, and its part in the reconstruction of German trade.The matter has been treated under the following heads :-I. (a.) The acquisitions and aims which affect the future of Germany!s sea-power. (6.) The reconstruction and expansion of her mercantile marine and its part in the resumption of her commerce abroad.II. A detailed account of the present position of her mercantile marine, and the various enterprises with which its reconstruction is intimately connected.I. (a.) Germany&apos;s Acquisitions and Aims.Nothing could better indicate the respective attitudes of the two belligerent groups than a study of the recent speeches and writings of their public men. On the one hand, the Entente Powers are searching for the most effective methods of settling international disputes without a resort to arms. On the other hand, Lieutenant-General Baron von Freytag-Loringhoven, Chief of the Deputy General Staff, is exhorting his countrymen to trust the future of the Fatherland to their glorious army and&apos; their belaurelled young fleet; Admiral von Tirpitz has declared that the present submarine warfare will be outdone in ferocity by that of the future; Admiral voii Capelle has already stated that for several years there must be no abatement of the delivery of new submarines ; Count Westarp, the Conservative leader in the Reichstag, desires to have in hand as many U-boats as possible at the time of the peace negotiations, and asserts that Germany is not prepared to enter into any discussion which tends to limit her naval programme.[367-30]B
2The experience ofthe present war has not destroyed her avowed ambition to attain a greater measure of naval supremacy ; and has taught Germany various lessons. It is true that if the submarine is left out of account, the gates of the North Sea and of the Straits of Gibraltar and Otranto have been closed against the German and Austrian fleets ; save for the furtive clash of an occasional raider, the mercantile marine has been compelled to inactivity. But during the past four years Germany has not wholly failed in her purpose. Inside those gates the development of German sea-power is far from negligible, and those who make the peace will have to reckon with her acquisitions. Antwerp, Ostend, and Zeebrugge are handsome &quot; pawns.&quot; As von Bethmann-Hollwfio&apos; himself admitted to Sir Edward Goschen in Julv 1914, the retention by Germany of the Belgian coast would practically destroy the independence of the Netherlands. Were Germany to retain Antwerp and Zeebrugge, she would develop her inland waterways on some well-considered plan, and would, possess a continuous control of the waters from Jutland to Dunkirk.As a result of Russia&apos;s defection, the Baltic Sea has become a German preserve. At the present time all Norwegian and Swedish vessels proceeding to Russia must obtain a permit from the German Legation before passing the German naval, controls ; even then they are subjected to inordinate delays. Since the gate of the Baltic is closed, the Arctic routes to northern Russia, formerly an annexe of the Allies, have acquired greater importance. [SeeP.I.D. Memorandum on Finland/002.] Finland is now a vassal State, her vast resources are in German hands, and commercial and shipping agreements have already been exchanged. The railroad from Petrograd to the Arctic Ocean was originally laid down for the use of the British and French Governments, and for the export of enormous supplies of ore and timber. Even if Finland fails to yield entirely to German influence, there is a danger that she might connive at the use of the great road to Petschenga, since Germany&apos;s employment of the Limburg railway could be taken as a precedent. Now that the present rulers of Russia have ceded to Finland a strip of territory on the Murmansk coast, it is the aim of Germany to obtain an ice-free port, either Petschenga or Kola, as an additional base for submarines,, a scheme which the Allies are preparing to frustrate.The reqent acquisition of. the Russian Black Sea fleet will no doubt improve the position of the Central Powers in the Eastern Mediterranean. Despite Trotskfs protests and promises the defection of Russia has placed the bulk of these ships at the enemy s disposal, though the want of efficient crews will delay the use of the various vessels. It is possible, however, that the Germans will be able to establish a yard for submarine construction and repair at Nicolaiev, where the plant is practically undamaged. They have, in any case, established a new centre for their activities, both naval and commercial,,. It is their hope&apos;that, under normal conditions, trade will follow the flag, and if the Turkish, Government should prove amenable (though this is by no means certain), the Central Powers will be enabled to strengthen their control of the Black Sea, to develop the commercial, possibilities ofthe Middle East, and to hold a set of valuable concessions in readiness for the peace negotiations.When she considers the defects of her present strategical position, it is only natural that Germany&apos;s war-aims should be directed towards future developments, and by a skilful use of &quot;freedom ofthe seas,&quot; or of &quot;self-determination,&quot; she might conceivably attain her ends, &quot;The freedom ofthe seas,&quot; said Stresemann, frankly, &quot; means the ! abolition of EnglancVs single control of so many naval bases.&quot; In 1899, the voyage of Prince Hemy&apos;s jleet to China provided him with an object lesson in the unbroken chain of British naval power : Gibraltar, Malta, Suez, Aden, Colombo, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Since Germany&apos;s need for stations outside the North Sea and the Mediterranean &apos; is urgent, she will aim at the retention, of Kaio-Chau, Samoa, New Guinea; and all her Pacific Islands. In view of the potentialities of the submarine, she will desire to rebuild her wireless stations and expand her bases in German East Africa, where a fleet of the great airships of the future could also be stationed. She.is already casting envious eyes upon the&apos; Azores, the Cape Verde, and the Faroe Islands, while she conceives that when the &quot;freedom ofthe seas&quot; is under discussion, matters such as the neutralisation of the, Straits, of Gibraltar could be brought up, at a Peace Conference.,. At the present time there,is much speculation among the pan-Germans upon the future of the; jSuez Canal. Their view is, that should a prolongation of the war give indecisive results in the West, the German, Turkish, and Bulgarian armies, would prepare to, sweep away our men in Palestine and Mesopotamia, and press on towards the Suez.Canal. f; They are, already elaborating vast schemes for the control of Central Asia by way of the Caucasus, Turkestan, Afghanistan, and Persia; and the reconquest of Egypt is made the principal Germano-Turkish war-aim.   Though these projects are at
present in the air, we can ill afford to contemplate any danger, however remote, to the &quot;spinal cord of the British Empire.&quot;I.-(6.) The Resumption of Overseas Trade.Formidable as these various acquisitions and aspirations may appear, they lack the permanent sanction of a peace conference; and since Germany feels a ssnse of insecurity, she is eagerly endeavouring to ensure her future&apos; development upon the high seas. In order to compass this end, the reconstruction of her mercantile marine and the development of her harbours and inland waterways, have become matters of instant necessity.Considerable preparations have already been made. The Reichstag has passed an Act, which provides for. an extensive shipbuilding programme, enables the various companies to sell their ships to the Government, and to charter&apos; them again, on condition that the purchase-money is used for further construction. Numerous yards have been built, and it is estimated that 950,000 tons of new shipping, from the largest liners down to the smallest tramps, are now completed or are on the stocks. The bonds between finance, industry, and shipping have been strengthened, and as the Germans consider that Lloyds has been a powerful factor in the economic war between England and Germany, they intend to establish a rival institution at Hamburg, in order to render their marine intelligence independent of London.Though precedence is given to the reconstruction of the mercantile marine, large sums have also been expended upon the development of canals and waterways, especially those which connect Germany and her neighbours.   The schemes include : (a.) A series of waterways linking the Rhine to Belgium, Holland, and Alsace-Lorraine, which would facilitate the transport of mineral deposits from Longw)?- or Briey, and which as von Kuhlmann recently hinted, endangers the independence of the Netherlands.(6.) The complete canalisation of the Danube, in order to obtain the fullest advantages from Rumania, the Balkan States and the South of Russia.(c.) A plan for utilising the water-power of Switzerland,, improving her connections with the Central Powers, and eventually enabling the German system to establish a link with the Rhone-Mediterranean Canal.As far as a mercantile marine is concerned, the .Germans are well aware that our powers of expansion are infinitely greater, and they are now demanding such conditions as will enable them to meet us on&apos; equal terms. Herr Heye, the President of the Hamburg Chamber uf Commerce, has formulated peace aims for the capital of Germany&apos;s shipping world : he demands (a.) The restoration of the German colonies (in which he is supported by Dr. Solf,the Colonial Secretary). (6.) The &quot;freedom of the seas&quot; (i.e., unrestricted liberty of movement for Germanshipping), (c.) Favourable commercial treaties. (cZ.) The withdrawal of any economic boycott, (e.) The abolition of all restrictive regulations upon German trade.Herr Huldermann, the managing director of the Hamburg-America Line, has added the following provisions : (a.) Compensation for the expropriation and employment of German ships by , hostile countries.(6.) The restoration in overseas territories of all premises formerly occupied byGerman shipping and commerce, (c.) Adequate compensation for all losses suffered by German trade abroad.In order to gain these ends German diplomacy will exploit every possible means. &quot; No annexations&quot; will be used to compass the restoration of the German colonies, where wireless installations and submarine bases will be prepared for future warfare. &quot; No indemnities&quot; will be freely used for the preservation of her finances, though, fortunately for the Allies, Germany has shown in her treaty with Rumania, a subtlety of interpretation which may react to her own hindrance. As in 1856, the &quot; freedom of the seas &quot; will be brought forward in order to whittle away the sea-power of the British
4Empire. In addition, Germany will endeavour to gain an adequate portion of raw materials, and, as Herr Ballin suggests, would be prepared to persuade a &quot;League of Nations&quot; to divide their stock upon the basis of 1913 for her economic advantage.The German shipowners are, however, alive to the possibility of a &quot; counter-offensive &quot; on the part of the Allied diplomatists.   They have to face : (a.) The possibility of an economic boycott for a term of years.(b.) The possibility of a joint shipbuilding and tonnage agreement by some of the Allied Powers (e.g,, Great. Britain, the Dominions and America, with France and Italy) on the lines of the Allied agreements which at present regulate imports.(c.) The raising of harbour and canal dues against German shipping, and thecontrol of coaling stations. (d.) The resumption of the principle of the Navigation Acts, (e.) Unofficial measures by seamen, clock labourers, warehouse owners, &amp;c.In the memorandum previously quoted [P.I.D. Germany /006] it has been fully shown to what extent the German shipowners fear the economic boycott. In order to meet the shortage of raw material they have, in apprehensive fashion, instructed neutrals, particularly the Swiss and the Dutch, to purchase the yield of mines and plantations and to store various raw materials in places like Shanghai and the Dutch East Indies. Though using her neighbours for her own ends, and with the least possible expense, Germany is somewhat fearful of neutral competition, especially during the transition period, and she is preparing to attract additional cargo space by providing bunker coal, on lengthy contracts, to Holland and Scandinavia. Despite their heavy losses neutral shipowners are in a strong position; for the increase in their receipts, consequent upon the high freights, has enabled them to make huge profits, which will be available for further expansion. And while Germany deplores the requisition of neutral tonnage by the Allied Powers, she displays sufficient reliance upon our good faith to believe that when peace is declared the vessels will promptly be returned to their owners.As far as her overseas trade is concerned, Germany can hardly expect an immediate resumption of activity. At the present time her irrevocable losses account for half of her mercantile marine, and if the vessels interned and sheltering in neutral ports are included, she has lost two-thirds. When peace is declared an immediate use of her full resources will be impracticable ; her newer vessels will need proper equipment; the interned and inactive vessels will be incredibly foul after their four years of detention, and it will be impossible to dock them quickly, or to provide them with crews, provisions, and bunker coal. In addition, all calculations as to reconstruction are rendered more difficult owing to the uncertainties which are bound to prevail as to (a) the price of raw material; (b) the cost of labour. * Despite the assistance ofthe Government, there will be a considerable strain upon the capital and funds of the larger shipping companies. The lines which relied upon overseas trade have made no profits during the war, and have had to meet enormous expenses. The Hamburg-America Line estimates its daily losses at a stupendous sum, and its payment upon debentures entails a heavy expen-diture. All the companies will have to face a considerable reduction of receipts ; during the period of reconstruction the passenger traffic will be.small, the steerage will lack a full complement of emigrants, and the freightage upon exports will be far from a paying concern. Georg Beriihard, a reliable authority, estimates that ten years will have expired before the equilibrium is restored. &quot;Yorwarts&quot; regards the present position of German shipping as serious, and the future uncertain, &quot; especially in view of the threatened economic war against Germany on the part of the Entente, which appears likely to become a reality.&quot;The various difficulties which Germany must needs face, give to her rivals an advantage which should cause them to redouble their efforts. She, on the other hand, may have reckoned upon our handicaps : the strain which will be placed upon our shipping by the problems of an extensive demobilisation, and by the diverse and incon-testable claims of our Allies. We are bound to repatriate and to feed thousands of Belgians; we are bound in honour to refurnish and to repopulate Serbia. But great as our task may appear, the collective shipping of this Empire and her Allies should be equal to the strain if foresight is coupled with organisation.* &quot; Vorwlirts &quot; (2nd July, 1918) estimates that the cost of ship construction has risen 300-350 per cent,, and is likely to remain at this figure after the war.
5304II.-The Reconstruction of the Mercantile Marine.The Mercantile Marine in 1914.At/ the outbreak of war Germany&apos;s mercantile marine was estimated at 2,888 vessels, with a capacity of 5,459,296 tors. The Hamburg-America Line could boast the largest tonnage (1,168,000) and the largest vessel (&quot; Vaterland,&quot; 54,282 tons) of any line in the world ; while the North German Lloyd was the only other line to exceed 750,000 tons. Between 1901 and 1911 her tonnage had increased by 60 per cent., and the clearances in Hamburg had increased by 7&apos;2 per cent. [Professor Bernhard Harms, &quot; Deutschlands Anteil an Welthandel und Weltschiffahrt,&quot; 1916.] Generously subsidised by the German Government, the Hansa, the Hamburg-South American, the Deutsche-Australische, the Deutsche-Ost-Afrika, the Kosmos, and the Woerman Lines were formidable competitors against our steamship companies: the Hansa Line had in two cases been admitted to our shipping combines. [Report of the Royal Commission on Shipping Rings, 1909, Cd. 4668.]Efforts to replace her Losses.Considerable losses have been sustained by Germany; at the present time 880 vessels, with a tonnage of 2,720,000 tons, have been irrevocably lost, and 330, with a tonnage of 1,106,000 tons, have been interned or are sheltering in neutral ports.In order to meet these losses, with a view to the resumption of overseas trade, Germany and her allies have displayed considerable activity in various directions, which will be dealt with under the following heads:-(a.) The Bill of 1917 for the reconstruction of the German mercantile marine.ib.) The closer connection between finance, industry, and shipping.(c.) The expansion of German yards.(d.) The standardisation of construction.(e.) The development of a shipbuilding programme.(/.) Expansion with German capital among various neutrals.(g.) The improvement of the European waterways.(a.) The Reconstruction Programme.During 1917 the Reichstag was occupied in framing legislation for the reconstruc-tion of the mercantile marine. Providing in the first instance for an expenditure of 50,000,OOOL towards building new tonnage, the Germans soon increased this to 80,000,0001. The Act also provides for the purchase of all merchant vessels by the Government on the following terms ; (a.) That the ships are chartered to their respective companies at moderate rates. (6.) That the purchase-money shall be used for building further vessels.^ -Such a measure could hardly be passed without considerable criticism, and may be subjected to certain alterations. Various other interests complained of the special favour shown to shipping and demanded similar advantages, while the Socialists protested against the principle and the expense of compensating industries from public funds. The Bill had a severe and weighty critic in Herr Ballin, who, in the columns of the &quot; Neue Freie Presse,&quot; expressed the view that the tonnage question would play a subordinate part in &quot;transition economics&quot; (&quot; Uebergangswirtschaft&quot;), and claimed for German and Austrian shipping the greatest amount of freedom from the temporary restrictions which will be placed upon the trade and industry of the Central Powers.&quot; Shipping is an industry,&quot; he said, &quot; which at the very first moment is capable of working and of earning, and the more rapidly and freely it resumes its old labours the more effectively can it contribute to the good of the community. To put upon it any more fetters than are absolutely necessary would be to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. ... I need not enlarge,&quot; he concludes, &quot; upon the fact that the most useful means of developing our activity after the war is to be found in the encouragement of our* See also &quot;Syren and Shipping&quot; (3rd July, 1918): &quot;The essential feature of the Law is that the State reimburses the owner of a captured, seized, or destroyed ship to the value of the ship at the outbreak of war, on condition that the money is reinvested in shipping after the war, and also agrees to pay a proportion of the cost of the new ship in excess of the pre-war value.&quot;[367-30] C
6exports on large lines. Nothing but greatly increased exports can restore our completely disorganised exchanges to normal conditions.&quot;Owing to this undercurrent of dissatisfaction, 175 members of the Reichstag recently visited Hamburg, in order to attend a series of lectures arranged by the shipping community. All the speakers laid stress upon the resumption of overseas trade, and the discussion resolved itself into a demonstration in favour of free control, as against the State control of shipping. Herr Withoefft, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, was especially vigorous, and his speech was loudly applauded. He is reported to have said that the authorities in Berlin ignored the existence of Hamburg and Bremen ; that the continuation of the war economic-system would mean the ruin of German trade, since the world trade, which rested on the basis of supply and demand, could not bear such bonds. If Germany, he concluded, overdid the principle of mechanisation after the war, there would, despite all laws, be a flight of trade abroad and unparalleled misery in Germany.*(b.) The Relations of Finance and Shipping.One of the most significant features of German industrial development during recent months is the intimate connection which has been established between the shipping, banking, and industrial concerns, and the tendency of big industrial and financial groups to coalesce in the national interest. A powerful combination has already been formed : the Hamburg-America and North German Lloyd represent shipping, the Diskonto-Gesellschaft represents banking, the Westphalian iron industry is prepared to provide the raw material, and this comprehensive ring is completed by the adhesion of the great firm of Krupp, with its manifold resources for finance and manufacture. In view of the necessary reduction of armaments which peace is bound to bring, Krupps directors determined, to divert a portion of their capital, material, machinery, and man-power to the construction of mercantile shipping. The share-holders voted some 500,0001. to acquire shares in the Hamburg-America and North German Lloyd for the construction of new yards and the purchase of extensive interests in neutral shipping companies, while the firnfs prestige and power enable them to appoint agents who have the advantage of the direction and advice of the German naval attaches.Other- amalgamations have been devised and organised. Herr Thyssen and Herr Hugo Stinnes, the greatest coal and iron magnates in Westphalia, have acquired considerable interests in the Hamburg-America and North German Lloyd; and the latter has become a director of the Hamburg-America Line. Herr von Gwinner, of the Deutsche Bank, and Dr. Salomonsohn, of the Diskonto-Gesellschaft have also joined the board of directors. The results of this intimate connection between the financial and shipping concerns was shown when the Deutsche Bank superintended the reconstruction of the Bavarian Lloyd Navigation Company. In addition a new banking company with a capital of 500,O00L has recently been formed, with the specific object of furthering the shipping interests.Another powerful syndicate has extended its operations to the purchase of various companies which import British coal. Considerable sums have been spent upon storage facilities, coal-discharging plants, and a fleet of colliers. In addition, certain firms have been enabled to increase their capital: Blohm and Yoss have raised their total from 600,0001. to 1,000,000L; Howaldtfs, of Kiel, from 205,0001. to 500,0001 ; Jansen and Schmilinsky&apos;s from 15,000L to ten times that amount.(c.) The Expansion of German Yards.At the outbreak of war, Germany possessed twenty-two ship-building yards, and since then fourteen have been planned: some of these are nearly ready, and &quot; Vorwarts &quot; states that seven additional vards are under consideration. Three have been constructed at Liibeck, and two yards on the left bank of the Oder at Stettin; one for merchant ships of 6,000 tons and upwards, the other for &quot; construction in series.&quot; The most recent venture is a new yard at Hamburg, which is likely to become one of the largest of such undertakings in Germany, and is especially designed for building oil-tank steamers for the trade with Rumania; the provisional capital of the company amounts to 10,000,000 M., provided in part by the Hamburg-America Line. At the same time the Norder ship-building yard has been acquired by the Elbe Ship-building Yard Company, and the capital of 2,500,000 M. is to be furnished by three private banks.* For the British view see Report of the Royal Commission on Shipping, &amp;c, Cel. 9092, p. 01.
7(d.) The Standardisation of Construction.The Norder yard is designed for the simultaneous construction of several vessels up to 1,200 tons, and two yards now under construction are to be prepared for standard ships, a policy strongly advocated by W. Kreul, in a recent number of &quot;Stahlund Eisen.&quot; Two years ago, however, Herr Ballin planned a new yard at Hamburg for the &quot; quick series construction&quot; of freight steamers, which had hitherto been a speciality of English yards, and the yard at Stettin, mentioned in the previous paragraph, was designed for the &quot;construction in series&quot; of vessels graded at 4,000, 7,000, and 10,000 tons.(e.) The Development of a Shipbuilding Programme.Apart from standardised ships considerable activity has been displayed in other directions. In 1916 the Hamburg-America Line constructed the &quot;Bismarck&quot; (56,000 tons), the &quot; Tirpitz &quot; (32,000&apos;tons), while three others of 22,000 tons each were on the stocks. At Danzig the North German Lloycl placed orders for two vessels each of 35,000 tons, christened the &quot; Hindenburg&quot; and the &quot;Columbus.&quot; In addition twelve vessels of 12,000 tons, and two of 16,000 were in course of construction during 1916. At Flensburg, on the east coast of Schleswig, three large vessels were completed, and at Geestenmunde (Bremen) two freight steamers of 17,000 tons have been built for special traffic through the Panama Canal. The Hamburg South America Line is building the &quot;Cap Polonia&quot; of 19,000 tons, and four other vessels of 18,000 tons each. The Vulcan Yard at Bremen was engaged on nine vessels of 18,000 tons, which will be the largest freight steamers in the world. The Bremen-Ahm-ia Line has ordered six steamers, the Hansa Line eight, and the Kosrnos Line has ten under construction; all vessels ranging from 9,000 to 13,000 tons. At Toning, in Schleswig-Holstein, fifteen new steamers (55,000 tons in all), are in preparation for the reinforcement of the Dutch and Norwegian coasting lines, which have suffered severe losses through submarine warfare. It is estimated by the Germans that 950,000 tons are now being built for their principal lines alone, but it is not improbable that the larger liners are incom-pletely furnished, and that some portion of the estimated tonnage has been quoted in order to impress the neutral mind, for it is known that many of the orders placed in 1914 have not been completed, while the construction of standard ships, not only at Hamburg, but at Danzig and Stettin, has been held up by the preference given to Government work, and every available hand is employed on destroyers, light cruisers, and submarines.Expansion in Austria and Turkey.While building her own vessels, Germany&apos;s enterprise has been active among her Allies. Since the yards of San Rocco and the Cantiere Navale have been found insufficient for the equipment of Austria&apos;s mercantile marine, new berths are in process - of construction at Spalato, on the coast of Dalmatia. Both the Austrian-Lloyd and the Trieste Shipping Company are increasing their fleets, and modernising their ship-building centres.With such possibilities of expansion Austria&apos;s shipping will not necessarily suffer to any great extent,from the wear and tear of the war, and she will doubtless be com-pelled tc assist her neighbour. Her losses have been slight, and it was calculated that if peace were now declared she would command a cargo-space of 900,000 tons over and above 120.000 tons now in process of construction. The Act of 1907 to subsidise shipping has been extended until 1920. Her Government has shown sufficient con-fidence in her stability to refuse an offer by Krupps for the purchase of a number of shares in the Austrian-Lloyd, and has decreed that no such shares are to be sold outside Austria-Hungary, an indication that Vienna, despite a closer military union, may desire some remnant of independence. There is a fair amount of evidence to show that the future foundations of Austrian shipping have been well and truly laid. A powerful combination has been formed for administrative, but not for trading purposes; the various shipyards have submitted their programme to the Austrian-Lloyd, and are working in combination with that company. Arrangements have already been made to divide the existing shipping federations into tAvo organisations; the first to control all liners, and the second all tramp-steamers. Thanks to the heavy demand made by the military authorities upon the Austrian-Lloyd, the 1917 report is satisfactory; the company&apos;s securities are said to represent, at their present market quotations, a much higher figure than their book value, and this accounts for the firmness of the shares, which are quoted on the Bourse at 540 per cent.
8The Turkish Government, inspired by their Allies, have also determined to build up a national mercantile marine. Previous to the war the Mahsusse Company was in financial straits, but the debt of 300,0001 sterling has now been paid off; 380,0001 has been expended upon small passenger and cargo vessels, and after the war the company is to be converted into a large shipping company of the most modern type. An Austro-Hungarian syndicate is constructing a new harbour at Stambul, with a quay 4,000 metres in length, equipped with a clearing-house, railway lines, and the most modern accessories, while the harbour is to be deepened so as to contain the largest vessels. Since 1914 several new steamers have been constructed in Germany for the Shirket-Haireh Company, whose receipts in 1916-17 amounted to upwards of 10,000,000L from passenger traffic, and 9,000,001. from other sources. It is not, however, certain that Turkey will acquiesce permanently in German supervision, though the activities and capital of Krupps have succeeded in obtaining a hold on the reconstruction of Turkish shipping.(f.) Germany and the Neutrals.Among the neutral nations German enterprise has been extraordinarily active. Considerable capital has been invested in various neutral shipping companies, in order that the German shareholders may obtain control after the war, while the sale to neutrals of shares in the Hamburg-America and North German-Lloyd has been prohibited.One of the larger enterprises of the war is the establishment of a ship-building yard at Landskrona, on the Swedish shore of the Sound. Though nominally a neutral yard it is the creation of German money and brains, and designed to serve German interests. The ubiquitous Herr Ballin has provided the capital, tools and material; a German engineer is in charge of the work, and Herr Fritsch, the German consul, exercises the general supervision. The responsibility for the expenditure falls on a Dane, who is on the black list; and the pro-German firm of N. C. Monberg has the contract for dredging the harbour.Though the northern neutrals have reaped certain benefits from German enterprise, the benefits have been balanced by exacting demands. Sweden lies between the hammer and the anvil, and though she has obtained the material with which to expand her yards and build her vessels, all such material is subject to rigid control. Each concession of German steel is coupled with irksome restrictions. All vessels which are manufactured with this material, purchased at a high price, are forbidden to trade with the Entente ports before the end of the war, and Germany has declared her intention of controlling the movements ofthe vessels for a further five years.Holland is in no better plight. &apos; The port of Rotterdam is compelled to endure the presence of German agents: Hoppe for the Hamburg-America, and Galatzer for the North German Lloyd, two men whose business it is to &quot; inspect &quot; the traffic.A powerful syndicate of coal merchants, subsidized by the German Government, has been able to deprive the smaller shipping companies of coal, until they sell a proportion of their fleets of colliers or fishing-smacks.All ships built in Holland for neutral nations are subjected to German supervision. If German material is used, owners, even of an important firm such as Hennevig Brothers, are compelled to invest their profits in German War Loans or Treasury Bonds. Any Dutch firm which repairs a Norwegian vessel is forced to deposit in Berlin 500 M. for each ton of carrying capacity. Should the Dutch protest, they are threatened at once with a restriction of raw material, or with a position on the &quot; black list,&quot; such as will render them powerless to trade, save at Germany&apos;s good pleasure, and at the present time, negotiations are in progress, which, if carried through, would bind the Dutch mercantile marine in German fetters.Their high-handed attitude has not, however, prevented the Germans from carrying out. several transactions with their smaller neighbour. They have already purchased a large number of steam-trawlers and herring-drifters in Holland. At present the vessels are under.Dutch direction, and fly the Dutch flag, but after the war Germany will obtain the full right of ownership. New companies have been formed with German capital, and in preparation for the Central European trade numerous Belgian lighters have lately been purchased by Dutch firms on behalf of one Hinkeling, of Ruhrort. The draught of the vessels has already been altered for work between the Herne and the Ems canals.Important requisitions have also been made in Belgium, where practically the whole of the barges are now applied to German traffic. Two American steamship companies which had their headquarters in Antwerp (the International Mercantile Marine
Companies, and the Navigation belgo-aniericaine) have been sequestered. Despite the protests of the Spanish consul, grain elevators, linen ropes, and steerage outfits have been taken over by the Germans and utilized, or stored for future use.Denmark has also been, subjected to peaceful penetration. An apparently legitimate transaction was the registration of a new company in Copenhagen, under the patronage of Hugo Stinnes, who provided the capital of 5,000,000 marks, but made his patronage conditional upon the opening of branch offices abroad; and the elaborate instructions for negotiation with foreign firms lend to the company that peculiar German tone with which all such transactions are coloured. . With an eye to activities after the war, the new company has also been instructed to store various products used in mining, agriculture, chemistry, and electricity, doubtless, with a view to replenishing German stocks. A. similar transaction was the purchase of the Dansk-Eussisk Dampskibsselskab (the Danish Russian Steamship Company), which was sold to Germany lock, stock, and barrel, flying the Danish flag for the duration of the&apos;war, and then reverting to the purchasers. In addition, the Handelsbanken of Copenhagen, a firm with undoubted enemy connections, has been negotiating for the purchase of Vicley, a fishing station in Iceland, and a plan for the cession of the Faroe Islands in return for a portion of Schleswig-Holstein has found some favour among the pro-German Danish Socialists. But the most significant attempt to use Denmark as an intermediary is the recent offer made by certain German shipbrokers to obtain control over an unlimited number of vessels. The conditions are as follows : the brokers undertake to hire out the ships on a time charter to some &quot; very special clients, absolutely first class,&quot; for at least four years after the war. &quot; Prompt delivery&quot; of the vessels may be taken to mean delivery within six months of the declaration of peace. The rate of hire is fixed at 22s. per ton per month, and the Germans have agreed to pay all expenses, including insurance and the expenses of the German crews.At the present time the German Government is making more severe restrictions in the conditions on which they supply shipbuilding materials to Denmark. They are now demanding that: (1) vessels constructed with German materials must lie up for the period ofthe war; that (2) the Danes shall give them the right for five years after the war to charter such vessels at current rates, with the option of purchase at any time within that period. So far the Danish shipbuilders have unanimously refused these onerous terms.Considering all these facts it is little wonder that the Northern neutrals, especially Norway, have shown some impatience at Germany&apos;s attitude, and the Norwegian ship-building yards have also rejected the conditions imposed by the German Steel Bureau. As a result the shipbuilding industry is threatened with a complete stoppage, for the necessary imports have practically ceased. In view ofthe precarious situation in which the Scandinavian nations find themselves owing to Germany&apos;s preponderance in the Baltic, there is a great activity and expansion in the auxiliary trades, such as the iron and steel industry. In Norway, the Nas Ironworks, the Christiania Steel Works, and the Hamar iron Foundry are laying down new plant; the Danish iron industries have decided to erect large steel works outside Copenhagen, and the Swedish Seddeholm Company is planning large ironworks in Lapland. This activity, says &quot; Engineering,&quot; is in part clue to their unpleasant experiences during the war; and the erection of the first iron and steel works and rolling-mill in Holland has attracted considerable attention in Germany, from which country Holland has hitherto received the greater portion of her requirements for shipbuilding and other industries.At the present time the Scandinavian Powers are preparing for a more intimate co-operation in commercial matters, which, if successful, will eventually be extended to shipping. It would be desirable to attract such an organisation towards an alliance with the corresponding British interests and away from German influence. This would apply especially to the mercantile marine. If the shipowners are induced to look to Germany for their raw material, insurance, and capital, and if the seameifs unions are affiliated to the corresponding organisations in Germany, the effect would be to us disastrous. The more closely all these interests can be linked to this country the better, and the bias of any inter-Scandinavian union should be encouraged in the direction of Anglo-Scandinavian co-operation, especially as to shipping.Among the Latin races of Europe and South America pressure and penetration have been fully exercised. In Spain the Compania Transatlantica, a company reported to be pro-German and immune from submarine attack, is engaged on the construction of 200,000 tons of shipping, destined, so it is affirmed, for trade between Hamburg and South America. The whole concern is assumed to be the product of German influence and capital, but this needs confirmation.   A German political agent, one Gutfeld, has[367-30] D
10been provided with funds to stimulate the building of freight steamers for traffic between Spain and Germany, or any ports which the Germans may desire. Another report furnished to the British Government, and taken from an intercepted letter, states that Spanish capital and labour are being utilised for the building of motor-boats at Cartagena, by a man of pro-German sympathies and connections.In Latin America the Germans have also exhibited considerable activity. Before the United States entered the lists the &quot; New Philadelphia &quot; line from Buenos Aires to the United States of America was largely in German hands: wool and hides were exchanged for American coal consigned to a German coaling company, while the smaller Allied firms were deprived of its use. The only oil-fuel ship plying between Chilian ports is a Chilian vessel, owned by Chilians and insured by an English company; but she is run by a Danish captain of German sympathies, who ousted an English engineer in order that his post might be given to a German from the interned battleship &quot; Gotha.&apos; In selling 150,000 tons of shipping to the Argentine Government, the Germans stipulated for a secret clause by which the vessels should be used on the conclusion of peace for the immediate carriage of foodstuffs to Germany. Wherever possible, materials of various kinds are stored for immediate release as soon as the war is over. In Paraguay the majority of the shares in a large cold-storage company, the &quot; Frigorifico San Salvador &quot; have been sold to a German syndicate. The Hamburg-America Line has acquired large interests in the Caribbean Shipping Company, which is intended to trade along the West Coast of America from Panama to Guayaquil. The same powerful line has planned a canal in Costa Rica to connect the lagoons from Morin to Rio Colorado in order to develop the banana trade at Puerto Limon, and to compete with the United Fruit Company: a scheme which has the supervision and benediction of the German vice-consul.(g.) The Improvement of the European Waterways.While the continental or Mittel-Europa school was in the ascendant, grandiose schemes were formed for the reconstruction and connection of the waterways in Central Europe. All these schemes bear the mark of imagination. As early as 1915 their advocates were contemplating the hegemony of the Balkan States under Austro-Germanic influence, and looked forward to the assured economic preponderance of the Central Powers. The Baltic was to be linked to the Black Sea by way of Danzig, Poland, and the Ukraine; Hamburg was to be connected with Central Asia by means of the Don and the Volga; the Rhine and the Danube canals were, to form a waterway large enough for German ships of war to travel from Kiel to Odessa, and it was conceived that the route for vessels from North and East might one day relieve German commerce from the indignity of utilising the Straits of Gibraltar and the Dardanelles. Fiume was to be connected with Central Europe by the Danube-Aclreia canal, and a route from Salonika to Budapest was also projected. &apos;It would be a mistake to treat these schemes as pure fancy, but time is required for their fulfilment. The oceanic party has shown that the development of Germanv&apos;s Mittel-Europa estate is dependent upon the profits of overseas commerce. Meanwhile the ground is prepared, and since the cost of transport by road or rail is prohibitive, the canalisation of Central Europe has been steadily undertaken. Some i&apos;,600 miles have been constructed, improved, or completed, and another 21,000 miles are planned or are under construction.A broad outline of the general scheme was issued in 1917 : (a.) A new canal and extensions to connect the Rhine near Wesel and the Ems,and so to widen the latter river that the Rhine.traffic can be diverted fromRotterdam to Emden. (b.) A Rhine-Danube Canal for vessels up to 1,200 tons, connected by an arm fromBamberg on the Main to Steppberg on the Danube, (c.) A Strasburg-Lake Constance-Danube canal for vessels up to 1,200 tons. (d.) A canal connecting the Danube with the Oder, and with extensions to theElbe, the Vistula, and the West Galician coal-fields, (e.) The canalisation of the Moselle, by which Germany can obtain her iron orefrom Alsace-Lorraine, Longwy, and Briey.In preparation for this comprehensp/e scheme, the German Empire has joined with Bavaria in providing a large proportion of the requisite capital. Towards the close of 1917 the Main-Danube Waterway Company was formed, with a capital of 5,000,000 marks.   The Empire and Bavaria were each responsible for 2,000.000 marks; an
311association of shareholders and the Grand Duchy of Baden provided the remainder. Numerous companies,, such as Krupp, the Deutsche Bank, the A.E.G., and Siemens-Schuckert have taken up interests in the project. Early in 1918 the Bavarian Govern-ment raised a loan of 1,880,000 marks for enlarging the harbour at Regensburg, the terminus of the Danube-Main canal, and a centre from which numerous projected branches will eventually radiate.Despite certain technical difficulties such as the varying levels and velocity of the Danube, and its ice-bound condition in winter, much has already been completed or designed. Between Aschaffenburg and Passau, locks have been constructed which can contain two vessels of 1,200 tons side by side. In Austria-Hungary prisoners of war have been set to blast away the rocks, convertible boats for continuous transport have been constructed, and on a section of the river, where the towing-chain had been destroyed by the Serbians, a light railway has been built, and small locomotives supply the necessary haulage. The utilisation of electricity for towing power is contemplated. In order to increase the yearly traffic from 3,000,000 to 7,000,000 tons a continuous service has been established, and at night the dangers of navigation are lessened by the aid of powerful searchlights. There is a scheme on foot for building a second channel through the Iron Gates, so that the up-stream traffic can proceed without hindrance. In view of the importance of manufactures, the rapids will be utilised for driving the machinery of the neighbouring mills, and the Danube is destined to become the greatest and cheapest source of power in Europe.The significance of these schemes was shown during von Ktihlmanns eulogy of the treaty with Rumania, &quot; The great waterway,&quot; said he, &quot; connecting the east and west, which has only come to be appreciated at it full value during this war, is the Danube.&quot; Of the 2,300 kilom. which are navigable, 1,300 are in Rumanian territory ; and in 1913 Rumania owned 11,500 of the 29,500 vessels plying upon the river. When the Danube is connected with the Oder and the Rhine, Rumania&apos;s economic importance will be increased, much to the advantage of her conquerors. Formerly the goods exported from Sulina passed through the Mediterranean to Rotterdam; when the new plans are carried out, her corn and petroleum will pass up the Danube, and the barges will return with the products of the Central Powers : she will be induced to buy her coal from Germany instead of from England, thus obviating the necessity of storage and transfer from barges to trucks. In order to ensure Rumanians interdependence upon the Central European circle, preparations have been made at Hamburg for the building of oil-tank steamers ; the Hamburg-America Line and Herr Hugo Stinnes are taking over the interests in the Oil Lease Company, and are on the point of combining with the Deutsch-Amerikanische Petroleum-Gesellschaft, which has recently paid a handsome dividend. On the strength of an agreement between the Central Powers, Germany has obtained the site for a new shipping yard above the Thurn Severinar ship-yards, within the district leased from Rumania. The &quot; petroleum peace&quot; is of the greatest importance to the Germans, who hope, indeed, that the use of oil as a motive power may make a part of their mercantile marine independent of our coaling-stations. Experiments carried out before the war, and the range of the larger submarines, have encouraged the Germans to think that the Diesel engines may enable vessels of considerable tonnage to travel from Hamburg to Yokohama and back.In order that the central system may be complete, Germany is planning to connect her canals with those in neutral, occupied, and enemy territory. Three schemes have been put forward :  -(a.) A canal from Dtisseldorf to Belgium.(6.) A canal to connect the Rhine with the Meuse from a point between Bonn and Wesserling.(c.) A canal direct from the Rhine to Antwerp.In addition the Germans are keeping a sharp eye upon the importance of linking up the Alsatian system with the French canals, especially since the Rhone has been linked up with Marseilles [W.T.I.D. /P. 2/154. Geneva: 18.4.18. &quot; Deutscher Aussenhaudel,&quot; 10.1.18]. They have also designs upon the Swiss waterways and water-power: some alarm has been felt in Switzerland lest the value of the Upper Rhine as a waterway may be diminished by hydro-electrical schemes, and there is abundant evidence of the attempts made by Germany to obtain a permanent hold upon Swiss interests. [See W.T.I./M/167. Geneva, 17.4.18; and information furnished by W.T.I.D. to P.J.D.; AS. 83461/20.6.13.]Finally, there is some anxiety in Holland over the project of a canal from the
I12Rhine to Emclen, which would divert the traffic from Rotterdam, and would mean economic disaster for the chief port of the Netherlands.Summary of Part II.A casual glance at the foregoing evidence should sufficiently demonstrate the determination of the Germans to repair, in a great measure, the ravages of war. Their Government intends that the control of German shipping shall enable the Central Powers to control the destination of goods; and sees in the earnings of the mercantile marine an &quot; invisible export&quot; affecting the rate of exchange in Germany&apos;s favour. In no sphere connected with shipping have the Central Powers been idle; they have constructed new yards, projected an elaborate shipbuilding programme, developed the European canal system, and imposed economic regulations upon various neutrals.Despite these preparations there is for Germany one thing needful to regain the fullest access to the raw material for industry. On that point the German economists and shipowners display distinct apprehension. They will endeavour to saddle the treaty of peace with various supplementary agreements for the restoration of their commerce. Potash and dyes will be set against cotton and jute. Among our enemies the power of an economic boycott is fully recognised, and they are conscious that the resumption of their overseas trade is dependent upon the framing of decisions which they are, at the present time, unable to affect.c
