0i19 rJuly 24, 1918.FOREIGN (OTIC8.GJBRMAHl/012MEMORANDUMonKtaiAM - HERILIHG - RIME.FurtherInformation.In oonneotion with the Ktlhlmann crisis and tho appointment of Eintze, some interesting disclosures are being made in the German press.It   With regard to Hertlingrs declaration on the subjectof Belgium, it is now revealed that it was at a Grown Councilof September 11, 1917, that the conviction was aoquired that(1)Belgium must be given up.       In spite of this conviction no clear public declaration of this decision took place. Fragmentary announcements were made from time to time just as in the case of the promise of Prussian Electoral Reform. It is believed that if a clear and decisive announcement with regard to Belgium had been made immediately after the Council, no little effect would have been produced;   but the opportunity was lost.It is suggested that &quot;other factors&quot; - by whioh evidently the Higher Command is meant - were responsible for the Governmentre hesitation and delay.    ! be Pan-German press has hinted that there was not complete unanimity in the Crown Council of last September.    This would explain why Hertling and also Ktlhlmann were always so careful not to commit themselves too deeply in their statements about Belgium.(1)   Frankfurter Zeitung, No.192, evening ed., July 13.
- It Is--snggeBted that the opinion of the Higher Command .has now changed and that Hintze wiXL -pursue a polioy whioh will not he essentially-ALEforent^from that of Kiihlmann. At any rate there is an evident desire on the part of the Government and some of its supporters in the Majority bloc, that this should be believed, both in Germany and abroad. It is assumed that the Higher Command approves of the two declarations which Hertling made on the subject of Belgium on June 11th and 12th.There is a general inclination among the Majority Parties - an inclination which is naturally strongest in the Catholic Centre - to regard Hertling&apos;s statement of the 12th on Belgium as a distinct advance upon his former declarations. Hertling himself asserts that he&quot; said practically the same things on Pebrjiary 24.    Yet it cannot be forgotten that the Prussian Conservative leader, Herr von Heydebrand, interpreted his words as meaning that Germany meant to retain a political, economic and military supremacy, while a member of the Reichstag Majority gathers^ that Belgium was to be quite in-dependent &quot;even of Germany&quot;.    It is thought that all ambi-guity has now keen dispelled, and, if Germany could negotiate with Belgium as a pawn, It is probable that she would offer or withdraw various degross of &quot;independence&quot; according to the equivalents which the Western Powers, particularly England, were willing to grant.    Por the rest, Mr. Balfour has disposed of this monstrous &quot;pawn&quot; proposal.Equally extraordinary is Hertling&apos;s cool assumption that Belgium should at once be prepared to li$e&quot;in good and friendly relations with Germany&quot; after the treatment whioh she has received.    Even the Bolsheviks strained at a similar demand in the Brest-Litovsk treaty, although ultimately they had to swallow it.     Very naif is the assumption in the
German liberal press that England, having only drawn the sword on behalf of Belgium, has now no further pretext for fighting.    It is suggested that England has other objects in view, advantages and acquisitions which she oovers with fine phrases such as &quot;the protection of small nationalities&quot;. But the really astounding thing is that German critics should permit themselves any allusions whatever to the subject of small nationalities after the German treatment, not merely of Belgium, but of the Russian border States.2.   $be Parliamentary situation,after Hertling1s speeches of July 11 and 12, is worth watching.    The Majority-Catholic Centre, Radicals and the Governmental Socialists - has voted the war credit and has thus implicitly given the Government a new lease of confidence-    The most influential organ of the Radicals, the frankfurter fleitung, thinks, after refleo-tion, that this was a mistake5 so far as the Left is concerned. It says:-The events of the Ktthlmann crisis had shown that neither the Left in the Majority and as represented in the Government (Payer), nor the composite Majority of the Reichstag as a whole, nor the Government, nor the Imperial Chancellor decide our policy, but that it is decided by &quot;other factors&quot;, as the Chancellor euphemistically put it.    We therefore continue to hold the opinion that it would have been logical not to take any further responsibility for the future policy of the Government.In another article the same journal appeals to theexample of Mr. Asouith - it is remarkable how often Englishprecedents are cited - as showing the kind of oppositionwhich the Left could conduct in Germany without changing itsessential attitude towards the conduot of the war.   Hertling,it is urged, has given no adequate explanation of the mostrecent events (Kilhlmann&apos;s resignation and its circumstances)and the &quot;frankfurter Zoitimg&quot;1 1 fears that the Left is&quot;TOfrankfurter Zeitung, lo.191, Evening Ed., July 12.
lobmistaken in thinking that the assurances whioh have been given, unsatisfactory as it admits them to be, are sufficient to prevent serious developments of policy in opposition to its view.    This attitude of the Left is allowed, hovrever, to be intelligible from a patriotic point of view.(1)3.   It is now stated by the Vossische Zeitun%     that Hintze was suggested as KUhlmarm^ successor by the Civil Cabinet of the Emperor.    This newspaper was lately described by the Socialist, Cohn, in the Reichstag as having become the organ of Ludendorff.     Its information may therefore be as good as Ludendorff can make it.     The question, however, arises why Ludendorff should desire it to be believed that the Civil Cahinat (which practically means the Private Secre-tary) of the Emperor was responsible for suggesting Hintze. Vho suggested Hintze to the Civil Cabinet?The Chief of the Civil Cabinet, up to the resignation of Micbaelis, was Herr von Valentin!.    He was made to retire in order to make way for a high official, von Berg, formerly President of Pomerania, who commanded the confidence of the Prussian Conservatives and the Higher Command.     It would be interesting if it could be shown that Ludendorff has some scruple about taking responsibility for influencing the appointment of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs and prefers to transfer it to the Civil Cabinet.In any case, as the Radical press points out, the appointment of Hintze at the instance either of the Civil Cabinet or of the Higher Command does not tend to support Hertling1s assurances that it is he (the Chancellor) who conducts the policy of the Empire.    He does not appear to have been consulted about the dismissal of  iQilmann, and he evidently did not select ISihlmann&apos;s successor.    The(1)   Yossische Zeitung, 10.549, Morning Ed. July 11,
Id J-*5-grankfurt er Zei tung^1 ^fortinently asks:   &quot;Is this the Head of the Government whose words should he taken as a pledge for safe and steady policy?&apos;&apos;&apos;4.   The Reichstag has adjourned till November 5th and theMain Committee till October.     It is very noteworthy that(2)Stein, writing to the ffrankfurter,, Zejtung;   &quot;from Berlin before the French counter-offensive, states that before October &quot;something decisive on the battle-field is expected&quot;.    He would hardly speak so emphatically in this sense after the . serious check to Ludendorff on the toarne.The Main Committee can be called together at any time at the instance of the party leaders, with the approval of the President of the Reichstag after consultation with the Chancellor.(?-) Frankfurter Z eiturg, No. 191, 3v ening Ed,, July 12, 1918.
