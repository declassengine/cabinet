C1WBBKLAIH said that he had called this meeting in accordance with the request of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 450 Minute 10) in order to examine and decide on the question of the liability to Military Service of Subjects or Citizens of Neutral States who were born in the United Kingdom, but who have made a declaration of alienage and are no longer British Subjects.     The question under discussion was fully dealt with in the Memorandum by the Foreign Office which had been circulated (G.T.5075)LORD ROBERT CECIL said that the only men whose cases were at present in question were those Swiss, over the age of 21, who had failed to make declarations of alienage in renunciation of their British Status within the time limit stipulated by the British Government.,   He suggested that the Foreign Office should be allowed to settle this question by the retention of such men for service in the United Kingdom only and urged, in support of this proposal that he believed that such a decision would be acceptable to the Swiss Government, and that the number concerned was so small that the question of fean-power need not be taken into consideration, but that the fact that these men were called upon to serve would allay discontent in the districts in which they lived.Both SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES and BRIGADIER  OCTAL CHILES expressed their agreement with the proposal of Lord Rcbert Cecil.KR. CHAMBERLAIN said that as all the Departments concerned were agreed, it was only necessary for him to record his formal concurrence on behalf of the war Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens. S.V/.
