3 Document is the property of Hi3 Britannio Majesty^ Government)80CABINET.ALLIED POST-WAR REQUIREMEITOS. Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.Representations have from time to time been made to the Ministry of Reconstruction with regard to the desirability of securing for manufacturers in this country a proportion of the contracts rrhich rill ultimately have to be placed in connection with various rork for the reconstruction of Belgium and Northern Prance, and for meeting the post-war requirements of other al-lied countries.    It has been represented to me by manufacturers ami others that it tfould be practicable, before the termination of the war, to collect and arrange statistics as to those primary and more immediate needs of the various allied countries which could be satisfied from the United Kingdom, and, within certain limits, to make arrangements for, the placing of contracts on some provisional basis.    Manufacturers in this country are already considering the readjustments in their businesses (including the provision or adaptation of machinery and plant) which will be necessary in order to effect the transition from war work to civil industry:    and an Important factor in their consideration must obviously be the possibility of obtaining contracts with allied foreign Governments or firms,I understand that, so far as Belgium is concerned, the work of collecting and examining statistics of requirements has been undertaken by the Inter-Ally Committee for the Reconstruction of Belgium, but that progress has been somewhat slow.    A serious difficulty ho doubt, in connection with the work to be done by this Committee, is that Belgium to in German occupation, and that, owing to ignorance of existing conditions there it is particular-ly difficult to forecast future needsj.
81(2)The Committee   consists, I understand, or oir;ht representa-tives of Belgium, and one representative each from Britain, Pranc c, 11aly, and the V.S,A., Br ita in, b eing repro sented by the Chairman of the Caraaission International do Ravitaillement, It receives from the Belgian Government tabulated listc of poat-uar requirements drarsi up by that C-overnment on advice tendered to it by the Contpoir national, a Body of Belgian manufacturers sitting in London.    I believe that the Committee has already received a list of Belgian post-Far requirements in respect of railways and agricultural machinery, but that nothing has been deceived of a sufficiently precise and detailed character to enable the question of placing con-tracts to be considered.     I am told, however, that a sub-committee has nor: been formed with a vicr to expediting the preparation of the lists required.-  For other countries than Belgium there is, so far as I am aware, no body in existence charged with ascertaining probable requirements, end it is, I think a matter for immediate consideration whether Committees upon lines similar to the Belgian Committee might not usefully be constituted for the purpose of dealing *;lth the probable needs of other countries, in particular Prance and Italy,    The Belgian Committee is international, and. It is clearly desirable that any similar Committees should also be international, since it is most necessary that tre should avoid any suspicion of trying to obtain an unfair advantage over our Allies in securing contracts.   The composition of them &quot;vould require careful consideration in the light of the experience gained by the Belgian Committee, e,g. re might have to ro-consider, in the light of this experience, the numerical proportion in v.7hich the country rrhose needs are
82(3)to be supplied should be represented upon the Committees, and again, T;:e mi/jht have to consider whether it is desirable that manufacturing interests in &quot;this country should be directly represented on the Caiiw.ittees.    The material collected by the Committees would presumably be passed ultimately to the Department of Overseas Trade, or- to any organisation attached to that Department ffhich may hereafter be created, whoso function it would be to correlate the continental requirements with one another and with the overseas demand.As to the detail of the arrangements between the existing Belgian. Committee and the Department of Overseas Trade, 1 have no precise information,, and I am n&amp;t clear at what point the work of the one body will pass to the other.     It appears to me, however, that when both bodies have completed and checked their survey, it will still be necessary, so far as contracts to be placed in this country are concerned, that there should be called into being an organisation competent to deal with the actual allocation of such-contracts between the various British firms.    TTo cannot allow manufacturers to take the first contract that comes their way . without regard both to domestic requirements as a whole and to other foreign requirements...   Unless some such organisation be created it will inevitably happen, that prices will be forced up, and that work will in many cases bo  iven to firms not the best equipped for executing it.    Mr. sm opinion is that the work of allocating contracts should be entrusted as far as possible to some or^anisa-tion of the manufacturers themselves.I would wish therefore to surest for consideration the question firstly, of creating an international machinery for ascertaining the requirements of our continental Allies other than Belgium (or at any rate the requirements of Prance), and secondly,
83(4)of setting up an organisation comprised mainly of British Manufacturers vrhoso business it ::oulc1 be to convert the statistics of these requirements into such a form as to enabke contracts to be fairly allocated among the different British interests.It rill of course be open to the Belgian end French Government or to Belgian and French firms, to place their contracts as between us and other allied nations trhcre they pleace, but tho choice iyill be to a great extent determined by the credits Milch they arc able to secure.    It is important therefore that there should oxist not only a Committee to investigate the minimum requirements of those Allies likely to make demands upon our credit, but also an organisation of British manufacturers 7hom the Government can consult.    The Government &quot;ill require to kaor from these manufacturers what risks they are prepared to take upon their era account, and they&apos; Trill vfish to fciou from the C-overnmont to vrhat extent it is prepared to guarantee payment on certain foreign orders,C. 4BDIS02T.23rd iuly 1918,
