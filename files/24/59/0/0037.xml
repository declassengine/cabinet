Colonel I. My Jones,r   p A gjrig Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]&quot;       &quot;^2Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1918.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 61. Week ended 20th July, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Minelaying operations have been carried out in the North Sea and in the Heligoland North Sea. Bight.On 19th July seven R.A.F. machines, which were flown from vessels of the Grand Fleet operating off the Jutland coast, carried out a bombing attack on the Zeppelin sheds at Tondern, Schleswig. Direct hits were made on a large double shed, which was completely destroyed. A second shed was hit, resulting in a heavy explosion, but owing to fierce anti-aircraft fixe, and smoke from the first shed, it was not possible to observe whether the second shed was completely destroyed. Four of our machines failed to return, but three of these landed in Denmark, and have been interned.On 19th July the destroyer &quot; Garry,&quot; while escorting a convoy from Tyne to Humber, rammed and sank the German submarine U.B. 110. In doing so &quot; Garry&quot; was badly damaged, mostly above the water line, and was towed stern first to the Humber.The weather has been unfavourable for flying, but some patrols and reconnaissances have been carried out in various areas by R.A.F. machines employed on naval duty.On 18th July two of our seaplanes in company with two aeroplanes, while on patrol about 4 miles south-east of Kentish Knock Light Vessel, were attacked by seven enemy seaplanes which were painted a light green about the colour of the sea, and as they attacked from the direction of the sun, Were not seen until they were close to our machines. Our two aeroplanes fought with the utmost gallantry, one of them fighting an enemy machine until he had driven it down into the sea out of control, and the other continuing the engagement even after both guns had jammed, and repeatedly charging through the enemy machines which were attacking, although two were on his tail practically the whole time.Meanwhile one of our seaplanes which had landed on the water safely continued to fight one of the enemy which had followed her to the water, until both eventually burst into flames. The five remaining hostile machines were finally driven off by our two aeroplanes. Our second seaplane broke off the fight and steered for Westgate, and was soon overtaken by our aeroplanes, which, however, in view of their damaged condition, could not remain with her, but returned direct to Manston. Nothing has since been heard of this seaplane although a thorough search has been made, and it is assumed that she was forced to come down and broke up in the rough sea prevailing at the time.In addition, machines from Dunkirk have made the following raids :  FlandersApproximate Area,weight ofDate.

In the course of aerial fighting during the above raids four enemy machines were) destroyed and nine driven down out of control, and four of our machines are missing.On several occasions enemy destroyers have been attacked of! the Flanders Coastl with bombs and machine-gun fire, a direct hit with a bomb having been obtained on onej destroyer ; also a bomb dropped on an armed trawler caused a fire.Casualties. On 15th July the transport &quot; Barunga,&quot; outward bound to Australia in convoy witl H.M.S. &quot; Kent,&quot; was torpedoed and sunk about 114 miles south-west of Bishop&apos;s Rocks] She was conveying unfit Australian troops, but there were no casualties.On 16th July the sloop &quot; Anchusa &quot; was torpedoed and sunk 30 miles north of Malii Head, 79 officers and men being lost.On 18th July the destroyer &quot; Pellew&quot; was torpedoed when 43 miles from Kinnaird Head whilst escorting a Scandinavian convoy, but was towed safely to port.  There weitH no casualties.On 18th July H.M. trawler &quot;Lancer&quot; was sunk in collision with H.M. yacht) &quot; Vagrant&quot; off Brighton Light Vessel, but the crew was saved.Coastal motor boat No. 50 is missing.  It is probable that she had engine trouble while in the Heligoland Bight on the night of 18th July.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines The number of enemy submarines of a type which operates further afield than thi operating. North Sea, which were located during the week under review, was from 16 to 22. Included amongst these were two of the converted &quot;cruiser&quot; type, both of which were working oil the North American Coast, where one of them has been laying mines. There has been concentration of enemy submarines off the North Coast of Ireland, where as many s\ seven were operating at one time, and considerable activity has also been experienced ii the western approaches to the English Channel. Activity on the part of the smallei boats has been consistently maintained off the North-East Coast of England.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemjwith enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during recent weels submarines. an(j fae nature of the craft which have been engaged ; and also the number of submarinel which have been destroyed as the result of such actions: 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		June 29th.

Its,Although the number of vessels lost during the week under review does not exceed the average of recent weeks, the total British tonnage lost is considerably greater than usual, owing to the inclusion of two large vessels the &quot; Justicia &quot; of over 32,000 tons and the &quot; Carpathia&quot; of over 13,000 tons.The Table in Appendix I shows the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of losses by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of all merchant steamships, both British and Foreign, of over 500 tons gross register, and the Table in Appendix II is a summary of those percentages for recent weeks.The tonnage which arrived at or left United Kingdom ports during the week under review exceeds 5,000,000 tons for the first time in any one week since these Tables were compiled. The percentage of losses to sailings of vessels engaged in Overseas trades is this week 3-12 as against 1 -39 the previous week, the increase being mainly due to the inclusion of the losses of the two large vessels before referred to. In Cross-Channel and Coasting trades the percentages are -26 and -11 respectively as against no losses in the previous week, while for all United Kingdom trades the percentage is 1 -25 as against -54 in the previous week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, I Foreign as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine, classified&apos; according to areas.It will be seen from this Table that the enemy have resumed active operations in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel, but in the Mediterranean there is a considerable reduction of activity to record. Each of the nine attacks made by the enemy in the Atlantic and Bay of Bisca)&apos;&apos; areas during the week resulted in the sinking of the vessel attacked.The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised convoy which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such convoys, compared with corresponding figures for previous periods, are as follows : Losses of British and Foreign Steamships in Trades.LOBSyer srs.Areas jn which vessels lost.Vessels convoved.

4Enemy attacks in June classified.The losses in the Mediterranean were three in the Bizerta-Alexandria Convoy, one in the Genoa-Gibraltar Convoy, and one in the Marseilles-Malta Convoy. The figures in respect of the Coastal Convoy (North of Humber) are this week for the first time available, and will in future be included regularly in the Table.The total number of enemy attacks made upon steamships of all nationalities of over 500 tons gross during the month of June was 123 as against 155 in May, 160 in April, and 213 in March. The following Table shows the method and result of the attacks in June, and the areas in which they took place : Method of attack.	East Coast.	English Channel.	West Coast.	Mediter-ranean.

If a still lona view is taken, and the figures for the last three half-years are considered, the decline enemy success is even more marked.ENEMY MINES.Minelaying.      During the week under review the enemy has added considerably to his mine baril^&apos; of! the East Coast of Scotland, no less than 68 mines having been swept up in that arf The extensions which have been made to this minefield lie across the route of entry aj exit of H.M. ships to the Firth of Forth, but a broad channel has been cleared for F.
149purposes, and the situation is well in hand, the enemy&apos;s policy having developed on the lines anticipated.The following Table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels Casualties sunk by mine in Home Waters (including the Havre and Cherbourg areas) in recent weeks: Week Ended.

No enemy ships have entered or left men. Rotterdam.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.H.M. Consul at Archangel reports that the arrival of a Bolshevik Commissar with full powers to stamp out Allied agents and counter-revolution is shortly expected. A force of 1,000 Lettish rifles and 500 sailors is officially reported to be on the way to Archangel from Petrograd.General Poole has removed and banished the crew of the Russian cruiser &quot; Askold,&quot; which is at Murmansk and which it is now proposed to utilise in the cause of the Allies. General Maynard has recently made a reconnaissance towards Soroka, and found it necessary to disarm the Bolshevik railway guards and certain hostile inhabitants ; the result has been a marked improvement in the.attitude of the inhabitants of the district towards the Allies. It is proposed to hold Kandalaksha in force for the present, with an advanced Allied detachment at Kem, and a local force under Allied supervision is being organised to hold Soroka.Steps are being taken to send British naval officers to the Caspian to attempt to seize and arm the steamers, &amp;c, on that sea, and so prevent the eastward progress of the enemy.Spain.The German Government have agreed to refer the case of the Norwegian s.s. &quot; Tiger&quot; to the arbitration of the King of Denmark. This vessel was sunk in Spanish Territorial Waters by a German submarine, and is one of the few which the Spanish Government admit to have been sunk in their waters.Three further cases have recently occurred of Spanish merchant ships being sunk by German submarines, and in one of these vessels the Spanish Minister in Athens was taking passage to Spain, the German Government having been notified in advance of his impending departure.Admiral Pidal, the Spanish Minister of Marine, has resigned as a result of a difference with the Prime Minister in regard to the method of carrying out the recent naval reforms. He &quot;will probably be succeeded by Admiral Miranda, at present commanding the Instructional Squadron.Naval Staff.25th July, 1918.[Appendices.
