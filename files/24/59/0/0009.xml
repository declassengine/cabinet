MMQBliro FOR THE WAR CABINET.?e must all share the desire expressed by Mr.Barnes in his powerful Memorandum that a solution should be found for the Irish problem, but I venture to ask that the following consideration?, may be carefully weighed before the Government again commit themselves to any experiments in the direction of Home Rule.&apos;i?ere circulated by Mr.Halfour a few days ago,   I take leave to question whether the opinions therein expressed accurately represent the feeling in the United States of America.great many letters from America describing the state of feeling there towards the Irish Nationalists and their demand for Home Rule.   I have also had two very long conversations with a distinguished representative of the American Press from Chicago who is nou the--guest of His Majesty&apos;b Government in this country,   All the information I have consequently obtained convinces me that so long as the Irish refuse to take their full share in the far there will be no sympathy for them in the United States of -America.MroBarclay&apos;s despatch of the 27th June to which I have referred, talks of a meeting of an Irish Club in Chicago which was addressed by f Mr. TvP.,0&apos;Connor and also of a Convention which at the time of writing it was intended to summon in the Mississippi Valley,   I have had an opportunityI read the two communications from Washington whichI have had an opportunity recently to receive aThe writer of the two memoranda enclosed into
to-hear-the truth about both these&apos; meetings at first hand.At the dinner in Chicago ?fr, T.P. 01Connor was taken violentlyto task by a leading Irish American, a young man very represen-tative of those who were the strongest advocates of Home Ruleand the bitterest enemies of England before the question wasaffected by the attitude of the Irish towards the war.    Myinformant tells me that this Irish American attacked Mr,0&apos;Connor in unmeasured terms, resented his suggestion that theGovernment of the United States of America should interfere,and made it quite clear that the people of the United States wouldof America/give no hearing to Irish grievances so long as Irish remain out of the war.My informant also tells me that Mr. 0&apos;Connor at a private meeting after the Dinner was still more severely treated by several representative *Irish Americans and that his mission to Chicago was a complete failure.    As regards the Convention in the Mississippi Valley, my informant tells me that it was im-possible to hold it owing to the hostility towards the Nationalists, and that it was abandoned and he added &quot;We stopped it and we are not going to allow anything of the kind so long as this war goes on&quot;0    But it is no doubt true, and he expressed this view in strong terms, that if we could find a solution of the Irish problem we should make the position of the President infinitely easier and remove a great stumbling block from the path of the United States of America in their desire to come into closer relationship with the British Empire.Now is it possible to find a solution?    If we are to succeed we must, I venture to say, fearlessly face facts and I would observe first of all that there is no hope of finding a Home Rule measure which would satisfy the Irish Nationalists. They have abandoned themselves to Sinn Fein.   The demand made now is for Dominion Home Rule and nothing short of this will content them.    I am convinced that to-day the great mass of people in this country would never consent to any form of HomeRule
Rule which would give Ireland the power, should she choose to exercise it, of interfering with Great Britain in her defence against an enemy,Mr. Barnes is I think in error when he says that the feeling in Ulster has been embittered by the move towards Conscription.     This really is not the case;   Ulster has un-doubtedly hardened in her opposition to Home Rule, but this is due not to the threat of Conscription but to the announce-ment that Conscription would be accompanied by Home Rule.Mr a Barnes suggests two alternatives -(a) The Bill prepared by the Committee over which I presided:(b) A Bill on the lines of what is known as &quot;the clean cut&quot;. To introduce either of these at the present momentwould I believe be to court hopeless failure, (a) would receive the support of none of the Nationalists: would be bitterly opposed by Ulster and I think a considerable majority of the Unionists of the other three provinces, -(b) would be rejected with scorn by the Nationalists of Ireland generally and would I believe be resented by the Unionists of the three Southern provinces who feel that to introduce a Home Rule Bill by which they are deprived of the support of the Unionists of Ulster is to betray them in a wholly unjustifiable manner.Mr. Barnes is afraid that the movement towards Federalism ha,s not progressed.    Here again I doubt if Heiis quite correct,    I have been at pains to make very care-ful enquiries continuously for some weeks, and I believe that the cause of Federalism has progressed and that all that is wanted to-day is.an opportunity in Parliament to debate the question and a clear definite lead from the Government.It is quite true that a Federal plan would not receive the support of Irish Nationalists, at all events openly, but ? there are many of them who in their hearts would welcome it,the ir
their opposition would be of an extremely lukewarm character and even if they poured contempt upon the proposals the posi-tion of the Government in introducing a measure applicable to the whole of the United Kingdom would be far stronger both in Parliament and in the country than it would be if the measure dealt only with Ireland and was repudiated by all classes in Ireland.As regards our Dominions and the United States of America, I believe that the introduction of a measure of this kind would be heartily welcomed on its merits and it would convince them that we are in earnest in our desire to settle the Irish difficulty and would receive their support. For these reasons I greatly regret that it has not been pos-sible to have the two days debate before Parliament adjourns in order to discuss Federalism,,    We are going-to waste a day upon alleged Irish grievances, which will do nothing to helpmattersj while we say we are unable to find time to discusswhichthis greater question/would I believe provide a solution of the problem which has so long troubled the countryaI would remind my colleagues that on the 1st October the period of grace in Ireland expires,    There seems to be no prospect at present of obtaining the 50,000 recruits. Pressure for men for the Army is great now, will it not be far greater in October?    If I am rightr surely the Govern-ment will be compelled to face the question of -conscripting the young men of Ireland and if they are not ready with a definite scheme for self-Government their position may easily become acute0    For this additional reason I regret that it is not possible to come to a decision as to the Federal plan0W.K.L. 24.7.18.COLONIAL OFFICE,
