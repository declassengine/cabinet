Waldorf Astor, M.P., has been appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food.Major Astor has appointed Mr. A. P. Hughes-Gibb, O.B.E., to be his private secretary.Mr. Hoover arrived in London on Friday, July 19, He was met at Waterloo by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food.Inter-Allied Supplies.The first meeting of the Allied Food Controllers was held at Lancaster House on Tuesday, July 23.   There were present: For the United Kingdom: The Food Controller, the Parliamentary Secretary, the Secretary and Second Secretary of the Ministry of Food, the Chairman andVice-Ohairman of the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies, the Chairman of the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply, and the Chairman of the Meat and Fats Executive.For France : M. Victor Boret (Minister of Agriculture and Food), M. Ernest Vilgrain (Under Secretary of State for Food), M. Rabel, Major L. R. Fillioux, and M. Destom.be.For Italy: Ii. E. Signor Crespi (Minister of Food), Professor Attolico, and Comm. Giulfrida.For the United States : Mr. Hoover, Mr. Sheldon, Mr. James Fox Bell, Drs. Taylor and Durand, Messrs. George F. Jackson, H. A. Smith, J. L. Simpson, L. L. Strauss, J. P. Cotton, and S. A. Mitchell.It was agreed, on Mf. Hoover&apos;s proposal, that Mr. Clynes should preside over the Conference.In welcoming the representatives of the Allies, Mr. Clynes expressed his conviction that just as there is common cause in the field of battle and as the soldiers of the Allied Nations are equally facing their risks and discharging their duties, those, dealing with food problems should think in terms not of any one country, but of all.Mr. Hoover outlined the food situation and prospects in the United States from the point of view of contribution to the Allied cause. He observed that he had from the President one general instruction, viz., that the people of the United States were eating at a common table, and that their aspect in all food matters was that of a common guest in a common cause. He submitted proposals for an Allied Food Council to consist of the four Food Controllers of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and the United States, with a Committee of representatives of the Food Controllers and delegates from the Allied Maritime Transport Council, the International Finance Council, and the International Scientific Committee.The French and Italian Food Controllers thanked Mr. Clynes for his welcome, and expressed their readiness favourably to consider Mr. Hoovers proposals.The second meeting of the Allied Food Controllers was held at the Ministry of Food on Wednesday, July 24. ,The main topic of discussion wras the better co-ordination of the food programme of the Allied countries.The Conference recorded its opinion that in framing a general food programme of food imports high priority should be given to the import of fodder and concentrated feeding stuffs for dairy purposes. It was decided that the Wheat Executive should be asked to make separate programmes for cereals for human and for animal con-sumption.It was agreed that the Wheat Executive should prepare its programme on the basis of a uniform milling percentage in all Allied countries.a   (33)6075-4   Pkl   135  7/18  B Ac S
2Future Supplies-Mr. G. S. Jackson, Vice-Prcsident of the United States Grain Corporation, and Mr. J. F. Bell, head of the Milling Division of the United States Food Administration, have held several conferences with the Wheat Commission. Mr. J. P. Cotton, head of the Meat Division of the United States Food Administration also attended a meeting of the Meat and Fats Executive, and discussed future meat supplies.Secondary Foods. The Programme Committee are dealing comprehensively with the whole question of the purchasing of secondary foodstuffs, and have, in effect, already sanctioned the purchase of certain quantities of honey, dried fruits, and eggs.The Allied Food Controllers were entertained at luncheon by the Lord Mayor of London on Tuesday, July 23.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.(1) The Fish (Distribution) Order, 1918, dated 16th July 1918, empowers the Food Controller to issue directions relating to the allocation and distribution of fish in Great Britain, and to fix the proportion of the available supplies to be consigned to any district or person. He may also order that fish shall not be sold until it shall have been landed.(2) The Pilchards Order, 1918, dated July 16, 1918, gives priority of purchase of pilchards to persons buying for home markets, and orders that where a person makes a declaration in writing that he is desirous of buying from a producer of fish or wholesale dealer in fish any pilchards, for the purpose of supplying home markets with fresh, kippered, or canned pilchards, such person shall, on payment of the maximum price, be entitled to have delivery of such pilchards, notwithstanding an agreement to sell in favour of any other person. Returns are to be furnished monthly from all persons curing or pickling pilchards.(3) The Rationing Order, dated 17th July 1918, brings under one scheme the various rationed foods which have hitherto been rationed under different schemes. The Public Meals Order, so far as concerns Great Britain, is absorbed in&apos; the new Order, subject to certain changes in regard to catering establishments, and other Rationing Orders are revoked and superseded.(4) The Poultry and Game (Prices) Order, 1918, dated ,18th July 1918, fixes, on and after 1st August, maximum wholesale and retail prices for poultry, grouse and black game. Birds sold bona fide for breeding, laying, or rearing purposes are exempted.(5) The Slaughter-houses (Licensing) Order, 1918, dated 19th July 1918, provides for the transfer of the licensing of slaughter-houses from the Local Food Control Committees to the Live Stock Commissioners appointed by the Food Controller. Hitherto the licensing has been done by the Food Control Committees, while the returns were made to the Live Stock Commissioner.(6) A direction under The Cheese (Distribution) Order, 1918, fixes a maximum retail price of Is. Sd. per lb. in respect of Government cheese distributed to the trade on and after 23 July.Control of Supplies and Prices.Bacon, Earns and Lard. The Ham and Beef and Cooked Meats Trade Association have proved that the retail prices fixed for cooked ham are too low. It has therefore been decided to postpone the operation of these prices. The suggestion that the maximum price of Wiltshire cured bacon is insufficient has. not been accepted.The imports of bacon continue to be heavy, and the stocks now amount to nearly 80,000 tons. In view of Mr. Cotton&apos;s assurance that the United States could guarantee the supplies required, it is proposed to remove the coupon restrictions on the sale of bacon and ham. There appears to be no prospect of a lower price for American bacon.Arrangements for the distribution of lard on the basis of a ration are in course of completion, but will not have full effect before the middle of September. In the meantime the trade is receiving from the Ministry 2,000 tons of lard a week, which is sufficient for the ration for domestic consumption.
1583Dried Fruits-Sanction lias been obtained from the American Board for credits amounting to 3  million dollars, divided equally between October and November, for the purchase of dried-fruits in America, it is estimated that these credits will enable us to purchase 7,000 tons of sultanas, 2,700 tons of rasins and 3,000 tons of plums, and instructions have been sent to America to buy in these proportions to the extent, to which the credits permit. Shipments will be made in November, but owing to difficulties of transport in America and this country, it is doubtful whether the dried fruits will arrive in time for Christmas.Various small quantities of raisins have reached this country from Spain and South Africa during the week.Linseed. The situation in respect of linseed is increasingly serious. The indent for the season 1917-18, was 314,500 tons, all of which was to be obtained from the Argentine. Up to date, some 89,000 tons only have been purchased in the Argentine. Fortunately during the last four months the Shipping Controller has been able to allocate freight space for linseed from India, with the result that some 48,000 tons have been purchased up to date. It is not anticipated that the imports for the whole season will exceed 260,000 tons, of which it is hoped to bring about 150,000 tons from the Argentine, and the balance from India, In the meantime consumption has remained at a level of about 7,000 tons a month, while imports have fallen to an average of about 3,700 tons a month. The result is that stocks in the country have fallen from 51,000 tons in September 1917 to 25,000 in May this year.The demands upon linseed oil both for glycerine production and for use in technical trades are very large, and this continual decrease in stocks is causing the very gravest anxiety.Meat. The country is becoming less dependent upon imported supplies of meat; in many areas last week home-produced meat furnished over 90 per cent, of the supplies required, and, except in the metropolitan area, the demand for imported meat nowhere exceeded 50 per cent, of the total.Milk. The Food Controller has announced that he is prepared to grant licences for the purchase or sale of milk of higher hygienic quality than the ordinary supply at higher prices than the maxima at present in force. The Local Government Boards for England and Scotland have decided upon two grades of milk, viz.: Grade A. Milk produced under exceptionally hygienic conditions from a herd free from tuberculosis, and immediately bottled in sterilised bottles on the premises where it is produced. For such milk id. per imperial quart bottle, and 3d. per imperial pint bottle may be charged in excess of the maximum, whether the milk is sold wholesale or retail by the producer or any other person, the extra charge to include the charge for bottling.Grade B. Milk produced under specially clean conditions from a herd free from tuberculosis. For such milk the prices in excess of the maxima shall not exceed : (a) When sold retail, 4d. per imperial gallon ;(6) When sold wholesale by or on behalf of the producer, M. per imperial gallon;   .(c) When sold wholesale by or on behalf of any other person than the producer, %\d. per imperial gallon.Channel Islands.Inquiries have been made into the methods of food administration in the Channel Islands. In Guernsey the example of Great Britain is closely followed, and the same foods are rationed. The new Rationing Books are being adopted. Jersey on the other hand relies on a system of voluntary rationing, except in the case of sugar. In neither island has it been found possible to subsidise the loaf.Pulping Stations.Before the amount of the fruit crop was known 22 premises had been taken for pulping stations. Two (at Cambridge and Marden) have been vacated, six others are being used ae stores, plant construction being delayed until next season&apos;s requirements are ascertained. Fourteen old and new stations will be ready very shortly to deal with any available crop. The staffs at all stations and stores have been reduced to the lowest point, and rigid economy is being exercised in all directions.
4Rations for1 Invalids.--Ithas been decided to grant further powers to Food Control Committees, with a view to facilitating the issue of extra rations to invalids in suitable cases. &quot; These include powers to deal with an extended list of diseases, for which extra rations of meat, butter, and margarine may be required, and to make grants of white flour or sugar for a limited time in certain specified cases.Enforcement of Orders.There is an increase of 81 in the number of prosecutions over the previous week. The total for the week is 858, of which 783 resulted in convictions. The 458 cases in Great Britain showed 89 per cent, convictions, and an average fine of U. lbs. id. The Irish cases showed 93 per cent, convictions, and an average fine of 7s. 6cZ.The Divisions sending in the greatest number of cases were : Division,	Oases,	Convictions.

The increase was chiefly due to heavier arrivals of cereals. In wheat the improvement was less marked than in oats, maize, and barley, imports of which were above the average of the year and amounted in all to 43,400 tons as compared with 13,600 tons during the week before. The total for all cereals, including rice, was 103,400 tons against 258,100 tons in the corresponding week of 1917. For the fifth week in succession importations of wheat were insufficient to meet current consumption.After two low weeks, receipts of meat were much higher, totalling 14,900 tons; a year ago imports were at practically the same figure. In the case of bacon and hams, imports for the previous week had been unusually high, and the reduced quantity received this week still remains above the average.The increase in cheese to 7,800 tons, the largest amount arriving in any week during the past eight months, is welcome, and substantially reduces the heavy deficit as compared with last year that has been progressive since the commencement of January. Imports of lard were also better than in the previous week, but only 203 tons of butter was received.Sugar, though lower, was slightly above the average; arrivals to date this year have again dropped below the total for the corresponding period of 1917.Consumption.^ Meat. The total quantity of meat, home and foreign, at the four markets included in Table B for the week ended July 13th was slightly higher than in the previous week.  A further increase in supplies of home-killed meat was again accompanied by
5a reduction in the quantity of foreign meat. The percentage of foreign meat in the total was 63, as compared with 82, the average for June, and with 45, the figure for the week ending July 14th, 1917.For the week ended July 20th supplies of home-fed beef and mutton at the Central London Markets showed a decline of 3 per cent, on the week before. The fall in imported supplies noted last week was stayed and was replaced by an increase of 8 per cent.Average weekly supplies of fat cattle during June (Table C) were 18 per csnt. less than during May. Since the middle of June, however, supplies have steadily increased. Fat sheep supplies rose throughout the month, the index for which was the highest since January.Bread and Flour. Pending the tabulation of the bakers&apos; returns for July 20th some indication of the trend of consumption may be obtained from the records of millers&apos; deliveries: 	Deliveries from	Add one-ninth for	Add Foreign Flour	Total.

To show actual consumption the figures would have to be adjusted for changes in bakers&apos;, retailers, and biscuit makers&apos; stocks, but unless replenishment of these stocks has been recently proceeding on a large scale, the marked fall in consumption so noticeable a year ago, has not been repeated this year.Fish. The total quantity of fish received at inland markets, other than Billings-gate, during the week ended July 13th was 23 per cent, less than in the previous week. Arrivals at Billingsgate for the week ended July 13th again showed an increase; 2,610 tons were received against 2,058 in the preceding week and 3,537 tons in the corresponding week of last year.Stocks.Changes in stocks of meat and provisions during the first fortnight of July were slight and of small moment. Cheese rose from 11,600 tons to 14,900 tons, and fish fell 2,800 tons to 26,100 tons. Estimated movements in cereal stocks since July 1st are shown below. All are lower, but the decrease in the case of cereals other&apos; than wheat is seasonal. For the first time in the present cereal year stocks of wheat have fallen below the figure for a year before, the estimated stocks on July 23rd, 1917, being 1,700,000 tons :-Commodity.
