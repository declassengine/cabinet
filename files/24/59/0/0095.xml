I forward an examination of the situation in Palestine and Mesopotamia written chiefly from the enemy point of view but the paper is agreed to by the Allied Branch.

The conclusion is that :-

(1) No great offensive by the Allies is advisable in Palestine.

(2) That the forces in Mesopotamia should be primarily used for assisting in the constitution of a menace to Germany in the East by securing the Southern shores of the Caspian and in the Caucasus in conjunction with whatever can be done along the Trans-Siberian Railway by Japanese and Czech troops, and from the Arctic Ports.(Signed).

i IkIn this paper tho military situation in Turkey and &quot;The Hear East&quot; 1b carefully examined with a view to deciding what, under the circumstances, is the beat course for the Central Powers, i.e., for Germany, to take in the Autumn and V/inter of 1916/1919,It is, of course, assumed that Germany will have very few troops to spare for any enterprise in this direction. But it ie not in dispute that it is her vital interest to keep Turkey in the war.    The same importance itt no longer attached to the Bagdad - Persia routfc to the ISaet since the collapse of Russia gave to Germany the complete oontrol of the Black Sea. But this has merely shifted the centre of gravity farther North, and Turkey is still an essential partner in the game of German extension to the East.The first steps in German Eastern policy are accomplished, 1.6., she has Becured control of the Mouth of the Danube, of the Port of Constanza, and of the Black Sea.The next step in the course of realisation, is the occupation of the Ports of Bat urn and Poti and control of the Caucasus including the railway to Baku, the oil-fiolcls and the Port of Baku itself.After that, the opening up of coKtmunication across the Caspian Sea with the object of threatening India and Stirring up trouble for England among the Uussalem Races of Turkestan, Afghanistan and Persia.A comparatively small military effort is necessary to carry out this programme.   The co-operation of Turkey is required in order to limit the activities of the British forces in Palestine and Mesopotamia.   Of these, the latter is the most dangerous owing to its psottmity to the Caspian Sea.   (Bagdad is 500 miles from Resht, where there 1* already a small English Force),    It will he well worth Gexwai^s while to,initiate operations from the Caucasus next Spring with the t&amp;^eot of clearing northern arid Central Persia of British troops and threatening the communications of the Mesopotamia^ 5&apos;orcee hy an advance further Sfou&amp;h.For the British, communications are had and there are no supplies in the country, so that they can only advance very slowly in either Theatre, and are a long way ttom any objective of first class importance.German policy seems, therefore, clearly indicated,(l)       Turkey must remain in the war, for which purpose German control of the Government is necessary, together with some reinforcement of the Turkish Armies.(2)       A defensive policy in Palestine and Mesopotamia,keeping the British Force occupied, and retiring step - hy step if they advance.(3)       To ohtain control of the Trans-Caucasian Hallways and, later, of the Caspian Sea, with the object of securing this route to the Eaat, and threatening India.(ft)       fflext Spring, If possible, offensive operations in H.W. Persia to drive the British out of  Eat&amp;atiaa and Heeht, and threaten the communications of the Bagdad Force.(signed)   H. WAKE,Brig&amp;dier-Gencral, Gr.S.1.
9 n kA.- PALESTINE.ghe*Qjgp09ing Fore03* . (See Appendix &quot;B&quot;).West of the Jordan the Turks have a Comhatftitt strength of about 52,500 men, including 2,000 Germans j and on the East of the Jordan they have about 28,000, including 1,800 Germans, which&apos;, together with their first reserve at and South of BAALBEK.of 4,000, gives them a total Combatant strength of 84,500 opposed to an Allied Combatant strength of 115,000.On the HgDJAZ Hallway South of Amman^ the Turks have a Combatant strength of about 9 to 10,000, opposed to Felsal&apos;s Forces consisting of about 3,500 Arabs, 8 guns, some British armoured cars and a few aeroplanes.At MEDINA a Turkish Force of between 4,000 and 5,000 rifle strength and 51 guns is more or less besieged by the Arab Forces under Abdulla and All, consisting of 3,000 trained Troops and about 50 guns of sort,3.General S1tuationjOn the main front between the Sea and the River JORDAN, the situation has been more or less quiesoont for many months, .\East of the JORDAN, since the British attack on AMMAN and jES-SALT in the early part of May, no operations of any importance have taken place, and with the exceptions of one or two raids, the British have remained behind their -   bridge-heads on the JORDAN..On the HEDJAZ Railway, Arab raids against the railway-, in which they have killed and taken prisoner a few hundred Turks, and torn up a few miles of line, are of weekly occurrence.    These raids, however, do not appear to have seriously interrupted the working of the railway.Lately a considerable increase in the dumber of Turkish deserters has been reported.At MEDINA the Turks still coed-able to feed themselves, though months ago they were, reported to be short of provisions,   &quot;if it had not been for the disinclination of the Arab troops to bombard the town, MEDINA would no doubt have fallen a long time ago.Factors affecting the iituation. .The chief factors affecting the situation in Palestine from the Turkish point of view, are as follows(a)   Man-Power *Besides the troops at CONSTANTINOPLE and in Asia Minor-, say 40,000 Combatants or 55,000 rations, Turkey has no available reinforcements for the Army in Palestine.(to)&apos; Moral. .The moral of the troops jj certainly not high, more especially apparently dittoing the potential reinforcing troops in Asia Minor, where mutinies on a serious scale have been reported of late;   but too .  much importance should not be placed on these incidents.   The Turkish troops may be relied on to put up a stubborn defence in their present positions and in a ret3.t-eme.T-l cause a British advance to be a costly and tedious business.&apos;/&quot;&apos;..- - 2 - (fc   Supply
(c)   Supply.li is believed that        more than 100,000 M combatanta can be maintained by the railwaysbetween the present Front and DAMASCUS. There arc now 84,600, so that presumably only 15,500 more could be brought into the Supply Area,The Army is supplied with corn from the rich corn growtng district of the Hauran, between DAMASCUS and DERAA, and the produce of this district is essential to the Turkish Armies in Palestine.  - A loss of these supplies (tho harvest should now all be gathered) would almost entail a withdrawal of tho Turkish line North of DAMASCUS *4.,Courses open to the Allies locally.The only objective, the loss of which might seriously Influence the policy of Turkey, is ALEPPO, distant more than 300 miles from the present Allied Front.It is considered that not more than 4 Divisions extra to those already on this front can be maintained by tho Allies.   This number would not give the1 Allies a sufficiently large numerical superiority to ensure the capture of ALEPPO, unless operations elsewhere &apos; compelled, the Turks to withdraw a considerable proportion Of their force from this fuiko&amp;A    For this operation a large amount of railway material^ rolling stock, etc., is required, and would       have to come chiefly from India.* Courses, open to the Central ftowers locally *The present inferiority of the Turkish forces in Palestine, which owing to limited railway capacity is not likely to bo materially changed, makes an attack on a large scale out of the^uestion, as long as the British strength is maintained.   It may therefore be expected that the ^urks will remain on the defensive and watch the situation.Should the Allies recommence their delayed offensive, the Turks will fall back disputing every yard of ground to the TUL&amp;KERAM - NABLUS line-on the West of the JORDAN, and to the broken hilly country North of the NAHJUEZ-ZERKA river on the Saat of the JORDAN.Their next line of resistance will be on the W. of tho JORDAN on the line CARMEL - BEIT LAHJH:-,NAZARETH - EL MURUSSUS.     This line is North of the Plain of ESDBAELON, where a certain amount of wheat is grown which should, by this time of the year, have been harvested.The country to the East of the JORDAN is so broken and difficult that a few Turks should easily be able to prevent British Forces making much progress on that side-..&quot;B&quot; MESOPOTAMIA.
&quot;B&quot;.   MESOPOTAMIA.377For details of Opposing Forces see Appendix nB%(i)      Yurkish. Forces.&quot; Vhe Turkish forces in Mesopotamia consist of 21,400 Combatants (ration strength 32,300) distributed on the EUPHRATES, TIGRIS, KIRKUK and SULEIMANIEH Front, with a email reserve at MOSUL, these numbers being exclusive of troops operating In Persia.The Turks are withdrawing their forces opposite the British in a Northeasterly direction Into North-West Persia and the Caucasus.    This is $1early shewn by a comparison of the War Office dispositions on 14th Maroh and 27th June, of Turkish Forces usually considered as available for operations against the British Forces in Mesopotamia^TIGRIS Front EUPHRATES . SULEIEANIJH KILFRI KIRKUKMOSUL Reserveso;.; ...* * i14tu torch.. 12&quot;, 200 4,500io,-eoo4,10027th June. 11,000 2,9006,2002,9003jL 300.25,000This shews.a reduction of 7,300 Turks in Mesopotamia whereas a comparison of the numbers in AZERBAIJAN on the same dates, viz:-14th March.27th June.3^000 10,000,shews an increase of 7,000 drawn from the Mesopotamian Front(ii)    British Forces.The&apos;BritiWforces on this front consist of 150,600 Combatants (ration strength 400,000).Excluding the forces employed on the EUPHRATES, TIGRIS and KURTJ&amp; Defences and all L. of C. troops, the purely active British force has a ration strength of roughly 107,200, of whom 43,000 are British and 8,000 are Cavalry.From these numbers must be deducted the troops employed on the BMDAD-HAEADAH-RESHT Boad, viz: 1 Brigade of Infantry 1 Brigade of Artillery, 1 Squadron of Cavalry and some armoured cars.iOHimuniv^at^ons as affecting Reinforcements/.(i)      Turkish Communications.1 From calculations made at the War Office in January, 1918, it was considered that the maximum number of men the Turks could maintain, opposite the British in Mesopotamia, was 27,000 rifles - 37,000 Combatants; but jt must&apos;be borne in mind that last year&apos;s harvest in that district was a failure.Under the most favourable conditions, as regards the present harvest, it is considered that the Turks could not possibly maintain more than 36,000 rifles, or 50,000 Combatants, on this Front.&apos;4Even
- 5 *o o d 6 0Even, on the-aamrcsption that the Germane could spare trcH?p^htext year to send to the assistance of the Turks, with the limited neana-ef communications at present at their disposal it is not conoeivable that they could concentrate a sufficiently large force in the vicinity of MOSUL to be able to dislodge the British from their present position.The completion of the BAGEAD Railway to MOSUL would seem to be the ottly means of improving their communications within a reasonable period.The opening of the Black Sea Line of Communioa-tions from CONSTANTINOPLE or CONSTANZA te BATUM and thence by the Trans-Caucasian Railway, with its extensions into North-West Persia, will not assist, the Turks in their operations against the British in Mesopotamia unless the latter push Northwards to the Cauoaaua.The old Turkish Lines of Communication by the BAGDAD Railway:To JSRABLUS, thence down the EUPHRATES by road and water:To TEL HELIF, thence by road, either, direct to J.&amp;SUL, or to JT8SIRB - IBN - OMAR, thence by river to MOSUL; wuld still remain the best and shortest -(ii)   Brit ish Communications .&quot;   Owing to the&quot;length and insufficiency of their communications, the British cannot hope to strike a serious blow from BAGDAD against the Turks.     Should they advance to MOSUL, it is probable that they would only be opposed by weak rear guards and would nsver have an opportunity ef inflicting a decisive defeat on the enemy.3v Courses open to the Allies Locally.In spite of the numerical superiority of the British o*&apos; this front and their laek of an immediate objective, the Allies are not likely to reduce the size of the r$roe in view of the purposes for which.it may eventually be required in the direction of the Caucasus and the CASPIAN, and in co-operation with Allied policy in Russia.A British advance on MOSUL might be undertaken this Autumn.    The troops in Persia will probably be reinforced with the object ef. consolidating their position in RE3SHT and pushing forward  towards the Caucasus;   possibly even te BAKU should the situation permit.4. Courses open to the Central Powers Locally.An offensive against the British, with a view t$ driving them out ef BAGDAI, is out of the question, with the troops at the disposal of the Turks, whose oily course therefore, is to aceept the situation a* it ie, trusting to regain their lost Provinces in Mesopotamia at the Peace Conference.    Meanwhile, they will employ their forcoe more profitably elsewhere, by extending thel** Empire Eastwards into the AZERBAIJAN Province of Persia, in order te link up with the Turkish-speaking Tartare in Turkestan, and also to consolidate their position in Trans-Caucaela.Should the British resume their forward move on MOSUL the Turks will not attempt seriously to dispute their advance, but by fighting a series of rear-guard aotioae endeavour to delay their progress and eauae them as mueh less as possible, knowing that MOSUL must be the extreme limiit of the British advanee.MCM PERSIA.5 -
"C" PERSIA.

1.Opposing, Forces.

For Table of Opposing Force see  Appendix "B".

2. Situation in North-Western Persia.

(i) Turks.

The Turkish troops in Persia number about 2\\1//2 to 3 Divisions, say 10,000 rifles and 14,000 Combatants.   The majority of those troops originally belonged to the Turkish Mesopotamian Force opposing the British that have within the last few months been moved into Persia.

Their furthest extension Eastward and Southward is indicated by the following places of which they are reported to be in occupation :-

On the ALEXANDROPOL-TABRIZ Branch of Trans-Caucasian Railway. (JULFA on the Perso-Caucasian Frontier.

( MARAND, where it is reported the Turks have lately been in conflict with some Tartars.

( TABRIZ, terminus of the railway.

MARAGHA, West of Lake URMIA.

SUJ BULAK, South of lake URMIA.

SAKIZ, 40 miles S.S.E. of SUJ BULAK.

SINNA, 70 miles S,S,E, of SAKIZ.

From SINNA, whence runs a fair road Southwards to KERMANSHAH, it was reported the Turks were moving towards the latter place, and that a British Force was being sent from KERMANSHAH to oppose them.

Turkish troops are known to be all along the West of lake URMIA from PITMAN at the N.W. of the Lake and so far South as SUMFIMANIEH.

Since their entry into that part of Persia between Lakes VAN and URMIA and Southward as far as SULEINANIEH, the Turks have had numerous encounters, with varying success, against the pro-Ally forces called Jelus, and with Armenians, who, together number roughly about 10,000 rifles.

(ii) British.

The British have established a line of posts, from the Right flank of their forces in Mesopotamia, along the BAGDAD-KASR-I?SHIRIN-KERMANSHAH-HAMADAN-RESHT Road and are in possession of the Port of ENZELI on the CASPIAN?

The total strength of their forces along this road are :-

1 Squadron of Cavalry.

1 Brigade of Artillery.

1 Brigade of Infantry.

1 Armoured Car Detachment with 40 cars.

1,000 Infantry as Ford Car Crews.

1 Flight of Aeroplanes.

In addition to these British forces, there are 1,200 Russians under General Bicharakoff, who are operating on the extreme Right of the British and are now at RESHT. A total of, roughly, 5,000 men.

The object of the British in maintaining this line of posts is twofold:

Firstly: In the event of gaining control of the CASPIAN Fleet to be able to pass troops along it to RESHT and thence by sea to Trans-Caucasia.

Secondly
Secondly : To prevent Turkish and German agents in bands from passing into Central Persia and Eastwards round the South of the CASPIAN Sea into Turkestan. (Re CASPIAN Sea, see para. D.(d) and Appendix  A).

In addition to the above force there are in the country different tribes such as Jangalis, Sinjabis, Gurans, etc., etc., some pro-British and some pro-Turk, but whose fighting value is not of much importance.

3. Factors affecting the Situation.

The factors which affect the situation in Persia are :-

(a) The possession of maritime control in the CASPIAN affects, more than any other, factor, the situation, not only in Persia but in the Caucasus, Russia and Turkestan.

(b) The British cordon along the BAGDAD-HAMADAN-RESHT road is the only means by which British troops can be  moved to the shores of the CASPIAN and thence by sea to BAK?.

The present line of communications of this cordon being in prolongation of the British Right flank in Mesopotamia is most insecure, and liable to be pierced and the troops holding the outward half of the cordon driven off their line of retreat.

It has been calculated that not more than 10 - 15,000 man can be maintained on this road in its present condition, and that 5,000 of these could be supplied from local resources.

(c) The amount of rolling stock at the disposal of the Turks on the railway between ALEXANDROPOL and TABRIZ  may be limited. The condition of the roads from TABRIZ Southwards to KERMANS?A, HAMADAN and TE?ERAN is fair only, and the amount of supplies which can be collected locally are probably not large.

(d) The attitude of the Persian Government; though this applies more to Middle and Southern Persia perhaps than it does in the North-Western portion of the country. A Government, however, openly hostile to the British would render their hold on the BAGDAD-RESHT Road a troublesome and costly business.

4. Courses open to the Central Powers Locally.

The Turks can hardly be in a position to under-take an offensive in 1918 against the British line of posts on the HAMADAN- RESHT Road. During the Autumn and Winter they will endeavour to recruit and train as many as possible of the pro-Turk population in AZERBAIJAN. If their efforts in this direction meet with success, by May, 1919, when the roads should be free of snow, they may fool themselves strong enough to attempt an offensive.

While this period of organisation and training is going on in Persia, German and Turkish agents Will be busy intriguing with the tribes in rear of tho British in Persia and also in Turkestan. Raids against the British posts on tho BAGDAD - HAMADAN - RESHT Road will also no doubt be constantly carried out.


By the and of April, 1919, the Germany may be able to send Divisions, which would be concentrated in the vicinity of TABRIZ. As soon as the roads are opened after the Winter snow we may expect an advance against the British cordon, from XASR-I-SHIRIN to RESHT. The forces at the enemy&apos;s disposal might amount to 8 Turkish Divisions say 4,5,000 Combatants, plus 20,000 Tartars of AZERBAIJAN and 2 German Divisions of 35,000 Combatants, a total of 100,000 Combatants based en TABRIZ.

Simultaneously with the commencement of this advance from the North a pre-arranged rising of the persian tribes in rear of the British may take place, and the march of the Tartars from Turkestan along the Southern Shores of the CASPIAN commence.

The result of these operations might well be the defeat of the British Forces in Persia and cause the Persian Government openly to throw in its lot with the Central Powers. The result of this action on the part of Persia would be a serious threat to the British line of communications in Mesopotamia, thus placing the British troops at BAGDAD in a position of grave danger.

Courses open to the Allies Locally.

The possible employment of the Allied Forces, which must be drawn largely from the Mesopotamian Force, is as follows :-

(i) The immediate improvement of communications with RESHT, i.e. the construction of a railway at least as far as HAMADAN.

(ii) The establishment of a strong force at RESHT.

(iii) Energetic action with flying columns on the CASPLAN litteral with BAKU, and its oilfields, as a special objective.

(iv) The organisation of new lines of communication through Persia, running more directly at right angles to the British Front in Persia than the present week one in prolongation of the Right flank in Mesopotamia.

"D" CAUCASUS.


*Dtt CAUCASUS.1, Oppofling Forces.For Table of Opposing Forces Bee Appendix &quot;I&quot;.2. The Situation..(a) Political.&apos; By the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk the former Russian provinces of Batum, Ardahen and Kars were, without the consent ef the inhabitants, to be handed over to the Turks.   The Turkish advance commenced in the middle o  February and by the middle ef April these three provinces hod been occupied.It was not the intention of the Germans that the Turk3 should extend Eastwards beyond the limits of the three above-mentioned provinces, as they wish to reserve the resources of the Eastern Caucasus, which include the valuable oil-wells in the BAKU district, for themselves.This rivalry between the Germans and Turks has led to scheming by both parties with the local, so-called, Governments, the details of which are too long to go into-, and it is very difficult to arrive at any certainty as to who is on each side.However, although disputes between the Germans and Turks may affect the situation as between those twt nations, it does not fellow that they will dpi s^ to the advantage of the Allied powers.   For example,&quot; the Armenians and Russians garrisoning the BAKU district are reported to have stated that they would be willing te hand over the town to &quot;the Germans but that they would burn it down rather than let the Turks take it.In any event, these differences between Germans and Turks will presumably be settled at COPSTAITTINOPLB and can have little effect on the general situation.(b)pi positions:- germ an.Between POTI and TIFLIS the Germans have some 1,000 &quot;Ukraine&quot; troops, probably released prisoners, and at TIFLIS they have 2 Regular Battalions.Turks.The Turks haye&apos; a force in tho Caucasus of 6 Divisions of about 18,000 rifles and 56,000 Combatant strength, and -   possibly 15,000 Kurds and Tartars may havo joined them; but how they are distributed cannot be said with any accuracy.Anti-Turkish Elements.The anti-Turk forces in the Caucasus cannot be stated with certainty, and it is not by any means sure that they are all anti-German as well as anti-Turk.   The latest information gives 18,000 Armenians - under Andronik, the Armenian hero and patriet - in the ALEXANDROPQL -33RIVAK districts - it was reported lately that BRIVAN had been re-taken by the Armenians, - and at BAKU there are 10,000 Armenians end 15,000 Russians (Eolsheviks?).The Allies have, up te the present time, not been able to send any assistance, other than money, to the anti-Turk forces in the Caucasus, and unless they gain control of the CASPIAN will not be able to do so.(o) Communlc at ions,Tlie Germans hold POTI ( a port on the Eastern BLACK SKA, 35 miles N. of BATUM) and control the railway line from there to TIFLIS.   The railway from BATUM (in Turkish hands) joins the POTI - TIFLIS line at SANTRLDI (55 miles F,. of POTI).   As the whole of the line fromPOTI3R?*9-
POTI to TIFLIS is in German hands they are able to out off the Turks from railway communications f . Eastwards and BATUti thus becomes of little value.The Turks control the branch railways leading S. from TIFLIS Westwards via ALEXANDROPOL *&apos;0 SARIKAMISH and South-Eastwards via AIXvANDROPQL to TABRIZ in Persia; but only as far North as KALAGERAN (52 miles S. of TIFLIS).      They have, however, cut across country fromKARAKLIS (.12 miles S. of KALAGERAN) by a good road to AKSTAFA,&quot; on the main BATUK - TIFLIS, - BAKU Railway (called the IBtans-Caspian Railway) and have advanced along it as far as KURDAMIR 100&apos;miles by rail from BAKU.By the railway from ROSTOV-on-DON (now in the hands of the Germans) through CIS - CAUCASIA round the Eastorn end of tho Caucasus mountains to BAKU, tho Germans could quickly transport troops to that Port, provided they controlled the whole of the line between these two places.It was reported lately that Alexieff&apos;s Corps of Cossacks, about 9,000 strong, were along the line between STAV0R0P0L and VLADIKAVKAS.The Georgian Road from VLADIKAVKAS over the Caucasus mountains to TIFLIS gives another means of access to Trans-Caucasia from the liorth; but as a line of communications it is not to be compared to tho Sea Route to BATTH or POTI and the Trans-Cauoasian Railway.(d) The Caspian.!thc control of the CASPIAN is the factor which dominates the whole situation in the Eastern portion and perhaps eventually in the whole of the Caucasus.With the control in the hands of the Central powers the Allies havo no means of getting into touch with any pro-Ally forces in the Caucasus or rendering them any assistance from the South.The whole of the ships on the CASPIAN, or at any rate the two gun boats and a large proportion of the merchant fleet is under the control of the Armenians and Russians at BAKU, who arc said to be anxious to hand these vessels over to the British.The Russian General Bicharakoff, who is in command of a force of Russians co-oporating with the British in Persia, now in occupation of the port of EHZIJLI, has arrived at BAKU by sea from ENZELI with a view to tho purchase of the vessels on behalf of the British.   It is not yet known with what success his efforts hove met.   Possibly about 6 ships which wore at EliZELI have boon handed over to him.2. Courses open to tho Central Powers.Tho objects fo* which the Turkish Government seems to be working in the Caucasus arc:-firstly:   The creation of a vast Turkish Empire extending from CONSTANTINOPLE through Anotolia, N. and S. of the Caucasus mountains oncircling the CASPIAN Sea, to, include the Persian province of AZERBAIJAN,, passing along the Northern Frontier of Afghanistan as far as Chinese Turkestan.Secondly;-10-
Having recruited the inhabitants of those countries, to re-conqucr Mesopotamia,To obtain tho raw materials of the Caucasus for her own use.The objects of the Germans areTo obtain the cotton, oil, minerals and other raw materials of the Caucasus for their own use,To induce the Moslem population of Persia, Turkestan and Afghanistan to attack the British, and to cause a mutiny in India.Through her power over tho Turkish Government to extend her influence over tho whole of the East.In order that either power may obtain its desires, the first course open to thorn is to compose their differences and come to an understanding as to their future action.Their next course will bo to push forward tc BAKU and gain control of the CASPIAN.   If they work loyally together they have sufficient forces available for this purpose.Unless tho situation on the Western Front takes a distinctly more, favourable turn for the Germs during 1919, it is certain that they will not be able to send many troops Eastward.   Should tho Allies, by intervention in Siberia and Northern Russia, succeed in creating an Eastern Front against Germany, the latter will not by able to spare troops to push fon;ard in a hostile country along tho ROSTOV-on-DON - VLAD1KAVKAS - BAKU Railway, N, of the Caucasus mountains, nor by road along the Northern Shore of the BLACK &apos;Soa.Should they fail in securing control of the CASPIAN their efforts must bo confined to thoroughly subduing the hostile el-emonts among the population of the Caucasus.   Having done this, they can proceed to organise an Army from among the pro-Turk populace and towards the middle of 1919, should bo in a position to undertake a serious offensive against the British in Persia and rcsopotemia. (See part 0,(5),)potion open to the Allies Locally,It is essential to the Allies1 cause in the Caucasus that they should obtain maritime control of the CASPIAN Sea, and we may expect therefore, that this will bo their first object.Once control of tho CASPIAN is in their hands, they should be in a position to pass troops by sea from KESHT to BAKU and, with the assistance of the local anti-Turk tribes, form a rallying point for ell pro-Allied forces throughout tho whole of Caucasia, both Korthand South of the mountains; thus reconstituting an Allied Front in Southern ilussia, which should bar all further German and Turkish expansion Iiastward3.&quot;B&quot; TUXKESTAKthirdly;-11-
SJt 9 p.&quot;E&quot;. TURKESTAN AND THS INDIAN FRONTIER. Opposing Forces.It Is impossible to give at all on accurate estimate-of the number of men under arms in Turkestan, or indeed how the different bodies are grouped.   An attempt has been made in Appendix &quot;Bw to give a list of those forces which might be considered as likely to be in opposition, but the actual numbers are entirely conjectural4The Situation and factors affecting It,(I) Turkestan and Bokhara.Since the outbreak of the Russian Revolution Turkestan has been in a state of chaos, outline Province of Bokhara only does there appear to have been much fighting.Until the fall of Kerensky affairs in Bokhara were fairly peaceful, but on the rise to power of the Bolshevik Government, the local Russian Colonists, imbued with Bolshevik doctrines, succeeded in gaining the upper hand, after considerable bloodshed and destruction of property.In the North, at TASHKEND, General Dutoff had a force of anti-Bolshevik Cossacks; they have had several encounters with tho Bolsheviks&apos; In which the latter m&amp; reported to have suffered reverses.The Amir of Bokhara has lately been trying to reorganise his forces, and *:.... should he be able to obtain arms, ought to be able to overthrow the Bolshevik regime, as he has the support of all the surrounding;. Moslem populations.In April there were 38,000 Austrian,and German prisoners of war in Turkestan; but It iOhown how many are actually In the country at the present moment, nor does it appear that they have taken any part in the late hostilities.The Amir of Afghanistan has remained neutral throughout, in spite of repeated appeals for assistance tVGnCthe Amir of Bokhara,The factors which will affect the situation in Turkestan in the near future, are tho control of:-(a) The Caspian Sea,(Appendix &quot;A&quot;).(b) The Central Asian Railway  rom KRASNOVODSK,on the Eastern Shore of the CASPIAN, to ANDIJAN In the Province of Bokhara,(c) SAMARA - the junction of the Trans-Siberianand the SAMARA - ORENBURG - TASHKEND Railways,(II) Baluchistan,The British maintain . a chain of posts through Eastern Persia   along the Afghan Frontier, commencing from the head of the QUETTA - BALUCHISTAN Railway at MIR JAM. on tho Persian Frontier of BALUCHISTAN, to MESHED (60 miles from the Turkestan Frontier,)(***) North-East Persia,The garrison of MESHED and tho posts between tnat place and MIRJAWA consist of a total force of i-1 Segt. Indian Cavalry.      1 Section Mountain Arty, h Coy, Sappers &amp; Miners,    1,700 Persian Levies, l! Battalions of Indian Infantry,Although MESHED and the cordon of posts are entirely in Persian territory, their raison d&apos;etre is, from MESHED, to influence the course of affairs in Turkestan, more especially along tho Trans-Caspian Railway, In order to deny this rou^e to German and Turkish agents seeking to stir up anti-British feeling In Turkestan and Afghanistan.- 12 - (lv) Afghanistan
Afghaniatan end IndiaThe situation for theTrioment^dn Afghanistan is quiet.    How long it will remain sc no-one oan say, nor. should unrest break out, in which direction a movement will take place, either Northwards for the recapture of the PANJDEH Province, or Southwards against India.Should tho move take a Northerly direction, there 13 little or no Russian Force io withstand it and whether the Amir of MERV would do so is Unknown to the writer.Southwards the, Indian Frontier is strongly defended, and by the system of railways along the Frontier, easily reinforced.(v)   The Baluchistan Frontier of India.An attack on India through South-Eastern Persia and Baluohistan need not bo considered seriously, as the mountainous character of the country would prevent any but the smallest bodies of troops operating through it.Action open to the Allies Locally.From their post at MESHED the Allies will endeavour to create a pro-Allied feeling among the inhabitants of Turkestan and also to establish a pro-Allied force at KRASNOVODSK, on the Eastern Shore of the CASPIAN Sea(Appendix &quot;A&quot;).They can also organise preparations for the  ; destruction of the Trans-Caspian Railway, should tho danger of this line falling into hostile hands become Imminent *Beyond these measures there is very little the Allies can,do locally.Courses open to the Central Powers Locally.Without the control of the CASPIAN Sea (Appendix &quot;A&quot;) route, or of the SAMARA Railway, the Central Powers cannot pass any armed forces into the country. They, no doubt, will endeavour to gain control of both; not only from the military point of view, but in order to tap the Gauntry of Its large supplies of cotton and other raw materials.Until they can avail themselves of either one 0 other of these two means of ingress, they will be compelled to confine themselves to passing agents, German livSL Turk&amp;sh, Into the country with a view to stirring up Anti-British feeling throughout the whole of Central Asia.ILGeneral- 13 &quot;*
II.   GENERAL POLICY OF THE ALLIESAs the Allies are not able, except through Thrace, to strike at the vital centres of Turkish Military power, and can only strike rather feebly, owing to the inadequacy of their moans of communication, at the extremities, it would so em therefore, a wise policy on their part to conserve their resources for use in other Theatres.In the Caucasus only does it appear that vigorous offensive policy, with a view to the reconstitution of an Allied Front in South Pussia, would be justified.    The difficulties in the way of success here aro certainly great, but the effort seems to be worth while.In no other Theatre of Operations does a prospect of being able to strike a decisive blow against some, vitally strategic point present itself.     Therefore the policy to be adopted will no doubt, generally speaking, bo a defensive one. i    , *At the same time the importance of vigorous propaganda campaign at CONSTANTINOPLE, among tho Turkish troops, and among the Native Chiefs in Arabia, Persia and Turkestan should not bo lost sight of.III.   GENERAL POLICY OP THE CENTRAL POWERS.With the forces that are likely to be available, an offensive by the Central Powers in Palestine or Mesopotamia during the Autumn of 1918 or winter 1918/1919 is extremely unlikely.    Germany will send such reinforcements to Turkey as will ensure that the Turks maintain their two fronts against the British, and, in the event of a serious attack, fall back fighting and disputing any advance.The loss of DAMASCUS would have a serious moral effort on the Turks, but neither this place nor MOSUL are, strategically speaking, of very great importance to the cause of the Central powers.In the Caucasus and Persia, during 1918 and Winter of 1918/1919, operations againsi/Tocal inhabitants only will be pursued, in the former case with a view to the capture of BAKU, and in the latter to subdue local hostility and consolidate the position.In 1919 the same defensive policy in Palestine, Mesopotamia and the Caucasus will probably commend itself; but in Persia, with the assistance of 2 German Divisions and such lecal forces as Turkey may.be able to recruit on the spot during the Winter, the Central Powers should be in a position to attempt a serious offensive against the British in Persia In April or May.The defeat of the British in North-West Persia weuld alraest certainly bring the Persian Government and people openly en the side of the Central Powers.    The British Lines of Communication in Mesopotamia would be seriously threatened, and a withdrawal from BAGHDAD essential, unless the position could be restored.In Turkestan the Central powers can do little during the coming Autumn and Winter, beyond a vigorous propaganda against the British, and by the loan of expert military advisers.    By the Spring they may be able to bring an army of Tartars, stiffened by the German prisoners new in the country, to co-operate with the columns advancing from the Notth.- 14 -
0 0Jog&quot;A&quot;$ THE CASPIAN SEA.V&apos; gesQription^The extreme length of the CASPIAN Sea is 630 miles, and its width varies from 300 miles in its Northern portion to 125 miles from APSE2B0N GAB (on the Western Coast) to the nearest point on the Eastern Coast,The CASPIAN Sea consists of throe basins.    The Northern basin is very shallow, its bottom being a continuation of tho almost imperceptible-slops of the steppe.   The maximum depth of tho middle basin is 421 fathoms, but there is a submarine ridge between the APSHERON CcPE and the MANGLISHLAK Peninsular with an average depth of 30 fathoms.   South of this ridge is the Southern basin with a maximum depth of - 5&amp;6 fathoms.The Northern portion of the CASPIAN freezes for 3 or 4 months along the shore;   ice only eppears in the middle portion when brought by Northern winds.    1CRASNOV0D3K is 1 occasionally closed by drift toe.2. River Communications.By moans of tho River VOLGA, with the Canals connecting that Rivor with ,other navigable rivers, the Caspian Sea is in direct navigable water communication with the Baltic Sea, tho Arctio Gcesn, and, except for a distance of 50 miles by railway between I2&amp;RIT3IN. on the VOLGA and  ALACH on the direr DON, with the BLACK Sea.TheURAL River from Its source flows past OKSK, ORENBURG, URALSK, to GORISV art its mouth, but it only navigable for rafts,3, Ports-On the Western Shore are the following Ports:-FETR0V8K and DSRBEBT (both on the ROSTOV-on-DON - BAKU Railway). BAKU, the junction of the ROSTOV-on-DON - BAKU and the Trans-Caspian Railways.BAKU is the best Port on the CASPIAN Sea.   It has a line of quays for a distance of about 4 miles from whioh about 14 piers project into the see, thus facilitating the embarkation and disembarkation of troops, stores and material of all kinds,Further South, on the Persian Shore, there are the rattier indifferent and exposed-ports of LENKORAN &amp;nd   . ASTARA, to neither of whioh can large ships approach nearer than 2 or 3 miles on account of the shallow nature of their approaches.The next Port to the youth, for the moment tho moat important one for the British, is B2USLI, the Port for RESET at the end of the BAGDAD - HAiviADAN - RESET Road,   The only means, of. communication between the British Forces in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus at present is via this Road to EN2SLI, thence b  &apos;ooe to BAKU.- 15 -
On the South Shore th^re--4o^not aopear to toe any ^orts nor awmnijQ&amp;tL^^ to tho Coast.On the $astern Shore is the important Port of XRA2NOV0DSK, the Western terminus of the CentraiLAsisn Hallway.   KRASNOVODSK has tho best harbour on tho Eastern Shores&quot; of tho Caspian.    The Bay on which the town stands is easily accessible to ships drawing twelve feet of water up to a distance of 200 yards from tho shore.    The approach from the South is wide and deep, being about fifteen feet at 250 yards from the Shore.    The harbour is frozen for very short periods only, and not every Winter.The dManee between the Ports of BAKU and KRASNOVODSK is 120 miles, and between BAJOJ and ENZSLI, the Port for RESHT, in Persia, is 180 miles.Vessels on the CASPIAN.In 1914 the vessels on the Caspian Sea consistedof:-2 Gun-boats.2 Despatch-boats.Some Auxiliary vessels.240 steamers of a total registeredtonnage of 106,271 tons. 570 sailing ships of a total registeredtonnage of 112,191 tons.No later information than this is available and it is not known where these vessels are at tho present time.
