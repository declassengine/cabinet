13 QDocument is the Property-of His Britannic Majestys Government]CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,[July 22, 1918.] Foreion OFFICE.Germany /Oil.MEMORANDUM$2$^ ONKUHLMANNS RESIGNATION.1. THE resignation of Herr vonKtihlmann and the appointment of Admiral von Hintze as his successor cast a good deal of light upon the present conduct of German affairs. In one aspect these events represent the success of long preparations and efforts on the part of the &quot; small, but mighty party,&quot; the Prussian Conservatives in the Reichstag, who have kept in touch with Tirpitz and the Pan-Germans and also, as usual, with the Higher Command of the Army. On the other hand, the military situation, the state of Russia, diplomatic difficulties with Turkej&apos; and Bulgaria, and the personal character and weaknesses of Herr von Kuhlmanii have brought matters to a head and have facilitated the final coup.2. The circumstances in which Kiihlmann was appointed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will be borne in mind. It was when Bethmann Hollweg fell under the attacks of the Prussian Conservatives, who could not stand his liberalising policy at home and his acceptance of the draft of. the &quot;Peace by Understanding &quot; resolution.* Ktihlmann&apos;s predecessor, Zimmermann, had been discredited by the collapse and exposure of thy German intrigues in America and the absurd attempt to incite Mexico, and, through Mexico, Japan (!), against the United States. Bethmann ITollweg had evidently lost the confidence of the Higher Command, which resented his attempt to shake the power of their parliamentar)&apos; friends by the Prussian Equal-Franchise Bill The appointment of Michaelis, an excellent Prussian official but no politician or parlia-mentarian, was a sop to the Conservatives and the Higher Command, and meant that the attempt was to be made to govern the Empire by purely bureaucratic methods.The Imperial Chancellor is the Minister of the Empire for Foreign Affairs. Constitutionally speaking, the Secretary of State is his subordinate and his represen-tative. Michaelis was practically ignorant of foreign affairs, and it was necessary to. appoint a Secretary of State who could exercise that control and initiative which, for different reasons, Baron Marschall von Bieberstein had exercised under Caprivi and under Prince Hohenlohe in the nineties, and which Bulow had exercised during the latter part of Hohenlohe&apos;s Chancellorship, preparatory to his own elevation to the highest office. Kublmann was selected as the &quot; best horse in the diplomatic stable &quot; young (he was only 45), clever, and fresh from several years&apos; experience of Germany&apos;s &quot;chief enemy,&quot; England. His known ambition was probably regarded as a gage for his subserviency, but he, doubtless, gave express assurances to the Higher Command, particularly Ludendorff, who had by that time established his position as the political brain of the army. On the other hand, he was acceptable to the Majority Parties of the Reichstag, to the Catholic Centre, to the Radicals, and even, in some degree, to the Majority Socialists as a man who had not been born and bred in a Prussian atmosphere (he is a Bavarian) and who realised the connection of international politics with business interests. When Michaelis&apos; brief and inglorious Chancellorship ended, Kiihlmann was thus able to play an important part in smoothing the way for his successor. The Majority of the Reichstag had asserted itself and had demanded from Hertling assurances that its home and foreign policy should be adhered to as a condition of its support. Kiihlmann was able to convey such assurances and to obtain in return the promise of the Majority leaders&apos; backing.3. But Hertling is a very different man from Bethmann Hollweg and from Michaelis. He is not nearly so impressionable or so accessible to ideas as the fifth Chancellor, nor is he so bureaucratic in his outlook and unadaptable as the sixth. He was for many years the leading spokesman of the Centre on foreign affairs in the Reichstag, and he has a German parliamentarian^ knowledge of the subject.    Hertling insisted upon* Bethmann Hollweg had at the same time lost the confidence of the Left on account of the ambiguity of his utterances.[367-28]
retaining personal control of the Foreign Office, so that Kiihlmann&apos;s task was complicated by the necessity of keeping the Chancellor informed and securing his approval while at the sime time maintaining touch with the Hiffher Command.4. His difficulties began at Brest-Li to vsk. He was at first suspected of excessive complaisance towards the Bolsheviks and afterwards of driving too hard a bargain with them, in order to obtain compensation in advance for a &quot; peace of renunciation&quot; on the West. The probability is that the Higher Command was determined to nip in the bud any tendency to barter away what it had gained with the sword, and that it considered a policy of annexation and extension of German influence in the East the best earnest and pledge of a similar policy in the West. The Eastern peace was a military peace, as was shown not merely by the presence of General Hoffmann and his peremptory tone at the negotiations, but by the practice, which from that date became invariable, of describing everything that was done by the Foreign Office as having been done in accordance with the views of the Higher Command.5. At first Kiihlmann obtained considerable credit with the mass of the Majority parties for the Brest-Litovsk and the Eoumanian Treaties. These treaties, which admittedly involved infringements of the Reichstag &quot; Peace Resolution,&quot; were&apos; set down to military and reactionary influences, which he had been unable to resist. Subsequently, when the German offensives in the West were regarded as heralding final victory, the &quot; Peace Resolution &quot; itself was allowed to fall into abeyance by many even of its advocates. The Eastern peace was for a time believed to have secured for Germany enormous economic advantages for the remoter future, and for the immediate future a relief from the menace of famine. When the one gain began to look problematical, owing to the spread of complete anarchy in Russia, and the other evaporated, owing to agrarian and political conditions in the Ukraine, Kiihlmann rapidly lost the support of the Left and ,of the Democratic wing of the Clerical Centre. His position thus approximated to that in which Bethmann Hollweg had found himself before his fall: he was the target of the Right and had lost the support of the Centre and the Left. It is true that the Left rallied to him on the occasion of that speech of his (the 24th June) which furnished the final occasion of his overthrow. But this rally of the Left was half-hearted and, both psychologically and politically, it came too late. The position of Ludendorff as political arbiter had been firmly established by general consent or acquiescence; while the Kaiser had, as his recent speeches show, relapsed into a purely military posture and into congenial dependence upon his military advisers.6. The influence of the relations between Germany arid Austria-Hungary upon Kuhlmann&apos;s fortunes is a more obscure chapter. It may be that the fall of Czernin had deprived him of his partner in the diplomatic game, and that he was not in sympathy with the wider schemes of Mittel-Europa which are now being officially pressed by Germany and resisted by Hungary.&apos; It was noteworthy that the chief spokesman of the German Government, where preparations for the new Austro-German Treaty were concerned, has been the Vice-Chancellor von Payer, and not Kuhlmann.With Czernin, Kiihlmann was also linked in his preference for private overtures and exchanges of views behind the scenes, and the employment of confidential agents for sounding the Allies. In his final speech of the 25th June, the one in which he attempted to tone down his utterances of the previous day, he still maintained that public declarations were of little use, and that &quot;nothing remains but the method of confidential or diplomatic contact.&quot; The presence of a large number of talkative German agents in neutral countries, especially in Switzerland, illustrated this policy. It will be interesting to see whether it is pursued or abandoned under Ktthlmanns successor.7. As to the immediate occasion of Kuhlmann&apos;s fall, his speech on the 24th June, the full history of the origin of that speech cannot at this stage be written. The prevailing opinion is that such statements as &quot;an absolute end cannot be expected through military decisions alone, without diplomatic negotiations,&quot; and the depressing reference to old Moltke&apos;s forecast of a possible seven-years&apos;, or even thirty-years&apos; war were not made without the consent of Ludendorff and, it is added in some quarters, of Hertling. The suggestion has even been made that Ludendorff allowed Kuhimann to make the statements, knowing well that they wrould prove fatal to him. The more probable explanation is that Ludendorff and even the Higher Command wanted fcfa.8 excessive optimism of the nation to be damped down, in view of the diffi-culiiec oi&quot; the Western offensive. Kuhlmann, in this view, had received permission,, or even inst-.net-ions to perform this office. But he exceeded his instructions, or carried them out in a manner which produced too great depression among his audience and in the CQiatry.   0&apos;cst le ton qui fait la musique.   It may be that leading members of the
1343German Foreign Office, which has always chafed under military interference, recom-lnended Kuhlmann to make the most of Ludendorffs permission, and that his own inclination jumped with the advice. In themselves, his statements were mere truisms. It was their setting and the discouragement which was beginning ro spread in view of the Eastern imbroglio and the long delay in the Western offensive that gave the speech the aspect of an expression of despondency. An impossible situation was created when the military censorship issued with the report of the speech an instruction to the press that it was not to be interpreted as a denial of trie possibility of peace, by victory. It at once became imperative that the civil Government should either assert its supremacy or that Kiihlmanh should be replaced by someone who commanded the confidence of the Higher Command. The second of these courses has apparently been chosen in the appointment of Admiral von Hintze.8. The personal factors in Kiihlmann&apos;s discomfiture do not demand much attention. Like most ambitious and energetic men, he had a number of personal enemies, including an important one belonging to bis own household, Baron von Stumm, of the Foreign Office, cousin of his late wife, who died at Constantinople last year. As the husband of a Stumm, he was a member of the family council which is concerned with the adminis-tration of the great Stumm fortune and ironworks, and friction is understood to have arisen there between him and his wife&apos;s cousin. It is inherently probable that Hertling did not regard him as a safe collaborator or as one who would loyally and punctiliously carry out the views of an. aged chief governed by principles and prejudices entirely alien to the Kiihlmann type of mind. Hertling&apos;s apology for him in the Reichstag, on the 25th June, was certainly even more lukewarm than a similar intervention on a previous occasion on behalf of the Radical Vice-Chancellor, Herr von Payer. Finally, therd was. the proces scandaleux, which arose out of the attacks by the Pan-German Deutsche Zeitung upon Kiihimann&apos;s private walk and conversation when in Bucharest for the Roumanian peace negotiations. The statement in open court by the defendants, that all they cared for was to get, Kuhlmann out of office, and that they would with-draw the imputations upon his private character if he resigned, show to what expedients political adversaries can descend in war-time. The circumstances of this case helped to rally the Left to the support of Kiihhnann in the final crisis, but the accusations were precisely of the kind which would alienate the Court, particularly the entourage of the Empress, and create aversion among the orthodox Conservatives and the Catholic Centre Party. The case may, moreover, have contributed, together with overwork and political anxieties, to wear him down, for it is stated in many quarters that he was not in good physical or mental form when he delivered in the Reichstag the speech that sealed his fate.It is noteworthy that Kiihlmann&apos;s resignation was not tendered in writing, but arose out of his interview with the Kaiser at the Army Headquarters, and was tendered by word of mouth during that interview. Those who are familiar with the Kaisers ways on such occasions may easily imagine the circumstances. According to Hertling&apos;s speech (in Main Committee of Reichstag, 11th July), &quot;it was not material, but personal grounds that caused Kiihlmann to hand in his resignation.&quot; After praising Kuhlmanirs past work, Hertling added : &quot; I had to part with him because there was not the necessary relationship of confidence between him and other factors, a relationship of confidence which is indispensable for the conduct of affairs without friction.&quot;This must refer chiefly to K\ihlmann&apos;s relations with the Higher Command. According to various newspaper accounts, Kuhlmann, when he arrived at General Headquarters, found himself &quot; in the atmosphere of an ice-house and accordingly sent in his resignation.&quot;9. Admiral Paul von Hintze, the new Secretary of State, is in his fifty-fifth year. He was not born noble, but was the son of a bourgeois merchant of the Prussian town ofSchwedt, on the Oder. His naval service included a term as flag officer to the commander of the German cruiser squadron in the Far East. He was with his ship before Manila during the Spanish-American war, and it was he who conveyed the historic message from Admiral Dewey to Admiral Diederichs, when Dewey was about to open lire. In 1903 he was appointed naval attache for the Scandinavian countries with his headquarters at Petrograd. In 1906 the Emperor made him a personal aide-de-camp and conferred hereditary nobility upon him. In 1908 he was appointed Military Plenipotentiary at the Russian Court, and according to the reciprocal custom was attached to the person of the Czar and to military headquarters.
4He acquired, as Hertling has just testified,^ &quot; a good knowledge of Russian conditions and travelled widely in the country.&quot; In 1910 he was removed, owing to differences with the German Ambassador, Count Pourtales. He retired, with the rank of rear-admiral, from active service in the navy early in 1911, and in May of the same year was sent as Minister to Mexico, a post which he retained till after the outbreak of war. In 1915 he was transferred to Peking, and succeeded in reaching his new post after&apos; an adventurous journey in a merchant vessel. He remained there till 1917 and endeavoured to organise the German military espionage service across the Russo-Chinese border and in Japan. On the rupture of Chinese relations with Germany, he returned home with Count Tarnowsky via America and Holland under a safe-conduct. In June&apos; of that year he went as German Minister to Christiania with the primary object of allaying the irritation which had been caused by the importation of explosives in the luggage of the German diplomatic courier and of dealing with the many cora-mercial and maritime questions which continued to arise between Germany and Norway, According to Norwegian and other testimony, he discharged his duties with great adroitness and would have been more successful, had the circumstances of the case permitted.10. An incident on the eve of Kiihlmanns speech is worth noting. The Berlin &quot; Vossische Zeitung&quot; published an article from the pen of Georg Bernhard (one of Hintze&apos;s chief supporters in the press) entitled &quot; Balfour or Peace,&quot; attacking the British Secretary of State as an obstacle to negotiations. This was the beginning of a campaign in that journal against England and America, with the hope of representing them to France and Italy as pursuing selfish aims. The Christiania correspondent of the &quot; Vossische Zeitung,&quot; we are informed, went about telling the Norwegian press that the article was to be regarded as inspired by the German Foreign Office. Was Hintze connected with this manoeuvre behind Kuhlmann&apos;s back, or had he induced Hertling to countenance it ? It will soon be seen whether in the Wilhelmstrasse he will continue to pursue this line of policy. Much will evidently depend on the fate of the German salient on the Marne under the Franco-American assaults, and&apos;upon the general sequel for the German Western offensive.It may be that Hintze will prove himself to be one of the new species of German naval politicians, of whom Tirpitz was the first, and a very formidable one, too, so long as he was still in office. Physical energy, ruse, and bluff are characteristic of this new school, and they have likewise exhibited remarkable skill in their management of the press. The Admiralty Press Bureau in Berlin was always far better managed than that of the Foreign Office. Tirpitz was, moreover, a consummate parliamentary tactician. But it remains to be seen how far Hintze will be able to manage his Pan-German friends or to dissociate himself from them, if events should necessitate the abandonment of the tack on which they have assumed he will sail.* Speech in the Main Committee, July 11. It is said that on the assassination of Count Mirbach at Moscow Hintze was at first taken into consideration as his successor.
