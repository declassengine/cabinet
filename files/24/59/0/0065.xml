The War Priorities Committee were much impressed by the gravity of the situation and its exigencies as represented in person by the Coal Controller, and they were of opinion that * pronounce-ment on the lines suggested by their Permanent Subcommittee regarding the cessation of recruiting from the deal mining industry would tend to inorease output, as it is believed there is a tendency to general unsettlement and irregularity of work so long as a considerable number of men are uncertain whether they will continue to work in this country or be called up to join the Army.    The War Priorities Committee accordingly suggest the promulgation by the War Cabinet of a pronouncement on the following lines, if approved.    It should be noted that Sir Auckland Oeddes and Major-General Sir William Puree on behalf of Lord Milner recorded their dissent from the time-limit definitely specified therein.Kln consequence of the increased supplies of coal which &quot;are essential to maintain the output of munitions and &quot;to meet the necessities of our Allies it has been &quot;decided that recruiting fcom coal mines shall be &quot;suspended until 31st March 1919&quot;*x(Signed)   P.

V/.P.113.SHORTAGE OP COAL SUPPLY, MMORMDUM      PERMANENT STJB-COMMITTSE WAR PRIORITIES COMMITTEE.Jhc Permanent Sub-Committee have had &quot;before thorn at their meeting on July 23rd the following papers:-1918G.T* 4S92, dated June 18th,/by the Minister of Munitions (already circulated as W,P*0?).W.P.112, which is a Report, dated July 19th, 1918,. from the Hihistry of Munitions that, according to the Coal Controller, &quot;there is no coal available for any &quot;new works or extensions to works, and that it is at &quot;the present time impossible to keep existing works &quot;in full operation ,&quot;Tho permanent Sub-Committee elbo received at their meeting a verbal report from tho Steel Production Department Of the Ministry of Munitions to the effect that some twelve or fifteen important steel and iron works arc at the prcsont   &apos; time short of coal, and that in some instances they have had to oloso dovm part of their works,Tho permanent Sub-Coiamitt e o view the present and pros-pectivo situations with, considerable alarm&quot;,   The Prcnch -and Italians aro dependent on Britain for considerable supplies of coal, without which -there would be danger of sorious troubles in those countries,   Further if England; is to remain tho principal v;or.!:shop of the Allies it is imperative that sufficient oor.1 should bo available for the manufacture of every nature of war supplies. . The permanent Sub-Committec also view with apprehension the proposals of tho Cool Controller to make great reductions in supplies of coal to civil industries not directly connected with the War, and also in the supplies of coal for domestic requirements.While agreeing whole-heartedly with the necessity for the utmost economy in coal in both manufacturing and domestic uses the permanent Sub-Committoo desire to record their opinion that the maintenance of a supply adequate for all purposes is of such vital importance that were it to fail, oven in a moderate degree, the result would bo catastrophic.They arc informed that the reasons for the present shortage erefa) recruiting of minors, (bj reduced output per miner.Those causes have been accentuated by the cpidomic of influenza which though only temporary may easily recur.The Committee suggost that the question of maintaining man-power in the raining industry is of equal, if not greater importance to that of maintaining man-powor in munitions and kindred industries, and that the matter is one which should bo considered by the War cabinet as a whole with&apos;the proposals that have already keen made-fay the War priorities Committee in connection with the maintenance of essential man-power in the munitions industries.They
200They further urgo that some reassuring pronouncement should- be made to the effect that there is at present no in-tention to make further calls for the Amy on the mining industry.    The Committee hope that the&quot;output of coal per miner will thereby be improved, as there is a tendency to general unsettlomcnt and irregularity of work ao long as a considerable number of men arc uncertain whether they will oontinue to work in this country or have to join the Army.   Without some such declaration unrest amongst minors will continue to depreciate output.The Coal Controller through his representative who was present at the meeting of tho permanent Sub-Committee undertook to furnish a general statement on the subject for early con-si deration by the War priorities Ce-mmittoe.The Cwnmittoe decided to report to the War priorities Committee in the above sense.\July 23rd, 1918.
