It is believed that one of the divisions which have just arrived is to be used as a third Depot division.In addition there are 12 battalions of coloured troops with tho French and various administrative and lines of communication troops.   The following is a summary of the number of the American forces In, or en route to, Europe at 26th July (excluding sailings since 19th July which have not yet been reported) *-General Pershing&apos;s ArjngFrance     - 23 divisions, AdministrativeUnUs, etc.................... 974,184England   - awaiting shipment ............ 13,715En&quot;route)   England ...................... 43,584to: - )   France    ......................   _64,6701,096,153II With B.E.F.France     - 5 divisions;   Casual, Medical,Engineer and Aviation units 126,854III With French.12 Battalions Coloured troops........... 23,383IV In ItalyAVarious Hospital Units.................. 1,653V In U.

It is expected that the other division will be moving forward from the back area shortly.(b) Divisions with Airier lean Expeditionary Force,.   The training of tne recently arrived ulvisicns&apos; Is&apos;boi.ng pushed on&apos;and another of the divisions which arrived in June has moved from the training area and has gone into reserve in ALSACE.   Two of these June divisions are therefore already being made use of,Shipping.(a)   In addition to the 23 divisions already in Europe, 4 others have sailed or are due to sail from America by the end ofJuly
s si9m\81July,   This means that by August 1st, except for 147,000 Service Supply troops, the first American Army (which according to American organisation consists of 5 Corps of 6 Divisions each) complete with artillery for 30 divisions and all corps avid other troops will be in or en route to Europe, besides the Combatant troops of 2 divisions of the 2nd American Army.(b) For August, the tonnage available is estimated at 290,000 and the proposed shipments are as follows4 Divj.sions Gombatant troops. *.-,,     84,000 Infantry; Artillery, etc.,replacements e,c     50,000 Service Supply troops to complete First Army....................,   147,000281,000The balance of tonnage left will be used to ship the combatant troops of 2 more divisions.To sum up, by August 31st, the v^hole of the First Army complete with Service of the rear, plus the combatant troops of 6 divisions of the Second Army will have left America,(c) whether this rate of transportation of troops will be continued beyond August has not yet been decided, and it seems doubtful whether the programme of 100 divisions by July 1st, 1919, will be realised even supposing that all available tonnage is put at the disposal of the Americans.   The limiting factors are the question of tonnage for the supplies and equipment of so rapidly expanding an Army, and the supply of the necessary artillery material.   The supply of men will not be a difficulty as it is proposed shortly to extend the age limit in America, -(d) To give an instance -of the despatch with-which the conveyance of troops from America to Europe is-conducted, it may be observed that on June 22nd:the &quot;LeviathanV, arrived at Brest with over 10;000 personnel and-1,190 tons, of&apos;material, was unloaded, returned to America and arrived at Brest on-its next voyage by 15th. July with over 10.,500 troops - a period, of only 23 days,I.

1943.Operations .(a) American Divisions-continue &quot;W^tsika-part in the battle on the French front, and during the past week have been engaged between the Marne and Soissons.   In all 8 divisions are now err. this part of the battle front, of whioh 4 have been withdrawn after severe fighting, 2 are still engaged, while 1 which was lightly engaged in the fighting East of Chateau Thierry has been brought up in support of the 6th French Army and the remaining 1 is a division withdrawn from line in Alsace and now behind the front of the 6th French Army.   Ho details of the fighting have yet been received, but it appears probable that some of the Divisions engaged were retained too long in battle with the result that they will take some time to recuperate. .6 American divisions are now on the French cjuiet front, 5 in the line and 1 in reserve.It is proposed at once to form 2 American Armies, each consisting of 6 divisions and to give each a sector of the front.   The sector of the First Army (which is already in process of formation) will be between the Marne and the Ourcq, and will, it is understood, be temporarily commanded by General Pershing.   The Commander of the Second Army is not yet known and the sector to be held by this Army will be about Pont A Mousson (North of Nancy) and will be regarded as a rest zone for Divisions from the battle front,(b) Accurate returns of the total American casualties to date are not available, but so far as these have been reported up to 17th July the total losses (including died of disease,, but not including slightly wounded) were 17,561,   From information obtained direct from three divisions concerned casualties amounting to about 7,000 each were incurred during from 4 to 7 days &apos; fighting in the Chateau Thierry salient, one division having a very large proportion of senior officers knocked out.General Staff,: ^ar Office,. 30,7,18,
