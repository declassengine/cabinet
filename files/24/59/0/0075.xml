PJSBQIillS.It is now a little over a year since I was asked to deal with all questions connected with Petroleum Oil and the War Cabinet may like to have a brief statement of the progress which has been made during that interval.For practically the whole of our petroleum require-ments we are dependent upon importation from oversea, and as the Cabinet are aware the question of supply has from time to time given cause for very great anxiety,,   The following comparative figures of stocks and consumption will illustrate the progress that has been made:-Consumption      Stocks in PJ^rjsonth fcafli,June 1917 395,000 920,000 tonsJune 1918 476,500        1,531,000   &quot;With a view to the successful performance of myduties and to secure co-ordination between the variousdepartments interested in Petroleum, I instituted thePetroleum Executive with Professor Sir John Cadman asDirector which, by maintaining close personal touch withother Departments has been able to ensure more prompt andeffective action and to prevent overlapping.   It also actsas the Petroleum Programme Committee for the Inter-AlliedMaritime Transport Council,I was able to obtain the consent of the Ministerof Munitions to send Sir Frederick Black last summer toUnited States where I had found that a special oilrepresentative was essential owing to our dependence onthat country for supplies and for assistance with tonnage.
9 906 SJ) 4JAs the difficulties of supply affect the Allies as a whole and as the most economical use of all tank bowmg$ could only be attained by constant communication I pressed for the appointment of an Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference which was formed some months ago with representatives of Great Britain, the United States, France and Italy and which meets regularly in London and Paris and has been attended by excellent results. A continuous check is kept on the stocks and supply programme of each country and after extended negotiations a scheme for re-routing tank vessels whioh involved important readjustments of trade and a substantial saving in tonnage has been practically completed.    The petroleum Executive acts as the permanent secretariat of the Conference and is in almost daily conference with the representatives or liaison officers of the Allies.As regards our own position, stocks have considerably increased though I regret to say they are still below what 1 regard as a safe level. When it is stated that British require-ments of petroleum products at present total approximately 6,500,000 tons per annum the difficulties of supply will be appreciated.In addition to the needs of Western Kurops which arc-largely met from the United states the situation asregards consumption and production throughout the world has to be kept constantly under review.  Questions are continually arising as to supplies for India, China, Egypt and other countries, while the maintenance of output in the different oilfields has also to be watched.  As practically the whole of the tank tonnage now in commission is British or American owned we are able, in association with the United States, to regulate the whole-oil trade of the world.At
At home, the production of oil by the distillation of shale and coal is being carried on under considerable difficulties owing to shortage of labour and material, but over 600,000 tons per annum is being obtained from these sources.  Preparations are almost complete for boring for liquid petroleum on an exbeneifee scale.The unessential use of petrol has been practically stopped.   Before the introduction of the Motor Spirit Restrictions in August 1916 the consumption for civil pur-poses was estimated at 41,000 tons (12,300,000 galls) per month, while the present civil consumption is approximately 20,000 tons (6,000,000 gulls) per months   It will be seen therefore that the saving amounts to some 6,000,000 gallons per month, a quantity which is almost capable of supplying the needs of the British Army in France for motor transport work.The purchase and import of oil for all purposes has been undertaken by His Majesty1s Government and over-lapping in distribution has been eliminated through the Pool Board, nearly 1500 men being set free for military service in 1917 alone0In view of our present dependence on foreign petroleum supplies I have thought it necessary to appoint a Committee which is now sitting, with Lord Harcourt as Chairman, to examine the whole question and to make recommendations as to ous future policy,Colonial Office, 31st July, 1918,W.H.L.
