G.T. 5249

OFFER OF EATON HALL TO THE NATION FOR A ROYAL AERONAUTICAL COLLEGE BY THE DUKE OF WESTMINSTER, G.C.N.O., D.S.O.

Copy of letter, dated 19th July, 1918. From the Secretary of State for Air, to the Prime Minister.

Air Ministry Strand,

W.C. 2

19th July, 1918.



Dear Prime Minister,

The Air Council have recently had before them for final decision the question of the very patriotic offer which the Duke of Westminister has made through you to present Eaton Hall to the Nation for the purpose of a Royal Aeronautical College.

I need hardly say that the Council have approached the matter with a very sincere desire to take advantage of so generous a proposal and have investigated it from every point of view.

After very careful consideration of all the circumstances, assisted by a personal inspection of the property by representatives of the Council and of the Department of Works and Buildings, the Council has, with  great reluctance, come to the conclusion that the acceptance of the offer cannot be justified. The reasons which have led to this conclusion are the considerable cost of the conversion of the mansion to the purpose of a College, the heavy charge of maintenance which will necessarily be involved, the unsuitability of its geographical position and the difficulty of finding at a reasonable expense adequate aerodrome accommodation.

The Air Council at the same time desire me to express to you their great appreciation of the generosity and public spirit she n by the Duke in making this offer, and their regret that for the reasons which I have given, they are not able to avail themselves of it.



Yours sincerely,

(signed) ?IR

The Rt. Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.P.

Downing Street,

Whitehall,
