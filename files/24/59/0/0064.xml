S B C 11 K T.(This Document is the Property of . f. ;jHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government &apos; *&quot;WAR CABINET.RtTPPjLY Off SOIJCTLLPOtnt m.J^J&amp;fcSBS -Memorandum,by the Secretary for^lojtla^t.(l).   The situation with regard to supplementary labour for the harvest in Scotland Is extremely grave*    When the release *for military service of a quota of 5,500 agricultural workers ^ajt^ttled it was understood on all hands that additional/labour for the harvest would be necessary and &quot;would be provided.    Last year some thousands of soldiers were 00 employed.    This year, owing to the great increase in cropping and the withdrawal of the quota, 1 am advised that 10,000 soldiers will be required.     15,000 applications have already been sent in by farmers.   Bourses of supply othsr than military sources, eannot be counted upon to fill more than 5*000 places. The 10,000 men referred to will be wanted for the period from August to October*(2),   In- reply to my request for this number of men the War Office have just informed ay department that it will not be possible to supply soldiers except convalescents for the corn harvest in Scotland (or in England and Wales) as every avail-able man is being got ready for service in Prance.(35*   This, intimation creates an exceedingly difficult situation.    I fully appreciate the needs of the Army,   At the same time it must he remembered that farmers have put under crop a greatly increased acreage at the express request of thr Government.    They have done 00 in the full expectation that they would be left or provided with the labour necessary to secure the harvest.    Their plane have been seriously upset by the taking of the quota.   To meet tho consequent depletion they have relied more than ever upon the provision of soldiers at harvest time.   The Board of Agriculture for Scotland were undets the impression that this provision would be made, until a week age when doubts were raised by the Ministry Of National Service. X should be surprised if the officials of the Ministry in Scotland had not proceeded upon the same fcestqfcption.U).   Every opportunity will be taken of utilising other forms of labour such as women, school boys, prisoners of war, and agricultural volunteers,   X apprehend, however, that the supplies from these sources will fall far short of the require-ments.   I submit that the question of removing to France all the low grade soldiers who would otherwise be available for tins harvest merits full consideration.    Admitting the needs of the Amy3 it appears to me to be a matter for consideration whether the risks on the other side are not as great,   Failing addition al soldier labour, the prospeote are that a large proportion of the harvest will be lost;   that the agricultural community will regard the Government in breach of its undertakings   and responsible for the losses incurred;   and that it will be impossible again to induce farmers to embark on a programme -of increased food production.(5)*   If no soldier labour, other than convalescents, is to be available, farmers should know the worst at the earliest possible momast. .1 trust, however, that means may be found for modifying the policy &quot;which would deprive them of the expected and necessary assistance.ROBERT MKRO.Scottish Office, 2nd July, 1918.
