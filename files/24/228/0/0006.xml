(THIS pDCUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAIN IC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEjIKMSITT) :EiU Copy No.       ^CA3IBST.HOME    //HEAT   QJJ OTA    SCHEME, 1932,Memorandum by the, Minister of Agriculture andFiAh9rA9JU.1. The Cabinet on 27th January (Cab. 9 (32) Conclusion 6),in approving the Home i-Jheat Quota Plan, asked me to report upon a suggestion that the Bill should contain a provision for appropriate reconsideration and alteration by executive decision of the basic price from time to time.     It was suggested that the first enquiry should take place at the end of three years.2, The arguments in favour of this proposal are that,particularly in view of the present financial uncertainty, it is impossible to foresee the future course not only of wheat but also of commodity prices generally.     For this reason, no safe assumptions can be made in regard to the main variable item of production-costs, i.e. , wages of farm labour, or of the costs of other items, such as artificial manures.     A provision for revising the basic price, if necessary, would therefore be a safeguard to the consumer, in the event of a general cheapening of production costs, and to the farmer, in the event of a general enhancement of production-costs. 3. we have already decided not to encourage theextension of the growing of wheat to unsuitable land, and the Quota Plan has been designed with this policy in view. If the price fixed proves to be favourable the acreage under wheat will expand.     .vhen the supply of wheat exceeds the 6 million quarters proposed to be Inserted in the Bill the price accruing to the grower will be automatically reduced and it may be anticipated that production would be adjusted accordingly.
4. Nevertheless, I Incline to the view that itwould he an advantage for provision to be made in the Bill for a review of the situation after an interval of years, and if my colleagues agree, I propose to provide In the Bill for an enquiry to take place 3 years hence into the suitability of the basic price, having regard to the agricultural and general economic conditions then prevailing.(INTLD .)
