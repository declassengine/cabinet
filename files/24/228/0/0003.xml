CABINET.ret. Copy No.  7ELECTRICITY V/AYLEAVES,Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.I desire to bring to the notice of the Cabinet the situation which has been created by the recent decision of Mr. Justice Macnaghten in the case of the West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority and the Minister of Transport -v- Pitt and Others, with regard to the extent of my jurisdiction under Section 22 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919, which empowers me to grant compulsory wayleaves to electricity undertakers for the purpose of placing electric lines above or below ground across private land.      Under these provisions the Minister of Transport is empowered to give his consent &quot;either unconditionally or subject to such terms,  conditions, and stipulations as he thinks just&quot;, but the effect of the decision referred to is that the practice which has been adopted during the twelve years which have elapsed since the passage of the Act of inserting in the Minister&apos;s consents conditions covering such things as wayleave rentals, annual sums in respect of compensation for interference with agriculture, depreciation of the value of the land if subsequently required for building,  is ultra vires, and that any disputed questions relating to pecuniary terms of any kind must be settled subsequently by arbitration either under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, v/here the undertaker is a public authority, or under  sections 1J and 28 of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, in other cases.The intention of parliament when enacting Section 22 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919, seems clearly to have been that the power granted to the Minister to award compulsory wayleaves should be a complete self-contained procedure.      This intention would be defeated if Mr. Justice Macnaghten&apos;s Judgment were to stand, and upon the advice of the Law Officers I have appealed against the decision with a view to obtaining an
G- 2 -authoritative interpretation of the existing law at the earliest possible date.      Such a decision cannot, however, &quot;be obtained for some time, and it is necessary to determine in what form consents shall be issued meanwhile.      To eliminate from the consents all references to the important question of pecuniary terms would create, both for electricity undertakers and landowners, a condition of embarrassment and uncertainty, and would almost inevitably give rise to further litigation.      To issue the consents with an indication that the Minister would, if possible, settle the pecuniary terms subsequently,  is a course which I am advised by the Law Officers it is not open to me to take.      In the circumstances I have decided to proceed in accordance with the advice which the Lav/ Officers have given, and to continue to issue compulsory wayleave consents as heretofore, but to enclose with such consents a letter referring to the Judgment and to the fact that it is subject to appeal, and adding that it is to be understood that the consent in no way deprives the owner of the land concerned of any right which he may have to seek compensation aliunde.I am anxious to give no ground for any criticism being made to the effect that a Minister of the Crown is treating the Courts with disrespect, and I am advised that this action will not be open to any such criticism.I desire to add that should Mr. Justice Macnaghten&apos;s Judgment eventually be upheld, a situation might arise which would require the consideration of the Cabinet as a matter of policy.26th January, 1952,(Sgd. ) P4 J. PYBUS.
