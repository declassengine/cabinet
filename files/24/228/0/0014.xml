this document is the property of his britannic majestvs government cabinet,NAVAL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME 1.951.Kamorandom by the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty.I should like to add the following postscript to my Memorandum CCP. 47 (32), in which I reported that my discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer had failed to reveal any means of preventing the postponement of the orders for the 1931 Naval Construction Programme   until October 193201. In my concluding sentence, pointing out the resultof this postponement on the shipbuilding and engineering centress I feel that I ought to have made special reference to the effect upon Woolwich.      The late ordering of the ships in question carries with It the late ord.eri.ng of their guns? and consequently the Naval work which Woolwioh would other-wise have had in the gun shops of the Ordnance Factory will be reduced ty about  10,000 to  15j000 in 1932. 2o The.second, and much more Important matter to whichI feel it my duty to draw attention is this.      Since I have been at the Admiralty I have noted with increasing alarm the evidence which I find in all directions of the Navy&apos;s serious deficiency in almost every kind of material required tc enable it to carry out its duties in any sort of emergency. This is the result of the Defence Services having been rigidly subjected for ten years past to the principle of &quot;No great war for ten years&quot;? - interpreted not in the sense that the provision of requirements for an emergency shouldTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.1st secret,,?, 64 (52).1Unwind&apos;&quot;&apos;:&quot;&apos;        &apos;     -MHHmaMMMMHawMBmwrve^-
be spread over a period of ten years, but in the sense that the provision need hardly be begun until the time comes when the principle is falsified by events.The inevitable result of this policy ia to be seen in the Par East at the present moment, where it would be absolutely impossible for us to retain our hold on Hong Kong if,  as a result of present events, our position there should be challenged, while Singapore and Trincomali could be reduced and the Naval supplies, fuel and facilities there destroyed before our Fleet could reach them., thus not only barring its further progress to the East, but probably necessitating its withdrawal so far to the Westward as to leave India uncovered,I feel that it is necessary that the Cabinet should know that this is the present position, and that on the basis of the expenditure to which I have been limited in preparing Navy Estimates for 1938 - and I believe the same is true of the other Defence Departments - no improvement in the position will be possible in the next twelve months,  ;:oad I wish the Cabinet to realise that the responsibility for this fact will be theirs.(Intldo)    B0EoM.Admiralty,5th February, 1932s,
