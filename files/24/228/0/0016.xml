SECRET. C.P.66(32)Copy No.cabinet. INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION LIMITING HOURS OF WORKIN COAL MINES.Supplementary Note by the President of the Board of Trade.With reference to my memorandum CP. 51 (32), I now circulate a further memorandum by the Secretary for Mines, drawn up after discussion with the Minister of Labour.W.R.Board of Trade,8th February, 1932THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.
Since the Memorandum CP. 51 (32) was circulated to the Cabinet there has bean further discussion with the Ministry of Labour regarding the announcement to be made If the Cabinet should decide not to reject the Convention.   As a result of this discussion the second alternative on Page 5 of the Memorandum should now read as follows that His Majesty&apos;s Government Is favourably disposed towards the Convention.   The detailed application of some of Its provisions to the coal mines of this country presents certain problems which are under consideration at the present time but which it is anticipated will not prove insuperable.   As soon as these points have been disposed of, the Government will be prepared to ratify the Convention provided that the other six countries principally concerned will do so at the same time.If the Cabinet decide to authorise the issue of an announcement on these general lines, the exact wording would be agreed subsequently between the Ministry of Labour and the Mines Department.(Signed)    Isaac Foot.
