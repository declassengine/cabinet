(THIS DOCDIvDSNT 13 TH3 PROPERTY 02? HIS SEITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;3GOVEPJ^vLEKT).SECRETCP.  77 ( 32)COPY EOCABINET.india appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 16th February 1932.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated 16th February 1932,  issued on the authority of the Secretary pf State for India.In the last appreciation it was stated that in their fight against the civil disobedience movement Government had started with certain advantages hut that there were unstable fprces which forbade any clear appreciation of the future course of events.      This was written a month ago and the intervening&apos; period has been one of very satisfactory achievement,  tempered by various potential dangers which, although still latent, have not developed so seriously as was at the time apprehended.      So far as civil disobedience alone is concerned,   the position is distinctly good.    There was some recovery by Congress from the first blow, and during the latter half of January there was a definite increase in agitation In several provinces there is as yet no clear evidence that it has reached its height.    Generally, however, there are grounds for hope that recovery will not be so strong or so sustained as was generally expected.      In several provinces agitation is already distinctly on the downward grade. A notable instance is that of theUnited Provinces where improvement has been progressive during the past three weeks.      Bengal also reports a decline of interest.      Conditions in the Central Provinces are better.        The situation in Bombay Presidency is very satisfactory, with the exception of Bombay City, where, however,  there have been recent signs of improvement. Little is happening in Madras.       The movement in the Punjab is very   weak and in Bihar and Orissa most pf the districtsreport
222report easier conditions.In several respects improvement has &quot;been most marked in North West Frontier Province,    but there the elements of instability are greater than in other provinces and suggest caution in taking too sanguine a view.     Even so, he would have been a bold prophet who would have predicted that within a few weeks of attacking the Red Shirt movement it would have been possible, as it has been,  to release hundreds of prisoners, to collect large arrears of Land Revenue,  to remove in two districts restrictions on meetings which had been in force for some months, and to approach elsewhere to the restoration of normal conditions.      On the other hand,  he would be a sanguine prophet who would predict that the people of the province will now settle down quietly to the introduction of a new constitution which it is hoped to bring into force in April next.        The Red Shirt movement was too deeply rooted to expect that there will be no reactions against the strong measures which have been taken,  even if it were possible to isolate the province, which is impracticable.The three main features of the civil disobedience campaign up to date are the following:(1)    the silent boycott of British goods arid institutions;(2)    picketing;(3)    observance of particular days.As regards the first,  the general impression is that considerable success has been attained in the boycott ofBritish goods,  but little success in the boycott of institutions.Sentiment is the main force and,  although socialboycott is also operative,  intimidation is,  so far, less inevidence than in 1930,  and secret persuasion more widely prac-used.     Many who are not in sympathy with other items of thecivil
9 9 9w w J civil  disobedience programme subscribe to boycotting.    Peeling in this respect is more intense in Bombay City than elsewhere, but affects certain classes of the population throughout the country.      The effect will decrease as economic forces come into play and as the civil disobedience movement declines,  trtt to some extent results will be permanent.Picketing is the most common form of open activity.      It is at present confined to the cities and is mostly concerned with cloth shaps.      There have been few reports of picketing of liquor shops.        Picketing accounts for great majority of arrests.      It has,  on the whole,  been free from violence.The observance of particular days is designed to excite and Sustain public interest,  to provoke clashes with the police and so arouse feeling against the Government.    The more important observances during the month   were,Independence Day, Prontier Day, and Gandhi Day.      Generally speaking they failed, attendances were small, excitement little and clashes few.    The contrast between their success in 1930 and their comparative failure now,  is very marked.Casual activities include very half-hearted attempts to defy the Salt laws in Bombay,  a few isolated instances of breaches of the forest Laws and local encouragement for non-payment of rent and revenue.The present campaign is thus of a restricted character. There is no comprehensive programme and little organisation on an all-India basis.    The initial action taken against all leaders has undoubtedly disorganised the programme.    It is particularly noticeable that agitation in rural areas has made little,  if any, apparent progress and in the United Provinces the no-rent campaign has practically disappeared.       Gujerat, which was a storm centre in 1930,  is giving practically notrouble
224trouble,  in fact revenue collections there are better than they have been for some years. In no province have therebeen resignations of Government officials and social boycott of Government servants is apparently negligible.    Students have not joined the movement in any number   and,  so far there has been no attempt to; boycott educational institutions.    It is, however,  necessary to remember that as regards both rural areas and students,   seasonal advantages are on the side of the Government.        The agricultural population are busy in their fields,  and their attitude will not become clear until about March or April, unless, however,   Congress have been able to do more underground work than is apparent at present.    They will find  it difficult with their weakened organisation to stir up more than- local trouble.      As regards students, many of them are now working for examinations and they v/ill not be free for political activity until about May.     Experience in the past has shown that April, May and June are the months most favourable to mass movement,  but here again it may be hoped that the control which the Government have obtained will prevent movement obtaining any substantial momentum during those months.Accurate - figures of convictions are not yet available, but up to the end of January they numbered about 12,500.      In addition, approximately 2,650 arrests have taken place under Section 3 of the Ordinance.      On the other hand,  there has been a considerable number, of releases on apology or otherwise.  On a rough calculation the number in jail at present may be put at about 15,000.        These figures are large and they may appear inconsistent&apos; with the above appreciation of the movement.    It has to be remembered, however,  that the policy followed on the present occasion has been different from that followed in 1930.Then
225Then initial action was on a comparatively small scale and the movement had gained very considerable momentum before action was taken against the rank and file or even against some of the leaders.      It then became necessary on a big scale which had to be maintained for several months.      It was not,  in fact,  until the end of five or six months that the jails population began to decline, and even then progress was slow. If situation oontinues to improve,  one may expect that on the present occasion the peak will be reached much earlier than in 1930,  and that the decline will be more rapid.In &apos;the meantime, advance has been made with constitutional reforms.    The Consultative Committee held its first meeting during the month and meets again on the 22nd, when it will sit continuously for several weeks.      The Franchise Committee has got to work, and evidence.ence is being produced before it by all parties and interests except Congress.      The announcement that it hopes to complete the major portion of its task before the completion of the present year has had a good effect,  and the press generally is giving publicity to its proceedings.    So far,  there has been no open demonstration of hostility towards any of the Committees.      Good progress has been made towards the introduction of dyarchy into the ITorth West   Frontier Province.If everything goes well it is anticipated that the elections will be held at the beginning of April and that the province will have a Legislative Council in by the middle of the same month.      Considerable importaric^aTtaches to this,  not only from Muslim, but also from general point of view,  since it will represent the first fruition of under-takings contained in the declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government,        The sooner tangible results can be presented
226presented, to the public,  the easier will be the task of the Government in dealing with subversive movement,  for behind a good deal of sympathy with Congress is the suspicion, which it is hard to dissipate,   that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not mean business with reforms.    Once the people are convinced that there will be no delay in impleiffinting promises,   the futility of unconstitutional methods will be more widely recognised and civillliisobedience deprived of much of the moral support it now receives.      The desire for results is manifesting itself in an increasing demand for early provincial autonomy and provided that there is no avoidable delay in proceeding with fe-deral responsibility at the centre,  it will not be surprising if public opinion reverses the views expressed on this matter by the delegates at the Round Table Conference.It Is all to the good that, unlike 1930 when constitutional solutions were very much in the air,  they have now reached a stage in which details of approved scheme are being worked out.
