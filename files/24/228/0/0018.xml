[This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.    February 1932.Copy No../.....CABINET.Reports by Local Governments on the Political Situation in India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly reports from the Local Governments in India.S. H.India Office, 9th February 1932.Government of India.The Delhi report indicates little change. The reports generally are very satis-factory, having special regard, firstly, to the expectation that the movement would intensify, and secondly, to the complication introduced by the observance of Frontier Day on 5th February.   The following are reassuring features : (a) In the five settled districts of the North-West Frontier Province, the improvement has been maintained. Tangible evidence of this is afforded by the withdrawal from two districts of restrictive orders which had been in force for some time, and by the complete absence of demonstrations on Frontier Day, and by the release of prisoners. Indications of trouble in tribal areas are also less definite, but the trouble in Dir has not yet cleared up, and the situation among some tribes is still unstable.(o) Improvement, in the United Provinces has been maintained, and this week&apos;s report, taken with last week&apos;s. suggests that agitation is now definitely on the downward scale.(c) The Bombay report is particularly gratifying, since it indicates that there has been no deterioration in Bombay city and that there has been a definite decline in activities in almost all districts.(d) The reports of other Provinces give no cause for anxiety. The increase of agitation in the Punjab was to be expected, but is still on a scale far below that of most other Piwinces. Everywhere the situation is well in hand, and there are no clear signs from anywhere of the movement gaining such momentum as might have been reasonably anticipated at this stage. On the contrary, there-are indications from several Provinces that the peak may be reached sooner than was expected.2. Observances of Frontier Day on 5th February passed off without incident anywhere. They were distinct from the civil disobedience movemeut, and were not generally associated with Congress.3. Kashmir continues to give cause for anxiety. The situation in Jamniu Province has definitely improved, but reports just received indicate the possibility of trouble extending to Kashmir Province. Events have inevitably roused considerable feeling.4. The general policy of Government was debated during the week in the Assembly on a resolution so drafted as to secure the maximum measure of support from all parties and communities. The resolution was regarded by the Government as a vote of censure, and was directly opposed. It was defeated by 62 votes to 44, and the Legislature has thus, at a very critical juncture, supported the measures which the Government have been forced to take.Bombay.The situation continues quiet in the Mofussil and reports from almost all the districts indicate a definite decline in civil disobedience activities. There are no new developments  anywhere.   Two youths responsible for telegraph wire cutting in6SC      CO   2,32SECRET.CP. 68 (32).
Belgaum were convicted and heavily sentenced. There Lave been no fresh cases, but faint-hearted attempts at forest satyagraha and toddy tree cutting continue. Land revenue collections are satisfactory.In Bombay city, picketing continued at cloth shops and at the mint. The. number of picketers showed a tendency to fall, and there were 29 arrests for picketing. Hartals continued in most markets and bazaars. In response to pressure from Government, the Stockbrokers&apos; Association, at a general meeting, decided on ths 3rd February to keep the Stock Exchange open for the rest of the week and business was brisk on the reopening. Crowds of hooligans in Bombay city on the evening of the 31st attempted to light bonfires in the streets, and stoned the police and fire brigade officers. Four rounds were fired by the police officers in self-defence. Again, on the 1st, attempts were made by hooligans to damage or burn two police chowhis. A pn public warning was published by Government on the 3rd that violent crowds refusing to -disperse would be fired on. Since then there has been no further hooliganism in the city. Gandhi Day demonstrations on the 4th were stopped without trouble. The Peshawar Day meeting of Mussalmans on the 5th passed off peacefully.Following is the action taken under the Ordinances : 88 arrests during the week under section 3, Emergency Powers Ordinance ; 58 arrests for breach of orders under section 4.Madras.The situation is quiet and is free from serious incident. In many districts all outward manifestations of civil disobedience have disappeared, and in the remainder activities are mainly confined to sporadic picketing and the distribution of seditious literature. False and exaggerated accounts of executive action coutinue to be published by certain papers as a form of propaganda in favour of the civil -disobedience party. Security has so far been demanded from four newspapers and four presses. Five more associations have been declared unlawful, making a total of 106.Bengal.Chittagong and Dacca divisional reports have not been received, but the situation has probably not deteriorated there and is improving slightly or stationary elsewhere. Processions have been generally unimportant, but picketing continues in certain districts. In North Calcutta, on the 29th January, most of the Hindu shops closed for Peshawar Day, but otherwise the week has been quieter, and the number of meetings was 8 as against 11. Picketing has been insignificant, and picketers are generally students or hired workless youths, large numbers of whom are always available and accoxmt for many arrests. Arrests vmder section 3 number 75 ; total detained, 191. Under section 4 the orders issued number 266, and the total number of orders in force is .1,453.United Provinces.The week has been quiet generally with further improvement in the situation. A few .small processions have been taken out and dispersed. Open picketing is now rare and ineffective, Allahabad, both city and district, is still the most severely affected area. Embers are smouldering in Fatehpur and Farrukhabad. No case is reported involving the use of firearms and very few cases in which any force had to be used to disperse processions. A bomb explosion on 1st February in Lucknow is the only striking incident, but this is a purely revolutionary crime. There is some further improvement in the collection of rent and revenue. Two more arrests under section 3, Emergency Powers Ordinance, bring the total to date up to .10. The number of orders made under section 4 of the same Ordinance was 7S during the, week, and totals 266 up to date. Convictions during the week are 465 under Ordinances, 851 under ordinary law. Total to date, 3,609. Eeleased on probation or apology, 577. The large increase during the week is due to magistrates disposing of persons previously arrested. There have been no meetings or processions of Muslims at Lucknow or Alvida, and no trouble at Cawupore.Central Provinces.Except for some increased aggressiveness in Chhattisgarh, the situation has not developed materially.
In Nagpur, moderate leaders held an ill-advised demonstration, which did not,&apos;- ; however, prevent the Independence and Peshawar Day celebrations from being almost a fiasco. . . V.In Jubbulpore itself the situation is quiet. * 1In Berar, the arrest of Aney and other leaders evoked less excitement than was expected.During the week the Instigation Ordinance was extended] to two districts and the Molestation Ordinance to three. One association was declared unlawful and eleven persons or firms in Jubbulpore and Nagpur were restricted from disposing of Congress funds.Prosecutions during week number 171, convictions 131;  fines imposed 6,000 ; recoveries .1,000.Punjab.Though the Province has remained quiet and there have been no clashes with the police, no big meetings and no dispersals by force, the situation shows no real improvement. An increased number of districts report activities, though in no district has there been any successful anti-Government demonstration. There are also indications that trade in British piece-goods is declining as a result of quiet canvassing which is now being adopted in preference to open picketing. There is a tendency for racial ill-feeling to increase and for foreign goods to obtain preference over British. The Kashmir disturbances have already increased and are likely still further to exaggerate communal tension. This will make it more difficult for Congress to attract to its ranks Muslim and Sikh volunteer organisations, as it was hoping to do last week. Arrests during the week for political activities : under ordinary law 14 and under Ordinances 125 ; total \rp to date, 130 and 265, respectively. Arrests during -week under section 3, Emergency Ordinance, 3, all of whom are terrorists; total to date, 3. Orders under section 4 during week, nil; total to date, 27. Total under restraint for infraction of such orders, 2.Bihar and Orissa.There have been no new developments and no intensification of the movement, The only serious incident was an attack on the police on Peshawar Day, 29th January, at Barbicha, Monghyr district, which resulted in the death of one dafadar. Mahommedans abstained from any participation in Peshawar Day, and no reports were received of any demonstrations on the 5th February. Convictions up to 1st February, 2,000.North-&quot;V7est Frontier Province.It has been a very quiet week in all administered frontier districts, due partly to the Ramzan. Efforts are being made in some quarters to revive the agitation after the Id, but present indications are that they will have little success. There were no Frontier Day demonstrations yesterday. Discipline in Haripur Jail is now good and unimportant Congress prisoners are being released. All restrictions under section 144, Criminal Procedure Code, are being withdrawn in the Hazara and Kohat districts.In the trans-frontier area the bombiug of the rebel Dir tribes was postponed as the jirga came in and is now at Chakdara. The jirga is not representative, but the Nawab of Dir still hopes to settle the rebellion without air action by the Government. It is doubtful if he can do so. Some trouble is anticipated from the minor Bajaur tribes alter the Id. Other trans-frontier tribes are quiet and the Mahsud situation is better.   There have been three arrests under section 3 during the week.Burma.Satisfactory progress continues. Two important leaders have been accounted for in the Prome district; one shot by armed villagers and one surrendered. Two casualties are reported among Government forces, two irregular police being wounded. Ninety-three under-trials were released and the number remaining in custody is 426. The price of paddy remained steady about 90. Collection of taxes continues -satisfactory.
Ajmer Merwara. &apos;,Twelve persons were arrested in Ajmer Merwara in the past week under section 17,. Criminal Law Amendment Act. All these persons came from places ontside the-district. There was no active trouble in Ajmer. The movement is distinctly waning in Beawar, and all is quiet in Kekri. Action has been taken against persons secretly encouraging the movement in Beawar. Some Istimrarclars report an organised movement among their tenants to refuse payment of dues. The matter is being investigated.From the Resident in Mysore.In Bangalore convictions up to date number 9-1, and there have been only four arrests during the week. Four persons were released on making a full apology. Petitions of seven others are under consideration. The situation is very satisfactory. In Coorg the situation is still very satisfactory; there have been 61 arrests and 45 convictions to date. Emergency Powers Ordinance not extended to Bangalore or Coorg.
