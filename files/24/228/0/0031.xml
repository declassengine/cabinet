-ASECRET.C.Pa  81  (52). COPY NOC A b in E T.THE MALTA ROYAL COMMISSION,Recoac^endati ons as to Policy to be Adopted *Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.In pursuance of the Cabinet?s decision on the 17th February, I have discussed the Report of the Malta Royal Commission with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,  and we find ourselves in complete agreement as to the action which should now be taken.,We consider it to be desirable that the announcement of the Governments decision should cover all the matters on which the Royal Commission has made recommendationsOur general advice to the Cabinet is that all the recommendations of the Commission, -with the exception of those relating to language and the police, should be accepted as they stand.      The passage from the Report summarising the recommendations is appended to CP.  74 (32)0The Language Question. The Royal Commission recommend an extension of the use of English and Maltese in the Criminal Courts.TrnS&apos;&quot;D0CDMSl7T IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BEITA^WlC iJjj]ST.,&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )
The majority of the Commission express the opinion that on merits the case is fully established for making English the only extra language to &quot;be taught in the Elementary Schools in addition to the native Maltese. Although they advance conclusive arguments for the change,  they suggest that in the circumstances it may be advisable to make the acceptance of this recom-mendation contingent upon a clearer expression of local opinion in favour of it0Both the Foreign Secretary and I have reached the conclusion that the right course is to bring into force forthwith not only the change proposed in the Criminal. Courts, but also that proposed in the curri-culum of the Elementary Schools.      Both these changes lie within the power of the Imperial Government, and can be enacted by Letters Patent.We feel that the proposal with regard to the language in the Elementary Schools is not only clearly justified on its merits, but is also politically desirable.      The Governor supports this view, and is satisfied that if it were possible to take a local re-ferendum on the matter there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of the change.Under the present system whic&quot;   was introduced in 1923, English and Italian have to be taught on an equal footing from Standard III upwards through the medium of Maltese,  the vernacular language.      If an hour of instruction is devoted to English, an hour
has to be devoted to Italian *      The result is that neither English nor Italian are properly learned. The system restricts the number of children who ; can go to school and increases the difficulty of obtaining an adequate staff.    It presents the children from learning to read or write Maltese j their native language.     It is expensive, and it is contrary to the considered advice given by the Committee of the Imperial Education Conference of 1923, which reported that bilingual teaching within the British Empire necessarily implies the acquisition of a competent knowledge of English, and that the learning of a third language is not as a rule desirable before the pupil enters the secondary school stage.Prom the standpoint of general educational policy within the Empire the change is thoroughly justifiable.     Apart from that,- the obvious interests of the children themselves would alone justify it. English is the most useful language in the Island for entry into the Civil Service,- the Police and for securing employment in the Dockyard and on merchant ..ships.     A knowledge of English is also most desirable for emigrants to other parts of the Empire and to the United States.     Before 1923, when the extra language to be taught to the children was left to the choice of the parents, more than 90 per cent are said to have chosen English.
On merits,  the case for the change is clearly a strong one.      On political grounds,  the Foreign Secretary and I consider it desirable that it should be made at once for the following reasons:(1)   It will prevent the question from becoming a contentious party issue at the next Maltese election;(2)  It is probable that if the Nationalists were returned at the next election, they would oppose the measure even though it were clearly in the interests of the people as a whole;(3) We feel that unless the language proposal is adopted concurrently with the other recommendations, it will be held  (with reason)  that the report hardly holds the scales fairly between the contending parties.&quot; &quot;e do not overlook the fact that the adoption .of this proposal as regards language will provoke opposition.      It will certainly be resented by the professional classes such as the lawyers, who object to any extension of English, and by some politicians on the Nationalist side, who have made the language question a matter of party dogma.      We consider, however, that if the change is to be made,  it is preferable that it should be made as part of the general decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the main issues and at a time when the Constitution is about to be restored.
The Police.The Commissioners consider that the administration of the police has been too much influenced by political considerations.   They do not, hoover, recommend that any change should be made at present, though they suggest that the Governor should watch carefully the -working of the system, and, if it continues to work unsatis-factorily, make recommendations to the Imperial Government regarding its amendment0   The Governor takes the view that it is of great importance that the police should cease to be subject^ to undue influence, and suggests that without waiting further all questions relating to the appointments, dismissals and emoluments of the Commissioned Officers of the Force should be taken out of the province of the local Ministry and made a &quot;reserved matter&quot;.The Foreign Secretary agrees with me that this subject does not raise any general external considerations $ and that it should be decided by me upon its merits.   Before considering the matter further, I am awaiting the receipt of the Governor^ detailed views, and when I have received them, I should propose to take a decision without troubling the Cabinet.
I would,  therefore, ask for the authority of the Cabinet to make in due course an announcement of the decision of Kis Majesty&apos;s Government on the above lines - on which the Foreign Secretary and I are both agreed.      It may be necessary for the announcement to be deferred until the question of the police has been settled, but obviously an announcement should be made as soon as possible.      In working out the details of the measures necessary to give effect to the Commission&apos;s recommendations, there may be minor and technical points on which they may have to be modified; but I do not anticipate that these will raise any questions of general policy.The adoption of the Commission&apos;s recommendations will,  of course, imply that the services of Ministers should be dispensed with.      The Commissioners lay emphasis upon this recommendation,  and I am- satisfied that it is essential that the present anomalous position should be regularised as soon as possible.      It is hoped that the Ministers will resign of their own accord, but if they do not it will be necessary to dispense with their services.I would also point out that the adoption of the Commission&apos;s&apos; recommendations will involve the passage of an Act of Parliament..    It will be seen from the Appendix to C^P.  74 (32) that while questions of the Electoral Law and of language can be dealt with either by local/
Ordinance or by Letters Patent, other matter? &quot;such.-af tha.. police,  the appointment of Judges and the constitution of the Trade Union Council will require Imperial legislation.,    I appreciate that an Act cannot be passed immediately, but I hope that it may be possible to introduce a Bill some time during&apos;the present session. Provided that an announcement of policy can be made in the near future,  the actual date of the passage of the Act will not be a matter of urgent concern.(Intld) P.C-L.IColonial Office.23rd   February,  1932.
