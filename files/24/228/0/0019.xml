nOCTMBKg IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAEUQ^liJSSlIl^^Mi^IS^iO) -S E C R 5 T. Copy No.g.p.69/32)India and the Import Duties Bill. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.It lias hitherto been the custom of the Government of India to take little part in discussions on Imperial Preference beyond saying that India has little to gain from it.   Until the last few months this was broadly true as the class of goods imported from India in large quantities - raw materials, foodstuffs, jute manufactures, etc. - were not regarded as fit subjects for taxation..Tea was always a conspicuously exceptional case but the benefit that India has to gain from preference on tea has increased considerably in recent years owing to growing competition between Java and Indian tea.The argument from ImperisI sentiment has never carried weight with public opinion in India during the Imperial Preference discussions of this century and consequently the lack of any great prospect of material benefit to India from the adoption of the policy has been regarded as an insuperable obstacle to its adoption in India.Nevertheless, in the case of large classes of steel and cotton goods the rate of duty on United Kingdom manufactureshas been fixed at a lower rate than that of the manufactures ofother countries.   The Government of India insist, however, thatit is wrong to call the lower duties on United Kingdom goods&quot;preferential&quot; and right to call them &quot;differential&quot; and attachhigh importance to this point.The reason for imposing the differential duties on steelwas
W3S,very shortly stated, that the Indian Tariff Board found in 1926 that a rate of duty that would give Indian goods adequate protection against goods made of British standard steel would not give them adequate protection against steel of the ordinary Continental kinds.    It was considered desirable in the interests of India to encourage the use of British standard steel for many purposes, and although some classes of Continental steel are equal to the British standard there is no means of testing in India whether particular consignments of Continental steel are up to the British standard.The differentiation in favour of British cotton goods is defended by the Government of India against their critics by a similar line of argument.During the few months since the present Government came into power the argument that India had little to gain from Imperial Preference has become completely out of date.Already under the Abnormal Imports let preference is given to Indian jute manufactures, carpets, and raw and manufactur-ed silk:    (before that there was already a preference on coffee and tobacco which are, however, of secondary import, nee to India.The new British tariff gives India a substantial preference on a large number of commodities on which the imposition of duties was never before contemplated.   These include oil-seeds, oil-cakes, rice, tanned hides and skins, and rubber:, which arc exported from India in really large qualities.   There is also preference on pig-iron, castor-oil and other oils, paraffin wa2 , and handkerchiefs ana s ; lawls;, which, although ihese articles are not quantitatively so important to. India, are likely to give greater satisfaction inIndia
India than preference on her primary products as more national pride is taken in the development of her manufactures than in that of the trade in her primary products.I wrote tc the Viceroy on the 23th January explaining . the great change in policy that was in contemplation. At the time the intention was not to give a preference to the Dominions under the new Act until after bargaining at Ottawa and the wording of my letter was conditioned by this fact,,   I said, after explaining the nature of the proposed negotiations at Ottawa, &quot;The question for us to consider is what part India can take in those negotiations.   It is not a question of asking India to subscribe to the principle of Imperial Preference on grounds of Imperial sentiment, but of inviting her to join in a process of give and take which offers prospects of solid advantage to both parties - or rather I should say to all parties, for I hope that there will bo negotiations between India and the Dominions as well as between India and this country.I hope within a fortnight or two to be able to telegraph to you a list of Indian products on which the British Government will be willing to offer preference to India In return for suitable concessions.My object in writing the present letter is to let you know the lines on which my mind is moving and to enable you to prepare your Government to act with as much expedition and sympathy as possible when a definite proposal is put tc them.Ill talking of return concessions I do not ignore the existence of the Indian differential duties on cotton and steel goods, and I quite appreciate that the value of thesep whatever it may be, will have to be taken intoaccount.
account.It will I suppose be impossible for your Government to enter on the suggested process of bargaining without first obtaining some expression of agreement from the Legislature This &quot;/ill no doubt be a delicate business-, but I do not see why it should bo any more difficult than it was to get the differential duties on steel and cotton goods accepted.I think it may be useful if you or your Commerce Department will talk the matter over with Kershaw while he is in India.    If he comes back with first-hand knowledge of the views of the Government of India it will help us to understand one another at later stages of the discussion.&quot;I now propose to telegraph to the Government of India as follows.S.H.9th February 1932.Draft telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India.Commerce Department,   is you will have seen His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have now announced new tariff policy based on general ten per cent, duty applicable to foreign but not Empire goods. Goods at present dutiable are excluded and provision is made for increasing duties on luxury goods and in cases where-such increase is in interest of British manufacturer.    It is intended that there shall be a small fr:;0 list including wheat,tea
mtea, raw wool and cotton and bullion but no other item of much interest to India.2. Under this new system ten per cent, preference will be given to leading items of Indian trade including oil seeds, oil cakes, castor oil, rice, pig iron, paraffin was, spices, handkerchiefs and shawls, saltpetre, barley, teak, pig lead. In addition India already has preference on jute manufactures, carpets, raw and manufactured silk, under Abnormal Importations Act and on coffee and tobacco under earlier Acts.   Duties under Abnormal Importations Act expire on iGth-May but intention is that commodities affected should come under ten per cent, tariff if ;;oi is not renewed.3* Reason for leaving tea on free list in present legislation has been announced to be that it is thought more convenient to deal with it along with other beverages in ordinary course of Budget.a. Y/hcat is to be dealt with under quota system, offering prospect of further benefit to India.5t Although it cannot be guaranteed that none of the items specified in paragraph 2 will be transferred to free list,l^P-not at pr^s^t^vtaciaate that such transfers will be it may oe taken as certainmade on a scale that will materially impair benefit to be derived by India.6. Intention is that so far as Dominions, India and Southern Rhodesia are concerned, neither general nor additional duties shall become operative before conclusion of Ottawa Conference. After the Conference its results can be embodied in whatever modification of the duties may have been agreed on.That
That is tc say continuance of exemption of Dominions and India from any or all duties in whole or in part will depend on character of benefits which Dominions and India are prepared tc offer in return at Ottawa.7. Preliminary discussions are already taking place between representatives cf Great Britain and Dominions both in London and in Dominions.b. Your Government will at ence recognise that this completely revolutionises the position as bet-toon India and United Kingdom, and that it is now entirely incorrect to say, as has always been said In the past, that India has litele to gain from Imperial preference.      After Ottawa position will be that India will stand to lose heavily if she dees not come into scheme of mutual preferences to be worked out there.9. As between United Kingdom and Dominions it is hoped that new policy will be welcomed on grounds of Imperial sentimen but where such sentiment is lacking, pure self-interest will be powerful inducement to come into scheme.10. Please consider with minimum cf delay important questions raised and let me know hew scon you will be able to engage in preliminary discussions such as are referred to in paragraph 7.11. In order to avoid misunderstanding it should be added that United Kingdom Government have undertaken not to enter into any new tariff arrangement with any foreign country nefore Ottawa but have announced that after Ottawa they will bo prepared to negotiate with foreign governments for reductions of duty.    It will therefore be natural for representatives of Dominions and India at Ottawa in bargaining to ask in certain cases not only for retention of free entry of their products butalso for maintenance cf duties on foreign products of the same class.
