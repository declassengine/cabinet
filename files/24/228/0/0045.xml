this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government323Printed for the. Cabinet.   March 1932.SECRET. Copy No.    9CP. 95 (32).CABINET.DISARMAMENT AND SANCTIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his analysis of the situation with regard to the Disarmament Conference [CP. 78 (32)] has put before the Cabinet some of the difficulties which have occurred to him in connexion with the French proposals. In paragraph 8 of his memorandum Sir John Simon suggests the question, what would have been the effect of the French scheme, if it had already been in force, in relation to the Far Eastern situation ? Having regaid especially to that situation, I have been thinking over, very carefully, the ideas and implications in the French proposals, and in the following paper I have attempted to set out the preliminary conclusions to which I have been drawn, looking at the matter both from the Dominions point of view and from my own experience at Geneva.2. The French proposals are in effect a revival of ideas contained in the Geneva Protocol of 1924, in particular the application of automatic sanctions, the definition of the aggressor, and the formation of an international punitive force. The attitude of the Dominions to proposals of this kind is shown in the correspondence relating to the Protocol published in Cmd. 2458.I would draw special attention to the following passages : Canada.&apos;&apos; First, we should continue to give whole-hearted support to the League of Nations and particularly to its work of conciliation, co-operation and publicity. Second, we do not consider it in the interests of Canada, of the British Empire, or of the League itself to recommend to Parliament adherence to the Protocol and particularly to its rigid provisions for application of Economic and Military sanctions in every future war. Among the grounds for this conclusion is the consideration of the effect of non-participation of the United States upon the attempt to enforce sanctions, and particularly so in the case of contiguous countries like Canada.&quot;Commonwealth of A australia.&quot; The development of a spirit of mutual confidence amongst Nations will, it is believed, contribute more effectively to prepare public opinion to accept disarmament than the setting up of the most elaborate machinery for settlement of disputes. Whilst, therefore, sympathising entirely with the spirit of the Protocol, which was designed with the object of strengthening the League, my Government sees very serious objection to the methods proposed. Apart from being distinctly unacceptable to Australia, for the reasons already given, it will have the effect of still further alienating Nations who are already hesitant about accepting the authority of the League, and will in the present state of International opinion defeat the object which the designers of the Protocol had in view. We are anxious that the authority of the League should grow, but as its authority depends mainly on the spirit which animates its members we are opposed to what, in the circumstances,, must be regarded as a dangerous attempt to accelerate its growth.&quot;T67131
&apos; New Zealand.&apos; Great Britain will always keep faith in the letter and the spirit with any obligations it signs. If other nations are to be similarly bound to /conform to the letter and the spirit, both must be defined with far greater accuracy than has been attempted in the terms of the Protocol. But, apart from the form of expression, the intention and effect of the document itself is not in accord with common sense, however much it may accord with visionary doctrines.&quot;Union of South A frica. ,&quot; To accept the Protocol, Ministers feel, would be only to make it more difficult for countries at present outside the League, notably America, to become members, and would consequently contribute very materially to making it impossible for the League to attain its real object, and so give an additional impulse to the diversion of its activities in the direction of an alliance having as its object the maintenance of a balance of power.....Ministers feel they are called upon to exercise particular vigilance and to bestow particular attention upon the peculiar position and interests of South Africa, and are of the opinion that these interests demand that no international obligations should be entered into which may entail a participa-tion and interference by the Union in matters which do not, or only remotely, concern her and whereby her real and proper interests may eventually be jeopardized.&quot;Irish Free State.&quot;The Covenant of the League of Nations makes provisions for certain sanctions in the case of a State which resorts to war in disregard of its obligations. It has always appeared to us that the application of these sanctions would present grave difficulties, and that the machinery for effecting them would in practice prove unworkable. It is true that sanctions could in all probability be effectively enforced against a relatively small State engaged in hostile operations for purposes of aggrandisement, where the verdict of the world-conscience would be unanimous in condemnation of the objects for which resort was had to war. But it appears equally evident that, in the case of aggressive acts by one or other of the greater Powers, and particularly where world opinion was divided as to the merits of the dispute, the sanctions could not be enforced. We are, accordingly, forced to the conclusion that, while the sanctions of the Covenant may prove a useful deterrent in the case of small and turbulent communities, they are quite powerless to prevent either the oppression by a larger Power of small States or the occurrence of a war of world magnitude. It may also be observed that the application of sanctions implies the maintenance of armaments rather than their abolition, and in this respect is scarcely compatible with one of the primary objects of the Protocol, viz., Disarmament. The portions of the Covenant, therefore, dealing with the imposition of sanctions appear to us to be the least valuable for the general purposes of the Covenant, and an extension of these provisions, such as is contemplated in the Protocol, the least profitable avenue of exploration towards improvement ....&quot; If we might express an opinion upon the measures by which these - aspirations \_i.e., the aspirations of the founders of the League] may best be realised, and naturally we do so with the utmost diffidence, we would suggest that the solution is to be found not in an endeavour to close some of the fissures in the Covenant by elaborate definition or drastic sanction, but rather in an effort to enhance the moral influence of international conscience. An extension of the principle of arbitration which serves to define and enunciate international judgment, and which relies in the last resort on the moral pressure of world opinion and not upon the application of material sanctions, appears to us to be the most effective feasible metins of attaining, at least in a large measure, the objects which the Protocol has in view.&quot;3. The attitude of the Dominions, as shown in the above passages, has been consistently their attitude since the foundation of the League. At the very outset the Canadian Government put forward a proposal for the deletion of Article 10 of the Covenant (which provides the measures to be taken against aggression&apos; or the threat of aggression), on the ground that the Article involved commitments
which they could not undertake in advance. Failing in this, the Canadian Government first proposed the amendment of: the Article, and later, when this attempt was not successful, they endeavoured to secure their end by means,of an interpretative Resolution of the Assembly, allowing a certain discretion to the Members of the League as to the action to be taken under the Article. This failed to secure adoption (owing to the single adverse vote of Persia), but there is no doubt that it still represents the view of Canada.4. A similar attitude was shown, especially by the Canadian, New Zealand and Union Governments, in the discussions in 1930 regarding the General Act and Amendments to the Covenant. In a conversation at the Dominions Office, Sir Robert Borden expressed the following views. I quote from a memorandum of the conversation made at the time : &quot; Personally, he thought a moral sanction, such as that of the Peace Pact, worth far more than complicated legal sanctions, and for himself he would be content if we had &quot; (1) a covenant not to resort to war in any circumstances;&quot; (2) a covenant under the Optional Clause to refer all justiciabledisputes to The Hague Court; &quot; (3) a covenant to refer non-justiciable disputes to the Council or somesimple form of conciliation machinery, only bringing in thecompulsion  to  refer  to  a neutral umpire  if  conciliation machinery broke down.&quot; Sir Robert Borden also expressed the prima facie view that it was a mistake to confine the General Act to Members of the League. We ought to make our new house with a door which the United States could enter if they chose.&quot;General Hertzogs views are recorded as follows in the note of a discussion between him and Lord Cecil : ;&apos; He thought that a procedure whereby the Council was, in effect, a tribunal giving a final decision and a body executing that decision, involved the combination in one body of the functions of the judicature and the executive. He thought that the strength of the League lay in moral rather material sanctions, and that there was more prospect of the Council arriving at a just decision, which would be accepted loyally by both Parties to a dispute if the obligation to accept such a decision rested solely on a moral basis and not also on a treaty basis.&quot;5. When, at the time of the London Naval Conference, the Question of an interpretative resolution with regard to article 16 of the Covenant was under discussion, the Dominion representatives showed considerable apprehension lest this should involve additional commitments. The course of the discussions indicates that it was very doubtful how far they would have been ready to co-operate in subscribing to such a resolution.6. Underlying all these views is the settled policy of the Dominions that they will not be committed beforehand, in relation either to this country or to the League, to participation in any hostilities, without, the approval of their own Parliaments and peoples. In the case of the Irish Free State, this is definitely embodied in article 49 of the Constitution. I might perhaps add that, if my reading of public opinion in this country is correct., the above view is very widely shared here.7. The latest expression of the Dominions&apos; point of view is contained in the opening speeches of their Representatives at the Disarmament Conference. I may quote in particular the remarks of Sir George Perley on behalf of Canada, which deserve the most careful reading : ;&apos; In respect to the organisation of peace, the importance of which we appreciate, we recognise the value of the many agreements that have been made during the last twelve years, and we are convinced that those agreements should, already have resulted in a marked reduction of armaments, rather than in the disturbing increases, which, in many cases, the published figures show. We think, further, that this organisation of peace can best be achieved at this time by emphasising the prevention of
conflict, rather than the punishment of aggression; by building up machinery for conciliation, rather than providing for sanctions; by using the League of Nations as a channel through which international public opinion can express itself, rather than by developing it into a super-State. , In adopting this view, which we genuinely consider to be a constructive one, &apos; we are convinced that we are serving, not merely our own interests, but the true interests of all nations as well.&quot;Mr. te Water, speaking on behalf of the Union, also said : -&quot; May I also here assure the French delegation that my Government has always viewed its concept of the League of Nations as a super-State with the liveliest interest.&quot; If it has not hitherto accorded that conception its support, it is perhaps for the very reason stated so concisely in the French proposal; that of an uncompromising attitude of national sovereignty.&apos;&apos; My Government is, moreover, uncertain still of the power of the League of Nations to function without prejudice and without bias while the nations represented round its tables have behind them the power of their armaments to influence its decisions.&quot;8. It will be seen from the above summary of Dominion opinion that, so far from supporting proposals for strengthening the provisions for sanctions in the Covenant, they would favour a policy of diminishing or even eliminating those sanctions both on the ground that the automatic obligation to impose sanctions (wdiich, in any case, they regard as of doubtful efficacy in maintaining peace) is inconsistent with their idea of national sovereignty and on the ground that their existence renders more difficult co-operation with the United States to which Canada in ])articular attaches the greatest importance.9. The general attitude described in the preceding paragraph has, I suggest, received striking confirmation from recent events in the Far East. The existence of the sanction provisions has merely been an embarrassment, and a hindrance to the preservation of peace rather than a help. On the one hand, the realisation that it wras impossible to impose these sanctions has placed grave obstacles in the way of diplomacy, while on the other hand their existence in the background has stiffened the attitude both of China and of Japan.10. To my mind, the great value of the League is as the moral organiser of world opinion, and I am confirmed in this view by my recent visit to Geneva. World opinion is becoming more and more the determining factor in international affairs, especially as the developments of modern science, e.g., the invention of wireless, are rendering the mobilisation of that opinion more practicable, immediate and effective. Persuasion, and not force, should be the key-note of the League.11. My own experience of trade union affairs lends support to these view^s. There was a time when many, both in this country and the Dominions, believed in the efficacy of compulsory arbitration in trade disputes. But experience has shown that lasting peace can best be achieved by methods of voluntary concilia-tion rather than of compulsory arbitration. Australia, wdiich at one time was the protagonist in the adoption of compulsory arbitration for trade disputes, has now abandoned it (except in the case of two States) in favour of conciliation, at any rate in the first instance. In Canada also the accepted system is that of conciliation. To my mind, this lesson might well be applied to international affairs.12. Of course, I most fully realise the difficulties inherent in the adoption of any such policy, especially in view of the persistent attitude of France, who seeks to make the League the instrument of her national will, and it is not for me to speak on this side of the question. But the attractions of such a policy as I have indicated are so manifest, both in making the Covenant a really more effective instrument for preserving world peace, and in rendering easier co-opera-tion with the Dominions and the United States, and possibly even in securing the adherence of the United States to the League, which would be of inestimable benefit to the whole world, that I venture to think that the question merits the-most careful immediate examination.(Initialled) J.
