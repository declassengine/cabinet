this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1932.SECRET. Copy No.    39CP. 82 (32).CABINET.DISARMAMENT.Air Disarmament and the Abolition of Bombing Aircraft.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.Part I. Preliminary.IN CP. 44 (32) the Secretary of State for India has raised certain questions-in connection with what is commonly styled the &quot;Knock-out Blow.&quot; One suggestion he makes is the restriction of bombing aeroplanes&apos;, though he explicitly recognises the difficulties inherent in any such proposal. I ought perhaps to place on record a brief note of what these difficulties are for, unfortunately, they are very far from stopping at the specific illustration cited by Sir Samuel Hoare. Erom this negative criticism I shall proceed briefly to positive suggestions in the only directions in which it seems to me there is real hope of progress in the matter of aerial disarmament. Accordingly, I subdivide the remainder of this memo-randum into two parts which for convenience I will designate as &quot;Negative&apos;&quot; and &quot; Positive.&quot;Part II. Negative.It is my personal view that in dealing with the complex problems inseparable from Disarmament more particularly when investigating a suggestion to which everyone must feel sympathetic in principle it is permissible to draw a distinction between technical objections which are theoretical or hypothetical and those which are practical and already existent. It is to the latter that, generally speaking, most weight must naturally attach.Unfortunately it is practical and existent difficulties which, as I see itr offer a virtually insuperable obstacle to implementing any proposal to restrict the numbers of bombing as opposed to other categories of military aircraft.First of all it is undeniable that all types of aircraft which exist to-day are susceptible of use as bombers, though no doubt their efficacy in this role varies according to their capacity and performance. But this is not the main difficulty. The most efficient day-bomber in the world to-day is, by common admission, the high-performance &apos;&apos; Hart &quot; machine recently introduced into service in the Royal Air Force. But this identical machine is also going into service (1) in Army Co-operation squadrons and (2) in Naval Co-operation units for Fleet Fighter/ Reconnaissance duties. Moreover, it is already in experimental use in the one role which is universally agreed to be defensive in character, i.e., as a two-seater fighter for Home Defence, as there is a school of thought which holds that a two-seater or multi-seater fighter is likely to prove more efficient (and afford better protection to its personnel) than a single-seater.I can see no way out of the resultant dilemma. The difficulty could not be evaded by ignoring considerations of technical efficiency and substituting a different type of machine in units for Army Co-operation duties and for Fleet[6632]
Fighter/Reconnaissance work with the Navy even if we leave aside the question of the use of the &quot; Hart &quot; machine in a purely defensive role as a fighter. For aircraft for the duties specified must be of broadly similar design to ordinary bombing aircraft, i.e., two or three seaters with the highest performance consistent with the carriage of an adequate military load. I may add that the &quot; General Purposes &quot; type of aircraft so effectively employed by the Royal Air Force in theatres such as Iraq and Trans-Jordan, at Aden and on the Indian Frontier also embodies broadly similar characteristics and requirements. It is important, moreover, to bear in mind that this is a type of aircraft which has achieved savings to the National Exchequer running into many millions and (equally important), as distinguished political officers such as Sir Percy Cox and Sir Henry Dobbs have emphatically testified, its use has also brought about great savings of human life on our own side as well as the enemy&apos;s.*Nor do these manifold roles of the &apos;&apos; Hart &apos;&apos; in other than bombing units constitute a novel or unexpected phenomenon. A type of machine utilised by some of the numerous squadrons which the French maintain for purposes of Army Co-operation duties is identical (save for extra tankage and other insignificant variations) with their standard day-bomber.As the first-line strength of the French Army Co-operation Squadrons is some six times our corresponding figure it equals indeed the total strength of all types in our Home Defence Force proper it is obvious that any restriction purporting to circumscribe the number of bombing aircraft or units comprising such aircraft might well result, if the French claimed (as they probably would) that their Army Co-operation units must be exempted, in loading the dice still more heavily indeed disastrously in their favour.as against this country. This result would be still further accentuated in another direction, since the importance of Civil Aviation machines for bombing operations would be enormously enhanced by any reduction in the number of military bombing aircraft and to-day (leaving out of account light aircraft as of materially less, though by no means negligible, utility in this particular role) France could dispose of some 270 medium or large civil machines against some 32 in this country.Part III. Positive.To me the conclusion appears inevitable that the most hopeful line of progress is that which I have consistently advocated, viz., a straightforward reduction of first-line strengths primarily on the part of the French with their overwhelming air preponderance. As I have already tentatively suggested, this might be made more palatable by an agreement on Anglo-Franco-Italian air strengths on the general lines advocated by Sir Samuel Hoare in 1928 coupled with a specific guarantee of material assistance in the event of aggression. Such assistance is, I take it, inherent in the Locarno Treaty; a specific guarantee of the kind I have in mind would, if the terms of the guarantee are carefully framed, in fact really add nothing to our commitments, whilst going a long way towards meeting the French insistence on &quot;Security.&quot; I think the Cabinet should most seriously consider this course. I am fully alive to the weighty political objections to Continental entanglements. If, however, the country could be made to realise (i) that all that was proposed was to give greater definition to the already existing, but unformulated, commitments of the Locarno Treaty;(ii) that the cause of peace in Europe would be greatly advanced, and in particular(iii) that concrete progress in the sphere of air disarmament could only be achieved by these means; (iv) that we were not pledging ourselves to any one country rather than another, i.e., that, as under the Locarno provisions, France, Germany and Belgium would all alike receive succour from ourselves and Italy, if innocent* &quot;In every instance air action was only necessary on a surprisingly limited scale. Had it been necessary to exact obedience by the employment of ground troops, the cost in time and money, if not also in lives, would have been immensely greater.&quot; Sir Percy Cox.&apos;&apos; There has been an immense saving of blood and treasure to the British and Iraq Governments. In earlier times punitive columns would have had to struggle towards their, objectives across deserts or through dirlicult defiles, compelled by the necessities of their preparations and marches to give time for their opponents to gain strength. But now, almost before the would-be rebel has formulated his plans, the droning of the aeroplane is heard overhead, and in the majority of cases their mere appearance is enough.&quot; Sra Henry Dobbs.
-victims of aggression; and lastly (v) that Great Britain should benefit more than any other country by the removal of our present very disquieting inferiority in the air, I myself am inclined to question whether any serious opposition need be anticipated.L.Air Ministry, February 4, 1932.Postscript. The foregoing memorandum was prepared before the French propounded their elaborate scheme at Geneva. I refrain for the moment from detailed comments on their proposals, but my colleagues may be interested to learn of another immediate and serious technical difficulty involved in one important feature of a scheme which, for all its pseudo-scientific appearance, is singularly unpractical. All heavy bombers above a certain limit are to be placed under the control of the League, and stationed wherever the League may determine. Now the largest type of bomber in use in the Royal Air Force to-day is the so-called Bomber-Transport aircraft a most promising type of great potentialities, which has fulfilled important roles in the Middle East for a long-time past. It is a type which is peculiarly discriminating in its operations, since it is equally susceptible of use for the transport of considerable numbers of personnel (its primary function), or, in the last resort, for bombing, thus permitting the application of force according to the needs of each particular situation in the most humane form practicable. For example, a company of troops can be carried urgently by air to deal with riots in the crowded streets of a city, or bombs can be dropped on rebellious tribesmen or a band of armed brigands moving in open country, with equal facility. It was this type which, in the winter of 1928, evacuated 586 individuals of 11 different nationalities from Kabul; which a year or two since conveyed the first reinforcing troops to deal with the riots in Jeursalem; which only last year transported 126 officers and men on emergency over the sea to Cyprus; and which has, during the last few years, repeatedly carried out minor operations of a similar character. I think it can be stated with assurance that under the French proposal whereby the League would have these aircraft at their beck and call, and be responsible for settling their location, not a single one of these life-saving operations, from Kabul downwards, could have been accomplished.There is one other suggestion I have to make. If it be thought that the British delegation ought, in the matter of aerial disarmament, to make some further concrete gesture at this juncture, it occurs to me we might propose the immediate appointment of a really authoritative Commission of jurists and naval, military and air experts with a positive mandate to frame a code for the better protection of the civilian population, not only against bombardment from the air, but also against bombardment by land and sea. Such a proposal would appear to accord with, but carry a stage further and to greater definition, one of the points made by the United States delegation, whose support it might there-fore command.L.British Delegation,&apos;Geneva, February 17, 1932.
