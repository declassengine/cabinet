[This document is the Property ol His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1932.- CjCopy No........CABINET.Reports by Local Governments on the Political Situation in India.MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.The latest weekly reports from the Local Governments in India are circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for India.India Office, 2nd February 1932.Bombay.The situation continued quiet in almost all the Mofussil districts with no new developments. The Independence Day celebrations proved a complete failure every-where. Illegal activities, where reported, are now mostly conducted by youths and irresponsible persons and excite little interest. Land revenue collections are so far good. One case of cutting telegraph wires is again reported from Belgaum. Feeble attempts at forest Satyagraha occurred in Satara, Belgaum and Kanara. Some toddy tree cutting is again reported from Belgaum. All mills were closed for two days in Ahmedabad on account of the prosecution of the two secretaries of the Labour Union. Behaviour of mill-hands was exemplaiy. A successful durbar was held by the Commissioner, Central Division, at Nasik. Meetings held on tour by the Com-missioner, Southern Division, were largely attended, and the attitude of the people friendly. In Bombay city, picketing of foreign cloth shops and the mint continued. Total arrests for picketing, 44. Certain exchange banks have been picketed since the 2Sth instant. Although the Share and Stock Brokers&apos; Association decided to keep the Stock Exchange open three days weekly, no business was done and Government have addressed the Association regarding its charter. Question of reopening the Share Bazaar is consequently being reconsidered. As a result of the hartal, the cloth markets closed on the 23rd, 25th and 27th, and these and other bazaars closed for one week from the 28th as a protest against the arrival of the Round Table Conference Committees. Attempted anti-Bound Table Conference demonstrations yesterday failed. Independence Day celebrations in Bomba37 city on 2Cth gave no difficulty&apos;&apos;, but hooligaus lighted bonhres in the street at night, burnt one police chowki and stoned a police station. Two rounds were fired by the police, but no injuries resulted. Similar hooliganism occurred on subsequent nights, ending in more serious disturbances on the night of the 29th, when, following the dispersal of the Frontier Day processions in the Kalbadevi area, the police were repeatedly stoned by mobs parading in the streets and attempting arson, and 12 rounds were fired, resulting&quot; in one rioter killed and 19 injured.The following is the action taken under Ordinances : 153 arrests during the week under section 3 of the Emergency Bowers Ordinance ; 35 arrests for breach of orders under section 4 ; under Ordinance IV, the total number of buildings so far occupied is 86. Balance of Tilak Swaraj Fund and funds of Bombay Provincial Congress Committee, totalling Rs. 40,246 in two Bombay banks, have been declared forfeited under subsection 1 of section 7.Bengal.In Calcutta, Independence Day failed to produce the intended serious clash with the police. The programme elsewhere was frustrated, but 100 persons were arrested in Noakhali. The week&apos;s demonstrations in Calcutta, which have been the work of small groups of youths, averaging a dozen, have been dispersed without serious use of force. The public are uninterested. The movement is stationary, but there has been increased activity in some localities.   There has been marked improvement in secret.CP. 62 (32).671      60   2.32
the tone of the Indian Press since the issue of the warning circular. Commissioners and magistrates holding durbars and explaining the Governments policy have had large attentive audiences. Weeks arrests under section 3, Emergency Powers Ordinance, total 53.   No new development.United Provinces.The situation generally has improved. There was a slight recrudescence, of agitation on the 26th, owing to the Independence Day celebrations, which necessitated some arrests in a few of the larger towns. Cawnpore, Allahabad and Lucknow are quieter. Picketing on a small scale is reported from seven districts, but the main effort is now directed towards the silent boycott. Three incidents ending in the use of firearms are reported ; the first, at Ramkola, Gorakhpur district, when the police were threatened when making arrests, and fired two shots to overawe the crowds. No casualties resulted. The second was a similar incident at Meja, Allahabad district, of which details ai-e lacking. The third was a more serious case at Simaria, Hardoi district, which was fully reported yesterday and the subject of a communique which has been issued. Rent and revenue are reported to be coming in more normally, except in parts of Allahabad and Fatehpur districts, where the tenants are still recusant. Convictions during week are : Under the Ordinance, 304 ; under ordinary law, 366.   Total convictions up to date, 2,293 ; released on probation or apology, 352.Central Provinces.The only important events of the week were the arrest of Aney, the Berar leader, -who is a member of the All-India Congress Working Committee, and the meeting held at the Town Hall, Nagpur, under the presidentship of Parakh, President, Nagpur Municipality, to condemn the policy of Government of India and rule by Ordinances. This meeting was convened by Liberal and non-Congress elements. In Nagpur Division, Independence Day was a failure and touring officers are reported to be receiving a welcome from the villagers everywhere. In Chhattisgarh Division, the situation has been quiet, and the Independence Day meeting at Raipur had an audience of 2&apos;UO only, mostly school-children. In Jubbulpore Division there is nothing of interest to report except the secret distribution of leaflets instigating to non-payment of; rent and threatening the police. An independence Day meeting in Khandwa was declared unlawful and two women, including a new dictator, were arrested. In Berar Division, Congress has not made any headway during the week and the round-up of leaders continues steadily. Molestation Ordinance was enforced in VVardha and Chhindwara districts. The total of prosecutions to date is 327, convictions 2d7. Fines imposed total Rs. 39,000. Emergency Powers Ordinance has not been applied in this Province.Punjab.In the Province generally, the response to Congress continues to be poor. In Lahore, arrests and restrictive orders passed at the beginning of the week have produced a quieter atmosphere. Amritsar continues to be quiet, though underground efforts are being made to bring in both the Ahrars and the Akalis. There have been ineffectual attempts at picketing in Lyallpur, Kafnal and Jnllundur, where arrests have been 17, 13 and 8 respectively. Total arrests for the week ending 29th under ^Ordinances,. 101; under ordinary law, 36. Restrictive orders number 29, of which -one only has resulted in a prosecution. The best Punjab Hindu opinion is against civil disobedience. There is a tendency in certain influential Muslim quarters to seize the opportunity afforded by the difficulties of the present situation to press for a settlement of the communal problem before supporting the Round Table Committees, but the Muslims generally have little, if any, genuine sympathy with Congress as such. Effect of the movement, on business in Amritsar has been small and in Lahore .and elsewhere not appreciable.North-West Frontier Province.The improvement in Bannu and Ivohat districts has been maintained. In Tank, &quot;the situation has improved, and troops, which were sent there as a precautionary measure, have been withdrawn. The situation is unchanged in the Peshawar district, but some attempts are being made to organise agitation after the Id, in the city and surrounding villages. Revenue payments are excellent throughout the district. Prisoners concentrated in Haripur -Tail are in a state of indiscipline and police
reinforcements and a detachment of British troops are being sent. In the Trans-frontier area, Congress propaganda has affected the Dir tribes east of the Panjkora River, who have attacked and captured some levy posts on the Chitral road. The situation is not serious in itself, but there is danger of trouble spreading to the Bajaur tribes, who have already received a message from a hostile Mullah calling for action after the Id. A small column of troops has been sent to Chakdarra as a precautionary measure, and warning notices were served to-day on the tribes in Uyhiri, Niag and Tormung Valleys, east of Panjkora River, to the effect that bombing from the air will begin to-morrow and continue until their jirga arrives at Chakdarra with hostages. There are some indications of possible trouble in South Waziristan after the Id, due partly to Congress propaganda from Tank and partly to the return of Ramzan, the leader of the Mahsud Congress lashkar in 1930, and, subsequently, of the Mahsud contingent, which achieved fame in lighting for the Afghans in Turkestan. Two arrests have been made under the Ordinance.Madras.The situation is much the same as last week. Sporadic picketing continues in some areas. In Telugu and Detta district, signs of increased activity have been noticed, suggesting a recovery from the shock of the Oovernment&quot;s initial action. Suitable action is being taken, but this development is not viewed seriously. Revenue collection in this area is very satisfactory ; elsewhere thex-e are few signs of activity and in some districts none at all. Twelve more associations have been declared unlawful, making a total of 101. Security has been demanded from one more press and one more newspaper, making a total of three each.Bihar and Orissa.The movement has intensified in Tirhut Division, where it has taken the form of numerous organised attempts to celebrate Independence Day by taking out processions. Muzaffarpur district reports such attempts in each Theina jurisdiction. In MuZaffarpur, Motihari and Darbhanga processions consisted of villagers brought in from villages, probably due to the activities of Congress workers dispersed in the rural areas. At Motihari police and District Officers were attacked and forced to fire. A slight attack was made on the police at one village in the Saran district. No -change in rest of the Province, but probably further attempts will be made to -celebrate days.   Convictions up to 23rd January were 1,352.Burma.The week has been comparatively uneventful. Surrenders continue, but no important leaders have been accounted for. The situation in Zigon subdivision continues to improve. No Government casualties are reported. Sixty-eight under-trials have been released and the number remaining in custody is 589. The price of paddy continues to rise slightly, and is now about 90. The collection of taxes continues satisfactory. The number on relief works remains at between 10,000 and 11,000.Ajmer Merwara.Since the last report, 23 persons have been arrested in the district for participating in the civil disobedience movement. Half-hearted attempts were made by a few persons to organise processions on the 20th January, Independence Day, in the district, but were frustrated by the police. There was no response from the public. A few voluuteers began picketing two foreign cloth shops in Beawar, but, finding their efforts entirely ineffective, soon, desisted of their own accord. There has been no political agitation in Kekri. The inhabitants of the district, with very few exceptions, are keeping aloof from the movement, and such attempts as are made to keep it alive are being made by leaders and volunteers from the neighbouring States or other Provinces. Their arrests and prosecutions provoke no demonstration of sympathy from the public.From the Hesident in Mysore.In Bangalore, convictions up to  date number 89.   Activities appear  to  be definitely on the wane.   Although Ordinances 4 and 5 are now in force, there have been no convictions under them up to date.    In Coorg, Congress activities are -decreasing.   The situation is very satisfactory.
Government of India.Delhi reports increasing agitation and some excitement, resulting in assaults on individual police on Frontier Day.   The general atmosphere is not unfavourable.2. Features of the week are : (a) A growing tendency towards violence, as instanced by organised hooliganism in Bombay city and several clashes necessitating firing elsewhere.(b) Tendency for agitation to extend in some areas.(c) Tribal unrest in Dir territory, which now shows signs of clearing up, and some indications of possible trouble among one or two other tribes. The general tribal situation is satisfactory within the five settled districts of the North-West Frontier Province. Action is now necessary on a very limited scale, but some time may elapse before the restoration of normal conditions, and the movement is by no means suppressed.(d) Comparative inactivity in Madras, Central Provinces and the majority of districts.   In other Provinces, the trouble is at present localised.(e) Definite improvement in United Provinces in spite of Independence Day celebrations on 26th. These were intended to stimulate excitement all over-India and the comparatively small results achieved are satisfactory. Similarly for Frontier Day held on 29th.(/) On the whole, such deterioration as there is to report is not in excess of normal expectations and there is still an absence of sustained agitation, except in a comparatively small number of places.3. There has been serious trouble in Kashmir which has taken a communal form and has already affected large areas. There are signs of its extension and the situation, is the cause of some anxiety.
