In the Japanese ultimatum of February 18th which preceded the serious fighting it was stated that if the Chinese withdrew 20 kilometres the Japanese troops would maintain only the municipal roads area adjacent to Fongkew.-The failure of the Chinese to accept the ultimatum would perhaps be alleged by the Japanese to invalidate the offer,3.     During Sir 1.0. Lampson&apos;s negotiations before the ultimatum the principle of mutual withdrawal was accepted unequivocably by the Chinese but only guardedly by the Japanese.4.     After the fighting began in earnest sir F. Lindley suggested privately that the Japanese should &quot;take a big &quot;step and offer withdrawal of all troops except marines in &quot;the International Settlement on condition that theChinese
2,&quot;Chinese retired to a good distance&quot;.     The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied after consideration that he could not carry the suggestion, which he had welcomed, against mi litary opini on.5.     The next step was the Sino-Japanese meeting on February 28th in the &quot;Kent&quot; to discuss terms for a cessation of fighting.     The meeting was locally engineered.     The &quot;principle of mutual and simultaneous evacuation was agreed&quot;c &quot;The Japanese are to withdraw to Settlement and Hongkew &quot;salient or as near same as large number of troops,can he &quot;quartered&quot;.     The Chinese were represented by their Commander-in-Chief and his Chief of Staff and by a member of their Committee for Foreign Affairs, the Japanese by their naval Commander-in-Chief and a civilian of very high standing but the Japanese army was not represented.     The Japanese almost raised the question of demilitarising the whole 20 kilometres zone but were checked.     The terms were referred to the Chinese Government and after consultation with the Japanese Minister and the military, to the Japanese Government06.     Acquainted with this development the Council of the League on February 29th made to both parties the follow-ing proposal for a conference.The Conference would be undertaken on basis (A) that Japan has no political or territorial designs and no intention of establishing a Japanese settlement in Shanghai or of otherwise advancing exclusive interests of Japanese and (B) that China enters the Conference on basis that safety and integrity of International and French settlements must be preserved under arrangements which will secure these areas
areas and their residents from danger.The meeting of this Conference is of course subject to making local arrangements for a cessation of hostilities. Military, Naval and Civil authorities of principal Powers represented in Shanghai would render all possible assistance in consolidating arrangements,To this proposal which is aimed at immediate re-establishment of peace in Shanghai area without prejudice to or qualification of any position previously taken up by League of Nations or any Power in relation to Sino-Japanese affairs the President invited adherence and co-operation both of China and Japan and of other Powers refer-red to.     Chinese and Japanese delegates undertook to recommend proposal to their Governments07.     On February 29th the Chinese civilian representa-tive handed to Admiral Kelly in writing five points, the most important being mutual and simultaneous evacuation, the Japanese withdrawing to the Settlement and extra-concession (municipally controlled) roads (i0e0 practical-ly the Fongkew salient) and &quot;withdrawal of Japanese to ships &quot;to be taken at the next conference&quot;.     Admiral Kelly thought these terms should, according to the conference of the day before, form an acceptable basis for discussion,8.     On March 2nd the terms approved by the Japanese Government were handed to Admiral Kelly, and by him to the Chinese;   they were as follows:-(1)   Should China give assurance for the withdrawal of her troops to a certain distance from Shanghai (distance to be determined by Japanese and Chinese authorities),Japan
Japan will agree to cessation of hostilities for a certain period (to be agreed upon between Japanese and Chinese authorities), and pending subsequent arrangements Japanese and Chinese forces shall hold their respective positions. Details relating to cessation of hostilities shall be arranged &quot;by Japanese and Chinese military authorities.(2)   Luring the period of cessation of hostilities a round -cable conference between Japan and China shall be held at Shanghai in which the representatives of principal Powers interested shall participate and conference shall discuss with a view to reaching an agreement upon methods for the withdrawal of both. Chinese and Japanese forces on such terms as are cot out in the following paragraph together with measures for restoration and maintenance of peace and order in and around Shanghai and for safeguarding International Settlement and French Concession in Shanghai and foreign lives and property and interests therein.(3)   The withdrawal of troops shall be commenced by Chinese troops (including plain clothes gunmen) to a specified distance and upon ascertaining the withdrawal of Chinese forces their (i.o. Japanese) forces will withdraw to Shanghai and Woosung areas.     As soon as normal con-ditions will have prevailed Japanese army shall be witb-drawn from these areas,(4)   Should either of the parties infringe any of the terms for cessation of hostilities the other party shall have freedom of action.     Both parties to have the same free-dor; of action upon the expiration of period agreed upon under paragraph one,,&quot;
9.     The Japanese later (March 5th ?) at Admiral Kelly&apos;s request handed him the &quot;full Japanese text&quot; of the terms.     This text virtually adds another condition, as it includes a preamble referring to the promise of the Mayor cf Shanghai on January 28th regarding a cessation of anti-Japanese movements and stating that &quot;together with the &quot;commencement of deliberation in connexion with cessation &quot;of war Japanese would of course demand enforcement of an &quot;efficient and reliable prohibition of all anti-Japanese &quot;movements&quot;.100     On March 3rd the Chinese troops withdrew all along the line (apparently for fear of being outflanked by the Japanese reinforcements landed to the north) and the Japanese gave orders to cease hostilities as from 2o0 p0m, The Chinese were informed, and Admiral Kelly understood that they were issuing similar orders;   this turned out not to be the case.     The Chinese expressed willingness to meet the Japanese again to discuss an armistice without prejudice to the other points raised in the Japanese terms (paragraph 8 above) which they were afraid of seeming to accept011.     The Japanese Minister referred the Chinese offer to Tokyo for instructions,,    Prom secret sources we know that he was disturbed as to the compatibility of the Japanese t erms (p paragraph 8 ab ov e) with Jap an es e c ommi allotments, especially in the &quot;Kent&quot;, as regards mutual withdrawal of troops, the distance for the Chinese withdrawal and abstention from insisting on a permanent demilitarised zone (M. Matsudaira had informed the Secretary of State on February 26th that the report of a Japanese intention to set up neutral zones round the principal treaty ports was entirely
entirely unfounded, observing that it would be a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty).   From secret sources we know that the Japanese military at Shanghai were insisting on such a zone.12.     He was informed in reply that the intention of paragraph 1 of the Japanese terms (paragraph 8 above) was to facilitate a voluntary withdrawal by the Chinese by a tern-porary suspension of the fighting in the existing position^ A real cessation of hostilities and the separation of the two forces were to have been the subject of the proposed conference.     Now that the Chinese had been compelled to retire it might be possible to enter on a conference.     The broad interpretation of the &quot;specified distance&quot; as meaning 20 kilometres was confirmed and the extent of the preliminary period of cessation of hostilities was to be agreed locally. The Japanese Government have no objection to the principle of reciprocity as regards guarantees of withdrawal, but consider it quite impossible to agree to a simultaneous evacuation.     The withdrawal and concentration of the Japanese forces (in the Shanghai and Woosung districts) are to be. carried out as soon as possible after the withdrawal of the Chinese forces shall have been confirmed.13,     As regards the question of a demilitarised zone the Japanese Minister was informed in effect that the Japanese Government have abandoned the idea of neutral zones round treaty ports, but not that of such a zone round Shanghai for which they mean to work at the Conference. They seem to expect the support of other Powers for the latter proposal, and even hope that one of the latter can , be induced to advance it.     Pending the findings of the round
Round. Table Conference the Japanese troops will remain generally in the Shanghai and Woosung area:   toe Japanese have, however, it is stated, not the slightest intention of permanently occupying the Woosung district.14.     Meanwhile the Chinese have explained to us that provided Japan also gives an assurance as to withdrawal they will discuss a truce or; the basis of Article 1 of the Japanese terms (paragraph 8 above) independently of the other articles. (This however is regarded by their spokesman in Shanghai as out of date in view of the Chinese retirement, which has take] them beyond the 20 kilometre line).     They will not enter a conference so long as the Japanese hold their existing mili-tary position and insist on the &quot;Kent&quot; terms for mutual one! simultaneous evacuation.     The agenda for a conference roust also be clearly specified beforehand.     Article 4 is regarded as one-sided.15.     The Chinese accept the proposals of the League Council (see paragraph 5) on condition of a cessation of hostilities on the basis described in paragraph 14.     Tbe Japanese have.accepted it without specific conditions.16.     The Japanese Minister admits that the Chinese are bound by nothing except the &quot;Kent&quot; terms.     He evidently regards them as properly binding on Japan also.     In view of this and of the apparent Japanese intention to insist at the conference on a demilitarised zone (notwithstanding M0 MatsudairaVs assurances) it is difficult to resist the conclusion that, while the Chinese are obstinate, the Japanese are not only obstinate but exorbitant, ambitious and deceitful and quite apart from their responsibility for the situation as a whole r.:.*o mo.in.ly responsible f Or the pr es ent imp as s e.17.     It is to our interest (notwithstanding the unwiseattitude
attitude of British members of the Shanghai Municipal Coun-cil to the contrary) to keep the scope of the proposed conference within narrow limits, and the United States Gov-ernment have sent very definite instructions to the same effect to the United States Minister in Shanghai;   What further can be said as to our immediate attitude?18.   The Japanese appear to be determined, and Sir F, Lindley thinks it will be impossible to move them,   un the other hand the Japanese delegate at Geneva accented (probability under great stress) the Assembly resolution on March 4th, which recommend negotiations for a definite cessation of hostilities and &quot;to regulate the withdrawal of the Japanese forces&quot;.   This con hardly be. construed as contemplating a wide scope for the conference and exorbi-tant conditions for a Japanese withdrawal, but the Japanese will no doubt say that it does not expressly limit the scope of the conference or exclude such conditions for with-drawal, so no hope is to be found in a policy waiting on the reception to be given to the resolution.19.   The Assembly will probably soon become impatient for resultss of which no prospect emerges from the fore-going survey, and we must decide what line we are to adopt if there is a continuance of the deadlock, in order to keep that impatience within bounds and avert the risk of action which may lead us to the brink of Article 16 of the Covenant.   The alternatives seem to be either to put pressure on Japan, which seems both useless and dangerous, or to adopt the argument that if the Chinese and Japanese ore unable to settle between them the terms for the propos-ed conference (which probably means a continuance of the deadlock -
deadlock - we hear that the Chinese are talking with apparent seriousness of withdrawing almost indefinitely if pressed) the questions with which the Conference was to deal must be investigated by the Lytton Commission,,20.   The terms of reference of the Lytton Commission are wide enough to justify the argumento   They are to &quot;study &quot;on the spot and report to the Council on any circumstance &quot;which, affecting international relations, threatens to dis-&quot;turb peace between China and Japan, or the good understand-&quot;ing between them upon which peace depends,&quot;   The Commission was appointed with reference to the Manchurian problem, but the terms of reference were so widely drawn at the request of the Japanese, in order that the boycott (which is the root of the Shanghai trouble) might be investigated by it.   The President declared, when the resolution was introduced, that &quot;each of the two Governments win have the right to request &quot;the Commission to consider any question the examination of &quot;which it part particularly desires.   The Commission will have &quot;full discretion to determine the questions upon which it &quot;will report to the Council,,&quot;2l0 The Commission was, of course, appointed by the Council when it was still dealing with the question under Article 11 of the Covenant, but there seems no reason why a report by it on the Shanghai side of the question should not be made, or at any rate made available, to the Assembly for the purpose of dealing with the dispute under Article 15.    Indfoed this result would seem to follow from the fact that the Shanghai side of the dispute at any rate has now been transferred to the Assembly in accordance with Article
15, and the Council is, therefore, no longer competent to deal with it under that article   In any case the Assembly could no doubt specifically request the Commission to make a report to it, if this formality were considered necessary^22,   The Commission&apos;s functions are only to investigate and report, and, though it may, of course, make proposals for a settlement of the dispute, it is for the body to which it reports to decide what action should be taken as to any such proposals*   The duty of the Assembly under Article 15 is in the first place to endeavour to effect a settlement of the dispute, and it is only if it is not so settled that a report has to be made in accordance with paragraph 4,   The Commission report would be mades in the first instance at any rate, with the object of assisting the Assembly to settle the dispute,  .* and it would be only after the report had been presented and efforts made by the Assembly on the basis of the report to settle the dispute had failed that the question of a report by the Assembly under paragraph 4 (with the further question of the effect o f a report adopted against the vote of one of the parties to the dispute) would arise.   A decision to await a report by the Lytton Commission should, therefore, have the effect of preventing the Assembly from proceeding immediately to draw up a report under Article 15, paragraph 4, and this should render it more difficult for an attempt to be made to press for the immediate application of Article 16,Foreign Office8th March, 1932 0
