Memorandum by the Home Secretary.TTie Cabinet at its meeting on the 16th December, 1931,   (Cabinet Conclusion 92(31)  Conclusion 9)  decided that the Home Secretary should prepare a Bill on the lines of Mr. dynes&apos;  Bill of 1931, as amended in Standing Committee, and that the Bill should be introduced as a Government measure but should not be supported by the Government Whip.In pursuance of that decision,  the attached Bill has been prepared by Parliamentary Counsel.      Subject to a few drafting amendments of minor importance,  the Bill is in identical terms with Mr. Clynes&apos;  Bill as amended in Committee.The Bill has been discussed with the Solicitor General who agrees that it is in proper form.      Both the Lord Chancellor and the Solicitor General, with whom I have been in consultation, have agreed that it is unnecessary to. summon a special meeting of the Home Affairs Committee to consider this single item.I  should be glad to have the approval of the Cabinet to the immediate introduction of the Bill, with a view to its being available for Second Reading should an opportunity offer soon after the Easter adjournment.     The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Home Department will be in charge of the Bill during its passage through Parliament.H. S .HOME OPE ICE:21st March,   1932.
