Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate to my colleagues a summary of the reports submitted to the Board of Trade Advisory Council on the state of trade in January.
For the first time since the improvement which followed the suspension of the gold standard, a decline in employment was reported.    During January the number of persons unemployed increased by 218,000 of whom 125,000 were wholly unemployed and 93,000 temporarily stopped;    this was in spite of a decrease of 55,000 in the numbers on the registers due to legislative changes.    The increase occurred in all districts but was greatest in London and the South and amongst men.    Some increase in unemployment is normal after Christmas but this January a number of industries not directly affected by the Christmas activity have suffered a decline in employment.The decrease in railway traffic receipts for January was larger than the comparatively low rate of decrease in December, the decline being 8,3$ in total receipts compared with 5.7$ in December and an average decline during 1931 of 8.4$.    The tonnage figures for freight traffic showed about the same decline.    That the general trade depression is the chief factor in this situation is proved by the fact that the largest decline Is in the heavier classes of goods in the carriage of which road transport is least competitive.There was an increase in unemployment in the coalmining industry during the month.    The unseasonable weather in January had an adverse effect on the domestic coal trade and abroad there was no slackening in the policy of restrictions notably in France, Germany, Belgium and Italy,  so that from both causes stocks of coal in this country tended to increase during the month.    Our exports of coal last year showed a decrease of 12,CO0,0CC tons on the previous year,  the largest declines being 2,400,000 tons to France, 1,600,000 tons to Scandinavia, 1,500,000 tons to Belgium and 1,3c1,C00 tons to Italy.    ForSTATE OF TRADE - JANUARY.  1932,(Summary of reports submitted to the Board of TradeAdvisory Council).
January 1932 exports were 3,313,000 tons only as compared with 3,271,000 in January 1931, although the latter was abnormally low,  through the effect of strike conditions in South Y/ales0 There was however an increase in the production of coke in South Wales consequent on the starting up of some iron and steel workSoThere was a decline in employment in the iron and steel industry during January.    There was a slightly improved tone during the first half of the month hut the activity was less than is expected after the holidays.    The number of furnaces in blast increased by six and the production of both pig Iron and steel ingots was slightly up compared with December,    Imports for January after the heavy figures for the last few months were substantially down;   exports also showed a reduction as compared with December but were higher than the average monthly figure for 1931.    Most districts continue to work at 25 to 30 per cent, of capacity hut there was a little improvement in tinplates in South Wales and british producers obtained a larger share of orders for semi-finished steel0    There is now relatively little foreign importation of pig iron but a good deal is coming in from India, especially to Scotland.    There was no change in the prices of finished steel and though there was a good deal of enquiry from abroad very little business was done except,  owing to the British Steel Export Association, to Canada,The shipbuilding industry remained at a very low ebb and only one order of consequence was placed during the month. There was a small reduction in the figures of laid-up tonnage and there appears to be some improvement in shipping business outwards, but the freight position remained fairly stationary and the Argentine continued to dominate the chartering position homewards at rates only a little better than is necessary to keep steamers from being laid up,
Employment declined in &quot;both general and electrical engineering.    Contracts placed during the month included, besides orders for railway material for foreign countries, an order valued at 5350,000 for electrical plant for India, a contract of about  240,000 for a new bridge over the Forth and orders secured from, or in competition with, America,    The report from the electrical industry showed that the position was not so good as at the sane time last year:    there appears to be a general, but,  it ie thought, temporary,  &quot;hold up&quot; of trade in both home and export markets and until this improves full advantage cannot be obtained either from the import duties in the home market or from the exchange situation in markets abroad.    The representative of the electrical industry stated that reductions will be made forthwith in the price of articles covered by the duties under the Abnormal Importations Act in the hope that these will continue &apos;in some reasonable shape&apos;.The general fall in the demand for motor cars in the home market continues, but steady progress is being made in exports,  and the export of trucks and light cars last month was slightly higher than in January, 1931,  i0e. in number; values are much less over that period.    It is evident, however,  that American companies are now preparing to compete with the British small car in markets abroad,  a part of the trade which has hitherto been a British preserve, and the opinion was expressed that the basis of motor taxation in this country should be reviewed.There was a further increase in unemployment in the building industry,  the total numbers unemployed at the end of January being 280,000 or,  if public works contracting is included, 380,000.   As a result of the depression in the trade, the demand for building material is low and stocks of bricks are stated to be very high.-3-t PfflfflttrmiffliMmiHiTwiu nmut iiwwiitiiiiwHH i m\ hi mm i\\ iihwi . i&apos; i if in if mni&apos; hwi 11 w i n Bum i m ihm mmi i iini miirmiim&apos;Mi tn i-1 iwnnwiini i imim im wrriiiTBigiTinnmrrMfMiiBMianiMiii m bui i umt iMiiaimfwiwiBBmwwwwHriwiiiiMi iiimi i w imnr 11 wirnnnaw miimh n i niMn i iihiibim m 111 n iibbb soumise iibi w ibmh
There was a decline in employment in the cotton industry during; January.    The general position makes buyers unwilling to place more than small orders and the disturbances in China have put an end to inquiries there, though shipments are still being made.    There has been some improvement in general prospects in India, apart from Bombay, and more Inquiries, but Japanese competition is&apos; being felt very severely, especially in Ceylon.Employment also declined in January in the woollen and worsted industry, but generally speaking the improvement of the last few months has been maintained,  especially in women&apos;s dress goods, and, while there is a good deal of   . unemployment, there is also a fair amount of overtime. Imports of yarns and piece goods in January fell off very greatly compared with the last few months and exports of both yarns and piece goods rose from December&apos;s figures; exports of wool tops and worsted yarns were above the figures for January last year, but the total value of the woollen and worsted export trade was considerably less.The report from the hosiery industry was not so good as in the last few months, though the position appears on the whole to be better than at the same time last year. Imports have been very greatly reduced,  the figures for January being  518,CCO, practically  1,000,000 less than for January,  1931.    There are still, however, large stocks of foreign goods in the country.    Exports showed some improvc-ment as compared with December and in the case of several kinds of hosiery were above the figures for January last year in quantity, but values were much lower than a year ago.As regards other industries,  the report from the chemical Industry, while not so good as in December,  is distinctly satisfactory compared with last year.    There was little change in the rubber industry,  the demand for tyres being
about the same as last year.    Japanese competition is complained of In rubber boots and shoes on the home market and especially in export markets.    The boot and shoe industry is slack at present, but there are indications of improvement and &apos; some of the larger and better run factories appear to be fairly fully employed.Russia is not shipping much wheat to this country now and is expected to be a less serious competitor in this market until, next September.    The Australian wheat crop was larger than at first expected; increasing shipments are being made to the East and especially China.    Canada and the United States are both trying to keep the price up above the quotations from Australia and the Argentine.   The Argentine crop is estimated to provide an exportable surplus of 3,000,000 tons which may be compared with an actual shipment of 3,567,000 tons during 1931,The money value of retail sales, compared with the same month of the previous year, showed a decline of 5.2$ in December and 5.6$ in January. Special mention was made of -the remarkable response which has been made to the &quot;Buy British&quot; campaign. The co-operative wholesale societies again report Increases in quantities sold and the English Society reports an increase in the total value of sales as well.The chief features of the money market during the month were the plethora of money, in spite of income tax payments, and the stability of sterling.    The European financial situation became worse rather than better and exchange restrictions tended to increase.The figures of Indian trade for the last year show that there was a reduction of 30$ in the total trade, 20$ of which is attributable to the fall in prices.    On the other hand, India&apos;s favourable trade balance rose from 333,000,000 to  45,000,000, due entirely to recent large exports of gold from all parts of India, which appear to be caused by a conviction
that the present price of gold will not last.    The production of Indian cotton mills is increasing very considerably and the latest figures show that 30 Bombay mills are working night and day.Good prices were obtained at the Australian wool sales in January,  the demand being especially strong from Japan and from the Continent.   Australia&apos;s trade with the East is on the increase;    in the year 1930-31 the total value of this trade was 519,300,000,  a rise of  1,800,000, compared with the previous year,  the chief items of export being wheat and wool.The financial difficulties of the South American countries continue and no substantial Improvement can be looked for at present.    It is extremely difficult to get money out of any of these countries and in some cases control of exchange is rendering business almost impossible. The British-owned railways and public utility companies have been obliged to reduce their purchases in this country and elsewhere to a minimum.    The outlook for British interests in the Argentine appears, however,  to be comparatively hopeful:    for the first eleven months of last year the imports Into the Argentine showed a decrease of 30$, but it is believed that of this reduced trade British exporters certainly retained their share and probably even made some headway against other countries.
