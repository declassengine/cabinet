o 0Til IS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY? S GCRTERNMENT.SECRET. COPY NO. . /?----C.P.57 (32).CABIN E T.ADMISSION OF FOREIGN MUSICIANS AND OTHERS FOR EMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY.Note by the Minister of Labour.l-jr In view of recent discussions in the Press, I am circulating for information this note on the present practice of the Ministry of Labour in issuing permits to employers In this country for the engagement of foreigners in the entertainments &quot;industry&quot;.It will be seen that it is a complete mistake to suppose that there has been any drastic change of policy under the present Government,  or that anything like a &quot;ban&quot; upon foreign musicians has been imposed.2.      Article l(3)(&quot;b)  of the Aliens Order,  1920 (under which a Ministry of Labour permit is required before any foreigner can be brought into this country for employment) was no doubt intended to deal mainly with industrial workers.      In applj^ing it to musicians actcrsj  theatre end music-hall &quot;turns&quot;, hands,  etc. the governing considerations have been;-(a) Interchange of foreign end British &quot;talent&quot; is desirable on general grounds and necessary for commercial reasons;(b) Foreigners who have something distinctive and of value to contribute should be admitted freely, with proper safeguards;(c) Foreigners who are merely competing with British workers and have nothing distinctive to contribute should be excluded,  especially if they are likely to undercut standard rates and conditions.Permits are issued for a limited period but are extended freely, if good reason is shown.a-
3.     Musi c--h.a.3.1 and _ cabs ret &quot;tamo;1,,, variety artists, / etc .It is generally agreed that for the salve of variety it is necessary to include an appreciable foreign element in music-hall and cabaret programmes.     A manager who applies for a permit has to show that in general he is employing a substantial proportion of British labour,  and that the particular &quot;turn&quot; In question, is distinctive or novel or cannot be obtained in this country (e.g.  almost all acrobats are foreigners;    most tight rope performers are Mexicans).      The system is well understood by the interests concerned and works quite smoothly. It was discussed on January 21st, 1032, with representatives of the agents, managers,  and the Variety Artists Federation, who expressed themselves as &quot;fully satisfied&quot; with the present arrangements-     British variety artists obtain many engagements abroad, end their representatives said that the newspaper &quot;stunt&quot; about a British &quot;ban&quot; on foreigners was prejudicing their interests.In the 3 months ended December, 1930, permits were issued for 630 foreigners of this class and were refused for 27 (8 turns). In the 3 months ended December, 1931, permits were issued for 560 and refused for 27 (8 turns). 4.      Actors.The same system is applied to actors.     Actors of first-rate standing are admitted freely..      Those of lesser rani: are. also admitted for definite engagements,  if there is some special reason,  e.g. that an American is required for a particular part.(The recent &quot;alarum&quot; about Miss Susan Glaspell, the American novelist, was baseless.     A manager who was producing a play of hers applied to the Hone Office for a permit to employ her as an actress.     They referred the case in the usual way to the Ministry of Labour, who asked the Manager for the usual
information au to period or engagement,  salary,  and the rescons for engaging   Miss Glaspell (who is not an actress).     T^o days after, &quot;before he had replied, the press announced that the Home Office had refused a permit.      The Ministry asked the Manager for an explanation and he said that he had telephoned to the Hone Office and had &quot;been told that he could not hare a permit.     The Home Office had no record of the call and had not decided on or notified refusal.      In fact consent was given the next day, &quot;but Miss Glaspell apparent3.y does not now wish to act.-     The incident may have served to advertise the play). 5a      Concert music!ens-,  quartets and orchestras.Up to October last permits were issued freely for foreigners in  this category.     A deputation consisting of leading people in the musical world represented that there was severe hardship among British professional musicians,  and that they were suffering from the unregulated admission of foreigners *     Accordingly some increased restriction was imposed.     The deputation gave wide publicity to the question and.,an aorimonious correspondence ensued In the Press, which bore little relation to the facts.     Prom October to January out of about 130 applications for permits only 9 were refused.      It was not easy at first to arrive at a generally acceptable working rule, but early in January a meeting fully representative of orchestral and choral societies, agents,  concert halls,  the B.B.C.  and the Incorporated Society of Musicians agreed on the following arrangements.     Plrst-rate performers of inter--national standing (whether individuals,  ensembles or orchestras) are admitted freely,     Permits are also issued for performers of lesser standing with regard to whom a claim can be established that they can contribute &quot;something new,  distinctive or original in the way of musical performance or interpretation&quot;.     Permits are as a rule refused to performers for whom such a claim cannot be established.
The Rinternet ionals* of course are well-known.    For the others,  the Ministry of Labour obviously cannot by itself decide on the merits of an individual artisto    The procedure is to obtain from the agent or other person who wishes to engage a foreigner a statement of his reasons (e,g, a record of performances, press notices,  etc.)e    If any body,  such as the Incorporated Society of Musicians,  objects,  they are asked for a counter-statement.      If the decision is still in doubt, the Ministry consult privately one or more of three individuals of standing in the musical world.    They prefer that their names should not be given, but they are independent persons of recognised authority, knowledge and judgment.6.      Bands (other than concert orchejstras).For some time permits have not been issued for foreign dance bands, it being generally agreed that the home supply is adequate in quality and quantity. An exception (for short engagements) is made for bands of international reputation,  such as Paul Whitoman&apos;s.Bands are admitted for music-halls,    if they are something distinctive (e. g.  the French jazz-band, and Alt red Rode&apos;s band now in the country).The question of foreign bands for restaurants has caused much difficulty in the past, and my predecessor finally adopted, a policy of complete exclusion, which was hailed with relief by the restaurant proprietors on the understanding that it was applied all round.    The only exceptions made were in favour of a tzigane band at the Hungeria Restaurant, which was backed by the Hungarian Government, and, because they were allowed to remain,  a tsigane band at Olaridge1s.    Both these permits expire at the end of January.    There have been protests against the departure of the Hungaria band, but a compromise has now been arranged and the liquidators of the restaurant have applied for permission to retain a portion of the gypsy band on the terms that they train
English musicians in this particular form, of entertainment.    I have intimated that I am quite willing to grant a permit on these termso    This arrangement will9 I hope, be satisfactory to all parties cone erned07.      It will be seen that,   -part from the restriction in the case of concert musicians, no change at all has been made from the policy of the late Government in regard to the admission of foreign artists for purposes of entertainment.8.      There has been no change in any other sphere, except in regard to foreign domestic servants.    There has for some months been a much larger number of trained domestic servants available in this country, and employers who wish to bring in a foreigner are new pressed more strongly than before to show that they have made serious attempts to meet their requirements -&amp;ens* the home supply.    The number of permits issued was from January to September 3y942 in 1930 and 43992 in 1931,  and from October to December 1,639 in 193C and 1,180 in 1931, I.e0 there has been a reduction of about 30$ as compared with 1930 since the restriction b egan to oper ats.90      It may be of Interest to add that since last September there has been a large increase in the number of foreign firms applying for permits for foreign workmen to help in establishing factories in this country.    It is the practice to treat them liberally, subject to the fulfilment of the usual conditions as to the training of British labour.    Care is being taken,  in consultation with the Chief Industrial Adviser&apos;s Department, Board of Trade,  to see that facilities are not extended to firms who would be merely competitive with established British undertakings.(Iritld.)    H,B.29th January,  1932.
