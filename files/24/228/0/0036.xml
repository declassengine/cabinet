this document is the property op his britannic majestvs government Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1932.     . secret. Copy No.     g.CP. 86 (32).CABINET.IRISH FREE STATE : POLITICAL SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Mr. de VALERA&apos;S Election programme (Appendix A), while indicating that he intended to proceed on constitutional lines, foreshadowed early action in two matters likely to provoke controversy with the Government here : (a) The abolition of the provision in the Irish Free State Constitution as tothe Oath to be taken by Members of the Dail before taking their seats (see 1 in the programme);(b) The retention by the Irish Free State Government of the Land PurchaseAnnuities payable by persons in the Irish Free State (see 2 in the programme).It is, of course, possible that other action may be taken by Mr. de Valera resulting in controversy with the Government here and I shall keep a careful watch on the situation and bring to the notice of my colleagues any steps of this nature, but in the first place I do not think that it is necessary for us to do more than consider the two matters mentioned above. This memorandum is, accordingly, only intended as a preliminary survey of those two questions, and I realize that difficult legal questions are involved. As to these, reference will of course be made to the Law Officers, as and when necessary.(A) Abolition of the Oath.2. In the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty of the 6th December, 1921 (which for brevity I shall call &quot; the Treaty &quot; in this memorandum), provision is made for the Oath in the following terms (Article 4) : &quot; 4. The oath to be taken by Members of the Parliament of the Irish Free State shall be in the following form : I......do solemnly swear true faith and allegiance to the Consti-tution of the Irish Free State as by law established, and that I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his heirs and successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot;Article 17 of the Irish Free State Constitution provides as follows :-Article 17.&quot; The oath to be taken by members of the Oireachtas shall be in the following form : I......do solemnly swear true faith and allegiance to the Consti-tution of the Irish Free State as by law established, and that I will be[6647] b
faithful to His Majesty King George V, his heirs and successors by la\vf* in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.Such oath shall be taken and subscribed by every member of the Oireachtas before taking his seat therein before the Representative of the Crown or some person authorised by him.&quot;3. It would seem that Mr. de Valera&apos;s intention is, while leaving intact the first paragraph of Article 17 of the Constitution which reproduces Article 4 of the Treaty, to repeal the second paragraph of Article 17, which does not appear in the Treaty. His contention is that the form in which Article 4 of the Treaty was drafted does no more than provide a form of Oath and leaves it open to the Free State Parliament to make the taking of the Oath optional or to grant exemptions therefrom.4. In 1922 considerable discussion took place over the form of the Irish Free State Constitution. The original draft of the Constitution, as prepared in the Irish Free State (a secret document which was never published), contained no reference to the Oath. The draft was open to serious objections in other respects, and the then Prime Minister (Mr. Lloyd George) felt it necessary to write a strongly worded letter to the Head of the Provisional Government (Mr. Arthur Griffith) calling attention to these objections and putting a series of questions, of which No. 5 was as follows :  &apos;&apos; Is the Oath set forth in the Treaty to be incorporated in the Constitution as the Oath required of Members of the Free State Parliament?&quot;Mr. Griffiths reply contained the following paragraph : &quot; Your fifth question .... does not present any difficulty. If your Government is not satisfied that the Oath is sufficiently incorporated in the Constitution by the fact that the Constitution will enact the Treaty as law, the Oath will be expressly set forth in the Constitution as the Oath required of the Members of Parliament.&quot;5. When the text of the Constitution was being discussed in the Provisional Parliament in Dublin an amendment was moved (by Mr. Gavan Duffy, one of the signatories of the Articles of Agreement) to omit the second paragraph of Article 17 and this amendment w7as supported by argument on the lines of paragraph 3 of tills memorandum. The amendment was resisted by Mr. Kevin OTIiggins (at that time Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s chief lieutenant) on the footing that the form of the Oath represented a concession to Irish opinion from the standard form of Oath adopted in Dominion Constitutions generally and that it was certainly the intention of the parties to the Agreement that the Oath should be compulsory as in the case of other Dominion Constitutions.6. I have no doubt that my colleagues will agree that we must adhere to the view that the taking of the Oath is compulsory. In this connection I would observe that Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty, which refer to the general constitutional position of the Irish Free State and in particular to the relationship of the Crown to the Irish Free State by analogy to that of Canada, might well be held to require the taking of an Oath by Members of the Irish Free State Parliament before taking their seats in the same manner as Members of both Houses of the Parliament of Canada (see section 128 of the British North America Act, 1867); on this basis Article 4 of the Treaty would not affect the compulsory character of the Oath but would only provide for a special form of Oath.7. It will be recalled that it was not until 1927 that Mr. de Valera and his party took their seats in the Irish Free State Parliament. The proceedings of the Dail record a certificate by the Clerk that they &quot; complied with Article 17 &quot; of the Constitution (i.e., the Article relating to the Oath). Since then statements have been made from time to time by members of that party to the effect that they had &quot; taken no oath.&quot;   Mr. de Valera, in an interview last December,
referring to the action of the Fianna Fail Senators returned in the recent senatorial election, which he said followed the practice initiated by the Fianna Fail party when it first entered the Bail, stated as follows : &quot; The Party made it clear that no oath, or substitute for an oath, was being taken, both by a public statement made in advance and by a statement made to the official in charge by each individual before signing. The statement provided for each Senator was in the following terms : &quot; &apos; I want you to understand that I am not taking any oath, nor giving any promise of faithfulness to the King of England, or to any power outside the people of Ireland.&quot;&apos; I am putting my name here merely as a formality to get the permission necessary to enter amongst the other Senators elected by the people of Ireland, and I want you to know that no other meaning is to be attached to what I am doing.&apos; &quot;8. The question for consideration is what action should be taken by the Government here. On this point it must be remembered that, on the assumption that Mr. de Valera will proceed in a &quot; constitutional &quot; manner (i.e., will not at once declare a revolutionary republic), he and his followers must, as a first step in order to take their seats, &quot;comply with Article 17 of the Constitution,&quot; i.e., they will presumably act in the manner described in paragraph 7 above. He would then presumably proceed to introduce a Bill for the amendment of the Constitution, by the omission of the second paragraph of Article 17. Assuming that the Labour Party were prepared to support him in this, and that the Bill passed the Dail, the Senate (in which at present Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s supporters, including Independents, hold over 40 out of the 60 seats), would probably reject it. Under the provisions of the Irish Free State Constitution for avoiding a deadlock (see Article 38a) this would involve a delay of 18 months from the day on -which the Bill was sent to the Senate before it could be resubmitted. It could then be passed into law after a further two months notwithstanding the Senate&apos;s rejection of it.9. If, therefore, the jDroceedings follow constitutional lines, it looks as though some time will elapse before it is absolutely necessary for the Government here to define its attitude on this particular issue. On the other hand, there would, no doubt, be pressure in Parliament for a statement. While I think that we should be justified in refusing to make any statement on hypothetical cases, we must be prepared to define our attitude, as soon as a Bill is introduced into the Irish Free State Parliament. It is therefore desirable that we should now take a decision as to the general lines of our policy.10.   The position, as I see it, is as follows :-(1) As a matter of general policy, if the Irish Free State is to attempt to break away from the British Commonwealth, it is vitally important that it should be clear that this is entirely the responsibility of the Irish Free State; in other words we must not take action which would enable Mr. de Valera to say that we were forcing him out of the British Commonwealth. This is the general principle which should guide us in all matters of controversy with him.(2) We must take our stand on the Treaty of 1921. This is essential in justice not only to this country, but also to those in the Irish Free State who, through ten difficult years, have shown their determination to uphold the Treaty.(3) We must remember that the present position is quite different from that of 1921. At that time the great bulk of the population of what is now the Irish Free State were bitterly hostile to this country. Now one of the two big parties in the Irish Free State is absolutely pledged to the maintenance of the British connection as embodied in the Treaty.(4) We must take the view that the compulsory taking of the Oath is an essential part of the Settlement of 1921, and that the abolition of the provision in the Irish Free State Constitution on this point would in consequence be a breach of that settlement. Accordingly, as soon as a Bill is introduced in the Irish Free State Parliament, we ought to [6647] . u 2 &quot;
CS 4make it absolutely clear in Parliament here that we regard this point as an essential part of the Treaty; at the same time we, should say that we reserve complete freedom of action if the Bill becomes law.* (5) On the assumption that we have made our position clear as proposed above, and that Mr. de Valera still proceeds with the Bill, I suggest that our best course would probably be to take no further action at any rate until the Bill is on the point of becoming law. As indicated above, a considerable period would probably lapse before this situation arose; moreover, even when the Bill has become law, it would seem possible that its validity of the ground of repugnancy to the Treaty would be challenged in the Irish Free Courts. The Irish Free State Constituent Act provides that any provisions of the original Constitution or its amendments repugnant to the Treaty are void and inoperative to the extent of such repugnancy, and under the Constitution the powers of the Courts include the question of &quot; the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.&quot;(6) If and when the Bill becomes law, the question of the application of &quot; sanctions &quot; will arise. As this question may also arise in connection with the annuities, I will deal with it in a later part of this memorandum.(B) Retention of Land Annuities.11. I understand that this question, with other questions of financial relations between the two Governments, is being examined in the Treasury, but my colleagues may like to have a brief account of the point at issue.12: The annuities are those payable by tenants in the Irish Free State area in respect of lands purchased under the Land Purchase Acts of 1891, 1903 and 1909. The vendor landlords were paid either in stock or in cash raised by the issue of such stock, and the stock was guaranteed by the British Government as to interest in the case of all three Acts, and as to principal also in the case of the Act of 1891. The system of land purchase in Ireland was merely the machinery set up by Government to make it easy for the tenant to pay on the instalment system for the land which he had bought, and in essence, the annuities are the private debts of the tenant purchasers to the landlords or to those to whom the latter sold any stock issued to them. They are at the same time the primary source of the funds required for the service of the land stocks, and are thus the asset on which the British Government relied in guaranteeing those stocks.13. The Treaty does not refer to the Land Purchase Annuities; but it was throughout understood between; the two parties to the Treaty that the annuities should continue to be available for the service of the land stocks. It was explicitly provided in the financial agreements of 1923 and 1926 that the Irish Free State Government should continue to collect the annuities and pay them over to the Fund out of which the interest and sinking fund on the stock are payable.14. The arguments which have hitherto been put forward by Mr. de Valera in domestic controversy in Ireland in support of the claim that the annuities should be retained by the Irish Free State exchequer, have been entirely legal, and are directed to attempting to show that the retention of the annuities is not inconsistent with the terms of the Treaty.15. These legal arguments have been traversed in a full memorandum by the Irish Free State Attorney-General published by the Cosgrave Government in December of last j^ear. Mr. de Valera has made no attempt to deal with the equities and the underlying facts of the situation which, as stated above, are that the annuities represent the repayment to individuals by Irish tenants of the money lent for the purchase of- their holdings.,. * Note. - It may perhaps be,jthat the abolition of the Oath, if carried into effect unaccompanied by any formal repudiation of. allegiance, could hardly be regarded by itself as constituting a breach of allegiance or sin act of secession, but this obviously is a legal question of first-class importance on which it would bd necexsary to consult the. l/uw Officers.    - v. ,  ,
16. If Mr. de Valera proceeds with his intention to retain the annuities, various courses are open to him :-   -(1) He may begin by negotiation with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and, possibly, suggest to them that the question should be referred to arbitration.(2) He may proceed to introduce legislation in the Irish Free State Parliament to repeal Section 12 of the Irish Free State Land Act, 1923, which provides for the annuity payments being handed over. This procedure will presumably take time, even if the Bill were classed as a Money Bill, the effect of which would be that the Irish Free State Senate could not long delay its passage.(3) He may, in addition to, or without, taking either of the above courses, simply withhold the half-yearly payment due at the end of June 1932.17. As regards methods of dealing with the possible situation which may arise, I think that as a first step we should, clS SOOlx clS Mr. de Valera takes overt action which must be interpreted as a refusal to pay, make clear our view that we regard ourselves as having a valid claim to payment. Further action would depend upon the course pursued by Mr. de Valera, but this question stands in an entirely different category to that of the Oath, and I feel that its nature is such and that our case is so strong that we ought to consider whether it would be desirable to accept reference to arbitration if offered by Mr. de Valera, or even alternatively to propose it. In the event of arbitration, we should, of course, insist on arbitration by a tribunal constituted from within the British Commonwealth such as was recommended by the Imperial Conference of 1930. If Mr. de Valera persisted in withholding the annuities, the question of the application of sanctions would arise.(C) Sanctions.18. There are two possible classes of sanctions which could be considered : (a) political and (b) economic.Political sanctions would include (l) The denial to Irish Free State citizens in this country and the Coloniesof the privileges accorded to British subjects, (ii) The denial to the Irish Free State Government of the facilities at presentafforded to them in connection with the conduct of foreign affairs.The first category of political sanctions would involve such matters as the requirement of passports by travellers from the Irish Free State to this country, restrictions on the employment of Irish Free State citizens, the enforcement of registration with the police, and the liability to deportation. It would, in present circumstances, require special legislation involving discrimination against a particular class of British subject; and there would be certain questions of administrative difficulty and expense to be considered. Further, there can be no doubt that the position of Northern Ireland, would add considerably to the difficulty of applying any sanction of this kind.The second category of political sanctions would not appear to present any administrative difficulty from our point of view, though its effect on the inter-national situation would, of course, have to be carefully considered. On the other hand, though it might involve some inconvenience to the Irish Free State Govern-ment. at any rate in the early stages, it would not be likely to cause serious embarrassment to them.19. Economic sanctions might take various forms. The most obvious would be to deny to Irish Free State goods the benefit of Imperial preference. For example, refusal to pay the annuities in June, might be countered by a refusal on our part to negotiate with the Irish Free State at Ottawa with a view to an agreement of the kind contemplated in Clause 4 of the Import Duties Bill, thus leaving the 10 per cent, tariff and any additional duties to come into force against Irish Free State goods automatically in November. If more stringent action were necessary a special levy on Irish Free State goods migh have to be considered, e.g., h special import tax on live-stock which forms the most important branch of their export trade to. this country. But the whole of this question requires careful and detailed examination, from the point of view not only of the
immediate effect of such measures on the trade both of this country and of the Irish Free State, but also the effect of possible reprisals on the part of the Irish Free State. Further, it would be necessary to consider under this head the position as regards the various other financial arrangements between the two countries, e.g., the arrangement as to double income tax and the fact that the Irish Free State Government under existing arrangements at present make the following annual payments to us :  600,000 towards the Local Loans Fund,  1,100,000 in respect of R.I.C. pensions and  250,000 on account of compensation for damage.20. I think that it would be desirable that arrangements should be made for the careful study of the question of the land annuities and also of the effect of the various possible forms of sanction to be further pursued in detail by a Committee of the Cabinet.(D) Summary.21.   I might sum up the position as follows : (I) Time is on our side. The Eucharistic Congress meets in Dublin in the summer, and it is likely that there would be a general desire to avoid any serious political controversy in the Free State, at any rate until the close of the Congress. It looks as though Mr. de Valera will only be able to command a majority in the Dail with the aid of the small party of Labour Members, who, while they may support him on the question of the Oath, are, in general, committed to adherence to the Treaty. In the Senate, Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s supporters command an over-whelming majority and will be able, if they wish, to hold up legis-lation on the Oath (though possibly not on the annuities) for at any rate 18 months. If legislation on the Oath is eventually passed, its validity might be challenged in the Free State courts. Our tariff policy may also, as time goes on, have its effect on the minds of the farming community. (II) We must allow the first move to come from Mr. de Valera, and there should be no provocative action on our part. But as soon as Mr. de Valera takes action, we must define our attitude.(III) On the question of the Oath, our attitude should be that we regard it as an integral part of the Treaty.(IV) On the question of the annuities, we should make it clear that we consider that we have an entirely valid claim to payment, but we should examine whether it would be desirable either to accept or to offer arbitration before a British Commonwealth Tribunal.(V) We should also investigate further in the meantime the question of sanctions and their effects. (VI) Lastly, in our own interests and also in loyalty to others, namely, those who, like Mr. Kevin 0&apos;Higgins, have given their lives for the Treaty, and those who, like Mr. Cosgrave, have risked, and are still risking, their lives and political fortunes for it, we should stand absolutely by the sanctity of the Treaty. On this there can be ho compromise : our attitude should be clear and definite.J. LI. T.Dominions Office, February 1932.
APPENDIX AExtract from &quot;Irish Independent.&quot; To the Electors !Fianna Fail seeks a Mandate to proceed with the following Items included in its programme.1. TO remove the Article of the Constitution which makes the signing of the Oath of Allegiance obligatory on members entering the Dail.This Article is not required by the Treaty. It stands in the way of national unity and of willing obedience to law.   Government by coercion is the result.2.   To retain the Land Annuities in the State Treasury.There is no contractual obligation binding us to hand these Annuities over to Britain. The British Government is neither legally nor justly entitled to receive them. This is the signed and published opinion of several prominent lawyers.With two of the three million pounds involved the farmers can be relieved completely of the rates on their holdings. iVnother million is available for the relief of taxation, or for such purposes as the Dail may determine.3. To submit to Counsel for their opinion the question of the obligation to make the other annual pajrments to Britain, including the pensions of the former R.I.C. and to act on the opinion obtained.These payments added to the Land Annuity payments impose on the Irish People a burden relatively heavier than the burden imposed on the German people by the War Reparation Payments. The continuance of these payments would make economic recovery almost impossible.4. To organise systematically the establishment of the industries required to meet the needs of the community in manufactured goods.The aim would be to make ourselves as independent of foreign imports as possible and to provide for our people the employment that is at present denied them. Suitable fiscal laws would be passed to give the protection necessary against unfair foreign competition.5. To preserve the home market for our farmers and to encourage the production by them of our food requirements to the greatest extent possible.6. To negotiate trade agreements that would secure for our products preferences in foreign markets, always subject to the condition that the protection required for the maintenance and development of our own agricultural and manufacturing industries will not be lessened.The people of Britain and ourselves are each the others&apos; best customer. Our g-eographical position, and other factors, make it unlikely that this close trade relationship will rapidly change. Machinery and other capital equipment for our industries will have to be purchased from abroad. We can in these purchases accord a preference to Britain in return for a preference in her markets for our agricultural produce.7. To take the necessary powers to eliminate waste and extravagance in public administration. To scale down the higher salaries till they are more in keeping with the means of the taxpayer and the frugal living that all sections of the community must be content with, until everyone who is able and willing to work is given a fair opportunity .to earn his daily bread.We do not propose to seek economies by restricting the social services or by cutting down the salaries of the middle and lower grades of the Civil Service. These salaries are in most cases barely sufficient to meet the costs of the maintenance of a home and the support and education of children.We are prepared to institute an enquiry into the basis on which the cost of living figure is calculated and to establish an Arbitration Board to deal with the grievances of the Service. We are prepared also to consider sympathetically the claim that the avenues of promotion recently closed to certain branches of the Service should be reopened.
8. To endeavour by systematic effort to preserve the Irish language and make it again the spoken language of the people; to save the native speaker from the emigrant ship, to provide employment for him in the Gaeltacht, and make it possible for the language to spread out naturally from the Gaeltacht to the surrounding area.We pledge ourselves that, if elected in a majority, we shall not in the field of international relations exceed the mandate here asked for without again consulting the people.We shall, however, never cease to protest against the iniquity of the partition of our country ruthlessly cut in two against the wishes of the people, and shall by every peaceful means strive to bring it to an end.We shall strive also to bring British statesmen to realize that the interests of Britain, as well as the interests of Ireland, are best secured by an understanding and settlement which will permit the people of the two islands to live side by side as independent friendly neighbours each respecting the rights of the other and co-operating freely in matters of common concern.   We pledge ourselves further not to use our majority to pursue a vindictive course against any minority, but to govern fairly in the interests of all sections of the community.   All citizens will be treated as equal before the law and the individual will be protected in his person, and in his property, with all the resources at the Government&apos;s command. ...... Ordinarily such promises would not be necessary.   Apprehensions, however,have been aroused, and it is necessary to allay them. We may add that we have no leaning towards Communism and no belief in Communistic doctrines. We believe in the diffusion of property and ownership and are convinced that this would lead to much more satisfactory social conditions and to a much higher life for the individual.We believe in decentralisation of government, in leaving to the local authorities as much power as possible. We believe also in the ruralisation of industry, not in its concentration in large cities. A Land Tax is no part of our programme, and the farmer&apos;s title to his holding can in no way be endangered by the retention of the Land Annuities.We ask the electors not to allow themselves to be deceived by the misrepresented-sentations of our opponents, and we pledge ourselves not to abuse their confidence.February 9, 1932.EAMON de VALERA.
