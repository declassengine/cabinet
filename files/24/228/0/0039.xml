COPY NO.9(52).0 A B I IT E^,T ^1*  THE DISARMflAJSNT OOHEERMQB. 2.  THE SITUATION IN THE P.AR EAST.Probeedings at Geneva, Memorandum by the Seere tary.of State for.Foreign Affairs.My colleagues may be glad to have a short connected account of transactions at Geneva in which the U.k1  representatives have been taking part since I returned there, arriving on Wednesday morning, February 24th.      The First Lord joined me next day0      I deal with these matters under two heads,  the Disarmament Conference and the situation in the Far East.1.    The Disarmament Conference,,My reason for leaving London when I did was that M.   de Pleuriau told me that lia Tardieu would be in Geneva the next day and that he wished me to agree that the German proposals put before the -Disarmament Conference were so much opposed to the scheme of the Draft Disarmament Convention that they, as well as M. Libvinoff!s proposal for complete disarmament,  should be treated as contre-pro jets and disposed of first.      I saw M,  Tardieu on arrival and had a long talk with him,,      He had wavered somewhat in the interval and in the end he agreed with xae that the German proposal could be fitted within the framework of the Draft Disarmament Convention if suitable amendments were carried,  so that only M, Litvinoff&apos;s ex-extreme proposition remained outstanding.      Before the meeting of the General Commission in the afternoon of Wednesday,  the agreement of the other Great Powers was secured and the U0K0  representative proposed a resolution that the work of the Conference should pro-ceed &quot;within the framework of the Draft Disarmament Convention&quot;,, M0 Tardieu seconded this and it was ultimately carried unanimously. M. Litvinoff&apos;s beguiling but impracticable /r- 1 -OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC M-WESTY^S GOVEPJT1DSNT).
alternative being first defeated by some 60 votes to L    The result is that a first clash between the German and French positions was avoided and this has undoxibtedly contributed to a feeling of reasonable give-and-take which has shown itself in the Conference discussions.At the same time, very little progress has been made in the interval, except that a series of Committees have been set up, subordinate to the Commission Gencrale, which will deal with (1)  Land armaments j    (2) Naval armaments(3) Air armaments, (4) Limitations of expenditure and (5) Political questions. Those sub-committees will report to the Commission Generale and the latter, after further discussion, will report to the main Conference.    The intention is that the special sub-committees will be Standing Committees ready    to deal with the technical aspects of various questions, while the General Commission will maintain control over broader aspects of principle..    There was a long discussion as to whether a Political sub-committee should be established and I expressed some doubts about it, but finding that the French and German views were likely to become,opposed I appealed to the German representative to agree on this point of procedure and he was loudly cheered for doing so. Mo Tardieu expressed himself as much gratified at the help we had given in the matter and I have had several long conversations with Herr Nodolny which show that the Germans are also looking to us to find a via media,So far, so good;    but the Cabinet ought clearly to realise that up to the present the discussions have been about procedure and organisation and no real progress has been made on any vital matter of substance-    Before he returned to Paris on Monday  (he is returning in a week&apos;s time), M. Tardieu htid a long
conversation with the German representative, and I gather that he was inviting Germany to assume for the moment that the German thesis of equality of treatment might he accepted and on this hypothesis to show herself willing to support the French memorau-dum.      This is tempting for Germany, for she is in the mood to pay almost any price for equality of status,  (i0e03 for the cancellation-tion of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles,)  and M. Tardieu is not, I imagine,  seriously proposing this, hut is merely suggesting that, by malting an assumption in Germany&apos;s favour in the meantime, the German representative might embrace the French proposition about security and the international force.      It is d-oubtless for the same reason that the French are pre-ssing to have a discussion on their memorandum and their claim for further security at an early stage of the Conference.       The U^k1 representatives have expressed no view, in public or in private, on the French memorandum, but I fully expect, when. Mo Tardieu returns next week and we enter upon private discussions of fundaiaental matters as he requests, that he will seek to get some assurances on the point.      The Cabinet will appreciate from my earlier mem.oran.da, that I feel the greatest difficulty is knowing how to deal with the matter,.We have kept in close touch with the representatives of the Dominions throughout at Geneva and are glad to report that there is evident a spirit of the friendliest co-operation between all their members and ourselves.,2.      SJ.that.lon in the Far East-,.The Cabinet will have followed from the telegrams the progress of events, but a short resume may be of service.      In spite of the attempts which we have been making (a) to support
the League and (b) to co-operate with the United States of&quot;America.the difficulty of co-ordinating these two efforts has tended to expose the United Kingdom at Geneva,  and I daresay elsewhere, tothe reproach that we were either (a) working behind the hack ofthe League,  or (h)  failing to show ourselves as vigorous as theUnited States of America were prepared to he.    There is no justi-fication for either of these criticisms hut Geneva is a place where the United Kingdom has not only got to take the lead, hutto take the blame for everything that  is done.      Fortunately,however, the most recent incidents silenced the critics.      OnThursday, February 26th, we learned from Sir Miles Lampson&apos;telegram that the Chinese were in the mood to welcome interventionat Shanghai and at the same time Mr. Katsudaira told me of hisGovernments willingness to see an end of the fighting there andto get a round-table conference set up (see telegram fromSir M. Lampson No. 117 of February 26th and ny telegram to theForeign Office No.  90 of the same day).      The First Lord arrivedat Geneva the same morning and we initiated a plan which led toa public meeting of the Council of the League last evening(February 29th) ,  when the President put forward what was really  ;;the United Kingdom proposition for the re-establishment of peace-ful conditions in the Shanghai area.     Mr. Hugh ,,rilson, theUnited States Minister to Switzerland, and Mr. Norman Davis of theUnited States delegation to the Disarmament Conference, kept inclose touch with us and we were able to secure Mr.  Stimson&apos;s\ ...approval of the text of the declaration and his promise that theUnited States of America would co-operate with the League ofNations  just in time for the meeting.      The proposal,  as the Cabinetknows  (see telegrams to Foreign Office Nos.  95 and 96 of March 1st)was that,  subject to the negotiations for a cessation of hostilities
which were initiated by admiral Kelly on the British flagshin, resulting in the adootion by the Japanese and Chinese Governmentsof the terms for a suspension of hostilities -.hich had been--referred to them,  a local Conference should be set up at Shanghai to he attended by representatives of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the United States, China end Japan for the purpose of consolidating peace in that region on the basis (a) that Japan declared that she had no political or territorial designs and no intention of establishing a Japanese Settlement in Shanghai or of otherwise advancing the exclusive interests of the Japanese, and (b) that China enters the Conference on the basis that the safety and integrity of the International and French Settlements must be preserved under arrangements which will secure these areas and their residents from danger.      In order to isolate the Shanghai trouble from the general question of Sino-Japanese relations, and at the same time to safeguard the position previe lsly taken up both by the League and by the United Stages of America in reference to Manchuria* and President&apos;a proposal included the statement that it wat &quot;without orejudice to or Qualification of any petition previouely taken up by the League of nations or any Power in relation tc Sine-Japanese affairs&quot;.The public meeting of the Council of the League was hull at 6 pdiu  on February 29tb0    After explaining the present position and taxing note of the news we had received that negotiations for a cessation of hostilities were actually proceeding , M* Paul Boncours as President? placed the pro-pcsal before the Councils    An interesting, and indeed striking, scene then followed..    Signer Grand! expressed the concurrence of Italy,    The United Kingdom representative promised the full support of the United Kingdom an.&quot; then added that, having been in close consultation with the United States Government, he wye authorised to communicate the
assurance of the United States Government that it was prepared to associate itself with the  step now being taken and to Instruct its representatives in the Shanghai area to co-operate with the members of the League in the fullest measure In carrying out the proposals which the President had put before the Council.    The United SGates Minister has confirmed this in writing to the Secretary-General of the League.    The French Government expressed its adherence in turn and several other members of the Council added their concurrence.    The Japanese and Chinese representatives both undertook to recommend the proposal forthwith to their respective Governments,    v/e were thus able to secure an absolute correspondence between the action of the United Kingdom and other Powers who were members of the League,  and of the United States of America.    The United States delegation have since expressed themselves as highly satisfied and the effect here has certainly been to give a strong impression cf Anglo-American-co-op e r a t i onMro Matsudaira reported the next day that the Japanese Government accepted the proposal of the Council of the League and the Chinese representative says that he hopes to get a message from his Government tomorrow.There  is a further reason for feeling some satisfaction in the immediate outcome of the above events.    The Assembly of the League meets on Thursday in order to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute which has been referred to it from the Council at the demand of China.    It is to be expected  chat a very difficult discussion will ensue,  especially as the Assembly is attended by so many smaller States whc5 while properly anxious to uphold the authority of the League by any and every means, have themselves-o-
no special responsibilities or anxieties in the Far East.. If only a suspension of hostilities in the Shanghai area has been arranged and can be announced before the Assembly meets,  this will greatly alleviate an anxious and difficult situation...(Initialled)    JoS.GENEVA, 1st March, 1952.
