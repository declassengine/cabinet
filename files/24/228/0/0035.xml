THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.CABINETSecret Copy No.  .Jc . P. 85 (32) . Memorandum by the Minister of Health.MATERNITY SERVICES.1.     For reasons given below, I shall have before long to deal with policy in relation to Maternity Services, and I should be glad of authority to do so In the way outlined later.2.      The rate of maternal mortality, has been practically stationary for 20 years, with a tendency to rise during the last few years.    It compares unfavourably with the rate in certain other countries.   Quite naturally the fact has caused an increasingly active movement for fuller social services? for the benefit of maternity and for the reduction of the mortality rate.   In particular a National Maternity Service has been advocated by many, including official and voluntary bodies, with a strong backing in the press.3.     The present public social services for maternity are of two sorts -(a) Maternity cash benefit, which is payable under the Health Insurance Acts;(b) Local Authorities have power to provide certain services, including ante- and post-natal advice at welfare centres and the securing of a supply of qualified midwives.4.     A National Maternity Service, as advocated by its supporters, would have for its chief purpose the provision, in addition to (b), of free medical and midwifery attendance at maternity.    The cost of the National Service would be met
in pant by the appropriation of a portion of the funds available under (a) for maternity benefit,  and the remainder by an Exchequer grant.    It is estimated, quite roughly, that this charge would be about one and a half million pounds a year.5.      The plan of a National Maternity Service has been powerfully supported.   A scheme was outlined in the Report of the Royal Commission on Health Insurance In 1926, and similar schemes were favoured by two Departmental Committees which were appointed by the present Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1928 - one on the Midwives Acts and the other on maternal mortality.    The British Medical Association published a similar scheme in 1929.6.     Much attention was,  I believe, given to the scheme by the late Labour Government, and in consequence of departmental action then taken,  the scheme actually now holds the field.    That is why the matter has to be dealt with.7.      Cn Cabinet instructions, the Ministry of Health-took the following action under the late Labour administration. A scheme for a National Maternity Service was drawn up and presented to the Consultative Council of the Approved Societies for their consideration.    That Council will naturally expect an expression of this Government&apos;s intentions in the matter.   Further, so much interest is felt in the matter, particularly by influential associations concerned with the welfare of women,  that before long some statement will be unavoidable.    The scheme in short has been started, and if It is to be postponed, we shall have to let that be known.
a.      Under present financial conditions there is, I suppose, no question but that the scheme must be postponed. It needs  1,500,000 from the Exchequer to set it going, and the money,  it seems, is not there.    It Is in short difficult not to agree with the opinion expressed by the Committee on National Expenditure, that the Exchequer cannot now afford to assume .this liability,  and that improvement of the maternity service must be sought without any additional State grant.9.      Such improvement can indeed be sought,  without any additional grant, upon established lines.    Already, in connection with the stimulus given to the matter by the late Government,  the Ministry of Health has by circular pressed local authorities to improve and extend their maternity services under existing powers (as in paragraph 3(a) above).10.      It is in further action on these lines that I should seek measures,  suitable to our present financial difficulties, which should mitigate the evil of maternal mortality, and also alleviate the disappointment of postponing the scheme for a National Service.11.     ,Such action would be as follows.   Further efforts would be made to persuade local authorities that need persuasion, to improve and strengthen their maternity services Stress would be laid on the importance of educating women to make full use of the services provided, and particular attention would be paid to those areas in which the maternal mortality rate is specially high.12.      The Departmental Committee on Maternal Mortality have in preparation their final report and its publication would afford a suitable opportunity for announcing action on these lines.13.      I am aware that some disappointment will nevertheles be caused, especially amongst the various women&apos;s organisation
by the announcement that further progress with a National Maternity Service must be postponed,  but the alternative policy of concentrating on the extension and improvement of the maternity services already provided is, I think, the right one in present circumstances.14.    I should I1J2G,  then,  to be sble on a suitable occasion to state that financial considerations have obliged the Government to decide that further progress with the proposed National Maternity Service must be deferred, but that their policy is not to rest during the postponement, but to encourage the local authorities to expand and improve their existing maternity services.(Intld. )    E.H.Y.Ministry of Health.26th February, 1932.
