[This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed jor the Cabinet.   March 1932.SECRET.CP. 90 (32). Copy No.......,,.CABINET.Reports by Local Governments on the Political Situation in India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly reports from the Local Governments in India.S. H.India Office, Sth March 1932.Government of India.Delhi reports a decline in purely Congress activity, but the general situation there is affected by the Ahrar movement, mentioned in Punjab report, which is the most important development during the week.   Reassuring features are : (a) Decline in the United Provinces, Bengal, Assam and Centi-al Provinces.In the first-named Province, the situation in most districts is now normal. (6) Decline in convictions in several Provinces.(c) Increase of interest in elections in North-West Frontier Province.(d) Some relief in communal tension.On the other hand, there are (1) new development in Ahrar movement in the Punjab ;(2) recrudescence of Red Shirt activity in Peshawar district;(3) deterioration in the tribal situation ;(4) tendency of individual Sikh extremists towards the movement.2. A feature of civil disobedience utterly inconsistent with non-violence is the organisation of attempts to plant Congress flags on public buildings. These have been most in evidence in Bihar and Orissa, but Bengal also reports them. In the former Province, attempts of this sort have on two separate occasions developed into-mass attacks on police stations, which had to be repelled by firing, and other police stations have been threatened.3. We are supplementing the above by separate telegram.The following is the telegram referred to : (1) There are signs of deterioration in the Muslim position. In the Punjab, the Ahrar party have adopted a civil disobedience movement, features of which are boycott of foreign goods, picketing, travelling without tickets on the railways, and posting of letters without stamps. Ostensibly, the movement is based on the Kashmir-grievances, but there is reason to believe that it is linked with and, to some extent, financed by Congress. At present, it is regarded by Muslims generally with suspicion, and has shown no serious activity even in the Punjab, but it may extend there and also elsewhere. Disapproval by Muslims generally of Ahrar civil disobedience will be tempered by a feeling that now is the time to show Muslim strength in order to obtain constitutional demands. This feeling is already con-siderable and is likely to grow until communal decisions are announced.A further manifestation of this is the resolution of the Working Committee of the Muslim Conference passed yesterday, which decided that the following proposal should be put before open session of the Conference which meets at Lahore about the 21st March:--Whereas the minimum demands formulated by the All-India Muslim Conference oir the 1st January 1929, and reiterated in April 1931, have not been accepted, either by the majority community or the British Government, and whereas it is the declared policy of this Conference not to be a party to the framing of any constitution76G      CO   3.32UlHMUinUH
for India unless and until the aforesaid demands are met, the Working Committee^ therefore, calls upon the Moslem members of the Round Table Conference, and the various Committees set up by it, to refuse to serve on them, unless the British Government first announces its acceptance of the said demands. It further advises the Mussulmans to abstain from appearing before these Committees as witnesses or co-operating with them in any other way.Another cause of possible trouble is the forthcoming execution of two Muhammadans for the murder of a bookseller and two assistants in Calcutta. The case has been taken up by the Muslims, with the support of the European Association, on the general proposition that in Bengal, Hindu terrorists escape extreme penalties while Muslim fanatics are hanged. The failure of the tribunal to give any death sentence in the Chittagong armoury raid case has much increased Muslim feeling.(2) Iu personal discussion with the Finance Secretary, Bombay, we gather that the boycott against British firms and brokers in Bombay has intensified and become more effective during the past 10 days and that the situation in this respect may become serious.We are asking Bombay for separate appreciation. Bombay.The situation in the Mofussil districts remains quiet with no new developments. In Bombay city there has been one slight disturbance over the removal of bullion ; otherwise, all quiet and activity mainly confined to picketing, distribution of leaflets and boycott propaganda. A new development was the closure of chemists&apos; and druggists&apos; shops at Princess Street under the threat of picketing. The shops have now reopened under pressure from Commissioner of Police. One secret headquarters of Congress was discovered and raided by the police, resulting in 18 arrests of active workers and the seizure of documents. Action under Ordinance 2, section 3 : Arrests 25, total detained 319. Section 4 : Orders issued 106, total in force is. About 40 arrests for breach of orders. Congress funds Rs. 10,800 forfeited under Ordinance 4.North-West Frontier Province.There has been a definite recrudescence of Red Shirt activity in the Charsadda, Lundkhwar and Swabi centres. Elsewhere, there has been no change in the general situation in the cis-frontier area, which continues satisfactory. Interest in the forth-coming elections is steadily increasing, especially in Peshawar and Hazara districts. Maulana Shaukat Ah visited Kohat and various places in Peshawar district during the week, hut his visits aroused comparatively little interest, except among the Khilafat party. A demonstration was staged for his arrival in Charsadda, which, included 60 Red Shirts in uniform, who were arrested, the remainder being dispersed.In the trans-frontier area the Bajaur and Mohmand situation has deteriorated owing to the persistent efforts of the tfaji and Turangzai, his son, Bahshah Gul, and the Alingar Faqir, to raise the tribes for a jehad. A small Bajaur laskhar has come down to the Amhahar Valley, and an advanced party has entered the Mohmand country. Salarzai lashkar, which had dispersed, is reported to be reassembling near the western borders of Dir State. Further postponement of action may lead to serious conflagration, and notices are being issued warning the tribes concerned that, unless the lashkars disperse and they remove the agitators from their limits by 7th march, air action against named villages will begin on 8th March. . The action taken under Ordinances is as follows: Section 3 : arrests, nil; total -detained, 2.   Section 4 : orders during the week, 17 ; total orders in force, 1,975.Punjab.Manifestations of the civil disobedience movement in the Province generally continue insignificant, and iu Lahore have declined appreciably. Noteworthy developments have been the decision of the Alkali Dal, while remaining outside the Congress as an organisation, to permit individual members to assist the movement, .and the decision of the Ahrars to open their own civil disobedience campaign. Neither decision has as yet materially affected the situation, Muslims generally being gravely suspicious of the Congress tendencies of the Ahrars. The trade situation has slightly improved. The boycott is nowhere effective, though the &quot;Buy Indian&quot;, campaign is not unfruitful of  results.   Communal tension  is   somewhat   easier
following on action against Press.   Security has been demanded from 13 journals and 15 presses.   Arrests under the ordinary law, 26 Ahrars, 80 others ; under Ordinances, 61 Ahrars, 64 others.   Totals to date, 272 and 642 respectively.   Arrests-under section 3 remain at 5; 10 orders issued under section 4.   Total to date, 51. Total convictions for infraction of such orders, 9.Bihar and Orissa.The Province generally is quiet. Numerous further attempts have been made to hoist Congress flags on Government buildings. An attempt at Sheohar Police Station in Muzaffarpur district on 28th February led to firing by the police as already reported. Leaflets are being surreptitiously distributed on a large scale in Patna divisions. Fourteen more notices have been issued under section 4, Emergency Powers Ordinance.   Section 3 is not in force.   Convictions up to 27th February, 4,634.United Provinces.Most districts now report the situation to be normal. Revenue collections are more satisfactory, Allahabad having collected 70 per cent, of the demand. Cawnpore city is still giving trouble. Five bomb iucidents are reported in Allahabad city, apparently commemorative of Chandra Shekhar Azad, but only one casualty resulted. No orders have been issued under section 3, but 10 were passed under section 4, Emergency Powers Ordinance. The number of convictions continues to decline: 1.01 under Ordinances, 312 under ordinary law ; total up to date, 6,471 ; releases, 1,15S.Madras.There has been some slight but not serious increase in civil disobedience activity noticeable in west coast districts and in Kistna. Elsewhere activity is negligible and confined to picketing and surreptitious distribution of leaflets. The arrival of the Lothian Committee was not marked by any serious incidents. Attempts to organise a hostile demonstration in Madras were checked by the arrest of the ringleaders. The campaign of misrepresentation in the Press continues.Bengal.The situation is steadily improving in Calcutta and Dacca division, while there is no deterioration anywhere except in Midnapore district. Some anxiety is felt as to the.attitude of the students. The feature of the week has been the organisation of attempts to hoist the Congress flag on public buildings. Section 3, arrests 22. Section 4, figures incomplete.Assam.Picketing has been started in the Darrang district, but there have been no important developments during the week, and the improvement noticed last week has been maintained.Central Provinces.The week has been quiet throughout the Province and there is nothing to report. Prosecutions, 184 ; convictions, 179.   No extension of Ordinances.Burma.There is nothing of importance to report this week. There have been no government casualties ; 04 under-trials have been released and 595 are still in custody. The price of paddy, which rose suddenly last week-end from about 100 to 110, has continued to rise during week, and is now about 115. This is due mainly to Japanese buying. Collection of taxes continues to make satisfactory progress.From the Resident, Mysore.Coorg. There have been no further arrests and the situation continues satisfactory. In Bangalore there have been no arrests since the last report, and the situation is very quiet.Ajmer Merwara.No change in the situation. There have been 16 arrests in Ajmer under ordinary law.
