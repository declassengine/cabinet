Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IT is necessaiy to consider the action to be taken upon the Report of the Malta Royal Commission. The Report is unanimous. It appears to have been well received; and I feel it would be desirable for the Government to adopt its main proposal without delay.In their Main Recommendation the Commissioners put forward a clear-cut and definite policy for immediate adoption. The Governor strongly endorses the Recommendation; and I am anxious to have the sanction of the Cabinet to take early action upon it.The Recommendation is as follows :  (A) The services of Ministers should be dispensed with.(B) The Constitution should be restored.(C) An election should take place at an early date.The Position in Malta.The position in Malta, it will be recalled, is as follows : In June 1930, the Constitution was suspended in order to meet a difficult situation which had arisen owing to disputes between Lord Strickland&apos;s Ministry and the local ecclesiastical authorities. Certain actions of the Ministry had aroused the opposition of the Bishops who, in anticipation of the local general election, issued a Pastoral Letter, the effect of which was to declare that all persons who voted for the Constitutional (i.e., Lord Strickland&apos;s) party would be refused the sacraments. The state of feeling in the Island was considered by the then Governor to be a menace to public safety, and, on his recommendation, the Constitution was temporarily suspended. Ministers were retained in office as advisers to the Governor, in whose hands the administration was vested. It was hoped that a solution might be arrived at in diplomatic negotiations with the Vatican. These hopes were disappointed, and the Royal Commission was eventually set up to visit the Islands, and examine the political situation and make recommendations as to the steps which should be taken to deal with it, with special reference to the possibility of re-establishing constitutional government. The Commission was composed of Lord Askwith as Chairman, Sir Walter Egerton and Count deSaiis.The Views of the Commission.In putting forward their Recommendation, the Commissioners describe the general position as follows. Ministers have remained in office without respon-aibility and! without power. Popular opinion has had no opportunity of expressing itself through the Legislature; and it is probable that there has been[6578] &apos; b
considerable feeling that, in consequence of the actions of a few persons, the Island as a whole has been punished. They consider that this state of affairs ought not to continue, and that Parliamentary government should be restored at &apos;an early date. They express the view that the Constitution granted in 1921 has not yet had sufficient trial. Whatever errors may have been committed by a few, there is, in their opinion, no reason why the people of the Island should be subjected to the loss of the self-government granted at so recent a date, and in effect, be disfranchised for acts which they have not committed. Some of the politica] parties have put forward proposals for the amendment of the Constitution prior to its restoration. These, in the main, are rejected by the Commissioners, who consider that such changes should be made by the Maltese themselves through the machinery of their Constitution rather than imposed upon them by outside authority. But all the political parties are united on the basic demand that self-government should be restored.The Discharge of Ministers.The Commissioners lay emphasis upon their recommendation that the services of Ministers should be dispensed with as soon as possible. With this both the Governor and I are in entire agreement. Ministers have been in office in an advisory capacity and drawing their salaries for a loiig period; but there has been no Parliament from which they derive authority or to which they are responsible. The position is clearly most anomalous, and has given rise to the feeling that the Imperial Government are unfairly maintaining one political party in office. Lord Strickland, whose difficult temperament is WTell known, has clone little to make the present arrangement work smoothly. The Com-missioners consider that if the Ministry were retained in office to conduct the election, it would give them an undue advantage and give rise to allegations that the Imperial Government was acting unfairly. I, therefore, propose that, provided they have not previously resigned of their own accord, Ministers should be discharged simultaneously with the announcement of the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I understand that an election can be held Within about three months.The Problem of the Church.With regard to the problem of ecclesiastical intervention, the Commissioners state that the Pastoral Letter of 1930 was issued in very special circumstances, and is now obsolete, although it has not been withdrawn. A Pastoral has been issued before each election, and it is to be presumed that a new Pastoral will be issued. before the next election. . The Commissioners express their belief, formed after the most earnest inquiry, that the new Pastoral will be quite different in tone from the Pastoral of 1930. This belief they found upon their long and friendly conversations with the local Bishops, and they state- that it is one of the main considerations which have influenced them in recommending that a new election should be held. -The Commissioners consider that there is no positive action which could be taken by His Majesty&quot; s Government with regard to this aspect of the matter. In this connection, I need hardly emphasize the fact, that Malta is the most strongly Roman Catholic portion of the Empire. The Poman Catholic Church, as the Commissioners point out, has traditionally pos.se&apos;ssed,a very special position there. It is, therefore, necessary to judge the matter from,the standpoint of the special conditions prevailing in Malta.   . -   y ... &apos;To sum up, I strongly recommend that the Commission&apos;^ Main Reedhnnenda-tion should be adopted for immediate action. The Constitution will thSri &apos;he restored to the Maltese people, and this will provide them with an instrument for settling their own problems, including that of ecclesiastical intervention. This and other problems arouse so much contention locally that. I am-convinced that it is wiser for His Majesty&apos;s Government to remain-.alotrtV;frbnf $ieiiviafld allow -the Maltese to work out their Own solutions, As far...as Iriiperial interests are concerned, there is no question of relaxing the safeguards provided in the Constitution of 1921. and there appears to be no doubt that these are adequate.
Minor Points.The Commission put forward various subsidiary proposals. In connection with their Main Recommendation, they advise that the existing Electoral Law shall be repealed and a former Electoral Law revived in order to provide a legal basis for the new election, which will not be open to question in the Courts. I need hardly trouble the Cabinet with the details of this matter; but I annex a note which explains the technical reasons lying behind the Recommendation. Subject to consultation with the Governor and my Legal Advisers, I propose to adopt it.In addition to their Main Recommendation, the Commission have put forward various &quot; Suggestions&quot; for change. The Main Recommendation is expressly stated to be in no way contingent upon the adoption of these &quot; Suggestions.&quot; I do not, therefore, propose to trouble the Cabinet for a decision on these points. They will be examined in consultation with the Governor in due course. In the meantime I will confine myself to the following remarks upon them. The passage from the Report summarising these &quot;Suggestions&quot; is annexed. It will be seen that they are of varying importance. There are three which involve considerations of policy. The first is the suggestion that there should be an alteration with regard to the language curriculum in the Elementary Schools when sufficient expression of local opinion has been given in favour of it. The second is the suggestion that the appointment of Judges should be made a &quot; reserved matter,&quot; and the third the suggestion that if the present police system works unsatisfactorily it should be amended by an alteration of the Constitution (i.e., by being made also a &quot; reserved matter &quot;).The &quot; Suggestions &quot; as a whole may be grouped in three categories, viz. : (i) Those which should definitely be acted upon before the restoration of/(ii) Those which can be adopted at any time;______/ythe Constitution])___-  ---(iii) Those ot which the adoption would depend upon the course of fixture events.In the first category comes the proposal that the procedure in the Law Courts should be altered by Ordinance of the Governor before the return to self-govern-ment. The Courts undoubtedly call for some reform, and, subject to the views of the Governor and my Advisers on points of detail. I propose that this suggestion should be acted on. In the second category fall the suggested alteration in the method of appointing the Judges and various proposals on niinor matters. The adoption of some of these would involve the passage of an Act of Parliament, and I do not propose to come to any immediate decision upon these points. Before deciding upon them, it will be desirable to observe the trend of public opinion in Malta as expressed at the general election.In the third category fall the proposals with regard to the alteration of the language curriculum in the Elementary Schools, and to the possible modification of the police system. The suggestions of the Commission on the first of these points are contingent upon further expression of local opinion, and, on the second, upon further observation by the Governor of the working of the police system. There is, therefore, no question of coming to a decision on them at present.P. C.-L.Colonial Office, February 13, 1932.[6578]
APPENDIX I.Note explaining object of the Recommendation of the Malta Royal Commission that prior to the next Election in Malta, the Electoral Act of 1929 should be repealed and the Electoral Act of 1924 be revived.(1) The Electoral Act of 1929 repealed the Electoral Act of 1924. If the Electoral Act of 1929 should be invalid, the repeal would be invalid, and the 1924 Act would hold the field.(2) The 1929 Act was, in 1930, declared to be invalid by the Malta Court of Appeal.(3) The 1929 Act was then validated by a Governor&apos;s Ordinance. This Ordinance has also been declared to be invalid by the Court of Appeal.(4) The Governor *s Ordinance was subsequently validated by an Imperial Order-in-Council. If the Order-in-Council is valid, then it follows that the 1929 Act is valid.  This is the essential point in the chain of argument.(5) But the validity of the Order-in-Council is itself challenged by the political parties in Malta. The matter has not been tested in the Courts, and the best legal opinion inclines to the view that the Order-in-Council is valid. But it is clear that the position is not free from doubt, and that there is material for a long legal dispute.(6) Now suppose the election is held under the 1929 Act. It is almost certain that the losing side will bring the question of the validity of the Act before the courts. The new Government would, therefore, have to carry on while the case was being fought up to the Privy Council. The legality of its position would be open to doubt, and it would be faced with the possibility that the whole Legis-lature might be unseated and all the Laws it passed would be invalid.(7) What is the good of restoring the Constitution if the new Government is to be faced with this prospect ? It is clearly desirable to devise a way of getting round this difficulty, and giving the new Government a good start.(8) The obvious way of doing this is to pass an Act of the Imperial Parlia-ment validating directly or indirectly the 1929 Act.(9) But this will take a long time, and Malta cannot be kept indefinitely in the present state of suspense. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether some other method is possible, and the Commission have put forward the following ingenious scheme : (a) Enact a new Ordinance repealing the 1929 Act and reviving the 1924 Act.(&amp;) The validity of this Ordinance will depend on the validity of the Order-in-Council.So, as is seen above, does the 1929 Act.(c) Now, if the losing side in an election fought under the 1924 Act succeed in upsetting the validity of the Order-in-Council, they will not only upset the validity of the Governors Ordinance, but also the validity of the 1929 Act. In that event, the Electoral Act of 1924 will never have been validly repealed, and will hold the field.(d) But suppose the result is that the Courts declare the Ovder-in-Councilto be valid, then the Governors Ordinance repealing the 1929 Act and reviving in terms the 1924 Act will be valid.(e) Therefore, whatever happens, the 1924 Act will be valid.   The losing-side are thus placed in a dilemma. If they bring the matter before the Courts, an election conducted under the 1924 Act will be valid whether they win or lose. Therefore, they will not contest the matter, and there will be no doubt as to the sound legal position of the new Legislature.
APPENDIX II.Extract from Report of Royal CommissionSummary of Suggestions and of Main Recommendation.In the previous Chapters we have indicated that our main recommendation is that: (A) The services of Ministers should be dispensed with.(B) The Constitution should be restored.(C) An election should take place at an early date.We have in addition referred to matters with regard to which changes might be made. Some of these suggested changes are of quite a small character. It may be convenient to group these suggestions according to the method of legislation which would be required to give effect to them : I. By Ordinance of the Governor.A change which we consider would be very valuable would be the adoption of such parts of the Report of the Committee of Maltese lawyers upon the procedure in the Law Courts as may commend themselves to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, though we would suggest that the lower Courts should have jurisdiction over cases which involve a somewhat larger sum than that which the Committee have fixed. This change proposed by the Maltese Committee we think would be of considerable advantage if adopted by the Governor and would not entail any alteration of the Constitution under the restriction imposed by the Order in Council. We consider that it should be effected by the enactment of an Ordinance by the Governor before the Constitution is restored: After the Constitution is restored any advisable amendments could be made by the Maltese Legislature.II. By Letters Patent.(1) As soon as it may be convenient to issue Letters Patent, there should be inserted in them, under the powers of Section 68 of the Letters Patent of 1921, a revision of Schedule A, annexed to Section 63, making the sum allotted to the Judges, under the heading &quot; Other Services,&quot;  5,500.(2) In the same Letters Patent, under the powers of Section 6S, Section 57 of the Letters Patent of 1921 should be altered so that trials in Criminal Courts shall be conducted throughout, with the exception of entries in the notarial register, in English or Maltese respectively, in cases where the accused persons are of British or Maltese origin, and, in cases where both British and Maltese are jointly accused, in both English and Maltese, with the proviso that when the cases are tried in English the jury should be able to understand the English language.(3) If and when the Secretary of State for the Colonies is satisfied that sufficient expression of opinion is given in support of an alteration in the elementary schools and that there is a desire on the part of the people in the Island for an alteration, we consider that, under the powers of Section 68, the terms of Section ,57 should be so altered as to allow of a change in the method of teaching in the elementary schools and the requirements for proceeding to the secondary schools. The manner in which this should be accomplished is, in the opinion of two of us, an amendment making English the extra language to be taught in addition to the native Maltese in the elementary schools and to be the extra language necessary for children proceeding to the secondary schools, with the provision that Italian should be taught to children as soon as they have entered the secondary schools, with a view to the acquirement of a third language and enabling those children who intend to enter professions to have the advantage of a wider educational scope, and to pass examinations for the law and medicine.
III. By Act of the Imperial Parliament.There are certain other changes which, if imposed by the Imperial authorities, could constitutionally only be effected by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. If it should be thought desirable and feasible at an early date to introduce such a measure, the following changes might, in our opinion, udvisedly be made : (1) For future elections we have made, in Chapter VII, suggestions for placing the Trade Union Council on a better basis. If an Act of Parliament should be decided on, a clause might be inserted providing for the autonomy of the Trade Union Council on the lines mentioned in that Chapter.(2) The provision of the Letters Patent of 1921; that the Judges are to be appointed by the Governor in Council should be amended, so that the appointment of Judges may be made a reserved matter and taken out of the province of the Maltese Ministry. The persons appointed to be Judges should have had at least twelve years&apos; experience either as Counsel or on the Magisterial bench. These appointments should not necessarily be confined to men educated at the University of Malta or to Maltese by birth. Although a wider field of selection might not be drawn upon, it may be desirable that it should exist, in case it should become necessary to strengthen the prestige and efficiency of the law in Malta.(3) A provision should be inserted to the effect that there should be a limitation of the period within which the validity of any laws purporting to have been passed by the Legislature could be impugned in a Court of Law.(4) In the body of the Report the position of the police is considered. We think that the treatment of the Force has been too frequently influenced by party considerations. Such a position impairs efficiency and leads to apprehensions that efforts to maintain law and order will be misjudged for political reasons.Our desire is that the Constitution should be restored with as few amendments as possible, and. therefore, though we think the position of the superior officers might well be made more secure, we only recom-mencl that the Governor should watch carefully the working of the present police system and later, if it works unsatisfactorily, make recommendations to the Imperial Government regarding its amend-ment. Such amendment would presumably have to be effected by Act of Parliament. Any drastic revision of the Constitution required by the situation could only be achieved by this method.(5) An amendment should be made in Section 30 of the Letters Patent, removing the disqualification of certain classes of voters, however small in number, and allowing persons disqualified as voters under that Section to vote after a maximum period of eight years, the period to be at the discretion of the Court by which the person was sentenced. In the case of persons sentenced to hard labour the maximum period should be five years, and in the case of persons sentenced to simple imprisonment the maximum period should be two years.(6) Lastly, should it be decided to have recourse to an Act of Parliament, we consider that it would be advisable to include in it a general endorsement of the Letters Patent of 1921, 1928 and 1930 and all that has been done thereunder, including the Order in Council of 1930 and the Ordinances thereunder, and the Acts of the Maltese Legislature validated by Ordinance, saying the rights of the Maltese Legislature to repeal or amend such Acts of the Legislature. There should not be inpluded an endorsement of the Electoral Act No. XXVI of 1929, as we think if should be repealed and the election be held under the Electoral Act of 1924, as amended by Acts Nos. JII and XXXI of 1927.
Main Recommendation.We desire, in conclusion, to state clearly that our main recommendation is not in any way contingent upon effect being given to the foregoing suggestions. That recommendation and the steps which we advise should be taken for giving effect to it may be summarised as follows: (1) Parliamentary government should be restored and an election should take place in due course.(2) We strongly advise that the services of Ministers should be dispensed with at an early date, in order that the election may be, as far as possible, free from political bias and from the allegation that undue influence has been exercised. We consider the officials quite capable of conducting the election under the instructions of the Governor without the assistance of Ministers.(3) Parliamentary government can be restored by the issue of a proclama-tion by the Governor taking out of operation the Order in Council of the 26th June, 1930, in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the Order.(4) Prior to the restoration of Parliamentary government the Electoral Act No. XXYI of 1929 should be repealed by Governors Ordinance, and the Electoral Act of 1924, as amended by Acts Nos. Ill and XXXI of 1927, should be re-enacted in the same Ordinance. The election should then be held under the Electoral Act of 1924 as amended in 1927.(5) The election should not be a continuation of the election commenced under the Electoral Act No. XXYI of 1929 and subsequently suspended.(6) For the purpose of the election, the Governor, under the powers given to him under the Letters Patent of 1921, should nominate such Trade Unions as he thinks fit to form a constituent body to elect members for the Trade Union Council entitled to appoint two representatives to the Senate, advisably omitting small benefit unions or unions not representative in their character, but not ignoring unions because they failed to register under Act No. XXI of 1929. Local advice should be taken upon the selection in such manner as the Governor may determine.We do not think that an election carried out in the manner we have suggested could be successfully impugned in a Court of Law or that there would be any risk that those who are returned as members of the Legislature could be unseated upon the ground that the election was invalid.We are not able to advise any step to be taken by Your Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment with regard to any new Pastoral likely to be issued, but we would repeat our belief that any new Pastoral will be of a different character from the Pastoral of 1930, and we would refer again to the paragraphs with which we closed the main body of our Report before summing up these conclusions.
