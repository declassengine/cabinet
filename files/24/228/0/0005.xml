C V CP. 55 (52V- --/-CABINET.TRAWLING IN THE MORAY FIRTH AND THE FIRTH OF CLYDEoMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.It is particularly desirable that the Moray Firthquestion on which disagreement has existed between&amp;n the ForeignOffice, the Admiralty, the Board of Trade and the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries on the one hand and the scottish office on the other for many years, should be definitelysettled.      In the first place, the existence of this disagree-ment has hampered the action of the Government in resistingclaims by foreign Pov/ers to exercise exclusive jurisdiction in bays, and in the second,place it is delaying the reply toa proposal made by the Netherlands Government as long ago asMay last to hold a Conference for the Revision of the   north sea Convention of 1882.      Amongst other proposals fordiscussion at the Conference is the revision of the rules toavoid conflicts between different fishing vessels includingthe protection of nets in the open sea.      Although the damage to the cod-nets in the Moray Firth is one of the specialgrievances of Scottish fishermen, the Scottish Office haveopposed the holding of this Conference unless their views withregard to the closing of the Moray Firth are met.There has been a tendency in recent years to recognise the exclusive right of a State to a bay when (a)  a claim tosuch a right has existed for a great number of years    and(b) when the bay is narrow at the entrance in proportion toits depth.      The Moray Firth complies with neither of these requirements.      It is in the area covered by the North SeaConvention, which limits the exclusive right of fishing inbays to the area enclosed by a line drawn three miles to seaward of a line drawn across the bay in the part nearest the-1-
entrance where the width Sciss not exceed ten miles.There is no suggestion in the Convention of the   T^seTrvtrtinri: ofthe Moray Pirth or any similar area as territorial waters (v/hichwould embrace exclusive fishing rights),  and since 1907 no attempt has been made to prevent foreign trawlers fishing there.As regards formation,  the Moray Firth is seventy-three milesacross at the entrance and from the centx*e of the entrance tothe centre of the line three miles to seaward of the line where firstit/narrows to ten miles (i.ec  the line within which foreigners may not fish)  is only some fifty-three miles.    Lord Loreburn, when Lord Chancellor, was consulted in connection with the Mortensen case referred to in paragraph 2 of the memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and expressed the following opinion.    &quot;From the point of view of international law, I think it is quite clear that a British Act of Parliament cannot,  as against any foreign vessel, affect the right of fishing in the high seas,  though of course it is binding upon British subjects... ..00 I cannot help thinking that the entire policy of this Act (i^e.. Herring Fishery,  Scotland Act,  1899) , was wrong and though the Court of Session has decided that In terms it applied to foreigners, yet that it cannot in practice be applied to foreign-ers outside territorial waters without a grave breach of inter-national law.  ........ It is by agreement alone that foreign shipscan be touched on the high seas and I think no nation has nearly so great an interest as Great Britain has in maintaining this rule inviolate.    I think the same of the rale which allows fishing outside the three-mile limitI note that the Secretary of State for Scotland considers that solutions (a)  and (b) in his memorandum are open to consider-able objection from the point of view of other Departments.    With regard to proposal (a) which is to endeavour to negotiate with the Powers concerned a convention requiring foreign fishermen to observe the same restrictions as are applied to British fishermen, I feel that there is also considerable objection?    The suggestion is supported by the/
argument that because foreign vessels have had the exclusive privilege of trawling in the Moray Firth and the Firth of Clyde for twenty-five years,  it is reasonable that they should now agree to discontinue doing so.      In my opinion this argument is unlikely to weigh with the Powers concerned as they would regard it as entirely our own affair that we chose to prohibit our trawlers from fishing in a particular area.      Moreover, the Governments principally concerned, the Netherlands, Belgian and German Governments, would simply be making a concession in return for nothing.      The Danish and Icelandic Governments would be certain to claim some quid pro quo which would doubtless take the form of amendments to the convention of 1901, between the United Kingdom and Denmark governing waters surrounding the Faroe Islands and Denmark coasts close areas of sea adjacent to those islands which are valuable fishing grounds for British trawlers.      Norway and Sweden are not parties to the North Sea Convention and so would presumably not attend the Conference;    but if we asked these Governments to stop their trawlers- fishing in the Moray Firth they would, no doubt,  adopt the same attitude as Denmark and Iceland.      I understand that representa-tives of the British Trawlers&apos; Federation were received by the Secretary of State for Scotland in the Labour Ministry in July last, when they expressed strong opposition to the closing of the Moray Firth on the grounds of injury which they anticipated the British trawling industry would suffer in foreign waters as the result.      The trawling industry is, of course, by no means exclusively confined to England. My conclusion is that the time has arrived when it is necessary, in the wide interests of this country, that the Moray Firth should be thrown open to all trawlers without restriction within the limits laid down by the North Sea Convention;    that the
oinvitation of the Netherlands Government to attend the Conference for the revision of the North Sea Convention should be accepted, and that, inter alia, arrangements should be made at the Conference for the better protection of nets, which would be of considerable assistance to the Moray Firth fishermen..    I have no doubt that arrangements can be made for more fishery protection vessels to be employed in the Moray Firth and, if necessary, in the Fix-th of Clyde, to prevent unnecessary damage by trawlers a(Intldo)    J.
