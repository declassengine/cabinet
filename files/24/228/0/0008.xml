Secretary of State.In trie ccurse of conversation with me this morning the Belgian Ambassador - who is a warm friend of the United States, where he was Ahbassador for nearly ten years - referred twice,  and in terms of asperity and indeed &quot;bitterness, to what he described as the clumsy attempts of the   United States Government to draw us into exclusive action with them in the Far East.      He said this would be much resented both by Italy and France. (Curiously enough he emphasised the former more than the latter).      He also referred to the League of Nations, and made some acid comment on the American action in that connection also0We must walk very warily in all this.      Our first instruction to LIndley  at   Tokyo included his French and Italian colleagues, though their action, if any, was bound to bo later than his.      Our second, and more important,  instruction contemplated American collaboration only.      I think that we snail hava to continue this mixtures and mix the dcses very carefully&apos;.,     We shall have to proceed frem day to day? and lay down no hard and fast line in advance0      So far we have managed pretty well, without offending either side.(Signed)    Hs VANSITTART.january,, 30th,. 1952,(Intld) .

Circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,Shanghai situation - co-operation with the United States Government.Minute by Sir R. Vansittert*I asked Mr. Atherton the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires to come and see me this afternoon, and explained to him the events of the last 24 hours and gave him the substance of our telegrams Nos. 21 to Tokyo and No 71 to Washington.,   I also explained to him the delay in answering Mr0 Stimson&apos;s first overture on Monday.   I pointed out the difficulty in the first course proposed by Mra Stimson. and said that we had been thinking how this difficulty might best be turned or overcome.   We had been thinking of suggesting to his government a course that would not have laid us open to any possible retort from the Japanese government, When the information brought by the Japanese First Secretary as described in telegram Noc21 to Tokyo of January 28th? had precipitated matters0   Mr0 Atherton would note that the last sentence of the first paragraph made it impossible for the Japanese government to give the reply that we hod apprehended in regard to Mr, Stimson&apos;s first proposal,.   Matters had, however, now taken a graver turn, and I proceeded to read him your telegram No.22 to Tokyo of this afternoon
2.afternoon.   Mr. Atherton asked, if -we had asked any other Powers to join us besides the United States government.   I said that in regard to the latter and more important telegram we had addressed ourselves for collaboration to the United States government only.    In regard to the earlier one Sir Po Lindley was to address himself first to his American colleague, and I hoped that they would both have acted as nearly simultaneously as possible.   We had also informed Paris and Rome and if those governments would support their British and American colleagues, so much the better;   but they could necessarily only act after their colleagues,&apos; Mr. Atherton seemed very pleased at all this;    and said he would inform his government at once, particularly in regard to our difficulty in replying earlier to Mr. Stimson&apos;s first suggestion, a difficulty which he quite understood and appreciated,,January 29th,  1932.*
