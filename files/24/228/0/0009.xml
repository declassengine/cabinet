THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GQVEHKMEKT. SECRET. COPY NO.   90.P .5 9(34)CABINET.PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS ON TRAWLING IN THE MORAY FIRTH -AND the pihtitop CLYDE.----Note by the President of the Board of TradeI am in entire agreement with the views on this question expressed in the memoranda of the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP. 37(32)) tvad of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (0,P, 42(32)).     While I have great sympathy with the Soottish fishermen I oannot place their Interests before the more impor-tant interests to which attention is drawn in those two memoranda.From the point of view of the Mercantile Marine it will be impossible to agree to any proposal whioh would support in any way the extension of the territorial waters limit beyond three miles.I should r.ot see any objection to an amendment of the North Sea Fisheries Ooir.ver.tion provided that suoh a course were deemed necessary in the interest of cur fishing industry as a whole, but I should strongly oppose any Convention whioh sought in any way dlreotly or indirectly to extend the jurisdiction of this country over foreign vessels beyond the three-mile limit.W.R.Board of Trade,1st February,  1932.
