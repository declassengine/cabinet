SURVEY OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, MARCH 1932.INTRODUCTORY.1. The departure of Great Britain from the gold standard last September was followed by a marked aggravation of the conditions of economic depression and financial crisis prevailing in the world gener-ally. On the other hand, the competitive position in world markets of Great Britain and other countries whose currencies have fallen along with sterling has been materially improved. The trend of business conditions in Great Britain has been in large measure the resultant effect of these two opposing, influences, complicated by certain special features of our local situation.I THE  WORLD   SITUATION, (a) General Survey.2. In all countries remaining on the gold standard, the period since September last has been marked by a further heavy fall in prices, by the growth of widespread financial distrust, and by a large fall in the volume of production. The destruction of financial confidence has entailed an extraordinary paralysis of the mechanism of international finance. Long-term international lending has been virtually suspended; and creditor countries have recalled, or attempted to recall, money which they had lent on short term abroad. This has endangered the exchange stability of those countries which have obligations to meet; and has led many of them, as a measure of self-defence, to improvise restrictions on exchange dealings, in some cases of an extremely drastic nature, which constitute a new and fomrida^e obstacle in the way of international trade. Countries with strong exchange positions have added further obstacles in their turn by the adoption of quota schemes and tariff surtaxes designed to protect their industries from the disturbance threatened by these abnormal con-ditions. The result has been to diminish very seriously the volume of world trade, and to intensify the atmosphere of uncertainty and distrust. We deal briefly with these various developments in the paragraphs that follow.(b) The Financial Crisis.8. After Great Britain went off gold, commodity prices suffered a further considerable fall in gold standard countries. The gold wholesale prices of the principal commodities subject to dealings in international markets fell, according to the Economises special index number, by 11-2 per cent, between the 18th September, 1981, and the 10th February, 1982, while the sterling wholesale prices of the same commodities rose in the same period by 17-8 per cent. The general index numbers of sterling wholesale prices (which include a much wider range of commodities) have, of course, risen much less, the Economist index number showing a rise of 8-8 per cent, by the 10th February, and the Board of Trade a rise of 6-9 per cent, by the end of January, while the Ministry of Labour cost of living index number has risen by only 2 points.4. This fall of 112 per cent, in gold prices in the last five months is additional, of course, to the heavy fall over the last three years from which we suffered in common with the rest of the world; and it has necessarily entailed an intensification of the financial crisis in gold-standard countries. Financial institutions are commonly in the position of having liabilities which are fixed in terms of money, covered mainly by assets the value or security of which is dependent on the prices of commodities. It is thus possible for the strongest financial institutions in the world to be reduced to insolvency by a fall of prices which is sufficiently severe. Inasmuch as the fall of prices had already proceeded far enough last summer to cause the general condition of financial anxiety which was mainly responsible for driving us off the gold standard, it is not surprising that the further fall of gold prices
should have greatly aggravated the situation in countries which are still on gold. The difficulties of financial institutions in these countries have been further increased by the fact that those of them which held sterling balances have suffered serious exchange losses. On the other hand, in the weaker countries, the position of some institu-tions lias been eased to a greater extent by reason of the fact that they owed sterling to Great Britain.5. There was until just recently a marked increase in the number of bank suspensions in the United States. In the single month of October 1931, 512 banks, with deposits of 567 million dollars, were suspended, while for the last quarter of 1931 the suspensions were 1,034 banks, with deposits of 969 million dollars. This compares with 1,345 banks suspended, with deposits of 865 million dollars, in the whole of the year 1930. In France and Belgium also a number of small banks have closed and a number of important banks have had to be assisted. In all three countries the note issue figures reveal a growing tendency on the part of the public to hoard currency. The above statistical indications, however, convey an inadequate impression of the extent to which financial anxiety and distrust prevail in the countries with the largest gold reserves and the strongest exchange positions. On the other hand, the rise in sterling prices has tended to ease somewhat the position of financial institutions in Great Britain and other countries whose currencies have fallen with sterling.(c) Production and Employment.6. The reactions which these conditions have exerted upon industrial activity are shown in the following table : Table 1. Indices of Industrial Production.Base 1928 - 100.Year.	United Kingdom.

They provide a fair enough clue, however, to the different trends of production in the various countries. It will be observed that French industry, which was slow to suffer seriously from the world depression, and which, indeed, maintained as late as the second quarter of 1931 a volume of produc-tion higher than that of 1928, has undergone a serious decline in recent months. A further point to be noted is the recovery of production in the last quarter of 1931 in Great Britain and Sweden (whose currency has moved with sterling) in contrast to the continued decline in the gold-standard countries.7. The available figures for unemployment tell a similar tale. In all gold-standard countries unemployment has continued to increase rapidly in recent months. In Germany the registered numbers of unemployed reached in January 1932 the huge figure of 6,041,000, an increase of about 1,150,000 over the previous January; while the trade union figures show for December 1931 42&apos;2 per cent, wholly unemployed and 22&apos;S per cent, partially unemployed. In France only a comparatively small proportion of the unemployed are registered; but the figures show an increase from 45,000 in January 1931 to 279,000 in January 1932. The French index of industrial employment shows a decline of 13-4 per cent, in January
(d) Restrictions on Exchange Dealings.8. The network of exchange transfer restrictions which has grown up in the past year, and particularly during the last few months, is one of the most remarkable features of the present world economic situation. It is in Central Europe that this phenomenon has reached its most intricate development and presents its most baffling problems. But restriction on exchange dealings of one kind or another exist in many other parts of the world, and are especially drastic in South America.9. Exchange control is, indeed, practically universal throughout South America: and hardly anywhere is it possible to obtain exchange with anything approaching ease. The most drastic system of exchange restriction in the world is that maintained by Chile, where creditors are at present only able to obtain the derisory allowance of 2 per cent, a month upon their bills. The prejudicial effects of these exchange restrictions on international trade can be best illustrated by the following figures relating to British exports.Table 2.British Exports to south American Countries in 1929, 1930 and 1931.(Values as percentages of corresponding quarter of 1929.)Country.

Chile, moreover, is normally an important market for British goods, our exports to that country in recent years having been about  6 millions. As will be seen from the following table, United States trade with South America showed an even more marked  decline.1982, as compared with January 1981. Similarly, in the United States, the Bureau of Labour Index of numbers employed in irianu-facturing industry show a decline of 18 per cent, in December 1931, as compared with December 1930, while the Index of Pay-Roils shows a decline of aggregate earnings of 25 per cent, in the same period.

This would be especially marked in the 4th quarter of 1931 owing to the suspension of the gold standard in this country.10. In Europe also exchange control is to-day very widespread, the control in most cases being effected by the centralization of exchange dealings in the hands of the Central Banks. Systems of exchange restrictions have been imposed with two objects in view, namely, (i) to prevent the withdrawal of foreign and domestic capital, and (ii) to limit directly the volume of foreign imports. Countries in which the restrictions imposed have seriously impeded the flow of international trade are Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Norway, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia. Great Britain, Sweden, and Finland, in which foreign dealings were at one time restricted, have now abolished control. In Central Europe the restrictions on exchange dealings have led to further developments, which deserve attention.11. The foreign trade of South American countries is mainly overseas with peoples who are their creditors. In these circumstances the restriction of imports by exchange control tends to serve its purpose of improving the* balance of trade and providing funds for the discharge of foreign obligations. The trade of the embarrassed debtor countries of Central Europe, on the other hand, is largely with neighbours in a similar position of financial difficulty. Thus the spear-head of the exchange restrictions imposed by all of these countries is directed at one another, with the result of a serious contraction of their mutual trade to their common detriment, but without any appreciable strengthening of their power to meet their foreign obligations. The manifest folly of this position led the Bank for International Settle-ments to call a Conference at Prague of Central European Central Banks, with a view to finding a remedy. This Conference led to little direct result; but, following upon it, the countries of Central Europe began to negotiate bi-lateral clearing agreements with their neighbours with the object of freeing their mutual trade from the restrictive effects of exchange control. A considerable number of these agreements have been entered into, by Austria and Hungary in particular, though the development of the tendency has been slowed down as the result of the protests of Reconstruction Loan holders.12. Under these clearing agreements, the importer of goods from the other country party to the arrangement pays the value in his own currency to his own Central Bank; while the exporter in the other country receives payment in his currency from his Central Bank. The two Central Banks credit and debit one another with the appropriate sums. The arrangements for dealing with any net balance vary from one agreement to another; but, essentially, the clearing agreements are based on the principle not, indeed, actually of barter-but of direct exchange, imports being freed from the obstacles of exchange control in so far as exports are taken in return.13. This system of bilateral agreements tends inevitably to pre-judice the trade interests of countries which are not parties to them. The effect, of a clearing agreement is that the countries which are parties to it give one another preferential terms as against the rest of the world ; and though the preference is not precisely measurable like a tariff preference, it may in practice be even more important. A country which has entered into a clearing agreement prefers to import from the other party to it rather than from elsewhere, and tends accordingly to use the instrument of exchange-control so as to excludeTable 3.United States Trade with South America.
as far as possible imports from other countries. On the other hand, it prefers, as a rule, tq direct its exports to countries with which it has no agreement. Under this regime of clearing agreements accordingly the &quot;most-favoured-nation &quot; clause is rendered largely nugatory, and the countries which have relied on this as a principal instrument of commercial policy may be compelled to reconsider their position. The practical importance of these agreements has, however, been limited by the possibility of evasion. In Austria and Hungary, in particular, surreptitious dealings in foreign exchange are taking place at rates below the official level on the so-called ;&apos; Black Bourse.&quot; Hitherto British trade with these countries, in spite of the fact that no clearing agreement has been negotiated, has not declined more severely than with the world as a whole.14. These clearing agreements have not been confined to embarrassed debtor countries. Switzerland, though in a strong financial position, has negotiated clearing agreements with Austria and Hungary, in order to protect her industries from adverse discrimination.(e) Other Restrictions on Foreign Trade.15. International trade has been impeded not only by the system or exchange control but by the growth of other types of restriction. Tariffs have been increased in several countries. Some countries have increased their tariffs largely in order to fortify an uncertain exchange position. France, on the other hand, has imposed special &apos;&apos; exchange compensation surtaxes &apos;&apos; on imports from countries with depreciated exchanges, in order to protect her industries against what is commonly called &quot;exchange dumping.&quot; Canada has acted in a similar manner. Thus the widespread departures from the gold standard since last September have led for different reasons to an increase in tariff barriers both in foreign countries that have left gold and in those which still remain upon it.16. There has also been a widespread adoption in Europe of systems of import restriction, commonly taking the form of quota schemes, under which the volume of imports of particular commodities is limited to a maximum fixed for each country by reference to the imports from that country in previous years. In so far as such quota schemes operate effectively, they confront countries which are faced with the necessity of improving their balance of trade with an extremely rigid obstacle. No improvement in competitive power, whether as the result of a depreciated exchange or a drastic cutting of the money costs of production can enable a country to increase its exports to markets where imports are effectively regulated by quota schemes. Import restrictions have been applied by countries in a strong exchange position, notably by France and Switzerland, in order to protect their industries from the possibility of abnormal competition. In Switzerland the system has been adopted with the special purpose of limiting imports from Germany. The Polish quota scheme is also believed to be mainly directed against Germany. The countries imposing import restrictions of one kind or another are, however, very numerous and include, in addition to France, Switzerland and Poland, the following European countries : the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Latvia, Turkey arid Germany. Taking import restrictions and exchange control agreements together, the system constitutes a serious threat to the trade interests of countries which do not enter into bilateral arrangements. For example, the restrictions imposed by Germany on the import of coal appear to be largely concentrated upon British coal, since Germany is precluded by her bilateral agreements from dealing drastically with coal imports from other countries. The monthly quota has been progressively cut since last autumn and is now reduced to less than one-third of the figure for last September.(f) The General Position of International Trade.17. The network of restrictions and obstacles described in the previous sections represents one of the most baffling and disconcerting of the &quot;vicious circles&quot; set up by the depression. Each country, preoccupied by the urgent problem of improving or preserving its own balance of trade, feels itself driven to take measures which necessarily make for mutual impoverishment.   The attempts to break through
this vicious circle by bilateral agreements based on the principle of direct exchange are largely ineffective and serve to increase the difficulties for the rest of the world. So long as these tendencies exist, a continuous contraction of the volume of world trade is the inevitable result.(g) The Problem of Central Europe.18. With the low prices prevailing for primary products, it is extremely difficult for debtor countries generally to meet their foreign obligations unless they are assisted by further credits, and in the prevailing financial distrust it is very difficult to see how such credits can be provided. This gives rise to a dangerous situation, which is especially critical in Central Europe. The fall of sterling and the appreciable rise in the sterling prices of primary commodities which has followed are factors tending to relieve the embarrassments of the South American communities, and it might only require a moderate-increase in the level of gold prices to effect a striking improvement in their position which would in turn help to restore financial confidence.19.   In a large part of Central Europe, on the other hand, the difficulties are more complex and more intractable.   The exports of many of the embarrassed countries of Central Europe consist mainly not of primary commodities which can still be marketed in the world with some approach to freedom, but of manufactured goods, the movement of which is increasingly obstructed by the formidable-network of restrictions described above.   Most of these countries,, moreover, still maintain their currencies at gold parity, and take the-view that it is a vital necessity for them to do so.   They suffer, accordingly, from an impaired competitive power in world markets, and from the general decline in gold prices.   They are thus driven to desperate measures in order to reduce their money costs of production, with the result of intensifying further the depression of their domestic trade and aggravating their financial difficulties.   In seeking at all costs to remain on the gold standard, Central European countries are influenced by two considerations : first, the belief, which is a dogma throughout Central Europe, that, if the currency were once allowed to fall, it would be impossible to prevent an unlimited inflation r secondly,  the fact that the greater part of their heavy foreign indebtedness is fixed in terms of gold.    It is permissible to doubt whether undue weight is not given to these considerations in view of the apparent hopelessness of a solution of the deadlock along the present lines.   At present, the ability of Central European debtors to meet their foreign obligations appears to be steadily worsening rather than improving.   The impressive export surplus which Germany had built up by the third quarter of 1981 has already been reduced to comparatively small dimensions.   In these circumstances, it is not easy to see how a financial catastrophe in Central Europe can be averted, failing a really satisfactory solution of the German Reparations problem.   Indeed, it is somewhat doubtful whether even a completely satisfactory solution of the problem of Reparations would suffice by itself to avert this danger, though it is difficult to estimate the effect which such an arrangement might have in reviving public confidence in Germany and consequently in restoring her capacity to obtain foreign credits.(h) Gold Movements.20. We turn to consider some important developments in other-parts of the world. The first of these is the striking change which has. occurred in the movements of gold since our departure from the gold standard. The withdrawal by France and certain other European countries of short-term balances held abroad, which was previously concentrated mainly upon London, has since been diverted to-New York; and the result has been that the United States has lost gold, principally to France, on a very large scale. In the last quarter of 1981, 487 million dollars of gold was exported from the United States, principally to France, and this drain has continued in the present year. We need not discuss the question of the causes of this movement, how far it reflects a genuine uneasiness in French financial circles as to the effects of the &quot; reflation.&quot; policy of the United States, [G671] c
with which we deal below: how far it is inspired by a desire on the part of France to leave as little money&apos;as possible in America, exposed to possible confiscation in the event of a repudiation of war debts: or how far it is merely attributable to the general desire of French banks -to be as liquid as possible in a time of financial crisis. The aspect of the movement with which we are primarily concerned is that it must bring us considerably nearer to the limits of France&apos;s capacity to absorb gold.21: In addition to the outflow of gold from the United States there has been another important gold movement of a different character. The people of India, attracted by the higher rupee prices now-obtainable for gold, have sold part of the vast hoards of gold in the form of coin, ornaments, &amp;c, which they have always been known to possess. There has thus been a large-scale movement of gold from India, coming not from bank reserves but from private hoards, which has reached the remarkable figure of over  40 millions. This flow is still continuing, and in view of the vast accumu-lations of gold in Indian private hoards, estimated at upwards of  500 millions, it seems likely to continue for some time, provided that sterling does not rise so far as to reduce seriously the premiumon gold that is now obtainable. The Indian gold efflux has been one of the major factors in sustaining sterling against the continued -withdrawal of foreign balances in recent months. It has also served materially to improve the financial position of India, and has enabled the Indian Government to meet its maturing obligations in January;and in June next without recourse to fresh borrowing. Inasmuch as the greater part of this gold, too, has gone to France, it should also tend in the long run, by exhausting France&apos;s absorbing capacity, to make for a rise of gold prices.(i) American Reflation.22. Another development of great potential importance is the &quot;reflation&quot; policy which is being undertaken in the United States. Three measures have been taken, or are in course of being taken, in pursuit of this policy: (1) the formation of the National Credit Corporation in October 1931, (2) the formation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in January 1932, and (3) the Glass-Steagall Act-amending the Federal Reserve Act, which has just been passed into law. The purpose of the first two measures is to thaw the &quot; frozen credit &quot; position, by enabling sound institutions in a position of temporaryjfinancial difficulty, to obtain loans from the newly-formed corporations. The National Credit Corporation, the capital of which was subscribed by the banking system as a whole, was only partially successful in -achieving this purpose. But the indications are that the Reconstruc-tion Finance Corporation, the capital of which is provided either by the Treasury or under Treasury guarantee, will produce a more powerful effect.23. The American financial authorities were for some time embarrassing-rassed in their endeavours to ease credit conditions by the large outflow of gold to France. Though the gold reserves of the Federal Reserve Bank system are very large, the surplus gold available for meeting a foreign drain was in practice comparatively small, since the law pro-vided that the note issue must be covered either by gold or by &quot;eligible&quot; bills, and the supply of eligible bills, under conditions of trade depression, was very limited. Under these conditions gold was in fact immobilised as cover against the note issue to an extent far -exceeding the statutory minimum of 40 per cent. The Glass-Steagall Act is designed to remedy this situation by permitting United States Government securities to be held as cover against notes. It further increases the facilities for member banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve system. Its principal significance, however, is that it greatly increases the amount of gold available for export, without contracting the note issue, and thereby puts the Federal Reserve system in a position of invulnerable strength against the withdrawal of foreign balances.24. The Federal Reserve Bank authorities are thus now in a position to pursue a policy of cheap crodit, if they choose to do so; and
an indication of their intention to do so is provided by the reduction of New York Rediscount Rate to 3 per cent, on the 25th February. It remains to be seen how far they will push this policy, or how effective it can be in breaking through the deflationary vicious circles that have been established.(j) The Growing Strength of Sterling.25. A recent development which has an important bearing on the world situation is the marked increase in the strength of the pound. During the months that followed our departure from gold, the withdrawal of foreign balances from London continued on a considerable scale. The fact that it was possible not only to meet these withdrawals, without any serious break in sterling, but to accumulate sufficient foreign exchange to repay the Bank of England  50 millions credit which fell due at the end of January, served to restore confidence throughout the world in the funda-mental soundness of the sterling position. During February,, accordingly, a &quot;bull&quot; movement in sterling began to devekrp, which received added impetus from the reduction of Bank Bate from 6 to 5 per cent, on the 18th February. This has already made it possible to repay more than half of the  80 millions Treasury loan which does not fall due until September, and to abolish the restric-tions on exchange dealings which had been imposed at the time, of the suspension of gold payments. The exchanges have now taken a sharp upward turn. In so far as this is due to purely speculative purchases, it is subject, of course, to the possibility of reaction.26. Subject to this reserve, and without discussing the issues of British monetary policy that arise, it may be said that the growing strength of the sterling position opens out the possibility of the following developments : (i) cheaper money and easier credit conditions in Great Britain:(ii) a recovery of the exchange value of the pound:(iii) a gradual revival of Great Britain&apos;s power to lend abroad.both on short and long term.Easier money in Great Britain would be a factor making for higher-prices throughout the world generally, and, in so far as it was effective in this direction, would tend to ease the world situation. In view of the dominating importance of the British market for many primary commodities, it is probable that a rise of the pound would lead to some recovery of gold prices, just as the fall of the pound from gold parity served to depress gold prices. On the other-hand, a rise of the pound would tend to depress prices in Great Britain and other countries on a sterling basis, though this tendency might not be very marked, if the appreciation was moderate and&apos; was accompanied or preceded by conditions of cheap money. The revival of Great Britain&apos;s ability to lend abroad might prove of small avail, so long as there is a general distrust of the position of debtor-countries. But if it was combined with a rising tendency of world prices, it would contribute materially to the relief of the world&apos;s difficulties.27. Taken together, the growing strength of sterling, the inflationary measures of the United States, and the flooding of France with gold serve to create underlying monetary conditions which might allow a substantial upward movement of gold prices if advantage is taken of them. The large Budget deficits which exist both in the United States and France are further factors-tending in the same direction. The crucial question is whether the removal of certain obstacles which previously stood in the way of a rise in gold prices will be followed by constructive developments; of a positive character soon enough or on a large enough scale to-avert the danger of financial catastrophe in Central Europe (see paragraph 19).[6671]
ii.-the  british position.28. In the setting of the world tendencies described above, it -could hardly be expected that the conditions of British industry would be satisfactory, especially as domestic trade activity has been pre-prejudiced by the policy of public economy set on foot to restore Budgetary equilibrium and by the maintenance, until recently, of Bank Rate at G per cent. In the circumstances the degree of activity maintained by British industry is a testimony to the reality of the competitive advantages which we have derived from the depreciation of the pound.29. The figures of the Board of Trade Index of Production are worth examination in this connection : Table 4.Board of Trade Index of Production. (1924 = 100.)*-Group.

(The recovery in coal-mining was largely of a seasonal character.) These are industries which are exposed in especial degree to the influence of foreign competition. In considering the increase in the Index as a whole, it must be borne in mind that building, where there has been a substantial decline in aetivitj&apos;, is not included.30. Although, indeed, the aggregate figures of our export trade ?are disappointing, some of our staple industries have succeeded, as the following table shows, in doing a substantially increased volume of export business, despite the growing difficulties in the way of international trade.

The aggregate figures of British overseas trade in recent months, with comparable figures for previous years, are given in the following table : Table 7.Aggregate Figures of British Overseas Trade.Values ( 000&apos;s). -	Sept.

The export trade as a whole has continued to decline in aggregate value. In volume, on the other hand, according to the Board of Trade calculations, there has been an increase (which may be largely seasonal, however) of about 0 per cent, in the fourth quarter of 1981 as compared with
the third quarter, but a decline of 21 per cent, as compared with the corresponding quarter of 1980. The figures for December and January last suggest that there has latterly been a distinct expan-;sion in volume, which may now be running at a slightly higher level than a year ago.33. Industries are exposed to foreign competition not only in foreign markets but in the home market. In the home market there has been no important set-off to the benefit which unsheltered industries have derived from the fall of the pound, while the Emergency Duties have served to improve their competitive position further. Generally speaking, therefore, the activity of industries exposed to foreign competition has increased materially since our departure from the gold standard. It is this increase in the activity of unsheltered industries which accounts for the recovery in the Board of Trade Index of Production, for sheltered trades and occupations have shown a prevailing tendency to decline.34. These contrasting tendencies are brought out in the following analysis of the Unemployment Insurance statistics : Table 8.Numbers Unemployed in Insured Industries in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The figures for recent months are affected to some extent by the administrative changes in the Unemployment Insurance system: but this does not alter the essential fact, that since our departure from the gold standard there has been a substantial improvement of emplojanent in the textile industries, and a slight improvement in other exporting industries, a slight worsening in other manufacturing industries and a substantial worsening in building and in services (commerce, distribution, transport, hotels and restaurants, &amp;c.). It should be added that there must have been a large reduction in recent months in the employment of domestic servants, male and female, who are outside the scope of the Unemployment Insurance system, so that the increase in unemploy-ment in sheltered occupations must be considerably greater than the above figures suggest.85. The decline in empkwment in the sheltered occupations is partly the result of the public economies of recent months, and partly the deferred result of the reduction of money incomes arising from the prolonged depression.36. At present these two opposing tendencies of diminishing employment in the sheltered occupations, and increasing employment in the unsheltered, are fairly evenly matched. There is some danger that the former may shortly prevail over the latter, since the policy of slowing down public works programmes has probably not, as yet, produced its maximum effect upon employment; while exporting industries may find the advantage which the fall of the pound gave them increasingly neutralized by the operation of exchange restric-tions, quota schemes and higher foreign tariffs. On the other hand, these influences may be outweighed by the recent reduction of Bank Bate, and the possibility of further reductions.
III CONCLUDING  OBSERVATIONS.87. We have already referred, in the first part of our Report, -to the strength of the sterling position. We are satisfied that the dangers of a serious break of sterling (i.e., below the level at which it stood before the present speculative movement began), which have naturally been a main preoccupation of policy in recent months, are definitely passed for the present. Indeed, it is obvious that there is now more cause to apprehend a return to London on an embarrassing-rassing scale of precarious short-term balances from abroad. In our opinion, therefore, it would appear to be both prudent and desirable to persist and, if possible, to carry further by successive stages, the policy of cheaper money initiated by the reduction of the Bank Rate on the 18th February.2.
