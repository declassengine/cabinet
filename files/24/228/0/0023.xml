ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.In submitting our Report we desire to record our thanks to all those who have assisted us in our task.In Malta we found on all sides a most ready desire to facilitate our inquiry. The willingness to place information at our disposal and to co-operate with us in the discussion of the problems involved in the inquiry was of the greatest aid to us in our mission. Prom all members of the Defence and Civil Services, of the clergy, of the political parties and of the general public with whom we were brought into contact, we received every help and courtesy. To the witnesses who appeared before us and to the authors of the many written communications which were submitted, we are indebted for the trouble which they took in formulating their views and the candour and ability with which they expressed them.We desire to express our thanks to General Sir John Du Cane, the late Governor, for placing accommodation in the Palace at Valletta at our disposal and for every kindness and assistance.We owe gratitude to Mr. H. C. Luke, the Lieutenant-Governor, for the aid which he gave and for many arrangements planned for our convenience.To Mr. B. R. Mifsud, Secretary to the Maltese Imperial Govern-ment, we are also grateful for the help which he extended to us. Our thanks are due, in addition, to Mr. R. Strother-Stewart, Legal Adviser to the Governor, and to Dr. P. Pullicino, Treasury Counsel, for their able assistance on legal questions.We would record our thanks to Major A. J. Gatt, of the Royal Malta Artillery, acting Colonial A.D.C. to the Governor, for his unremitting attention to the details of our establishment, and to Mr. E. L. Petrococchino, Chief Clerk in the Office of the Legis-lature, for his sendees in superintending the arrangements in the Tapestry Chamber, in which the public meetings of the Commis-sion were held.Mr. P. P. De Cesare and his staff of stenographers who assisted our Official Reporters in the taking down and transcription of oral evidence acquitted themselves in a manner deserving of every credit. Major E. J. Briffa de Piro, who acted as interpreter when oral evidence was given in Italian, and also translated many documents, accomplished a difficult task with skill and proficiency. We wish also to record our thanks for the work performed for the Commission by Mr. J. Briffa of the Lieutenant-Governor&apos;s Office, and Mr. G. J. Gatt of the Treasury.The cheerfulness and zeal with which the messengers, police and other members of the staff of the Valletta Palace carried out the duties assigned to them in connexion with the Commission deserve great praise.
We must also note our appreciation of the valuable services rendered toy our Official Reporters, Mr. A. J. Cooper and Mr. I. C. Perrott, who accompanied us to Malta, and reported the proceedings with an expedition and efficiency which much facilitated our work. Mr. Perrott, in addition, rendered untiring assistance in the check-ing, custody and circulation of the large quantity of documents submitted to the Commission.Lastly, our special thanks are due to Mr. A. J. Dawe, of the Colonial Office, who was appointed Secretary to the Commission by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Mr. Dawe had pre-viously visited Malta and had become acquainted with the general position. While we were in the Islands and subsequently in London, his work has been unremitting, accurate, and excellent. We think that his courtesy, good humour and ready assistance were appreciated, not only by ourselves, but by all who came in touch with the work of the Commission : qualities which were specially valuable in the inquiry we were entrusted to conduct.Ask with. Walter Egerton. John de Salis.

MALTA ROYAL COMMISSION,  1931.REPORT.TO THE KXNG&apos;S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. May it Please Your Majesty,Your Majesty&apos;s Warrant, bearing date the seventh day of April, 1931, appointed us Commissioners to inquire into the existing political situation in the Island of Malta and to put forward re-commendations as to the steps which can and should be taken for its amelioration.   Our Terms of Reference were as follows :  &quot; To visit Malta and consider ithe existing political situation in the Island; and to make such recommendations as may seem desirable as to the steps which should be taken to deal with it, with special reference to the possibility of re-establish-ing constitutional government.&quot;We now humbly beg leave to submit to Your Majesty the following Report.CHAPTER I.-INTRODUCTORY.We left London, in pursuance of instructions received from the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on Friday, 10th April, arriving in Malta on Sunday, 19th April. By courtesy of the Governor, General Sir John Du Cane, accommodation was provided for us in the Palace at Valletta, and all our public sittings were held in ithe Tapestry Chamber of the Palace, where the Legislative Assembly ordinarily hold their sessions.After meetings with the Governor, the Archbishop-Bishop of Malta, the Head of the Ministry and the leading members of the political parties, ithe Bishop of Gozo and others, the Opening Sitting was held on Wednesday, the 22nd April, when the following preliminary statement was made by the Chairman : &quot; Having now read His Majesty&apos;s Commission, I would add but a few words. As already announced in the Press, the sitting to-day is a formal introduction or &apos; reading in &apos; of the Commissioners, and only one witness will be taken, His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, who has certain documents to pro-duce, and who will be asked a few questions.
2&quot; In order to meet the convenience of witnesses in the pre-paration of their evidence, we have arranged that a meeting to hear evidence from one of the political parties will be held on Friday morning at 10.30. If they are able to proceed, sittings will be continued on Friday afternoon and on Saturday morn-ing. These sittings will toe open to the public. It is hoped that other political parties will be ready with evidence to be heard during next week.&quot; Other bodies or individuals wishing or able to tender evidence should send early notice to Mr. A. J. Dawe, Secretary to the Eoyal Commission, indicating at the same time the nature of the proposed evidence, in order that the Com-missioners may be able to decide whether their evidence will be relevant. I may add that we shall be glad to hear ex-pressions of opinion from representatives of any section of the community which may seem likely to assist our inquiry. It is anticipated that evidence will normally be taken in public but I would desire to make it clear that the Commissioners reserve the right to hold sittings in camera whenever they think fit.&quot; Though we are empowered to call for evidence, if necessary, and an Ordinance in Malta has been issued to that effect, we have every hope that all suitable evidence will be forthcoming voluntarily, and be given with good will. It will greatly assist our inquiry, and, if I may say so, it will, I think, be to the general advantage, if witnesses are not subjected during the course of the inquiry to unreasonable public criticism or comments in the Press or elsewhere for anything they may say, or any opinions they may offer.&quot; How long the inquiry may last I do not attempt to fore-cast. We shall proceed with all possible speed. Inquiry may have to be conducted both in Malta and in England. We have express power to make interim reports, and occasion for the adoption of this course may arise.&quot; There have been rumours or statements that we are heie to attack, or have the preconceived object of attacking, directly or indirectly, institutions, religion, associations of individuals or individuals themselves; in fact, any belief, any institution or any person. Be assured that we have no such intention or object. Our mandate and our aim is to inquire into the working of the Constitution of 1921, and in the result make such proposals as we may think desirable. In that aim we can only hope that all classes, beliefs or associations who have the interest of Malta at heart will afford us the best co-opera-tion within their power and thus assist us in a task not free from difficulties and complications.
&quot; As for ourselves, I would desire to lay special stress on the fact that we approach this inquiry with a completely open mind.&quot; Our efforts will be directed to devote ourselves to it witn impartiality.&quot; Our object is that representative opinions may be fully heard.&quot; Our duty is to advise His Majesty on the position as it appears to us and on the course to be taken in the future.&quot; The ultimate decision will rest with the Imperial Govern-ment.&quot; In conclusion, our earnest hope is that our report may tend to solve recent difficulties and enhance the well-being of our fellow subjects in one of His Majesty&apos;s most cherished and loyal possessions.&quot;At the Opening Sitting formal evidence was given by Mr. H. C. Luke, the Lieutenant-Governor, and thereafter the Commission sat regularly, usually in the mornings, until the last public sitting on the 18th June. There were in all forty public sittings, which lasted altogether 78 horns. At these sittings the evidence was given on oath, and 27 witnesses were examined (vide Appendix A). Two of the witnesses, Dr. B. Mizzi and Father F. Carta, gave evidence in Italian, and three others, Mr. Borg Olivier, Dr. Carlo Mallia and Professor Vassallo, gave evidence partly in Italian but mainly in English. English was used by the remainder of the witnesses. When Italian was used, Major Briffa de Piro acted as interpreter. A verbatim record of the public proceedings of the Commission has been printed and is being issued as a Non-Parliamentary Publication^In addition to the public sittings, the Commission held seventeen sessions in camera in Malta at which seventeen witnesses were examined. Among these witnesses were the Archbishop-Bishop of Malta and the Bishop of Gozo, who were examined together on two occasions, the Lieutenant-Governor, the Head of the Ministry, representatives of the Imperial Services, public officials and others. We also had various informal interviews with the Governor, the Lieutenant-Governor, and a large number of other persons.On Wednesday. 6th May, we visited the Island of Gozo. The journey was made on board H.M.S. Devonshire, by the kind permission of the Command er-in-Ohief, Admiral Sir Ernie Chatfield. The Bishop of Gozo and the local Commissioner, Mr. Tonna Barthet, came to lunch on board, and afterwards we went ashore and returned the Bishop&apos;s call.* Colonial No. 68.
4The Commission visited the Higher Central School, Hamrun, on Monday, ISth May, the Girhs Elementary School, Floriana, on Thursday, 11th June, and St. Aloysius&apos; College and St. Edward&apos;s College on Monday, 22nd June. The Commission also inspected the Notarial Archives on Friday, 5th June. In addition, individual and informal visits were paid to various public institutions, including hospitals, and the Public Library and the Museum in Valletta. On the afternoon of Wednesday, 3rd June, Your Majesty&apos;s Birth-day, the Commission gave an &quot; At Home &quot; at the Palace, which was attended by a large gathering of nearly 760 persons.Two of us left Malta on the 24th and the other on the 26th June. On our return to London we held further sessions in camera, at which we took evidence from Sir John Du Cane, Sir Samuel Wilson, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, and Sir Thomas Best, formerly Lieutenant-Governor of Malta. We also had an informal interview with Sir John Risley, formerly Legal Adviser to the Colonial Office. The three Service Departments in London were given the opportunity of offering evidence before the Commission : but as the Commission did not propose to recommend any restriction of the sphere allotted to the Imperial authorities under the 1921 Constitution, they did not find it necessary to avail themselves of it.In addition to oral evidence, we received a very considerable number of communications from all sections of the community. These included over 470 Memoranda and 50 Resolutions. To assist us in our task we were furnished with copies of correspondence, both open and confidential, between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governor respecting  he Malta crisis of 1930. We have studied a variety of Parliamentary and other State Papers on the subject of Malta, and have also perused numerous pamphlets and similar publications on Maltese questions which have appeared in recent years.Scope of Inquiry.The problem into which we were instructed to inquire raised issues of -difficulty and delicacy, and we would desire to preface this Report with some indication of its scope and of the spirit in which we have approached it.   It falls into three main phases.First, there were the aspects which had become the subject of diplomatic action. These pertained to the divergencies between Your Majesty&apos;s Government and the Holy See dealt with in the correspondence laid before Parliament over a year ago.*  The issues* &quot;Correspondence with the Holy See relative to Maltese Affairs&quot; (Cmd. 3588).
raised here transcended the local affairs of a small island. We found it impossible to exclude them from a consideration of the constitutional problems which formed the more specific object of our inquiry. In this sphere it was necessary to study the question of the relations between Church and State. The delicacy of our duty in this direction requires no emphasis. The history of Western Europe is deeply rooted in the controversies which have arisen on these matters. They touch questions of individual conscience and belief which raise them beyond (the political sphere. The problem was one which had to be examined primarily from the standpoint of conditions in Malta. To understand that position, it was neces-sary to look below the surface and to examine with sympathetic appreciation the traditions and beliefs which give Malta its separate individuality in the general political combination to which the Island belongs. In attempting to formulate views upon this question, it was equally necessary to take into account opinions existing in the widely different atmosphere of Great Britain.The second was the constitutional phase. Here we had to examine the break-down in the Constitution and to con-sider how a regular form of government could best be re-instituted. This part of the problem raised a variety of legal issues. The Con-stitution of 1921 was a complicated mechanism. The functions of the two sides of the Dyarchy had had to be dovetailed into one another in written constitutional instruments. The necessity for exact legal definition provided a fertile field for dispute. This, we were early to discover, had been fully exploited in a country where the politicians combined in a marked degree the gift both for litigation and for party recrimination. A complex series of legal matters was therefore brought under our consideration. Some of these had formed the subject of appeals to the Privy Council and also involved general and not unimportant questions of constitutional law. Much of the evidence put before us dealt with these matters and they were argued at length and with a variety of detail. Before we could frame our recommendations regarding the political future of the Island, they called for prolonged and careful examination.The third phase may be said to be the political side of the Malta question in its Imperial aspects. We had to consider the problem as affecting the relations between Great Britain and a Dependency to which a measure of self-government had been given; and to examine the question whether from the Imperial standpoint it was desirable to make any reforms in the Constitution of the Island, and if so what those reforms should be, and by what methods they should be effected. Here again it was not practicable to look at the matter merely on its local merits as might have been the case if we had been dealing with, for example, a West Indian Colony. The position of Malta is a special one. The Island has a significance to the Empire out of proportion to its geographical extent, the number
of its population, or its material resources. It possesses one of the finest harbours in the Mediterranean. It is not only a naval base of the first importance rto the local position of the British Navy in that area; it is also a vital link in the general chain of Imperial com-munications stretching through the Suez Canal to India, Australasia and the Far East. In a consideration of the constitu-tional future of the Island full weight had to be given to these factors.A simple question regarding the best form of government for a small island is one on which recommendations could have been framed with relative ease, especially having regard to the wealth of experience and examples which the British Empire provides in these matters. The Malta question could not, however, be reduced to these elementary terms. It involved, as we have indicated, questions of high policy of an Imperial and diplomatic character.In the evidence taken in Malta a variety of matters were put before us. The majority of them were brought forward by party politicians and dealt with from a partisan standpoint. They were argued often with a passionate advocacy, and almost invariably with an abundance of detail. Our Terms of Reference were, how-ever, widely drawn, and we did not think it desirable to restrict too closely the freedom allowed to witnesses. It was part of our task to consider the general fitness of the Maltese for self-govern-ment : and apart altogether from the subject matter of the evidence, it was from this standpoint instructive to us to observe the manner in which political questions were treated, and the general tone in which they were discussed.Evidence taken in such conditions was clearly liable to obscure in a cloud of detail the real issues before us. We have, therefore, since our return endeavoured, in the atmosphere of detachment which is more possible in this country, to i&apos;eview very carefully the mass of evidence and documents which were put before us, and to submit as far as possible to the test of fact the contentions urged by the local political parties.Arrangement of Report.It may be desirable to say a word as to the plan of our Report. We were invited by our Terms of Reference to &apos;&apos; consider the exist-ing political situation in the Island.&quot; To do this we found it necessary to examine historically and in some detail the political events which have occurred in the Island since the advent to office of the Strickland Ministry in 1927. After brief reference to the earlier history of the Constitution, we have felt it necessary to recapitulate at some length the series of legal questions which
arose regarding the representation in the &apos; Senate of the Trade Union Council. Interconnected with these are questions of con-stitutional importance regarding the validity of certain Acts of the Legislature. It has also been necessary to set out in historical sequence the main developments in the dispute with the ecclesiastical authorities which centred round the Pastoral Letter, issued on the 1st May, 1930, and the other events which led up to the suspension of the Constitution in the following July. An account of these matters necessarily involves some tedious and often technical recapitulation. The conclusions which we formed on the various subjects before us, together with oar main recommendation, will be found grouped in the last chapter of the Report.The Report which we now submit to Your Majesty and the recommendations it contains are the results of an extended study of the Maltese situation. It is our hope that they may commend themselves to the favourable consideration of Your Majesty&apos;s Government.CHAPTEE II.-DESCRIPTIVE AND HISTORICAL.General Description.Malta, as has been frequently stated, is about the size of the Isle of Wight, with a population nearly the same as that of Portsmouth and Southsea, or Catania in Sicily. With its adjacent islands of Gozo and Comino, it has about a quarter of the popula-tion of Glasgow and less than the population of Nottingham. According to the 1931 Census, Malta has 234,563 people, of whom 217,784 form the civil population, and Gozo has 23,837 people, all civilians. In spite of its small size, it is a State in a large Empire, to which it has proved itself to be emphatically loyal.Malta itself offers a varied picture. The north-east coast is dominated by the city of Valletta, with its suburbs and har-bours and a few other towns and villages extending on the north to St. Paul&apos;s Bay, where the Apostle St. Paul is traditionally believed to have been wrecked. Near the centre of the Island, on the slopes of a ridge running through it, stands the ancient capital, Mdina, later known as Citta Vecchia and Notabile, so named because Alfonso I of Aragon in the fourteenth century is said to have called it the most notable jewel of his Crown. In the same house where Alfonso stayed the heiress of the noble family of Inguanez, by whom he was entertained, now lives. Its Cathedral and the re-mains of the moats and ramparts testify to the importance of Notabile in the past. This city is an illustration of the history of Malta and the long inherited record which the Maltese cherish.
this record can be traced by even the cursory tourist when he sees the buildings of the Knights of St. John, St. Angelo with its Norman remains, the recently discovered tombs of the Saracens, the villas of the Romans and the maze of catacombs used by the earliest Christians. The record reaches back through countless years even to the ruts in the rock of the neighbouring hills, which, according to Professor Sir Themistocles Zammit, were probably caused in prehistoric times by the carriage, possibly on sleighs manually worked, of washed-down earth back from the valleys in order to restore soil to the fields of the ridge.Notabile looks down upon a chess board of small fields, hedged by high stone walls, reaching to the ramparts of Valletta. In their midst lies the town of Musta, noted for the large dome of its church. On the slopes where Notabile stands the most notice-able features are Verdala&quot;Palace, formerly the summer residence of the Grand Masters, the Grand Inquisitor&apos;s house, a church and a signalling station. Beyond to the west there are chiefly rocky lands, every yard of which, wherever sufficient soil can be lodged, is cultivated. Some of the inhabitants of this coast live in caves cut out in bygone days in the face of the cliffs. Further to the south is the uninhabited island of Filfla, used by the Navy as a target for practice and bombardments under smoke screens.Valletta, the capital, largely dependent on the Pleet and Garri-son for its prosperity, has, including its immediate suburbs, a civilian population of 55,439, but if its outer circle of only three miles radius from Valletta gate is added, this number is increased to no less than 147,693, so closely is the population packed round the city and its two harbours. This figure leaves only 70,091 for the rest of the Island, and of this remainder 10,032 are congregated in Notabile and 5,251 in Musta.Valletta and its inner suburbs, clustering round its magnificent harbours, only increased in population by 1,976 in the inter-censal period, 1921-1931. The outer suburbs, within the three miles radius, increased by 17,976. The increase in the civilian popula-tion of Malta in the period 1921-1931 amounted to 28,087 or an average of 2,808 per annum. In addition to the civilian population, the Census recorded a Naval, Military and Air Force personnel of 16,617 and 162 passengers and crews of merchant shipping. Gozo and Comino, with a purely agricultural and fishing community, have increased in population by 1,276 persons during the last ten years.Of the people of the Islands the very large proportion are Maltese. During the last century the population has more than doubled and, as indicated above, it is now growing at a net average increase of nearly three thousand a year.   During recent years emigration has
been largely reduced, and indeed emigrants have been returning from the United States and Australia. If it were not for the high infantile mortality, the population, in view of the large families, would increase at a still more rapid rate.The Islands are remarkable for their palaeolithic and neolithic remains, which have been examined, so far as funds and opportunities -ties have allowed, by the efforts of Sir T. Zammit in the neolithic and Professor Giuseppe Despott in the palaeolithic departments of ancient history.The Maltese all agree in an intense love for their Island, and those who have emigrated frequently return and buy small plots of ground. They are also united in the fact that almost all speak Maltese and generally use that language in their homes, although the educated classes also use the English and Italian languages.Malta, as the foregoing remarks may in some small degree illustrate, presents a diversity of conditions. The Island lay in the main pathway of the ancient civilisations, and as they rose or fell they left varying traces of their influence. The problems which face the Island to-day have their roots in a complex past; and to understand them it is necessary to approach them with a sympathetic insight into their historical background. It was our endeavour to consider in this light the matters which were put before us.The Earlier Constitutions.It would be almost possible to plot a graph of the constitutional history of Malta- during the last hundred years showing the rise and fall of Constitutions modelled alternately on the principle of benevolent autocracy and that of representative government. From time to time some measure of self-government was granted and then, after a period, superseded by a strict Crown Colony system.In 1SS7 a Constitution on the representative model was granted by Letters Patent. A Council of Government was set up, com-posed of six official and fourteen elected members. Money votes were to be decided by the elected members only, and could only be introduced by the Governor or on his express sanction. Certain elected members on nomination by the Governor were to sit on the Executive Council. The scheme was liberal in idea but as a method of government had serious defects. The legislative and executive control was divided. The elected members were given power without responsibility. They could dislocate the machinery of government without being called upon to form an alternative Government and themselves undertake responsibility. 12158 B
The elected members appear frequently to have exploited their position for the purposes of political agitation, without regard for the practical requirements of administration, while the Governor and his officials had to carry out as best they could the functions of government. Reserved powers had to be continually called into play to overcome the opposition of the unofficial element, and, in the last resort, Imperial Orders in Council. The exercise of these overriding powers generally enabled the Constitution to be worked in a practical manner, and gave to the elected members the oppor-tunity to throw out measures for the purposes of political window-dressing, with the full knowledge that the Imperial authorities would intervene and that no administrative confusion would be allowed to result from their actions. Thus, in 1903, the elected members rejected the Education Estimates owing to the Govern-ment refusal to abolish the free choice by the parents of the language to be taught to their children in the schools. Mr. Chamberlain, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, decided that the time had come for a change. A new Constitution was set up of the more strict Crown Colony type, with an official majority in the legislative body. The elected members of the Council of Government were reduced to eight and the official members were increased to ten.From 1903 onwards the elected members devoted themselves almost entirely to protests against the new form of government. They largely refrained from taking part in the work of legislation or administration. They also abstained from attendance at the Council of Government except for an occasional appearance to register a protest. In the Press and on the platform outside they devoted themselves to incessant agitation and denounced every measure of government in violent terms. It was to this agitation that in 1919 the riots of that year owed their anti-British character.The Riots of 1919.The causes which led up to the disturbances were many and complex. The origin of the trouble was chiefly economic. In Malta, as elsewhere, in the immediate post-war period, economic difficulties provided a field for political exploitation. The high price of food and cost of living together with an increase in the number of unemployed, produced a feeling of discontent among the poorer classes. Unrest was fomented by political agitation and aggravated by certain grievances alleged by the students of the University. This latter factor gave the impression that dissatisfaction-tion in the Island was general and not merely confined to the working classes.On Saturday and Sunday, 7th and 8th June, 1919, the discontent culminated in disorders, which were accompanied by a marked
display of anti-British feeling. On the Saturday a meeting of the Assembly was held, at which a petition to the Secretary of State for a change of Constitution was put forward. On the same afternoon serious rioting and looting occurred in Valletta. The police were unable to cope with the position, and the Acting Governor, Major-General Hunter Blair, was obliged to instruct the military to intervene. Firing resulted in three deaths and eight other casual-ties among the civilians. No soldiers were killed, and as soon as possible the military were withdrawn. It eventually became neces-sary to land a party of marines and sailors from the Fleet to establish order.At the time when these occurrences took place General Sir Herbert (shortly afterwards Field-Marshal Lord) Plumer was on his way to the Island to take up his new appointment as Governor. He assumed the administration on the 10th June. One of his first acts was to issue a Proclamation reviewing the facts of the disturbance and reminding the Islanders that it was their duty to do everything in their power to assist him and the authori-ties in all measures taken for the protection of life and property and the maintenance of order. A Commission of Inquiry into the events of the 7th and Sth June and the circumstances which led up to them was constituted on the 12th August and was composed of the Senior Judge of the Maltese High Court, the Vice-president of the Chamber of Advocates, a local Magistrate and two officers of the Imperial Forces. The proceedings of this body, were however, soon overshadowed by political events of which the outcome was to be the grant of self-government.The Meetings of the National Assembly.The ideas regarding the rights of small communities, which were intensified by the War, were not without their effect on Malta. A stirring of political consciousness resulted, soon after the Armistice, in the calling together of a National Assembly. The promoter of this movement was Dr. (afterwards Sir) Filippo Sceberras. The Assembly, which was constituted on the 25th February, 1919, was composed of representatives of all classes, professions and organised sections of opinion. Political demands were promulgated, but the June riots appear to have calmed the more extreme sections, who were surprised at the length to which events had gone, and after these disturbances then attitude became more moderate.One of the first steps taken by Lord Plumer, after his assump-tion of office, was to intimate that he would be glad to receive a reasoned statement of the constitutional changes which the Maltese desired.   The National Assembly, which provided the only unofficial1245s B 2
organ of political self-expression, met accordingly in August, under the presidency of Dr. Sceberras, and submitted a draft Constitution.The draft, which was worked out with care, provided for respon-sible self-government in local affairs, the question of Imperial affairs or interests being, in the case of disagreement between the Governor and his Cabinet, left to the discretion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Executive was to consist of a civil Governor and a Cabinet of seven Ministers, the Legislature being composed of two Houses. There was to be a Chamber of Deputies of twenty-two members, elected by all males (subject to certain rules of eligibility) who had reached the age of 21 and could read and write, or paid a rent or enjoyed an unearned income of not less than  5 a year. There was to be a Senate of twelve, elected from among higher ecclesiastics, graduates, professional men, members of the Chamber of Commerce, ex-Members of the Chamber of Deputies and persons enjoying an unearned income of over  100 a year, or paying  50 in rent. The electorate for this body was to consist of all persons who were qualified to vote for the election of members of the first Chamber and who could read and write.Mr. Amery&apos;s Visit.In view of the disquieting position in the Island, both as regards political unrest and as regards the condition of its finances, the late Lord Milner, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, decided to send a representative from the Colonial Office to investigate on the spot and to confer with the Governor as to the best way of improving the situation.Mr. Amery, then Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, undertook this mission and visited the Island in September. By this time the excitement which had attended the disturbances in June had subsided and it was possible to make a calm survey of the situation. The result of Mr. Amery&apos;s discussions with Lord Plumer and the local official and unofficial elements was a recom-mendation to the Home Government that a measure of self-government should be granted to Malta.This recommendation was approved by the Imperial Government and was announced by Mr. Amery in the House of Commons on the 19th November, 1919, in reply to a question by Mr. Omisby Gore. The announcement was as follows : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that the time has come to entrust the people of Malta with full responsible control of their purely local affairs, the control of the Naval and Military Services and of such other services and functions
of Government as are connected with the position of Malta as an Imperial fortress and harbour remaining vested in the Imperial authorities. Some time will necessarily be involved in working out the details of the proposed Constitution and in clearing up some of the more urgent financial and administra-tive problems created by the War, and I shall at a later date have to come to the House for a measure of assistance to the finances of the Island, which have been seriously embarrassed by circumstances arising out of the War and the subsequent reduction of the garrison and dockyaixl. I hope, however, that it may be possible to dispose of all these matters in the course of the next year and to enable the new system of local self-government to come into force at the beginning of 1921 &quot;.The decision of the Imperial Government to entrust the people of Malta with full responsibility for the control of their purely local affairs evoked enthusiasm in Malta. Lord Plumer telegraphed to Lord Milner on the 25th November, reporting that he had an-nounced the decision at a special meeting of the Council of Govern-ment. The news, he stated, had been received by the population with profound satisfaction and demonstrations of joy and loyalty. A large crowd had assembled in front of the Valletta Palace and bands played the National Anthem amid cheering for the King.On the same date the President of the Maltese National Assembly sent a telegram to the Secretary of State which expressed the gratitude of the local population. &quot; Malta &quot;, said the President, &quot; received the happy and auspicious announcement of grant of self-government writh feelings of boundless joy which found ex-pression in a spontaneous and most imposing popular demonstra-tion of love and loyalty to the Mother Country and of respect and gratitude to His Majesty&apos;s Government and Lord Plumer amidst the most enthusiastic cheers for their beloved King, the strains of the National Anthem sung by thousands of loyal hearts, and the flutter of the glorious British Flag side by side with the national Colours &quot;.Evolution of the 1921 Constitution.These preliminary rejoicings were succeeded by a detailed and somewhat tedious correspondence regarding the exact terms in which the decision of the Imperial Government was to be embodied in appropriate constitutional instruments. A period of two years was to elapse before the new Constitution was set up as a working system.The details of the new Constitution, which, from its nature, were of a complicated character, required much thought and considera-tion. In a despatch dated the 24th December, 1919, Lord Milner, however, was able to indicate the general outlines of the proposed
scheme of reform. The draft Constitution approved by the National Assembly had recognised that there were in Malta Imperial inter-ests which must necessarily be placed outside the province of the new local Administration. Lord Milner&apos;s despatch was chiefly directed to sketching the general principles on which this novel Constitution would have to be based. &quot; It is essential &quot;, he wrote, in the interests of both parties concerned, that the respective spheres of the Imperial and local authorities in Malta should be clearly defined, and that neither in administration nor in legislation should there be any confusion between the functions which each should exercise, or any doubt as to the responsibility devolving upon them &quot;. The actual definition of matters of Imperial con-cern would require to be settled with great care. It was obvious that the machinery of government required to deal with these matters would have to be clearly separated from the local Govern-ment responsible to the Maltese electorate. &quot; There will, in fact &quot;, continued Lord Milner, &quot; have to be two concurrent systems of government in the Island : a Government for matters of Imperial concern, which must take orders from the Imperial Government, and a Government for local affairs, which will be controlled by the wishes of the inhabitants of the Island, expressed through popular institutions &quot;.Lord Milner, in his despatch, did not overlook the demand, en-dorsed by the National Assembly, that under the new regime the Governor should be a civilian. He considered that, with a clear definition between the Imperial and local aspects of the Governors duties, the reason which had led to the demand would cease to have any force. He proposed that the matter should continue to be left to the discretion of the Imperial Government.The translation of these principles into appropriate legal form necessarily took time. It was not until the 28th May, 1920, that Lord Milner was able to transmit to Lord Plumer the drafts of the necessary legal instruments, with a request that they should be published in order to elicit the views of all sections of the Maltese community. The Maltese availed themselves to the full of this opportunity for comment, and on the 23rd September, 1920, Lord Plumer forwarded to the Secretary of State a number of memoranda putting forward a large variety of suggested amendments.It was then necessary for Lord Milner to examine how far it was possible to embody these suggestions in the new Constitution, and also to consult the various Departments of His Majesty &apos;s Government that were concerned with the reservation of matters affecting Imperial interests. In April, 1921, however, the Colonial Office were able to transmit to the Governor the legal instruments which had been enacted to provide for the establishment of the new Constitution.
The Constitution of 1921.The salient feature of the Constitution of 1921* was that it was based upon the dyarchical principle. The object was to give the Maltese people real and complete responsibility for the conduct, both by legislation and by administration, of their own local affairs. There was, however, an area of matters arising out of the position of Malta as a strategical centre of vital importance, which were of Imperial concern. These matters were to be reserved to the Im-perial Government in as complete a manner as local interests were to be handed over to the Maltese Legislature and Executive. Two distinct Governments were set up in the Island, each clothed with legislative and executive power within its defined sphere. The &quot; Maltese Government &quot; was responsible to a Legislature, consisting of an Assembly and Senate, constituted on a represen-tative basis, while the &quot; Maltese Imperial Government &quot;, which worked both legislatively and executively within the larea of &quot; reserved matters &quot;, was vested in a Governor, who was subject to the instructions of Your Majesty&apos;s Government.The method by which the differentiation of responsibility was achieved in the framing of the Constitution was that of granting to the Maltese general powers of responsible self-government for all purposes, subject to certain reservations set out in Section 41 (1) of the Constitution Letters Patent. These Letters Patent were accompanied by concurrent Letters Patent constituting the office of Governor, and under Clause 12 of the latter the Governor was empowered to make by Ordinance laws with regard to the matters reserved from the local Legislature. The matters reserved to the ImiDerial authorities were described in general terms in Section 41 (1) of the Letters Patent as matters touching the public safety and defence of the Empire and the general interests of Your Majesty&apos;s subjects not resident in Malta. Without prejudice to this general reservation certain subjects were particularly specified as &quot; reserved matters &quot;. These related to matters of defence or to matters in which the foreign relations of the Empire or trade and communica-tion between its component parts were concerned. The most important of them were the control and discipline of the Naval, Military and Air forces; the defence of the Island; the control and regulation of aerial navigation and aircraft; surveys for Naval, Military and Air Eorce purposes; submarine cables and wireless, telegraphy and telephony; coinage and currency; emigration; naturalization of aliens; posts and telegraphic censorship ; the issue of visas and passports; and treaties or any relations with foreign States except so far as local legislation was necessary to enable effect to be given within the Island to any treaty.* In view of the technical and complicated nature of the Constitution, the full texts of the Legal Instruments on which it is based are printed for the convenience of the reader as Appendix C to this Report.
It is important to note that, in virtue of the general reservation mentioned above, any matters other than those particularly speci-fied could be brought within the reserved sphere when the interests of the public safety and defence of the Empire became, involved.Opening of the Legislature by The Prince of Wales.The Prince of Wales opened the Maltese Legislature on the 1st November, 1921. During the two previous days the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly had been duly elected and both Houses of the Legislature had been sworn in.On the day preceding His Royal Highness&apos;s arrival, Monday, the 31st October, the establishment of the new Constitution was celebrated by a solemn religious service held in St. John&apos;s Church, at which the Archbishop-Bishop officiated. The service was attended by the Governor, the Lieutenant-Governor, Members of both Houses of the Legislature and the leading officials.The ceremony of the opening of the Legislature was carried out in the Palace of Valletta. His Royal Highness, in his inaugural address, referred to the confidence in the loyalty of the people and in their ability to administer the affairs of their country shown by Your Majesty in granting to them responsible government. &quot; Re-spousible government &quot;, His Royal Highness continued, &quot; not only gives power to the representatives of the people but also imposes upon them a responsible trust for the good of their fellow men and for the future &quot;. He dwelt upon the difficulties which would in-inevitably face the new local Government and the qualities which would be required in dealing with them. &quot; The history of Malta &quot;, he went on, &quot; shows that the people possess these qualities, and I am confident that they will be forthcoming now. I am confident, because the Maltese have ever clung closely to their religion and the faith of their fathers and have trust and confidence in the good-ness and mercy of Almighty God &apos;&apos;.The inauguration of the new Legislature and other functions connected with the Prince&apos;s visit were a great success. The warmest reception was accorded to His Royal Highness by all classes of the population, and the visit undoubtedly did much to fuse into affection for the Crown the goodwill already created by the grant of the Constitution and by the work done by Lord Plumer in the preceding two years.
The Political Parties.The main origin of the political parties which have grown up under the parliamentary regime is to be found in the National Assembly of 1919. At the time of the dissolution of the Assembly live political groups had assumed definite shape. They were as follows :  (1) The Unione Politica Party sometimes called the Panzavecchian Party from the name of its leader, Mgr. Panzavecchia;(2) The National Democratic Party led by Dr. Enrico Mizzi, son of Dr. Fortunato Mizzi, a former colleague of Mgr. Panzavecchia;(3) The Anglo-Maltese Party, a group formed by Sir Gerald Strickland, who had returned to the political life of the Island on the conclusion of his career as a Colonial Governor;(4) The Constitutional Party led by Professor Augustus Bartolo;(5) The Labour Party led by Lieutenant-Colonel William Savona.There appears to have been little difference between the aims of the Anglo-Maltese and the Constitutional Parties; and shortly before the elections for the new Legislature these two parties were fused into one group under the leadership of Sir Gerald Strickland and the title of the Constitutional Party. There were thus four parties whose programmes were put before the electorate when, in October, 1921, for the first time in their history, the Maltese were called upon to elect a Legislature from which a responsible government was to be constituted.The result of the election for the Legislative Assembly was that the Unione Politica Party gained fourteen seats, the Constitutional Party seven, Dr. Mizzi&apos;s Party four, and the Labour Party seven. In the Senate the Unione Politica Party had a majority over all other parties.Though in point of numbers the strongest party in the Assembly, the Unione Politica Party would have been outnumbered by a combination of the three other groups, and therefore required support from outside its own ranks. This support they obtained from the Labour Party. The first Ministry was formed by Mr. Joseph Howard from among the representatives of the Unione Politica Party, and it held office until April, 1922.In that month a coalition was formed with the Labour Party, two representatives from the Labour group being appointed to the
Ministry. This collaboration continued until the end of 1922, when the leaders of the Labour Party decided that their representatives should withdraw from office, and remain independent. They con-sented, however, to extend support to the Ministry except when questions of principle were involved.The second General Election took place in June, 1924, and a Legislative Assembly composed as follows was returned : Unione  Politica  Party,  ten;  Constitutional  Party,  ten; Labour Party, seven; National Democratic Party, five.The Unione Politica Party thus lost four seats, while the Con-stitutional Party and the National Democratic Party had gained three and one respectively.A Ministry drawn from the Unione Politica Party again took office with Dr. F. Buhagiar as Plead of the Ministry, but the Government were defeated on a proposal to fix Ministers&apos; salaries by law. Dr. Buhagiar then made an agreement with the National Democratic Party which provided for their support contingent on the appointment to the Ministry of two members from that group. These two members were Dr. Enrico Mizzi, who became Minister for Posts and Agriculture, and Professor Carlo Mallia, who became Minister for Industry and Commerce.The amalgamated groups became known as the Nationalist Party, and will henceforward be referred to under that name.In September, 1924, Dr. Buhagiar retired from office on his appointment to be a judge. The Ministry was then reconstituted with Dr. (later, Sir) Ugo Mifsud at its head, a post which he re-tained until the Nationalist Government was defeated at the General Election of August, 1927.The Nationalist Administrations.The Nationalists, as indicated above, came into office in November, 1921, and after the General Election of 1924 again returned to office, remaining there for a further triennial period from June, 1924, to August, 1927. During these years the Con-stitution, in spite of the novelty and complexity of its machinery, appears to have worked with little friction.The Nationalist Party may be said broadly to have represented the conservative element in the Island. It was the party which the educated and professional classes tended to support. It in-herited the traditions of the groups which had upheld the demands of the Maltese for wider constitutional liberties and consequently would desire to show that the Maltese were capable of working the
Constitution which had been granted to them, and that the Con-stitution was an advantage to the Islands.In this endeavour the Nationalist Governments seemed the passage of Acts for the protection of women and children workers, for the grant of pensions to widows and orphans of government employees, for the provision of modem and hygienic dwellings for the working classes, and for the restriction of rents. They also pur-sued a prudent financial policy by setting aside in 1925 a Eeserve Fund of  50,000 to meet any future contingencies of an extra-ordinary nature, and making provision for annual additions to this Fund until a total of  100,000 should be reached.During the six years of Nationalist administration there does not appear to have been more than one case of serious friction between Ministers and the Imperial authorities. This incident occurred in connexion with the enactment of an Ordinance by the Governor, in the exercise of his reserved powers, dealing with military training in the Island, and reached its acute point in the early part of 1927. The Ordinance subjected private property to certain restrictions and servitudes in the interests of military training, and when it was published in draft form exception was taken to it by Ministers, who contended that legislation of such a character ought to be enacted by the Maltese Legislature, and not by an Ordinance. Dr. Ugo Mifsud, then Head of the Ministry, and his colleagues expressed themselves as ready to propose legislation on the sub-ject in the local Legislature, while the Imperial authorities maintained that the matter was a reserved one, that under the provisions of the Constitution the Legislature was not competent to deal with it, and that the power of legislation on such a subject resided in the Governor. This difference of view between the two sides of the Dyarchy gave rise to considerable controversy. A certain amount of public agitation was created and heated ex-pressions were used in the Press, in which the measure was de-nounced as an outrage on the rights of the Maltese under the Con-stitution of 1921. Eventually the Imperial authorities, while maintaining their position that the right of legislation on the matter lay with the Governor, enacted an amendment to the Ordinance which removed it from the field of political dispute.Apart from this incident, harmonious relations appear to have been maintained between the two sides of the Dyarchy. Ministers seem to have shown a readiness to make arrangements on disputed points, and to have displayed that desire for co-operation which was essential to the working of the Constitution.After these brief preliminary remarks we turn to the events which led up to the political crisis with which our inquiry was immediately concerned.
CHAPTER   III. THE    CONSTITUTIONAL    PARTY   in power.Difficulties with the Senate.The Strickland Ministry takes Office-Feeling between theParties.On the 20th June, 1927, both Houses of the Legislature were dissolved, and an election was held in the first days of August, the Constitutional Party, supported by the Labour Party, having at its close a small majority in the Legislative Assembly. The elec-tions had been conducted with some fervour; and an unpleasant in-cident had occurred owing to a widely circulated affidavit sworn by one Ettore Bono, nicknamed &quot; Terinu,&quot; in which Sir Gerald Strickland was stated to be a freemason. It did not appear in the affidavit that Ettore Bono was the same person as &quot; Terinu,&quot; a man known throughout Malta as a person of disrepute, who is said to have had 62 convictions against him. The affidavit was distributed throughout the Islands and without doubt had con-siderable effect upon many of the electors. Further, the circum-stances under which it was sworn before the Public Prosecutor at the official residence of the Head of the Ministry and, it was said, in the presence of Sir Ugo Mifsud, the leader of that party, gave rise to charges that it was an authorised production of the Nationalist Party. Sir Ugo Mifsud .was in the building at the time but in his evidence denied on oath that he knew anything about the swearing of the affidavit or the payment of the stamp fee thereon, and he stated that he had not allowed copies to be brought into the headquarters of the party. Bono, who is now deceased, was tried for perjury and convicted.In spite of the circulation of copies of this affidavit, the Con-stitutional Party obtained a majority in the Legislative Assembly, and Sir Ugo Mifsud tendered his resignation on the 14th August. The Governor thereupon entrusted Sir Gerald Strickland, as leader of the Constitutional Party, with the duty of forming a new administration.Another incident then occurred which increased the feeling be-tweeii the parties. Orders were given by the new Government for a search to be made of the houses of Sir Ugo Mifsud and Dr. Mifsud Bonnici, lately Ministers, and of Dr. Mifsud Bonnici&apos;s fiancee, for government documents which it was alleged the Ministers had taken from their offices. It was said that a similar action had been taken after the election of 1924 by the raiding of the offices of the Constitutional Party in the endeavour to discover evidences of bribery, when nothing had been found.
The Trade Union Council Cases.Although Sir Gerald Strickland had a majority in the Legisla-tive Assembly, he could not claim a majority in the Senate; and some of the main difficulties in the subsequent history of the Ministry arose from the question of membership of the Senate and the resultant legal cases.The first of these legal cases began at an early date, the un-contested election of the two Trade Union Senators, members of the Constitutional Party, Colonel William Savona and Mr. Michelangelo Borg, to represent the Trade Union Council in the Senate, being announced on the 19th September and at once impugned.It would appear that a list of the names of the delegates repre-senting the Unione Cattolica San Giuseppe on the Trade Union Council had been published by.Government Notice No. 93 on the 11th March, 1927. On the 9th August Sir Ugo Mifsud showed the Governor a new panel which the Governor approved, without his attention being called to a protest by Armando Mifsud in which the said Mifsud claimed that it was untrue that the first eight delegates had resigned from the Unione and that he, the ninth, had been expelled, since he had not resigned and had refused to resign. He also alleged that his name had been cancelled from a list of members, on which he was entitled by Government Kegula-tions to remain until the 31st December, 1928, at an irregularly convened sitting held on the 27th June, when only seven members out of 32 were present, without any reasonable cause made known to him and without his having been heard. He also said that at a sitting on the 30th June the Council had held that he was still a lawful member and had so duly informed the Committee of the Unione, and that on the 8th July he started a lawsuit to defend his rights. Sir Ugo Mifsud stated in his evidence that he was never made aware, directly or indirectly, officially or privately, of any lawsuit when, on the 9th August, the Governor had approved the new panel arranged at the meeting of the 27th June. He said he had never heard of it until the autumn of 1927, and then only informally and vaguely.On the same day, the 9th August, on which by Government Notice No. 303, the names of the new representatives of the Unione were recognized, a writ was issued to the returning officer of the Trade Union Council for the election of two special members in the new Senate, the date of election being fixed for the 16th August. The date on the writ was extended, at the request of the Council, to the 25th August, the 16th and
17th being fixed for the nominations, the 19th for the publication of the names of candidates in the Government Gazette, and the 24th and 25th for voting.Revocation of Regulations made under the Natonalist&quot; Regime.On the day proposed for nominations, the 16th August, the new Ministry under Sir Gerald Strickland took office. On that day the Governor in Council, that is to say, the Governor acting on the advice of Ministers, by Government Notice No. 323, immediately revoked the Regulations published on the 30th September, 1926, to constitute a new Trade Union Council, annulled all that had been done by virtue thereof and notified that the Trade Union Council existing prior to the 30th September, 1926, had again been recognized.An explanation given to us of this matter was that &quot; political appointments could not be made to the Trade Union Council, and the Societies that were merely Benefit Societies were not entitled to representation on that Council, especially when Societies were created by clerical organizations to swamp Societies of bona fide workers by faggot votes. In the new Trade Union Council (of the 16th August) certain Benefit Societies were excluded before the nomination of candidates and to undo the packing of the Trade Union Council with delegates who were not bona fide Trade Unionists.&quot;It may be remarked that this proceeding brought the Trade Union Council back to the position which it had held prior to Sept-ember, 1926, and it cancelled the effect of legal actions which had taken place in the com-se of the year.The Earlier Difficulties.With regard to these legal actions, in 1924 the representatives who were elected when the original Trade Union Council was formed in 1921 resigned their seats and a writ was issued to the returning officer for the election of two members to fill their places. The officer sent the writ back on the ground that he had been appointed returning officer for 1921 only. No fresh writ was issued, and, while the two seats were vacant, the Governor, by Notice No. 308 of the 30th September, 1926, repealed the Notice of 1921 by which the first Trade Union Council was constituted and issued Regulations for the constitution of a new Council, the Regulations giving a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from the refusal of the Registrar to register a Union. On the 15th December,  1926, the  Secretary of the Workers&apos;  Union,
Malta Branch No. 1, appealed to the Court of Appeal from a de-cision of the Registrar refusing to enter the Workers&apos; Union on the Register. On the 19th January, 1927, Sir Gerald Strickland asked for leave to intervene and contended that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to entertain an Appeal from the Regis-trar&apos;s refusal, on the ground that the Regulations of September, 1926, were ultra vires the Governor and that the Trade Union Council was an autonomous body, alone entitled to adjudicate upon its own constitution. On the 24th January the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Registrar and held that the Workers&apos; Union should be entered upon the Register. On the same date the Court of Appeal refused Sir Gerald Strickland&apos;s application for leave to intervene. On the 1st April the Court refused him leave to appeal to Your Majesty in Council. He then applied in person to Your Majesty in Council for leave to appeal, and this application was refused on the 10th May, 1927. The effect of the whole of these decisions was eliminated by the action taken by the Governor on the 16th August by which he revoked the Regulations of the 30th September, 1926.&quot;The Election of Colonel W. Savona and Mr. M. Borg.Following upon the decision of the 16th August, the Governor on the 20th August recognized a new Trade Union Council, elim-inating the Unione Cattolica, the Societa dei Piloti and a Benefit Union, and adding the National Farmers&apos; Union, the National Union of Seamen, the Union of Dockyard Employees and the Ghakda Maltija, bodies which had not been recognized as members of the Council of 1926. Sir Gerald Strickland called in the writ from the Secretary of the Council, who returned it without con-suiting anyone but the ex-President. On the 2nd September a new writ was issued. On the 19th September it was made known that Colonel William Savona and Mr. Michelangelo Borg had been returned unopposed. This was the election that Mr. Walter Agius, acting in his capacity as one of the delegates of the Unione Catto-lica, as recognized by Notice No. 303 of the 9th August, issued a writ of summons to impugn. The Societa dei Piloti also took action.Wide Jurisdiction claimed by the Court of Appeal.With this case began the long struggle of the Government with the Court of Appeal, which from the first claimed and has since maintained that it is the sole and final authority, without any right of appeal from its decisions, to settle all matters connected with elections, including the validity of elections to the Legis-lature, and of the laws passed by that body by a majority resulting
from impugned votes. In effect, the Court claims to have a general control of a very wide character over the proceedings of the Legis-lature. This authority is claimed mainly by virtue of Section 33 of the Constitution Letters Patent, which runs : -&quot; All questions which may arise as to the right of any per-son to be or remain a Member of the Senate or Legislative Assembly shall be referred to and decided by Our Court of Appeal in Malta.&quot;Judgment unseating Savona and Borg.Without dealing with the preliminary pleas of the parties to the case, it may suffice to say that on the 5th December, 1927, judg-ment was delivered by the Court of Appeal, and Savona and Borg were unseated, on the ground that, however wide might appear to be the power conferred upon the Governor by Section 7 of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent, 1921, he had recognized a Trade Union Council and entrusted it with the duty of selecting two of its members to form part of the Upper House, and after such action the power of the Governor had been exhausted. After the commencement of the election, the revocation on the part of the Governor of the election writ and the steps taken thereunder, in so far as such measures affected the vested right of the Asso-ciations which had been selected and of the members of the Council formed by those Associations, were illegal. On the 14th December the Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal, but the defendants entered an Appeal to the Privy Council.On the 9th December, 1927, Professor Bartolo said in the Senate:  I again repeat the pledge I have made to the Opposition, to the Senate as a whole : until such time as we have a final judgment the Government will not bring forward any con-controversial matter before the House.....Sir GeraldStrickland or myself will proceed to England to do our best to expedite the decision of the case, because we want to prove to the honourable gentlemen opposite and to the whole country that we mean to respect the decision of the Court of Appeal and that we have appealed against its judgment not because we have anything to say against that Court but because we want to exhaust the whole judicial procedure in this case and the Privy Council is, according to the Constitution, part of the judicial institutions of the Island, as it is of the Empire.. If the Judicial Committee does not give judgment in our favour, then the Opposition will have nothing to corn-plain against, because in the meantime we will .have done nothing which might be construed into forcing upon the people
of Malta any measure upon which there are differences of opinion whilst the validity of the election of two Members of the Senate was in question.&quot;Professor Bartolo repeated this assurance on a subsequent occasion.The two Senators also wrote a letter to the President of the Senate saying that, out of respect to the Court of Appeal, they woidd not take their seats until they had obtained from the Privy Council leave to appeal. On the 17th May, 1928, the Privy Council refused leave to appeal, whereby these two Senators were finally unseated.The Appropriation Bill The Senate&apos;s opposition.Meanwhile the Appropriation Bill for 1928-9 came before the Senate for a second reading on the 21st March. This Bill, in effect, constituted the first budget of the Administration of which Lord Strickland&apos; was the head. Important as were the issues of financial principle which the Bill raised, they were quickly over-shadowed by the political consequences which flowed from it. In perspective it stands out clearly as one of the main origins of the later break-down.The procedure in matters of supply followed in the Malta Legisla-ture differs from that obtaining in the House of Commons. In Malta taxation is levied by permanent legislation, which requires no annual renewal. The Appropriation Act in each financial year merely appropriates revenue to specific services. It makes no allu-sion to the sources from which the funds are to be drawn.When the Bill was first introduced, however, it became plain that it was based on a financial policy which contemplated an excess of expenditure over revenue of  138,050. A portion of thisi deficit was to be covered by a surplus balance from the preceding year amounting to about  50,000 net. The remainder of the deficit was to be met by appropriating the whole of what was known as the Reserve Fund, amounting to some  76,000, and by taking  10,000 from the Lotto Reserve Fund.When the Bill came before the Senate the apprehensions felt by the Opposition Senators regarding this policy were quick to find expression. They contended that the matter ought not to be put to them merely as an annual measure of routine character, and that they were entitled to be given, as was customary, some ex-explanation of the general financial policy npon which it was based.* Sir Gerald Strickland had been elevated to the Peerage in January, 1928.
They desired some assurance that the country was in a position to budget for so large an excess of expenditure over revenue. Ex-ception was also taken to some of the details of the proposed expenditure, and especially to proposals for an increase in the per-sonal emoluments of the higher employees in the Government ser-vice.The main object of criticism, however, was the policy of meeting the deficit by an inroad into the Reserve Fund. This Fund had been constituted by Act No. IX of 1925 and was one of the cardinal achievements of the Nationalist Administration in the field of finance. The object was to build up a fund of  100,000 to provide against any future emergencies of an extraordinary nature.  50,000 was allocated to this Fund on its inception, and the law provided for the annual addition of sums between  5,000 and  10,000 until the total of  100,000 was reached.The policy, it must be admitted, was a sound one, and easily justified on grounds of financial principle. In a small island such as Malta the yield of taxation is liable to considerable fluctuation and alternative sources of revenue are limited. In these conditions the formation of a Reserve Fund, to be drawn on only in time of real emergency, is a prudent measure and in accordance with the dictates of experience in the administration of small Colonies.When the Appropriation Bill was read a second time in the Senate on the 21st March, the Leader of the Opposition, speaking in the name of the eight Senators who (in the absence of repre-sentatives of the Trade Union Council) constituted a majority in the House, declared that in the Committee stage he proposed to recommend certain amendments to the Bill. The discussion was continued on the following day, when the Senators, by a majority of one, carried the adjournment of the Senate to the 11th April, that is, 11 days after the beginning of the new financial year.It was evident that there would be no chance of getting the Bill passed unless the powers of the Senate could be in some manner curtailed, and, even if that object was accomplished, it was apparent, as soon as the judgment in the &quot; Savona-Borg &quot; case had been given, that it was of importance to Lord Strickland to have as many representatives as possible in the Senate in order to have any chance of getting the Appropriation Bill passed at a joint sitting. These two objects, both affecting the Senate, ran concurrently.Ministerial Efforts to restrict Power of Senate.It would be advisable first to mention the course of the efforts made by Lord Strickland and his party to restrict the power of the
Senate. For this purpose the assistance of the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Amery) was invoked. On the 28th March, 1928, the Legislative Assembly, on Lord Strickland&apos;s proposal, passed, by 17 votes to 13, as an urgent matter, a resolution to submit a humble Petition, praying Your Majesty to be graciously pleased to impart immediate instructions that the Con-stitution be amended in such a way as to secure the supremacy of the Legislative Assembly in financial matters. On the other hand, the Senate, on the 11th April, proposed and passed unanimously  the Ministerial Party having abstained from voting a counter motion, reaffirming the rights and privileges of the Senate under the Letters Patent of 1921 as &quot; intact, integral and inviolable.&quot;On the 22nd May a telegram from the Secretary of State to the Governor was published by Notice No. 143. The Secretary of State said : &quot; The Petition to His Majesty from the Legislative Assem-bly submitted in your despatch of the 27th April, has received careful examination and I am certainly impressed by the defect in machinery which present deadlock reveals and by the desirability in the interests of all parties of considering whether steps should not be taken to ensure the supremacy of the Legislative Assembly so far as matters of supply are con-cerned. I gather however that counter-Petition by the Oppo-sition has been lodged and I do not propose to tender any advice to His Majesty on the matter until I have had an opportunity of considering the arguments it contains.&quot;Mr. Amery&apos;s Decision to Amend Constitution.There appears to have been some delay in Malta, of which the Opposition complained, before their counter-Petition was forwarded to the Secretary of State. In a telegram dated the 21st June, however, Mr. Amery intimated that his view-s remained unaffected. His decision was expressed in the following terms : &quot; My telegram of 21st May Appropriation Bill. Study of counter-Petition submitted to me by the Opposition Party has not led me to modify the view expressed provisionally in my telegram that present deadlock reveals defect in the machinery of the Constitution and that it is desirable in the interests of all parties that steps should be taken to secure supremacy of Legislative Assembly in matters of supply. In order to achieve this object I shall be prepared to advise His Majesty to sanc-tion the necessary amendment to the Letters Patent. I am anxious however that such an amendment should as far as possible be on the lines that will command general assent in Malta.   I accordingly propose in the first instance to foi-ward
draft amending Letters to you for consideration and report. Before reporting you should take such steps as may be prac-ticable to ensure that opportunity for comment and criticism is given both to Government and to Opposition Parties.&quot;The Amending Letters Patent of the 1st August, 1928.After the views of the Government and of the Opposition had been expressed on the draft, Letters Patent to amend Section 41 of the Constitution Letters Patent were issued on the 1st August, and promulgated on the 7th August, 1928. Section 1 of these Letters Patent ran as follows :  &quot; Section 41 of Our said Letters Patent is hereby amended by the addition of the following provisos after the proviso to Sub-Section (6) of the said Section : &quot; Provided nevertheless that if any proposed Law shall (a) amend Sub-Section (3) of Section 42 of these Our Letters Patent by substituting Tor the words &quot; two-thirds of the total number of the Members of the Senate and Legislative Assembly &quot; (wherever they occur) the words &quot; a majority of the Members present other than the presiding Member, who shall have and exercise a- cast-ing vote in case of an equality of votes,&quot; or (b) amend Section 61 of these Our Letters Patent by substituting for the words, &quot; and thereafter the Senate may either accept or reject such Bill, but may not alter it,&quot; the words &quot; and thereafter the Senate shall be deemed to accept such Bill, and it shall be taken to have been duly passed by the Legislature,&quot; such proposed Law shall, notwithstanding the foregoing proviso, be valid if it shall be affirmed in each House of the Legislature by a majority - of the Members present other than the presiding Member, who shall, however, have and exercise a casting vote in case of an equality of votes, as provided by Section 28 of these Our Letters Patent, or, in the event of disagreement between the two Houses with regard to any such proposed Law, if it shall be affirmed by a majority of the Members of the two Houses present other than the presiding Member at a Joint sitting thereof to be convened under Sub-Section (1) or Sub-Section (2) of Section 42 of these Our Letters Patent, and the presiding Member shall have and exercise a casting vote in case of an equality of votes at any such joint sitting &quot;.&quot; Provided further that if the Senate shall refuse or omit to consider and deal with any such proposed Law as aforesaid within one month from the date on which it shall have been affirmed by the Legislative Assembly, the Governor shall have power to convene forthwith a joint sitting of the two Houses at which the foregoing provisions as to voting by the Members
present at a joint sitting caused by disagreement between the two Houses shall apply.&apos;&apos;It should be noted that these Letters Patent necessitated the passing of a law by the Legislature, and until that law was passed nothing whatever could be done. That was a reason why it became so necessary for the Government to obtain members of the Senate who would vote on its side at a joint sitting, since, in order to pass the law and, after the law had been passed and the Constitution had been amended, to pass certain other laws, it would not be necessary to have a majority of two-thirds of the total number of members of the Senate and the Legislative Assembly, but only a majority of the members present, other than the presiding member, who &apos;&apos; shall have and exercise a casting vote in case of an equality of votes.&quot;   There was not even a quorum mentioned.The Election of new Representatives of the Trade Union Council.Turning to the other question of filling the vacancies caused by the unseating of Colonel Savona and Mr. B-org by the decision of the Privy Council, the Nationalists, in the belief that, after this decision, adherents of their party would be elected, were anxious for speed; and on the 2nd June a demand was made by Mr. Giuseppe Grima, who claimed to be Secretary of the Trade Union Council and returning officer in terms of the Regulations, that a writ be issued without further delay for the election of two new Trade Union Senators.   On the 13th June Mr. Borg Olivier proposed motions that formal notice of the vacancies be given to the Governor and that the Governor be asked to take the necessary steps for the election of representatives of the Trade Union Council to be pro-ceeded with without delay, in conformity with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The motions were opposed by the Government but carried by a large majority.   On the 8th June a new writ was issued. The writ, however, was directed not to Mr. Giuseppe Grima, who claimed to be acting in conformity with the judgment of the Court of Appeal, but to Mr. G. Calleja, who had been the returning officer at the previous election.   Mr. Calleja sent back the writ, on the ground that his term of office had expired.   Thereupon, on the 19th June, Government Notice No. 163 was issued, appointing certain gentlemen to be election officers to select a returning officer. To   this   procedure   the   Nationalists   at   once   objected.     On the   20th   June   it   was   proposed  as   a  motion   of   urgency and   privilege   that :    &quot; The   Senate   deplores   the   illegality resorted   to   by   the   Head   of   the   Government   in   issuing Notice No.  163 published in the Government Gazette of the 19th June, 1928, ordering the Clerk of this House to convene a meeting, in the office of the Minister for Justice, of certain persons
mentioned therein who do not legally constitute the Trade Union Council, for the purpose of electing among themselves a returning officer to whom a fresh writ may be issued for the election of two representatives of the Malta Trade Union Council in the Senate.&quot; Resolutions were attached thereto to the effect that the intervention of the Clerk was a breach of privilege and that the Governor be asked to take other steps than those illegally taken by the Govern-ment, in order to conform with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The latter resolution the President declared not to be urgent and to require five days&apos; notice, although, according to Government Notice No. 163, the meeting was convened to take place within three days, on the 23rd June. On that date, the persons mentioned in the Government Notice met, and Mr. Walter Agius, by means of a judicial act, protested against the procedure as illegal. The delegates took no notice, but appointed Mr. Galea as returning officer, and an election writ was issued to him on the 25th June. On the 5th July Mr. Galea certified that Mr. Michelangelo Borg and Mr. Armando Mifsud had been returned unopposed. They took their oath as Senators and commenced to sit and vote as members of the constituency of the Trade Union Council in the Senate. The legality and the validity of their election were impugned by Mr. Walter Agius and others on the 5th July and thereupon the second legal duel began.Genesis of the Politico-Keligious Disputes.With the uncertainty whether these two Trade Union Senators would be unseated or not, it was of importance to Lord Strickland to carry his Appropriation Bill as soon as he possibly could; and his attempt to do this involved him in the first politico-religious dispute with the Church. On the 11th July there were strong protests in the Senate, alleging that Lord Strickland, as Minister for Justice, was delaying the constitution of the Court of Appeal, and on the same day the Senate had under consideration a motion by Professor Bartolo to the effect that the message of the Legislative Assembly for the rescission of the rejection of the second reading of the Appropriation Bill by the Senate be considered forthwith. The two representatives of the clergy voted with the Opposition and the motion was negatived. This action raised excitement and a hostile demonstration occurred. Lord Strickland had an inter-view with the Archbishop and asked that he would instruct the representatives of the clergy to support the Government on a measure that was not directed against the Church, stating that these representatives were unduly supporting the Opposition. The Arch-bishop objected that he had fulfilled his duty by nominating two representatives and that he did not interfere in politics and would not and did not attempt to influence their votes. He appointed men of moderate views and left them free unless the interests of the Church were concerned.
The Attitude of the Representatives of the Clergy in the Senate.At a sitting on the 18th July the two representatives of the clergy threw the whole blame on the Government. Professor Bartolo expressed his regret that religion and politics were not being kept apart. He particularly regretted that the act of the Archbishop in issuing a circular alluding to an alleged blasphemous cry and the treatment of the clerical repre-sentativesin the Senate should be subjects of criticism in the House. He protested that the circular contained inaccurate assertions, and he attacked the representatives of the clergy for voting with the Government when their votes did not make any difference and voting against the Government or abstaining from voting when the passing of the Appropriation Bill depended on their votes. He said that the fact that Senators were representatives of the clergy did not mean that they were unlike other Senators and free from criticism, and he defied anyone to say who among the Ministers had offended the clergy. Mgr. Zammit replied that the representatives of the clerg3? did not pretend that they were not subject to criticism, but simiply held that the people should not be incited against them, as was being done in certain newspapers in the vernacular. Professor Cassar said it seemed that the true position of the priests in the Legislature had not been understood, that so long as a priest was a politician he was liable to be hissed or cheered by the people and the priest-politician did not enjoy any privilege simply because he wore the cloth. To this remark at that time Mgr. Zammit replied that the representatives of the clergy did not want to enjoy any privilege.Mr. Borg Olivier moved a resolution for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the responsibility for the demonstration of the 11th July, and an acrimonious discussion arose. On the 1st August the representatives of the clergy wrote to the President of the Senate saying that, as they could not freely discharge their senatorial duties in view of the campaign against them in certain sections of the Press, they felt compelled to abstain from attending the sittings of the Senate as long as an end was not put to the abnormal state of affairs. Professor Bartolo said that the representatives of the clergy were shirking their responsibility and running away just at a time when circumstances placed the balance in their hands : the attacks in the papei-s were directed against them not as priests but as priest-politicians : and the Government had grounds for believing that the representa-tives of the clergy would have been animated by sentiments of Christian justice and charity and of goodwill towards the hundreds of thousands who were clamouring for bread which they could not get because the two representatives of the clergy either voted.
against the Government or abstained from voting on important divisions. He said that the representatives of the clergy even resented the most natural request on the part of the Government that they should cease to sit side by side with the Opposition, and they were therefore all the time subject to the whispers, the insinuations and the suggestions of the Opposition Members.The letter submitted to the President of the Senate by the two representatives of the clergy, to the effect that they were going to abstain from sitting in the Senate until normal conditions had been restored, was alluded to in debate at a meeting of the Senate on the 28th August, when Lord Strickland is reported to have said : &quot; The meaning of this threat is that certain priests (I would not say which, but they were representatives of the clergy) are going to be politically hostile to my Party at the next election, and I take this threat as a declaration of war. (Dr. Bartolo) : And we accept it. (Lord Strickland) : I am not going to say which priests are the threatening priests.   The electors of this country are not women.If we had votes for women perhaps I would have been afraid of similar threats, but the vote is as yet restricted to the men of Malta, and I trust the men of Malta.&quot;There can be no doubt that this statement gave considerable offence to the Church.It might have been hoped that calm had been restored when, on the 10th September, the two representatives of the clergy reappeared and attended sittings until the end of the session on the 9th October. The subject of the attendance and voting of the representatives of the clergy, however, arose again at a subsequent date.Senators Borg and Mifsud unseated by the Court of Appeal.Meanwhile, on the 14th August, 1928, judgment was delivered by the Court of Appeal, unseating Senators Borg and Mifsud. The Court took the view that the election of the Trade Union repre-sentatives had been held by the Council as recognized by Notice 93 of 1927 and not by the Council under the two Notices 93 and 303 of the same year, in accordance with the judgment in the previous case, Agius v. Savona. Application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council was filed by the defendants in the Ministry of Justice and rejected by the Court on the 7th September, 1928, the Court again upholding its previously expressed view that it was the supreme Court in electoral matters and that the matter was unappealable.   The Court made no order to stay execution.
The Grant of Special Leave to Appeal.The defendants applied to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal, and on the 5th November, 1928, the Privy Council granted their application. The case was not heard until November, 1929, and judgment was not delivered until the 27th February, 1930. The question of the right of these two Senators to continue to sit after special leave to appeal had been applied for and a subsequent dispute on the question whether they had any right to sit and vote after leave was given, were the causes of much of the trouble that subsequently ensued.Mr. Borg 01ivier&apos;s Observations.On the 16th August Mr. Borg Olivier, on the adjournment of the House, said the two Senators :  &quot; . . . must decide whether they may or may not take part in the sittings; for, according to me, the Judgment is obligatory until there is an appeal lodged, and, although they may have time to present this, still I think that until they do so their presence here is not in order. On this question we reserve to ourselves full liberty. I did not want to raise this question at the beginning of the sitting, because I did not want to waste the time of the House; but I am raising the question now at the end of the sitting. That is, I am asking whether they have lodged an appeal against that Judgment, and if they do not intend to do so (which I do not wish to believe) then they should conform to the Judgment.&quot; We cannot pass over without comment the fact that various laws have been approved with the votes of the two representatives here who have been found to be invalidly elected and against whom there is a Judgment which pro-hibits them from occupying those seats without having previously lodged an appeal against that Judgment. I think that this state of affairs may have serious consequences so far as any of the laws passed with the aid of their vote are con-cerned. There is to-day a Judgment against them, and in spite of it they have come here. They have not lodged an appeal against the Judgment, but I heard from Professor Bartolo that they intend doing so. Therefore, until they lodge an appeal, I do not think they can legally take their seats here Let them lodge an appeal, and then they can do what will be suggested to them by whomsoever is in duty bound to do so.
&quot; In any case, I move the adjournment of the House to this, day week, reserving to ourselves the right to take any action which we may think necessary to make the Senate (if not the two persons in question) conform to the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal.&quot;It may be noted that on the 22nd August also Mr. Borg Olivier said :  &quot; Before we begin our work I wish to propose from this moment the adjournment of the House because this illegal and immoral state of affairs cannot be further tolerated by us on this side of the House. We know that in regard to the two late Members of the Senate a Judgment has been given declaring their election invalid. We know that up to this moment these two Members have been sitting as if nothing had happened. For this reason if we were to assent to the discussion of the Order cf the Day, we would be making our-selves accomplices of these illegalities and would be sanction-ing this state of affairs.&quot;The two membex-s sat after the judgment of the 14th August on the grounds that they were going to apply for leave to appeal to the Privy Council; but after the Court of Appeal on the 10th September had refused leave to appeal, they wrote to the President of the Senate, saying that out of respect to the tribunal they would abstain from sitting, reserving to themselves the right to attend the sittings if and when the Privy Council gave them leave to appeal.In his evidence before us Mr. Borg Olivier stated that his speech was not as concise and clear as usual and said &quot; but, while I admit that I was not correct on that occasion, I must submit that there and then I made also some reservations,&quot; and that he was under the impression that the translation did not correspond correctly to his speech, in the sense that one page had been trans-lated before another. Although that may be the present explana-tion, it does not appear to us the sense in which the speech might have been taken at the time.The Two Senators continue to sit.In the next session in December, following the grant by the Privy Council of special leave to appeal, the two Senators attended the Senate and sat and voted, ignoring the repeated and strongly ex-pressed objections of the Opposition.In the autumn of 1928, when the Appropriation Bill had been twice defeated, it might have been open to the Governor to inform
Lord Strickland that, if the Government could not be carried on, the electorate must be again consulted. The Governor was in a difficult position, since an appeal to the Privy Council was being lodged against the decision of the Court of Appeal and Ministers were taking the view that if special leave was granted, the two members could sit and vote, and that the law indicated by Mr. Amery could be carried, and that when it was carried the Appropriation Bill and other proposed Bills could also be carried under the terms of the amended Constitution. The Governor apparently felt it his duty to take the advice of his Ministers, and considered that, when a Government was in office so soon after the Legislature had been elected, it was not reasonable for the Governor to withdraw support from the Ministry of the day and not to be guided by their advice. In view of subsequent events, another course might have been taken, but we are not disposed to criticize the Governor for the decision at which he arrived. There is no doubt in our minds that Lord Strickland was determined to carry through his Bills; and so long as the case was still sub judice by means of an appeal to the Privy Council, it had not been definitely decided that the two Senators had no light to sit and vote.On the 4th December, 1928, in spite of the judgment of the 14th August, the two Senators took their seats, pleading the special leave to appeal granted by the Privy Council on the 5th November. The Leader of the Opposition raised a formal objection, on the ground that the special leave to appeal did not involve a stay of execution of the sentence of the Court. The President of the Senate ruled that the motion did not touch the privileges of the House and that, as the question was sub judice, it could not be taken into consideration.On the 6th December, 1928, the Legislative Assembly, by a simple Resolution and by a suspension of the Rules, passed the proposed law to amend Section 42 (3) and Section 61 of the Malta Constitution Letters Patents of 1921, for the purpose of curtail-ing the powers of the Senate. On the 4th December notice had been given in the Senate of a motion not to allow Messrs. Mifsud and Borg to sit and vote in the Senate and thus to reverse the ruling given by the President. The President replied by a letter on the 6th December, to the Senator in whose name the motion stood, saying that he had ruled the motion out of order. As a protest against this ruling, the Nationalist Senators abstained from the sitting of the 12th December, and there was no quorum. On the 19th December another resolution, tending to reverse the ruling of the President and to express no confidence, in him, was moved and discussed, but when it was put to the vote the President ruled that it was irregular and out of order\
as constituting a violation of the Eules of the House forbidding the discussion of matters sub judice. As a protest the sitting was adjourned. On the 21st December the Opposition Senators, 10 in number and forming the majority of the Members composing the Senate, sent a letter to the President, informing him that he no longer enjoyed their confidence and inviting him to tender his resignation. On the 28th December they sent a memorandum to the Governor, requesting that it be transmitted to the Secretary &quot;of State, in which they signified their intention not to take part in the business of the House until the Presidential Chair was vacated. On the 5th January, 1929, the last day of the period of one month from the 6th December, 1928, on which date the proposed law for the amendment of the Letters Patent of 1921 had been passed by the Legislative Assembly, the Governor proceeded to follow the requirements of the Letters Patent of 1928. By a Proclamation, premising that the Senate had omitted to consider the proposed law in question within the period of one month, he convened a joint sitting for the 8th January. Twenty-three Senators and Deputies of the Opposition meanwhile submitted to the Governor, for transmission to the Secretary of State, a memorandum asking that the joint sitting be not held, or that at least Messrs Mifsud and Borg be not allowed to take part in such sitting, and that, at the worst, the proposed law, if carried, be reserved for the direct assent of Your Majesty.Passage of the Law to amend the Constitution.On the 8th January the joint sitting was held, and it was pro-posed that Mr. Speaker Hamilton be elected to preside. The Leader of the Opposition declared that he and the members of the Opposition had intervened at the sitting under protest against the presence of two gentlemen who had appeared notwithstanding the judgment of the Court of xVppeal. The House proceeded to divide on the motion that Mr. Hamilton should preside, and the division showed 25 for and 23 against, the &quot; ayes &quot; including Messrs. Mifsud and Borg. On the occupation of the Chair, the protest made in the name of the Opposition against the presence of the two individuals was reiterated. Mr. Hamilton, however, ruled that the two members had a right to sit and vote, on the ground that the competent Court had made no order in regard to the matter and the question was still sub judice. The following resolution was then proposed by Lord Strickland as Head of the Ministry : &quot; That the passing of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent Amendment Bill as last proposed by the Legislative Assembly be now affirmed by the Joint Sitting of Honourable Members of both Houses of Parliament.&quot;
After a debate which ended by the application of the closure, carried by 24 votes to 23 votes, the resolution was passed by one vote, there being 24 &quot; ayes &quot; and 23 &quot; noes.&quot; In both divisions Messrs. Mifsud and Borg were amongst the &quot; ayes.&quot; The Governor at once proceeded to give his assent on the 10th January, 1929, and the Act was published in the Government Gazette on the same day.Further laws were proposed by the Government in the Legisla-tive Assembly, including an Act to repeal and re-enact with amend-ments the Electoral Law, which was read for the first time on the 20th May, 1929, and passed on the 4th June, 1929, by the Legis-lative Assembly. The Senate made several amendments to the various Bills and rejected some of them. On the 8th July the Legislative Assembly disapproved the amendments. On the 9th July the Governor prorogued the Legislature and summoned a new session for the 11th July. At the sitting of the Legislative, Assembly on the loth July, 13 Bills, including the Electoral Law, were passed en bloc by a single resolution. On the 17th and 24th July the Senate did not hold any sittings, as owing to the absence of the Nationalist Senators a quorum was not obtainable. The Officer administering the Government, premising that the Senate had omitted to consider and had failed to pass the 13 Bills in question, convened a joint sitting for the 26th July. On that date the members of the Opposition Party abstained from attend-ing. The 13 laws, including the Electoral Law, were passed at that sitting by means of a resolution, voted for unanimously by the members present, 25 in number, inclusive of the President.The Resignation of the two Representatives of the Clergy.Luring this pei-iod the attitude of the representatives of the clergy also gave lise to difficulties with the Government. These representatives attended the opening sitting of the Senate on the 4th December, 1928, but were absent from the subsequent sitting on the 12th December. Mgr. Zammit attended on the 19th De-december, and on the 26th December Mgr. Vella Mangion resigned his seat. Mgr. Zammit did not attend on the 27th December, 1928, or the 2nd January, 1929, but when a joint sitting of both Houses was held on the 8th January, for the purpose of considers ing the Bill amending the Constitution Letters Patent, Mgr. Zammit attended. He absented himself on the 16th, 23rd and 30th January and resigned his seat on the 1st February. The suggestion was made that, by attending the joint sitting only, Mgr. Zammit showed his intention of making the passage of the Constitution Letters Patent Amendment Bill contingent upon the help of the Trade Union Council members, the validity of whose
election was under challenge. Subsequent to the resignation of Mgr. Vella Mangion, a writ was issued to the Archbishop to fill the vacancy, but the Archbishop replied that the persons approached by him &quot; could not see their way, under present circumstances, to accept the nomination.&quot; On the 21st February a second writ was issued for the filling of the two vacant seats, and on the 4th March the Archbishop replied in the same terms as before. The Governor, in acknowledging the receipt of the letter, regretted that the Archbishop &quot; had not been able to find two suitable eccle-siastics to fill the vacancies, ... as important legislation in the Senate was consequently being delayed.&quot; It was not until the 4th February, 1930, a year later, that the Archbishop requested the Governor to issue the writ for the filling of the two seats.This sketch of proceedings in the Legislature may serve to indi-cate the strong opposition, continuously increased, to nearly all the proceedings of Lord Strickland and his administration, and our impression is that nearly every action to which a sinister-implication could be given was attributed with increasing force to Lord Strickland alone, as the dominating power in the Consti-tutional Party a Party which received on almost all points the full support of the Labour Party. It is useless to disguise the opinion that Lord Strickland was a dominating and aggressive force, with a manner calculated to cause irritation and annoyance and with methods of attack wdiich involved personal animosity on the part of many of those who were attacked, leading to a tendency for the whole Island to be divided into very embittered cliques. We think that these feelings and views were carried too far; and that the attribution to Lord Strickland of all the proceed-ings of the Government, supported as he was by so many strong adherents, assigned too much to him alone the responsibility for actions to which objection was taken.CHAPTER IV. THE DISPUTES WITH THE ecclesiastical-TICAL AUTHORITIES.The Father Carta Case.The troubles in the Legislature were not the only difficulties in which the Government was involved. Its difficulties were enhanced in the spring of 1929 by further troubles with the Church.Father Micallef ordered to leave Malta.For some time discipline in one of the monastic orders, which are subject to the control not of the Bishops but of Superiors in Borne,
-appears to have become lax. It had been decided in Rome that action must be taken with regard to the Franciscan Conventual Order, and, in view of the difficulties of obtaining a monk of British nationality, Father Carta, a native of Sardinia, who had been stationed at Cagliari in Sardinia for 16 years and was known as a good disciplinarian, was sent to Malta as Commissary General of the Franciscan Minor Conventual Friars by his Superior General, at the request of the local ecclesiastical authorities and certain local members of the Order. Father Carta stated in evidence before us that he found one of the most insubordinate monks of the Community was Father Guido Micallef, to whom he was finally obliged to give canonical warnings as to breaches of monastic discipline. Father Carta followed the instructions of the Superior General, who finally, on the 10th November, 1928, wrote to him that the Superior of the Convent himself complained that he could not continue any longer with Father Micallef and had asked the Superior General that Father Micalief should be removed from the Convent in which he was, the Superior of the Convent stating that otherwise he would have to send in his resignation. The Superior General sent Father Carta a &quot; Paper of Obedience,&quot; in which he ordered that Father Micallef should be transferred from the convent in Malta to the convent at Liverpool, where there were thi-ee Maltese. Father Micallef objected to this on the ground of the winter cold of England, and the Superior General informed Father Carta that, if that was the sole excuse for Father Micallefs non-departure, he should go to the Franciscan Convent at Palermo and await a good season for going to England.The Political Significance of the Case.The history of the case is a long one. It derives its political significance, from the contention urged by Lord Strickland&apos;s Ministry that Father Micallef was being ordered to leave Malta, under pain of spiritual reprisals, by an Italian religious superior because he was known to be a supporter of the Constitutional Party. Their view was that Father Micallef was the victim of a political plot, and that in reality he was being punished, not for any breach of domestic discipline, but for his political opinions.The Governors Intervention.It appears that the Governor made every effort to prevent an open dispute over the matter between ecclesiastical authorities and Ministers, but not too successfully. It is clear that the Imperial authorities were not prepared to read into Father Carta&apos;s action the political significance attributed to it by Ministers, and every
endeavour appears to have been made to prevent the Imperial side of the Dyarchy from being drawn into a dispute with the ecclesiastical authorities on this issue. The Governor had twice to intervene on specific points. Ministers, with a view to rendering Father Carta&apos;s instructions nugatory, proposed to instruct the police to refuse to give a &quot; boarding permit &quot; to Father Micallef should he apply for one. The Governor thereupon informed the Head of the Ministry that the question of a &quot; boarding permit &quot; was one to be decided by him (the Governor) as the permits were issued under the Passport Eegulations which were a reserved matter. He furthermore proceeded to abolish the system of &quot; boarding permits &quot; which was a relic of wartime restrictions. Lord Strick-land, at the time, put forward some allegations that this abolition of the system constituted an attempt by the Governor to obtain control of the police. This allegation appears to us to be frivolous; and we are convinced that there was no foundation for it.No Grounds for the Expulsion of Father Carta.The Governors second intervention was with regard to a pro-posal by Ministers that Father Carta should be deported as an undesirable alien. The Governor took the view that since the subject of &quot; Aliens &quot; was a reserved matter under the Constitution this question also was for him to decide. He considered that there were no grounds for the expulsion of Father Carta and refused to take any action. We are of opinion that the Governor&apos;s decision was correct, and in the course of our inquiries we heard nothing to support the suggestion that there was any genuine ground on which Father Carta could have been expelled.The power of removal from one province to another or from one country to another pertains to the Superior General only, and there is no reason to suppose that the Superior General had any other intention than that Father Micallef should be transferred from Malta to Liverpool, within the British Empire, had not Father Micallef himself objected. According to the rules of his Order, the Superior of a religious province has not the power to transfer one of his subjects from one province to another, much less from one country to another, but simply from one convent to another within his jurisdiction.Father Carta&apos;s Denial.It was alleged that Father Carta was acting politically in the interests of Fascism against the Constitutional Government, that he had written an article (with which in fact he had nothing to do
123and which he had never read), that he had frequented a Club (of which be did not know the situation) and that he had interfered in politics (when he had not done so). Father Carta most indignantly denied these allegations as false. With reference to the allegation that he had written a Fascist article, Father Carta wrote to the Archbishop, on the 3rd January, 1931, saying that ever since he had set foot in the Island he had &quot; taken great care not to do any act, to utter any words or to express any opinion to anybody, whereby anyone might ever be entitled (without acting in bad faith) to accuse me of meddling in politics of any colour or tendency &quot; and that he had no other purpose in mind than &quot; the maintenance of regular and religious discipline and its re-establish-ment and strict observance.&quot;The dispute about Father Carta went further. He was accused of sending letters without Maltese stamps to Italy, so that they might be posted in Italy, contrary to the Maltese postal regula-tions. His explanation was that he handed from four to six letters to the agent of the Adria, in order that they might be trans-mitted by the ships of that Company which carry out postal ser-vices, that those letters were duly stamped with Maltese and Italian stamps and that he sent his correspondence through the Maltese post when that was the more convenient method. In this matter the prosecution was not proceeded with, but it undoubtedly caused feeling, owing to the suggestion that Father Carta was being persecuted and owing to the abuse to which Father Carta was subjected in the Press.The Legislative Assembly ask for an Inquiry.It would appear that the first reference to the Micallef case in the Legislative Assembly arose on the 4th January, 1929, when Dr. Mifsud Bonnici tried to move the adjournment of the House in connexion with it. The Speaker refused to accept the motion, which was again brought forward when the House was about to be adjourned. The Speaker remarked : &quot; Religion in this case does not come in at all, because when the jurisdiction and the functions of the Church are concerned it is almost the case of another State.&quot; On the 22nd January Sir Ugo Mifsud moved a resolution in condemnation of the action of the Government, and Lord Strickland moved as an amendment that there should be a humble request to the Vatican to appoint a fully authorized representative to inquire into the case and kindred questions, and this amendment was carried.Diplomatic Action.On the 23rd February Cardinal Gasparri sent a note to the British Minister in Rome, stating that &quot; the Holy See has learnt, with12158 d
deep regret and surprise, what has taken place in Malta in con-nexion with the measures adopted towards the Franciscan friar, Guido Micallef &quot; and requesting the Minister to use his good offices with the British Government in order &quot; that suitable instructions may be given to the authorities of Malta, with a view to reassuring the Holy See, as likewise the conscience of the Catholics of the Island.&quot; The reply made by the Minister was that the British Government &quot; certainly have no wish to be drawn into any dis-cussion of this particular case, nor do they desire to intervene in the internal disciplinary affairs of monastic orders, which are naturally mainly the concern of the properly constituted religious authorities. The general unsatisfactory state of affairs in Malta, however, of which the case of Father Micallef is apparently a sign, is viewed with some concern by His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; He suggested that an Apostolic Visitor should make an independent investigation, and added : &quot; It is understood, and your Eminence has emphasized this, that the Holy See wishes to discourage political agitation by priests. The disregard of this rule, and the intense participation of Maltese priests in local politics, it is con-sidered, lie at the root of the present trouble, and the probability is that this trouble will continue, whichever party may happen to hold office, until such political activity is ended.&quot; This statement requires to be noted, because it indicates the attitude taken by the British Government throughout the period of ensuing difficulties.Although the contention of the British Government might have a general foundation in political action by priests in various localities, particularly at the time of an election, we shall have occasion to allude later to the gradual diminution of the number of clerical candidatures at elections. As regards the individual case of Father Micallef, it might be inferred from the support given to him by the Constitutional Ministry on the ground that he was an adherent of their Party, that he furnished an instance of the &quot; intense participation of Maltese priests in local politics &quot;. In point of fact, however, it does not appear to be the case that he played any active part in politics. As i-egards Father Carta, we do not consider that the allegations of &quot; political activity &quot; on his part were substantiated; and his actions cannot, in our view, be interpreted as constituting an interference by priests in politics.On the 9th March the Cardinal Secretary of State replied that a simple Apostolic Visitation could not be conducted in an effective manner likely to produce lasting fruit, but &quot; The Holy Father would prefer to send to Malta a Delegate with the task of studying matters on the spot, with a view to removing possible abuses which up to the present may have crept in among the clergy-, secular and regular, and further to promote enduring friendly relations with the Government Authorities in the Island, from whom greater con-sideration towards the Church is hoped.&quot;
124Monsignor Robinson appointed Apostolic Delegate to Malta.Mgr. Paschal Robinson was selected for the mission as an Apostolic Delegate, not merely in the lesser position of a Visitor, and the selection was approved most cordially by the British Government. The Ministers in Malta also expressed their deep gratitude for the appointment and selection, and the Legislative Assembly on the 21st March passed a resolution to the same effect. A Bill was passed by the Assembly, for submission to the Senate, to confer certain powers upon the Apostolic Delegate, such as administering an oath and summoning witnesses under penalties. Mgr. Robinson made it clear that he did not desire to avail himself of these powers; and the proposal appears to have been quite unacceptable to him. In his report, dated the 16th June, 1929, to the Secretariat of State at Rome, he said : &quot; On my arrival in Malta (April 3rd), I received a copy of this law together with an official communication on the part of Lord Strickland, in which it was stated that in making such an inquiry public, it was expected, that &quot; the prestige of the Holy See would be greatly enhanced, and the success of the Delegated Mission assured.&quot;&quot; On the following day (April 4th), in the pi-esence of all the Ministers I informed Lord Strickland that I regarded the above-mentioned Act [as] neither necessary nor opportune, and that whether it became a law or not (thus far it had been approved only by the Assembly, not yet by the Senate), I did not intend to make use of it. I made it clear moreover that this Act was based upon an entirely erroneous concept of the office of an Apostolic Delegate, whose authority does not emanate from any civil law but is derived directly from the Holy See which confers on the Delegate all the faculties and powers of which he might have need in the execution of his Mission.&quot; My refusal to be fettered in any way by a clever arrange-ment originated entirely by himself, was for Lord Strickland a great disappointment, since he had already made it known that it was his intention to summon before the Delegate those who in any way had shown themselves contrary to or had criticized the politics and the conduct of their Minister, and that he would charge and arrest as perjurers all those whose testimony was found false. Besides he had had fitted out a large hall, and stenographers, police and soldiers had been notified to assist at this sort of politico-religious court-martial which he had conceived. When he finally realised that the Apostolic Delegate could not be limited or constrained to follow12458d 2
such methods, Lord Strickland with reluctance decided to withdraw the Act from Parliament before the Senate began deliberations upon it. After that it seemed that he had lost all confidence in the work of the Delegate, and on May 6th, he said publicly in the presence of some Canons, that he did not know the reason of the Delegated coming to Malta or what he would do there.&quot;Mgr. Robinson appears to have conducted his inquiry quietly and received proposals for a concordat from Lord Strickland, on which he subsequently remarked : &quot;A mere superficial examina-tion of these Notes is sufficient to understand the mentality and the Erastian politics of Lord Strickland, who wishes at all cost to make the Church subservient to the State and to reduce the Bishops and priests to the position of mere employees of the Government.&quot;Monsignor Robinson&apos;s Report.Mgr. Robinson stayed in Malta until the 2nd June. In his report he certainly -did not mince words, either in his criticism of Lord Strickland&apos;s personal actions or in his criticism of Lord Strickland&apos;s policies. While admitting the courtesy and regard shown to him during his sojourn in Malta, Mgr. Robinson con-sidered there was every reason to doubt whether there could be any peace and harmony in Malta as long as Lord Strickland remained in office. He stated that Lord Strickland was, beyond question, an individual of strict and even rigorous personal morality, who paradoxically enough maintained that to be a good Catholic it was necessary also to be a convinced anti-clerical; from the beginning of his public life he had manifested this strenuously anti-clerical tendency, and on certain points even anti-Catholic, and, while boasting of his respect for ecclesiastical authority, he exposed it continually to the ridicule of the public.The report ended with the suggestion : &apos;&apos; If such simple facts were duly set forth to the new Colonial Minister in London, he would easily understand the damage Strickland is doing to the prestige and the popularity of England in Malta, and for this reason, if for no other, he could decline all responsibility for the line of politics pursued by Lord Strick-land, or oblige him to modify the same, or, if that were not considered feasible, to find some way of eliminating him peace-fully from the political field in Malta.&quot;The full text of this report was published as Document No. XII in the Vatican White Book of 1930 : and it may be
125desirable for us to add that the translations from the Italian docu-ments which we quote in this account of the negotiations are taken from the White Book as translated and published by the &quot; Vatican Poliglot Press,&quot; entitled &quot; Exposition of the Malta Question with Documents (Translation).&quot; The exact meaning of some of the Italian sentences does not appear to us to be quite felicitously given.The report was immediately followed on the 30th June by a letter from the Cardinal Secretary of State to the Bishops of Malta and Gozo, stating that on the occasion of a Maltese pilgrimage to Eome the Bishops should come prepared to inform the Holy Father about the grave questions in Malta, and that in view of the painful state of affairs the Holy Father could not longer be silent. The Cardinal Secretary of State added : &quot; it is clear that His Holiness will not fail to do all in his power by encouragement and moral support, to put an end to a line of action harmful to Religion and to the superior authorities in Malta, for which the people have ever shown such cordial respect.&quot;The Diplomatic Correspondence.On the 2nd July the Cardinal Secretary of State sent a note to the British Minister forwarding a copy of his letter of the 30th June to the Bishops and a summary of a Memorandum sent to the Holy See from eyewitnesses of the activities of Lord Strickland in Malta. In his note the Cardinal Secretary of State said : &quot; The object of the letter is evidently to make known to the Maltese people that Lord Strickland is not a -persona grata to the Holy See, as he would himself claim to be, and that the Holy See gives entire support to the action of the Ordinaries of Malta and of Gozo in their censure of Lord Strickland&apos;s activity against the Catholic Church and the Ecclesiastical Authorities of the Island.&quot; He suggested that the matter should be brought to the knowledge of the British Government, since, in view of the harm which Lord Strickland was causing to the Imperial Government, the latter would surely take the measures which it judged necessary to. put an end to such subversive conduct (nociva attivita), or at least to discriminate between its own responsibility and that of Lord Strickland.The Aide-memoire.The enclosure in the Cardinal&apos;s letter has been called the &quot; Aide-memoire,&quot; which was understood to be a compilation based on the reports of Mgr. Robinson, Father Orlich (Superior General of the Conventual Franciscans), and others. It was a document com-municated, in the course of confidential conversations, by the
Vatican to the British Legation as to reports they had received from sources worthy of attention. In the following quotation from the document, we have omitted a short sentence alleging that Lord Strickland was fomenting class hatred, and have inserted in italics some words which appear to reproduce the Italian original more correctly than the translation in the White Book.&quot; From information which has reached the Holy See and which is founded on data collected, as is known, on the spot, it is evident that the present situation in the Island of Malta is exceedingly grave. It appears in fact that Lord Strickland, who is not in power by nomination of the Imperial Govern-ment, but by the mandate of the people, is going beyond the terms of this mandate by showing no regard whatever for the law, nor for the rights and feelings of the clergy and of the Catholic people. Reliable witnesses do not hesitate to say that at the present moment Malta is being subjected to a reign of terror and despotism. The Opposition in Parliament is dis-armed, its press gagged, the law-courts threatened, justice suspended, the Constitution in danger, the country in a state of ferment and the Church and Religion openly affronted and attacked. The same witnesses state that, although Lord Strickland poses as a champion of British Imperial prestige, in reality he is acting contrary to the best traditions of the Empire, and injuring its true interests. The anti-clerical and anti-Maltese campaign undertaken by him has already created very serious discontent and disorder which may be followed in a short time by most distressing consequences.&quot;The contents of this document and the suggestion of the Cardinal Secretary of State caused a climax.As has been stated, a copy of the Aide-memoire was sent on the 2nd July by the Cardinal Secretary of State to the British Minister, in the middle of negotiations. The Minister handed a copy to Lord Strickland, and Lord Strickland published it. It does not appear to us that this document should have been published during the course of negotiations.The British Governments Reply.The reply of the British Government which was conveyed to the Cardinal Secretary of State by the British Minister on the 8th August was certainly conceived in very emphatic and strong terms, which we cannot consider to have been calculated to lead to an amicable understanding. The statement contained the following passage : &quot; The Holy See has seen fit to bring to an abrupt end and without previous warning or explanation negotiations initiated
by Mgr. Robinson in Malta, and which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment hoped would result in a definite agreement between the Holy See and His Majesty&apos;s Government for the settlement on a satisfactory basis of the relations between Church and State in Malta. This is an act which His Majesty&apos;s G-government cannot but consider as both discourteous to themselves and unjustified by the circumstances. But apart from the regrettable and unexpected interruption of the negotiations there are three aspects of the case to which they desire more particularly to call attention.&quot; In the first place, the Holy See has declared to be persona non grata the head of a responsible Government in a British Colony. It appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government incompatible with the existence of friendly diplomatic relations between the Holy See and themselves that the former should treat as persona non grata a Minister exercising executive functions in British territory in virtue of the Constitution of that territory. His Majesty&apos;s Government have learned of the Vatican&apos;s attitude towards the head of the Maltese Ministry with pain and surprise. They cannot suffer themselves without expostula-tion to be exposed, in the person of an executive Minister in one of the British Colonies, to such a slight   .   .   .   .&quot;&quot; In the second place, the Holy See has without previous warning or consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government issued public and explicit instructions to the Maltese Episcopate and through them to the Maltese clergy which, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, constitute a direct incitement to discredit and even to resist the freely and constitutionally elected Government of that Colony. Such interference in the domestic politics of a British Colony is repugnant to the elementary principles of public law. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment must protest against this act most strongly, and desire to make it clear that an interference of this nature must meet with their strongest reprobation.&quot; Thirdly, the Holy See . . . has requested His Majesty&apos;s Government to restrain the activities and to disavow the policy of the Maltese Ministry. As the Holy See is doubtless aware, the Maltese Ministry rest on the support of [a] legislature&quot;&apos; elected by popular franchise. If their actions have been illegal the ordinary remedies have been open to any persons who regard themselves as aggrieved. If they have been politically unwise or inexpedient the remedy lies with the electorate. . . . His Majesty&apos;s Government might reasonably have expected that the Holy See, before issuing its instructions of the 30th June to the Maltese hierarchy, and before requesting His Majesty&apos;s Government to condemn the
policy of the Maltese Ministry, would have availed itself of the negotiations already initiated by Mgr. Robinson, in order to explore with His Majesty&apos;s Government the possibility of a settlement of the difficulties existing between Church and State in Malta. Instead of this the Vatican has preferred to prejudge by its action the very questions which the Apostolic Delegate had at the request of His Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment been sent to Malta to investigate.&quot;This long statement closed with an earnest appeal that the Holy See would observe moderation, consideration and restraint. Its concluding words were : -If, on the present occasion, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel constrained to make it clear that they must needs view any departure from this policy on the part of the Holy See with serious misgivings and grave demur, it is precisely because they value so highly those frank and cordial relations which they have been fortunate enough to establish with the Holy See and which they wish if possible to see maintained and fortified.&quot;The Attitude of the Vatican.The Cardinal Secretary of State replied, on the 10th August, that the Holy See was painfully surprised to find in the British statement simply and solely the views of Lord Strickland, and that therefore frequently either the facts were not accurately recorded or the views expressed did not correspond to the truth. The Vatican Pro-memoria dealt at length with the inquiries of Father Orlich, Mgr. Robinson and others, and contained the following allusion to the publication of the Aide-memoire : &quot; . . . . the Holy See with delicate consideration sent a copy of the letter [to the Maltese Bishops] to the British Minister and with it a note to the Government of His Britannic Majesty with a short summary drawn up from the reports which had reached the Holy See from the reliable sources above mentioned. A verbatim report of this diplomatic Note and the Memorandum attached was published through Lord Strickland&apos;s agency in the English and Maltese newspapers to the surprise of the Holy See. It is undeniable that this in-opportune publication contributed not a little to render the already serious situation still more difficult; but it is also evident that the Holy See was in no way to be blamed in the matter.&quot;The Pro-memoria continued : &quot; .... if the Holy See in a diplomatic document addressed to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government declared that
Lord Strickland is not a persona grata this does not show any want of respect towards the Government itself, but simply a statement which certainly corresponds to the truth from the re-ligious point of view; that is to say, that the work of Lord Strickland in Malta as head of the Ministry is gravely injurious to the interests of Catholicism, and that therefore such a person cannot be grata to the Holy See. It is likewise clear that the Holy See has no intention of interfering in the internal politics of a British Colony and still less of inciting the Bishops to an illegal resistance to constituted authority; on the contrary it was the undue and ever increasing interference of Lord Strick-land in a purely religious domain which forced the Holy See to encourage the Bishops in their attitude of firm adherence to then- duty .... the Holy See could not continue the inter-change of notes, hardly begun, with reference to a projected Concordat to be entered into, to regulate the religious situation in Malta; nor can it resume them until convinced that Lord Strickland means to respect the rights of the Church and show due consideration for the local Ecclesiastical Authorities.&quot;Diplomatic Negotiations Suggested.On the 5th October the British Government replied that they trusted that on further consideration the Vatican might come to share the view that the best and indeed the only constitutional way of putting an end to the present strained relations between Church and State in Malta was &quot; by initiating negotiations through the diplomatic channel with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, who are responsible for the direction of the foreign affairs of Malta. Meanwhile, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, the decision of the Holy See renders useless the continuance of a discussion on the present basis   .   .   .   .&quot;The Vatican in a Pro-memoria dated the 13th October replied that the Holy See, being exceedingly anxious to see religious peace restored among the inhabitants of Malta, welcomed the proposal, but added : &quot; As a starting point for the said negotiations it will be helpful to keep in mind that the chief, if not the only cause, of the religious disturbance in the Island of Malta has been the anti-clerical attitude taken up by Lord Strickland from the moment of his arrival. This being the case, it is difficult to see how peace and religious tranquillity can be restored so long as the cause of the trouble remains.&quot;On the 20th December, the British Minister, in a statement handed to the Cardinal Secretary of State, said that Your Majesty&apos;s Government took note of the assurance that the Holy- See was ready to initiate negotiations with them through the diplomatic
channel on the subject of the Church in Malta, and had instructed the Minister to return to Borne and discuss verbally with the Cardinal Secretary of State the procedure with regard to the con-templated negotiations, re-stating the view that &quot; in the opinion of Plis Majesty&apos;s Government, disregard of the rule against priests indulging in political agitation and the intense participation of the Maltese priests in local politics lay at the root of the present trouble.&quot; The statement proceeded : &quot; This view His Majesty&apos;s Government still maintain, and they cannot, therefore, admit that the &quot; principal, if not the sole, cause of the disturbed religious conditions in Malta has been the anti-clerical attitude of Lord Strickland &quot; as suggested in the Pro-memoria of the 13th October.&quot;The Archbishop&apos;s Address.It might have seemed that the difficulty could be quietly nego-tiated, but on the 11th December, 1929, the Archbishop delivered to the parish priests and provincials, a long address, published in the papers on the 17th December, in which he spoke of the address of the Holy Father delivered to the pilgrims of Malta and Gozo in the previous August, and, after referring to the visit of the Apostolic Delegate, said : &quot; Now we come to the practical part. The rule of the Church, as confirmed by the Holy Father, regarding political action is this : there should be no political action in favour of this or that party; but, however, in all your actions you must follow the action of the bishop; you must do as he directs. In our case His Holiness has said : a certain Minister is not persona grata with us. The Pope refused to receive him, notwithstanding many insistences, and will not receive him until he give signs of sincere repentance. So have I also done recently. On my arrival in Malta I sent word to the Head of the Ministry that I should not receive him until he gave signs of sincere repentance. It has been said that I refused to receive him in audience. This is not exact; I only thought it prudent to forestall such an affront so as to avoid unpleasant incidents.Now, what attitude should we take up in our case? A negative attitude. Whoever of you, or of our clergy, after the words of the Holy Father, dared to say still that this Government has been badly treated by the Pope or that the Government is right in the religious question, would show himself a bad Catholic and as such will incur the canonical penalties. I shall not fail, in all severity, to take the most drastic measures provided in the sacred canons, because it is scandalous to see priests taking an attitude contrary to that
of the bishop and to that of the Holy Father. I greatly regret to know that there are also religious who criticise the Pope&apos;s action. These, if they continue in this deplorable attitude, shall be reported to their superiors general. We hope that the necessity will not arise &quot;.After some conversation had been exchanged between the Cardinal Secretary of State and the British Minister, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on the 1st February, 1930, informed the Governor that Your Majesty&apos;s Government, who were anxious to do all in their power to preserve a serene atmosphere in which to conduct negotiations, were willing to endeavour to obtain, if possible, from the Vatican a pronouncement regarding the partici-pation of priests in politics, if an undertaking could be furnished in return to the effect that Lord Strickland on his side would, as far as he was able, restrain his supporters from making provocative utterances during the negotiations. The Secretary of State added :  &quot; From now onwards it is essential that everything should be done to allow the atmosphere to calm down &apos;&apos;.On the 12th February, the Maltese Ministers informed the Gov-ernor that theyhad enjoined their supporters &quot;in most earnest terms, which will be repeated and upheld by the sanctions available in the party organization, to observe the attitude desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; and would convey fresh injunctions to their supporters urging increased caution. They added a memor-andum that they would consider themselves free from pledges if a dissolution took place before the pronouncement of the Vatican was made or should there be further developments of such forth-coming attacks as were indicated in the address of the Archbishop to the parish priests.Meanwhile, on the 29th January, the Cardinal Secretary of State had handed to the British Minister a Pro-memoria on the activities of Lord Strickland in Malta, giving alleged instances of anti-clerical policy, and, on the 7th February, the British Minister had pointed out to the Cardinal Secretary of State that it was over three months since the Vatican had expressed their willing-ness to negotiate and that nothing had happened so far.Failure of the Diplomatic Discussions.Conversations proceeded in Borne and were reported to London. In one, on the 7th Mai-ch, the Cardinal Secretary of State expressed his regret at not being able to meet the wishes of Your Majesty&apos;s Government and said that the Holy See could not feel any con-fidence in Lord Strickland&apos;s promise &quot; they could only judge by deeds, and would leave the matter in general to the discretion of
the bishops &quot;. In another conversation, on the 14th March, the Cardinal Secretary of State said that he could tell the Minister quite frankly &quot; that no negotiations for a concordat were possible as long as Lord Strickland was in power. The Pope had said so quite definitely &quot;.The British Government again repeated that their view was that &quot; the primary and essential object of the negotiations was, and still is, the exclusion of the Maltese priesthood from local politics and only incidentally, as part of the major question, the examination of the accusations which the Vatican have since made against Lord Strickland, and which, in any case, cannot be put forward as a justification of the political activities of the Maltese clergy &quot;.On the 26th March, the Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs informed the British Minister that the Governor of Malta had been instructed to inform Lord Strickland that, the Vatican having refused to issue instructions to the Maltese clergy, his undertaking might be considered to have lapsed, and that the Cardinal Secretary of State might be so informed.On the 10th April, the British Minister handed to the Cardinal a statement to the effect that Your Majesty&apos;s Government regretted that the Vatican refused to co-operate with them for the purpose of endeavouring to reach a settlement on the question of the rela-tions between Church and State in Malta, and were surprised at the Vatican&apos;s refusal to give an undertaking reciprocal to that given by Ministers that &quot; no further polemics with the ecclesiastical authorities should take place during the forthcoming electoral cam-paign &quot;. The statement went on to say that Your Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment could not refrain from &quot; considering as a discourtesy to themselves the action of the Vatican in expressing distrust of an undertaking given to them by the Head of the Maltese Ministry and sponsored by themselves &quot;, and that &quot; the complete change of attitude oil the part of the Vatican, at a moment when His Majesty&apos;s Government had every reason to suppose that they could count on the Holy See&apos;s close co-operation, renders any continuation of the present discussions useless &apos;&apos;.On the 26th April, the Governor reported to Lord Passfield that the Archbishop had been to Pome and on his return, on the 19th April, had delivered a short address, in which he stated that he had brought from the Pope a message of peace to the people of Malta, and had added that the people might cry &quot; Viva &quot; (Long live!) to whom they liked, but they should not cry &quot; Abasso &quot; (Down with !) to anybody. The Governor reported that this state-ment was welcomed as an indication that the Vatican had instructed the Archbishop to adopt a conciliatory attitude during the elections.
The Visit of Sir A. Bartolo and Mr. Hamilton to Gozo.The news, in the form of a public statement by the Archbishop, was published in the newspapers, and there seemed therefore to be every prospect of a peaceful solution to the electoral crisis. There can be little doubt that an injunction of the kind, coming direct from Rome from the Pope himself, would have been treated with every respect, but the Ministers, after meeting on the 25th April, declared they had received information that the political campaign of the clergy was being accentuated, particularly in Gozo. Two of their members were at once despatched to conduct an inquiry as to the clergy and the confessional in that Island. They would appear to have spent the 26th and 27th April there. These Ministers, Sir Augustus Bartolo, Minister for Education, and Mr. R. Hamilton, Minister for Posts and Labour, stated that they had ascertained that &quot; many cases had occurred in which priests had asked penitents in the confessional whether they intended to vote for the Constitutional Party, and if the answer was in the affirmative had refused them absolution &quot;. The Commissioner of Gozo reported that this had happened to himself, and Sir Augustus Bartolo stated that recently his confessor, a Franciscan monk, refused to hear his confession and said that the monk did so &quot; on account of orders from his superior, the notorious Father Carta &quot;.The Governor reported that Ministers brought this state of affairs to his notice, with the opinion that the clergy were using undue influence, particularly with reference to the confessional, contrary to Electoral Law, which provided the penalty of imprisonment for such an offence, and that they thought the Church was trying to provoke them to retaliation.Effect of the Visit.It may be remarked that Father Carta stated in a memorandum given to us that a monk like himself had no authority to give orders about the confessional, and he did not do so; Canon Law did not allow it. The visit of Sir Augustus Bartolo and Mr. Hamil-ton to Gozo in order to investigate the refusal to give absolution in the confessional caused great resentment in the Roman Catholic Church and counteracted the effect of any peaceful message brought from Rome.The Pastoral Letter.&quot; The Bishops immediately prepared a joint Pastoral Letter, pub-lished on the 1st May, in which the following sentences occur : &quot; And to come to the concrete, and in order not to leave in your souls, any indecision. Know, therefore, as Catholics :  (1) You may not, without committing a grave sin, vote for Lord Strickland and his candidates, or for all those, even of other
parties, who in the past have helped and supported him in his fight against the rights and the discipline of the Church, or who propose to help and support him in the coming elections.(2) For even stronger reasons you may not present yourselves as candidates in the electoral list proposed by Lord Strickland or by other parties who propose to support him in the coming elections.(3) You are also solemnly bound in conscience in the present circumstances to take part in the elections and to vote for those persons who, by their attitude in the past, offer greater guarantee both for religious welfare and for social welfare.In order, then, to prevent abuses in the administra-tion and reception of the Sacraments, we remind our priests that they are strictly forbidden to administer the Sacraments to the obstinate who refuse to obey these instruc-tions. It pains us greatly to see Catholics, guilty of public and grave violation of Catholic discipline, continue freely to approach the Sacraments to the great wonder of the good. It is time that those responsible performed their duty with firmness and without human respect, if they do not wish to draw down the wrath of the Divine Judge.We exhort you again, and we do it with all our paternal heart, to preserve calm, to observe public order and tranquillity, and never to have recourse to violence or provocation &apos;&apos;.This Pastoral was ordered to be made public to the faithful in all the churches on the following Thursday &quot; the first day of the month dedicated to the Virgin Mary, our Mother &quot;.The Ecclesiastical Commentary on the Letter.It should be definitely stated that this Pastoral was not issued with the aid or approval, or at the suggestion of any leaders of the political parties in Malta. The Bishops stated to us that the Pastoral had been issued because in their consciences they deemed it their duty so to act, a statement which we must accept. They also contended, in a letter to the Governor on the 19th May, that their Pastoral had not caused unprecedented excitement, that the assertion that &quot; public safety was imperilled &quot; was utterly inaccurate and misleading, and that the Pastoral did not enjoin upon the people &apos;&apos; to vote for the Nationalists on . religious grounds &quot;. They appealed to the law enacting that &quot; the Roman Catholic Apostolic Religion is, as it ever has been in the past, the Religion of Malta and its Dependencies &quot;. In a Pro-memoria, dated the 19th May, handed to the British Minister, the Cardinal Secre-tary of State said that in the Pastoral Letter &quot; the Bishops do not
mention the Constitutional Party, although they openly mention Lord Strickland and his partisans by name in the struggle against the rights and discipline of the Church : from which it is evident that they do not condemn the Constitutional Party, as far as their programme is concerned, but only refer to those persons who have been notoriously active in a manner harmful to religion &quot;.The Views of the Maltese Government: Suspension of theElection.The Privy Council in Malta, which consists of the Councils of each side of the Dyarchy sitting together, did not hold the same views. They anticipated not only the absence of a free election but also danger of grave disturbances, if the election proceeded. In the result the election was suspended and has not since been pro-ceeded with, and Parliamentary Government has not existed in Malta since June, 1930.The considerations by which the Bishops were guided in issuing the Pastoral appear to us to be especially, (1) the inquiry into the proceedings of the clergy in Gozo, particularly with regard to the confessional, and (2) the events that had taken place with regard to the discipline or rules of a monastic order. In addition, some consideration may have been given to the report of Mgr. Bobinson, which, on the other hand, if correct, was an indication that dis-turbances of a serious kind might be expected, and to the heated words that had been used with regard to members of the clergy in Parliament, particularly an exclamation made in the Legisla-ture by Sir Augustus Bartolo on the 28th August, 1928, that if war was to take place the challenge would be taken up.The British Government proposed to issue a Blue Book with reference to the negotiations, and the Vatican also desired to issue a White Book. The documents published in these two official publications will enable any reader to trace the course of negotia-tions at greater length than it is possible or desirable to give in this Report. From what wTe have extracted it will be seen that Your Majesty&apos;s then Government held that the root of the difficulty lay in the participation of priests in local politics. The Cardinal Secre-tary of State, on the other hand, maintained, as he set forth in a Pro-memoria on the 7th May, that information which reached the Holy See and was verified by most reliable witnesses, expressly sent to Malta, and especially bjr the Apostolic Delegate, had made it clear that the real cause of the unsatisfactory conditions was the attitude of Lord Strickland, Head of the Ministry and Leader of the Constitutional Party.
In the same Pro-memoria of the 7th May, the terms of the pro-posed pre-election truce, which evidently the Cardinal Secretary of State considered to be too one-sided, are mentioned, viz. : (1) There was a merely verbal communication of a promise made by Lord Strickland to the Government; (2) such promise was restricted to not attacking the clergy and not to the whole matter of his activities in the field of religion; (3) it was limited to the period of the electoral campaign, which left it to be inferred that after the elections Lord Strickland would be able to resume his activities injurious to religion ; (4) nothing was said about the supporters of Lord Strickland and of his newspapers (organs so active on his behalf), so that it was by no means to be excluded that the attacks should not be con-tinued by these papers even during the electoral period; (5) no mention was made of an efficacious guarantee on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and much less was any indication given of the object of such a guarantee, i.e., whether His Majesty&apos;s Government guaranteed the simple fact of Lord Strickland&apos;s promise or guaranteed the keeping of such a promise, and it would bs difficult to understand how His Majesty&apos;s Government could give the latter since they had repeatedly declared that they had no power over Lord Strick-land because &apos; the Maltese Ministry rests on the support ofa Legislature elected by popular franchise &apos;.....Whatwas asked as the quid pro quo for the above-mentioned promise of Lord Strickland was that the Holy See should forbid the clergy of Malta to take any active part in politics, more particularly during the time of the electoral campaign : in other words, the Holy See was asked to forbid the clergy of Malta (1) to put up ecclesiastics as candidates for the Legislative Assembly, thus depriving them of the right recog-nised as being theirs both by the Maltese Constitution and (with due limitations) by the codex of the Canon Law; and (2) to oppose the candidature of Lord Strickland.&quot; Such are the terms of the proposed pre-election truce. Now it is clear that, had the Holy See accepted such a proposal, it would have favoured and in a way made certain Lord Strick-land&apos;s electoral triumph, depriving the clergy of a right they possess &quot;.The Bishops&apos; Memorandum.On the 19th May, there followed another Pro-memoria, and on the same date a memorandum by the Archbishop of Malta and the Bishop of Gozo, defending the Pastoral and denying the &quot; gratuitously implied and stressed &quot; points contained in a memorandum of the Maltese Ministers to the Governor, viz.,
131&quot; that the Bishops&apos; Joint Pastoral has &apos; imperilled public safety &apos; by &apos; having engendered an unprecedented excitement &apos; &quot; and that the Bishops&apos; Joint Pastoral &quot; enjoins upon the people to vote for the Nationalists on religious grounds &quot;. The Bishops submitted that the existence of this &quot;abnormal and dangerous situation &quot; in point of fact was as gratuitous as it was unreal; that no &quot;un-precedented excitement &quot; subsequent to the publication of their Joint Pastoral was, as a matter of fact, evident anywhere, and that consequently the assertion made that &quot; public safety was imperilled &quot; was utterly inaccurate and misleading.Deadlock upon &quot; Preceding Conditions.&quot;On the 20th May, the Cardinal Secretary of State, in a Pro-memoria, defended the Holy See against the accusation that the Pastoral of the 1st May, and the support given to it by the Holy See were an interference in the government of a Colony. The Pro-memoria stated : As to the &apos; secular controversy &apos; between the spiritual and the temporal, the Catholic doctrine, from which the Holy See cannot withdraw or depart although always it is disposed to reach a practical accord compatible with the essential prin-ciples of that doctrine is well known and constant. The Holy See has always held, and still holds, that the two complete societies, ecclesiastical and civil, are constituted by God Himself, nor have they ever denied nor wished to compromise in any manner the just rights of the State. And if they are always willing to enter into relations or come to agreements with various Governments they cannot alter the nature of these two societies, nor renounce the essential rights of the Church, just as the State would not renounce its own rights or would not accept an unjust curtailment thereof.&apos;&apos; In conforming with these principles the Holy See again declare themselves ready amicably to negotiate a means for a peaceful settlement of the Maltese question.&quot;But as to the preceding condition which His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government wish to impose,&quot; that the resump-tton of negotiations should be conditional upon orders being given by the Holy See to the episcopal authorities in Malta and Gozo which would restoi-e to the electorate of the Colony complete freedom to exercise their political judgment-&quot; this the Holy See regret their inability to accept; because such action would imply an unjust condemnation and repudia-tipn (&apos; menomazione &apos;) of the Bishops. We say unjust, because the Bishops have acted according to their consciences as pastors in defence of the religious interests entrusted to them.12458 k
And it cannot be said that they have hindered the electors in the full liberty which the exercise of their political rights demands; they have rather wished to safeguard this liberty against the artifices of politicians considered by them and by their people to be adversaries of the Faith and of the public welfare, bearing in mind the moral laws to which that liberty should be subordinated ... it must be remembered, however, that the agitation of minds can never cease, passions will never be calmed nor a genuine peace assured so long as those who have disturbed that peace remain in power alienating from themselves the clergy and the people who have, up to the present, been so faithful and loyal to the British Crown, but also most tenacious of their Catholic Faith and of their ancient religious and civil traditions &quot;.On the 30th May, the British Charge d&apos;Affaires handed a state-ment intimating to the Cardinal Secretary of State, that the British Government regretted that the Holy See had not appre-ciated the necessity of taking practical measures to implement the assurance that the Vatican was disposed always and everywhere to do all in its power so that public peace and tranquillity might be maintained and restored.&quot; Instead of this they have now refused to take, as far as concerns them, the steps necessary for the restoration of a normal political life in Malta, whilst, before that, they had delayed many months the long promised negotiations for de-fining the relations between Church and State in the Islands, and finally rendered them impossible by attaching a condition as to the personality of the Head of the Maltese Administra-tion, which constitutes nothing less than a claim to interfere in the domestic politics of a British ColonyCessation of the Diplomatic Correspondence.After a statement by each party that they intended to publish their own versions, the correspondence ended on the 8th June with a Pro-memoria by the Cardinal Secretary of State, saying that the delay in the negotiations could not be in any way attributed to the Holy See. It was maintained that the Holy See opposed the work of Lord Strickland not on account of political reasons but solely because of his attitude towards religion. The Cardinal Secretary of State considered it proper to appeal to Your Majesty&apos;s Government so that opportune measures should be taken to prevent the harmful activity of Lord Strickland or at least to distinguish between the Governments responsibility and Lord Strickland&apos;.? responsibility.
The Pro-memoria contained the following passages : &quot; The Government of His Britannic Majesty regrets that the Holy See declines to order the Bishops of Malta and of Gbzo to give to the electors of the Colony the full right to exercise their political vote. But the Holy See does not agree with the affirmation as it stated already in its note of May 20th that the Pastoral Letter of the Bishops took away the freedom of the ballot. Because of the attitude of Lord Strickland, the Bishops in accordance with the dictates of their consciences have felt obliged to publish their Pastoral Letter but this publication has not deprived anyone of the freedom of the ballot. It has simply made clear the harm that Lord Strickland was doing to religion. Neither the state-ments of the Bishops nor the precautions adopted by them in the fulfilment of their sacred duty as shepherds of the souls committed to their care in accordance with the voice of con-science, prevent in any way the use of the electoral prerogative but instead they explain the principles which should guide its conscientious use.The Holy See therefore does not perceive that any electoral abnormality is constituted by the Pastoral act of the Bishops of Malta in which they reminded the faithful on the occasion of the election, of those jxrinciples which serve always and everywhere, that Catholics have the duty not to vote for those persons, who, having done injury to the Church in the past, wish afterwards to have the votes of Catholics in order to assure themselves of victory and thus be able to continue their devastating work a,gainst religion . . . Such a defence of the Catholic Faith in Malta can be considered by the Government of His Majesty as an improper political interference even less because this same Government of His Majesty from the beginning of its possession of the Island gave the Maltese people the most ample assurances that the Catholic religion would be protected and defended &quot;.The British Minister, Sir Henry Chilton, having been pro-promoted, no Minister has since been appointed to the Vatican, and the Legation has been in the hands of a Charge d&apos;Affaires.The Papal Allocution of the 30th June, 1930.In leaving this part of the subject, we may refer to the Papal Allocution to the Cardinals in Consistory held on the 30th June, 1930, a few days after the suspension of the Constitution. According to the translation given to us by Mgr. Dandria, the following statement was made in the Allocution : &quot; There remains, in fine, another question, the Maltese question, to which it is absolutely necessary to refer briefly
in this solemn Assembly, almost a Pontifical Senate, that We may not seem to give it little importance, while it is very important in itself dealing as it does (in so much as it concerns Us and as We have given it attention) with high religious interests, that is, with the rights of God and of conscience; as well as because of the principles involved and because it concerns the most noble and eminently Catholic people of Malta; no less important, in fine, because the case had to be discussed (dovette agitarsi) with the supreme Government of the most powerful British Monarch, a Government and a Monarch with whom the Holy See and We ourselves hold diplomatic relations which We earnestly and hopefully wish to see become always more intimate and cordial. The Esposizione Documentata (White Book) of the whole question ... is in your hands ... It is dutiful for Us, however, to take this occasion, as propitious as it is solemn, to reaffirm yet another time, with all clarity and due tespect, three things which undoubtedly emerge from the Esposizione.&quot; The first thing is that not by this Holy See nor by the Maltese Bishops has the present storm been raised. The second thing is that the return,to tranquillity and peace not-withstanding our desire and that of the Bishops a desire as dutiful as it is sincere and effective has been rendered im-possible by persons, by actions and by facts independent from Our will, nay, contrary to it, because they are contrary to the interests of the Catholic religion, of which, in virtue of the supreme apostolic ministry, we have always and everywhere the concern and the responsibility and these the greater in the case of a people so profoundly Catholic as the Maltese. The third thing is that in no instance did Our intervention or that of the Maltese Bishops go down on to political ground and has instead been always limited, as it was strictly bound to be according to the pastoral conscience, to recalling, pro-claiming, and inculcating those principles and those moral laws from which the conduct and the action of Catholics can never depart and which it cannot ignore. And in all this no one can ever reasonably see any undue interference or any diminution of freedom . . . freedom is neither lessened nor restricted by the moral law, which but regulates its use, assigns the boundaries between what is optional and what is licit, and binds freedom to respect those boundaries, but on the contrary freedom is by the moral law protected and saved from degenerating into mere licentiousness. These things are so true and evident that those who would question them would seem to be willing to weaken the very foundations of every sort of order, private and public &quot;.
61133CHAPTER V.-THE DISPUTES IN THE COURT OFAPPEAL.The Legislation of the Strickland Government Impugned.The suspension, on the 3rd May, of the General Election created a difficult situation for the Imperial authorities. The local Privy Council, as is indicated in the foregoing Chapter, anticipated the danger of grave disturbances if the election proceeded; and the Ordinance of the Governor staying the election was issued &quot; in the interests of public safety &quot; and was based upon the provisions of Section 41 (1) of the Constitution Letters Patent of 1921 which reserved matters &quot; touching the public safety and defence &quot; of the Empire. This appears to have been the only provision of the law then existing on which the Governor could base his interven-tion as the legislating authority of the Maltese Imperial Govern-ment. It soon became obvious that the legality of the Ordinance founded on these provisions was likely to be challenged. It was questioned whether local conditions afforded justification for the invocation of a power which could only legally be exercised in the interests of the public safety and defence of the Empire. Further-more, even if such a condition existed it wfould presumably not be lasting. The breakdown of negotiations with the Aratican, implied, however, that there might be a long period in which the &quot; free election &quot; stipulated by Your Majesty&apos;s Government would be un-obtainable; and for any prolonged suspension of the election some more solid legal basis than the Governors Ordinance seemed to be required. It was to resolve this legal difficulty that the Princi-pal Letters Patent were amended by the Letters Patent of the 26th June, 1930, so as to make possible the invocation of the reserved powers in the event of a purely local emergency.Another Reason for Imperial Intervention.There existed, however, another reason for the enactment of die amending Letters Patent and of the subsidiary Order in Council of the 26th June; and it is the purpose of this Chapter to deal with that aspect of the matter. At the time of the suspension of the election there was a case before the local Court of Appeal which raised the issue of the validity of the Electoral Act of 1929. Prom any decision of the Court of Appeal that this Act was not valid there would flow serious consequences from the administra-tive standpoint. It seemed possible that in the event of such a decision a whole series of Acts of the Legislature might be success-fully impugned and that administrative chaos would result. In order to deal with this problem the Governor, on the 21st June,
1930, issued a second Ordinance, No. II of that year, which pur-ported to validate all Acts of the Legislature which had received assent, and all things done under them, and provided that no question as to their validity should be entertained by any Court of Law. It was clear, however, that this Ordinance, which was based upon the same provision of the Constitution as the Ordinance suspending the election, was itself open to challenge^ As there was no local Legislature in existence it appears to have been con-sidered that, in the interests of administrative expediency, further legislative action by the Imperial authorities was necessary. The issue of the amending Letters Patent of the 26th June provided a method of dealing&quot; with the difficulty; and in the resulting Order in Council of the same date a specific provision was inserted validat-ing the Ordinances enacted by the Governor.The Judgment of the Court of Appeal.The Order in Council came into operation in Malta on the 2nd July by local Proclamation. On the 25th June, however, the day before the Letters Patent and the Order in Council were issued in London, the Malta Court of Appeal delivered judgment on the case concerning the validity of the Electoral Act of 1929. This judg-ment calls for notice in some detail. It was one of the salient factors in the Maltese political situation, as it must also be in any consideration of the questions relating to the validity of the laws passed during Lord Strickland&apos;s administration which were much discussed in the evidence before us. It requires comment also, because it involves points of constitutional law which might be of moment not only to Malta but also to the constitutional law affect-ing other colonies. The decision of the Court of Appeal has not been carried before a higher tribunal. At present it remains in being and might become important at least to Malta itself, in which case it is possible the Imperial Government would have to step in, and, either by a higher decision or by an Act of Parliament, deter-mine what powers judges may have in relation to the declaration of the invalidity of laws purporting to have been passed by a Legislature.Important Point of Constitutional Law.It is quite clear from the authorities that the Courts of Law can impugn the validity of laws which infringe the provisions of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, the powers of the Imperial Parliament and the prerogative of the Crown, but we are unaware of any authoritative decision which authorizes a Court of Law to go so far as to declare invalid laws passed by a Legislature months and even years after their promulgation, and to have such immense control over the proceedings of a Legislature, especially when, as is
the case in Malta, the Legislature has passed an Act (No. XXIV of 1924) conferring on itself, in pursuance of permission expressly granted in Section 39 of the Constitution, all the privileges, immunities, or powers enjoyed by the House of Commons.The questions at issue are therefore important. We feel that they are of sufficient interest to justify the insertion, at this point of our Report, of a summary of the judgment delivered by the Chief Justice in the Malta Court of Appeal and preliminary judgments connected with it which bear on the subject of the control of the Courts over the proceedings of the Legislature. The judgments are long and the matter is technical. We have, however, endeavoured to make the summary as brief as possible, and to bring-out only the salient points. It should be stated that the judgments were delivered in Italian, and that the quotations from them given in English in the following paragraphs are transcribed from the certified translation from the Italian, received from Malta.Summary of Preliminary Judgments.On the 11th April, 1930, a sitting of the Court of Appeal was held in the case of G. M. Gocjgi v. E. A. Mifsud, before Sir A. Mercieca, Chief Justice and President of the Court of Appeal, Dr. E. Buhagiar, and Professor Dr. E. Ganado, the Court having decreed on the 27th March that the case be heard urgently.In the Writ of Summons the Plaintiff alleged that Act No. I of 1929, purporting to amend the Constitution as required by the Letters Patent of 192S in respect of voting powers, was not passed in conformity with the Letters Patent of 1921, as amended by Letters Patent dated the 1st August, 1928, and that the vacancy caused by the resignation of Joseph Micallef was invalidly filled by the co-option of the Defendant Mifsud as a member of the Legislative Assembly on the 3rd February, 1930, the procedure for filling casual vacancies having been taken under the Regulations made under the Act of 1929 and not, as it should have been, under the Regula-tions of Act XIV of 1924 relating to casual vacancies. It was prayed that, in view of this and other reasons, an Order be made declaring the election of Mifsud to fill the vacancy for the Eighth Electoral District null and void, and that the Defendant had no right to be or remain a Member of the legislative Assembly.Mifsud replied that he had resigned his seat and that consequently the Plaintiffs interest in contesting and the Defendants interest in upholding the validity of the election had lapsed. Lord Strick-land, in his capacity as Head of the Ministry and Minister for Justice, filed a similar plea.
A further plea was filed by the Defendants respecting the Plaintiffs incapacity to sue the Court on the alleged ground that the so-called popular action in electoral cases was no longer within the competence of the public.The Court of Appeal heard these two preliminary pleas and held that every citizen was entitled to bring an appropriate action seek-ing to annul a political election, that the Courts had invariably upheld the existence of the common right to sue in election dis-putes on each and every occasion that such right was brought into question, and that the interest on the part of the Plaintiff had not abated by the resignation of Mifsud.In his judgment the Chief Justice cited many cases in Malta and Great Britain and held that, if the election of Mifsud as successor to Giuseppe Micallef (resigned) was to be declared null and of no effect, the vacancy would have to be considered as never having been filled and it would be necessary to fill it in accordance with the procedure and within the term prescribed for a first casual vacancy, that is to say, by the nomination of candidates who might present themselves for election otherwise than by co-option, but, conversely, if the election of Armando Mifsud was to be considered as having been valid, the vacancy occasioned in the same seat by the resignation of the Defendant Mifsud would constitute a second casual vacancy of the same seat to be filled forthwith by co-option. It was also held that the interest of ascertaining whether at that moment there existed a first casual vacancy, which was not validlv filled, or a second casual vacancy, had not ceased and was suffi-cient to support the claims put forward. The Court accordingly-disallowed the preliminary pleas respecting the incapacity on the part of the Plaintiff to sue and the lapse of interest, and directed that the case was further to be heard.On the 14th April the Court held that the case should be con-tinued as an urgent matter and that the Easter vacations should be dispensed with. On the 17th April the Senate and Legislative Assembly were dissolved.On the 19th April the Defendants raised two further preliminary-pleas, namely, that the dissolution of both Houses of the Legis-lature had the effect of stopping automatically the course of every election petition having for its object the ascertainment of the validity or otherwise of an election, and that the dissolution had also the effect of putting an end to the interest which, on the 11th April, the Court had declared to appertain to the Plaintiff.On the 12th May the Court held that :-&quot; Whoever sues is entitled, besides to a reparation for the violation of his right, also and principally to a declaration as to the existence of his right, in default of which his right might
be again ignored and trampled upon, and consequently he has an interest in the action and such interest continues to exist until the object of the action is reached, that is to say, the affirmation of his right which has been interfered with.&quot;The Court held that, although the claim to remove the Defendant Mifsud from his seat was exhausted by his resignation and the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly, the Plaintiff had still ah interest to continue his action, and said that the Plaintiff was exercising the so-called popular or public action, and that therefore his interest referred to the whole collectivity (? community) to whom it was of the utmost importance to ascertain, by means of the inquiry into the election of the Defendant Mifsud, which of the two contending laws, the Act of 1924 or the Act of 1929, should govern the elections. No practice or provision of law, as in England, that the dissolution automatically stqpped the course of an electoral case having for its object the decision of a question concerning the validity or otherwise of an election, enjoined the Court to conform itself thereto. The ample and exclusive power conferred upon the Court of Appeal by Section 33 of the Maltese Constitution, 1921, to deal with and decide all questions which might arise as to the right of any person to be or to remain a member of the Senate or Legislative Assembly, was a contrast to the limited powers vested in English judges by various Acts. For these reasons the Court rejected the further pleas submitted by the Defendants, with the object of staying the course of the proceedings as a result of the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly.On the 22nd June the Defendants urged that it was a difficult and delicate question to pronounce judgment upon the nullity of laws said to have been passed by the Legislature and assented to by the Governor, and to decide the question as to whether the Courts enjoyed the necessary jurisdiction to determine thereupon. They put in a plea that the question should not and could not be decided by the Court of Appeal in virtue of its jurisdiction in electoral matters but should be held over pending the discussion of, and the decision upon the principal claim brought forward by- the Plaintiff, that is to say, until such time as the Plaintiff on a relative action brought in the competent Court of ordinary jurisdiction secured judgment declaring the nullity of the laws.Judgment delivered by Chief Justice.On the 25th June the Chief Justice delivered the decision of the Court, in a very lengthy judgment, of which the more salient points may be mentioned.
The Chief Justice stated that the Defendants&apos; assumption did not appear to be borne out either by the letter or by the spirit of the law, and he again cited Section 33 of the Constitution Letters Patent, saying : The phraseology in which that clause is formulated is of such arrijplitude and comprehensiveness that it must logically be held to include any controversy or any conflicting point, of whatever nature, whether of fact or law, legal or constitu-tional, principal, collateral or incidental, preliminary to or concerning the merits, without exception whatsoever.&quot;After citing certain opinions given by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, he added :  &quot; The intentions of the legislator who created such special jurisdiction would be frustrated, and electoral cases would be subjected, to serious and disastrous delays, if this Court, upon the presentation of any question that appears delicate and important, were to withhold judgment until proceedings are instituted in the ordinary Courts, during all the stages of appeal to the Court of Appeal as an ordinary Court of second instance, and until a definite pronouncement is obtained from His Majesty&apos;s Privy Council.&quot;The Question of Competence.On the plea that it was not within the competence of the Judiciary to determine the validity or the nullity of laws enacted by the Legislature, the Chief Justice cited Italian treatises ou consti-tutional law and Italian commentators (admitting that com-mentators held divergent views) on Civil Law and differentiated an alleged similarity between the Maltese Legislature and the Imperial Parliament. He quoted Dicey, Bryce, Anson, Keith&apos;s &quot; The Sovereignty of the British Dominions,&quot; Todd&apos;s &quot; Parliamentary Government in the British Colonies,&quot; Sir H. Jenkins&apos; &quot; British Rule and Jurisdiction beyond the Seas,&quot; and several English cases, and concluded that the Courts of a self-governing colony have of necessity a function not found in their prototype, the function of deciding on the validity as well as the meaning of Colonial Statutes. He cited the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865 (28 and 29 Vic. Ch. 63), and particularly the fifth Section, which laid clown :-&quot; Every representative legislature shall, in respect to the Colony under its jurisdiction, have, and be deemed at all times to have had,full power to make laws respecting the constitution, powers, and procedure of such legislature; provided that such laws shall have been passed in such manner and form as may
from time to time be required by any Act of Parliament, Letters Patent, Order in Council, or Colonial Law for the time being in force in the said Colony.&quot;And he emphasized the proviso.The Chief Justice remarked : &quot; The reference made to the powers and restrictions of our Parliamentary autonomy suffices to make it convincing that the local Legislature undoubtedly belongs to the category of &apos; non-sovereign law-making bodies,&apos; or to the category of &apos; sub-ordinate &apos; or &apos; rigid &apos; constitutions, of which English writers speak, and which do not enjoy the peculiar latitude inherent to the British Parliament to legislate in the widest manner possible, and with equal ease and sameness of form and pro-cedure, in respect of all matters imaginable, with powers ex-tending beyond its territorial confines, without distinction between fundamental and ordinary laws, and without any executive, legislative, or judicial person or body being able to pronounce invalid any one of its laws or regulations.&quot;He then argued as follows :  &apos;&apos; Having established the fact that the privileges and powers of our Legislature are circumscribed by a series of statutory limitations that .... concern the relations with the Imperial Government, those between the two sides of the Dyarchy, and those between the two Houses, as well as the formalities that are to support all legislative enactments of whatever nature  having established this fact beyond question, it emerges as a logical consequence that in order that those restrictions, and the provisions that impose the same, should not become a dead letter, they must be accompanied as they are in actual fact, by the penalty of nullity, without which it would be easy to ignore them and openly to violate them .... It is likewise a legitimate conclusion to arrive at that in order to render such penalties effective, to repress excesses and keep within the limits established by the Constitution to the exercise of the respective powers of the State, and to define disputes and questions that arise, a neutral and independent body, that has the power and the jurisdiction to determine, by appropriate means and safeguards, alleged violations of the Constitution, substantial or affecting procedure, and to pronounce the penalty contemplated therefor, is indispensable and impellent, and such body cannot be other than the Judiciary, to whom, in the distribution of the powers of the State, is entrusted the ex-clusive task of ensuring the proper observance and application of all laws, definitely determining all controversies that may arise, of whatever kind and at whatever time.&quot;
The Chief Justice further deduced that : &quot; The clause vetoing adjudication upon the validity of laws enacted by the Governor, on the advice and with the consent of the Council of Government in cases of disregard of the Royal Instructions, having failed to be repeated in the Letters Patent of 1921, it is legitimate to conclude that, under the new Con-stitution, such adjudication is permissible, even when com-plaints are lodged that the prescribed formalities for the enact-ment of laws have been violated,&quot;and that : &quot; Courts of Justice, when called upon to apply a law in concrete cases of violation of the personal rights of citizens, cannot be denied the power to ascertain and determine whether such law is valid, that is to say, whether it has been enacted by the instrument vested with the powers to enact it, and whether the prescribed formalities and regulations have been observed.&quot;Ordinances ol the Governor held to be ultra vires.The Chief Justice referred to three Maltese cases in support of that proposition. He admitted that, if Ordinance No. II of 1930, providing that : &quot; All Acts enacted or purported to have been enacted by the Legislature of Malta which have received the assent of His Majesty in Council or which have received the assent of the Governor in the name and on behalf of His Majesty, shall be and be deemed to have been valid and effectual .... and no question as to the validity of any such laws or of anything done thereunder shall be entertained by any Court of Law,&quot;were held to be valid in all its bearings, it would dislodge the grounds on which it was sought to secure a declaration of nullity, and the election of the Defendant Mifsud would have taken place in conformity with a law that was not suspect of nullity and could not be impugned. He stated, however, that it was incumbent upon the Court, in view of the nature of the two laws, No. I of 1929, having for its object the amendment of the Constitution as required by the Letters Patent of 1928, in respect of voting powers, and the Electoral Act, No. XXVI of 1929, and in view of the source from which the said Ordinance emanated, to determine whether the very recent Ordinance of the Governor, in so far as it was designed to render valid those Acts, had been ordained within the ambit of the powers conferred upon the Governor by the Constitution on which it was based, or whether it showed to be in excess of such powers, ultra vires, and consequently null and not binding.
The Chief Justice found that the upshot was that the Governor, in validating Act No. I of 1929, exceeded the constitutional powers conferred upon hirn, amongst which the power to amend the Con-stitution was not included, and that Ordinance No. II of 1930, by which the Governor purported to validate that Act, must be deemed to have been promulgated ultra vires by one who was not vested with the powers to do it, contrary to the Constitution, and it must be considered pro tanto null and not binding (inatten-dibile). He added (according to the certified translation from the Italian) : &quot; It must further be held to have been issued ultra vires in so far as it debars the Court from taking into consideration any plea impugning the nullity of the said Act No. 1 of 1929, in-asmuch as such a provision amounts to an indirect attempt to render that Act effective, if it lacks such effectiveness, precluding that it be discussed and that its nullity be judicially pronounced, and, if it is not within the powers of the Imperial side of the Maltese Dyarchy to amend the Constitution directly, it is not within its power to amend it indirectly.&quot;Proceeding to deal with the Electoral Law of 1929, the Chief Justice found that there was no element in that Act which, during or after the period of the so-called state of emergency, could be qualified as affecting reserved matters and consequently as coming within the legislative power of the Governor, and therefore Ordinance No. II of 1930, in so far as it tended to validate the Electoral Act, if judicially annulled, was to he deemed pro tanto contrary to the Constitution and issued ultra vires, and the same was to be said of the Ordinance in so far as it debarred the Court from taking cognizance of lawsuits relative to the nullity of the Act. He found that the plea finally submitted by the Defendants, that the question of the validity or nullity of Act No. I of 1929 could not be discussed and decided, was not maintainable, and if the Electoral Law of 1929, which purported to revoke that of 1924, was declared to have been passed illegally and unconstitu-tionally, the fact of having been nominated in accordance with the Electoral Act of 1929, without an opportunity being given to the candidates defeated at the general elections, or to one of such candidates, to enter their or his candidature for the vacancy created by the resignation of Dr. Micallef, within the longer term fixed by the Electoral Act of 1924, was sufficient and adequate ground for declaring Mifsud&apos;s election null and void.The Chief Justice then reviewed the facts with regard to the difficulty of the Government in passing a Money Bill, the amend-ment made by the Letters Patent of 1928 to Section 41 of the Letters Patent of 1921, with the object of altering the majority necessary in cases of disagreement between the Lower and the Upper Houses, the effort of the Government, on the 9th August,
1928, to pass the law for that purpose required by the amending Letters Patent, the rejection of the Bill by the Senate on the 10th September, 1928, the prorogation of the Legislature on the 26th October, 1928, and the convocation of a new session fixed for the 26th November, 1928.The Chief Justice recited the objections taken by the Opposition, in December of 1928 and January of 1929, to the two Senators sitting and voting, and the various steps that the Opposition took with a view to defeating their action, to which allusion has already been made. He mentioned the number of votes by which the decisions of the Senate were taken and the votes that had been cast by Mifsud and Borg, leading up to the passing of the thirteen laws at the sitting convened on the 26th July, 1929, which the members of the Opposition abstained from attending.The Chief Justice then stated that the &quot; pretext &quot; by which Mifsud and Borg had sat and voted in the House after the 4th December, 1928, owing to the special leave to appeal to the Privy Council, granted on the 20th November, 1928, was inadmis-sible.   He said : &quot;It is called a pretext, inasmuch as it was and is still a juridically inadmissible claim that they entertained that they were entitled to take an active part in the business of the Senate and the Legislative Assembly, and to influence events by their votes, solely because, after that this Court the only competent Court vested with powers by the Constitution to adjudicate thereupon had pronounced their election null and void, a special leave to appeal was pending before His Majesty&apos;s Privy Council.&quot;The Chief Justice said that the principle of the Maltese law, sanctioned by Article 292 of the Laws of Civil Procedure and established in a case determined on the 17th November, 1924, was that an appeal did not stay the execution of a sentence, whether it was an appeal proper or special leave to appeal. He cited several cases decided in England and alluded to some remarks made by members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He also mentioned Section 66 of the Electoral Act of 1924, which was in force at the time, stating that it precluded Mifsud and Borg from sitting and voting at the time when judgment was pending before the Court, and quoting its terms as follows : &apos;&apos; Pending the settlement of any question which may accord-ing to law be brought before His Majesty&apos;s Court of Appeal concerning the validity of an election, no person whose election is disputed may demand that the oath or the solemn affirmations-tion or declaration prescribed by Section 27 of the Malta Con-stitution Letters Patent of 1921 be administered to him, nor shall he take his seat as a Member of the Senate or of the Legislative Assembly, as the case may be.&quot;
The Chief Justice said that Section 34 (2) of the Constitution Letters Patent, which debarred any member of the Legislature from renouncing his seat without the permission of the House to which he belonged, whilst proceedings were pending in respect of his election, if it was alleged in such proceedings that any corrupt or illegal practices took place at the election, or while any proceed-ings were contemplated or pending in respect of his conduct in or as a member of either House, was governed by the Electoral Act of 1924 and applied only to corrupt and illegal practices or in respect of a member&apos;s conduct in or as a member of either House, and that, in any event, after the pronouncement of the 14th August, 1928, Mifsud and Borg could not sit solely because the President of the Senate did not consider it opportune to stop them, on the ground that the question was still sub judice. He also stated that the ruling of Mr. Hamilton, who presided at the sitting, which was counter to the pronouncement of the Court of Appeal that Mifsud and Borg were invalidly elected, was to be deemed ultra vires. Further, Act No. XXIV of 1924, which conferred upon the Legis-lative Assembly and the members thereof the privileges, immunities-ties, and powers of the House of Commons and its members, had to be reconciled with the Constitution and could not be made to clash with Section 33 of the Letters Patent of 1921 and Section 66 of the Electoral Act of 1924 passed by the Legislature.&quot;It thus remains established&quot;, the Chief Justice said, &quot; that Armando Mifsud, Legal Procurator, and Michelangelo Borg had no right whatever to be considered Members of the Senate and in such capacity to sit and vote at the sitting of the 8th January, 1929, inasmuch as they had been divested of such right by a sentence of this Court given on the 14th August, 1928, the execution of which had not been stayed. In conse-ouence thereof the votes recorded by them at that Sitting in favour of the proposed Law to amend Section 42 (3) and Section 61 of the Letters Patent of 1921 relative to the Con-stitution of Malta, subsequently entitled Act No. 1 of 1929, were given invalidly and were productive of no effect &quot; (? were ineffective).The Chief Justice said that the assent of the Governor, the lapse of one year without the exercise of the power of disallowance, and the certificate of the Clerk of the Legislature attesting a true copy of the Law could not validate the Law, and he affirmed the result to be : &quot;... that which is known as the Electoral Act No. XXVI of 1929 must be deemed to have been rejected by the legislature ,.\ although it figures as having been passed, and must be declared vitiated by nullity and therefore of no effect. Another infer-ence is that the Electoral Act of 1924, which it had been pro-posed to repeal by Article 2 of the Electoral Act of 1929, was
not validly repealed, and continued, as it still continues, to have full force and effect. And the foregoing leads to a final conclusion, namely, that the election by co-option of Defendant Armando Mifsud, Legal Procurator, to represent the Eighth Electoral District following the resignation of Giuseppe Micallef, M.D.,-having been made on the 3rd February, 1930, on the basis of and in accordance with the term fixed by the Electoral Act of 1929, which has been unconstitutionally and invalidly passed, when such election should have been earned out in conformity with the Electoral Act of 1924, and under the longer term fixed by the said Act, which, as has been seen, could have given a different result, that is, the non-election of the said Armando Mifsud, Legal Procurator, must be deemed illegal and invalid &quot;.The formal decision was to allow the Plaintiffs claims and to decide : &quot; (1) declaring null and void and of no effect Act No. I of 1929 amending the Letters Patent relative to the Constitution of Malta and the Electoral Act of 1929 (No. XXVI of 1929), the said Acts not having been legally validated by Ordinance No. II of 1930 ;(2) declaring null and void and of no effect the election of Defendant Armando Mifsud, Legal Procurator, as Member of the Legislative Assembly representing the Eighth Electoral District, which took place on the 3rd February, 1930, and declaring that he has had no right to be or remain a Member of that Assembly, and(3) condemning Defendants to pay all those costs of the present litigation in regard to which no provision was made in the preceding decisions &quot;.The Chief Justice&apos;s Statement to the Commission.The electoral decisions and particularly this judgment of the Court of Appeal have been strongly attacked, on the platform, in the Legislature, and in the Press, so strongly that the Chief Justice at the end of his evidence made the following statement to the Commission : &quot; May I be allowed to make one final short statement? I have been informed that the Courts have been mentioned before this Commission by some of the witnesses who have appeared before you so far, and charges of being biased have been made against the Bench. These charges were also made, under cover of Parliamentary immunity, in both the Senate and the Legisla-tive Assembly.   I am not going to set up a defence.   Perhaps
1 may be permitted to state that some of the judgments which, when they were delivered, were said to be biased in the Legisla-tive Assembly, were quoted on subsequent occasions in support of arguments or actions by those who had pronounced them to be biased. . . . We could not defend ourselves, but, in the name of my colleagues and myself, I take advantage of the privilege of appearing before the representatives of the King to lodge a protest against such charges made against persons who are trying, sometimes under difficult circumstances, to administer the law to the best of their knowledge and ability, and under the sole dictates of their conscience.&quot;The Arguments adduced against the Judgment.The chief arguments adduced by various critics against the judgment of the Court of Appeal may be briefly stated as follows. The Court, it was argued, had assumed greater power than it possessed and had unduly impinged upon the rights of the Legisla-ture in a self-governing colony. The quotation that &quot; the every essence of the English Constitution is the unlimited authority of Parliament &quot; was adduced, and it was stated that the Colonial Laws Validity Act established the principle that, subject to the limits expressed in the Act, colonial laws are unchallenged and unchallengeable by any authority outside the Legislature that passed them. Consequently the Maltese Legislature enjoyed all the powers not expressly reserved to the other side of the Dyarchy, and the validity of an Act passed by the Legislature could only be declared void, wholly or pro tanto, by a Court of Law in those cases in which there was encroachment upon the matters reserved to the other side of the Dyarchy, and in this case there was no shadow of encroach-ment. An Act might be inoperative to the extent of its repugnancy, to the provisions of any Act of Parliament extending to the Colony, but, with that exception, no authority existed by which its validity could be questioned or impeached.Some of the critics contended that the Maltese Legislature, as the Legislature of a colony and particularly as the Legislature of a self-governing colony, had absolute sovereignty to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Malta, and once the laws had received the Governors assent and had not been disallowed in accordance with the terms of the Constitution they were final and could not be challenged. The supremacy of the sovereignty of the Legislature in its internal pro-ceedings was even enhanced by the Constitution itself. Section 34 (2) forbade any person of either House whose election had been contested on grounds of corrupt or illegal practices to resign. When it was said that the election was illegal from the very beginning and contrary to the Constitution, it could be answered that under
the terms of Section 34 of the Constitution the Senators were for-bidden to resign. The express and special provisions of Section 34 could not be stayed while judicial proceedings were still pending as to the right to sit and vote. The Standing Bules and Orders also, which under Section 37 (2) of the Constitution had become binding and of force, enjoined upon all members to attend the sittings under penalty of fines or loss of seats. The Constitution Amendment Act had been assented to by the Governor, and in the instructions issued for the guidance of Governors it was noted that &quot; every law that has received the Governors assent comes into operation immediately.&quot; Even if the Act had been disallowed, it would not be null and void from the day on which it had passed.It was argued that the Secretary of State had refused to interfere, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had refused to interfere, but the Court of Appeal had inter-interfered. Though the Court of Appeal might have the right to say that the Senators had not been duly elected, it had not the right to infringe the privileges of the House and to say they had no right to sit and vote pending an election petition, much less to say, months or years afterwards, that laws passed when such Senators were present or through their votes were invalid. The Courts of Law and judicial legislation were subordinate, and even the so-called judicial legislation which existed in England did not exist in Malta. In Malta previous judgments of the Court were quoted only as an authority, and not as law, and might be ignored by an inferior Court or completely set aside in later identical cases by a Court of Appeal differently constituted.It was said that no case has been reported in any Dominion or Colony in which the Imperial or Colonial Courts have pronounced invalid an Act duly assented to on the score that it was passed by a majority in either House which included disqualified persons. Competent writers had always endorsed the statement made by Edward Wilberforce in his &quot; Statute Law &quot; (Stephens and Sons, 1881, p. 24) :-&quot; Nor are the Courts entitled to enquire how an Act of Parliament may have been passed, how far the parties affected by it may have had an opportunity of being heard, how far forms of procedure which are prescribed by Houses of Parlia-ment may have been followed. If an Act of Parliament has been improperly obtained the Legislature alone can provide the remedy; the Courts cannot allow the authority of the Legis-lature to be impeached by a suggestion that an Act of Parlia-ment has been obtained by fraud.&quot;It was also said that no case has been reported where any Court has been asked to rule that votes were wrongly received or dis-allowed.   Any such attempt would be a breach of the privilege
of Parliament. A Court cannot interfere directly with the voting, and much less indirectly by a declaration that a law is invalid because votes were allowed. If unqualified persons wrongly voted, the remedy was provided by the Act of Parliament itself, by imposition of fines, but that power of imposing fines was a specific delegation of duty of action by the supreme authority of Parliament.The Constitution itself by Section 39 had provided that : &quot; It shall be lawful for the Legislature by any law to define the privileges, immunities and powers to be held, en-joyed and exercised by the Senate and Legislative Assembly and by the Members thereof respectively, Provided that no such privileges, immunities or powers shall exceed those for the time being held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons&apos; House of Parliament of Our United Kingdom, or the Members thereof.&quot;In pursuance of the Constitution, the Maltese Legislature had enacted by Act No. XXIV of 1924 that :-&quot; The Senate and the Legislative Assembly and the Mem-bers thereof and the Parliamentary Committees and the Members thereof shall hold, enjoy and exercise the privileges, immunities and powers as are for the time being held, en-joyed and exercised by the Commons&apos; House of Parliament of Great Britain and Members thereof and the Committees and Members thereof, whether such privileges, immunities or powers are so held, possessed or enjoyed by custom, statute or otherwise.&quot;In England by Statute the Bill of Bights passed in William III&apos;s reign enacted that &quot; the freedom of speech and debates or pro-ceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or place out of Parliament,&quot; and by the Letters Patent of 1921 and the Statute of 1924 the same privilege had been given to Malta. The Court of Appeal could not impute to the Legislature less power than appertained to the Council of Govern-ment existing in Malta in days gone by or than that which existed under the Letters Patent of 1903, which expressly precluded the Courts from dealing with the validity of a law because of in-formality in its enactment. The Constitution by its terms estab-lished a Legislature, gave full powers to that Legislature, and expressly gave them the privileges of the House of Commons, so that any express provision was superfluous and derogatory. The Court of Appeal had not been declaring law but had been creating an absolutely new and unheard of jurisdiction for itself and in-vading the sphere of the Legislature, that is, of the King in Parliament.    Further, the Court of Appeal from the first had
proceeded upon a wrong basis. Maltese law has Koman law as its basis, and in accordance with it no case has been recorded in which a Maltese Court has questioned the validity of an Act.The Other Side of the Case.Such are the arguments of the critics. On the other side of the case, it may be briefly said that the Court of Appeal has adhered in the strongest manner to its view of the all-embracing powers of Section 33 of the Constitution and held that the Government has not fulfilled the onus of passing an Act in accordance with the Colonial Laws Validity Act, or the Letters Patent of 1921 or the Letters Patent of 1928, because the Act required by the Letters Patent of 1928 was passed by the votes of two men whose election had been declared to be null and void ; and that, in virtue of Section 33, it need not take into serious account and had duly explained away as irrelevant other clauses of the Constitution or Acts of Parliament, giving the Legislature the rights of the House of Commons and conduct of their own proceedings. The Court had exclusive power, under the authority delegated to it, of ensur-ing the proper observance and application of all laws and was entitled to examine the voting eighteen months after the Act of Legislature had been passed and all the other Acts arid pro-ceedings in the Legislature following from the alleged passing of that Act, and declare them to be null and void.Some of the Defendants&apos; contentions are alluded to and discarded in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, but the mere condensed statement of the opposing viewrs of the political parties and their followers on these legal points may serve to indicate the strong feeling which existed in Malta, the grave uncertainty appertain-ing to the laws of the country, and possibly in some measure a cause of the apprehensions felt by the Church. No good govern-ment of the country could be carried on under such circum-stances, and it is plain that the Imperial Government had before the judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered on the 25th June, come to that conclusion, since, as has been mentioned, on the 26th June, the day following that judgment, the Letters Patent of 1930 and the explanatory Order in Council of the same date were issued, validating the Ordinance of the Governor which had purported to validate the Acts of Parliament that had been passed, including the Electoral Act of 1929.
CHAPTER VI. THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT.Its Termination and the Restoration of the Constitution Recommended.The suspension of the elections by the Governor caused a de-parture from the normal course of Parliamentary Government in Malta. The discussion of relations between Church and State and the legality of the actions of the Government under Lord Strickland shifted to attacks upon the actions of the Governor and to disputes with regard to their legality. These were violently criticized, and, as has already been indicated, the Imperial autho-rities considered that, in view of the conditions that existed in the Island, the knot must be cut to enable the King&apos;s Government to be carried on.The Prime Ministers Announcement.On the 24th June, 1930, the Prime Minister, in answer to questions in the House of Commons by Mr. Macpherson and Mr. Foot, said : -Owing to the urgency of the local situation, His Majesty&apos;s Government have already been compelled to come to a de-cision with regard to the Maltese problem. In the recent Command Paper the House has been given full information regarding the intervention of the Vatican in the temporal affairs of the Island. The position which has been created by this intervention has, in the opinion of the Governor, made it undesirable for the time being to hold the General Election which is now due. In these circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government with considerable reluctance have decided that they have no alternative but to sanction a temporary suspension-sion of the Constitution. The necessary legislation to give effect to this decision will be submitted to His Majesty in Council at an early date. The effect will be to place as an emergency measure the full legislative and executive authority in the hands of the Governor. The existing Ministry will, however, be retained in office and will be available in a con-consultative capacity in so far as the Governor chooses to make use of their services. It is not proposed to publish a further Command Paper relating to Malta at the present, but the text of the Order in Council providing for the interregnum will be made public in the usual manner as soon as possible.&quot;Letters Patent and the explanatory Order in Council were issued on the 26th June to give effect to this decision. The result of these Letters Patent and the Order in Council is that from June, 1930,
the Governor has been practically in the position of an autocrat, taking such, advice as he may think fit, and Ministers have been drawing their salaries and holding office, though having no power.Subsequent to the suspension of the Constitution and after the final communications had passed between the Cardinal Secretary of State and the British representative at the Vatican, matters seem to have remained in a more or less quiet condition in Malta for a time, during the hot months of July, August, and September.The Governor being absent on leave, the government was administered in accordance with the instructions of the Colonial Office and the provisions of the Order in Council by the Lieutenant-Go vernor.Lord Strickland&apos;s Attitude towards the Provisional Government.It would appear that, when Lord Strickland and Sir Augustus Bartolo returned from London in the autumn, Lord Strickland con-sidered that he and his colleagues were entitled to exercise the power of Ministers and not to act solely in a consultative capacity whenever the Governor might think fit. In his evidence before us Lord Strickland developed in detail his criticisms of the Pro-visional Government. He disputed the validity of the Governors actions under Ordinance V of 1930, which provided that during the interregnum all powers vested in Ministers should be exercised by the Lieutenant-Governor, and of the Order in Council as it was being interpreted, on the ground that they were contrary to the Constitution. His contention was that the Order in Council provided that the Executive Council was entitled to continue exactly as it was previous to the suspension of the election, from which the deduction was drawn that the Executive Council should meet regularly and that no Ordinance should be passed except after joint consultation of the Executive and Nominated Councils. It was further stated that appointments and dismissals were not being brought before the Executive Council, though ,Section 64 of the Constitution Letters Patent provided : &quot; The appointment to, and removal from, all public offices under the Maltese Government . . . . save those of Ministers, shall, subject to any law here-after in force in the Island, be vested in the Governor in Council.&quot; It was also argued that pensions could be legally granted only by the Governor in Council. The interpretation put before us was that the Order in Council was an amplification and a description of the powers that were retained under the &quot; Emergency Clauses &quot; of the Constitution in virtue of which the Governor could call the Privy Council together, and, if he did, act without accepting their advice, but, if he would not call them
142together and did not consult the Nominated Council before issuing Ordinances, the method of Government would be high-handed and illegal. The concrete cases cited to us were the appointment of the Secretary of the Traffic Board and the appointment of an English Commissioner of Police to assist the Maltese Commissioner of Police, in opposition to the suggestion of Lord Strickland that the office of Commissioner should be put in commission with a Board composed of the Maltese Commissioner of Police, the new Commissioner of Police, and the Minister for Police (Lord Strickland himself), in order to legalize the position. It was also suggested that the permanent officials were not consulting Ministers and that as little correspondence as possible was being shown to Ministers, and that this was creating an atmosphere in which the dismissal of Ministers was being asked for. The main point of objection to the new system on the part of Ministers appeared to arise from the feeling that they might be dismissed before the next election took place. Their argument was, however, that they had done nothing to forfeit the right to conduct the next election, that if the elections were not conducted by them they would be con-ducted by the permanent officials, who were alleged to be notoriously ultra-clerical, and that Ministers wotild be deprived of their rights. Consequently Lord Strickland contended that Ordinance V should be rescinded at once.Lord Strickland also mentioned that Lord Passfield had in-structed the Governor to avoid controversial matters during the period of the Provisional Government, and he considered that a proposal to start a new hotel was irreconcilable with the authority of the Legislature. In connexion with this proposal a letter was produced to us concerning the dismissal of the Secretary to the Agent-General for Malta in London, which we considered to be irrelevant but agreed to look at with a view to the determination of its relevance. We are aware that papers and letters upon this matter have been published in Malta and consider the question to be quite irrelevant to our inquiry, and we have returned various documents sent to us upon the subject.Lord Strickland also stated that to give to an English company a monopoly to run omnibuses without the formalities established by the Legislature would be contrary to the instructions of Lord Passfield.The Secretary of State for the Colonies did not take Lord Strickland&apos;s view of Ordinance Y, having regard to the provision of the Order in Council which permitted the Governor to act with-out consulting Ministers or, if he did consult them, to act in opposition to their advice; and, although the Secretary of State took no steps for the time being, the opinion was obviously main-tained that the Governor was entitled to consult and take the advice
of any persons whom he might desire to select and that he could dispense with the advice of Ministers whenever he might choose so to do.Ministers accept the Position.In evidence given before us Lord Strickland stated that there was a method by which the Ordinance could have beeu tested, namely, by action in the Courts and appeal to the Privy Council, but that that would have been an aggressive action towards the Administration, which would not have been reconcilable with his position as Head of the Ministry. He stated that Ministers had decided to submit to the interpretation given, subject to the sub-mission of their reasons against it. For practical purposes they had accepted the position and not continued their protest. In consequence they deemed it to be unnecessary to proceed with the objection. We consider that they were well-advised to take this decision.The Views of the Nationalist Party.The Constitutional Party have used many opportunities of making their views familiar in Great Britain. The Nationalist Party have not made such active efforts. Apart from the pamphlet on &quot; The Malta Crisis &quot; (The Rotary Press, Ltd., London, 1930), by Monsignor Dandria, little has been done to bring their views before the public in this country. But it is important that those persons who wish to understand the position in Malta should have some knowledge of the ideas and sentiments of the Nationalists. A mistaken notion of these ideas has done much to bring about the present situation, and to damage British interests in Malta.The Nationalists consider that in granting self-government to the Island the British Government entered into a pact with the Maltese to maintain the Constitution. The suspension of the elections, and later, of the Constitution itself, is regarded by them as an infringe-ment of that pact. In their view the British Government, in an attempt to support one of the local parties against another by the exercise of overriding powers, has thwarted the normal working of the representative institutions which had been granted in 1921. Mr. Amery&apos;s amendment of the Constitution in 192S at the request of one party alone is regarded as being not only unconstitutional in itself, but the source of a series of unconstitutional actions.The suspension of the Constitution in 1930 appears to them as a culminating breach of faith. In their view the ostensible reasons given by the Imperial Government for this step were a pretext for retaining one particular party in office.   From the Nationalist
143standpoint the situation created by the issue of the Pastoral Letter did not justify Imperial intervention. The Constitution was granted to a Catholic country; and it should have been clear that the Constitution could only function in the conditions which, how-ever unintelligible to British opinion, prevail in such countries. If there was any undue intervention by the Church in politics it was a matter for the Maltese people themselves to deal with through their Constitution.The Nationalists consider that the Imperial authorities in the action they took, chose to impose by force majeure upon a small people measures which they would not have imposed upon a larger dependency of the Empire. That action they regard as a marked departure from the British policy by which communities of differing race and religion, to whom self-government has been granted, are allowed freedom to work out their own destiny within the Empire. They contend that their political opjxments who hold themselves out to be supporters of Imperial interests have, by soliciting extra-constitutional intervention, done harm to those interests in Malta ; and the support which has been given to that party is, in their eyes, contrary to the best conceptions of Imperial policy.Appointment of the Royal Commission.No salient development occurred in the situation until the spring of 1931, with the exception of debates in the Imperial Parliament, Lord Strickland inaugurating and taking-part in debates on the subject of Malta in the House of Lords on the 5th November, 1930, and on the 3rd March, 1931. Thereafter, as the position in the Island had become so entangled with the question of whether constitutional government could be re-established, Your Majesty was pleased by Warrant bearing date the 7th April, 1931, to appoint us as Your Majesty&apos;s Com-missioners to inquire into and report upon the political situation in the Island.Restoration of the Constitution Recommended.In the present circumstances the Constitution has been sus-pended for more than a year and a half. The Governor has been acting with or without the advice of Ministers, who have remained in office without responsibility and without power. Popular opinion has had no opportunity of expressing itself through the Legislature, and it is probable that there has been considerable feeling that, in consequence of the actions of a few persons, the Island of Malta as a whole has been punished.We consider that this state of affairs ought not to be continued, and that the Constitution should be restored. It has been granted,
and, whatever the troubles that may have existed, there is no adequate reason why it should not be given a further opportunity of development.The Constitution came into effective operation in November, 1921, and has therefore been in existence for only ten years as regards length of time, and for less if the knowledge of pro-cedure, the preparation of policies, and the settling down of members of the Legislature quite new to the resinonsibilities imposed upon them are to be taken into account. It may be true to say that it has not worked well and that friction has arisen from time to time with the Imperial side of the Dyarchy, and also much friction as between the political parties and with reference to the Church. We consider that very many of the difficulties that have been experienced need never have occurred or could have been accommodated by reasonable methods, more tact, and fewer personal squabbles.Valletta is a small place and rumour spreads very quickly. Politics are discussed in an energetic and often in an acrimonious manner; and this naturally has great effect in a city, where most of the politicians are lawyers accustomed to disputes and all knowr each other&apos;s history and family relationships, on wdiich both politicians and the Press frequently comment in highly satirical terms. The double meanings available in the Maltese language appear to offer considerable opportunity for satire.We have heard the opinion expressed that the Maltese are not able to govern themselves and that the form of government which has been granted to them is unsatisfactory. Our criticism of that would be that many of the Maltese have great ability, that they have had to learn and that, not having had many chances in previous centuries, they seem to have developed a political sense at a rapid rate. They take an interest in endeavouring to develop self-government and a large number of them would prefer to be left to themselves to work out their own amendments to the Con-stitution. We do not feel that there are sufficient grounds to support the opinion that the Maltese people are unable to manage their internal affairs, and we trust that the Imperial Government may be willing to take our view that the Constitution should be restored.Views of Political Parties on Restoration of Constitution.As far as the political parties are concerned, we may cite some of their views regarding the question of the restoration of the Constitution.In the statement of the Constitutional Party it is said : &quot; Ministers urge very strongly that these unfortunate events should in no circumstances serve as a pretext for the with-drawal of responsible government or even for the diminution
of the rights and liberties granted to the Maltese people by the Letters Patent of 1921. The undersigned do not share fears said to be entertained in some quarters that the British Government might be led by past events to contemplate the abolition of the Constitution, but nevertheless they deem it their bounden duty to state most emphatically that reversion to Crown Colony government or the establishment of any other-form of government derogatory to the political status fixed by the Constitution of 1921 would prove disastrous to the welfare and prosperity of Malta, and detrimental to the vital interests of Great Britain and of the Empire, inasmuch as it would engender discontent and provoke chronic and justifiable agitation among a peaceful population living in a fortified Island which is the keystone of the British Empire &quot;.In the statement of the Nationalist Party there is quoted a reso-lution passed unanimously by the Congress of that party at two meetings, held on the 12th and the 19th April, 1931, urging that the Constitution be restored to its completeness and claiming the full recognition of the exclusive right of the Maltese people to amend and better it by means of their legitimate Parliamentary representatives.The memorandum of the Labour Party contains these remarks : &quot; It is finally desired to make it clearly understood that the Labour Party will, in any case, welcome the earliest return of self-government with or without the amendments suggested (by them). It is realized that, notwithstanding the defects which, in the opinion of the Party, exist in the Constitution, the grant of self-government to these Islands has been a source of education to the masses, who, undoubtedly, are learning to think for themselves and forming a wholesome political con-science. ... If any form of Crown Colony government or any other form of administration falling short of the autonomy recently enjoyed is established in Malta, the Labour Party declares that it will maintain its political organization in order-to combat, by every kind of systematic opposition and agitation, any such government as long as it remains in existence &apos;&apos;.The final resolution of the Labour Party stated : &quot; That the Maltese people, adamant in the determination of making Malta a nation, will in no circumstances tolerate, in this century of progress, Crown Colony government, which is against every democratic principle and which savours of class interest &quot;.
A large number of resolutions in favour of the restoration of the Constitution were forwarded to us by various Associations and Clubs and supported by the evidence of witnesses.Views of the Commission.We consider that the Constitution has not yet had a sufficient or even a fair trial. Whatever errors may have been committed by a few, there is no reason, in our opinion, why the many should be subjected to the loss of that self-government which has been granted to them at so recent a date, and in effect should be disfranchised for acts which they have not committed. We may deprecate, but we are not prepared to give an undue weight to, some of the strong language, used particularly in sections of the Press, the personal innuendoes, suspicions and attacks. Such pro-ceedings are not unknown in countries where constitutional government has been established for a long time, while in Malta self-government is but young, and, as several witnesses indicated, the people of Malta are learning to stand on their feet. With the quickness, good nature, and ability which characterize so many of them, and the generally reasonable and sensible character of the Maltese people, there can be no just reason for considering that they will not be able to manage their own affairs much better when they have had greater experience in self-govem-ment. If they should not prove to be able to manage so small an Island, there can be little doubt that a very different system of Government would have to be considered by the Imperial autho-rities, involving drastic changes.We see no reason to fear that our judgment may prove to be wrong in advising the restoration of the Constitution. We suggest, it is true, certain minor amendments, but these are of little moment compared with that broad and basic point.CHAPTER VII. PROPOSALS BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES FOR AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION.Suggestions of the Constitutional and Labour Parties considered.On the assumption that the Letters Patent of 1921 would be cancelled and that new Letters Patent would be issued in their place, the Constitutional Party and also the Labour Party, under Dr. Boffa, proposed certain amendments, but not of the same character. Those of the Constitutional Party consisted of definite amendments to certain Sections of the Letters Patent of 1921, and
those of the Labour Party were concerned with such wide ques-tions as the abolition of the Senate, the substitution of Maltese for the Italian language as an official language, manhood suffrage, the abolition of plural votes, and various other questions, to which in course of time we think the Labour Party would gradually have devoted its attention as circumstances might arise. The present circumstances do not, in our opinion, warrant such wide changes in Malta.As so many of the present disputes have arisen from the deci-sions of the Courts, it might have been expected that the Con-stitutional Party would bring forward the question of the reform of the Courts, particularly on the subject of the electoral law. They have done so on three main points : (1) The trial of election petitions; (2) the language of the Courts; and (3) the alleged partisan character of the Judges. All these are subjects closely interwoven with each other.Proposed Alteration with regard to Election Petitions.With regard to the electoral law, the principal provision on which the Court of Appeal has continuously based its power over the pro-ceedings of the Legislature is Section 33 of the Constitution Letters Patent, which states :  &quot; All questions which may arise as to the right of any person to be or remain a Member of the Senate or Legisla-tive Assembly shall be referred to and decided by Our Court of Appeal in Malta.&quot;It was at first proposed by Lord Strickland that an amendment to Section 33 should be inserted, but the suggested amendment to that Section was so unsatisfactory that, after criticism, he replaced it with a proposed addition to Section 56. Section 56 runs as follows : &quot; (1) All persons in Malta shall have full liberty of con-science and the free exercise of their respective modes of religious worship.&quot; (2) No person shall be subjected to any disability or excluded from holding any office by reason of his religious profession.&quot;The proposed addition is as follows : &quot; (3) No person shall be subjected to any disability or excluded from any rights connected with candidature for Par-liament or election thereto by reason of his religious profession or of any departure therefrom.

All these are subjects closely interwoven with each other.Proposed Alteration with regard to Election Petitions.With regard to the electoral law, the principal provision on which the Court of Appeal has continuously based its power over the pro-ceedings of the Legislature is Section 33 of the Constitution Letters Patent, which states :  &quot; All questions which may arise as to the right of any person to be or remain a Member of the Senate or Legisla-tive Assembly shall be referred to and decided by Our Court of Appeal in Malta.&quot;It was at first proposed by Lord Strickland that an amendment to Section 33 should be inserted, but the suggested amendment to that Section was so unsatisfactory that, after criticism, he replaced it with a proposed addition to Section 56. Section 56 runs as follows : &quot; (1) All persons in Malta shall have full liberty of con-science and the free exercise of their respective modes of religious worship.&quot; (2) No person shall be subjected to any disability or excluded from holding any office by reason of his religious profession.&apos;&apos;The proposed addition is as follows : &quot; (3) No person shall be subjected to any disability or excluded from any rights connected with candidature for Par-liament or election thereto by reason of his religious profession or of any departure therefrom.
&quot; All questions that may arise as to the right of any person to be or to remain a Member of the Senate or the Legislative Assembly that are alleged to be affected by this Clause shall be referred to, and decided by, a Judge of His Majesty&apos;s Superior Courts in Malta selected by the Governor, who shall also appoint as Assessors having equal jurisdiction two members of the English Bar; and election petitions and all matters under this Section shall be heard and decided as provided by the law in England for similar cases.&quot; Whenever it is decided that undue influence has been exercised to the extent which would, under the law of England, entitle the person aggrieved to claim the seat and to have it adjudged to him, it shall be decided that the candidate preju-diced by undue influence shall be declared elected.&quot; As between several candidates who shall have brought an action in Court demanding the unseating of a member on the grounds contemplated in this Sub-section and claiming the seat for themselves, the Court shall decide that, among those candidates, the one who has received the largest measure of support from the electors, as indicated in the official and final result of the election in that district as certified by the Elec-tion Commissioners and published in the Government Gazette, shall be declared elected.&quot; Whenever any question is raised under this Clause all proceedings that may have been raised under Section 33 in reference to the same or to a parallel claim shall be suspended, and Section 33 shall not apply.&quot;Sir Augustus Bartolo stated that he was not personally in favour of adding the proposed Sub-section to Section 56. It would only tend to create a rather bitter atmosphere and from a legal point of view would be redundant and unnecessary. He gave various reasons for his opinion, a principal reason being that clerical undue influence, if alleged, should be examined before the same tribunal as any other undue influences.Proposal not acceptable.We are unable ourselves to assent to this proposed Sub-section. In addition to the importance of having election petitions settled with speed, it would be, in our opinion, an impracticable matter to bring assessors from England on the occasion of any contested election. They would be entirely ignorant of the language in which most of the evidence would necessarily be given; they would be considered to have been sent for the purpose of overruling the
Maltese Judge, and it would be considered a direct interference by the Imperial Government with Maltese privileges. At present it would appear that a Judge has not only to be of Maltese origin but also educated at the University of Malta.It is difficult to say whether the use of the words &quot; as provided by the law in England &quot; would be taken to import the whole of the English electoral law, including alleged undue influence by the Roman Catholic Church. We do not think that these laws could be imported in this abrupt manner.As regards other proceedings under the electoral law, the proviso to Section 34 of the Constitution Letters Patent of 1921 mentions proceedings for &quot; any corrupt or illegal practices &quot; at an election. Although the word &quot; illegal &quot; in this respect is nowhere defined in Maltese law and has to be interpreted for each case, the words would appear to be sufficient to cover the ordinary cases of corrup-tion, with such explanation or definition as the Legislature may consider to be advisable and desire to enact.Other suggested alterations in law relating to Elections.Other suggestions were put before us relating to matters of election law which, in our opinion, could best be settled by the Legislature of Malta rather than imposed from outside. Such proposed amendments include the question of the length of leave which could be given to absentees without vacation of their seats, the quorum required to be present in the Senate (Section 10 of the Constitution) and in the Legislative Assembly (Section 17) before the despatch of business can be proceeded with, and the qualifica-tion of voters for the election of the General Members of the Senate. Such minor matters as the length of leave and quorum are obviously matters of local interest and convenience, but on the qualification of voters for the election of General Members it was suggested that, instead of the words : &apos;&apos; Any person .... who is a male British subject of the age of 21 years and upwards who is able to read and write and who is, in his own right or in right of his wife &quot; possessed of certain property, there should be the amended words : &quot; Any person .... who is a male British-born subject of British-born parents of the age of 21 years and upwards who is able to read and write or who is, in his own right or in right of his wife &quot; possessed of certain property, etc. A similar amendment was proposed as an amendment to Section 14 on the qualification of voters for the Legislative Assembly.We do not agree with these proposed amendments. The first amendment would exclude anyone either of whose parents belonged
or had belonged to another nationality. For instance, no son of a wife whether of French, Spanish, Italian, or other foreign origin could become entitled to vote in Malta, though she had become a British subject by right of marriage. The second amendment would involve a wide alteration in the tei-ms on which the franchise is exercised, which in our opinion should be settled by Malta itself.Suggested extension of franchise to members of Imperial Forces.Another suggestion was that the vote should be extended to persons on full pay in the Imperial Naval, Military, and Air Forces if they possessed in their own right or in right of their wife property in Malta of the annual value of .- 20 a year for the Senate, or  5 for the Legislative Assembly&apos;, or had an interest in a tenancy of the same value for one year before the registration, in addition to the present qualification of possessing a legal domicile in Malta. Domicile is a rule of English electoral law and in Malta it has been generously interpreted to mean residence.Objections to this Proposal.We see no reason to add to the number of voters by this extension of the franchise. There is no evidence that it has been asked for or is wanted.The interests of members of the Imperial Forces and their families have a safeguard in the presence of members of the Services on the Nominated Council, and in the powers of the Imperial side of the Dyarchy. It might with reason be said that to give them a voice in the election of the Maltese Legislature would confer an advantage on persons who, in many cases, are only resident for a short time in the Island or who draw some return from a small investment in the Island or rent a house for a limited period. The inclusion of members of the Imperial Services within the arena of local politics would possibly not conduce to good relations between them and the Maltese. We consider that it would be wiser to exclude them from this particular arena, although in many other respects closer relations between permanent and temporary inhabitants may be desirable.Proposed Alterations in law relating to Disqualification.Another proposal made was that there should be an alteration in the disqualification of persons entitled to be registered as voters or to vote at any election for members of the Senate or the Legislative Assembly.   Under Section 30 of the Constitution disqualification
attaches to a voter for life in the case of persons sentenced in the manner mentioned in the Section. It was proposed by the Labour Party that the disqualification should last for eight years as a maximum, the actual period of disqualification being left to the discretion of the Court, and that in the case of sentences with hard labour the disqualification should exist for five years, and in cases of simple imprisonment for two years. We agree that the present disqualification is harsh, but we think an alteration might easily be suggested by the Legislature of Malta if greater liberty is desired. If, however, an Imperial Act of Parliament is passed, we consider that disqualification should be amended in the manner proposed.Another disqualification is contained in Section 30 (3) of the Constitution Letters Patent, which provides for the disqualification of a person &quot; if he is of unsound mind or has within three years before the election received charitable relief in Malta from any public source.&quot; &quot; Charitable relief from any public source &quot; is a very wide term and is not defined, but in this case the Legislature of Malta may be able to make a suggestion.In addition to the disqualifications existing in Section 30, the proposal was made that a Sub-section should be added to provide that disqualification should be incurred&quot; (4) Pf consequent upon any obligation which he has assumed or which devolves, or may devolve, upon him by reason of his profession or status he is bound to obey superior orders or is otherwise not free in the exercise of the franchise.&quot;This proposal is wide in its wording and would appear to dis-franchise Civil Servants, but it is plainly directed against the monastic orders and possibly against the priests in general. We see no adequate reason for introducing this new restriction and we think it was brought up in view of the circumstances of the present disputes.The same may be said to apply to the suggestion that no dis-qualification as a member of either House should apply to the case of a shareholder of a company duly constituted by law, of which the shares have been open to public subscription, having contracts with the Government, unless the shareholder possesses more than one-quarter of the capital of the company. This proposal would appear to affect at the most only a few contractors.Another proposal aimed at disfranchising British subjects who act in Malta as Consuls for foreign Powers. We do not recom-mend this change and in any event it is a matter of foreign affairs reserved to the Imperial Government. The same amendment included a proposal to disfranchise persons who had acquired British1245Sg
nationality and were domiciled in Malta but might belong, by birth, to nations which did not recognize their right to change their nationality. This is a matter which should rest with the Legis-lature of Malta.Question of Female Suffrage.The question of votes for women was referred to but did not appear to have support from any political party. There was, however, a suggestion that among the proposed nominated members of the Senate, in the event of alterations being made in the constitution of that body, there should be nominated two women with property qualifications in the Island. A petition, signed by women, asking for the recognition of votes for women, was sent to us, but the suggestion was not pressed and we had no other evidence that the extension would be acceptable. It has nothing to do with the present situation in the Island. We are not aware of any Dominion or Colony in which women have been first and specially brought into a Legislature by introduction into an Upper House. In view of the conditions prevailing in Malta we are unable at the present time to propose that women should be admitted to the franchise. If any desire is evinced in that direction, the movement should come from Malta itself and an alteration should not be imposed from outside.Proportional Representation.Under the present Constitution elections are carried on under proportional representation. This system might appear to be too complicated for the use of illiterate persons, but we were informed that political education has made such progress in Malta that the system is fully understood by the voters and is much appreciated by them.On this point Lord Strickland stated in evidence before us : &quot; I find proportional representation excellent in Malta. The people understand it. The argument against it, that it is complicated and causes papers to be spoiled, has been dis-proved in Malta, notwithstanding the inadequate standard of education. A country like Malta, with diversity of interest, of religion, and of language, could hardly attempt to have responsible government without proportional representation, because without it some one party would gain the monopoly or the ascendancy, and pass legislation which would enable it to keep it for ever .... Under proportional repre-sentation there have always been plenty of candidates, about
1two or three times the number of vacancies to be filled .... Without proportional representation the party system here would mean that there would be no minority representation whatever . . . . It is the only system possible. In a country where there are different religions and interests you must have criticism .... It is only by criticism, and by having an alternative to the Government for the time being available, that party government or constitutional government is workable in this country.&quot;Mr. Robert Hamilton, a leading member of the Constitutional Party, endorsed this view, stating : &quot; Proportional representation has all the qualities which have been set forth before you by Lord Strickland already, but I beg to add this. Proportional representation has found favour with the people, and it is surprising in a country like Malta, where there are a great number of illiterates, that the number of invalid votes in the three elections has been so few . . . . It is now, moreover, a system that has worked for three elections, and the people are used to it and like it, and it is a thing which should not on any account be done away with in Malta. In Malta there are people who are rabid supporters of one Party and there are people who are rabid supporters of another Party, but you will find that there are very few who vote for one candidate only; they vote for three, four, five or six and in some cases for the whole list of candidates.&quot;Dr. Paul Boffa, the Leader of the Labour Party, remarked : &quot; Everyone holds that proportional representation gives a chance to every Party to be represented in Parliament. We wrant the liberty of the Press and proportional representation to be reserved subjects in the Constitution. We are asking for safeguards so that we may not be gagged either in the Press or by not having representatives in future Legislatures.&quot;Sir Ugo Mifsud desired that there should be no change in the Constitution in this respect.In the event of manhood suffrage being conferred, or in the event of &quot; One man, one vote &quot; being the qualification, it might be difficult for any Opposition of an adequate character to be elected, but, in view of the general acceptance of the present system by at least two of the parties and the desire that the electoral system should not be altered by outside authority but by the people themselves, we do not suggest any alteration. It would not appear that the programmes of the political parties contain an
alteration of this system as one of their principal objects, and we think that the present system should be continued. In our opinion an alteration to manhood suffrage would require an Act of the Imperial Parliament, though weighty legal opinion was given to us that the Legislature of Malta might now be able to abolish it by a bare majority at a joint sitting. The Constitution Letters Patent of 1921 only enacted that there was to be proportional representation for the first Legislature. There have been two opportunities to make an alteration, with different parties in power, subsequent to the first Legislature, and a change has not even been proposed.Another minor suggestion related to the disqualification of per-sons from registration and was that no person should be qualified to be registered as a voter in relation to ownership of property or receipt of rent unless a signed declaration had been transmitted to the Electoral Registrar specifying the title and describing the property in regard to which the claim was based.We think that this is a matter for the Maltese themselves and that in any event any such rule would be extremely cumbersome and difficult to carry out. The Registrars would not be the type of persons who could decide on the value of declarations of title or descriptions of property, and the majority of voters probably could not fill up any such declaration without the employment of legal assistance. There were minor matters connected with the conduct of elections and the registration of voters, all of which referred to the Electoral Act of 1929 and Regulations made by Proclamation published by the Governor thereunder. As we propose to advise that the Act of 1929, in view of doubts which have been cast upon its validity, should be repealed, we do not consider it necessary to deal in detail with these proposed alterations.Plural Voting.A more important amendment was that proposed by the Labour Party for the abolition of plural voting. It was explained that a man could go to one polling booth and give a vote for all the districts where he had property, a red paper being given to him for one district, a green paper for another and a white paper for another, and so on. Eor 1930, the Electoral Registrar issued a paper showing that in the first district of Valletta there were 385 plural votes out of a total number of 3,800 votes, in the second district 494 out of a total of 6,000, and in the third district 568 out of a total of 8,000.In his evidence before us Dr. Paul Boffa said : &quot; Here in Malta, according to the Constitution of 1921, a man can have as many votes as there are districts in Malta.
He can have 8 for the Legislative Assembly and 2 for the Senate if he has got property in each and every district, besides other votes arising from his special qualifications. If he is a doctor he can vote for the professionals; if he is a noble he has another vote as a noble; if he is a member of the Chamber of Commerce he has another vote there. A man can have 14 votes in Malta, whereas another man, whose only fault is that he is poor and ignorant, is debarred from having a vote. We consider this to be a grave injustice, and the Labour Party is of opinion that the Commissioners should take steps to remedy this anomaly of one man having 14 votes and another man not having one at all.&quot; (Q.) Are there many people in Malta with 14 votes?  There are many with 4, 5, 6 or 7.(Q.) There is a good deal of difference between 14 and 4? Yes, but there is a greater difference between one man having 6 votes and another man having none.&quot;We are of opinion that any change of this character would best be left to the discretion of the Maltese Legislature and we are not prepared to make any recommendations on the subject. It is not a matter which could be dealt with by prerogative legislation, and if the change were imposed by the British Government an Act of the Imperial Parliament would be required. The question is purely one of the franchise, and we feel that the development or modification of the Constitution on such points should be left to be worked out in Malta, and that the Maltese Legislature is the best place for the consideration in detail of the arguments for and against the abolition of plural voting or the reduction of the number of votes which can be exercised by a single individual in the election of members of the Legislature.Questions between the two sides of the Dyarchy.It may be desirable to mention that a proposal was made by Lord Strickland with reference to the spheres of the two sides of the Dyarchy. He suggested that there should be added to Section 41 the following Sub-section (7) :  &quot; All questions that may arise between the Executive Council and the Maltese Imperial Government under Sections 41 and 43 and any other Section touching directly or indirectly their respective spheres of jurisdiction shall be referred by the Governor to the Secretary of State for the Dominions, who shall thereupon refer the said matter to the Authority entrusted to deal with the relations between the Imperial and Dominion Governments.&apos;&apos;
It may be pointed out that the body to which Lord Strickland appears to refer is, at least at present, a hypothetical body sug-gested at one of the Imperial Conferences and has not come into being, and it appears to us that, if it came into being, it would hardly be a body to which the comparatively small question of the working of the Dyarchy in Malta could appropriately be referred.Establishments of Lieutenant-Governor and Legal Adviser,Another proposal was that the Establishments of the Lieutenant-Governor and the Legal Adviser should be taken out of the Reserved Civil List and be voted annually by the Legislature. We are entirely opposed to this suggestion, which would enable the permanent officials specially attached to the Governor to be made the subject of debate and criticism in the Legislature. This would be most undesirable in a Colony with the dyarchical system of government which has been established in Malta, and an infringe-ment of the authority and position of the executive personnel of one side of the Dyarchy by the other side of the Dyarchy.The Secretary to the Maltese Imperial Government.Lord Strickland also put forward the proposition that provision for the salary attaching to the offices of Secretary to the Maltese Imperial Government and of Private Secretary to the Governor should be subject to the vote of the Malta Legislature, and also that the two offices should not be amalgamated in one person. We are unable to assent to the first suggestion. We consider it to be an obvious matter of principle that the salaries of officers who serve the Imperial side of the Dyarchy should not be subject to the control of the Malta Legislature. It is evident that such officers, if they are to discharge their duties efficiently, must often have to put forward views or to take action which will be unpalatable to the Ministry in power. It is essential, therefore, that their independence should be secured and that the advice which they tender to the Governor should be disinterested. In these circumstances, to make their salaries subject to the vote of the Legislature and consequently to expose them to its annual discussion and criticism is a course to be deprecated.The Provision for the Salary of the Private Secretary.As to the second suggestion, the question whether the offices of Secretary to the Maltese Imperial Government and of Private Secretary to the Governor should be combined in the same person
is one on which we do not feel inclined to make any general recommendation. It is a matter of administrative convenience which can, no doubt, be dealt with by the Governor as circum-stances dictate, but we do feel that there is force in the criticism of the existing provision in the reserved Civil List whereby the two offices are combined together as one service.These two posts are in different categories. The Secretary to the Maltese Imperial Government is a high administrative officer on the Imperial side of the Dyarchy, and his office, as we understand the position, is subject to the same control by the Secretary of State as would be that of an officer of similar standing in a Crown Colony. A Private Secretary is the personal officer of the Governor, and, in accordance with normal practice, is appointed by the Governor personally. We are, therefore, of the opinion that, when an opportunity offers, the Civil List should be revised in such a manner as to recognize this distinction.The Question of a Civilian Governor.From time to time proposals have been made that it would be desirable that the office of Governor should be filled by a civilian instead of by a military officer of high rank. The question seems to have been raised first in the &apos;forties of the last century, when Her Majesty Queen Victoria sent a very gracious message that Her Majesty would be pleased to concur in the proposal made by the people of Malta for the appointment of a civilian as Governor. An Irishman, Richard Moore 0&apos;Ferrall, a Roman Catholic, was appointed to be Governor, but the experiment does not seem to have given better results. The idea for a long time has been that Malta, being an important fortress, should have as Governor a military officer accustomed to command men and able to act in the event of any sudden outbreak of war or any possible attack upon the Island. A military Governor has been generally chosen from the Royal Artillery or the Royal Engineers, and was probably selected in preference to a naval officer owing to the position of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. The Governors have been generally men of very distinguished military position, and most of them have been men who have performed the duties of their office with tact and ability.Lord Strickland proposed that a young man of Parliamentary standing with aspirations to ministerial office was the type of man who should be selected as a civilian Governor, a suggestion in which we do not concur.It is, however, to be considered whether, in view of the reduc-tion of the military garrison and the existence of a Constitution
necessitating much political knowledge in the working of Parlia-ments and dealing with Ministers, in addition to a knowledge of the proper legal procedure which has to be so carefully followed, there should not be some trial of a trained civilian in place of a military Governor, when a vacancy occurs. It may perhaps be hardly within our province to tender any advice upon this subject, but we may mention that it has been brought forward and a change advocated. Lord Milner in 1919 appears to have deferred considera-tion of the matter. One advantage of the change would probably be that some of the present posts might be abolished and economies effected in a country where the cost of establishments is already very large.No General Need for Revision of Constitution from outside.In giving these opinions upon the suggestions that have been made for a review of the Constitution, we wish it to be borne in mind that they were composed upon the assumption that the Letters Patent of 1921 would be cancelled and that new Letters Patent would be issued in their place. Having heard the very lengthy arguments on both sides upon this question, we have come to the conclusion that there is not sufficient need to suggest that the Constitution should be revised at the present time in the pro-posed manner by outside interference, although we suggest in a later paragraph that some amendments to the Constitution should be made, if an Act of the Imperial Parliament should be contem-plated. Many of the suggestions to which we have alluded were plainty drafted with the object of adding to the power of one political party.Power of the Court of Appeal.Of the foregoing subjects one of the most important is that rela-ting to the power of the Court of Appeal with regard to electoral matters. The broad question is whether Section 33 of the Gon-stitution Letters Patent ought to be amended, and, if so, in what manner. We are not a superior Court of Appeal to revise the judicial decisions of Your Majesty&apos;s Court of Appeal in Malta, or to state in what principles or details the Court of Appeal may or may not have been wrong. We are opposed to the introduction of an English judge, and we are aware that the Bar of Malta includes lawyers of great ability. We are unable to find or suggest any satisfactory authority to whom an appeal in electoral matters can be made from the decisions of the Court of Appeal. Appeals to the Privy Council upon electoral matters have not received any encouragement in the advice given by the Judicial Committee in cases that have been brought before them.Imputations have, however, been made against the Court of Appeal to which the Chief Justice objected as to its partisan
151character. It has been said that the Judges are too one-sided, both from the nature of the appointments that have been made and in their political opinions. We are not prepared to discuss this charge of bias, but, assuming that Section 83 remains as it is and that the Court of Appeal has the power that it has claimed and exercised of declaring laws to be invalid on the ground that they have been passed by the Legislature owing to the votes of Members whose right to sit had been declared to be invalid by the Court of Appeal, there remains the question whether there should be any check on this power, in order to prevent its exercise after an undue lapse of time.Suggested Time Limit.The invalidity of the laws passed in 1929 was only declared many months in fact, much more than a year after they had been in force in the Island and after executive acts had been per-formed under them. With the narrow majorities which may occur in so small a Legislature as that of Malta, in one or the other House or at a joint sitting, circumstances might again arise whereby uncertainty would continue for a long time as to whether certain Acts of the Legislature were valid or not, and they might be declared invalid when the life of the Island had proceeded in a manner which almost required continuity of validity. If an Act of the Imperial Parliament is passed authorizing amendments in the Constitution, we would suggest that it might be advisable to lay down a strict limitation of time, such as a period of twelve months, after which the validity of laws could not be called in question and their validity or invalidity declared. Such an enact-ment would give some control over the exercise of powers which might seriously affect the continuity of administration in the Island.The suggestion made by the Constitutional Party was an exten-sion of the Constitution under the Parliamentary Privileges Act, 1924, by which the Legislature defined its privileges. The proposal made was that in the Constitution, after Section 39 (1), an inser-tion should be made by Act of the Imperial Parliament.Section 39 (1) says : &quot; It shall be lawful for the Legislature by any law to define the privileges, immunities and powers to be held, en-joyed and exercised by the Senate and Legislative Assembly and the Members thereof respectively :&quot; Provided that no such privileges, immunities or powers shall exceed those for the time being held, enjoyed and exer-cised by the Commons&apos; House of Parliament of Our United Kingdom, or the Members thereof.&quot;
It was proposed that there should be added to this Section the following words : &quot; And provided any judgment of Our Courts in Malta shall be null and void in as far as it may purport to affect the pro-cedure and privileges of the Senate or the Legislative Assembly or any law to which Assent has been given in Our Name which has not been disallowed within the period of one year or which is not irreconcilable with an Act of the Imperial Parliament expressly declared to be applicable to Malta or with the provisions as to Reserved Matters in these Out-Letters Patent.&quot;We consider, however, that the suggestion which we have outlined above, if put into suitable legal language, would meet the case.The Constitution of the Trade Union Council.Another important proposal was made by Mr. Bencini on behalf of the Labour Party and was supported by Mr. Robert Hamilton. At present Sub-section (4) of Section 7 of the Letters Patent of 1921 reads as follows : &quot; The term &apos; Trade Union Council &apos; wherever it is used in this Section and in the last preceding two Sections, means a Council or other body recognized by the Governor as repre-senting the Trade Unions of Malta for the purposes of these Our Letters Patent.&quot;The proposal made by Mr. Bencini was that the Sub-section should read as follows : &quot; The term &apos; Trade Union Council &apos; for the purposes of these Our Letters Patent, means an autonomous body of Trade Union members, representative of and elected by Trade Unions duly registered in virtue of the Malta Trade Union Act (Ordinance No. of 193   ).   Provided that no memberof the clergy, of the nobility, of the graduates or members of the Chamber of Commerce shall be members of the Malta Trade Union Council.&quot;Mr. Bencini stated that he strongly believed that, as long as the constitution of the Trade Union Council and the official recognition rested in the hands of the Governor, disputes would arise again. He contended that it was unjust and unfair that the Trade Union Council should not enjoy the stability and independ-ence in its constitution enjoyed by the other special bodies repre-sented in the Senate, the Letters Patent providing that in the Senate there shall be &quot; two Members representative of and elected by the Trade Union Council.&quot;
152A Change Desirable.We have given very careful consideration to this subject, which is difficult not so much in the result to be aimed at but as to the manner in which the result could be obtained. We think it is very desirable that a change should be made. No subject has given rise to so much litigation, so many differences of opinion and so much trouble as this subject of the constitution of the Trade Union Council. We agree with the opinion that it is not likely to be free from difficulties in the future unless some more secure basis can be provided, a basis which will not be in a perpetual state of flux and permit the Ministers of the day to change the constitution of the Trade Union Council according to their political views.The History of the Council.The history of the Trade Union Council is curious. When the Constitution Letters Patent were promulgated there was no Trade Union Council in existence, but, as a matter of fact, it would almost appear to have been assumed, when the Letters Patent were drafted, that there was already some sort of Trade Union Council established in Malta. It is hardly to be supposed that the framers of the Constitution would deliberately provide for the representation of a body which they knew to be non-existent without including some words relating to its future establishment.A mere hypothesis as to the cause of the difficulty is, however, of no value. In fact, when it was realized that there was no Trade Union Council in existence, the Governor was authorized to include in his Proclamation of the loth September, 1921, issued under Section 67 of the Letters Patent, a provision enabling him to recognize a Council or other body as representing the Trade Unions of Malta for the purposes of the Letters Patent. The actual pro-vision of the Proclamation was that Sub-section (4), as recited above, should be added to Section 7 of the Letters Patent. It would seem that this provision was intended as a temporary expedient to meet the situation until the Malta Legislature itself filled the gap by amending the Constitution according to the pro-cedure provided in that instrument.For the purposes of the election of the first Legislature the Governor, under the powers conferred by the new Sub-section, issued notices formally recognizing ten bodies as being Trade Unions for the purposes of the Letters Patent. These bodies were then directed to elect delegates in the proportion of one for every
hundred of their members. The persons so elected were recognized as being the Trade Union Council, and they proceeded to elect two members of the Senate. It should be observed that, as at this time there were no Ministers in existence, the Governor took this step on his own initiative.The Trade Union Council Bill.It was not long before doubts began to be expressed as to the bona fide nature of some of the bodies which had been recognized as Trade Unions for the purposes of the Letters Patent. On the 22nd February, 1923, the Legislative Assembly appointed a Corn-mission to inquire into the composition, election, and constitution of the Trade Union Council. It seems clear from the evidence put before that Commission that some of the so-called Trade Unions were of a bogus character, having been formed merely for the purpose of the election and ceasing to exist immediately after-wards. The two Trade Union Senators took the opportunity of resigning their seats and obtaining election to the Legislative Assembly, possibly thinking that doubts might exist as to the validity of their election to the Senate. These two seats in the Senate remained vacant for some fifteen months while the Malta Government was considering what provision should be made for holding further elections for the Trade Union Members of the Senate. Finally, a Law, entitled &quot; An Act for Constituting a Trade Union Council,&quot; was passed by a bare majority in each House of the Legislature and was reserved by the Governor for the signification of Your Majesty&apos;s pleasure.The question was immediately raised as to whether the measure introduced an amendment into the Constitution, Section 41 (6) of the Letters Patent providing that a law for the alteration of the Constitution should not be valid unless affirmed by not less than two-thirds of the total number of the members of each House of the Legislature.The definition Clause, No. 2, of the proposed Law read as follows :  &quot; In this Act, the expression &apos; association &apos; or &apos; workmen&apos;s union &apos; means a body of persons not less than fifty the majority of whom are artisans and other manual workers, duly consti-tuted under a statute of its own, and having for its object the moral and economical improvement of workers in general or of a specific branch of workers in particular, or having a purpose of social providence to the social funds of which the members contribute not less than six shillings per annum. Associations or unions not possessing an autonomous adminis-tration and which are completely dependent on a non-Maltese
association or union shall not be included in those definitions nor shall be included secret associations and all other associa-tions having an anti-religious or anti-social object.&quot;The Labour Party took strong exception to this definition, on the ground that it would exclude the Seamen and Firemen &apos;s Union and the Workers&apos; Union, which were affiliated to large outside associations or unions, and that it included Benefit Societies estab-lished for mutual benefit, which the Labour Party were not pre-pared to accept as legitimate Trade Unions and some of which had proved to be the bogus Trade Unions on which the Commis-sion had received evidence.The Secretary of State referred the question of the validity of the Law to the Law Officers of the Crown, who gave their opinion that the provisions of the proposed Act would effect an alteration in the Letters Patent&apos; and were therefore invalid unless passed by a two-thirds majority of each House. The Secretary of State thereupon decided that it would not be possible for him to lay the proposed Law before Your Majesty in Council with a view to obtaining Your Majesty&apos;s Assent. It&apos;might have been possible to give effect to the provisions in the proposed Law by the exercise of the Governor&apos;s powers conferred on him by the Proclamation of the 15th September, 1921, but the Secretary of State considered that-&quot; in exercising his power to constitute a. Trade Union Council under the terms of the Proclamation, the Governor would have to act on the advice of his Ministers from time to time in deciding which Unions should be recognized. The result of this would no doubt be to throw the qualifications for member-ship of the Trade Union Council into a constant state of flux  a position which appears to be very undesirable.&quot;This anticipation of the Secretary of State has undeniably proved to be correct.Attempt to establish a stable Council.Sir Walter Congreve in 1926 made an attempt to overcome the difficulty in a manner which has considerable merit. His idea was to establish a stable Council on non-party lines, and he proposed to proceed in the manner adopted by Lord Plumer in 1921, namely, to invite bodies to come forward and claim recognition as Trade Unions. He would then decide which bodies were fit to be recognised -nised as Trade Unions and ask Ministers formally to advise him to recognize them and to recognize their representatives as a body representing the Trade Unions of Malta for the purposes of the
Letters Patent. If Ministers were not prepared to advise him in this sense, then he was prepare -ed to act without their advice, or, in other words, like Lord Plumer in 1921, to constitute a Council on his own initiative.It appears that Ministers found themselves unable to concur in this proposal. They held it to be unconstitutional for the Governor to act otherwise than on the /advice of Ministers. By Clause 11 of the Boyal Instructions to the Governor, the Governor may act in opposition to the advice of the Executive Council if he sees sufficient cause. The question arose, therefore, as to whether the Governor could, in virtue of this Clause, carry through his proposal against the advice of Ministers.The Secretary of State seems to have held that Clause 11 of the Boyal Instructions was quite general in its terms and prima facia applicable to any matter, however important, but that prima facie under responsible government the Governor should exercise his power under Section 7 (4) of the Constitution on the advice of Ministers. The question then arose whether, in view of the subject-matter and all the attendant circumstances, it would be proper as a matter of constitutional practice and advisable as a matter of practical politics for the Governor to establish a Trade Union Council otherwise than on the advice of Ministers. Under the Constitution, the actual composition or constitution of the Trade Union Council was a matter within the competence of the Malta Legislature, provided they could pass an Act with the required majority, and it was clear that any such legislation would have to be introduced by or with the support of Ministers. This fact appeared to lend support to the contention that the Trade Union Council, if established by the Governor under Section 7 (4) of the Letters Patent, should be so established only on the advice of Ministers. It might be repugnant to sound constitutional prac-tice if the Governor performed any positive executive act with regard to a matter concerning the Maltese Government and Legis-lature, except on the advice of Ministers. If the Governor estab-lished a Trade Union Council without the concurrence of Ministers it might prove, in practice, to be inherently unworkable, and the question of filling the two vacant seats in the Senate would be brought no nearer to a solution. The proposal that the Governor should exercise his power under Section 7 (4) of the Letters Patent in the manner which had been suggested was accordingly abandoned.Possible Methods of dealing with the matter.Under the present circumstances, there are various possibilities for dealing with the matter but all of them present difficulty.
We consider that the Governor under his present powers could not by Ordinance make an alteration in the method of choosing the Trade Union Council. This procedure, in our opinion, is pre-vented by the proviso in Section 4 (i) of the Order in Council of June, 1930, that, in the exercise of his power and authority to make laws,&quot; the Governor shall not make and issue any Ordinance repealing or altering any of the provisions of the Malta Con-stitution Letters Patent, 1921, as amended by subsequent Letters Patent which under Section 41 (6) of the said first-mentioned Letters Patent can be repealed or altered only by the Senate and Legislative Assembly of Malta.&quot;Another possibility would toe that an alteration in the manner of choosing the Trade Union Council should be left to the Malta Legislature. Such an alteration would be an amendment to the Constitution. There is not the least likelihood, under propor-tional representation, of the necessary majorities being obtained to carry such an amendment.Another possibility would be that the leaders of the parties, if they were willing to remove such a stumbling block, should agree for once to have a conference of representatives of all the parties with the object of arriving at an agreed basis for the establishment of a Trade Union Council. The meeting might be presided over by a neutral chairman, and not held under the chair-manship of the Governor, in order that he might not become involved in local politics. At such a meeting it might be possible, if there was sufficient goodwill, to arrive at a reasonable method and procedure for settling this matter, which must always be a difficulty under present circumstances. We strongly recommend that this method of arriving at a solution should be attempted.The only other way of dealing with the matter would be for the Constitution to be altered by an Act of the Imperial Parlia-ment, with the object of securing stability in the representation of the Trade Union Council in the Senate. Should an Imperial Act be decided upon to deal with the Con-stitution generally, this is clearly one of the questions which should be included. The form of the amendment would require careful consideration. There is an absence of bodies in Malta correspond-ing to the Trade Unions of more industrialized countries, though this difficulty, which was acute in 1921, is much less of an obstacle now. The definition of a Trade Union for the purpose of the Trade Union Acts in England does not prevent the attribution of a somewhat different meaning to the expression in Malta in an Act passed for a different purpose, and possibly the inclusion of societies of workmen formed for the purpose of mutual benefit would not  be inconsistent with the provisions of the Letters
Patent. A simple clause in an Imperial Act, on the lines pro-posed by Mr. Bencini, would appear to be sufficient to effect the change which is required in the principle of the Constitution. The question of the conditions which would have to be fulfilled to enable a Trade Union to be placed on the Register could be dealt with under powers to be conferred by the Imperial Act, by subsidiary legislation, i.e., by Letters Patent or by an Order in Council or, preferably, by an Act of the Malta Legislature.With regard to other alterations proposed in the Constitution, our general opinion is that most of them should be asked for or passed by the Maltese themselves, rather than that they should be imposed upon the Maltese by any outside authority upon an occasion which has resulted from a series of circumstances not likely to occur again, and we consider that undue advantage should not be taken of those circumstances.CHAPTER VIII. THE COURTS OF LAW.The Problem of Delays.The Chief Justice, Sir Arturo Mercieca, in his evidence before us, referred to the Royal Commission of 1911, under the chairmanship of iSir Francis Mowatt, which drew attention to the delays in the Law Courts, and he dealt with the suggestions which had been made by that Commission. He said the Commission recommended that, in order to speed up cases, the plaintiff and the defendant should be made competent and compellable witnesses, and that suggestion had been adopted. (Article 110 of Ordinance No. XV of 1913.) Another suggestion made by the Commission was that interlocutory proceedings should be kept separate from the hearing of witnesses and the trial of actions, but that suggestion had not been adopted  &quot; because it is not compatible with the system which we follow.&quot; Nor had the suggestion been adopted that cases for trial should be put in a separate list and the first case in the list tried before the next one began, and, if not finished, proceeded with on the following day. The Chief Justice said the system in Malta was different from that in England, in that, when a suit was instituted, it went immediately before the Court; the trial was elaborated; witnesses were heard; pleadings were heard, and interlocutory decrees were given by the Court by stages until the final judgment was delivered.   The question was asked : &quot;The criticism which the Royal Commission of 1911 made was that from 60 to 100 cases are dealt with by &apos; snippets,&apos;
which means that there are continual delays and the putting off of cases.   Does that still occur here? &quot;and the Chief Justice gave this remarkable answer : &quot; That is necessary, I think, to a certain extent. There are three Judges now. There were two before (in the two Halls of the Civil Court) but a new Judge was appointed a year ago. These three Judges have as many as 300 cases pending before them. They hold from two to three sittings a week. If you put only one or two cases in the list, that will have the effect of delaying the hearing of the 300th case for two or three years. There are other reasons why several cases must be put on the same list, namely, that not all the cases can be dealt with in the same manner. In some cases witnesses must be heard. The hearing of witnesses takes a very long time, because the substance of what they say has to be dictated by the Judge, as the case may go to the Court of Appeal, and as a rule witnesses are not heard before the Court of Appeal.&quot;We had evidence from legal experts on this subject. One of them said the whole system needed reform, because a Judge might have as many as 80 cases on his list, and usually he had 40 or 50. Taking 50 cases, which was about the normal number, each case had to be called. To call each case and wait one minute until the parties or their lawyers came meant that two minutes must be allowed as a minimum for each, so that it took a 100 minutes merely to call the cases. The sitting usually lasted from nine to 12 or from nine to one, which meant that two hours were taken to call the cases and one hour to hear the applications, and each Judge sat about three times a week. On the other three days he was supposed to prepare his judgments. If a Judge had 50 cases on his list he could not do anything in any of them. People from the far side of the Island might have to give up a day&apos;s work to attend the Court, only to be told that their case was adjourned. They waited until 1 o&apos;clock and lost a day&apos;s pay, and they were then told to return in a month&apos;s time, when probably the pro-cedure was repeated.Another witness said he thought the Law Courts would never improve their procedure if they were left to themselves, because there had been complaints against them for the last hundred years. When a Maltese gave evidence the Judge or Magistrate translated the evidence into Italian when the witness had finished, and dictated his version of the evidence to the Eecorder of the Court. It was then translated again into Maltese by an interpreter for the benefit of the witness, or into English in the case of the Services. The examination of witnesses was conducted on a very different system from that prevailing in English Courts.    The121SS H
witness was bombarded with questions from the Counsel in the case and from the Judge, and very often the examination was interrupted by an excited wrangle in Italian between the barristers, which was allowed to go on without interference. In jury cases the jury had to understand Italian, which limited enormously the number of people who could be chosen. Moreover, the knowledge of Italian possessed by some of the jury was often extremely slight.We have received a statement from a lawyer of standing which may throw further light upon the delays in the Courts. He says :  &quot; There is another consideration as well which arises out of the fact that in the local Courts there are usually about two or three Halls (Civil Court, Commercial Court, Court of Appeal, etc.), in which cases are being heard on the same morning, and barristers happen to be busy in pleading before one Court when a case is called in another. It is a frequent occurrence for some barristers to be unavoidably busy in as many as thirty cases before different Courts on the same morning. There is, therefore, a sort of unwritten rule that a barrister should not (unless there be special circumstances) take advantage of a temporary or unavoidable absence of a colleague, or his client so much so that, with barristers of standing, to do so amounts, if not to a breach of professional etiquette, certainly to an act of professional discourtesy to-wards a colleague, all the more inasmuch as reprisals would otherwise be inevitable &quot;.With regard to the details of many cases, including cases of motor accidents and criminal cases before the lower Courts, strong evidence was given before us. The delays and the methods of procedure would appear to be particularly harmful to persons whose business does not keep them continuously in the Island, and to persons in the Naval and Military Forces, who have necessarily to attend to their service duties. Some instances, compiled chiefly from public records, are given in Appendix B and may serve to give some indication of the ordinary result likely to await any litigant in Malta. The mere synopsis of the procedure in these cases carries condemnation.It is not easy to recommend what steps should be taken to improve the position which has been outlined. Any attempted modelling of the Maltese system upon the lines of British procedure would require investigation by officials fully conversant with the present practice of the Law Courts in London and possibly in Scotland, and by lawyers thoroughly versed in the legal procedure and the practice of those Courts, and the methods of Judges.We have not been asked to examine into the details of the Law Courts with a view to advising alterations in procedure, although
1071S6under our reference it is relevant to ascertain how far the question of the administration of justice has entered into the present political situation in the Island. One official witness stated that it was his considered opinion that the state of the Law Courts was one of the chief causes of unrest and of the existing disputes. Attacks upon the law have certainly been a salient feature in the disputes, and improvements in procedure would doubtless have effect in meeting the criticisms which have been applied. It is of the highest im-portance that the law and those who administer and practise the law should not be under the shadow of reproach.It is quite clear to us that no movement in this respect would be inaugurated by the Judges in Malta, who do not appear to be favourable to changes. The Chief Justice, however, gave the following evidence : -&quot; The hearing of witnesses takes a very long time, because the substance of what they say has to be dictated by the Judge, as the case may go to the Court of Appeal, and as a rule witnesses are not heard before the Court of Appeal.&quot; (Q.) Are there any shorthand writers? There are not, so far. There has been a suggestion to that effect, but so fax- it has not been accepted.&quot; (Q.) Can the parties to a case, if they desire it and if they are prepared to pay for it, have the proceedings taken down in shorthand? So far they cannot get the assistance of a shorthand writer, even if they are prepared to pay for it, but I understand that a Board has lately been appointed by the Government for the purpose of considering and sug-suggesting some amendments to the Laws and Civil Procedure, and I think a suggestion to that effect has been submitted by that Board.&quot; (Q.) With a view to hastening procedure? That is so. There are some inconveniences, because as a rule a witness should be heard orally. The Court must take into considera-tion not only what he says, but the way in which he says it, and the way he behaves before the Court. In my opinion the suggestion of appointing shorthand writers should be adhered to, with the condition that the witnesses should be heard before the Court, as a rule.&quot; (Q.) You mean that the witness should appear again if required by the Court? Yes. Then it would not be neces-sary for the Judge to dictate a note of what the witness has said, except when he puts in some changes. I do think that would shorten the proceedings very much. At the root of all the delay is the hearing of witnesses, I think.&quot;12158h 2
The Report on Procedure.The Board to which the Chief Justice alluded without disapproval consisted of a Committee of the Treasury Counsel, Dr. Pullicino, a lawyer of ability, aided by two Maltese lawyers well versed in the practice of the Courts and well known at the Bar of Malta. Their draft report was shown to us, although we did not consider it our duty, without sufficient knowledge of the practice, to do more than make some suggestions, which we were given to under-stand were adopted unanimously.This report is an unanimous report, and, although it would entail the appointment of some more officers for the purpose of preparing cases for hearing by the Judges and also the appoint-ment of a certain number of shorthand writers, who would prob-ably have to be skilled in writing shorthand in three languages, a mode of writing Maltese shorthand having been recently pro-duced, we think that the report should be considered by the Governor and the Colonial Office and, so far as possible, adopted. There are proposed clauses as to the names and statements of witnesses being given in advance, which might lead to abuse; but in some cases this procedure appears to have been followed satis-factorily. Although new officers would be appointed, the ultimate result would probably be that economies would be effected by a reduction in the number of Judges as vacancies occurred, if the Judges sat more frequently and for a greater number of hours, and if the hearings were expedited by the preparation of documents. We advise that the recommendations in this report, in the form in which they may be modified, should, if practicable, be adopted by the enactment of an Ordinance by the Governor, but suggest that the lower Courts should have their jurisdiction extended to a larger amount than is proposed in the report.The Appointment of Judges.With regard to the position of the Judges, and particularly of the Court of Appeal, in election matters, we have already said that we do not think it practicable to bring in English Assessors, as suggested by the Constitutional Party, and that the Court of Appeal is the only body in Malta upon which the power of trying election cases could be conferred. The criti-criticism of Judges for delay, which we have mentioned in regard to the procedure of the Courts, is said not to apply7 to the trial of election cases, which appear to have been generally heard as a matter of urgency. The real root of the matter lies in the continual innuendo that the Judges are appointed too often from nominees of one political party and that the whole Bench is practically of
one political colour and brings political bias into the law. We do not say that this accusation is validly founded, but the accusations-tion exists, and it would be well that, in the interests of the law, on occasion and where it is feasible, some appointments should be made which could not be designated as partial.The present system of appointment by the Governor in Council is contrary to the advice of the late Chief Justice, Sir M. A. Refalo, that &quot;for the independence, prestige, and dignity of the Courts, Judges should continue to be appointed by His Majesty the King as heretofore.&quot;The appointment of Judges is not a reserved matter, and Section 55 of the Constitution Letters Patent, 1921, which deals with the appointment of Judges, is not one of the Sections with regard to which Your Majesty was pleased to reserve the power of revocation or amendment. The provision regarding the appoint-ment of Judges could not, under the Letters Patent of 1921, be altered by other Letters Patent, and the Ministry in power, which advises the Governor on the question of the appointment of Judges, may not be willing or able to obtain a two-thirds majority in each House of the Maltese Legislature to amend Section 55. If an Imperial Act is passed, we advise that there should be a reversion to the former system. Before the Constitution was granted, as stated by the Chief Justice, Judges were appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Secretary of State. In their appointment, the Secretary of State consulted the Governor and the Governor invariably consulted the Chief Justice and the Crown Advocate. At present the appointment has been trans-ferred to the Governor in Council, which means that the Governor appoints as advised by the Ministers, and has not the opportunity of attempting to secure Judges not necessarily known for strong adherence to a political party.In accordance with the advice of the present Chief Justice, Sir Arturo Mercieca, the rule should also be introduced that no person be appointed a Judge unless he has had at least twelve years&apos; practice at the Bar. We would suggest that any years of service on the magisterial bench should also be reckoned as a qualification.Further Points mentioned by the Chief Justice.The Chief Justice also proposed that the salaries of Judges should be again raised to  800, on the ground that the Judges believed their salaries were reduced because it was thought that the cost of living would diminish and that all other Civil Servants would have their salaries reduced, whereas neither of these events occurred.   He also complained that, since the Constitution had
been granted, although the Chief Justice and the other Judges had sometimes been consulted upon the distribution of their duties, in other cases they had not been so consulted. He submitted that the exercise of this power by the Governor, as advised by his Ministers, had given cause for serious inconvenience, consisting in an undue interference with the work of the Courts and in a privilege given to the Government in cases to which it was a party. The Chief Justice especially mentioned his own removal from the Criminal Court on the 18th August, 1927, although the Criminal Court in jury cases had always been presided over by the Chief Justice. He complained to Lord Strickland about this action and was again appointed to preside over the Criminal Court on the 31st August, 1927. He complained further of delays on the part of the Government in appointing another Judge in place of Judge Camilleri in the case of two election petitions when Judge Camilleri was ill, of the redistribution of Judges in a manner different from that which was usual, of the substitution by the Government of redistribution of judicial work in place of the previous system of automatic surrogation, and that such redistribution-tion had been carried out by the Head of the Ministry when it ought to have been done by the Governor, that surrogation had been unduly delayed in the case of an election petition in July, 1928, and that the Court of Appeal had to remain without a Judge for the hearing for a number of days, although a decree of urgency had been delivered with regard to the case, in which the Minister for Justice himself was a party. The Chief Justice said that the Minister for Justice had then put on the Court of Appeal a newly-appointed junior Judge, who was the Judge that the Minister for Justice wanted.We do not think that we can advise any definite procedure upon these various points.Minor Amendment to Reserved Civil List Recommended.There is one small matter, connected with the salary of one of the Judges, which, if and when any Letters Patent are issued, might well be inserted. Up to the time of the appointment of Judge L. A. Camilleri, in March, 1930, the number of Judges was five, excluding the Chief Justice. In 1930, the Government decided to appoint a sixth Judge when there was available a saving of only  600 on the total provision of  5,400 mentioned in Schedule A to the Letters Patent of 1921, as the amount allocated for the payment of the Judges, a saving effected by reduction of the salaries of Judges. Judge Camilleri was appointed in March, 1930, at a salary of  700 a year, the amount paid to the other Judges, of which  600 was available under the Reserved Civil List and  100
had to be voted by the Legislature. The Judge received a letter of appointment at a salary of  600, but he actually received  700. On the 10th March, 1930, it was stated in the Executive Council that it was the intention of the Government to submit legislation to alter the Letters Patent so that the whole salary of  700 should be protected under the Reserved Civil List. The Reserved Civil List Section, Section 63 (1) of the Constitution Letters Patent of 1921, can be amended under Section 68 of the Letters Patent. It is undesirable that a portion of the salary of a single Judge should be the subject of a vote of the Legislature and offer an opportunity for criticism of the Bench as a whole ; and we think that toy Letters Patent the Reserved Civil List might be amended, so that the provision for Judges should be raised from , 5,400 to  5,500, and that Judge Camilleri should receive from the Reserved Civil List a similar remuneration to that of the other Judges.CHAPTER IX.-THE LANGUAGE QUESTION.Closely interwoven with the subject of Law there is the ques-tion of Language. Language is a subject dealt with by Sections 40 and 57 of the Constitution Letters Patent, and those Sections were expressly reserved by Section 68, which states, inter alia : We do hereby reserve to Ourselves, Our heirs and successors, full power and authority from time to time to revoke, alter or amend . . . sections 40 . . . 57 . . . of these Our Letters Patent as to Us or Them shall seem meet.&quot;Changes proposed by Constitutional and Labour Parties.The language question was placed in the forefront of their sugges-tions by the Constitutional and Labour Parties. The Constitutional Party made the proposal that Italian should be removed from its position as an official language and should not be the language of the Law Courts but that Maltese should be substituted for Italian in the Law Courts, in copies of laws proposed or enacted, and in the journals, entries, minutes and proceedings of the Senate and Legislative Assembly, except where debates and discussions had been conducted in Italian.The present Section 40 dealing with the matter in the Constitu-tion Letters Patent of 1921 reads as follows : -&quot; 40. (1) All debates and discussions in the Senate and Legislative Assembly shall be  conducted in  the  English,
Italian or Maltese language, and in no other language, and every speech delivered in either of the said Houses shall be printed in the journals and proceedings of that House in the language in which it was delivered, provided that any speech delivered in the Maltese language shall not be printed in that language but either in the English or the Italian language at the option of the Member who delivered such speech.(2) Copies of all laws proposed or enacted shall be printed both in the English and Italian languages, which shall for this purpose be of equal force and validity.(3) Save as aforesaid all journals, entries, minutes and proceedings of the Senate and Legislative Assembly shall be made and recorded in the English language, or in both the English and Italian languages as the Senate or Legislative Assembly may from time to time respectively decide.&quot;The amendments proposed by the Constitutional Party, if adopted, would cause the Section to read as follows : r&apos; 40. (1) All debates and discussions in the Senate and Legislative Assembly shall be conducted in the English, Italian or Maltese language, and in no other language, and every speech delivered in either of the said Houses shall be printed in the journals and proceedings of that House in the language in which it was delivered.&quot; (2) Copies of all laws proposed or enacted shall be printed both in the English and Maltese languages, which shall for this purpose be of equal force and validity.&quot; (3) Save as aforesaid all journals, entries, minutes and proceedings of the Senate and Legislative Assembly shall be made and recorded in the English language, or in both the English and Maltese languages as the Senate or Legislative Assembly may from time to time respectively decide.&quot;The amendment proposed by the Labour Party went still further, as it proposed to omit Italian from the languages permissible in debates and discussions in the Senate and Legislative Assembly and in the prints of speeches.There are also the provisions in Section 57, on the question of language, equally dealing with a reserved subject and being capable of being revoked, altered, or amended under Section 68.Section 57 runs as follows : &quot; Subject to the provisions of section 40 as to the language to be employed in the debates, proceedings, laws and records
of the Legislature the following provisions as to language shall take effect in Malta : (I) The English language, as the official language of the British Empire, and the Italian language, as the estab-lished language of record of Our Courts of Law in Malta, shall be the official languages of Malta. The English language shall be the official language of administration, and all official records and public documents and all notices of general public importance or interest issued by the Maltese Government shall be in that language, without prejudice, however, to the use of Italian as a second official language of administration accompanying the English text in such records, documents, and notices as afore-said, in so far as may be found desirable and convenient. Nothing shall be done by way either of legislation or of administration which shall diminish or detract from the position of the English language as an official language or tend to restrict its use in education or in the public service. The Maltese language, as the language of popular inter-course, shall enjoy all such facilities as are necessary to satisfy the reasonable needs of those who are not suffi-ciently conversant with the English or Italian language.(2) The English and Italian languages shall be recog-nised as equal languages of culture in Malta at the Univer-sity, in Secondary Schools and in the higher classes of Elementary Schools as subjects of study. &quot;Where both languages cannot conveniently be taken simultaneously regard shall be had in settling the order or priority in which the languages shall be taught to the wishes of the parents in the case of Schools, and of the students in the case of the University, and to the utility of the teaching for the purposes of the pupiTs future occupation.The foregoing provisions shall not extend to prohibit the Maltese language from being used in the lower classes of the Elementary Schools in so far as it may be neces-sary as a medium of instruction.t3) Subject to the provisions of the Malta (Use of English Language in Legal Proceedings) Order in Council, 1899, the Italian language shall be the official language of record of Our Courts of Law in Malta, provided, how-ever, that for the words &quot; a British subject or British sub-jects not being born or naturalized in Malta &quot;, wherever they occur in Article 2 of the said Order in Council, there shall be deemed to be substituted the words &quot; A person or persons who declares or declare that he or they has or have not sufficient knowledge of the Italian language
fully to understand and follow all the proceedings if conducted in that language and that he or they has or have sufficient knowledge of the English language fully to understand and follow all the proceedings if conducted in that language &quot;, and provided further that for the words &quot; A British subject not being born or naturalized in Malta &quot; in Article 11 of the said Order in Council there shall be deemed to be substituted the wrords &quot; A person who declares that he has not sufficient knowledge of the Italian language fully to understand and follow all the proceedings if conducted in that language and that he has sufficient knowledge of the English language fully to understand and follow all the proceedings if conducted in that language &apos;&apos; and the said Articles and the provisions of the Criminal Laws of Malta and of the Laws of Organization and Civil Procedure of Malta respectively as amended by the said Articles shall be read and con-strued accordingly &quot;.If the proposed amendments were adopted the Section would read as follows : &quot; Subject to the provisions of Section 40 as to the language to be employed in the debates, proceedings, laws and records of the Legislature the following provisions as to language shall take effect in Malta : (1) The English language, as the official language of the British Empire, and the Maltese language as the national language, shall be the official languages of Malta. The English language shall be the official language of of administration, and all official records and public docu-ments and all notices of general public importance or interest issued by the Maltese Government shall be in that language, without prejudice, however, to the use of Maltese as a second official language of administration accompanying the English text in such records, docu-ments, and notices as aforesaid, in so far as may be found desirable and convenient. Nothing shall be done by way either of legislation or of administration which shall diminish or detract from the position of the English language as an official language or tend to restrict its use in education or in the public service.(2) The English language shall be the principal language of culture and the medium of instruction at the University, at the Secondary Schools and in the Elementary Schools.Provided that nothing in this Section shall debar the teaching of Maltese and its use as a medium of instruction
in the Elementary Schools, or the teaching of Italian as an optional subject at the request of the Students in the University and in the Secondary Schools, or the use of Latin as a medium of instruction in the Faculty of Theology in the University.(3) The English and Maltese languages are substituted for Italian as the language of Legislation and of the Courts of Law.(4) Any law relating to any matters dealt with under the provisions of these Sections shall be read subject to these provisions and to any Regulations which the Gov-ernor may publish thereunder by Proclamation; and any law which is repugnant to these provisions or to any regu-lations made thereunder shall to the extent of such re-pugnancy be void and inoperative.(5) The provisions in Subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this Section shall come into force on the 1st October, 1934, and the Governor shall have power to make Regulations having the force of law by Proclamation published in the Government Gazette, by which temporary provisions may be made to deal with administrative and other questions affected by this Section and within the provisions and purport thereof during a period of transition, viz., between the date of the Letters Patent and the 1st day of January, 1934.&quot;There is also a provision in Section 51 as follows : &quot; The Governor shall cause every law to which he shall have assented in Our name or to which We shall have given Our assent as aforesaid to be printed in the Gazette, in both the English and Italian languages, for general information.&quot;It was suggested to us that this should be amended to read as follows : &quot; The Governor shall cause every law to which he shall have assented in Our name or to which We shall have given Our assent as aforesaid to be printed in the Gazette, in both the English and Maltese languages, for general information.&quot;These proposed amendments are very drastic and would create a great ferment in the Island among the very vocal sections of the people who follow the legal profession, and among a certain number of educated people who contend that Italian is and must remain the cultural language of the Island.Obstacles to Use of English in the Courts.Maltese laws, particularly civil and commercial, are based almost entirely on Italian legislative types, and Maltese jurisprudence is
wholly founded on Italian or, more widely, Latin precedent. The comparatively rudimentary Maltese vernacular in its present form could not, in our opinion, displace Italian in the law in the summary manner which has been suggested, and even the proposal to sub-stitute English presents considerable difficulties. There are obstacles to conveying by way of translation into English the true meaning and the precise bearing of laws founded on the Italian or Latin system.Political Controversies on the Language Question.In view of the wide scope of our terms of reference it was not possible to exclude an examination of the language question from the sphere of our inquiry, and it has been officially stated in the House of Commons that such an inquiry was included. On the other hand, language has liot been the main issue put forward by the local political parties at the elections of 1921, 1924, and 1927.A great deal of evidence was given upon the question, and it is difficult to condense the long arguments which were adduced in favour of the different languages. On the opening of the evidence the Constitutional Party put forward their proposals, which were accompanied by a long and much pressed statement that the use of the Italian language was the cause of the present troubles. One of the main contentions of this Party attributed a theory of &quot; Italianity &quot; to the use of this language. The theory involved accusations of propaganda and penetration by a neighbouring and friendly nation, the existence of a party in Malta devoted to the theory of &quot;Italianity &quot; in a political sense under the guise of the defence of culture, and in some cases thinly veiled suggestions of disloyalty. On the other hand, in contradiction to this view, the Nationalist witnesses maintained that the language question had nothing to do with the present difficulties, and they argued in favour of Italian that it was the hall-mark of culture in the Island and had been the language of the Courts of Law for many hundreds of years.No Drastic Change Recommended.The subject, as has been mentioned, can be dealt with under Section 68 of the Constitution Letters Patent, which permits of amendments to Sections 40 and 57, and it would be possible for these Sections to be altered in the manner put forward in the pro-posals. We do not think that in the present condition of affairs so drastic a change should he made, nor do we consider that the argument that the use of the Italian language is the cause of all the present troubles has been or can be substantiated.
But Extended Use of English and Maltese in Trials Suggested.Italian, no doubt, is supported by the sections of the Constitution quoted above, but its common use does not appear to be increasing in the Island; on the contrary, it appears to have been decreasing. It is, however, the language upon which the law is based and it lends itself far better than Maltese, in the present condition of that language, to legal judgments and arguments. Although permission is now given to have notarial deeds made in Maltese a permission for various reasons not much used all the old notarial deeds re-lating to property are in the Latin or Italian languages. There have been provisions made that Maltese can be used in the Law Courts, particularly in criminal cases, and those provisions should continue. We consider that the extension of the use of the Maltese language in the Courts might be reasonably based upon an enactment by Letters Patent that all proceedings in connexion with the trial of an accused person shall be conducted in Maltese when the accused person speaks Maltese as the principal language to which he is accustomed, and that the jurors trying such an accused person need not be conversant with the Italian language. There has quite recently been published by the Government, in 666 Sections, a codification of the Criminal Law in Maltese, &quot; Ligijiet Criminali Ghall-Gzira Ta&apos; Malta U L-Gzejjer Li Jaghmlu Maghha &quot;  perhaps more suitably &apos;&apos; Mahha &apos;&apos; &apos;&apos; Criminal Laws (Code of Law) for the Island of Malta and its Dependencies,&quot; which puts the Criminal Law in many ways upon a different basis from that of the Civil Law. We think that such a provision would be welcomed generally in the Island, that it would be fair to accused persons and that it would undoubtedly enable trials to be conducted with greater speed. The same principle should be applied in the case of an accused person whose language is English, where the trial should be in English. No difficulty seems to have been experienced in using Maltese in the lower Courts, where that language is chiefly employed. Apart from this, we are not prepared to suggest an interference with the use of Italian in the Law Courts. Experience may lead to a further extension of the use of a language which litigants who understand Maltese only would naturally desire. Litigants would select the counsel and the language most likely to improve their chances of success. Development upon these lines would, we think, be preferable to any suggestion for the compulsory substitution of Maltese for Italian as the official language of the Courts.Language in Education.We consider that in other respects the subject ought to be con-sidered and treated in the interests of the people and quite apart from legal requirements and political purposes, and we have no
doubt that, in the interests of the people, a change should be made in the case of education in the elementary schools and in the entrance examinations to secondary schools, and in that connexion we would venture to offer a few remarks about the Maltese language.The Origins of the Maltese Language.While numerous peoples have occupied the Islands for varying periods, by virtue of the sea power which they possessed in the Mediterranean, the Maltese have always maintained a tenacious hold over their own language. Necessarily with the advance of different types of civilization and of science it has largely borrowed, like every other language, from different nations and particularly from Italian and in recent times from English sources, but its main basis has remained.We are not prepared to lay down any theory concerning the origin of this language. The best deduction appears to be that it is derived from a very ancient language of the Semitic group, treasured through thousands of years by a people who, although mainly engaged in toilsome agriculture, evidently possessed work-men skilled in the art of building. This language, brought by early settlers, has been isolated by the geographical position of the Island from close contact with the Semitic groups extending through the southern Mediterranean, though akin to some of them in many forms of speech and words. The original language remains noticeable in topographical names, hills, watercourses, ancient hamlets, rocks, and other natural features. Many of these words are unknown in modern Arabic. Maltese still remains the basic language, with a Semitic grammar and syntax and with power of expansion, but with a very limited number of stems. All Maltese speak it, and it is the only language used by the people of the countryside.Professor Sir Themistocles Zammit, in his evidence before us, made some interesting remarks upon the language, as follows : &quot; (Q). Your view is that Maltese ought to be studied for the purposes of writing and reading far more than it is studied at present? Yes, the study of Maltese would greatly help the child who leaves school after five years; it would help him to read or write a letter and to keep an account in Maltese. . . . There are thousands of Maltese outside the Island who could easily correspond with their families here- in Maltese. ... At one time there was a war against Maltese. They said that the teaching of Maltese would isolate the child from the rest of the world, because Maltese is only used here in Malta. . . . That is why they insist upon leaving Maltese alone and not
teaching it. . . . Now the people are beginning to understand that Maltese is important at least as a means of learning other languages. I cannot imagine how one could teach a Maltese child a foreign language except through his own. . . .&quot; (Q). He will not understand a word? Exactly. And yet this system has been kept up practically up to now.&quot; (Q). Perhaps one of the difficulties was that there were no simple books in Maltese? But that could have been easily remedied. . . .&quot; (Q). Is there any good dictionary in Maltese? There are two good dictionaries : one in Maltese, Italian, and English, and another in Maltese and Italian. The first one is the work of a certain Ealzon.   It is practically a copy of VassahYsdictionary.....It is in two volumes.  It was published ....about fifty years ago (1882). Then there is another one by Caruana (1903) .... in Maltese and Italian. I think that the principles of religion and science and of general education should be taught to the child in Maltese, and there should be lots of elementary books in their hands. I tried once to write a little history in Maltese to give an idea of what a Maltese child should know about local history. ... I will read the dedication of the book. . . . It is in Maltese, but I will translate it into English.1 &apos; To my brothers the Maltese, so that they could remember that, although small in size, the Island that gave them birth is very great in history and very rich in honour.&apos; There is no political bias in that booklet. I am sorry to say that that booklet did not sell. I think it (Maltese) is the basis of the whole question and it will solve many problems which appear to be insoluble. . . .&quot; (Q.) May I take it generally from your close study of these subjects that the old innuendo that Maltese is a poor patois of a lot of bad Arabic is a gross libel? It is, absolutely; it is a language.&quot; (Q.) And it is an ancient and interesting language?  Yes. In all languages some parts are easily lost and are retained in other languages.&quot; (Q.) It is far more useful, being the language of the people and a living language, than is generally supposed, and it is not correct to call it a made-up language? No. Every child from the lowest to the highest talks nothing but Maltese. In intercourse with everybody in the Island, Maltese alone is used. I have never heard anybody talking Italian or English in a private house except those who are indirectly connected with the Italians or with the English people. So you cannot ignore Maltese, especially as a language for a child to graft upon it another language &quot;.
The existence of a cultured pre-Phoenician population is sup-ported by the extraordinary &quot; finds &quot; and excavations made in many places both in Malta and in Gozo. Whether these early builders remained to hand down a language or not, the Maltese language is of great antiquity. On this point we may adduce the testimonies of many writers, especially those of the noted Semitic authority, Father Dhorme, OP. (&quot; Langues et Ecritures Semitiques&quot;, Paris, 1930, and the books there cited), who speaks of &quot; the ancient idiom of the Islands &quot; and those of Sir T. Zammit.Of later sojourners and conquerors there is, comparatively speak-ing, little trace. There is barely any Phoenician pottery. Ancient Maltese vases, sherds, and household utensils are older in type and shape than any Phoenician pottery ware. The Islands were probably one of the halting places of the Phoenicians on their journeys in the Mediterranean and in distant seas, though there was possibly considerable Phoenician immigration. Two bilingual inscriptions, one of which is at Valletta and the other in the Louvre, are dedicated to Melquart, the Baal of Tyre, who is identified as Heracles in the Greek text. They are dated about the second century B.C. (Father Dhorme). The Carthaginians have also left in Malta traces of their language and writing, a type of funerary urn, and a shape for rock tombs. There are a few Greek inscrip-tions. The Eomans left coins, well preserved mosaic floors, the bases of buildings in a few farms, a Christian cemetery, and rock tombs. The Saracens, who from about A.D. 870 held the Islands for over two hundred years, had a cemetery near the hill of Citta Vecchia and jxractically no graves anywhere else. About twenty-seven Arabic inscriptions have been collected.* Of the Normans from Sicily there are forts, watch towers, churches, and some houses in Citta Vecchia and Gozo. The Spaniards and Sicilians erected some buildings at a later date and brought in various words and phrases. Of the Knights of Malta there are, of course, the well known fortifications at Valletta, palaces, hospitals, country houses, and churches. The British have added more fortifications, barracks, hospitals, many roads, an aerodrome, a wireless station, and modem houses.None of these people appear to have much affected the race in blood, in tenacity of adherence to the soil, or actually in type of language, though the old Semitic language has proved elastic to adaptation of words to changing modes of life and new ideas.* Vide Rossi, E. Le Lapidi Sepolcrali Arabo-Musulmanc di Malta. Bivista degli Studi Orientali, Vol. XII. Home, 1931.
The Use of Italian.The British, on taking the Island from the French conquerors at the beginning of the nineteenth century and being confirmed in their possession in 1814, found Italian the official language and the language of education, of the Law Courts, of the learned professions, and of the University. English was proclaimed the official lan-guage of the administration, but little was done to encourage its more general use.Italian was used for all notarial documents, having gradually superseded Latin. The Grand Master of the Knights, Emmanuel de Rohan, in 1784, incorporated the Code of Grand Master Antonio Manoel de Vilhena, dated the 15th November, 1723, and added much of his own, including various legal customs. His Code is still treated with great respect in the Maltese Courts. In 1836, Sir George Cornewall Lewis and Mr. Austin, Royal Commissioners, suggested that Italian should remain the official language, on the ground that Italian was of chief service to trade in the mediterranean-nean. At that time there was no emigration to English-speaking countries and no world-wide trade through the Mediterranean Sea.Maltese the Vernacular Language.The small educated class of the Maltese speak English and Italian, nearly all of them both languages, in addition to their native Maltese. Maltese is the language of most of the sermons, in the shops, markets, streets, and public meetings, on election platforms, and in a growing vernacular Press. Italian has its chief footing in the University, law, medicine, and the Church, but it is not known by the majority of the people.Obstacles to the Use of English.Turning from Maltese to English, it may be noted that, in addition to the fact that very little was done in the earlier years of British rule to extend knowledge of the English language, that language has been under the following disadvantages : (1) Parents since 1923 have had no voice as to the language which is to be taught to their children. The privilege of choice was permitted during the previous 21 years, and it is said that over 97 per cent, chose English.(2) Candidates for the Church are trained in Italian and the influence and sentiment of the Church have been, and still are, favourable to the use of that language.(3) Italian as well as English is compulsory in the elementary schools, under Act IX of 1923, from the third standard, and in the secondary schools and the University.(4) Language has been made a question of politics.
(5) Special provisions of the Constitution maintained the use of Italian.(6) Act IX of 1923, enforcing &quot; pan passu &quot; instruction in English and Italian not only in secondary but also in elementary schools, has prevented children in those schools acquiring any useful knowledge of either English or Italian. Such a system, indeed, seems contrary to the spirit of Section 57 (1) of the Constitution, which states : &quot; Nothing shall be done by way either of legislation or of administration which shall diminish or detract from the position of the English language as an official lan-guage or tend to restrict its use in education or in the public service.&quot;Recent Improvement in Education.In other points the educational system which has been followed and developed of late years shows considerable improvement over any methods that existed prior to the establishment of the Con-stitution. We think that the establishment of the Constitution has led to much greater interest being taken in education by the people of Malta.Although financial considerations have hindered progress to a certain extent, the improvement is marked, both in the manner in which training centres have been formed for teachers and in the gradual settling down of methods of education. At first teachers were few and of poor quality, so that the first problem was to pro-vide an efficient staff. The existing teachers would not have been able to pass the Senior Oxford Examination, and for a time the Junior Oxford was made the final examination in the training of school teachers. Success in examinations and teaching efficiency were the two factors put before them, good results in which had to be obtained to ensure promotion. Intending teachers began to study, and eventually the final examination at the training school was raised to the present standard, which is the Senior Oxford Local Examination.The Training of Teachers.In September, 1921, the Director of Elementary Schools aimed at forming a central school in Valletta, with a view to the training of children as teachers from an early age. After children had passed the whole elementary course of two infant and six elementary standards, they underwent an examination and were drafted for three years into this central school.   After three years
there they passed an examination corresponding to the Junior Oxford and were taken on as pupil teachers. The scheme does not seem to have been supported by Mgr. Ferris, the first Minister for Public Instruction after the establishment of the Constitution, but his successor, Mgr. Dandria, did much valuable work for the extension of the system. A central school was opened in G-ozo and two in Malta, and subsequently a third. After mixed schools were forbidden a short time ago by the Church, a central school for boys oidy was started in Valletta, to which the boys were brought for training as teachers. These five schools were not found to be enough, and a higher central school was started, for which a certain number of teachers were brought from England and in which the Senior Oxford was established as the standard. It is probable that the system in the higher central school will be extended to the other central schools, and the earlier stages of the training will thus be further strengthened. A difficulty arises from the fact that the pay of teachers is low, and a clever boy who joins the staff takes the first opportunity of leaving it. The girls have not such opportunities of other employment, and for that reason the exist-ing higher central school is confined to girls. There is little value in sending boys to a higher school for teachers until the pay of teachers in Government schools can be improved, since, owing to the lack of openings, they would leave before or as soon as they had finished their course.Introduction of Compulsory Attendance.In 1924, by Act XXII of that year, compulsory attendance was established. Under this system parents are not obliged to send their children to school, but, once a child begins to attend, attend-ance is compulsory under the law. The result is that accommoda-tion cannot be found for ail those who should attend, and, with a population increasing at the rate of nearly 3,000 a year, it is not easy to keep pace with the demand for education. Prior to the Act, children attended school until the age of 11 or 12 and then the parents withdrew them. At present they are supposed to remain at school until the age of 14 or until they have passed the final examination of the highest class in the school. The lack of an efficient staff is, however, a greater difficulty than the lack of accommodation.The Director of Elementary Schools informed us that on 25 per cent of the school days the children were absent, since full advan-tage was taken of the Compulsory Attendance Act, which permits children to be absent for 25 per cent of the time. The Compulsory Attendance Act is supposed to ensure that when children are sent to school they are obliged to remain there up to the age of 14 years,
unless they reach a certain standard at an earlier age or are too dull and backward to take advantage of further education, in which case, owing to the pressure of applicants, the children leave at the age of 12 to make room for others. The teachers, moreover, have no power to enforce attendance by any system of punishment. The control of the children depends upon the personality of the teachers.The Infant Schools.Children are supposed to join the infant schools at the age of 5, but, owing to the large number annually reaching that age, they are sometimes 6 years old on entry. At that age they know nothing but Maltese and cannot read or write. The system is for the first few weeks to concentrate attention on trying to develop the power of self-expression and trying to make the child feel at home. Some instruction in English, using Maltese as the medium of instruction, is started on the first day, the children being taught nursery rhymes, etc. They appreciate the lilt and rhythm, even when they do not understand the words, and thus they acquire the beginning of a vocabulary and some idea of the rhythm of English. Teach-ing is continued by the combined analytic method, the word being taught before the letter. The children are made to connect the whole word with a picture, so that the picture suggests the word and the word the picture. In the first year the English short vowels, corresponding to the Italian vowels, are taught, and thus before commencing Italian the children learn the Italian phonic sounds by their slight knowledge of English. By copying the script word on the blackboard, the children learn to write and to connect the written word with the spoken word. The long vowels A, E, O, and U, are next taught, and then the children are ready for an elementary school.The Elementary Schools.In the elementary school, in the first two standards, the children learn English only, through the medium of Maltese. Up to that point the results are on the whole satisfactory. From Standard 3 upwards Act IX of 1923, generally called the Pari Passu Act, comes into operation, and both English and Italian have to be taught, and every certificate and departmental notice has to be issued in both languages. The result is that in the case of boys a maximum of seven hours a week can be devoted to English and seven hours to Italian. In the case of girls, who do needlework and housecraft in addition, the maximum period is six hours. An English school child would devote to his own language one-third to one-fourth of the weekly time-table, that is to say, from seven tos.....
Disadvantages of the Present System.The present system results in neither English nor Italian being learned; it restricts the number of children who can go to school; it restricts facilities for getting an adequate staff; it prevents the children learning to read and write in Maltese; it is expensive, and it is contrary to the considered advice given at the Imperial Education Conference of 1923 by the Committee appointed to con-sider the treatment of the bilingual and trilingual problem of learn-ing languages. At that Conference the Committee reported that bilingual teaching within the British Empire necessarily implies as an aim the acquisition of a competent knowledge of English, and that the learning of a third language is not as a rule desirable before the pupil enters the secondary school stage.As a mere matter of time, no child can learn two languages of the European type through the medium of Maltese at so early an age with any approach to a knowledge of either of them. Maltese isnine hours and is taught other subjects through the same medium. In Malta boys can devote only seven hours and girls only six hours to each of two languages neither of which is their mother tongue. Many of the teachers are very weak in English and also in Italian, and Maltese is always spoken in the home and outside the school. In addition, it must be remembered that the children are absent for one-fourth of the scholastic year. The lack of time alone makes the system at this early age of small value.Many parents wish their children to take the Dockyard examina-tion, which does not include Italian, and, not wishing their children to use then; time in learning that language but desiring them to concentrate on learning the subjects necessary for them to pass the Dockyard examination, send them to private schools, to which the Act does not apply. That means that the children whose parents cannot afford to send them to private schools are handicapped.Those boys who wish to compete for the secondary schools have to receive special instruction in both English and Italian grammar and arithmetic after school hours. Although only a Small number are concerned, special arrangements for instruction have to be made.As for the children&apos;s own language, throughout school life the children are taught Maltese for, say, one hour a week. If Italian was deferred until entry into the secondary schools, there would be a much better chance of children afterwards learning more of both English and Italian, and also learning at least how to read and write the language of then own Island.
necessarily the medium of instruction because the children on enter-ing into school life have no knowledge of any other language.We have information from the best English and Erench schools and find that two languages are not taught at so early a stage of education by means of the native language, and that a much better knowledge of two languages can be acquired if the second language is taken up at a later age, when a child has better mental development than would be possessed by any children in elementary schools.An argument adduced for the teaching of Italian in the elemen-tary schools was that otherwise the poorer children would be handi-capped if they desired to proceed to the secondary schools, for which at present it is necessary to pass an entrance examination in Italian, and thence eventually to enter one of the professions; but our opinion is that Italian should not form part of the entrance examination for secondary schools. At the present time girls do not enter the professions, nor are they likely to do so for many years to come, yet Italian is at present obligatory in the elemen-tary schools for girls.The Position of Maltese.It may be briefly stated, with regard to the claims of these languages, that Maltese is the national language of the Island. Maltese can have only a limited extension, but it has always held a position of great strength. In spite of this, the language cannot at present be claimed as a key to knowledge. Maltese literature itself is comparatively in the infancy of development. Maltese must be used as the medium, and a very useful medium, of educa-tion, because Maltese children know no other language, but it is not useful in the attainment of higher education. The Maltese people are undoubtedly anxious to retain and will retain the language which they have used for more centuries than can be estimated. The claim for its extended use is becoming almost a badge of the aspirations of the Maltese to express themselves as a self-governing community having its own language. Behind the aspirations is the practical desire of the many who have to emigrate to be able to communicate in their own language with their families who know Maltese and Maltese only. At present, as has been noted, Maltese is not used as an official language, and the official position is shared by the English and Italian languages.The Usefulness of English.As to English, bilingual teaching within the British Empire would seem necessarily to imply as an end the acquisition of a
Italian the Language of the Law and of Culture.Italian is a language useful to those who travel outside Malta in the Mediterranean area, and to the few who go to Italy. As Latin gradually fell out of use, Italian seems to have become, under the suzerainty of the King of the Two Sicilies, the current language used in the international government and society of the Knights of Malta, and especially so at the end of the eighteenth century. It has increased in use in the Law Courts during the centuries and was the medium of cultural expression in literature. It is claimed to be the traditional language of the more cultured upper class.In the Law Courts, English and Italian have the predominance, though Maltese is permissible in certain cases. As far as we have been able to ascertain, the principle that a Maltese accused person should be tried in Maltese and an English accused person in English is not a principle which could interfere with the culture of the Island, and its adoption would tend to a fair trial of accused persons who cannot well speak for themselves. We had the oppor-tunity of consulting several Maltese lawyers on the point, and there was a general agreement that a change was desirable.Suggested Exclusion of Italian from Elementary Schools.With regard to the schools, our opinion is that in the elementary schools Maltese should be taught in a greater measure than at present, and English only, through the medium of Maltese, as a second language to be taught in those schools, the teaching of Italian commencing in the secondary schools, and no Italian test being required for entry into those schools. This opinion is ex-pressed absolutely apart from politics and with a view to the interest of the children and the parents; to all the children who go to school having the advantage of a good grounding in their owncompetent knowledge of English. At present the Maltese are behindhand in this respect, owing to the system of education. We were informed that parents are in favour of the acquisition of English by their children. English is the most useful language in the Island for entry into the Civil Service and Police; English is the language of the G-arrison and the Eleet; English is the language that best leads to employment in shops, in domestic ser-vice, and on merchant ships, where, in addition to other grades, a large number of Maltese stewards and stokers are employed. A knowledge of English is most desirable for any emigrants to the United States and to any parts of the British Empire, and Malta belongs to that Empire.
language and a better knowledge of the second language most useful to them in after life; and to a better knowledge of the three languages, Maltese, English, and Italian, by those who continue their studies in the secondary schools and the University and who have need of three languages. The present system is out of date and has been condemned as unsatisfactory by the best authorities.But its retention necessary in Secondary Schools and University.A reason for maintaining Italian in the secondary schools and the University is that, under present circumstances, in addition to the argument of culture, it is required in the profession of the law. With few exceptions, the existing records, deeds, wills, etc., from the time Latin gradually merged into Italian, are in the latter language. It would seem to be requisite that it should be taught in the secondary schools and the University, but not, as already enacted in the Constitution (Section 57), to the detriment of English.The interests of the children and the huge majority of the people should not be sacrificed to politics, but we would not force from England interference upon those who make professions of Italian culture, Italian affinity, and even Italian racial origin. Our irn-pression is that if the course we have suggested was followed the result would be the avoidance of discontent in the future, and also the avoidance of demands which might be much more far-reaching in effect, and not conducive to culture and education in the Island. We would particularly state that our recommendations in no sense connote any attack upon the Italian language, an answer in advance to objections which may be made.Imperial Authorities can make the Change.Language is a reserved subject, and, under the powers conferred by Section 68 of the Constitution for amending Section 57, the Im-perial authorities can exercise the power of amendment at any suitable time. The difficulty that arises in our minds is whether the present time is a suitable time for any change. We are not anxious that advantage should be taken of the present interregnum unreasonably to impose upon Malta a change which would be viewed by some people with dissatisfaction. The main and most im-portant principle of our Report is based upon the opinion that a further trial should be given to Parliamentary Government and that the Maltese ought to be able to govern themselves within the limits imposed upon them, and we do not desire to confuse this main re-commendation with the minor point of improvement in education.
1G7But Clearer Expression of Local Opinion may be advisable.It should also be noted that, as far as politics are concerned, the various Parties have not put the subject in the forefront of their programmes at times of elections to the Legislature, although more drastic proposals have been urged in the Press and at public meet-ings. Expressions of local opinion should not be overlooked and, before the Imperial Government exercise their reserved powers on the subject, it may be advisable that opinion upon it should be more clearly expressed in Malta. In weighing such expressions, it should be borne in mind that the question is one on which the two Houses of the Legislature may hold different views. Should they do so, it is desirable that the greatest weight should be given to the views of the Legislative Assembly. The point is to con-sider how far improved methods of education can be extended, and the time when such changes, whether with or without modi-fication of our suggestions, can or should be effected. The present system, established ten years ago by a majority of one vote, tends to become a hard and fast dogma, permitting no elasticity and no reasonable change.** Note by Count de Salis. In signing the Report I allow myself to make exception as follows with regard to the language question. i do so with much diffidence as the subject is wide, and a hard and fast expression of opinion might appear presumptuous when a study of the question has necessarily not been exhaustive.Although, according to the evidence put before us, the Maltese language, whatever its origin, is stated to be of great antiquity,. and although certain witnesses claiming to have knowledge have declared that it was this language which was not only spoken but even written in the time, of the Homans (in which case it has chronological precedence over most, if not all, European languages in their present form) it has been for centuries a spoken as opposed to a written language. Apart from the older Latin records, Italian has been in use for a very long time for nearly all purposes which involved writing, not only for legal business, but for more general requirements, up to the time of the seizure of the Island in 179S from the Knights of St. John, by the French. Since then efforts, not very continuous, have been made to establish Maltese as a written language, in evidence of which books were placed before us, a large proportion of them being due to the studies of the clergy. The output has been small, scarcely comparing to advantage with the bibliography of some of the little known Alpine tongues which concern populations very limited in numbers. In the circumstances it is not surprising that the written language has not yet become &quot; stabilized.&quot; One witness asserted that there were fifteen rival alphabets, and that even Arabic characters have been tried.Various documents were produced. Two may be examples of the extreme forms which might be used upon occasion.     One of them, a judgment[Continued on pane 130.
Continued from paye 129.]delivered by the High Court in Maltese, contained a low percentage of words which were not Italian.   It began:  &quot; II ICorti, Rat l&apos;eccezioni li issollevau 1&apos;accusati ta nullita ta l&apos;att tal accusations ...&quot;&quot; La Corte, Vista 1&apos;eccezione sollevata dagli accusati di nullita dell&apos; atto di accusations     . .   &quot;In the other, an eloquent patriotic address (without allusion to La Valette and the Knights) published in English, Italian and Maltese in the official Gazette of the 16th September, 1931, on the anniversary of the repulse of the Turks in 1565, there appear to be no words at all of Latin origin and the result is something very near Arabic. A sentence taken from the best effort in the peroration, such as &quot; Intom ilcoll ulied il-Cnisja Ommna Mkaddsa ....&quot;(&quot; You are all sons of our Holy Mother, the Church &quot;j requires practically no alteration to make it Arabic, except of course the spelling.Doubts may be expressed as to the extent to which either of these examples would be familiar to the countryfolk of Malta. In which direction is the sorely needed development of the language to take place, if it is to be raised from the level of a medium of daily intercourse to serve the increasing needs of modern education? Arabic is bound up in the expression of another faith and civilization, while the admixture of Italian with a Semitic language has its disadvantages, as shown in an instance put before us, where, in order to express in Maltese the idea of three-eighths tliet ottavi both sources had to be placed under contribution.It seems to me that the present system, as pursued in the Government schools, though there has been progress in recent times, is not giving satisfactory results and has in fact broken down. The strong claims that can be urged on behalf of all three languages lead to their getting in each other&apos;s way, but it is not easy to form a confident opinion as to the best remedy. My colleagues, who have great educational experience and have devoted much time and thought to the problem, are of opinion that Maltese and English alone should be taught in the elementary schools, Italian being reserved for secondary education, with the object that all three languages should ultimately be acquired, and more satisfactorily acquired, by those to whom they will be of benefit.In English and French schools an advanced education&quot; can be given in the mother tongue. For Malta the case is different. In the present undeveloped state of Maltese, assistance has to be invoked at an early age from other sources. What is the best solution in the case of children, whose capacity for learning tongues is that of an intelligent Mediterranean race? How far is the study of Maltese profitable and how soon should it give way to the study of two European languages which are both of great consequence to the Maltese? I feel hesitation in even suggesting an answer to these difficult questions, on which there were not unanimous opinions. Besides the views expressed by my colleagues, I note the programme of the Maltese Popular Party of 1921, in which provision was to be made for a variation of the teaching according to the needs of the pupils. The exeeu-tion of such a plan involves technical considerations, and especially that of expense, but it might seem well worthy of consideration. The tone of the programme was conciliatory in character.I would add that I am in entire agreement with my colleagues in regard to the view that all criminal proceedings should be conducted in such a way as to be easily understood by the accused.
1311CHAPTER X.-MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS.(A) &quot; Italianity.&quot;(B) The Press.(C) The Senate.(D) The University.(E) The Police.(A)  &quot; Italianity.&quot;The Attacks on the Nationalist Party.Having discussed the question of language, we think that we should refer to a subject with which it has a certain connexion, namely, alleged Italian affinities, which have been called by the name of &quot; Italianity &quot; and introduced into the political arena in an acute form. It is a fact that in publications concerning &quot; Italia irredenta &quot; Malta has been mentioned as having Italian affinities, like many other countries of the Mediterranean which have been so designated, including the Island of Corsica. So far as the Nationalist Party as a whole are alleged to belong to any such movement, we think that the accusation is incorrect. Resentment is naturally felt that, if it is desired to maintain the Italian language in certain sections of culture in the Island, the imputation of dis-disloyalty to Your Majesty is involved. The exaggeration of the theory has, we think, been pressed largely for political reasons and is unfair to the Nationalist Party as a whole. The exaggeration tends to provoke resistance, to create an Italian Party, and to cause disunion. It suggests that the people of Malta must be divided into loyal and disloyal subjects of the Crown, an imputation which we do not believe is justified.There may be a few persons who consider that, if the British chose to leave Malta, the Italians should be their successors; and also, with a view to the interest of other countries in North Africa, Malta may be looked upon, not by Italy only, as a useful and central place from which immigrants may be attracted. It was suggested to us that some Italian papers have published articles likely to cause bad feeling in Malta, but we doubt whether many of these articles reach the mass of the Maltese, or, so far as they do, whether they elicit anything beyond sceptical interest.
The Attacks on Dr. Enrico Mizzi.In point of fact, many of the attacks on &quot; Italianity &quot; in Malta are made against one individual, Dr. Enrico Mizzi, who is closely connected with the paper Malta, published in Italian, while the chief assailant of &quot; Italianity &quot; is another individual, Sir Augustus Bartolo. It does not appear that Dr. Enrico Mizzi has ever made any secret of the fact that under certain circumstances he would favour stronger connexion with Italy, but he has been, and may again serve as a Minister in Malta. Many of the attacks against him serve merely to provide material for newspaper articles or are provoked by the continuous pin-pricks which Dr. Mizzi himself possibly takes a sly delight in giving, particularly in view of the irritation which they have obviously been apt to produce. We mention this subject because so much has been made of it, and we consider that the accusation of disloyalty against the Nationalist Party is incorrect and largely founded upon rumour and surmise. We are not aware how far the Government of Italy, a great and friendly country closely allied to Great Britain in so many ways, may be cognizant of any activities in Malta, but, if any activities are undesirable, Your Majesty&apos;s Government would doubtless take any necessary steps in the matter.The Vatican&apos;s Denial.The Vatican has already denied any support of an Italian party in the Island. On 10th August, 1929, the Cardinal Secretary of State wrote : :The Holy See once more with the greatest emphasis repudiates Lord Strickland&apos;s false and malicious insinuation that its action was intended to favour the Italian Party in the Island. If such a Party exists there (which the Holy See does not know) certain it is that the Holy See in writing its letter to the Bishops had in view solely the religious interest of Catholicism in Malta, threatened and already seriously in-injured by Lord Strickland&apos;s attitude, interests which are very far from being in opposition to the rights of the British Crown in the Island.&quot;To this denial Your Majesty&apos;s Government replied :  &quot; Inasmuch as the representations which His Majesty&apos;s Government were compelled to address to the Holy See on the 5th August contained no allusion whatsoever to any state-ments made by the head of the Maltese Ministry, all references to such  statements appear to His Majesty&apos;s Government
irrelevant and inapplicable to the points at issue. They there-fore do not propose to express any opinion with regard to them, except to state that they learn with pleasure, but without surprise, that the Holy See has not acted in favour of any so-called Italian Party in Malta. It need hardly be said that no such allegation was made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in their representations of the 5th August.&quot;(B)  The Press.Increase in the number of Newspapers.It must be noted that with the improvement in the education of the people there has been a considerable extension of the number of newspapers, some of them more or less of the nature of broad-sheets, which have been published in the Islands. Undoubtedly the Press in general and particularly the very strong language which is used in certain of the newspapers and the personal attacks made upon individuals, both for their political actions and in their personal character, have had considerable influence in causing dis-turbance.Personal Attacks.Personalities are no new feature in the Press. When speaking of Malta in the House of Commons in 1900, Mr. Chamberlainsaid : &quot; There is one fact to be observed and it is a deplorable one. It is that the more educated and intelligent part of the population in Malta, including those gentlemen who have large stakes in the country, do not take part in elections and cannot be induced to present themselves as candidates for election. When they are asked to do so they object that the language of the local papers is so scurrilous and so personal that they are not prepared to face it.&quot;Mr. Chamberlain added :  &quot;I do not think that is any excuse. If we took the same attitude in England these benches would be empty.&quot;Malta is a small place, rumour spreads rapidly, innuendoes are repeated from mouth to mouth, and therefore personal attacks have greater influence than in England, where the law of libel has been more developed and defined.
The existing Newspapers and Periodicals.As the number of electors has increased, the political parties have found it to their interest to intensify propaganda by means of the Press, although many newspapers in the vernacular may be started for an occasion and only be alive for a few days or a few weeks, as was remarked by Dr. Enrico Mizzi, the Editor of the newspaper Malta, published in Italian. In addition to the Malta there are in Italian a commercial newspaper (with many advertise-ments in English), a literary review and some periodicals of minor importance. The papers in English are the Malta Chronicle (Con-stitutional). the Mid-Day Views (Nationalist), and the Herald. There is also a weekly paper in English, the Times of Malta. In the vernacular there are at present existing II Poplu, a Nationalist organ, though not official; Id-Dehen (Constitutional) and 11 Cotra (Labour); humorous papers; Id-Dawl (&quot; The Light &quot;), the organ of the Independent Labour Party, and weekly newspapers called 11 Progress (Constitutional), Lehen Is-Sewwa (&quot; The Voice of Truth&quot;), and the Malta Taghna (&quot;Our Malta&quot;). These appear to be the chief newspapers, although there are others of minor importance. There is, in addition, a monthly cultural review in Italian and English.The Church and the Press.The tone of some of the papers is particularly objected to by the clergy, and recently on two occasions papers have fallen suddenly under the ban of the Church. Owing to such action the publication of a paper called Ix-Xemx (&quot; The Sun &quot;) was discontinued on the 6th May, 1930. The weekly paper, II Progress, was then turned into a daily paper, in order to avoid the inevitable effect of unem-ployment and sudden stoppage which would have been otherwise involved, and a new weekly, II Berka (&quot; The Lightning &quot;) was produced. On 23rd October, 1930, 11 Progress was banned, and it was again made a weekly, and a new paper, Id-Dehen, was started. This paper subsequently appears to have given considerable offence to the Church.The Press Law.There is a Press Law in existence but it was stated to be ex-extremely difficult to enforce.   Lord Strickland said : &quot; In Malta there is still that Southern European feeling against being talked about, and it is very difficult to check the Press. I have made it a duty to try and find out how far the Press Laws are inefficient by bringing libel actions when-ever I could in order to test the law.   I have employed two
or three lawyers for years for the purpose. I very seldom get a conviction, and when I do it is very nominal. I was accused of having purchased Sizergh Castle with bribes obtained for setting up the electric light. I got  30 damages when the man was convicted of that. I had  8 recently, and  12 for the most atrocious libels, including that I was a Freemason &quot;.Lord Strickland agreed that this was not a very fruitful field, and said that he had had to pay the costs on both sides very frequently.We are not concerned in advising any further restrictions on the Press. So far as this matter is a domestic question it seems to us to be one for the people of Malta to determine, but we have thought it desirable to call attention to the criticisms which are made. It is not a minor factor in the affairs of the country.(C)  The Senate.The Suggestions of the Constitutional and Labour Parties.A suggested amendment to which we have had to give close consideration is that proposed in the constitution of the Senate.At present this constitution rests upon Section 5 of the Constitu-tion Letters Patent, which provides :  &quot; (1) The Senate shall consist of seventeen Members, that is to say, ten Members representative of the classes hereinafter specified (and hereinafter called the Special Members of the Senate), and seven Members (hereinafter called the General Members of the Senate) possessing such qualifications and elected by such persons in such manner and for such period as is hereinafter provided.(2) The Special Members of the Senate shall be : (a) Two Members representative of the Clergy, and nominated by the Archbishop of Malta;(6) Two Members representative of and elected by the Nobility;(c) Two Members representative of and elected by persons who hold any of the degrees of the University of Malta or some other University or have been authorized by the Maltese Government to exercise a profession (such constituency being hereinafter shortly referred to as &apos; The Graduates &apos;);(d) Two Members representative of and elected by the Chamber of Commerce ; i(e) Two Members representative of and elected by the Trade Union Council &quot;.
The Constitutional Party suggested that the ten Special Members should be reduced to five, the General Members increased to eight, and that four more members should be nominated by the Governor on the advice of the Executive Council as constituted after a general election. The Labour Party proposed that the Senate should be abolished altogether, and that if any revising body was to be established it should be of an entirely different character and have less power than the present Senate.Action by Imperial Authorities not Recommended.There may be much to be said for a reconsideration of the con-stitution of the Senate. The Maltese may eventually deal with this question themselves through the local Legislature. We do not think that an alteration should be imposed by Imperial authority. The demand for the change outlined above has come, we may remark, from one political party, and is apparently put forward because that party has not hitherto been sure of a majority in the Senate, and because on one occasion it was unable to pass its Appropriation Bill, a Bill involving a large sum of money and directed to the expenditure of a reserve fund accumulated by its predecessors in office. It would probably require an Act of the Imperial Parliament effectively to deal with the matter, and we are not prepared to advise that this course should be taken. Nor do we consider that there is sufficient reason for including this matter in any Act which might be passed to deal generally with the Constitution.The addition of four members to be nominated by the Governor on the advice of the Executive Council would invariably cause the Senate to be a mere reproduction of the Government of the day in authority and policy, and put the Senate at the disposal of the Ministers who happened to be in power.The powers of revision given to the Senate in the original Con-stitution have already been altered by Letters Patent issued in 1928, which were obtained upon the representation that the Con-stitution should be amended in such a way as to secure the supremacy of the Legislative Assembly in regard to Money Bills, and eventually went much further. A longer period of trial of the present amended system should, in our opinion, be given.The Special Members.These Letters Patent of 1928 have considerably altered the powers of the Senate. It is true that the special constituencies are rather artificial, particularly the Trade Union Council. The two members nominated by the Archbishop have apparently not been easy to select, and vacancies occurred for a considerable period.
Although the presence of these two Senators permits the inter-vention of the Church in politics, it must be remembered that the Roman Catholic Church is the Church of the Island and has been a power there from time immemorial. The Archbishop has always had something to do with the government of the Island, even in the time of the Knights, though it would appear that the Archbishop had no power to vote in their Councils. It might be difficult to reduce the clerical representatives in the Senate without similar action being taken with regard to the number of other representatives of special constituencies. The presence of members of the clergy in the Legislative Assembly is far more likely to cause attacks upon the Church, or, in so far as such attacks consist in heated remarks or retorts, upon the clerical representatives themselves, than their presence in the Senate as the nominees of the Archbishop.The representatives of the nobles form an element of continuity with the history of the past, and also their constituency contains some of the principal people in the Island. The representatives of the Chamber of Commerce are sent by a body which at the present time seems to have shed many of its principal members, owing to the particular political views of the majority of those who form it. We think that this is to be deprecated and regret that the principal merchants and commercial persons do not endeavour to take a greater share in the government of the Island.(D) The University.Although not advanced by political parties, some suggestions were made to us with regard to the position of the University of Malta. The suggestions were not laid before us in detail, and we did not embark upon any close examination of them as we con-sidered that the subject was not relevant to our inquiry.This decision must not be taken to imply that the University is not an important department in the life of the Island. It holds a very special place in the higher education of the young men of Malta, and has produced many distinguished students. It is the nursery of all those who follow the professions of the law and of medicine. It is specially sensitive to any supposed attack upon the Italian language, and possibly has been thereby led to decisions in favour of that language as the language in which professors should deliver lectures, which are certainly difficult to construe as in accordance with the Section of the Constitution which states that there shall be no restriction of the use of the English language.12458 k
Relation of the Government to the University.We would mention that, although the Government defrays the expenses of the University, it appears to have no voice whatever in deciding or assisting to decide any University -questions. Nor have the Minister for the Treasury or the Minister for Public Instruction any authority by themselves or by any authorized person to lay before the University authorities, by spoken argument, reasons for increasing or decreasing the grant to the University or schemes, for education. We offer no opinion whether any representatives of the Government should be entitled to develop any proposals involving expenditure or re-trenchment or to have a vote or not, but it would seem to us that in the interests of the Government and the University, this apparent absence of any correlation between expenditure and representation should be considered.Any alteration in the constitution of the University, or the methods by which it is conducted, in government, finance, and education, might be the subject of inquiry from time to time by a special Committee of the University itself or by a Committee appointed by the Maltese Government, or by a joint Committee, with a view to obtaining the best results and comparing so important an institution with the universities of other countries. The impression given to us by the statements made by various persons with whom we had interviews was that the University had not moved forward in the last ten years at a time when Malta has been rapidly changing and that it could not advisedly stand still and not adapt itself to new requirements of education. Malta is in a sense isolated and should jealously endeavour to maintain the reputation of its University in Europe for learning; and Europe is not concerned with local politics and any tendency of an University to be immersed in political disputes.(E) The Police.In connexion with the question of the administration of the Law in Malta, the subject of the police must necessarily not be ignored. Lord Strickland has inferred that the action of the Governor in abolishing boarding permits in connexion with the Father Micallef case indicated or was an encroachment by the other side of the Dyarchy and an attempt by the Governor to obtain control of the police. The Governor has absolutely denied that he had any intention of the kind.
172Alleged Political Interference.The control of the police was considered very seriously at the time of the grant of the Constitution in 1921, particularly as in the riots of 1919 the police force proved to be inadequate and Imperial forces had to be brought in. During the last ten years, also, the control of the police has occasionally been the subject of discussion particularly when Lord Strickland was Head of the Ministry and also Minister for Justice and in control of the police. Allegations have been made that at election time the police were made use of in favour of the meetings of one party to the detriment of the meetings of the other party, and that permission to hold meetings was arbitrarily given or withheld. It is obvious that any instability or uncertainty in the police force renders much more difficult the matter of dealing with any public disturbance, par-ticularly in view of the strong political feelings. It was suggested that a transfer of officers to another district by one political party for supposed adherence to another political party caused doubt and hesitation in the action of the police, and that even people in the streets threatened individual officers that they would be superseded upon a change of Government.In the course of the inquiry, the Chairman, in questioning a, witness to whose opinions weight must attach, remarked that the Commission had heard two different views on the police. One was that the Nationalists had been threatening, and that the people in the streets had been threatening, various police officers in such a way as to unbalance them. The threat was to the effect that their tenure of their positions was insecure and that they would be superseded by Nationalists. The other view was that Lord Strickland had been the Head of the Board of Police and that the police were in such terror of him that they would do anything to obey his orders and break up a Nationalist meeting while allowing a Constitutional meeting. The Chairman asked whether there was truth in either or both of those statements, and the reply given was that there was truth in both statements; and the witness had no hesitation in saying that both views were equally true.The Suggestions for Reform Submitted to the Commission.A suggestion was made that the police as a whole should be made.a reserved subject by an Imperial Act of Parliament. Another suggestion was that the distribution, strength, discipline, and grant of pensions should be reserved to the Imperial Government. If the Minister wanted to denude Valletta of the police force and send it to Notabile to maintain order at a meeting where he
anticipated disturbance, or to organize a disturbance, he could do so at present, but if distribution was a reserved matter the Governor could say that he wanted the police to remain in Valletta. The Governor would consult the Lieutenant-Governor or other per-manent officials. Such a proceeding would be useful to both parties, and all unprejudiced persons would approve of it, although it was admitted that it might have the effect of bringing in the Governor as an apparent partisan of one party or the other. A police Board under the chairmanship of the Lieutenant-Governor and including the Minister who was in charge of the police might be appointed to administer the force.Another witness said that the Ministers were responsible for the government on the civil side, and for the appiehension of criminals, keeping order in the streets, etc., and it would be difficult for them to exercise their responsible functions if the police were not under their control. Where there was a Legislature and Ministers it would be an extraordinary thing to divorce the police force from them. The position in Malta was unsatisfactory in many ways, but one method of solving the difficult)&apos; would be to give the Commissioner of Police and probably all commissioned officers of the police force stability of tenure, which would give greater sense of independence and cause them to make fewer enemies. The trouble, so far as the police were concerned, had probably arisen because there had been a tendency on the part of each Government to transfer certain men and substitute others. A man appointed by the party in power was apt to be looked on by others as the creature of the party which appointed him. If the police officers were given an assured position, so long as they did their duty and carried out lawful orders, they would be more independent and not liable to be penalized for political reasons.We were also informed that police officers regarded their future as at the mercy of the whims of politicians. The condition of transfer to other Departments was now a usual one, having been inserted in all contracts since the beginning of self-government. Under self-government, any officer who offended a politician found himself transferred elsewhere. The Commissioner of Police dealt with promotions up to the rank of Sergeant-Major, but anything above that had to be approved by the Minister. If the police were made a reserved subject, the political influence in promotions would be removed.Alternatively, it was suggested that an Ordinance could be issued placing the Commissioner of Police on the same footing as the Judges of the Supreme Court or the Auditor-General, so as to render it impossible for him to be removed by the Ministry in power. It would not be satisfactory to put all the other police officers on that footing, because it might encourage them to appeal
173to the Governor against orders issued by the Commissioner of Police. It may be remarked that if by Ordinance the Commis-sioner was made irremovable except by the Governor, the political-party in power when Parliamentary government is resumed could refuse to pay the police or could remove them from his control or even repeal the Ordinance.It was also stated that great trouble and inconvenience to the police were caused by the delays experienced in dealing with cases in the Law Courts. Police witnesses had often to be brought into Valletta from their districts five or six times for one case, and the number of the police might possibly be reduced and economies effected in an indirect manner if the delays in the Courts could be diminished.There are 32 officers in the police force in Malta and about 680 other ranks. The total expenditure on the police force for the year 1930-31 was  81,132. The force is scattered all over the Island, and there are 50 men in Gozo with a superintendent and an inspector.At present there is a Maltese Commissioner of Police and also, in addition to the Maltese Commissioner, an English Commissioner appointed on a temporary basis to act as Director of police duties and as administrative head, with instructions to exercise general supervision over all activities in the force and to maintain a high standard of efficiency. Our own observation tends to the belief that the police force, in which some of the finest men in Malta are enrolled, has attained a good and efficient standard, and we understand that the two Commissioners of Police have worked in great harmony.The Remarks of the Indian Statutory Commission on the Police Problem.The Indian Statutory Commission, as shown by their Report published in May, 1930, Volume II, Sections 58 to 65, had to con-sider the subject of the police and it is evident that they found it to be a difficult one. The Commissioners stated that their opinion was reached &quot; after long and careful thought.&quot; They said that there is an almost universal consensus of opinion among the police chiefs in India that the impartiality of action of the police is due not only to the training and discipline of the force but to the ordinary policeman&apos;s knowledge that he will be supported in the due discharge of his duty and not be sacrificed to clamour or intrigue. If, for example, a policeman believed that his action in suppressing a riot would be differently judged according to the
community (or party) to which the Minister belonged, impartiality in police action would be destroyed.   The Report also states : &quot; The subject of police does not constitute a department in the same sense in which the subject matter of an education department, or a medical department, or a roads department, may be said to be departmental. Every branch of provincial government is involved; a reasonably efficient police adminis-tration is the condition under which all departments may operate; it is the atmosphere without which the departmental activities of the province cannot breathe. We feel sure that we shall be confirmed by experienced official opinion when we lay it down that Law and Order must be a provincial subject, whatever be the degree of supervising control which the Centre may exercise.&quot;An Efficient and Impartial Force essential.It is evident from the number of opinions that have been given and the statements made with regard to control and instability of tenure that the subject has exercised the minds of many people in Malta. It is of the highest importance to the well-being of the Island that the efficiency of the police should be maintained and that control should be effected with judgment and care. Insecurity of tenure, except for misconduct, cannot aid either the morale of the force or the recruitment of the best men. It is undesirable that the subject of the police should be made a factor in politics or that the police should be supposed not to be impartial. As the Indian Commissioners state, a reasonably efficient police administration is &quot; the atmosphere without which departmental activities . cannot breathe.&quot; The mere establishment of a Chief Commis-sioner with security of tenure in the same manner as that of a judge would not, we think, be sufficient to satisfy all the requirements of the police force. The disadvantage of placing the police under the Governor would be that it might very well lead to considerable friction between the two sides of the Dyarchy.Special Instructions to Governor suggested.It rests with the Maltese to show that the government of the Island can be carried on by the Maltese in the manner that was desired by the framers of the Constitution of 1921. We suggest that instructions should be given to the Governor that he should take special cognizance of the manner in which the department of the police is administered in the future, and of the effect of bad administration, if there should be bad administration, upon the
Island. In the event of reports being made by the Governor show-ing that there has been grave deterioration and. that the police have not been properly administered, the Imperial Government would have seriously to consider whether, in spite of the disadvantages, the police should be made a reserved subject or a drastic revision of the Constitution of 1921 take place with the establishment of a different system of government.CHAPTER XI. THE AMENDING LETTERS PATENT OF1928 AND 1930.Having considered the proposed amendments, we must advert to the present constitutional position in the Island. At the time when they were passed the Laws of 1929 were attacked as being invalid, and the Ordinance of the Governor legalizing them was itself considered to be invalid. In order that the King&apos;s Govern-ment might be carried on and, as has been stated, to cut the knot,, the Letters Patent and the Order in Council of 1930, legalizing the Ordinances and through them the Acts, were issued and have since been acted upon. Those Ordinances and Acts have been administered in many of the Courts. No action has been taken in law to impugn the authority of the Letters Patent of 1928 or 1930. When he was asked whether the question of illegality had been tried, Sir Ugo Mifsud replied : &quot; The question of illegality has not been tried. To try the illegality of an Act like this would have meant an enormous expenditure and loss of time &quot;. But he cited before us a memorandum which he had previously laid before the Colonial Office, in which it was contended that the Malta Constitution Amendment Letters Patent of 1930 were illegal, because they increased the reservations and because &quot; the principal dispositions of the Letters Patent cannot be revoked or altered in an indirect manner &quot;.The Letters Patent of 1928: The Question of Validity.As to the Letters Patent of 1928, the Chamber of Advocates sub-mitted a memorandum, supplemented &apos;by the evidence of Pro-professor E. C. Vassallo, Professor of Constitutional and International Law at Malta University&apos;. The argument was that the Letters Patent of 1921 granted the representative Legislature power to make laws with regard to all matters not expressly withheld from such Legislature and that what was not reserved was transferred to the local Legislature irrevocably, the Crown losing the right to revoke, alter, or amend it.    The Crown has conferred on the Maltese
Legislature the power to make laws, restricting the subject-matter of such laws with these words : &quot; With the following limitations, namely, that the said power to make Laws shall not extend to matters (hereinafter referred to as reserved matters) touching the public safety and defence of Empire and the general interests of Our subjects not resi-dent in Malta, and (without prejudice to such general limita-tion) shall not extend to the following matters in particular or any of them, namely   .   .   .   .&quot;Despatches from the Secretary of State of the 24th December, 1919, 28th May, 1920, and 9th April, 1921, were cited in support of this argument. That the Letters Patent of the 1st August, 1928, and of the 26th June, 1930, were both based on the assump-tion that the whole of Section 41 (1) is alterable by virtue of the prerogative : and Professor Vassallo alleged that this assumption was incorrect. He stated that the intention of the Letters Patent was clear and it was the intention, not the letter, that must be followed. He concluded that the despatch of 2nd August, 1928, where it was maintained that the Crown had the power to amend the provisions contained in the opening words of Section 41 (1), conferring on the Senate and the Legislative Assembly the power of making laws, and in Section 41 (6), conferring on them the power to alter the provisions of the Constitution, subject to certain exceptions and restrictions, was a wrong and misleading exposition of the provisions of the Letters Patent.It was further submitted that the object of the Letters Patent was to enable the Legislature to amend the provisions of the Constitution on a point which in no way concerned reserved matters, namely, by what majority the Legislature may exercise its fundamental right of altering those provisions of the Letters Patent which were not reserved, and that the prerogative was supposed to be used to enable the Legislature to exercise the power which already belong to it. A not dissimilar opinion with regard to the powers that could be exercised by Letters Patent was expressed by Dr. Carlo Mallia, Professor of Commercial Law in the University of Malta and formerly Minister for Justice.Validity not Contested in the Courts.The arguments in reference to the Letters Patent of 1928 which were adduced before us on behalf of the Chamber of Advocates were carefully considered, at the time of their issue, by the Colonial Office and were not accepted. The invalidity of the Letters Patent of 1928 was not suggested by the Chief Justice in his evidence.     The Letters Patent of 1928 have been in existence
175for more than three years and their validity has not been con-tested, as far as we are aware, in any Court of Law, and certainly not before any tribunal whose judgment would be final.The arguments and the interpretations given by the learned pro-lessors are, however, an indication of the general criticism of legal procedure adopted in Malta at the present time.The Scope of the Letters Patent of 1928.The Letters Patent of 1928 had a very narrow scope. The first suggestion was that the power of the Senate over Money Bills should be curtailed. That power was contained in Section 61, which was not a reserved section and could not be amended toy Letters Patent. If, however, the Legislature desired amendment, it could not be effected unless there was a two-thirds majority in each House, a majority not in the least likely to be obtained, and, in the event of disagreement and a joint sitting of the two Houses being held, a majority of not less than two-thirds of the total number of the members of the two Houses, whether present or not. The reserved powers of the Crown blocked the way and prevented any alteration of Section 61 of the Constitution, except under the stringent conditions of Section 41 (6). Mr. Amery decided to relax the reserved powers, to give away the right of insistence upon those conditions and to yield, as far as the Crown was concerned, a right of restriction which had been specially reserved to the Crown.This right of restriction was yielded only if and so far as the Maltese Legislature passed a particular law in particular terms affecting a particular section of the Constitution, and the permission extended no further. Any other alteration of the Constitution was to continue to be subject to the two-thirds restriction, and the permission itself was of no value unless the particular law was passed. If the law was passed, the alteration remained and became a part of the Constitution : if it was not passed, the Constitution remained unchanged.An amendment was therefore proposed to be made by Letters Patent to the reserved Section 41 (6), namely, that, if a Bill was passed by the Maltese Legislature in certain specified terms laid down in the Letters Patent, it could be passed by a bare majority and not be held up by the restriction to a two-thirds majority required in the reserved Section 41 (6). The Letters Patent gave power to the Legislature to substitute a few words with regard to the Senate for a few words already in Section 61 and was a concession on the part of the Crown authorizing the Legisla-ture to effect a change which otherwise the Crown might have
prevented it from making, and in fact did prevent it from making unless the change was eifected in a particular form of-words.-- -While this first concession about Money Bills was being con-sidered, an extension was decided.upon, and the second object of the Letters Patent of 1928 was that the proposed law to be passed by the Maltese Legislature might amend Section 42 (3) of the Constitution Letters Patent.There does not appear in the documents we have examined to have been any close consideration of the fact that such a con-cession altered the powers of the Senate, without the concurrence of that body. -The narrow purview of the Letters Patent was that, if and only if the Maltese Legislature passed a law in the terms laid down by the Letters Patent, carrying out the two objects of amending Section 61 and amending Section 42 (3), then, instead of being subject to the two-thirds majority required under the proviso of Section 42 (6) in the Constitution Letters Patent, the require-rnent should be relaxed for the purpose of amending those Sections, and a law might be passed by a bare majority in the Legislative Assembly and a bare majority in the Senate, or, if there was disagreement, by a bare majority at a joint sitting. The required law purports to have been. passed by the Legislature at the joint sitting in January, 1929, and thereby the Letters Patent are spent.On the 26th June, 1928, in forwarding the draft Letters Patent, Mr. Amery briefly summarized their intended scope in the following terms :&quot; (1) In order to pass a law in the terms laid down in the draft the Government in power would require a bare majority in the Legislative Assembly and a bare majority in the Senate or, failing the latter, a bare majority at a joint sitting of the two Houses.(2) When once such a law was passed the result would&apos;be as follows : (a) Under the amendment of Section 61 the present (or a future) Legislative Assembly would have complete power to override the Senate as regards Money Bills and the Government would not have to resort to a joint sitting of the two Houses. . ......(b) Under the amendment of Section 42 (3) the present (or a future) Government would be able to override the Senate as regards all ordinary Bills (i.e., Bills not amend-ing the Malta Constitution Letters Patent) by means of a bare majority at a joint sitting of the two Houses.
(3) When the above law had been passed the Amending Letters Patent would be spent and any future Government which wished to alter Sections 61 or 42 (3) as they would then stand, would require a two-thirds majority in each House as laid down in the existing proviso to Section 41 (6) of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent &quot;.For Further Amendments Section 41 (6) remains.By these means Sections 42 (3) and 61 have now been amended permanently, but Section 41 (6) as originally drawn remains for all new amendments of the Constitution, including further amendments of Sections 42 (3) and 61 as now amended. It cannot effectively be contended that, by reading Section 41 (6) and Section 42 together, any other Bill amending the Constitution, which normally has to be passed by a two-thirds majority in each House, can, in the event of disagree-ment, be passed by a bare majority at a joint sitting. If it was unreasonable that a Bill amending the Constitution which had been rejected by the Senate should be passed by a two-thirds majority at a joint sitting, a fortiori it is unreasonable that it should be passed by a bare majority at a joint sitting.There is a strong contrast between Bills amending the Constitu-tion and Bills of the ordinary type, such as a Bill amending the criminal law. A special position is given to measures amending the Constitution and they have to be passed by a two-thirds majority in each House. Therefore it is not reasonable to suppose that imme-diately after making that stipulation, the Constitution should go on to say that, assuming the Senate has not only not passed the Bill by a two-thirds majority but actually rejected it, the Ministry in power in the Legislative Assembly should be able to bring it forward again at a joint sitting. The maxim generalia specialibus non derogant applies to the relationship between Section 41 (6) and Section 42. The whole object of Section 42 is to facilitate the passing of ordinary legislation and to lessen the oppor-tunities of deadlock between the two Houses. The contrast is still more apparent since, in the first instance, the majority is a majority of the total number of members, both those who are present and those who are absent, while the amending clause simply refers to the number of members present.It might indeed have been possible to cause Section 42 (1) to read : &quot; If the Legislative Assembly passes any proposed law other than a law of the kind mentioned in Section 41 (6),&quot; but lawyers accustomed to the drafting and interpretation of Acts of Parlia-ment know that, when a definite decision is given in one section.
it is not, as a matter of practice, whittled almost entirely away in the very next section, and it could scarcely have seemed possible that the two sections could be supposed to clash.The Letters Patent and Order in Council of 1930.We have next to consider the Amending Letters Patent of 1930 and the Order in Council of the 26th June, 1930. By Clause 12 of the Letters Patent constituting the office of Governor and Com-mander-in-Chief of Malta, dated 14th April, 1921, the same date as that of the Letters Patent providing for the constitution of responsible Government in Malta, it was enacted :  &quot; The Governor may from time to time, by any Ordinance to be by him issued, make laws for the peace, order and good government of Malta with regard to matters reserved from the Legislature of the Island by the Malta Constitution Letters Patent, 1921, and therein defined as &apos; reserved matters &apos; . . . . Provided, nevertheless, that any such Ordinance or any part thereof may be disallowed by Us through one of Our Principal Secretaries of State, and shall cease to be of any force or effect as soon as the disallowance thereof shall be published by the Governor in the Island : Provided also that, nothing herein contained shall affect Our right by any Order in Council to make from time to time all such laws with regard to any such reserved matter as aforesaid as may appear to Us necessary for the peace, order and good government of Malta.&quot;The Letters Patent establishing the Constitution enacted in Section 41 that the Senate and Legislative Assembly could make laws, to be entitled &quot; Acts,&quot; for the peace, order, and good govern-ment of Malta, with the following limitations, namely,&quot; that the said power to make Laws shall not extend to matters (hereinafter referred to as reserved matters) touching the public safety and defence of Our Empire and the general interests of Our subjects not resident in Malta, and (without prejudice to such general limitation) shall not extend to the following matters in particular or any of them   .   .   .&quot;The Section then sets forth the special matters which are added to the general reservation, and by Sub-section (6) provides : &quot; A Law passed by the Senate and Legislative Assembly may repeal or alter any of the provisions of these Our Letters Patent, save those contained in this section, and all other provisions relating to reserved matters or Imperial property and interests, and those contained in   .   .   .   .&quot;
the particular Sections mentioned, with certain provisos as to the majority required for the repeal or alteration of any provisions of the Letters Patent which the Senate and Legislative Assembly were competent to make.The Effect of the Amending Letters Patent of 1930.The real effect of the Amending Letters Patent of 1930 was that they enlarged or defined the provisions with regard to reserved matters so as to cover practically all matters in Malta in a time of grave emergency in the Island. They dealt with a reserved matter and are so expressed that they connect up with the general words at the beginning of Section 41 of the Constitution Letters Patent, con-cerning reserved matters. They lay down that in time of grave emergency if the /Secretary of State says that there is such emergency the Letters Patent may be brought into force, where-upon &quot; all matters touching the general interests of Our subjects resident in Malta,&quot; etc., may be treated as reserved matters.On the proclamation of the Amending Letter-s Patent, the Order in Council which was issued simultaneously, was unnecessary, so far as it conferred legislative powers on the Governor, because the effect of converting all matters into reserved matters was to bring everything within the purview of those powers which the Governor already possessed under Clause 12 of the Governors Letters Patent. That Clause gave him power to legislate on reserved matters, and therefore, having already got power to legislate on reserved matters, he could, after the issue of the Amending Letters Patent, legislate for practically everything. The Letters Patent do not purport to deal with anything but reserved matters. They are based on Clause 12 of the Governors Letters Patent, and the general words in Section 41 of the Constitution of 1921, and on the authority of Section 68 of that Constitution.The Object of the Order in Council.The Order in Council was issued to make the position clear, and provision was made in it with regard to the executive government and the legislative powers. The legislative powers conferred on the Governor were made subject to the proviso that, in the exercise of the power and authority to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Malta, &quot; the Governor shall not make or issue any Ordinance repealing or altering any of the provisions of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent, 1921,  as
amended by subsequent Letters Patent which under Section 41 (6) of the said first-mentioned Letters Patent, can be repealed or altered only by the Senate and Legislative Assembly of Malta.&quot;It was also necessary to confirm the Governors Ordinances already passed. It may be doubtful whether the first of these Ordinances, suspending the election, was made in a state of grave emergency which could be said to menace &quot; the public safety and defence of Our Empire &quot; within the meaning of the Constitution Letters Patent as originally drawn; but by the Amending Letters Patent on which the Order was based words were added to explain &quot; grave emergency &quot; and to cover any crisis likely to touch &quot; the general interests of Our subjects resident in Malta and the pre-servation and continuance of peace, order, and good government therein in the event of such interests and such peace, order, and good government being endangered, or the carrying on of respon-sible Government . . . being prejudiced, by reason of any grave emergency which the Secretary of State shall be satisfied has arisen and continues to exist within the Island.&quot;The Order in Council does not itself directly validate the Acts; the Acts are not mentioned in it. The Order validated them in-directly, because it validated the Governors Ordinances which had been issued between the dissolution of the Legislature and the date when the Order in Council came into force. Among those Ordinances there was included the Ordinance validating a series of Acts of which the Electoral Law was one, the Act which was in question in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal in 1930.The Question of the Validity of the Electoral Act of 1929.These explanations would lead to the conclusion that the Letters Patent of 1928 and 1930 are within the power of the Crown and are valid documents which govern the present position in Malta, and that, by means of the Letters Patent of 1930 and the provisions of the Order in Council of even date, the Ordinances issued by the Governor were legally validated, one of which Ordinances validated certain Acts purporting to have been passed by the Legislature of Malta, including the Electoral Act of 1929. On this basis that Electoral Act would be a perfectly suitable Act under which the election might be continued or a new election held. Any opinion, however, which we may indicate is not that of a Court of Law or an overriding decision in any manner, and, in order to silence all doubts, a short Act of the Imperial Parliament might be the most effective method of placing matters upon a secure and un-assailable basis. In view, however, of the time that might elapse before an Act of the Imperial Parliament could be passed - and the importance of avoiding delay, it is desirable to consider what steps the Imperial Government could take under present circum-stances, to enable an election to be held on a secure basis.  -
CHAPTER XII.-THE NEXT ELECTION.Detailed Suggestions on Procedure.Continuance of 1930 Election Undesirable.With regard to the continuance of the election which was pend-ing, in view of the passing of time, the existence of new registers and the conditions under which it was started, we consider it more than undesirable that the election should be continued. Although a new election could be held under the Electoral Law of 1929, such a proceeding would not prevent objection to the election being taken after it had been completed, on the ground that the election was invalid unless an Act of the Imperial Parliament had been previously passed validating the Electoral Law. Under present circumstances, in the event of the Court of Appeal deciding that the election was invalid, all the members of the Legislature would thereupon lose their seats. It must be re-membered that the Electoral Law of 1929 was declared null and void by a decision of the Court of Appeal on the day before the issue of the Letters Patent and the Order in Council. The validity of the Order in Council validating the Ordinance which validated the Electoral Law was called in question by some of the witnesses who appeared before us. It was also stated that the invalidity of Letters Patent, Order in Council, and Ordinances was alleged in the pleadiugs for the defence in various actions, chiefly for libel, now pending before the Courts. Further, the Law contains several innovations which have never been before the electorate and have not hitherto been tried, such as compulsory voting, a pro-cedure to which several witnesses took strong exception, and against which we had many complaints in statements put before us. Some of its provisions may be both reasonable and suitable, and may be properly considered and adopted by any future Legislature in Malta, but they are not vital to the conduct of a new election.New Election should be on sound Legal Basis.According to the Court of Appeal, the validity might be called in question by any voter, even by a dummy put up in forma vauperis. An attempt might be made to carry a case right through to the Privy Council. A new Government coming into power would commence with the prospect of having .a complicated case to fight, the validity of all its laws subjected to doubt, and all the members of the Legislature being unseated.Legal argument and litigation on every conceivable point have hung like a dark cloud over Malta for some years, and it is very
desirable that, as a matter of policy, efforts should be made to clear it away at as early a date as possible, particularly as a very considerable time might elapse before the question of the validity of the constitution of the Legislature could be decided by Courts of Law.Law of 1929 should be Repealed by Ordinance.Such a state of affairs would be intolerable, and, whether the Act of 1929 is valid or not, we are strongly of opinion that the knot could best be cut by repealing it by Governors Ordinance as from the date of its enactment. Assuming the repealing Ordinance is invalid and the Act repealed is invalid, no harm is done. A piece of waste paper would have cancelled a piece of waste paper, but the effect of the repeal would be that the sus-pended election, for which the existing writs were issued in accord-ance with and on the strength of the Act of 1929, would be cancelled automatically.The Governor either has or has not the power to make valid Ordinances under the Order in Council of 1930. That power pur-ports to be derived from the authority to pass Ordinances given by the Order in Council and under the express saving in Section 4 (5) of the Order in Council, which states : Nothing contained in this Order shall extend to prevent the Governor from taking such steps as he may deem fit for the holding whilst the Order continues in operation of elec-tions to the Senate and Legislative Assembly of Malta.&quot;Under such circumstances there would rest with the Governor power to repeal the Act and the Act will be validly repealed. On the other hand, if the Order in Council could not legally give the Governor the power to make Ordinances, the same Order could not have validated Ordinances and, through them, laws which the Court of Appeal, prior to the issue of the Order, had declared to be null and void, and thus the Electoral Act of 1929 would be null and void.We should advise that a repeal of the Electoral Act of 1929 from the date of its enactment should be effected by an Ordin-ance, because, if a new Ordinance repealing the Electoral Act of 1929, from the date of its enactment, is not enacted, that Act is still on paper and no election can be held except under it. It should be got out of the way, whether it is a mere scrap of paper or not.Ordinance should revive Electoral Act of 1924.The effect of repealing the Act of 1929 from the date of its enactment might be that, as that Law contains a repeal of the
previous Act of 1924, the repeal of the repealing clause would automatically bring into existence the previous Law of 1924. It would, however, in our opinion be better to insert in the Ordinance a definite revival of the Electoral Law of 1924. An argument in favour of this view is that in England the Interpretation Act of 1889, Section 11 (1), states : &quot; Where an Act passed after the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, repeals a repealing enactment, it shall not be construed as reviving any enactment previously repealed, unless words are added reviving that enactment.&quot;The Interpretation Act of 1889 does not apply to Malta, but the principle is reasonable and might properly be adopted.An Ordinance as suggested would state that Act No. XXVI of 1929 is repealed as from the 16th August, 1929, and Act No. XIV of 1924, as amended by Act No. Ill and Act No. XXXI of 1927, is hereby re-enacted as from that date-.Although the repeal of the Act of 1929 would implicitly involve the cancellation of everything done thereunder, including the can-cancellation of writs of election of Trade Union Senators, electoral lists, etc., the Governor should be advised simultaneously with the repeal of the Act to cancel by proclamation all writs issued under the Law to be repealed and any elections held thereunder or any further stages of the election.The election of Special Members of the Senate is not governed by the Electoral Act but by the provisions of the Constitution. No return to the special constituencies had been made when the elections were suspended except for two representatives of the Trade Union Council. In this case the writ to the returning officers was issued on the 30th April, 1930, returnable on or before the 20th May. A. hasty return of Lord Strickland and Mr. Borg as representatives of the Trade Union Council was made on the even-ing of the 2nd May, the day before the elections were suspended. It is in the power of Your Majesty to dissolve the Legislature at any time after it has met, and it is, we think, inherent in this power of dissolution to prevent the meeting of the Legislature provided a new election takes place.Revision of the Register Required.With regard to the electoral lists, if the Electoral Law of 1929 is repealed and the Law of 1924 revived as from the date of its enactment, all the electoral lists issued since 1924 will automatically lapse, but the work which has been done on them and the revision up to date will be in existence.   Under the 1924 Act the lists were1245s l
previous Act of 1924, the repeal of the repealing clause would automatically bring into existence the previous Law of 1924. It would, however, in our opinion be better to insert in the Ordinance a definite revival of the Electoral Law of 1924. An argument in favour of this view is that in England the Interpretation Act of 1889, Section 11 (1), states : &quot; Where an Act passed after the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, repeals a repealing enactment, it shall not be construed as reviving any enactment previously repealed, unless words are added reviving that enactment.&quot;The Interpretation Act of 18S9 does not apply to Malta, but the principle is reasonable and might properly be adopted.An Ordinance as suggested would state that Act No. XXVI of 1929 is repealed as from the 16th August, 1929, and Act No. XIV of 1924, as amended by Act No. Ill and Act No. XXXI of 1927, is hereby re-enacted as from that date;Although the repeal of the Act of 1929 would implicitly involve the cancellation of everything done thereunder, including the can-cancellation of writs of election of Trade Union Senators, electoral lists, etc., the Governor should be advised simultaneously with the repeal of the Act to cancel by proclamation all writs issued under the Law to be repealed and any elections held thereunder or any further stages of the election.The election of Special Members of the Senate is not governed by the Electoral Act but by the provisions of the Constitution. No return to the special constituencies had been made when the elections were suspended except for two representatives of the Trade Union Council. In this case the writ to the returning officers was issued on the 30th April, 1930, returnable on or before the 20th May. A hasty return of Lord Strickland and Mr. Borg as representatives of the Trade Union Council was made on the even-ing of the 2nd May, the day before the elections were suspended. It is in the power of Your Majesty to dissolve the Legislature at any time after it has met, and it is, we think, inherent in this power of dissolution to prevent the meeting of the Legislature provided a new election takes place.Revision of the Register Required.With regard to the electoral lists, if the Electoral Law of 1929 is repealed and the Law of 1924 revived as from the date of its enactment, all the electoral lists issued since 1924 will automatically lapse, but the work which has been done on them and the revision up to date will be in existence.   Under the 1924 Act the lists were1245s l
made by the magistrates, instead of by the Principal Electoral Registrar. No election could take place on the old list of 1924; it would have to be brought up to date. We are informed, how-ever, that such procedure would be almost a formality. A new list of returning officers would be published. A Permanent Electoral Officer and two Revising Magistrates for Malta and one for Gozo would be appointed, for the compilation and revision of the lists, in accordance with the Electoral Law of 1924 as subsequently amended. It would take about a month to bring the old register up to date under the authority of the magistrates. The magistrates would receive instructions, as an executive act, that as a first step they would have to publish the lists as revised up to date and invite anybody interested to impugn those lists or to add or cancel names. It would merely be a series of executive acts, done in Malta by officials perfectly capable and fully cognizant of the proper legal steps required to be taken.When the date of the election is definitely decided, Ordinance No. I of 1930 would have to be repealed, inasmuch as that Law merely suspends the further stages of the election which was started under an Act which will be repealed. The election would then be held under the 1924 Act.Constitution of a Trade Union Council.As regards the recognition of the Trade Union Council for the purposes of this election, the Governor should act independently of the Malta Trade Union Council Act (Act XXII of 1929) and of the Act regulating Trade Unions (Act XXI of 1929). The Nationalists did not register under Act XXI of 1929, because they did not recognize the validity of that Act or of Government Notice No. 143 of 1930 appointing the persons elected by the Unions under the Act. The Governor would publish a Notice recognizing such Trade Unions as he thought fit, which he has power to do under the Constitution of 1921. It may be observed that in a recent Government Notice (No. 173 of 1931), in virtue of which the election of the Trade Union Council as made by the local Trade Unions was published, a proviso is contained reserving the right of the Governor to recognize any Trade Union Council for the purposes of the Constitution Letters Patent of 1921.Services of Ministers should be dispensed with.Some time pi-ior to the election taking place, the services of Ministers should be dispensed with as an executive act under the ordinary provisions of the Constitution, because they hold office
during pleasure. On ceasing to be Ministers they would ipso facto cease to be members of the Executive Council. The definition of the Executive Council, according to the Constitution, is that it shall be a body composed of &quot; such persons, being Ministers, as the Governor shall .... appoint &quot;, and if they cease to be Ministers they cannot be members of the Executive Council.We do not consider that a dissolution of the present Legislature, so far as it has been constituted, is the right course to take. It might be contended that after a dissolution Ministers would con-tinue in office and would conduct the elections. While, on the one hand, the Constitution says Ministers cease to be Ministers if they cease to be members of the Legislature, on the other hand, the Order in Council issued under the Letters Patent says that the Executive. Council as at present constituted shall continue to exist; and under this Order the mere fact that these persons are members of the Executive Council makes them Ministers. A dissolution would only be an ingenious method of keeping present Ministers in their place as Ministers. The Order in Council itself expressly provides that nothing in the Order shall affect the constitution of the Executive Council, and that Executive Council, according to the Constitution of 1921, is an assembly of &quot; such persons, being&apos;Ministers, as the Governor.....shall appoint &quot;.   If the ser-vices of the Ministers are dispensed with, they cease simultaneously to be Ministers and to be members of the Executive Council.The difficulty of Ministers continuing to be members of the Executive Council ought to be and can be avoided, in view of the fact that the Governor can dispense with the services of Ministers at any time. We lay particular stress upon this recommendation that the Governor should dispense with the services of Ministers.Order in Council of June, 1930, to be taken out of Operation.As soon as the election is in train, in accordance with the pro-cedure under the Act of 1924, or, more suitably, immediately after the election has been held, the Order in Council of the 26th June, 1930, must be taken out of operation. The Constitution would be restored by this action. The provision in Section (6) of the Order in Council states that the Order shall continue in operation in Malta &quot; until the Governor shall by proclamation in the Gazette declare that it has ceased to be in operation therein and he shall in any event issue such a proclamation not later than one week after the complete results of the next election to be held in Malta as aforesaid have been ascertained and declared&apos;&apos;. We think that the Governor should issue a proclamation as soon as the com-plete results have been ascertained and declared.
Validation of Existing Laws by New Government.After the election has taken place, the first act of a new Govern-ment will necessarily be to validate the existing Laws or to repeal them, saving what has been done thereunder up to the time of the repeal. This course, supported by innumerable precedents, would have to be taken as a practical necessity, because no Govern-ment could avail itself of the Appropriation Laws unless its first act was to validate the Laws or to repeal them, saving what had been done up to the time of repeal. Some of the Laws have become part of the common life of the people; the Courts have been giving expression to them Laws such as that relating to the Notarial Profession and Archives, the Urban Pent Regulation Act and the Small Dwelling Acquisition Act. The position would become chaotic in the event of any real difficulty occurring, and an Act of the Imperial Parliament would in such circumstances be at once required to validate them all.Any Government must respect the law under which the life of the Island has been carried on; it could not arrange that all the taxes paid should be given back and that all the contracts made should be null and void. In addition, the Government would avoid the hampering effects of litigation impugning the validity of any of the Ordinances, such as Ordinance No. V, against which criticism has been openly directed. By the lawful repeal of an invalid Law the same effect is obtained as by successfully impugning it before a Court of Law.We would lay particular stress upon this re-introduction of the Electoral Law of 1924, in view of the fact that our terms of reference stated that we were to consider the existing political situation in the Island and make such recommendations as might seem desirable as to the steps which should be taken to deal with it, in addition to the special reference as to the possibility of re-establishing con-stitutkxual government. We have already said that we consider the&apos; possibility to exist, and also the advisability. The above pro-posal as to the election is one of the steps which, in our opinion, it would be desirable to take. .Election should not be Postponed through Fear of Disturbance.As has been stated, the elections of 1930 were suspended on the ground of emergency. That emergency arose from the alleged danger of riots and turmoil, which caused the Governor to consider that his powers under the Letters Patent of 1921 should be brought into force.   Some witnesses before us agreed with this opinion,
and others said that there was no risk of disturbance and that no serious disturbance would have taken place. One witness remarked that &quot; everybody in Malta in those days laughed at the grotesque joke that had thus been cracked by Lord Strickland in playing on the good faith or using the complicity of the Imperial side of the Dyarchy. The danger to public safety was a mere fabrication &quot;. Another witness said there was &quot; no semblance of disorder&quot; and that the notice that the election was suspended on account of feared disorders was received &quot; with feelings more akin to bitter derision than anything else.&quot;It is not possible for us justly to estimate the value of these two opinions after so many months, or the conditions in which the Island was at the time of the suspension of the elections. The elections in Malta are in no case likely to be conducted without fervour and without disturbances, such as may sometimes occur in various constituencies in Great Britain. There were special factors in the issue of the Pastoral Letter immediately before the time fixed for holding the elections, in the alleged trouble that had been caused by gangs of paid men attending meetings in order to break them up, in the difficulties felt by the police in coping with in-creasing unrest, in the apprehension of the Imperial authorities that the events of 1919 might be repeated, and in rumours of an inten-tion to cause disturbance, which was indicated to us in camera and no doubt had a considerable effect in causing the decision. The feeling in the Island may possibly be instanced by the behaviour of the crowd and the danger of the Archbishop&apos;s palace being attacked, which was described to us by one of the witnesses, Mr. P. W. Salomone, after an attempt had been made to shoot Lord Strick-laud by a man who is now, we understand, in an asylum. We can-not say that this state of emergency and these factors exist at the present time. Some have certainly been removed. We under-stand, from the opinion of several witnesses, that the efficiency of the police has been greatly improved and that they could deal with meetings and any attempted disturbances in any election which may be held. We have in any case come to the definite conclusion that the risk of trouble should not cause the restora-tion of Parliamentary government to be deferred.There should be no difficulty between the two sides of the Dyarchy with reference to an election. The Governor will have some executive acts to perform, if our opinion is followed, in initiating an election under the Act of 1924, as revised in 1927, in which he will have the assistance of able officials, and in making selections for the Trade Union Council. The Governor has already expressed in public his desire to do all that he can in favour of the restoration of self-government, and no action that we can think of need lead to friction between the two interests.   The duty of
the Governor will be practically that of an executive officer in-structing officials to take the necessary steps for the conduct of the election. His other executive acts will necessarily be to see that the officers conducting the election are not all adherents of one party and will act fairly in taking the votes, particularly of those who are illiterate, and to see that the police use their best en-deavours to ensure a peaceful election and do not give preferential treatment to one side or the other with regard to the holding of meetings. It should be noted that the police appear to be far more efficient now than they were at the last proposed election, and we have little doubt that, under the Governors general supervision, they will be able to keep order. It is of particular importance that order should be kept, since, as we have said, the Maltese should justify their desire for self-government by showing that they are capable of it.The Governor has the advantage of having recently arrived in the Island. He has no preference for one party or another, and he also has the advantage of not having had a Government on the advice of whose Ministers he had to act. The position might be more difficult if the late Governor, Sir John Du Cane, was still in office. Circumstances led to criticism of Sir John Du Cane and suggestions that the Imperial Government, on his initiative-tive, had been intervening unduly in the affairs of Malta. We do not think that this criticism of the late Governor is well founded. For a time he followed to a certain extent the advice that respon-sible Ministers gave to him, but he found that those very Ministers alleged that he was endeavouring to obtain control of the police and inter-fering with the other side of the Dyarchy, and at the end of his period of office many small criticisms of this character were levelled against him. His desire was to benefit Malta, and many works which he accomplished outside politics will bear fruit in the future or be the origin of improvements in Malta which the Maltese at present do not realize. His task was very difficult and was not made easier by the action of Ministers.The Imperial Government did not give self-government to Malta with the intention of infringing upon it or of resum-ing the government for itself. The principal idea under-lying the Letters Patent of 1921 appears to be that the Imperial Government should retain a really substantial supremacy over the power to legislate and should have the right to intervene if and when, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, the major interests of the Empire are involved, since those interests transcended the interest of the Island in having the manage-ment of its own affiairs. It was intended that the Island should manage its own affairs and that no interference should take place
182provided the Government of the Island did not seek to impinge upon the reserved rights of the Imperial Government. If the Imperial Government appeared to infringe, the Maltese Government could object, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the question could be settled, for the simple reason that the Imperial Gov-ernment desired that the rights of both parties should, as far as possible, be defined and that the Maltese should govern them-selves. If the Maltese Government appeared to infringe, the Imperial Government could object and, in the last resort, make use of its reserved powers.We are of opinion that during the last four years the action of the Imperial Government has been attacked, and renewed objections advanced by the Maltese Government, which may have prevented the late Governor from continuing to give constitutional support to the Ministry in power, as at the beginning of his term of office he would naturally think it advisable and proper to do.If the Constitution is restored, the self-government of Malta is an assured fact, provided the Maltese Government keeps within its firnctions and does not seek to quarrel with the Imperial Gov-ernment, and provided individuals do not seek to gain power at the expense of the Imperial Government and recognize the fact that the Imperial Government does not desire, to infringe the self-government of the Maltese.Further Reason for Dispensing with Services of Ministers.We have already expressed our view that the services of Ministers should be dispensed with and the Constitution be restored. For a long time Ministers have held a quite anomalous position. Any-thing that they did to conduct the election would be construed as unfair and as preventing the free expression of the views of the electors, and it would doubtless be considered that the Imperial Government retained them in power for its own purposes and not for the advantage of Malta. In their own interests, therefore, and in the interests of the people of Malta, we strongly advise that the services of Ministers should he dispensed with.CHAPTER XIII.-THE CHURCH.The further question with regard to the Church is more difficult. It was considered by Your Majesty&apos;s Government, as indicated by the communications which passed between Your Majesty&apos;s Gpv-ernment and the Vatican, that the chief source of the trouble in
Malta was the interference of the clergy in politics, and a request was made that the clergy should be ordered to take no part in the politics of the Island.Special Position of the Church viewed historically.In considering this subject, it is necessary in some measure to consider the history of the past. For many centuries Malta has been pre-eminently a Roman Catholic country. The Knights of St. John, on their expulsion from Rhodes, were granted the Island by the Emperor Charles V, on the express condition that they should oppose the Turks; and, by their action in the Mediterranean and their defence of the Island, they caused the Turks at an early date to object strongly to their presence. Their continuous warfare also hindered the Turks from other enterprises against Christendom. The interpretation of the Knights that they were the Church Militant fighting in defence of Christendom proved on occasion contrary to the desires, particularly of France and Venice, for peace and trade with the dominions of the Sultan. At a later date, their efforts became directed to attacks against the rulers of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers, and the pirates of the Mediterranean generally. During all this time the Knights, so far as they were representative of the Church, the Inquisitor, so far as he was the representative of Home, and the Archbishops, so far as they were admitted to the Councils of the Knights, although they were not allowed to vote, all represented in different degrees what, in modern parlance, would be called &quot; interference of priests in politics &quot;.When the Knights fell, the principal objections of the Maltese to French rule were caused by the attacks upon the clergy and the seizure of the treasures of the churches. It was largely due to the action of the clergy in 179S and in subsequent years that the people of Malta were roused to support the entry of the English Govern-ment and the establishment of British rule in the Islands. At the time when the British Government began to exercise authority in the Islands, several declarations were made to the people of Malta in regard to the security of their religion, and these declara-tions were repeated at later dates.The Tradition of Clerical Participation in Politics.The clergy continued for a century to have a voice in the Gov-ernment. In 1921 the action of the clergy aided in forming political parties. When the Constitution was established in 1921 a large number of clergy were desirous of entering the Legislature at the
183first election. In addition to the two special representatives of the clergy in the Senate, seven ecclesiastics became members of the Legislature. At the election of 1924, besides the two special representatives, three other ecclesiastics were returned. After the election of 1927 there was a long period when no representa-tives of the clergy sat in the Senate and there were only two ecclesiastics in the Legislature. This latter number was after-wards reduced to one, Mgr. Dandria, a principal member of the Nationalist Party.Policy of the Present Archbishop.The policy of the present Archbishop has evidently been to reduce the number of clergy who should receive his permission to sit in the Legislature, although it might be difficult for him to refuse permission to the single ecclesiastic lately in the Legislative Assembly, owing to the probability that such an action would be interpreted as showing bias against the Nationalist Party.Friction in the past has been attributed to the presence of the clergy in the Senate and Legislative Assembly, and to the free criticism to which they have been subjected. Such criticism seems to be the inevitable result of their membership of the Legislature and will no doubt continue in future. If it were practicable, an arrangement whereby the clergy would cease to enter the Legis-lature would remove opportunities of controversy. We have reason to believe that the Archbishop himself has discountenanced the candidature of the clergy at elections, but that is a different pro-position to his being ordered not to allow the clergy to exercise electoral rights and enter the political arena.Reasons for Representation of Clergy in the Legislature.The Archbishop&apos;s representatives in the Senate may possibly have some analogy to the Bishops in the British House of Lords, where in a measure the Bishops can protect Church interests. Bepresenta-tion may become important in Malta, in the event of objection being taken to special legislation affecting the Church. We do not think we are going beyond the restrictions attached to in camera evidence in remarking that the Bishops freely admitted that ex-propriation of land would not be objected to provided that com-pensation was paid, and provided that it was not expropriation directed only against the Church. The desire may well exist that the Church should have an opportunity to defend herself on the subject of property, particularly in view of old-standing leases fall-ing in at a comparatively early date in the surroundings of Valletta, and should have spokesmen through whom explanations can be given, in the same way as the Bishops in the House of Lords are
able to explain the meaning and objects of Church assemblies in England. A representative Government has been established, and not only acquiesced in but actually promoted by members of the hierarchy in Malta, with a view that in a Roman Catholic country the people should be governed by such Roman Catholics as they desired.Tire economic position of Malta may become serious. The absence of emigration and indeed the return of emigrants, and the continuous increase of population is undoubtedly causing in-creased financial stringency. Malta suffers from the depreciation of the value of its currency in relation to the countries from which it has been accustomed to draw its supplies and its food. It is not supplying, and could not within a short time supply, its own necessities. &quot; Cuts &quot; in the Services both in personnel and in pay, the reduction of the number of employees in the dockyards and elsewhere, the decreased employment of whole sections of men, such as the boatmen or dghaisa men, all present difficulties, which the Legislature will have to meet.These very difficult problems which the Legislature must immediately face are bound directly or indirectly to affect the Church. Although as we have indicated the presence of clergy in the Legislature gives opportunity for controversy, we do not think we can advise any action at the present juncture for the entire exclusion of the Church from representation in the Legis-lature and the advantage of being able to express opinions upon questions of taxation.Participation outside the Legislature.It is not, however, only in the Legislature that priests can inter-vene in politics. In the Pastoral which he issued on the occasion of the 1924 election the Archbishop laid down rules regarding the general participation of the clergy in politics. Ecclesiastics having the care of souls were forbidden publicly to take sides in favour of this or that political party and to take an active part at meetings and political gatherings. Other members of the clergy were warmly exhorted to conform to this line of conduct. At the time of the election of 1927 the clergy were reminded by Instructions of the Archbishop, dated the 22nd July of that year, that they must abstain from frequenting clubs that were pronouncedly political and from taking part publicly at meetings and making propaganda.Pronouncements on these lines by the Archbishop at the time of an election are clearly unexceptional, and appear to be well calcu-lated to forestall partisan intervention by which the clergy might exercise their great influence on behalf of any merely political
interest. Until the dispute between the Ministry and the Bishops in connexion with the voting of the Appropriation Bill in 1928, no agitation on the subject of the intervention of priests in politics had, as far as we are aware, been raised. The Pastoral of 1930 was issued in circumstances in which the Bishops maintained that the rights and discipline of the Church had been attacked. It strictly forbade priests to administer the Sacraments to those who refused to obey instructions not to vote for Lord Strickland and his candidates, or even those &quot; of other parties, who in the past have helped and supported him in his fight against the rights and the discipline of the Church, or who propose to help and support him in the coming elections &quot;. The Constitutional and Labour Parties had supported Lord Strickland in the last Government and were fighting the 1930 election under his leadership and, although no party was mentioned by name in the Pastoral, its effect was, obviously, to limit electors who obeyed its instructions to voting for the Nationalist candidates.The events which followed the publication of this Pastoral and the view taken by the British Government, as then existing, with regard to it and its probable effect upon an election have already been sufficiently described.It would seem that the course of events had led the Bishops and, through them, the clergy to believe that every action of Lord Strickland^ party could be mainly attributed to Lord Strickland as its representative. That party has never put forward in its jirogramme a policy of confiscation or of opposition to the Church, and, with regard to confiscation, Lord Strickland has expressly stated that he would not support any such policy. Lord Strick-land also stated in public that he was prepared to make an apology, and that such apology, he presumed, would be for any heated words that he might have used in debate in the Legislature and that might&apos; be interpreted as being anti-clerical or an attack upon the clergy. One difficulty undoubtedly is that it is not easy to define what is an attack upon the clergy, and some statements to which an ordinary reader would not pay very much attention have been interpreted as such. It was admitted by witnesses, both clerical and lay, that if a priest entered into politics he must expect to be attacked in answer to attacks, the difficulty being to separate criticism of the individual from criticism of the clergy generally and to differentiate the action of an individual priest in his clerical capacity from the action of the priest in his political capacity.The Next Pastoral.We have gained the impression that the Archbishop does not quarrel with the programme of the Constitutional Party but with
the methods of the individuals leading the party, and the corre-spondence we have quoted shows that he acted according to his conscience at the time when the Pastoral was issued. That Pastoral was issued in very special circumstances and is now obsolete, although it has not been withdrawn. A Pastoral has been issued before each election, and therefore it is to be presumed that a new Pastoral will be issued before any election takes place.The Bishops are of course in a position to address themselves with the authority of then office to the local clergy. Their pronounce-ments must necessarily carry great weight, but would gain immeasurably in importance from any express ratification by the Vatican, which would definitely enable them to speak to their clergy in the interest of peace. To obtain that peace without the local or general discussions, not successful in the past and certain to take a longer time than we would desire before an election is held, it is more than advisable that an election should take place without pronouncements on the one side attacking the action taken by the clergy and, on the other side, without any Pastoral or Instructions enjoining other principles than those of peace and good-will, and that both parties should do their utmost to obtain similar action on the part of their followers.We are not in a position to do more than tender advice, but we would suggest that, if such advice, which we cannot but think to be reasonable under the circumstances, is not taken, any responsibility must be attributed to those who are unwilling to accept it and prefer a policy of continued dispute. We may possibly be permitted to suggest that the old Italian proverb, &quot; he cose lunglie diventano serpi&quot; (&quot; Protracted disputes breed serpents &quot;), is not inapposite to the present situation.If an election takes place in peace, there can be no reason why further difficulties, if any, should not be considered between the Imperial G-overnment and the Vatican. As long as no conversations take place between the parties, no lasting or satisfactory settlement is possible, but we would venture to suggest that the stipulation of prior conditions will tend to make negotiations difficult.We have a belief, formed after the most earnest inquiry, that a Pastoral by the Bishops will be quite different in tone from the Pastoral of 1930. This belief has been one of the main con-siderations which have influenced us in recommending that a new election should be held.We cannot express too strongly our conviction upon this subject. It is founded upon long and friendly conversations with the Bishops and upon the desires expressed by Your Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment and the Holy See for good relations with one . another and for peace in Malta.
In spite of arguments upon details, we think that the real exist-ence of such desires may be clearly deduced from the diplomatic correspondence between Your Majesty&apos;s Government.and the Holy See.We feel that the next Pastoral will be framed in the interests of peace and goodwill, particularly in a matter of such world-wide interest, far transcending the comparatively minor interests of Malta and involving the interests of a great Empire and of the Roman Catholic Church in all quarters of the world.CHAPTER XIV.-SUMMARY OF SUGGESTIONS AND OF MAIN RECOMMENDATION.In the previous Chapters we have indicated that our main recom-mendation is that : A. The services of Ministers should be dispensed with.B. The Constitution should be restored.C. An election should take place at an early date.We have in addition referred to matters with regard to which changes might be made. Some of these suggested changes are of quite a small character. It may be convenient to group these suggestions according to the method of legislation which would be required to give effect to them : -I. By Ordinance of the Governor.A change which we consider would be very valuable would be the adoption of such parts of the Report of the Committee of Maltese- lawyers upon the procedure in the Law Courts as may commend themselves to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, though we would suggest that the lower Courts should have juris-diction over cases which involve a somewhat larger sum than that which the Committee have fixed. This change proposed by the Maltese Committee we think would be of considerable advantage if adopted by the Governor and would not entail any alteration of the Constitution under the restriction imposed by the Order in Council. We consider that it should be effected by the enactment of an Ordinance by the Governor before the Constitution is restored. After the Constitution is restored any advisable amendments could be made by the Maltese Legislature.II. By Letters Patent.(1) As soon as it may be convenient to issue Letters Patent, there should be inserted in them, under the powers of Section 68
of the Letters Patent of 192L a revision of Schedule A, annexed to Section 63, making the sum allotted to the Judges, under the heading &quot; Other Services &quot;,  5,500.(2) In the same Letters Patent, under the powers of Section 68, Section 57 of the Letters Patent of 1921 should be altered so that trials in Criminal Courts shall be conducted throughout, with the exception of entries in the notarial register, in English or Maltese respectively, in cases where the accused persons are of British or Maltese origin, and, in cases where both British and Maltese are jointly accused, in both English and Maltese, with the proviso that when the cases are tried in English the jury should be able to understand the English language.(3) If and when the Secretary of State for the Colonies is satis-fied that sufficient expression of opinion is given in support of an alteration in tlie elementary schools and that there is a desire on the part of the people in the Island for an alteration, we consider that, under the powers of Section 68, the terms of Section 57 should be so altered as to allow of a change in the method of teach-ing in the elementary schools and the requirements for proceeding to the secondary schools. The manner in which this should be accomplished is, in the opinion of two of us, an amendment making English the extra language to be taught in addition to the native Maltese in the elementary schools and to be the extra language necessary for children proceeding to the secondary schools, with the provision that Italian should be taught to children as soon as they have entered the secondary schools, with a view to the acquirement of a third language and enabling those children who intend to enter professions to have the advantage of a wider educational scope, and to pass examinations for the law and medicine.III. By Act of the Imperial Parliament.There are certain other changes which, if imposed by the Imperial authorities, could constitutionally only be effected by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. If it should be thought desirable and feasible at an early date to introduce such a measure, the following changes might, in our opinion, advisedly be made :  (1) Eor future elections we have made, in Chapter VII, suggestions for placing the Trade Union Council on a better basis. If an Act of Parliament should be decided on a clause might be inserted providing for the autonomy of the Trade Union Council on the lines mentioned in that Chapter.
(2) The provision of the Letters Latent of 1921 that the Judges are to be appointed by the Governor in Council should be amended, so that the appointment of Judges may be made a reserved matter and taken out of the province of the Maltese Ministry. The persons appointed to be Judges should have had at least twelve years&apos; experience either as Counsel or on the Magisterial bench. These appointments should not neces-sarily be confined to men educated at the University of Malta or to Maltese by birth. Although a wider field of selection might not be drawn upon, it may be desirable that it should exist, in case it should become necessary to strengthen the prestige and efficiency of the law in Malta.(3) A provision should be inserted to the effect that there should be a limitation of the period within which the validity of any laws purporting to have been passed by the Legislature could be impugned in a Court of Law.(4) In the body of the Report the position of the police is considered. We think that the treatment of the Force has been too frequently influenced by party considerations. Such a position impairs efficiency and leads to apprehensions that efforts to maintain law and order will be misjudged for political reasons.Our desire is that the Constitution should be restored with as few amendments as possible, and therefore, though we think the position of the superior officers might well be made more secure, we only recommend that the Governor should watch carefully the working of the present police system and later, if it works unsatisfactorily, make recommendations to the Imperial Government regarding its amendment. Such amendment would presumably have to be effected by Act of Parliament. Any drastic revision of the Constitution required by the situa-tion could only be achieved by this method.(5) An amendment should be made in Section 30 of the Letters Patent, removing the disqualification of certain classes of voters, however small in number, and allowing persons disqualified as voters under that Section to vote after a maxi-mum period of eight years, the period to be at the discretion of the Court by which the person was sentenced. In the case of persons sentenced to hard labour the maximum period should be five years, and in the case of persons sentenced to simple imprisonment the maximum period should be two years.(6) Lastly, should it be decided to have recourse to an Act of Parliament, we consider that it would be advisable to
include in it a general endorsement of the Letters Patent of 1921, 1928 and 1930 and all that has been done thereunder, including the Order in Council of 1930 and the Ordinances thereunder, and the Acts of the Maltese Legislature validated by Ordinance., saving the rights of the Maltese Legislature to repeal or amend such Acts of the Legislature. There should not be included an endorsement of the Electoral Act No. XXVI of 1929, as we think it should be repealed and the election be held under the Electoral Act of 1924, as amended by Acts Nos. Ill and XXXI of 1927.Main Recommendation.We desire, in conclusion, to state clearly that our main recom-mendation is not in any way contingent upon effect being given to the foregoing suggestions. That recommendation and the steps which we advise should be taken for giving effect to it may be summarized as follows: (1) Parliamentary government should be restored and an election should take place in due course.(2) We strongly advise that the services of Ministers should be dispensed with at an early date, in order that the election may be, as far as possible, free from political bias and from the allegation that undue influence has been exercised. We con-sider the officials quite capable of conducting the election under the instructions of the Governor without the assistance of Ministers... (3) Parliamentary government can be restored by the issue of a proclamation by the Governor taking out of operation the Order in Council of the 26th June, 1930, in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the Order.(4) Prior to the restoration of Parliamentary government the Electoral Act No. XXVI of 1929 should be repealed by Governors Ordinance, and the Electoral Act of 1924. as amended by Acts Nos. Ill and XXXI of 1927 should be re-enacted in the same Ordinance. The election should then be held under the Electoral Act of 1924 as amended in 1927.(5) The election should not be a continuation of the election commenced under the Electoral Act No. XXVI of 1929 and subsequently suspended.(.6) For the purpose of the election, the Governor, under the powers given to him under the Letters Patent of 1921, should
nominate such Trade Unions as he thinks fit to form a con-stituent body to elect members for the Trade Union Council entitled to appoint two representatives to the Senate, advisably omitting small benefit unions or unions not representative in their character, but not ignoring unions because they failed to register under Act No. XXI of 1929. Local advice should be taken upon the selection in such manner as the Governor may determine.We do not think that an election earned out in the manner we have suggested could be successfully impugned in a Court of Law or that there would be any risk that those who are returned as members of the Legislature could be unseated upon the ground that the election was invalid.We are not able to advise any step to be taken by Your Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to any new Pastoral likely to be issued, but we would repeat our belief that any new Pastoral will be of a different character from the Pastoral of 1930, and we would refer again to the paragraphs with which we closed the main body of our Report before summing up these conclusions.ALL OF WHICH WE HUMBLY SUBMIT FOB, YOUR MAJESTY&apos;S GRACIOUS CONSIDERATION.ASKWITH. WALTER EGERTON. JOHN DE SALIS.A. J. DAWE, Secretary. 29th January, 1932.

APPENDIX B. Instances of Delays in the Administration of Justice.Many cases of delays in the Daw Courts were brought to the attention of the Royal Commission. Some of the cases, particularly those affecting the Imperial Forces, may be selected as typical:  (1) In the case of Emmanuel Formosa v. W. A. Critchley for Engine Boom ers&apos; Social Glub, in April, 1930, the Engine Room Ax&apos;tificers&apos; Club was sued in the Civil Court by E. Formosa, who had been dismissed from the service of the Club and claimed the large sum of  108 as deferred pay. The following is a summary of the progress of the action:  29th April, 1930. writ served; 2nd May, 1930, case called, and the President, Vice-President, and Treasurer of the Club three Chief Petty Officers serving in 1T.M. ships attended the Court. Only the Plaintiffs charge was heard. Case again called in 21st May, on an uncertain date between then and the 9th June, on 9th June, on 27th June, and on an uncertain date in October. On each occasion all the Chief Petty Officers concerned attended, except on the occasions when the Fleet was absent from Malta, when only the Honorary Treasurer attended. On none of these five occasions was the case heard. On the 10th [November, the case was called for the seventh time, and only the evidence of the President and Honorary Treasurer heard. At this stage, on the 17th November, representation was made by the Com-mander-in-Chief to the Governor of the intolerable delay in disposing of the case, of the loss of the services of these naval ratings for the consider-able periods which their fruitless visits to the Court entailed, and of the heavy legal expenses which the ratings might be incurring. The case was next called on the 28th November, 1930, when evidence on behalf of the Defendants was completed and the case adjourned until the 10th December, when the Defendants&apos; legal adviser stated that judgment might be expected. On the 10th December, the case was adjourned by the Judge for the produc-tion of certain books. On the 21st December, information was received that judgment would be given on the 14th January, 1931. As this date was one on which the President of the Club would be absent from Malta in his ship, H.M.S. London, further representation was made to the Governor, as a result of which judgment was finally given for the defence, with costs, on the 9th January, 1931. Eight and a-half months were consumed in obtaining judgment on this claim, which by documentary evidence of the Club was considered to be completely fraudulent. Representatives of the Club attended the Courts on eleven occasions, usually for the whole morning, and on only five of those occasions were the proceedings advanced.(2) Another case cited was that of The Admiralty v. Barbara. On the night of the 26th December, 1927, a serious fire broke out. in a private house at Vittoriosa, occupied by Mr. G. Barbara as a clothing factory, and in close proximity to the Naval Victualling Yard and Clothing Store and Admiralty House. Mr. Barbara requested the assistance of the Dockyard Police and Fire Brigade, and this was given. By order of the Rear-Admiral, assistance was also given by the Duty Dockyard Tug and by a fire party from H.M.S. Egmont. The fire was extinguished by these services. Mr. Barbara agreed in writing on the following day to pay for the assistance rendered by the Dockyard Police and Fire Engine, and a claim for  38 Is. 9d. on this account was presented on the 26th April, 1928. Repayment of  56, the expenditure incurred by the Dockyard Tug and Egmont&apos;s fire party, was not claimed, as their action was mainly to prevent damage to Admiralty property.   On the 9th July, 1928, Barbara&apos;s legal adviser repudiated the12I5S
claim on the plea that no request for assistance was made. On the 13th July, the Dockyard replied, stating that the repudiation was not under-stood, as a written application for assistance was held. There was no reply to that letter. On the 20th August, Barbara called on the responsible officer, who informed him that he would have to advise putting the case in legal hands. On the 3rd September, the case was referred to the Legal Adviser to the Forces, who on the 4th September advised legal proceedings. A summons was issued on the 4th October. On the 22nd January, 1929, the Legal Adviser was asked how the matter stood. On the 31st January, he reported that the Plaintiffs pleadings had been heard by the Court, that the Defendant had still to be heard, and that the next hearing was due on the 19th February. On the 25th November, 1929, the Legal Adviser was asked how the matter stood, and on the 11th December he reported that the case would come up for hearing on the 4th February, 1930. On the 18th March, 1930, the Legal Adviser reported that the case was due for further hearing on the 3rd April and requested Barbara&apos;s signed appliea-tion and the attendance of two witnesses. On the 2nd June, the Legal Adviser reported that the case had been heard on the 31st May and had been adjourned to the 2nd July. On the 8th July, the Legal Adviser reported that the case had been again ad-journed to the 22nd October. On the 21st November, the Legal Adviser reported that the case had been heard on the 19th November and adjourned to the 13th December. On the 13th December, the case was heard and adjourned to the 31st January, 1931, when the case was called, but, owing to the illness of the Legal Adviser, was adjourned to the 28th February. On the 9th March, the Legal Adviser reported that the case was due for hearing on the 28th March, that the Plaintiffs evidence was concluded, but that the Defendant had still to be heard. On the 28th March, the case was called but Counsel for the Defendant was ill, so the case was adjourned to the 29th April. On that date, Counsel for the Defence was still ill and the case was adjourned to the 23rd May, when it was heard and adjourned to the 27th June, 1931. This ease had been before the Courts since the 19th November, 1928, and the Admiralty had asked the Commander-in-Chief on two occasions when it would be settled. The Royal Commission have no information as to the subsequent history of the case.(3) A third case brought to notice was that of Francesco Bonnici v. Midshipman Hobson, S.M.S. Qiieen Elizabeth. This case was still out-standing on the 9th June, 1931. On the 14th June, 1930, the Defendant hired for the afternoon from the Plaintiff a motor cycle, which was damaged by fire while being used by the Defendant. On the 3rd December, 1930, after his ship had been in Malta for over a month, the Defendant received a summons to appear before the High Court, the jurisdiction of the lower Courts being limited to  5, on the previous 28th October; the ship had been absent from Malta on that date, and it was then altered to the 16th December. The claim was for  18 compensation, and the Defendant was willing to pay  5. On the 16t)h December, the case was heard and adjourned. On the 9th January, 1931, it was again heard and the whole forenoon devoted to proving the Defendants name and age. On the 11th February, the case was again called but not heard, the Defendant, after waiting from 9 a.m. till noon, being told that he was not required. Early in March, a further hearing was taken and the facts of the case were again inquired into, with a fui-the,r indefinite adjournment. On the 4th May, a letter was received stating that the case was to come up for hearing on the 12th May. On that date, the Defendant waited at the Court from 9 a.m. until 12.15 p.m., when he was told that the case might not come on until 3 p.m. He was required on board his ship for duty before that time and was unable to remain.   The case was then once more
adjourned indefinitely. On the 16th May, the Commande,r-in-Chief re-presented the facts of the case to the Governor and sought his inter-vention to ensure its hearing and completion at a very early date, in order that the inconvenience to t)ho Service that had been experienced might not be further prolonged. A further hearing of the case took place on the 9th June, when it was again adjourned, as the Judge was not in attendance.(4) In June, 1930, a slight collision occurred between a motor omnibus driven by a Maltese and a horse-drawn ambulance driven by a British soldier. As the driver of the ambulance and another soldier who was driving a motor ambulance behind the omnibus reported that the omnibus was being driven at an excessive speed, the matter was reported to the Commissioner of Police on the 4th July. The Maltese omnibus driver was not summoned until the 19th August and then failed to appear. The case was adjourned to the 23rd September. On that date an expert was appointed to inquire into the case and it was again adjourned for another five weeks. On the 4th November, a letter was sent to the Commissioner of Police, asking what, if an3&apos;, action was being taken. The expert then held his first sitting on the 13th November, five months after the accident, and another sitting on the 26th November, but only witnesses for the defence were called. In January, 1931, another letter was sent, and two months later in March  the Commissioner of Police replied, saying that the case had been adjourned sine die until the two soldiers returned to Malta. The answer was that one of them had never left Malta. After two more letters had been sent to the Commissioner of Police, asking if the case could be continued, it was stated that the Maltese driver had been acquitted on the 1st May, -over 10 months after the event.(5) In another case a motor car driven by an officer collided with a motor car driven by a Maltese, resulting in damage amounting to about  12. The officer was prosecuted and had to appear eight times in Court and once on the scene of the accident. Seven months after his first appearance, sen-tence was passed and he was fined 2s. 6d., which was remitted, because the Maltese was held to have contravened the speed regulation more than the officer. The Maltese was not prosecuted. The matter was brought to the notice of the Governor, who referred it to the Minister for Justice. The Minister for Justice stated that in the case in question in the Court of the Judicial Police more delay than usual had occurred, owing to (a) the neces-sity of appointing an expert, (6) the illness of the Magistrate, and (c) the absence of witnesses. He also stated that he had given orders that all witnesses should be secured for the next sitting. At the next sitting, how-ever, the case was again adjourned owing to the non-attendance of three witnesses.(6) In another case a military driver was tried before the Criminal Court of Magistrates for Judicial Police for driving at an excessive speed, over 10 miles an hour, in an inhabited place, the law prescribing a maximum of eight miles an hour. He had driven a military motor vehicle for a con-siderable distance behind an omnibus driven by a Maltese, who said that he himself was travelling at 20 miles an hour. The military driver was fined  1. The Maltese was brought before the Commissioner of Police and only admonished. Thus two men accused of the same offence at the same time and place were brought before different tribunals and received different treatment.   Both were first offenders.(7) In the case of Borg v. Colonel Mudie (the Officer in charge of Admini-stration), a soldier, Driver Surtees, on the 17th June, 1927, drove a motor ambulance into a gate-cart driven by a man named Borg. Surtees was tried and found guilty of negligence in driving but released as a first
offender. On the 18th November, 1927, five months after the accident, Borg brought an action in the High Court against Colonel Mudie, as Officer in charge of Administration, claiming  59 11s. 2d., besides loss of profits and incidental expenses, and in April, 1929, a summons was issued by First Hall, Civil Court. By that time Surtees, the only other man who had been with him on the ambulance and the officer who had given Surtees his orders had all left Malta. The subsequent history of the case was given to the Royal Commission by Colonel Mudie as follows:  &quot; 1st May, 1929, case came up too late; adjourned. 29th May, Plaintiffs Counsel ill; adjourned. 21st June, Plaintiffs Counsel asked for adjournment; adjourned. Pause of four months. 28th October, Court did not sit; all cases adjourned. 2nd November, adjourned. 13th November, first hearing of case, two years after the claim had been filed, and seven months after the summons had been issued. Two witnesses were examined and the case was adjourned. In May, 1930, the case came up again and was adjourned for another five months, to the 7th October. My Counsel, a Maltese advocate, who is Legal Adviser to the Forces, reported that &apos; as Plaintiff did not put in an appearance, the case was adjourned sine die.&apos; Plaintiff filed an applica-tion for re-hearing and the case came again before the Court on the 13th November and was adjourned to the 27th November, when it was called ahead of its turn, but the Judge considered that it was too late to hear evidence and adjourned it to the 20th January, 1931. I again complained and was advised to apply for an earlier sitting, as the last remaining military witness was on the point of leaving the Island and had not yet been heard, although it was 19 months since the case was first brought before the Court. I was advised to apply to have the case heard before the Christmas vacation and, if necessary, continued during it. I took this advice and the case was brought forward on the 23rd December, when my witness and two witnesses for the Plaintiff were heard, and the case adjourned for further evidence by Plaintiff to the 13th January, 1931. The Judge at this sitting became aware that he as a Magistrate had dealt with the case in the Police Court about three and a-half years before, so the case was adjourned to be tried by another Judge. 2nd February, Plaintiffs witness failed to appear: adjourned. 11th February, one of Plaintiffs witnesses was heard but Plaintiff said he was trying to get others; adjourned. 2oth February, Plaintiffs Counsel said he had not received information from the police regarding the witnesses he wanted to call. Adjourned for judgment. 13th March, Plaintiff produced as witnesses four constables, none of whom knew any-thing about the matter; adjourned. 13th April, judgment given against Plaintiff with costs, three years and 10 months after the accident and just two years after the issue of the summons.&quot;

Such person shall forthwith cease to be a Member of the Council if his appointment is disallowed by TJs, or if the Member in whose place he was appointed shall be released from suspension, or, as the case may be, shall be declared by the Governor capable of again discharging his func-tions in the Council, or shall return to the Island.(3) The Governor shall without delay report to TJs, for Our confirmation or disallowance, through one of Our Principal Secretaries of State, every provisional appointment of any person as a Member of the Nominated Council. Every such person shall hold his place in the Council during Our Pleasure, and the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Island, revoke any such appointment.17.

And We do hereby require and command all Our Officers and Ministers, Civil and Military, and all other the inhabitants of Malta to be obedient, aiding and assisting unto the Governor or to such person or persons as may from time to time under the provisions of these Our Letters Patent administer the Government of the Island.20.
