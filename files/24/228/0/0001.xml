INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION LIMITING HOURS OF WORK IK COAL MINES. Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.This Convention, which was adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation of the League of Nations in June, 1931, limits the time to be spent by workers In underground ooal mines to 7-f hours per day and contains various provisions as to overtime, Sunday work and similar points, as well as special provisions regarding lignite mining.The daily limit of 7f hours is to be oalculated on the &quot;Bank to bank&quot; basis, which is in force on the Continent, under which the time is taken from the moment when the man enters the cage to descend to the moment when he leaves it after asoending.    Certain variations, however, are admitted, one of which is the method in force In Great Britain under whioh the daily limit is fixed from the descent of the last man of the shift to the ascent of the first man of the same shift.     The Conference accepted the true average &quot;man winding&quot; time for shifts In this country as 30 minutes, and the Convention lays it down that 7-f hours &quot;bank to bank&quot; means, in terms of our legislation, 7j hours &quot;between man windings&quot;. This is accepted by everyone concerned in Great Britain as a reasonable equivalent.The Convention represents, therefore,  a compromise in regard to the length of the working day between the present maximum in Great Britain (7r hours)  and the maximum laid down by the Act of 1919 (7 hours), which would automatically oome into force again, in the absence of further legislation, In July,  1932.The events which led up to the adoption of the Convention and the attitude towards it of the ooal owners and the miners in this oountry are set out in detail in Appendix I to this
 Iknote.   Briefly, the owners are completely opposed to the ratification of the Convention,  and the miners are equally strongly in favour of it.On 7th January, 1932, I attended an informal meeting at Geneva convened by the International Labour Office at the initiative of the British Government in the circumstancee described in Appendix I.   Representatives -of the Governments of France, Germany, Poland, Belgium,Holland and czechoslovakia were also present, for the purpose of discussing the possibilities of ratification.It should be explained that the Convention itself provides that it should come into foroe (for those countries which have ratified it) six months after ratification by the aeoond of the seven principal coal producing countries of Europe  (the six just   mentioned and ourselves).It is generally realised by all parties that no two countries are likely to take this step while their competitors hang back,  and, Indeed, the British and German Governments put forward in June a joint amendment providing that ratification by all seven countries should be necessary to bring the Convention into force.    This amendment was rejected in Committee by 20 votes to 18.In opening the proceedings at the meeting on 7th January, I explained that the British Government, owing to pressure of other business, had not yet had an opportunity of considering the Convention in detail,  and that I was therefore unable to make any definite statement cf policy in the matter, although I felt able to declare our adhesion to the principle of the International regulation of the hours of work in ooal mines.The attitude of the various Governments as expressed at the meeting was as followss-
France was  In favour of ratification as soon as possible, and had not considered what attitude she would adopt if other countries refused to ratify.Holland and Czechoslovakia were prepared to ratify theConvention at any time, provided the six other countries did so simultaneously.Germany agreed that ratification when it came must besimultaneous by all seven countries, but was inclined to think that the present moment, in view of the financial condition of Europe, was not opportune for ratification.     She wished to wait and see what was the outcome of the forthcoming meetings to deal with the European situation.Poland showed no desire for immediate ratification, but avoided taking up a definite attitude of opposition.Belgium urged that, owing to the physical difficulties under which her coal mines had to work, she should be allowed to ratify one or two years after the other six countries.On behalf of Great Britain, I stated that our primary requirement was that ratification, whenever it came, must be simultaneous ratification by all the seven countries represented at this meeting,      I added that, if and when simultaneous ratification was agreod to, we reserved the right to raise some subsidiary Questions in regard to the oetailed application of the Convention (i.e. the more serious of the difficulties cited by the coal owners - vide Appendix II.). These questions, however, we regarded as of secondary importance to that of simultaneous ratification, and we did not propose to raise thorn until the main issue had been decided.The meeting then adjourned, having authorised the
International Labour Office to call another meeting, and having provisionally fixed April next for that meeting.A decision is now required as to the line of policy to he adopted by Great Britain.      I do not think that we can, or should,, defer any longer a specific public announcement on the subject.As explained in detail in Appendix I. , the question has a very definite bearing on the situation which will arise in July next when our present legislation regarding hours of work in coal mines will expire.      If, at that time the Convention is really a live issue, it will undoubtedly have its effect in influencing the Miners&apos; Federation tc agree to a continuation in this country of the status quo (i.e.  7-g-hours)  and to accept the position that, in future, reductions in the daily hours of work in coal mines must be effected on a ISuropean basis.      If, on the other hand, the Convention appears at that time to be a dead letter, it will   at once strengthen the hands of those miners&apos; leaders who desire to press for a reversion in July to the 7-hour day, and will also encourage intransigeance on the part of the coal owners,The owners&apos; reasons for opposing ratification are set out in detail in Appendix II., and in some of them there is undoubted substance.      The owners are strongly opposed to ratification,  even if the step is taken simultaneously by all seven of the principal coal producing countries of Europe.      Indeed, prior to their meeting with me in December last, they appeared to have taken it for granted that the present Government would reverse the policy of the late Government, and reject the Convention altogether.      Strong and persistent opposition is therefore to be anticipated frjm this gjuarter.
I am quite satisfied, in the circumstances, that the time has now come for a definite pronouncement one way or the other. as a matter of fact, a Parliamentary Question on the subject is already down for answer on 3rd February -There appear to be only two alternative lines of policy open now, and I suggest that we must in the near future formally announce our adherence to one or other of these, viz:-1. that Great Britain has decided, owing to numerous practical difficulties which have emerged on further consideration of the Convention, that she cannot ratify it at all in its present form.      (This means, in effect, the end of the Convention,  since the process of amendment would be virtually equivalent to negotiating a new Convention), or 2. that Great Britain is prepared to ratify the Convention provided that the other six countries principally concerned agree to do so simultaneously - subject to the reservation that, when the major question of simultaneous ratification has been decided, we have certain secondary points relating to the detailed application of the Convention in this country which we shall want to raise.The first of these alternatives would please the mine owners, but (as already explained) would make the position vis-a-vis the miners in regard to July next much more difficult, and would also expose us to attack by the Continental Governments mentioned above.     This was quite apparent from the attitude adopted by the representatives of several of these Governments (notably . Prance) at the recent meeting.     Furthermore, such a policy would be hard to reconcile with the general blessing bestowed upon the Convention by the leaders of all three political parties in July last (see Appendix I., third paragraph).      In the circumstances I hardly regard this alternative as practical politics.-b-
The second alternative would ease the situation as regards the miners in this country and other   Governments on the Continent, as it would leave some other country or countries responsible for failure to ratify.It would also establish the best position possible in July next.     The industry cannot afford to come down to 7 hours while competing countries are working 7-g- hours without a reduction of wages more serious than can be contemplated. Further legislation extending the 7  hours after July will be necessary (I hope as the result of an agreement between owners and men) but such extension cannot be completely indefinite in period v/hile, on the other hand, it would be disastrous to name a definite period and so again fix the date of the next trouble in the industry.The International Convention provides   the only middle course, and a pronouncement in its favour would leave us free when the time comes to extend the 7-g-hour day until reduced by international agreement.The announcement will certainly displease the owners, who will complain of an additional burden on the industry at a time when it is quite unable to support it.     I am satisfied, however, that there is little prospect of simultaneous ratification by all seven countries concerned for some years, and, if the situation in this respect should unexpectedly change, we shall still have reserved the right to raise the more important of our specific domestic difficulties in the application of the Convention before taking the final step.For these reasons I ask that I may be authorised to make an announcement as suggested at (2) on page 5 of this memorandum.i.Intd.)

APPENDIX I.International Labour Convention on the hours of work in coal mines.Historical Note and Summary of the position prior to the meeting at Geneva in January 1952.The discussions at Geneva which led up to the adoption of the Convention began in January, 1930, and the British Government of the day worked throughout for a Convention involving a maximum working day which would mean in Great Britain something less than 7^ hours.     They proposed 7^ hours &quot;bank to bank&quot;, which would mean 7 hours in this country (the maximum which was in operation from 1919 to 1926).     The British (and Continental) miners wanted a shorter period still, but eventually both accepted the figure in the Convention (i.e. 7^ in United Kingdom) as the lowest that could be obtained at present.The British (and Continental) mine owners have consistentlyopposed any Convention providing for less than 8 hours &quot;bank tobank&quot;, and they object to the existing draft for a number ofother reasons.      The principal objections of the British owners,with notes by the Mines Department, are set out in the tabularstatement attached, and are referred to later on in this note.The Convention was welcomed by the Prime Minister, byMr. Baldwin,  and by Sir Herbert Samuel in the course of theHouse of Commons debates on the Coal Mines Bill, 1931, and1752       Section 3(4) of the Act specifically refers to it in limiting -56-58       the duration of the Act to a period of one year or until thecoming into operation of an Act to give effect to the Convention - whichever period may be the shorter.     In this way the Convention has already become, at any rate in name, directly linked to the machinery for regulating miners&apos; hours in this country.
It has, however, always been clear that the ratification of the Convention would involve a number of practical difficulties, apart from the general opposition of the coal owners on grounds of principle;    and my predecessor accordingly decided to ask the International Labour Office, as a first step, to arrange for an informal meeting of the Government representatives of the seven countries primarily concerned (Great Britain, Germany, Prance, Poland, Belgium, Netherlands and Czechoslovakia) to discuss procedure for ratification;   but I understand that he intended to use the opportunity also for the purpose of friendly exploration of the various practical difficulties involved.     This meeting was first fixed for September, then postponed to October, and then again postponed owing to the political situation.     A short time ago I had a visit from M. Thomas, the Director of the International Labour Office, who expressed anxiety as to the new Governments attitude in regard to ratification. It seemed clear to me that we could not, without serious risk of misrepresentation, fail to go forward with the exploratory plan referred to above, and accordingly, after consulting with the President of the Board of Trade, I announced on 8th December, in answer to a Parliamentary Question, that at the request of the British Government, the International Labour Office was inviting representatives of the other six Governments concerned to attend an informal meeting at Geneva on 7th January.Attitude of Owners and Workmen.(a) Owners.On the above announcement being made in Parliament, the Mining Association asked me to meet them and discuss the question of ratification.     They told me plainly that
uunder present economic conditions they objected to any Convention reducing hours of work, and especially to one in the present form.     They developed the objections set out in the attached statement and emphasised particularly their fear that the provisions of the Convention,  if and when ratified, would be enforced much more honourably and strictly in Great Britain than elsewhere, with the result that we should be more severely handicapped than our competitors.      Of the more detailed objections they laid most stress on the limitation of Sunday work, which forbids an ordinary shift finishing on Sunday morning or beginning on Sunday night, and on the impossibility, in practice, of calculating the payment of a higher rate for overtime in the case of pieceworkers.The owners are in fact uncompromisingly opposed to ratification, both on principle and in detail, and are clearly expecting the present Government to take a different view of it from that of the late Government,     Their objections (see Appendix II.) are not all of equal weight, some of them are undoubtedly valid and important;   and the increasing difficulty and uncertainty of the economic situation tends to increase their importance, (b) T-7o rkmen.I formally invited the views of the Miners&apos; Federation, in the light of the January meeting, and have had a letter from Mr. E. Edwards, their President,  in the course of which he describes the Convention as &quot;representing the maximum of compromise by the British miners&quot;, and assumes that I am proceeding to Geneva in January &quot;to press on behalf of the British Government for immediate ratification&quot;.     I also discussed the question with Mr. Edwards before going to Geneva.
The workmen&apos;s attitude is clear;    they strongly favour ratification (though they realise quite well, that Great Britain can only take such action if and when the other countries chiefly concerned do the same).     As well a s supporting the   Convention on general grounds, the workmen regard It as an important &quot;bargaining&quot; factor, in relation to the special problem of hours (and, indirectly, wages) in this country.    The 1931 Act temporarily extending the 7-s- hours day and preventing wage reductions below the levels of last June comes to an end on 7th July, 1932;    and If the workmen can secure ratification before then,   or at any rate a specific promise of ratification by the Government, they will consider their position vis-a-vis the owners considerably strengthened. For they would then be able to say (e.g.) &quot;We have now got the 7x hour day   specifically accepted, at any rate in principle, by the Government:    so if we are to be asked to submit for the time being to a continuance of 7-g- hours, the least we are entitled to in return is some quid pro quo in the matter of wages&quot;.There is, however, another and very important consideration from the Miners&apos; Federation point of viewv    Since 1926 a return to the 7-houre&apos; day lias been the main plank in the Miners&apos; Federation policy.   Although it is alleged that the enthusiasm of the rank and file for a return to 7 hours has evaporated, the fact remains that It is still the officialpolicy of the Federation and that it is very difficult for them to drop it.    Indeed, any important official who openly advocated such a course would almost certainly lose his post.The industry cannot afford a shorter day than the present 7-1- hours without such a cut in wages as would lead to a
general stoppage, so, if the 7-g- hour day is to be maintained after 7th July a line of retreat for the Miners1 Federation must be found *Sufficient progress towards a ratification of the International Convention to provide the necessary excuse for accepting a continuance of the 7-g- hour day and to make further changes depondent on international regulations of hours seems at any rate a possible way out of tiift difficulty, though it is as yet too early to see exactly how the general situation as to hours and wages after July will develope

APPENDIX II.INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE KOUHS OP WORK IN COAL MUTES.ng Association&apos;a reasons for &quot;pposing ratlFioation.There is no prospect offication by overseas.tries - e.g. United States,h Africa, India andralia - which compete with Britain in variousets.The reduction of -J hour per in working time would meanNotes by Mines Department.It&apos; is quite true that there is no prospect of ratification by these countries, at any rate for a long time.    But the discus-si ons which led up to the Convention were started at the request of the League of Nations in order to do something to meet the situation in the coal producing countries in Europe, and there has never been any detailed consideration of the conditions in extra-European countries. The figure of 6d, is probably a little on the high side-    Lut there is some com-vsrage increase of about 6d.    pensation from the British coal ovmer&apos;ston in the cost of produc-in Great Britain.    VJages oland being about halfin Great 3ritain, this d give Poland an advantage d. per ton, unless wages in t Britain were reduced.There is no provision for ng up on other days time through a short working on Saturday or where the en day fortnight is worked.That lignite has been ted more leniently thanpoint of view inasmuch as another provi-sion in the Convention makes considerable reductions in the amount of overtime permissible in competing countries (e.g. Germany, where legislation introduced in 1930 provided for 300 hours overtime per annum in hard coal mines - the Convention says SO).This is the fspreadover&apos;, which was per-miesible under British Legislation from December 1930 to July 1931, but is not no\v possible under the Coal Mines Act, 1931, Except for those few months it has never been provided for in Great Britain. This is true, but the provisions as to lignite mines are a good deal less favour-able than the German Government were originally prepared to accept, and a great deal less favourable than the conditions
i QThat the 60 hours over-permitted by the Con-ion may be used in other litries by way of a regular ition to the length of the icing day, and that the ision for payment of 25% ra may be got over by ju3ting* the daily wage. That the Convention bids the employment of 8 under 13 on Sunday, that this isaairable from the safety nt of view, as it means employment of adults vork (e.g. haulage) to oh they are not ustomed.under which they now work.    The Germany Government fought hard over this, and stated very definitely that the provisions in the Convention were the very minimum that would enable their lignite mining industry to continue to exist.This is true, but in legislating in this country (as will be necessary before we can ratify) we can take power to allow the same thing here, provided the mine owners can make the necessary agreement with the men in regard to the extra time and extra payment.There is something in the safety point, but the change would not be made suddenly without notice, and men over 18 could soon learn the work, even if the difficulty could not be met by using on Sunday men only just over 18 who had previously been employed as youths on the work required.This difficulty was realised before the Convention was adopted, as was that (No, 7 below) regarding the shift starting on Sunday night, and attention was called to them both in a note prepared by the Mines Department in the spring of this year, when the draft Article prepared by the International Labour Office was published.    The considered policy of the British Government, however, was to avoid as far as possible any amendments to the International Labour Office draft unless
) That the first shift of the k would be unable to start ore midnight on the Sunday, ,h the result that all shifts ough the week would be put k, and the early finish on urday prevented. That the provision for rter working time in abnormal ditions of temperature, etc. unnecessary.That the additional \ hour day permitted for certain ssee of continuous shift iers is not sufficient toble them to change over at working place, and that it is te Illogical to require over-rates of payment for this a work.) That the Convention should come into force, as provided ne of the Articles, after any of the seven principal coal ucing countries of Europe ratified it.there was general agreement, and these points were not therefore pressed at the Ccnferenoe in June.See preceding note.   This Is probably the most eerious objection and one which must be met in some way.These regulations are to be made for &apos;particularly unhealthy 1 places, and each Government is left to be the Judge as to whether conditions necessitate shorter hours.The former is another genuine diffi-culty, although it must have arisen and had to be dealt with between 1919 and 1926, when the 7 hour day was in opera-tion In this country, and the latter is also a point of substance. Both were re-oognised by the Mines Department, but in this case also the general policy of the British Government in June applied.This Is accepted, taoltly at any rate, by all parties, and discussions with the other governments concerned are being arranged to explore the possibili-ties of simultaneous ratification. Another possibility would be to make our ratification conditional on that of other countries.
That the interpretation Conventions, a a well as the idard of enforcement, varies different countries, to the riment of industry in Great tain.This, of course, applies to all Conventions.   Attempts have been made at Geneva, so far, unfortunately, not with very mush success, to secure more information, through the reports of the various governments, as to the standard of enforcement.   These attempts will no doubt be continued, but the solution of the problem is not easy.
