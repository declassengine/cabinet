WELLESLEY AND SIR J. PRATT ON ANGLO-JAPANESE RELATIONS AND THE PRESENT CRISIS IN CHINA.[Circulated by Direction oe the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.]1. Memorandum by Sir V. Wellesley.I SHOULD like to submit an appreciation of the situation in the Far East, as I see it, with a view to facilitating a decision as to the course of action which we are to pursue.The present crisis in Shanghai is a direct repercussion from the situation in Manchuria. There is as yet no &quot; Shanghai Problem &quot; between Japan and China  though there may be very soon. At present, the Shanghai affair is on the fringe of the Japan-China problem, though it may very soon become central.The crux of the J apan-China problem in recent years has been the question of Manchuria. I shall, therefore, take Manchuria first, for the purposes of this review. Further, if Manchuria is the crux of the Japan-China problem, then the railway controversy is the centre of the Manchurian question.Manchuria.Manchuria (or the Three Eastern Provinces) is the country of origin of the dynasty which ruled China Proper from 1644 to 1911. Its position might be compared to that of Egypt, if an Egyptian dynasty had replaced the Ottoman Sultans at Stamboul Manchuria was neglected under the Emperors; and in 1896 the Peking Government granted a railway concession with very wide administra-tive rights to Russia, in the hope of securing that country&apos;s support against Japan. Japan defeated Russia at great cost of blood and treasure, and acquired the rights of Russia in South Manchuria by the Treaty of Portsmouth (1905). On the basis of this acquisition Japan has built up vested interests and rights which in fact give her a very special position in this province (they are valued very roughly at about  200 million). She has confirmed her position by various treaties with the Chinese, some of which China now wishes to repudiate on the ground that they were extorted by force (1915 treaties that resulted from the Twenty-One Demands) or by corruption (1918 agreements). Her position in Manchuria has not been seriously questioned by the Powers. It may be argued that it has in fact been accepted, since the Consortium Agreement of 1921 definitely excepted from its scope certain railway construction in Manchuria which was reserved specifically for Japan.North Manchuria (capital, Harbin) formed the Russian sphere. It has been an objective of Japanese military policy to advance in this direction, but an attempt to do so in 1918-19 failed, and from that date onward to 1931 Japanese policy in China has been opposed to forward movements; but within the last few days (January 1932) the advance on Harbin has apparently been resumed.In South Manchuria, Japan has developed her sphere with notable success, transforming that uneconomic waste into some semblance of a civilised country. Towns such as Dairen and Mukden have become important trading centres with6225   [6563] b
both Japanese and European establishments. The more these interests develop, the greater is the call upon the local Administration for the maintenance of order and protection. The Chinese authorities who are nominally in control of the province are quite unable to meet this demand; not only so, but they have been actively engaged in circumventing the Japanese position, e.g., by establishing railway competition with the South Manchurian Railway in spite of their under-taking not to do so, and thereby jeopardising the earning capacity of the Japanese line. This question of railway control and competition is the centre of the Manchurian question, which-up to the latest events at Shanghai has been the crux of the Japan-China problem.Let me add that, owing, to the protection of Japanese influence, there has been an immense immigration of Chinese into Manchuria, especially of recent years. The population of the country is now about 30 millions (i.e., about the same as Poland), having increased from quite small figures&apos;as recently as thirty years ago. The Japanese population remains very low (about 230,000 real Japanese and about 607,000 Koreans^)); the Japanese agriculturalist cannot compete down to the Chinese standards.It is difficult to find an exact parallel to the position of Japan in Manchuria. I have already drawn one analogy from Egypt. The Japanese are fond of comparing their position in Manchuria to that of the British in Egypt. The comparison is superficial but instructive.Whether it can be justified on strictly legal grounds or not, Japan regards her position in Manchuria as a vital national interest, and therefore sacrosanct. She will not tolerate interference by any other Power in this region; and she is determined to force the Chinese to respect Japanese treaty rights and to abstain from any further interference with her economic interests and with the good government of the country.In order to achieve this it Avould appear to be her policy to foster the creation of a buffer State, a Manchurian Republic (or monarchy), independent of the Central Government of China and its intrigues, and unable to shelter itself behind Nanking. This new State would have to agree with Japan on Japan&apos;s terms, and settle the railway and other questions in a satisfactory way.There is much to be said in favour of such a solution. The size of the county and its growing population, its historical and economic detachment from China proper, would justify this partition. Indeed, in point of fact, Manchuria lias been a separate entity for the last fifteen years or so.I believe this to have been the limit of Japanese intentions regarding Manchuria (and China) up to the close of last year. But in their attempt to coerce the Chinese into acceptance of their desires, they apparently failed to realise the difficulty of localising the conflict, which was bound to have its repercussions in other parts of China, and, in the form of a boycott of Japanese goods, to spread among Chinese communities in other parts of the world, e.g., Siam, Indo-China, Malaya, Dutch East Indies, Philippines, &amp;c. The boycott has led to intensive exasperation on both sides, and so to the latest explosion at Shanghai.China and Japan.Having explained the immediate cause of this explosion, my analysis would be incomplete without a brief outline of the more remote causes which lie in the history of the last forty years, which have been years of almost continuous struggle between China and Japan. These two countries are separated by mutual antipathy and contempt. They are united by close economic connexion, and by the fact that they constitute, by themselves and in themselves, a kind of organic bivalve, which is in a category of its own among national groupings.As national entities, both Japan and China have a cosmopolitan aspect (much in evidence at Geneva) and also a purely oriental aspect. This latter is inscrutable to us Europeans, but is quite easily comprehensible to the two nations immediately concerned. This oriental aspect, both of Japan and China, appears to us to be puerile, deceitful, cruel and savage.For various reasons the cosmopolitan side developed more quickly and more successfully in Japan than in China, and Japan is now one of the Great Powers. But the oriental aspect of her policy in China remains much as it was.   It is not(i) This figure is taken from the Manchurian Year Book ; it is probably an underestimate.
in time with the ideals of Geneva. It does not occur to the Japanese that the aspirations of the League have any application to the immediate, practical and almost indecently domestic issues involved in Japan&apos;s relations with her oriental neighbour all the more because the Chinese orators at Geneva deliberately use the League to bamboozle foreign Governments about the real state of China and for that purpose only.Japanese policy in China has varied with the flow of the times.(1) Defensive (1890-95) : The Sino-Japanese War was fought to keep off the Chinese menace from the shores of Japan.(2) Intrusive (1895-1914) : To obtain in China a position equal to that of the Treaty Powers. This involved the war with Russia, who had challenged this intrusion where she herself wished to intrude, and the acquisition of territorial rights in South Manchuria.(3) Aggressive (1914-21) : The attempt during the war to obtain special rights, superior to those of other Powers, e.g., hegemony in China. This attempt was unsuccessful and recoiled upon Japan. It ended in the abrogation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and what was virtually a trial of Japan before a court of the nations at Washington.(4) Conciliatory (1922-27) : Commercial interests in Japan, with increasing extension of business and fear of boycotts, were co-operating with the Foreign Office (after its Washington experiences) in developing a policy of friendly relations the Shidehara &quot; policy, as opposed to the military policies of force and bullying. In 1923 came the great earthquake, which for some years shattered the self-confidence of Japan.(5) Resentful (1927-32) : A change for the worse, due to the failure of a friendly policy and the increasing Nationalist sentiment in China. The first clashes were at Tsinanfu in 1927 and 1928; but the real struggle was developing in Manchuria over the Chinese policy of encirclement of the South Manchurian line. This led to the outbreak of the present struggle in September 1931, after the Japanese had been trying for at least five years to solve the railway and other problems in Manchuria by peaceful negotiation.Such, in barest outline, is the historical background to the recent events in Manchuria and Shanghai. Relations between Japan and China have been in a state of struggle, sometimes greater, sometimes less, for the last forty years. Among much uncertainty, we can be tolerably sure that the struggle is one that will continue indefinitely.In this struggle military force is preponderantly on the side of Japan, but military force is out of date in the modern world, even in the Far East. It can impose a temporary silence, but it cannot evoke a permanent answer. Japan has not yet learned this lesson, and may yet do a great deal of damage before she does. She still breathes an atmosphere of gun-grease, and has rather primitive ideas about victory and conquest.Up to 1918 military (and naval) influences were paramount in the oligarchy which ruled Japan. Japanese military policy in Manchuria (and also in China) were revealed in the Twenty-One Demands of 1915, but were repudiated (under Anglo-American pressure) at the Washington Conference inl921-22. The policy of conciliation, &quot; Shidehara policy,&quot; was then adopted. It failed, notably in Manchuria; and a reaction has been steadily growing in Japan in favour of stronger methods. The Military policy was gaining ground at the expense of the Foreign Office policy. There are indications that the events of September 1931 were precipitated by a military-Fascist plot in Japan to eject the rather Liberal Minseito Government and set up a Government which would settle the Manchurian business once and for all. The Government, however, did not try-to check its military dictators, though the at times complete divergence between Foreign Office assurances and actual happenings in Manchuria, showed that Japan was in a state of divided imle. The Minseito Government has now fallen, and with a septuagenarian Premier, an insignificant Foreign Minister, and a public opinion favourable to a strong policy, the military and naval politicians have the country&apos;s destiny at their disposal.Anglo-Japanese Relations.It would, in view of conflicting accounts, be imprudent to pronounce a too hasty judgment on the rights and wrongs of recent events at Shanghai, nor is it[6563! . b 2
necessary for the purpose of this memorandum, which is concerned with the possible effects on British interests of Japanese resentment resulting from the action or attitude we may decide to adopt. Whether such action be justified or not is immaterial to the present enquiry.(2)In the persistent Chinese-Japanese struggle, British policy has oscillated between the traditional friendship with Japan and the potential attraction of the Chinese market. Japan flirts with British, as with French, friendship. She once made a serious attempt to renew a kind of alliance, at the time of Count Uchida&apos;s visit to England (1928), but did not meet with any encourage-ment. She fears the power of the United States and dislikes the tendencies of American policy in China, irresponsible encouragement of China s &quot;aspirations.&quot; She fears and would resent most of all an Anglo-American combination to thwart her purposes and curtail her power.If we tend to join with America in criticism of, and perhaps in pressure on, Japan, will she give way, as she did at the time of the Washington Conference, or will she resist ?   And, if so, what will be the result upon us of her resistance&apos;?Our aims and interests in China are political and economic. Our political aims are defined in our declaration of December 1926, and consist in the liquidation of the old treaty position in China, so that our relations with China may be readjusted to modern conditions. We wish to live in friendship with a strong and orderly China. We wish to see commercial relations maintained and expanded according to the principles of the &quot;Open Door for all&quot; policy which we have always supported. We desire to protect and expand our vested interests and our commercial interests both in Japan and China.There is a very considerable British vested interest in China. Our interests in Shanghai alone are supposed (according to the press) to be wrorth  250 million. Then there are shipping and insurance interests, investments in railways and in Government bonds, banking and trade of all kinds. Actual trade figures show a rather unexpected approximation of our trade with China and Japan respectively :  Thousand  .1929. 1930.British exports to Japan ... 13,435 8,229British re-exports to Japan ... 207 168British imports from Japan ... 9,132 8,064British exports to China ... 14,029 8,572British re-exports to China ... 117 86British imports from China 12,157 9,914(These figures do not include British Dominions trade, which is of considerable importance, both with China and Japan. Next to the United States and China, British India is Japan&apos;s best customer.)The British investment in Japan consists of Government and municipal bonds which have been issued on the London market, including South Manchurian Railway debentures. British companies own two or three factories in Manchuria, but very little in Japan proper.At present, therefore, our balance of economic interest in these two countries is fairly equal; but, since China is one of the great undeveloped markets of the world, it is felt (probably justly) that our interest in China is of far greater potential value.Assuming that Japan&apos;s attitude becomes definitely hostile to us in China, how far is she in a position to impair our interests and to thwart our political aims ? Here we have several considerations to take into account: First, Japan&apos;s naval and military position; secondly, the weakness of China to resist her; thirdly, the internal situation in Japan; and, fourthly, the power of the League and of America to force her into submission.(1) Naval and military predominance of Japan. This is the outstanding-fact in the Far Eastern situation. Japan, in the Far East, is unattackable by sea or land. This was accepted and endorsed by Great Britain and the United States in the Naval Treaty of Washington (1922), when the United States(2) There is, of course, now no longer any doubts as to Japanese intentions.
abandoned the further fortification of Guam Island, her advanced base in the Pacific, and Great Britain declared that she would add nothing further to the inadequate defences of Hong Kong about the same time Great Britain, United States, Japan and France guaranteed (in another treaty) each other&apos;s insular possessions in the Pacific. These treaties gave an effective guarantee of security to Japan, and the power to do what she liked in China.(2) China&apos;s weakness. China cannot resist by force of arms. There are, however, other forms of passive resistance, which make it impossible for one to envisage any extended or permanent &quot;rule&quot; by Japan over China. This, however, does not exclude the possibility of the seizure of treaty ports by Japan and other strictly limited areas.(3) The internal situation in Japan is of the greatest importance. Usually the commercial elements are opposed to violent action in China, but they now appear to be silent. The Japanese people as a whole support the policy of force. In the present emergency, the army and navy dominate the Government. These are feverish symptoms. It is not impossible that, especially if exasperated by foreign pressure, we might see something like a Fascist movement in Japan, or a Government, forced by popular excitement and militarist die-hards to embark upon a policy of adventure far exceeding anything which we have witnessed as yet. An excitable people like the Japanese, armed with formidable military power, are capable of any excess, and might, if driven to it, defy the world. Having shaken oft&apos; the paper shackles of the League, she could revert to her old cry of a &quot; Monroe doctrine for Asia,&quot; i.e., no foreign political influence in China other than Japanese. There seems no limit to the damage which Japanese hostility could do to us, if Japan were out for blood. It could be clone very quickly, too, and resistance would take a long time to organise. Without American support, we probably could not resist. A Chinese attack on Japanese at Hong Kong, for instance, might provoke a situation with serious consequences.(4) The power of the League and of America to force Japan into submission. The League has no effective means to intervene. The only Power which possesses economic influence over Japan sufficient to bring her to her senses -or to drive her completely out of them is the United States. The figures speak for themselves : Millions of yen.1928. 1929.Total exports from Japan ...          ... 2.196 2,216Total imports to Japan    ...          ... 1,971 2,148Japanese exports to United States   ... 826 914Japanese imports from United States 625 654Japanese exports to China ...          ... 373 346Japanese imports from China          ... 234 209Japanese exports to British India  ... 146 198Japanese imports from British India 285 288Japanese exports to Great Britain ... 58 63Japanese imports from Great Britain 164 153The United States of America, controlling about 40 per cent, of Japan&apos;s foreign trade, holds a weapon mightier than the army and navy of Japan. But would she ever consent to use it? and would the Government of India (Japan&apos;s third most formidable customer) support her policy ? Would the embargo produce an immediate collapse of Japan&apos;s offensive power? Would the collapse, unless immediate and complete, avert the danger of the situation ?Conclusions.The above considerations will have shown that the success of our Far Eastern policy and the prosperity of our economic interests are largely dependent on Japanese goodwill. It is for that reason that we have always attached the highest importance to friendly relations with Japan. It has not always been easy to co-o])erate with her, but that has been the avowed policy of both Governments, and on the whole we have succeeded fairly well. She has now and then paid attention to our advice. When her fever fit is over, it is to us that she may look for guidance, if only because of habit and the &quot; traditional friendship,&quot; unless by then we have definitely passed over into the camp of the enemy in[6563] b 3
Gwhich case, we will find that this people, who have made a cult of revenge, will know how to pay off old scores.The present situation in Manchuria, observed solely from the standpoint of British interests, need not distress us. On the contrary, the more Manchuria develops under Japanese control, the greater will be the opportunity for trade, provided that the &quot; door &quot; remains open, as Japan has promised it will. The bombardment of Chapei if it remains an isolated episode will cause temporary and local dislocation to trade, of which British interests must bear their share. In the immediate future, if things do not go from bad to worse, as trade revives, Chinese hatred for Japan (whether an avowed boycott be permitted or not), may tend to divert a certain amount of trade in our direction. At the same time, Japanese action may benefit us in inspiring into the Chinese some respect for foreigners rights. This, however, is doubtful. There is a danger lest anti-Japanese feeling in China take a general anti-foreign turn, with a revival of Soviet influence. This would imperil British communities and property throughout China.If, however, the present position succeeds in recovering some degree of equilibrium, without ourselves being compelled by unforeseen circumstances to assume a very definite attitude for or against Japan, we may regard what has happened with comparative equanimity. But I am quite aware that at any moment the development of this very dangerous situation may force our hand. A genuine desire to maintain friendship with Japan does not blind me to the fact that we may be dragged by events along a path which may end in war with her.But I maintain that from a material point of view we have nothing to gain and much to lose by antagonising Japan; and to associate ourselves in pressure from America would definitely have this effect. If America were to put an embargo on Japanese trade, we should be pressed to follow suit and not only we in the United Kingdom, but the Dominions and India, all of whom have very special trading relations with Japan, affecting their most important products. If this policy of embargo were feasible (which I doubt) the result would be a definite breaking off of diplomatic relations, which&apos; might well prove disastrous to our interests in the Far East.It must further be remembered that the policy of the United States of America in China (as elsewhere) has been erratic and inconsiderate in the past (e.g.. obstruction at the Peking Tariff Conference (1925), withdrawal of co-operation after Nanking outrages (1927), anticipation of tariff concessions (1928) ). The United States Government is quite capable of backing out after we had agreed to give our support, leaving us to clear up the resultant mess.Of course, I fully realise that our relations with the United States as regards Europe are of paramount importance. If a solution of European problems could be found along the line of a close association with America throughout the present crises, then there might be something to be said for risking our Far Eastern interests, which by comparison are of far less importance. But is any such close and thorough-going association within sight ? Is it not much more likely that we shall fall between two stools-America leaving us in the lurch in Europe, with our Far Eastern interests sacrificed for nothing?Incidents may, of course, occur which on their merits call for identical action on our part and on that of America. This, however, is quite a different matter. The danger, as I see it, lies in a definite Anglo-American anti-Japanese attitude especially if it were realised that we were acting at the bidding of America in order to suit our interests elsewhere. Such an attitude would be regarded by Japan as abandonment by her old ally; it would be attended by the consequences to be expected from such a conviction.V. W.Foreign Of/ice, February 1, 1932.
II. Memorandum by Sir J. Pratt.-Japanese Action at Shanghai.For the last four months, ever since the Japanese attack upon the Chinese in Manchuria there has been a severe boycott of Japanese trade all over China. To a considerable extent this was a natural and spontaneous movement on the part of the people, but there is also no doubt that the boycott was encouraged, subsidised and to some extent organised by the Chinese Government, and still more by the Kuomintang or Nationalist party, from which the Government derives its authority. Anti-Japanese associations were allowed to carry on their activities unchecked and though many of these activities were clearly illegal such as the confiscation of goods of Japanese origin, the fining and imprisonment of merchants trading in Japanese goods, &amp;c. the Chinese courts, including those established in the International Settlement, refused to convict persons charged with such offences. Though precise figures are not yet available it is certain that, as some 15 to 20 per cent, of Japan&apos;s foreign trade is done with China, the losses caused by the boycott have been very severe.Japan has made many complaints and representations both to China and the League on the subject of the boycott. On the 18th January last, five Japanese, including two priests, were assaulted by a mob in Chapei a densely-crowded Chinese suburb abjoining the northern&apos; boundary of the Inter-national Settlement. Two of them were severely injured. Two days later a Japanese mob burned down a Chinese factory, whose workmen were responsible for the assault. On their way back through the International Settlement they attacked Chinese members of the Settlement police, of whom several were wounded .and one killed. Next day, the 19th January, the Japanese mob created further disturbances in the International Settlement.The Japanese authorities appear to have made up their minds that the assault on the five Japanese on the 18th January provided a good opportunity for suppressing once and for all the boycott which was doing them so much injury. On the 21st January the Japanese consul-general presented four demands to the Chinese authorities, viz. : (1) apology; (2) punishment; (3) compensation; and (4) suppression of the anti-Japanese organisations and a proclamation to that effect. At the same time naval reinforcements were sent to Shanghai and the Japanese admiral announced that.drastic measures would be taken if the demands were not complied with.The Mayor of Shanghai was willing to comply with the first three of the Japanese demands, but the fourth naturally presented considerable difficulties. On the 27th January it was learned that the Japanese consul-general at Shanghai had sought authority from Tokyo to deliver an ultimatum to the mayor expiring :at midnight next day. On the 28th January the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs replied to the effect that he did not consider the moment for an ultimatum with so short a time limit as opportune, but gave the consul-general discretion, if he were not convinced of the sincerity of the mayor, to deliver an ultimatum eventually. The consul-general had. however, already on the previous day on his own responsibility delivered a twenty-four hours&apos; ultimatum, expiring at 6 p.m. on the 28th January. Throughout the 27th January negotiations continued without success between the mayor and the Japanese consul-general regarding the exact wording of the Chinese reply to the Japanese demands. The mayor published an order of the Public Safety Bureau for the immediate abolition of the anti-Japanese boycott association, and asked the Chinese community for their support in his action. In spite of the recalcitrant attitude of the military and the students agreement was reached on the 28th January between the mayor and the Japanese consul-general. The latter informed the consular body on the afternoon of the 28th January that an entirely satisfactory reply had been received from the mayor and that no action was contemplated for the time being. A similar message was communicated to Mr. Ingram at Nanking and there seemed every reason to believe that the immediate crisis had passed. In view of the fact, however, that the ultimatum was due to expire at 6 p.m., and that-drastic action by the Japanese forces had been expected not later than the 29th January, the Municipal Council of the International Settlement had proclaimed that a state of emergency would exist as from 4 p.m. on the 28th January.   The issue of this proclamation meant that certain arrangements
automatically came into effect. The volunteers were mobilised and the various units of the defence forces of the settlement volunteers and regulars, British, French, American, Japanese, &amp;c. took up each their allotted sector on the line drawn round the settlement. The main object of this measure is to prevent a flood of refugees from the adjacent Chinese areas seeking safety in the settlement and. in particular, to prevent any possible inrush of a disorderly rabble of Chinese soldiers. At some points this defence line goes well beyond settlement limits so as to include areas inhabited mainly by foreigners. The sector allotted to the Japanese is that adjacent to the crowded Chinese suburb Chapei, in the neighbourhood of which live the majority of the Japanese residents of Shanghai. Unfortunately this is the most difficult sector of all, for at some places the line of barbed wire runs down the middle of a narrow7 street and it appears that in Chapei were a large number of ill-conditioned Cantonese troops under no proper control. While the Japanese forces were taking up their positions on this line a clash occurred and the Japanese immediately launched a savage attack on Chapei.The first accounts that reached us of this affair seemed to indicate that the clash might have been an accident caused as much by the presence of ill-disciplined Chinese soldiers as by any act of the Japanese forces. In fact, however, it is now clear that the clash was the inevitable consequence of the provocative manner in which the Japanese occupied their part of the line. The Japanese sector was not exactly defined beforehand, and the line which the Japanese decided to occupy included territory beyond the boundary of the International Settlement. The Japanese forces started at midnight to occupy this line with aeroplanes dropping flares to frighten the opposition. The Chinese naturally thought that the Japanese were advancing to capture the city and put up a stout resistance, causing many Japanese casualties. The Japanese then resorted to bombing to destroy an armoured train from which they were being sniped and also in order to strike terror into the Chinese population. Bombs were dropped on an open and densely-crowded Chinese town, killing large numbers of non-combatants. Some of the reports speak of thousands of casualties. Great damage seems to have been inflicted on the railway in which British bondholders have a large financial interest. The station itself was burnt down and bridges, &amp;c, destroyed. Fires are still raging in Chapei. Several bombs fell in the International Settlement and French Concession causing damage and loss of life. That all this destruction was deliberately intended is proved by the remarks made by the Japanese admiral to His Majesty&apos;s consul-general on the 29th January. He said that he had two more aircraft carriers shortly arriving carrying forty large bombers, and that if the Chinese continued to attack him he would destroy them utterly.The trouble at Shanghai arises directly out of the trouble in Manchuria, but the action taken by the Japanese at Shanghai faces us with a set of considerations of a different order to those which were raised by Japanese action in Manchuria. In Manchuria the Japanese, as regards the fundamental issues at stake, had a great deal of right on their side. The Chinese were almost entirely in the wrong. By their corruption, incapacity and blind conceit they were reducing to ruin one of the wealthiest regions in the world, thus going a long way towards undoing the good work of the Japanese who had made prosperity possible by keeping Manchuria free from civil war. They ignored both Japaifs treaty rights and the historical justification for Japan&apos;s position in Manchuria. They regarded the policy of patience and conciliation pursued by Japan for a number of years as a sign of weakness, and met Japan&apos;s efforts to reach a working agreement on the railway question the most fundamental of all the questions at issue with an exasperating policy of evasion and procrastination. Eventually, when Japan took drastic action and drove the Chinese Government out of Manchuria, sympathy all over the world was generally on the side of Japan. It was felt that fundamentally right was on her side and that it was-better that Manchuria should be well governed under Japanese auspices than ruined by Chinese militarists. Apart from our obligations as a member of the League of Nations, there seemed to be no reason why we should intervene in these developments in Manchuria either from the point of view of the interests of civilisation in general, or from that of British interests in particular. Even from the League of Nations point of view it cannot be said that there was a good case for intervention. The absence of any real central authority either in China, or Manchuria was no unusual phenomenon.   It resulted from the characteristic peculiar to all Chinese Govern-
merits that authority was disseminated among a number of different organisa-tions and individuals struggling for power, sometimes peacefully and sometimes with violence. The peculiar position of Japan in Manchuria constituted her, in fact, one of the several competing elements among whom authority was shared. Her action was, therefore, different from the ordinary case of aggression where the forces of one State violate the national frontiers of another State, and approximated rather to the civil wars which have raged in China for the past twenty years, and which unfortunately lie beyond the scope of the League &apos;s authority.None of these considerations apply to the situation produced by the Japanese action at Shanghai. The boycott is the only weapon that China possesses. The increasing friction between China and Japan had given rise to a boycott several months before the Manchurian incident of the 18th September. A great intensi-fication of the boycott after that incident was the natural and inevitable reaction to Japan&apos;s forcible action in Manchuria. There is nothing illegal in a boycott per se. The manner in which the Chinese Government and the Kuomintang encouraged and organised the boycott involved illegal acts and violations of treaty rights, but it cannot be admitted that the conduct of the Chinese Government  perverse in many respects though it may have been could justify the use of force to suppress the boycott. Much less can it be admitted that there is anything to justify or excuse the barbarity of the methods actually adopted by the Japanese forces. Apart altogether from the question of-the British interests involved it would be difficult for us to treat the affair as being no concern of ours.It is possible that in some respects British interests may stand to gain from recent events in Manchuria and Shanghai. It is said that force is the only argu-ment which the Chinese understand and the disaster which their exasperating tactics have led them into may make them more amenable to reason in future. This argument is of doubtful validity. It is, however, probable that the trade which Japan loses may come to England. Against this we have to set the material damage done in Shanghai including damage to the railway in which there is a large British financial interest and the complete dislocation perhaps for a long time of all trade in the Yangtze Valley. If we antagonise Japan by intervening against her in any way the effect upon British interests in the Far East may be very serious, as I shall presently attempt to show. Against this, however, must be balanced the fact that if we stand aside and leave Japan to work her will unchecked upon China British commercial interests may suffer severely from Japanese arrogance and Chinese xenophobia. A Far East where Japan was dominant and supreme and also perhaps contemptuous of Great Britain would not be a favourable sphere for the development of British trade and industry. Even if it were legitimate, therefore, for Great Britain to stand aside in order not to jeopardise British interests in the Far East it would be difficult in the present circumstances to make out a case for adopting that course.If Japan continues unchecked the British will have to retire altogether from the Far East. If it is decided that we must check Japan certain preliminary measures could be adopted such as rupture of diplomatic and economic relations  but in the end Japan can only be checked by force. Ultimately, we wall be faced with the alternatives of going to war with Japan or retiring from the Far East. A retirement from the Far East might be the prelude to a retirement from India.As regards the local position in Shanghai, an international Defence Force was sent to Shanghai in 1927 and has never been entirely withdrawn. The United States, Japan, Great Britain and other Powers have each kept a small force in the International Settlement ever since, and each of these Powers is entirely within their rights in strengthening or reducing their forces as they please. Japanese troops therefore have just as much right to be in the settlement and to join in defence schemes as the British or American forces, and we cannot raise any question on that head. On the 28th January we protested against the contemplated use of force against Chinese in the International Settlement, and on the 29th January Ave demanded an explanation of the apparently unprovoked attack upon the Chinese in Chapei and protested against action which gravely endangered foreign life and property. If, as is probable, the Japanese ignore or evade all protests and representations and renew their attacks upon the Chinese we shall have to consider whether there are any steps that we can or should take
to follow up these protests. We may, for example, be asked at short notice whether we would join America in severing economic relations with Japan. The loss of her American trade would hit Japan very hard, but as far as the British Empire is concerned, the severance of relations might hurt us more than Japan, and Japan would actually gain by the repudiation of the loans raised on the London market. Japan&apos;s commercial relations with India are more important to her than those with Great Britain, but the question whether India also should sever economic relations is obviously one of great difficulty and delicacy.If America and Great Britain severed diplomatic and economic relations with Japan she would proceed to settle accounts with China in her own way, and in the process it is safe to assume that she would show her contempt for our gesture of disapproval by riding rough-shod over all British interests in the Far East. Without resorting to illegal means, she could oust British control from the International Settlement at Shanghai, and she might then turn the settlement into an annexe to a new Japanese concession extorted from China. By putting the screw on China she could exclude British vessels from the coasting trade and British interests from the railways, and generally she could establish such conditions as to make it impossible for British banks, insurance companies or merchants to carry on. Once embarked upon this course, Japan would end by leaving the League and turning her back upon all Western ideas, and, unless we were prepared to withdraw altogether from the Far East, it might be difficult to escape eventually being drawn into war. Nevertheless, if we try to avoid this fatal path by protesting and doing nothing more the consequences may yet be much the same. Japan would ti*eat our protests with increasing contempt, and eventually we would be faced with the same alternatives.There is, of course, the possibility of the economic collapse of Japan under the combined effect of the Chinese boycott and the Anglo-American severance of relations. Japan is so dependent on her American trade that America might almost make such a collapse a certainty, but it must remain a matter for speculation whether the collapse would be so immediate or so complete as to avert the dangers referred to above.J.
