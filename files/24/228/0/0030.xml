IS DOCmffiNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS, BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3: GO vTDRIMBNT.CABINET. Copy No.  .. f?. .7-.80  (52). INTERNATIOIvAL    CONVENTION    ON    HOURS_OFWORK    IN   COMMERCE   AND    OFFICES.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.      This Convention, which was adopted by the International Labour Conference in June, 19,30, fixes a 48 hour working week for persons employed in all kinds of commercial and trading establishments and in those administrative services where the employees are mainly engaged in office work.      It also applies to persons employed in clerical and similar work in hospitals and institutions, hotels,  restaurants, boarding houses and clubs,  and also in theatres and places of public amusement.      Permanent exceptions may be allowed for persons engaged in public adminis-tration and for persons occupying positions of management or employed in a confidential capacity.      Temporary exceptions may be granted in cases of accident, to deal with urgent work, to prevent loss of perishable goods, or to avoid endangering technical results and also for stocktaking and preparation of balance sheets and to deal with abnormal pressure of work.2.      At both the Sessions of the International Labour Conference (in 1929 and 1930)   at which this subject was dealt with the Representatives of the late Labour Government tock the view that to include within the scope of a single international instrument a wide range of miscellaneous occupations with widely varying conditions of employment could not be expected to produce effective international results.
5.      The International Labour Conference, however, rejected the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government and adopted the International Convention now under consideration.    It also adopted three Recommendations providing for enquiries and reports from the various States Members to the International Labour Office on conditions of employment in hotels and restaurants,  theatres and other places of public amusement and in hospitals, mental institutions etc.    The texts cf all these have been presented to Parliament in Cmd.  36S3 of 1930c4tt      In May of last year the Government cf the day d ecided not to ratify the Convention nor to accept the Recommendations and the reasons for This course were presented to Parliament in a White Paper (Cmd*  3874 of 1931)0      Briefly they were that satisfactory regulation of the hours of work of these classes of workers could only bo accomplished as a result of detailed investigation of the existing position In the various countries and that the Draft Convention covered too wide a field and permitted such a variety of exceptions as to render it unsuitable as a basis for international regulation.    The Recommendations v/ere inacceptable because they postulated acceptance of the provisions of the Convention for the workers concerned before any attempt had been made to elicit the facts,,50      On the 23rd June, 1931,  the Home Secretary end the Minister of Labour received a deputation from the Trade Union Congress which while pressing the Government to ratify the Convention handed in a list of amendments which they would have liked to see made to it, an indication that the Trade Union Congress itself is not satisfied with the Conventions provisions,, Amendments can cf course only be introduced, into these Draft
.   242Conventions by submitting the Convention again to the Inter-  ^ national Labour Conference as the final step in a rather cumbrous and complicated procedure.    The Deputation was told that the White laper represented the settled policy of the Government and that there was no question of revising it.6.      I see no reason why we should depart in any way from the attitude taken up by our predecessors towards this Convention,, and its accompanying Recommendations, but I have recentljr received a letter from the Trades Union Congress General Council urging the ratification of the Convention and calling my attention to a resolution adopted in this sense at the Trades Union Congress last year.    In replying to this letter I ought to be in a position to state the formal decision of the Government in this matter,,70      I therefore ask authority to tell the Trades Union Congress General Council that for the reasons set out in the 7/hite Paper referred to  above the present Government has decided not to ratify the Convention nor to accept the Recommendations in question.(Intld.) H.B019th February, 1932,3
