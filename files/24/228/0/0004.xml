Note &quot;by the P&quot;resident of the Board of Trade.I circulate to my colleagues the attached memorandum on Export Credits by the Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade.w.r.Board of Trade,.2nd February, 1932.
9 n&amp; iEXPORT CREDITS.Memorandum by the Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade.For the most part the Bills guaranteed by the Treasury under the Export Credits Guarantee scheme are short-term Bills, but prior to October 1931, the Treasury had authorised the Export Credits Guarantee Department to guarantee Bills from three to five years in suitable cases, provided that(a) No attempt should be made to finance in thisway transactions which would more properly be financed by market issues to the investing public.(b) The bills outstanding on account of suchguarantees should not at any time exceed  2 million.(c) The five year period should be regarded as amaximum and the Committee should endeavour to limit the guarantee normally to not more than 3 years.(d) Guarantees of this kind should be limited totransactions covering machinery, locomotives and engineering works, and, with the consentof the Board of Trade, shipbuilding.In October last the Cabinet decided that on completionof the programme of orders to be placed by the SovietGovernment with the heavy engineering industry on the basisof guarantees covering 24 months from the date of shipment,the Export Credits Guarantee Department should give nofurther guarantees for any country covering credits in excessof 12 months from the date of shipment.(2) The special programme of Russian orders is now on thepoint of completion and the Export Credits guarantee department will therefore shortly be debarred fromguaranteeing payment for exports sold to any country oncredits of more than one year,-1-
(3) The decision of October last was taken by the late National Government under the immediate influence of the depreciation of the pound sterling, as a measure of prudence until the financial s situation should have been more thoroughly examined, and in particular until the question of British trade with Russia had been considered.(4) The Cabinet Committee is considering the question of trade with Russia, but in the meantime I desire to obtain the authority of the Cabinet to revert to the arrangements in force prior to October last as regards export credits to countries other than Russia.   The MacMillan Report (paragraph 395) emphasised the importance of adequate medium term credit facilities being available to cover s ales abroad, and in the interests of trade and industry I am very anxious that the facilities for obtaining the Treasury guarantee in respect of export credits for from three to five years^should again be made available.(5) The only difficulty that may arise is in connection with credits -for Russia.    The Cabinet Committee which is now considering the question   of trade with Russia has under consideration the possibility of granting credits of more than 12 months to Russia under the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme on the basis of some security.  In arriving at our recommendations my colleagues on this Committee and I will have to pay attention to the Temporary Commercial Agreement with the Soviet Union, the Protocol of which provides in -effect that trade with Soviet Russia shall be eligible for consideration for Export Credits on the same basis as trade with any other country.    The Protocol continues to define this by saying &quot;that is to say,  that in considering any given transaction regard shall be had to financial and commercial considerations only&quot;.
(6) This question should not, however, present any very great difficulty since I understand that in practice it is unusual for any credits of more than 12 months to he granted by the Export Credits Guarantee Department to countries other than Russia except against some form of security approved by the Committee in each case.      It may therefore be safely left to the Advisory Committee to the Export Credits Guarantee Department to justify on the financial and commercial considerations mentioned in the Protocol any action that it may take in attaching conditions to the grant of credits of more than 12 months to Hussia or to any other country.(7) I recommend therefore that the Export Credits Guarantee Advisory Committee should be free as in the past to consider proposals involving credit of more than 12 months subject, insofar as Hussia is concerned, to any decision which the Cabinet may take on the recommendations of the Cabinet   Committee on trade with   Russia.JOHN COLVILLE.2nd February, 1932.
