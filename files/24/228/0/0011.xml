(THIS DOCUMENT. IS THS PROPERTY OF, HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^. &amp;^ZSk^EN?) SECRET.CP.  61 (33),COPY NO.G&apos;A B INS T.COMMITTEE, ON TRADE WITH RUSSIA,.-INTERIM REPORT.I.       At their Meeting on January 27th 1932 (Cabinet 9 (32) Conclusion 7), the Cabinet considered the supplementary recommendation in regard to Trade with Russia contained in the Roport (CP, 25 (32))  of the Committee on the Balance of Trade., and after hearing a statement from the Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs on the present eituation7 agreed that a Cabinet Committee composed ofThe Chancellor of the Exchequer      (in the Chair) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs The Secretary of State for the Coloniea The President of the Board of Tradeand   The Par 11 amenta^ Secretary to the Departmentof Overseas Trade.,should consider the subject of Trade with Russia In the lightof its bearing on the adverse balance of tradee     We have not3ret completed our examination of the question, but we havereached the fol3.owing conclusionsaoposed So      (l) V/e have decided to invite the Foreign Office gotiationsth the forthwith to enter into negotiations with thevietbassador in Soviet Ambassador in London^ on the following a&amp;bn.n o o o %ilines
The Ambassador should he told that His Majesty?s Government feel considerable anxiety at the present state of Anglo-Russian Trade, that the importn from Russia amount to nearly four times the value of British exports to Russia, and that even with the most generous allowance for invisible British exports, the balance    is such as to cause anxiety,,      The Ambassador should be asked -whether his Government have, any suggestion for remedying this state of affairs, and should be told that in view of the very large sterling balances which presumably mjsst be available in this country, it should be an easy matter for the Soviet Government to give us satisfaction without delay0      He should also be told that His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that they cannot for long acquiesce in the present state of affairs 5 and that if it continues they will   be forced to consider seriously the question of taking steps to attain the end desired.In the discussions with the Soviet Ambassador, no reference should be made., at the present stage, to possible denunciation of the Trade Agreement,Better (2) We are advised that -if the Cabinet decision of lastsecurity for future October (under which future credits are reduced to acredits,,maximum period of one year) is maintained, Russian purchases in this country will diminish to a very small figures    In fact practically no Russian orders have been placed In the United Kingdom on these shorter terms since the decision was taken,.      It has been suggested to us that the Export Credits Guarantee Committee might be authorised to continue to guarantee credits up to two years, but at the same time refuse to guarantee any further credits in excess of one year., except on condition that the Russian Government deposited approved security -preferably in the form of. sterling balances - to cover a proportion of all future credits&quot; for more than twelve monthsn      If this plan was adopted we should both diminish the margin of risk involved in2o
these credits and improve the effect on the exchanges.    We could therefore continue to give a certain amount of credit and this fact, combined with the reduction in sterling prices in terms of gold.,and the financial difficulties of Germany, might enable us to secure an increased volume of Russian orders at a diminished risk.     We have invited the Export Credits Guarantee Committee to sound the Russian Trade Delegation on the possibility of obtaining security for further guarantees covering credits in excess of twelve months on the general lines of the ahove proposal, and to report to us the result of such discussion0(3)    We recommend the Cabinet to approve the action taken by the Committee,    When the results of these discussions are available, we propose to submit a further Report to the GabinctoSigned on behalf of the Committee No  CHAj IBERLAIN. * CHAIRMANaWhitehall Gardens, SoW.l0 ^w/pebruary, 1952.
