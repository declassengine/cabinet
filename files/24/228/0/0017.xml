Note fry the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on the 3rd February (Cabinet 11 (32) Conclusion 3), I have re-drafted the proposed statement on agricultural and fisheries policy, and I now circulate the revised draft for consideration at the next meeting of the Cabinet.(Intld.)    J.G.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 9 th february-ry, 1932.
Proposed Statement on Agricultural and Fisheries Policy.1. At the present time practically the whole of agriculturelike the whole of industry is suffering from the effects of the general fall of commodity prices which has been experienced with such severity since the autumn of 1929.2. The branch of agriculture which has suffered most fromthe fall in prices is wheat growing, and the Government propose to assist growers of this crop by means of a quota scheme which will provide them with a guaranteed market and an enhanced price for wheat of millable quality.    Full details of this scheme will be available to the House shortly when the Bill dealing with the matter is introduced.3. The Government attach great importance to a long-rangepolicy, but immediate action is necessary, and accordingly, with the exception of wheat, wool and meat, all agricultural and horticultural produce has been included within the scope of the Import Duties Bill now before the H*use. 4. Under that Bill as introduced ail agricultural and horticultural products, with the exceptions I have referred to and of produce already chargeable with a Customs Duty, will be subject to the general tariff of 10 per cent, ad valorem, or its equivalent in specific duties.    An additional Customs Duty may be imposed on any particular product if recommended by the Import Duties Advisory Committee provided for in this Bill, and in this connection malting barley and certain horticultural products will receive particular attention.5. The administrative feasibiHty of levying an additionalCustoms duty on malting barley is being examined with a view to this question being referred to the Import Duties Advisory Committee at the earliest possible date if a pra.ctioable scheme
for differentiating at the port between malting barley and feeding barley can be evolved.   The alternative method of a quota is also under consideration.6. The Import Duties Advisory Committee will also be askedto recommend what duties should be imposed on the commodities at present covered by the Horticultural Products (Emergency Customs Duties) Act, 1931, when duties under that Act expire. 7.       The foregoing proposals refer to immediate action.   The G-overnment1 s long-range policy is designed to facilitate economic development in those branches of the agricultural industry which are likely to be the most remunerative, and particularly those which lend themselves to most rapid development.8.       In regard to milk and milk products the Government aim particularly at the improvement of marketing and have decided to set up a Reorganisation Commission under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931, with a view to the formulation of a scheme. They will also investigate the means of securing a reduction of disease among dairy herds.    Imports of milk and milk products are being dealt with under the Import Duties Bill. 9.       With regard to bacon the preparation of a scheme for the organisation of the bacon industry will be undertaken forthwith, and, provided a satisfactory scheme is evolved, the Government is prepared to adopt some form of quantitative regulation of import s.10.     The Government also undertake to appoint a Re-organisatIon Commission, if desired by potato growers, with instructions to prepare a scheme for the organisation and marketing of the home potato crop and to consider such practicable complementary action as may appear to be necessary for the regulation of imports of main crop potatoes.
11.       The Government also intend,  aa far as financial circumstances permit, to maintain and develop agricultural education and research and to continue the National Mark movement and the policy of land settlement.12.       While the Government do not propose to make any change in the present system of regulating agricultural wages they are fully alive to the necessity of securing observance of the Orders made under the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act, and they wish to call the attention of agricultural workers to the facilities which exist for the investigation by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of complaints that the requirements of these Orders are not being observed.Fisheries.13.       Immediate help to the Fishing Industry will be afforded by the Customs Duties proposed in the Import Duties Bill. Further action which may be necessary in connection with the Fishing Industry will be taken after full consideration has been given to the Report of the Economic Advisory Council on the Fishing Industry which has just been presented to Parliament.General.14. Obviously the future of any industry must depend largely on its own efforts^ to adapt its methods of production and marketing to modern conditions, and it is believed that the Government^ policy will do much to restore confidence and stimulate endeavour in the two great industries of agriculture and fisheries, which play so important a part in the economic life of the nation.
