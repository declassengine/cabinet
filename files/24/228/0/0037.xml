Copy No.    9CP. 87 (32)CABINET.THE NEW HEBRIDES.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and. the Secretary of State for the Colonies.WE have recently had under consideration the question of the future of the New Hebrides Condominium.I. Introductory Statement.2. The New Hebrides Islands, including the Banks and Torres Islands, have an area of about 5,700 square miles, distributed over about eighty islands, some thirty of which are uninhabited. The estimated population is 66,000 (about 60,000 natives and 6,000 non-natives). The non-native population includes 219 British, 931 French, 4,943 French protected persons (mostly Tonkinese), 41 foreigners who have opted for the British regime, and 87 foreigners who have opted for the French regime.3. By a Convention of 1906, since superseded by a Convention of 1914, the New Hebrides were constituted a British-French Condominium. Previously there had been a Joint Naval Commission charged with the protection of the lives and properties of British and French nationals.4. About 1920 the French Government decided to help the French settlers by introducing Javanese and Tonkinese labourers. The British settlers appealed for Chinese labour, but this has been denied them. As a consequence of the unequal competition, the French position in the Group has progressively improved while the British position has correspondingly deteriorated; and the character of the Group may now be said to be predominantly French.5. There are three distinct administrative Services in the Group : (a) The Condominium Service, i.e., the proclaimed joint services which are under the joint control of the British and French Resident Commissioners. This Service is financed by revenue raised from local taxation; and in the event of the local revenue proving insufficient to meet the expenditure the United Kingdom and Jbrench Governments are each responsible for a moiety of the deficit. Between 1921 and 1930 the expenditure on the joint Services was kept within the revenue-and a small reserve fund was built up. Since then, however, the reserve fund has been exhausted and financial assistance has had to be provided by the two Governments. About  5,000 is likely to be required from each Government during 1932.(b) The exclusively British Services, the cost of which falls entirely upon United Kingdom funds.   The latest expenditure figures are as follows :  1929-30        ... ... ... ...        9,5061930-31        ... ... ... ...      10,3141931-32        ... ... ... ...      10,055 (estimated).1932-33        ... ... ... ...      10,500 (estimated).[6669] b
(c) The exclusively French Services, which are financed from French sources. The latest expenditure figures (converted at the local rate of 124 francs to the   sterling) are as follows :  1930 ... ... ... ...      32,8931931 ... ... ... ...      60,8701932 ... ... ... ....      53,700 (estimated).II. Recent Decisions as to Policy (1930-31).6. The whole question was discussed at the 1930 Imperial Conference.7. The Conference appointed a Committee consisting of representatives of the United Kingdom, Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments, to consider and report upon the rjosition in the Group. It was ascertained by the Committee that neither the Commonwealth nor the New Zealand Government were prepared to assume responsibility for the administration of the British share of the Condominium, and the following possible courses of action were examined : (i) Continuance of the Condominium and the maintenance of the British share in it without any special steps to improve the British position; (ii) Continuance of the Condominium coupled with efforts to improve the British position in the Group;(iii) Partition of the Group between the United Kingdom and french governments;(iv) Mandate suggestions (a) Partition of the Group under two Mandates one British and oneFrench.(b) Acceptance by France of a Mandate over the whole Group;(v) British withdrawal from the Group in favour of France.8. The Committee recommended &quot; that, in view of the progressive diminution in British interests in the New Hebrides, negotiations be opened with the French Government for the withdrawal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom from the Condominium, subject to essential guarantees for the protection of missionary and other British interests, in return for territorial compensation elsewhere, or, failing this, on the best terms obtainable.&quot;9. After considering the Report of the Committee, the Imperial Conference came to the following conclusions : (a) That the Foreign Office should be invited to open negotiations with theFrench Government for the withdrawal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom from the Condominium, subject to essential guarantees for the protection of missionary and other British interests on the lines recommended in the Report (i.e., the Committee&apos;s Report).(b) That the Dominions concerned should be kept in touch with the progressof the negotiations.-10. In January 1931 an Inter-Departmental Committee was set up to prepare the way for the proposed approach to the French Government. The Report of this Committee is annexed to this Memorandum.111. Presen t Post tion.11. The next step would normally have been to consult the Commonwealth and Newr Zealand Governments on the Committee&apos;s Report. Action on this point, however, was stayed on account of the attitude of the Foreign Office. In October 1931 the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Reading) held that there would not be the remotest chance of obtaining any compensation from France in return for a British withdrawal from the Condominium, and that it would be &quot; futile and humiliating &quot; to attempt negotiations with them for the purpose. He suggested that it should be explained to the two Dominion Governments that the conclusions of the Imperial Conference could not be
implemented at present. We understand that this view is shared by the present Foreign Secretary, and we are of a like opinion.12. A recent report from the High Commissioner indicates that the British position in the New Hebrides is now becoming critical, even from the purely administrative aspect. He avers that the joint administration does not function, except in name, outside the headquarters island, that the French are deliberately pursuing a policy of converting the Group into a French Colony, and that for all practical purposes France already exercises separate authority over some parts. Generally, he considers that the Group is being inadequately administered, and that the difficulties regarding Condominium finance are being exploited by the French to their fullest advantage.iv. Special considerations to be borne in mind.13. Whilst the prospects of an acceptable deal with France over the New Hebrides at our instigation are less now than in 1930, in our opinion a British departure from the New Hebrides without a reasonable quid pro quo would be a severe blow to British prestige, which in present circumstances it would be specially undesirable to incur. We recognise that the conclusions of the Imperial Conference should be acted upon as soon as the time is opportune, and that during any postponement of negotiations with France the British standing in the Group may weaken still further. But on the other hand we have also to reckon with the French knowledge of our present financial difficulties, which places them in a position to drive a hard bargain. Despite anything our negotiator might plead to the contrary, the French Government would soon read into any approach from our side that we were intent upon going out; and their attitude might stiffen accordingly.14. Moreover, since the Condominium is not at present paying its own way, we might expose ourselves to the suspicion of seeking to abandon our contractual responsibilities in the Group at a period when it most required the aid of the partner Governments, and at the same time expecting compensation from the French Government for the added responsibilities to be placed upon them.15. It is necessary to carry Australia and New Zealand with us in the policy to be adopted, for three reasons :  (a) They   are   substantially   interested   in   the   future   of   the   Group.Australian and New Zealand Missions are established there. The Commonwealth Government also subsidises a line of steamers between Australia and the New Hebrides, and is otherwise interested in the trade of the Group. The Commonwealth Government also has an interest in land, and maintains a Solicitor in the Group;(b) For several years we have made it our practice to act in consultationwith the two Governments when important questions of policy affecting the future of the Group have been under consideration; and(c) The conclusions of the Imperial Conference which it is in contemplationto vary were specifically agreed to by their representatives at the Conference.v. Policy now Proposed.16. Our suggestion is that the policy of an approach to France be postponed for a period of, say, two years, unless anything should happen in the meantime which would appear to favour an earlier reopening of the matter. By the beginning of 1934 it is possible that the Condominium may again become self-supporting.17. It would be essential that the two Dominion Governments should be informed of the intention to postpone action, and that they should be apprised of those portions of the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee which affect the interests of Australia and of New Zealand. It has to be remembered that at any moment a favourable opportunity might occur for combining the New HebriVles question with other negotiations with France.18. If it be agreed that the Condominium shall be continued for a further period, it will not be easy to avoid asking for funds to enable a fitting British share to be taken in the affairs of the Group, A vessel for the British Resident Commissioner is badly required, but this has had to be refused on financial [6669] b 2mm
grounds. In other ways, also, expenditure has been closely pruned, and, we fear, to a level which must give rise to the impression that the British interest in the Group is a diminishing&quot; one. However, in present circumstances, we are prepared for the recent policy of rigid retrenchment, both as regards the joint services and the exclusively British services, to be continued for the immediate future, despite the discreditable starving of services which it entails. At the same time, it should be remembered that we may be criticised by the missionaries for neglect of our duty, and that these criticisms may find an echo in Parliament.VI. Recapitulation of Course of Action Proposed.19. We accordingly invite our colleagues to agree (i) That, in view of the material change in circumstances since the Imperial Conference of 1930, unless a particularly opportune occasion for reopening the matter should occur sooner, the question of approaching the French Government for the purpose of terminating the British-French Condominium in the New Hebrides be postponed until early in 1934, by which time it is hoped that the joint administration may again be self-supporting; and (ii) That the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments be informed accordingly, and at the same time acquainted with the substance of the Report which forms the Annexure to this memorandum.(Initialled) J. H. T.P. C.-L.Downing Street, March 1, 1932.
Report of Inter-Departmental Committee.I. Introductory.1. AMONG the conclusions of the 1930 Imperial Conference was the following (dated the 4th November, 1930) regarding the future of the New Hebrides :  (a) That the Foreign Office should be invited to open negotiations with theFrench Government for the withdrawal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom from the Condominium, subject to essential guarantees for the protection of missionary and other British interests on the lines recommended in the Report; and(b) That the Dominions concerned should be kept in touch with the progressof the negotiations.This conclusion followed upon an examination of the present position in the Group by a Committee of the Conference, and the Report referred to at (a) above is the Report of that Committee.2.   We were appointed in January 1931 as a Committee to consider and report upon matters requiring decision before the approach to the French Government contemplated in the Imperial Conference conclusion could be made .and other subsidiary questions arising in connection with the policy decided upon.3.   The particular matters which we were requested to consider were : (a) The territorial or other compensation to be requested from the FrenchGovernment for the British withdrawal from the Group.(b) The guarantees to be demanded for the protection of (1) Natives;(2) British missionaries;(3) Other British interests, including land claims.(c) Whether any special compensation, and, if so, in what form, should beprovided for officials in the Group whose services are dispensed with as a consequence of the British withdrawal.We set out below the results of our examination of these matters and of a number of subsidiary questions which arise.II. Territorial or other Compensation to be Requested from the FrenchGovernment.4. We have been impressed with the desirability from the point of view -of prestige of endeavouring to obtain compensation from the French Govern-ment which would appear a not unreasonable quid pro qtw for the abandonment of the British share in the administration of the New Hebrides. From this point of view, territorial compensation, if it can be obtained, would be the most desirable form. We refer beknv to a number of suggestions for territorial compensation and we also discuss the basis of a possible claim for financial compensation. We think it would be well to ask for both territorial and financial compensation, but we recommend that the former should be preferred if either, but not both, could be obtained.-(i) Territorial Compensation.5. The Imperial Conference Committee mentioned three French territories which might possibly be asked for as compensation, i.e., Kerguelen Island and Adelie Land in the Antarctic region, and Bora Bora in the Society Islands, but did not attempt to place them in any order of preference.   As a result of further-enquiries which we have made, a further possibility has been suggested, viz. : Kamranh Bay, a harbour on the coast of Indo-China. This, however, we dismissed, as it seemed probable that the French Government would regard a request for it almost as an unfriendly act and would certainly not be prepared;to cede it.
GG. Advantages which would accrue from the acquisition of the three-territories mentioned by the Imperial Conference Committee are as follows:  (a) Kerguelen xIsland.-This island (Lat. 48G 30&apos; S., Long. 69Q 40&apos; E.) possesses a good harbour with fuelling facilities, and is extensively used by whaling vessels and by exploring expeditions proceeding to and from the Antarctic Continent. We are informed that, in view of the interest now being, taken in the Antarctic by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom as well as by His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand, the acquisition of the island would be of advantage from the point of view of Antarctic exploration and development.(b) Adelie Land. This is actually a portion of the Antarctic Continent., annexed by France, which forms an enclave in a sector which, it is hoped, will shortly be annexed to the Crown and placed under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia. We are informed that it is desired to establish British control over as great a portion of the Antarctic Continent as possible, and that, from this point of view,- the elimination of French interests in Adelie Land would be advantageous.(c) Bora Bora. We are informed that this island possesses a valuable harbour in a part of the Pacific where there is at present no harbour under British control. It lies on the route from Panama to New Zealand, which is used by all ships except those of very large endurance. The Air Ministry consider that it has some potential value for the development of air routes at a future date. It is understood that the Admiralty would not contemplate any development of Bora Bora harbour in peace time, but that it would probably be used for fuelling His Majesty&apos;s ships on passage across the Pacific. They consider further that its acquisition would be advantageous in view of its potential value in any war involving operations in the Pacific. As it would hardly be politic to ask for Bora Bora Island alone, it would be advisable to ask for the whole of the Western half of the Society Islands, of which Bora Bora forms a part. These islands may be defined as those within the area enclosed by the following lines : i(a) In the North bv the parallel of latitude 15Q 30&apos; S.(b) In the East by&quot; the Meridian of 150o 50&apos; W. longitude.(c) In the South by the parallel of latitude 18D 00&apos; S.(d) In the West by the Meridian of 1550 00&apos; W. longitude.Bora Bora and these neighbouring islands have a population of rather more than 5,000, and would require administration. They lie close to the Cook Islands, which are a dependency of New Zealand, and it would therefore be possible and convenient for them to be administered by New Zealand.7. In view of their strategic and potential commercial value, Bora Bora and the neighbouring islands appear to us to offer greater advantages than either Kerguelen Island or Adelie Land. Moreover, their cession in return for the British withdrawal from the New Hebrides could be regarded as territorial compensation in the same area, giving to the arrangement the appearance of a territorial adjustment in the Pacific. From the point of view of the advantages offered, and looking especially to the prestige aspect, we came to the conclusion that the territories mentioned should be asked for in the following order of&quot; preference : (i) Bora Bora and neighbouring islands, as defined above, (ii) Adelie Land and Kerguelen Island, (iii) Adelie Land, or, failing that, Kerguelen Island.8. Since Bora Bora and Adelie Land, and to a lesser extent Kerguelen Island, are predominantly interests of Australia and New Zealand, we assumed, when coming to this conclusion, that the control and any administration of Adelie Land or Kerguelen Island that might be required would be undertaken by Australia, and the control and administration of Bora Bora by New Zealand. We felt it desirable, however, that this assumption should be confirmed, and at our suggestion the views of the Governments of those two Dominions were formally invited as to both the order of preference indicated and the assumption by them of control and administration.
9. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia have intimated in reply that they concur as regards future control and in the suggested order of preference. They are of opinion, however, that all three territories together would be an inadequate exchange for the New Hebrides. If France will not consider the cession of all three territories, they consider that every effort should be made to obtain the acquisition of Bora Bora. Should France agree to cede Kerguelen Island and/or Adelie Land the Commonwealth Government will accept the administration of those territories. If it should be possible to obtain only Kerguelen Island or Adelie Land, the cession of the latter and the elimination of French influence in the Antarctic, although a most inadequate exchange, would be the more valuable to the Commonwealth.10. His Majesty&apos;s Government, in New Zealand at first replied regretting that they would not feel able to assume the responsibility for the administration of Bora Bora and the neighbouring islands. It was thereupon explained to them that the distance of the islands (which are too small to form a separate .Administration) from the nearest Group administered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would, for reasons both of administrative convenience and expense (particularly in relation to communications), make it extremely difficult for their administration to be undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, since this would involve their inclusion in the Western Pacific High Commission and their control from Suva (some 1,800 miles away). The disadvantages of attempting to administer the islands from Suva were in fact so great as to make it doubtful whether a request for cession would be justified, if that method of administration should prove to be involved. To this the New Zealand Government have replied that, while the considerations advanced by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are generally . agreeable to them, they are not at present prepared to contemplate the assumption of increased responsibilities; if, however, in the course of negotiations it became apparent that the French Government were disposed to exchange territory elsewhere in return for a British withdrawal from the New Hebrides, and that the acquisition of Bora Bora by the British might be jeopardised by the decision which the New Zealand Government have felt themselves obliged to take, they v ill be prepared to give further consideration to the matter.11. We take this, reply to mean that in the last resort the New Zealand Government would be prepared to undertake the administration of Bora Bora and the neighbouring islands, if ceded. We therefore see no reason, in the light -of the replies from the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments, to modify the conclusion we reached that the three territories should be asked for in the order of preference indicated in paragraph 7 above.12. In view of the fact that the decision to open negotiations with the French Government for the British withdrawal from the New Hebrides was, we ^understand, largely actuated by financial considerations, we think it well, before passing from this section of our Report, to call attention to the fact that, unless Bora Bora and the neighbouring islands were administered by New Zealand, their acquisition from the French would involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in considerable expenditure, both on administration and on the maintenance of communications. In this connection we annex in Appendix A a brief report upon Bora Bora and the neighbouring islands, based upon a report recently obtained from His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Tahiti.(ii) Financial Compensation.13. The suggestion has been made that the French Government should be asked to refund to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom the sums provided by the latter Government for joint services during the period of the Condominium. The New Hebrides, like most other territories, required subventions-tions in aid of local revenue in the early stages of its development, and it seems reasonable that on the termination of the Condominium the outgoing partner should be reimbursed the sums it provided for necessary assistance in those early years. There is the possibilty that a. hostile critic might represent a settlement on these lines in the light of a sale of British interests in the Group, and perhaps assert that His Majesty&apos;s Government were exacting compensation from the natives, since it would not be practicable to stipulate that the French should not
recover from local funds any payment agreed upon under this head. In spite of this, the majority of the Committee consider that financial compensation on the basis indicated might reasonably be asked for; a minority, however, prefer the alternative referred to in paragraph 42 below, namely, that the request for financial compensation in respect of joint expenditure should be restricted to a moiety of the value of such of the transferred Condominium Government properties as were acquired out of funds provided by the two Governments.14. The sums voted by Parliament to meet deficits in the Condominium budgets or expenditure on Joint services amounted tc  105,028, covering the period 1907-08 to 1920-21.* Sums were also voted by Parliament in those years for purely British services in the New Hebrides. For all these services together (provision for which was made in separate sections of the same Sub-head of the Colonial Services Estimate) the sums actually issued were much less than the sums voted, but the Colonial Office records do not show how much of the sums issued related to Condominium budget deficits or other joint expenditure. Unless,, therefore, this information could be obtained from the local records of the British Administration before the negotiations with the French were opened, it would be necessary to make the request for refund in general terms, leaving the precise-amount to be ascertained locally.(iii) Commercial Concessions.15. It has been suggested that it might be possible to obtain certain con-cessions from the French Government in commercial matters, not as a part of the compensation, but by taking advantage of this occasion, on which the British would be offering something to the French Government, to put forward the British requests. The matters referred to are the tariff treatment of certain British Colonial produce (e.g., tanning extracts) imported into France and the treatment in France of the inhabitants of British mandated territories. The former question might, we think, be borne in mind in case during the negotiations it appeared that the French were in a frame of mind in which they would be likely to make concessions, but we doubt whether any useful purpose would be served by bringing forward the latter, in this connection.III. Guarantees for the Protection of British Interests. (i) Natives.16. We were asked to consider specially whether it would be possible to&apos; include in the list of guarantees to be asked of the French Government, one to-the effect that native interests would be adequately safeguarded after the British departure. We have examined this possibility, but have found the matter one of great difficulty. It would obviously be a question of extreme delicacy to convey to the French any suggestion as to the need for such a guarantee. Moreover, the substance and form of such a guarantee would necessarily have to approximate to those of the guarantees for the protection of native interests incorporated in the text of the &quot; B &quot; or &quot; C &quot; Mandates. We understand that the New Hebrides Committee of the Imperial Conference considered the possibility of asking the French to take over the Group under a mandate, but dismissed it, stating that they felt that it was in the highest degree improbable that the French would agree to such a course.17. In these circumstances, we hesitate to suggest that the French Govern-ment should be asked to give formal guarantees in respect of the protection of native interests, as this would be only another form of the Mandate proposal. We feel that, in fact, His Majesty&apos;s Government must rely on the French of their own accord to treat the natives fairly after the British withdrawal, and that formal stipulations in detail to that effect would either be unacceptable to the French Government or would be inefficacious in practice. We see, however, no* reason why the agreement providing for the withdrawal should not include a clause placing on record the confidence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom that the French Government would carry on the administration of the Group with full regard to the best interests of the natives.* Recent telegrams indicate that, owing to the world depression, further financial assistance from the two Goverments is likely to be needed during- the current year.iiiimiiJ
18. In this connection, we also recommend that an endeavour should be made to secure that the post of Native Advocate, whose duty it is to look after the interests of natives in land cases coming before the Joint Court, should be continued in connection with the proposed special Lands Tribunal, which we suggest below should be established to expedite the hearing of British claims to land in the Group (see paragraphs 32 and 36).(ii) British Missions.19. The British Mission activities in the New Hebrides are considerable, and are important to the Australian and New Zealand Governments, as most of the Missions operate from Australia or New Zealand. We have had before us two suggestions for safeguarding the activities of these Missions : (a) A stipulation that, on the termination of the Condominium, BritishMissions should be guaranteed the same treatment as French Missions; and(b) A stipulation, following the precedent of an assurance given in January1913 by the French Government in connection with the recognition of the French Protectorate over Morocco, that British Missions should continue to enjoy the same liberty in respect of worship and charitable work as before, and that, as regards educational Avork, the French Government should consent to the maintenance of existing schools, but without giving an undertaking in regard to the opening of newr educational establishments.20. We think it would be unreasonable to press for the grant to the British Missions of a right to continue in perpetuity their present activities, wmich would amount to constituting them a kind of enclave in a French possession; and we-feel, therefore, that a guarantee for existing Missions of the same treatment as. French Missions would be all. that could properly be asked for.(iii) Undertaking not to cede to a Third Power.21. We are of opinion that it is an essential precedent to any British withdrawal from the Condominium that the French Government should be-required to give an undertaking not to cede the territory to any third Power-without the prior consent of His Majesty&quot;s Government in the United Kingdom..(iv) Naval and Military Guarantees.22. We are informed that the view of the Admiralty is that, on general grounds, it is important to prevent any development in the Group of a naval base or other naval works. They have also raised the question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is under an obligation to maintain the status quo in the Group, by virtue of Article 19 of the Washington Treaty of the 6th February, 1922, and, if so, whether it should not be stipulated that that obligation should be taken over by the French Government upon the British withdrawal.23. The Foreign Office Legal Adviser, wdio has been consulted, has advised that the position is as follows :  Article 19 of the Washington Treaty rjrovided for the maintenance of the status quo, and, so far as the British Empire is concerned, applied to* &apos;: the insular possessions which the British Empire nowr holds or may hereafter acquire in the Pacific East of the meridian 110o East Longitude.&quot;&quot; The New Hebrides, which are described in Article 1 of the 1914 Protocol as-&quot; a region of joint influence .... each of the two Powers retaining sovereignty over its nationals .... and neither exercising a separate authority over the Group,&quot; do not fall within this definition. Moreover, France is not a party to Article 19, and, in the conditions created by the Protocol, it would have been impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to accept an obligation in relation to the Newr Hebrides which was not also accepted by France. Further, the object of Article 19 was, so to speak, to demilitarise the area in question as between the United States of America, .lapan and the British Empire; and there was never any question of applying similar provisions to the French possessions in the area. For these reasons, it appears that, so far as the wording of Article 19 is concerned, His Majesty&apos;s.[6669] c&apos;
-Government in the United Kingdom are not under an obligation to the United States of America and Japan to secure that the French Government accept a provision on the same lines as part of the arrangement for the British withdrawal from the Group. Nevertheless, it is possible that, in drawing up the Washington Treaty, no steps were taken to apply Article 19 to the New Hebrides because of the existence of Article 1 (3) of the 1914 Protocol, which in effect produces the same result, and that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom withdraw from the Condominium without securing that something like the provisions of Article 1 (3) should continue to govern the Group, they may be accused, not of a breach of treaty, but of something like bad faith. It would be desirable to avoid this, and to attempt to secure the acceptance by the French of a provision which would continue the statics quo as regards fortifications and naval bases, and would in effect forbid the establishment of either. In the unlikely event of the French objecting to such a provision for the continuance of the existing position, they could be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom could not agree to its omission Avithout consultation with the United States of America and Japan.24. In view of the above expression of opinion by the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, we recommend that an undertaking should be obtained from the French Government to maintain the status quo as regards fortifications and naval bases as suggested.25. The question also arises whether an attempt should be made to secure an undertaking that the French will not organise in the Group any native military forces except for local police and local defence purposes. It appears to us that this undertaking might be asked for in addition to that relating to naval fortifications and bases, but we attach much less importance to it than to the other undertaking (which we regard as essential), and we consider that if, as is likely, the French refuse, it need not be insisted upon.(v) Commercial Guarantees.26. We have consulted the Board of Trade, and we consider that it would be desirable, if possible, to secure equality with the French in perpetuity for British nationals (including subjects and companies) and British-protected persons, British goods and British ships (including, in the case of ships, the right to participate in the coasting trade). We recognise, however, that the French Government might not agree to all this. If so, we suggest that national treatment for goods and, as a further concession, for companies, might be restricted to a period of forty years, for which period there is a precedent in the Tunis Agreement of 1897. We consider that it would be reasonable to ask for equality of treatment in perpetuity for subjects and ships, as these privileges would be little more than are usually accorded in commercial treaties. If, however, it should not be possible to obtain the concession for more than a period of forty years for subjects, this would reasonably safeguard the present generation who have established interests in the New Hebrides.(vi) Nationality.27. It appears to us highly desirable that the national status of persons born in the Group of British parents should be safeguarded. We have consulted the Home Office, and we consider that the following guarantees should be asked for in connection with the preservation of nationality rights of British subjects or British protected persons resident in the New Hebrides at the time of the termination of the Condominium : (a) French nationality shall not be imposed upon British subjects or British protected persons ordinarily resident in the New Hebrides at the date of the termination of the Condominium. (A list of these persons should be prepared and communicated to the French Government.) They shall continue to possess the property (movable and immovable) and the interests therein which they enjoy in the New Hebrides at that date. Permission to re-enter the New Hebrides shall not be withheld from any such British subject or British protected person if he is temporarily absent from the Group at the time of the termination of the Condominium or if he leaves the New Hebrides, and thereafter seeks to return there.
(b) The New Hebrides shall not be regarded as having been French territorybefore the date of the termination of the Condominium for the purpose of the application of French nationality law.(c) The same rules as to renunciation of French nationality shall apply as inFrance.28. It is possible that difficulty may arise in a few cases where British subjects have married women natives of the New Hebrides. Normally, such a marriage, if legally valid, would confer British nationality on the woman, but Article 8 (2) of the Protocol of the 6th August, 1914, declares that no native shall acquire in the Group the status of subject or citizen of either of the two-Signatory Powers. It is not thought likely, however, that the French would object on this score to such women being included as British subjects, and the-suggestion that a list should be prepared of persons to be covered is designed; to secure that possible difficulties of this sort shall be dealt with before the British withdrawal.IV. Disposal of British Land Claims.29. One of the most important British interests in the New Hebrides consists of the claims by British subjects to land. Interests in large areas of land were acquired from the natives before the setting up of the Condominium, and, as part of the organisation set up by the Condominium, a Joint Court was-established whose functions include the determination of claims to land. This Court consists of a neutral President, one British Judge and one French Judge. There is provision for a fourth officer (a neutral) to serve as Public Prosecutor, and a fifth (also a neutral) to serve as Native Advocate, and it has been agreed that there should also be a Legal Commissioner (also a neutral) who would be available to act temporarily in the absence of the President or the Public Prosecutor. At present the offices of Public Prosecutor and Legal Commissioner are vacant, but these officers are not essential for the land work of the Court.. The Court is assisted by a Registrar and other subordinate staff appointed by the President.30. Owing, inter alia, to the War and the difficulty of providing for the-survej^s which are essential to the proper determination of the claims, little progress was made in the land work until a few years ago, and a large number of claims still remain for settlement. Up to July 1930, 863 claims had been lodged, of which 470, covering an area of approximately 317 square miles, were classified as British. This question of land claims is of particular importance to the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, since not only are many of the British claimants Australians, but the Commonwealth Government itself has claims to large areas in the Island of Santo and elsewhere.31. It seems to us essential that, upon the termination of the Condominium,, arrangements should be made for the determination as speedily as possible of the outstanding British land claims; and the continuance of a tribunal on the-lines of the Joint Court appears the best method of ensuring this. Wer therefore, recommend the following course : 32. The French Government should be asked to set up, on the termination of the Condominium, a special Lands Commission consisting of a neutral President, one British Judge and one French Judge, in order to determine out-standing British claims to land in the Group, including any claims to mines,, minerals or anything below the surface of the soil, and also any caveats lodged by British subjects or British protected persons against non-British claims. (In this connection, and throughout our report we use the expression &quot; British protected persons &quot; as excluding foreigners in the Group, who have opted for the British legal system during the Condominium). We realise that the French would be likely to stipulate that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should pay half the cost of the Commission. We consider that this stipulation, if made, could not reasonably be resisted, but that the local Govern-ment should be expected to pay the cost of the necessary surveys, of the staff required by the Commission, and of its incidental expenses, e.g., travelling. On this basis the half share of the cost as regards salaries might be expected to be roughly  1,600 per annum (inclusive of a Native Advocate). The French Govern-[6669] d
ment should further be asked to agree to a time limit, as short as possible, for the ^completion of the work of the Commission, and they should be asked to guarantee the survey organisation requisite for this purpose. An undertaking should be obtained, if possible, that survey and other fees charged to British litigants, should not be increased above the present Joint Court scale, and, in any case, that fees already paid by British litigants in connection with cases transferred from the Joint Court, should be credited to them.33. It should, we consider, be proposed to the French Government that the work of the special Commission should be subject to the provisions of Articles 22 to 27 of the Protocol of 1914, which now govern the land work of the Joint Court, so far as these provisions are applicable to the claims which would come before the Commission. Should the French propose any modifications in these provisions, their proposals would have to be considered at the time, but the instructions to the negotiators on the British side should, we think, make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom attach importance to (a) a provision that a title issued in accordance with a decision of the Commission shall be definitive and unimpeachable (see Article 26 (5) of the Protocol) and (b) the preservation, at least for a term (say forty years), of the right of British -claimants to apply for title at any time, subject, of course, to the limitation imposed by Article 27 (1) of the Protocol.34. Of these two points, (a) should be regarded as essential, and, in con-nection with it, there should be an understanding that, on the determination .of -a British claim, a definitive and unimpeachable title would be issued by the appropriate French authority without unreasonable delay.35. In connection with (6), we have in mind an arrangement whereby British parties interested would be allowed a period (say six to twelve months from the date of the announcement of the British withdrawal), within which they could elect to lodge their claims for hearing by the special Commission, and that those who did not so elect should not be debarred from prosecuting their claims before the ordinary lands tribunal of the Territory. British claimants would then have a choice of three courses of action : (1) Immediate application to the special Commission;(2) Immediate application to whatever other tribunal may be set up locallyto deal with land claims; or (3) Deferment of application to such other tribunal (within the guaranteedperiod of forty years).36. We are of opinion (see paragraph 18 above) that an attempt should be made to secure that the special Commission should have the assistance of an advocate specially charged with the protection of any native interests in the claims referred to it. It may. at first sight, appear inconsistent to ask for a Commission to deal with British claims, and also for an advocate to search for any native interest in the claims. But we would explain that we are proposing that the Commission should be empowered to recommend definitive and unimpeachable titles, which would oblige it to investigate carefully all oppositions and to satisfy itself that due steps had been taken to bring each claim to the notice -of the natives in the area concerned, and to present any oppositions on their behalf. This would be a continuance of the present procedure, whereby the Native Advocate is charged with the preliminary investigation from the native point of view of each land case before the Joint Court, and with putting forward any claims the natives may have in connection with the case.V. Other Matters to be Agreed with the French.37. There are several minor and administrative matters upon which agree-ment with the French Government will be necessary in connection with the termination of the Condominium; these are dealt with in the following rmragraphs.(i) Non-land Cases before the Joint Court and Courts of First Instance.38. It may be assumed that, at the moment when the Condominium is terminated, there will be cases (other than land cases) pending in the Joint Court and in the Courts of First Instance, from which an appeal lies to the Joint Court.
Such cases are not numerous, but the right of appeal to the Joint Court from a decision of a Court of First Instance should be preserved. We therefore recommend that it should be proposed that cases affecting a British party which, on the day before the date of termination of the Condominium, are to be heard in the Joint Court, whether by way of appeal from a Court of First Instance or otherwise, or in a Court of First Instance, including cases in which summonses had been issued, should be heard by those Courts; appeals, if any, against decisions of Courts of First Instance in such cases being heard in the ordinary way by the Joint Court. The Courts would have to be continued in being for this purpose for a sufficient period, which it is estimated would not exceed three months.39. Appropriate provision should be made for the execution of the judgments of the Joint Court, and for the exercise of the provision (in Article 19 of the Protocol) for the review of sentences imposed by the Joint Court. Whether the power of review should be exercised on the British side by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, who is stationed in Fiji, or by a British Consul in the New Hebrides, might be decided when a decision has been reached as to the appointment of such a Consul.   (See paragraph 55 below.)(ii) Outstanding Cases before the British National Court.40. Although there may be slightly greater objection to proposing the continuance of a purely British Court after sole control is assumed by the French, we recommend that similar arrangements to those proposed in the case of the Joint Court should be asked for. It is unlikely that there will be many cases outstanding in the British Court.(iii) Disposal of Government Property.41. A list of British Government properties in the Group, including those which have been used by the British Administration as residences or offices, is given in Appendix B to this report. We recommend that the French Govern-ment should be asked to take over all these properties at a valuation to be made locally, excepting the Manse referred to, and such, if any, as would be needed for a Consulate, if it is decided to appoint a Consul. In the case of the British Residency, which is held on a lease from Presbyterian Mission  providing that the land is to be used for the quarters of the British Resident, its disposal would be-subject to negotiation with the Mission.42. In addition, if it should not be possible to obtain financial compensation on the lines suggested in paragraphs 13 and 14 above we consider that the French Government might fairly be asked to give compensation (on the basis of one-half the present value) for Condominium Government properties acquired out of funds provided by the two Governments jointly.(iv) Notice to be given in advance of termination of the Condominium43. The Agreement should, of course, specify the date of the termination of the Condominium, and it would be desirable, in the interests, not only of administrative convenience, but of the residents in the Group, some of whom may not desire to continue under a purely French regime, that adequate public notice of the termination should be given. The period to be fixed between the date of the local publication of the terms or substance of the Agreement and the date of the actual termination of the Condominium would depend on circumstances, but we think.that as long a period as 12 months might be necessary.VI. Compensation for Officials.44. We were instructed to examine the question of compensation for officials (British, neutral and native) whose employment will come to an end upon the British withdrawal.   These fall into the following groups : (1) Officers (British and native) in the service of the British Administration (who are paid from United Kingdom funds), including (a) Established pensionable  Civil  Servants  (at present seven  in number, all British);(b) Non-pensionable officers engaged under contracts for a definiteterm (at present forty-six, all native);[6669] d 2
(c) Non-pensionable officers not engaged under contracts for a definite term (at present two British and three native). (2) British officers in the service of the Condominium Administration (who are paid from Condominium funds). There are eleven such officers at present, but one is under notice of termination of engagement expiring on the 15th October, 1931, and a new British Judge is about to be appointed. One of these was engaged under contract for a definite term.(3) Neutral and native officers in the Condominium service.   (There are at present two neutral officers).45. Officials in the service of either the British Administration or the Condominium Administration who were engaged under contracts for a definite term would, of course, have to be dealt with in accordance with the terms of their contracts.46. The officers in the service of the British Administration who are established pensionable Civil Servants would, we understand1, be granted compensation terms on the basis laid down in Section 6 of the Superannuation Act, 1909,* if they cannot be transferred to other employment. For those who are not pensionable, and are not under definite time contracts, a maximum of three months&apos; special leave with pay in the country to which they are repatriated, on termination of appointment, would be allowable in principle; but each case would be dealt with on merits according to the terms of the employment, regard being had to the amount of paid vacation leave due, and any such special paid leave would be regarded as covering any gratuity awardable under the Superannuation Acts if less in amount than the special paid leave. If such gratuity would be greater than three months&apos; leave with pay, the former would he given and not the latter.47. British officials in the Condominium Service who are not under definite time contracts should, we consider, be granted on termination of appointment .special leave with full or half pay in the country of repatriation up to a maximum of three months, each case being dealt with on merits within the maximum, regard being had to the terms of appointment and to the amount of paid furlough due. As an exception, the Collector of Customs, who has had 18 years&apos; service, should, we consider, be granted at least one week&apos;s special leave with pay for each year of service.48. The few neutral and native officers employed in the Condominium Service would have to be dealt with according to individual circumstances, but we consider that airy special retiring benefits should not be more favourable than those accorded to British personnel in the Condominium Service. The French Administration should be asked to take over the natives, which would avoid the necessity of paying any special compensation to them.49. In addition, we consider that each British officer in the British or Condominium Service who is not transferred to other employment should be offered, as an alternative to any passage privilege for which lie may be otherwise eligible, a free passage from the Group to the country in which he was recruited, for himself and his family, subject, however, to the limitation as regards numbers laid down in the leave regulations.50. We think that an attempt should be made to induce the French Government to bear the cost of such retiring benefits and passage privileges as may be granted to officers in the Condominium Service.YII.-Other Matters.51. Other questions which require consideration are dealt with in the following paragraphs:  &apos;(i) Question of Confirmation by Parliament of the proposed Agreement with the French.52. On this matter the Colonial Office and Foreign Office legal advisers have been consulted and their views are set forth in the succeeding paragraph.* See Appendix (!.
53. It was held by the Law Officers in 1925, in connection with the Straits Settlements and Johore Territorial Waters Agreement, that it is constitutionally within the prerogative of the Crown to cede British territory not forming part of a self-governing Dominion, but that it would be undesirable that such a prerogative right should be exercised without the concurrence of Parliament. In the present case there is no question of cession of any British territory- It is solely a question of the withdrawal of His jVIajestys jurisdiction in the New Hebrides in favour of a foreign Power; and as Parliament, since the passing of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. does not legislate in respect of His Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction in foreign countries an Act of Parliament would not seem to be the appropriate method for giving effect to the Agreement with France. Under the present system, any Treaty which requires ratification is laid before the House of Commons for 21 days before His Majesty is advised to effect its ratification. The object of this procedure is to give the House the opportunity of discussing any such Treaty before the country is definitely committed to it by ratification. On the assumption, therefore, that the proposed Agreement will contain the usual ratification clause, Parliament would, under the existing system, have an opportunity of considering it and giving any assent which may be thought desirable.e It would be possible to consider, when the time comes, whether it would be desirable to obtain definite Parliamentary sanction in the form of a resolution approving the ratification of the Agreement, or whether if no desire for a debate is expressed in the House, it would be sufficient to proceed to ratification at the end of the period during which the Agreement has lain before the House.(ii) Repeal of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922.54. It will ultimately be necessary to repeal the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, and any other Orders in Council affecting the Group; and the question of repealing local Regulations issued under their authority will require consideration. It will also be advisable to consider, nearer the date of termination of the Condominium, whether any special provisions will be necessary in connection with prisoners who are British subjects or British-protected persons serving sentences within the Group or outside it. For instance, we are informed that, during the year 1930, a native of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate residing in the New Hebrides was convicted on a charge of murder and ultimately sentenced to a term of five years&apos; penal servitude. The Warrant in this case specified that the man shall be &quot;imprisoned in the prison at Vila in the New Hebrides or in such other prison as the British Resident Commissioner for the time being may from time to time direct,&quot; and also that the sentence shall be brought up for review at the end of three years.(iii) Appointment of Consul.55. This matter appears to be one for consideration by the Foreign Office and Dominions office, after consulting the Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand, who are largely interested. As already indicated, the settlement of various matters of detail is dependent on the question whether a Consul will be appointed. We consider that, in any case, it will be desirable that some British authority should be retained in the New Hebrides for some period after the termination of the Condominium.&apos;(iv) Currency.56. At present both English and French money are legal tender in the Group (Article 4 (4) of the Protocol of the 6th August, 1914). The English money is understood to consist mainly of silver coins. In connection with recent -exchange difficulties, it has been agreed with the French Government that the words &quot;English money&quot; used in the Protocol do not include Australian money, :and that English silver coin is legal tender only up to the limit of  2, as in the United Kingdom. It may be expected that a certain amount of English silver -coin will be in the hands of residents and natives, and we think it desirable that -these persons should be safeguarded as far as possible from loss resulting from English coin ceasing to be legal tender in the Group.
57. If, as we think likely, the French are unwilling to agree to English-silver coin retaining its position as limited legal tender, we suggest that they should be asked to arrange for its redemption out of the profits they would derive-from the further issue of French notes or token coinage which would replace it. If the French should not agree to this, we recommend that steps should be taken, after the approaching termination of the Condominium has been published, to advertise that English money will cease to be legal tender on the termination, but will, up to a specified date, be accepted by the British authorities at its face value in exchange for French money at the current rate of exchange. There appears at present to be a surplus of silver coin generally in the British dependencies in the Pacific, as well as in Australia and New Zealand, and steps will have to be taken to prevent the importation of English coin into the Group from elsewhere in order to take advantage of this arrangement.(Signed) WALTER D.

The population of the various islands is not accurately known, but is approximately as follows : Bora Bora ... ... ... ... 700Raiatea ... ... ... ... 2,200Huahine. ... ... ... ... 1,500Tubuai Manu ... ... ... ... 200Maupiti .... ... ... ... 550With the exception of about 50 Europeans and about 100 Chinese, the entire population is Polynesian.2.

Tons. 5 70 10 1Bora Bora ...Raiatea      ... ... ... ...Huahine Tubuai Manu3. The revenue from the Group is so small as to be almost negligible, and it cannot be increased to any appreciable extent. No mineral deposits have been found.4. The French Government maintains an administration on the islands. Up-to-date details are not available, but it has been ascertained that in 1909 (since when the general form of the administration has not been changed) the European officers in the group included an administrator medical officer (at
Raiatea), two &quot;delegues de 1&quot;administration &quot; (at Huahine and Bora Bora), one police officer (at Raiatea) and seven teachers. In addition, there were a number of native chiefs under the control of the administration, and some native subordinate officials.Appendix B.British Government Property.1. British Residency on the Island of Iririki. The original cost of purchase, erection and equipment was in the vicinity of  3,500. Erected 1906( ?). The ground on which the Resideucy stands was leased from the Presbyterian Mission (who now hold title). The lease is for 999 years, but the Agreement provides that the land is to be used for the quarters of the British Resident and some doubt exists what would be the attitude of the Mission if it were proposed to transfer the lease to the French.2. British Residency Offices. These are situated on the mainland. The original cost of purchase and erection was about  2,300 (1910?). Built on British Government land to which title has been obtained.3. Three Government Houses (occupied by the holders of the posts of Assistant Commissioner; District Agent; Accountant). These houses were built in 1911 and 1912. The cost of purchase, erection and equipment was about  1,100- 1,200 in each case.4. Government House occupied by Assistant to the Commandant of Police.  Purchased in 1927 for  250.5. Government Cottage &quot; Mispah.&quot; Purchased during or just after the war for approximately  200.6. British Residency Office, Paddock and adjoining Lands. Definite title to this land has been given by the Court. All the buildings at 2, 3, 4 and 5 have been erected on it.On a corner of this land stands the house of the Local Presbyterian Minister and the British Resident Commissioner has suggested that on any disposal of the land the Manse be excluded from the transaction.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is also interested in claims to the following :  (a) Petersen Estate. The claim to this land, which is quite near thatmentioned at 6, is at present the subject of dispute.(b) Botany Estate, Deception Island. The Admiralty have lodged a claimto this, but the case has not yet been heard, so far as we are aware. It is understood that the land is of no present use to the Admiralty and has very little value.Appendix C.Section 6 of the Superannuation Act, 1909, is as follows : -Compensation on A bolition of Office.&quot; 6. (1) It shall be lawful for the Treasury to grant to any person retiring or removed from the public service in consequence of the abolition of his office, or for the purpose of facilitating improvements in the organisation of the department to which he belonged, by which greater efficiency and economy can be effected, such special allowance or allowances by way of compensation as on a. full consideration of the circumstances of the case seem to the Treasury to be a reasonable and&apos; just compensation for the loss of office, but not exceeding in any case the amount which a civil servant would be entitled to, or which might be granted to a civil servant, if he retired on the ground of ill-health.
(2) The foregoing provision shall apply only to persons entering the service after the date of the passing of this Act, and shall apply to those persons in substitution for section seven of the Superannuation Act, 1859.Nothing herein contained shall affect the application of the said section seven of the Superannuation Act, 1859, to persons who have entered the service before that date or the practice of the Treasury thereunder.&quot;The amounts which might be granted in the event of retirement on the ground of ill-health, in the case of the officers concerned, all of whom were certificated after 1909, would be determined as follows : An officer with a minimum of 10 years&apos; reckonable service, exclusive of climate addition, would get an annual allowance of one-eightieth of final salary (which may be actual, or average over 2 years) for each year of reckonable service, together with an additional allowance of one-thirtieth of that salary for each such year.An officer with less than 10 years&apos; reckonable service would get a gratuity of one-twelfth of such salary for each year of such service, together with an additional allowance of one-thirtieth of salary for each such year.A minimum of two years&apos; service is necessary to qualify for additional allowance. For purposes of gratuity, each half-year reckons as a unit; thus 6^ years&apos; service produces a gratuity of M of salary, together with an additional allowance of -3%.Reckonable service in the New Hebrides counts as time and a half for purposes of computation, but not for purposes of qualification.o
