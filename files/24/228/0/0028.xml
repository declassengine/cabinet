February 1932.Copy No.9CABINET.THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.THE Cabinet will wish to have from me some account of the progress of the Disarmament Conference, with an indication of the main matters which are coming to the front in the discussions at Geneva and an estimate of future prospects of practical results. I have therefore prepared the following memorandum : 1. The general discussion was opened on the 8th February by my speech on behalf of the British Delegation : (it is now available as a Parliamentary paper Cmd. 4018 of 1932). M. Tardieu followed on the same day for France. On the 9th February there were speeches for the United States, Germany and Brazil. On the 10th February for Italy, Japan and Poland. On the&quot; 11th February for Belgium, Soviet Russia, and Sweden. On the 12th February for Spain, Denmark and Czechoslovakia. On the 13th February for Canada (an excellent discourse from Sir George Perley, urging that Canadian experience illustrated how disarmament might lead to good relations), Latvia, Hungary and China. On the 15th February for Turkey, Norway, Portugal and the Netherlands. On the 17th February for Finland, Roumania, Austria, Estonia and Uruguay, and so forth.2. On Friday, the 5th February, before the general debate began, France sprang a surprise by tabling a memorandum Avhich put forward, with a great air of precision and boldness, a series of striking proposals. At first blush, the French memorandum seems to be primarily concerned with a plan for providing the League of Nations with forces which could be used for assisting the victim and punishing the aggressor. But, as I will point out later in this paper, all this is really a screen to cover the essential central feature of the French plan upon which everything else hangs, viz., the provision of further security. In opening the debate it was impossible to avoid all reference to the French plan, of which everyone was talking, so it was agreed as a result of consultation between the members of the British Delegation that I should employ the following language about it : &quot;The members of the Conference have noted with much interest (though I do not think they can yet have found time closely to study) the elaborate proposals made public a day or two ago by the French Delegation in connection with this class of subject. Manifestly, these matters will be a topic for grave and detailed consideration by some organ of the Conference hereafter. I will only say at the moment, on behalf of the British Government, that these proposals, as,, indeed, all other carefully formulated suggestions, will be studied with the closest and most sympathetic attention, and that we shall not he found to be lagging in any changes which are found after adequate examination to be beneficial and practicable and which will really contribute to armament reduction.&quot;The implied criticism that the French memorandum did not &quot; really contribute to armament reduction &quot; was widely noted and is, I venture to think, one of the fundamental criticisms of the whole French scheme.3. It is convenient here to indicate, very briefly, the most important concrete proposals made by other speakers.I.6248[6612]B
America and Italy are the two great Powers which have made a list of proposals which to a large extent agree with our own. Signor Grandi&apos;s speech was particularly impressive. The French contribution was a characteristic exhibition of gallic phrasing but the edge was rather taken off it by the previous publication of the French memorandum and the criticism it had received. It was noticeable that M. Tardieu almost completely avoided the use of the word &quot;security,&quot;&apos; but reached the same result by insisting upon &quot; the organisation of peace.&quot; There is undeniable force in the contention put forward by France and others that Article 8 of the Covenant does not merely call for &apos;&apos; the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety,&quot; but also lays down the condition that the armament level must be the lowest consistent with &quot;the enforcement by common consent of national obligations.&quot;Dr. Bruning put the case for Germany with much discretion and moderation. Underlying his whole speech was the claim that differences of status in the matter of armaments ought to come to an end, and that Germany asked for the recog-nition of the principle of equality of treatment. Germany has now elaborated her point of view in more definite terms.M. Litvinov was the only prominent speaker to put the French memorandum under remorseless examination. The Soviet Representative pleasantly observed that he understood that the League of Nations was to be provided with a bombing force in order to punish the aggressor, but that experience showed it was often difficult to determine who the aggressor was; he could hardly suppose, however, that the League intended to bomb both sides simultaneously in order to be sure in any case that the aggressor was hit!Signor Grandi specifically approved of the British proposition that we must pursue disarmament by the double method of fixing quantitative maxima, and of qualitative limitation of the kinds of weapons we outlaw.The abolition of submarines was advocated by Britain, Italy and America; it was disappointing that America did not clearly advocate the reduction in the maximum tonnage of capital ships. Most of the principal speakers expressed the view that the Draft Disarmament Convention was the framework upon which more detailed discussion should proceed. Bombing from the air was mentioned with disfavour by several principal speakers, Italy going in for &quot; abolition of bombing aircraft&quot; and &quot;abolition of aircraft carriers.&quot; In view of Cabinet instructions, the British declaration on this point could not be in such absolute terms, but the Cabinet will see (in paragraph 12 of my speech) that we indicated our strong desire to have the newer methods of warfare the use of gas, of the submarine and of bombing from the air specially examined. Britain argued the case for the abolition of the submarine and of gas warfare in more detail.4. The general effect of these introductory speeches is to show that there is a considerable body of opinion which declares itself in favour of both quantitative and qualitative reduction. But the satisfaction to be derived from these declarations is less complete because (a) the declarations, so far, are in very general terms, and the whole of thepractical and technical difficulties remain to be considered; and(b) all the principal Powers do not select the same objects for attainment.France does not give any encouragement to the idea of abolishing submarines altogether; neither does Japan. Indeed, as regards France, it remains to be seen whether the scheme of her Memorandum does not cut right across the scheme of the Draft Disarmament Convention. The general impression, however, at. Geneva undoubtedly is that the early debate has indicated more general agree-ment than might have been expected. A cynic observed to me that there had never been a Conference from which so much was hoped and so little expected, and confessed that he was now rather more optimistic.5. The plan of operations after the general debate is over is as follows : The &quot;Bureau&quot; is to meet to allocate topics to different committees. Some of these will be engaged on technical questions of great complexity. There is also the main Committee, or &quot;Commission Generate,&quot; over which Mr. Henderson presides and M. Politis is Vice-Chairman. It is presumably to this general committee that the political and non-technical aspects of various questions will be sent, e.g., the French thesis of &quot;security&quot; will have to be dealt with there.
The Cabinet is aware that up. to the present the British Delegation is very ill-provided with instructions or material to deal with this aspect of the matter. I think it is certain that a little later on, if not now, some further instructions will have to be given to my colleagues and myself as to the way in which this class of question is to be handled. This is the more urgent because the French Memorandum is likely to get strong support from Poland and the Little Entente and vague approval from a large number of small States. At the beginning, it was possible to avoid pronouncing a blunt negative by selected generalisations, as in paragraph 8 of my speech, but in the Committee we shall have to be more precise, and up to the present we have no precise sailing orders.ii.The French Memorandum.6. My colleagues may be glad to have before them a few observations, from the non-technical point of view, by way of examination and criticism of the French Memorandum.  The French scheme may be shortly described as follows : (i) It proceeds on the assumption (which would not, I think, be acceptedby our own Air authorities) that &apos;&apos; bombing machines &apos;&apos; constitute a self-contained class of air vessel, and, indeed, are the only kind of military aircraft that can be used offensively against a civilian popula-tion. The memorandum then proceeds to deal with &apos;&apos; bombing &apos;&apos; machines &quot; of three classes, differentiated by having regard to their unladen tonnage.(ii) Bombing machines of the heaviest class are to be transferred to theLeague of Nations. Moreover, in order to limit the risk of civil air-liners being used by a State for bombing purposes, civilian machines above a certain weight are to be held only by &apos;&apos; continental, inter-con -continental or inter-colonial organisations &quot; operating under the auspices of the League of Nations. It will be noted that the League of Nations does not own and has not the physical control of these air-liners, but is to have the right to requisition them in an emergency.(iii) Bombing machines with a weight belowr the limit at which they aretransferred to the League of Nations and otherwise prohibited, are divided into two classes. The &quot; middle-weights &quot; remain in the hands of the State that owns them, but the State is to undertake to place them at the disposal of the League in the event of the application of Article 16 of the Covenant. The &quot; bantam &quot; class of bombers remains at the disposal of the owning State in all eventualities.(iv) The French memorandum throws out, rather vaguely, the suggestionthat a similar treatment might be applied to certain land and naval forces, so that long-range artillery, capital ships and larger submarines would only be lawfully held by a State if they are at the disposal of the League of Nations for the purpose of common action against an aggressor.(v) In all the above cases there is a &quot; let out &quot; clause providing that a Stateneed not put these weapons at the disposal of the League of Nations if it needs them for the purpose of warding off an aggressor. It is manifest, therefore, that excuses for not handing over may be proffered at a very critical moment.(vi) The above provisions, so far as they concern the transfer or earmarkingof certain classes of weapon for the League of Nations, are designed to create, actually or potentially, an International Force with the double function of assisting the victim and punishing the aggressor. Presumably, the identification of aggressor and victim is to be left to the Council of the League. The memorandum is silent as to whether unanimity in the Council is needed to identify the aggressor or to give instructions to the international Commander-in-Chief, or whether these decisions can be taken by a majority vote.(vii) Finally, but fundamentally, comes part V of the French memorandum.which insists that the whole of the above scheme depends upon[6612] b 2
&quot;* political measures, which alone permit and guarantee their successful operation.&apos;&apos; The document declares that there must be a change of method, and that in future &quot; we must seek in common action that security which each nation has hitherto endeavoured to obtain from its own forces alone.&quot; The document asserts that a definite choice must be made &quot; between a League of Nations possessing executive authority and a League of Nations paralysed by the uncompromising-attitude of national sovereignty. France has made her choice, she suggests that the other nations should make theirs.&quot; The French proposals, it is added, are unthinkable without compulsory arbitration, definition of the aggressor, guarantees as to the rapidity of the decision of the authority controlling the international force, the bringing of the action of that authority into conformity with international law, and international control of the execution of all agreements concerning armaments.7. Without at all wishing to suggest a premature judgment on the French proposal, it will be obvious from the last words that France is making the acceptance of the Protocol of 1924 the condition upon which her whole scheme depends. She is preparing for a position in which she can claim that she has made the most elaborate and concrete series of suggestions to arm the League of Nations with effective authority, and if these suggestions are rejected the respon-sibility will rest on other nations who are not willing to agree to the necessary condition. It seems to me, however, that already there is widespread feeling that the French proposals would not necessarily bring about any reduction in arma-ments. There is nothing in the French memorandum about reduction. The bombing weapon is to be retained, at any rate to a large extent, in the hands of an individual State subject to a promise to put a portion of it, if requested, at the service of the League, but with a further condition which might excuse the non-performance of the promise.8. The other main consideration which suggests itself about the technical side of the French plan appear to me to be the following: An international force implies an international General Staff. Though the General Staff is inter-national, the individuals who compose it are not. One of them may be a French General, another may be a British Admiral, and so on. Part of the duty of the international General Staff would be to work out in advance, presumably at Geneva, how the international force would be used in hypothetical circumstances  say, in the unhappy event of country A seeking to bomb the capital of country B by way of aggression. The disposition of the international forces, the strategic and tactical arrangements, even their preliminary training and position, would all have to be decided in advance by the international General Staff, and put away in the international pigeon-hole. Now, supjiose that the hypothetical event occurs. It is difficult to think that the distinguished service authorities of different nations who are responsible for these plans would be willing to carry them out against the nation to which they belonged. It is the essence of the plans of any General Staff that they should not be disclosed to the potential enemy in advance and it appears to me that a very trying confusion of loyalties would arise in the breasts of members of the international Staff. There are, of course, two further difficulties which occur to anyone and which may be put thus: (a) International operations, though planned in advance by an international General Staff, must be authorised by an international Cabinet. The inter-national Cabinet is the Council of the League. It will be difficult to secure that the Council of the League would promptly put in force violent measures against its most powerful individual members, though no doubt it might cheerfully authorise the international fleet in the air or at sea to punish the aggression of smaller States. Moreover, the international forces may be abundantly large to crush a small State, but not adequate to deal with a big one.(b) One may perhaps test the merits of the French plan as a practical scheme by asking oneself this question : If it had been in force during- the last four months what would Geneva have done about Shanghai ?There is of course the further difficulty (as the French memorandum recog-recognises) that a powerful State which had its capital bombed by pilots of half &quot;a
dozen nationalities under orders of Geneva might take it into its head to treat the pilots not as international persons serving a super-State but as nationals of. the countries to which they belonged.III.The British Suggestions.(A) Naval.9. As above indicated, there is really no prospect of getting universal agree-ment for the abolition of submarines : France and Japan will not agree. On the other hand, a number of important States agree with the British view. As many of the smaller States tend to regard the submarine as a comparatively cheap means of defence, it seems probable that there will be a large vote for retaining them. It is understood that some of the Dominions would find it easier to embrace the British view wholeheartedly if our contention was put on humanitarian grounds, so as to avoid the controversy as to whether submarines are a method of defence.Apart from submarines, the case presented by Britain is that the achieve-ments of the Washington and London Naval Treaties must be preserved at all costs, and, if not incorporated in, at any rate annexed to, any international Con-vention which results from the present conference. Mr. Gibson, for the United States of America, has stated that they &quot; advocate proportional reductions from the figures laid down in the London and Washington Naval Treaty on naval tonnage as soon as all parties to the Washington agreement have entered its framework,&quot; i.e., as soon as France and Italy have subscribed to the London Treaty. Private discussions have been going on at Geneva, in which I have taken part, to see if France would not accept a compromise fixing her annual naval construction down to the end of 1935 at a figure which we have reason to believe Italy would accept. At present France raises objection to this, and urges that the only acceptable agreement would be one between Britain and France fixing final ratios of strength. I have urged on M. Tardieu privately the great importance of reaching agreement on the more limited point as soon as possible, both on the ground that it would relieve the tension between France and Italy, and because it would set an example to the conference as a whole as showing that by mutual accommodation practical results can be achieved. Up to the present, however, there is no sign that the French will be persuaded.From the point of view of obtaining the support of the Smaller Powers, it appears important that we should continue to associate our proposals for the abolition of the submarine with proposals for the reduction of the size of larger naval vessels and of the maximum calibre of the naval gun. In referring to this subject in my speech I was intentionally guarded because I understand that America would not agree to support such proposals unless she were permitted to initiate them herself.Our two primary objectives on the naval, side should, therefore, be (a) to induce France and Italy to subscribe to Part III of the London Naval Treaty; (b) then to persuade America to put forward definite proposals for the reduction of the size of the capital ship and the calibre of its main armament.(B) Military.10. As I indicated in my speech, I think that we should reserve our decision whether we should, definitely support the abolition of conscription until we see how the discussions develop in the Military Committee. This is a delicate and highly controversial subject, the discussion of which is likely to inflame continental feelings without leading to any practical results. It will be remembered that the Cabinet have given the British Delegation a free hand in this matter. In any case, our policy should be to support any practical proposals for limiting the number of effectives.In the field of land armaments, the major proposals before the Conference are directed towards (a) a reduction in the calibre of big guns, and (b) the abolition, or restriction in size, of tanks. There are certain technical difficulties in the way of ensuring the effective restriction of the size of big guns, but I think
that we should support the principle if it is found to be practicable. The question of the abolition of the tank is much more difficult. Its abolition can hardly be put forward on humanitarian grounds; it is essentially a weapon for use on the battlefield and was evolved as a means of saving the life of combatants. On the other hand, on the analogy of the battleship, we could support any practical proposals both for limiting the size of the machine and its armament.. I feel strongly that it will be difficult to assert that tanks are weapons of defence. Of course it is safer to be inside a tank than inside a motor car, but the French for a tank is char d&apos;assaut, and a &quot; car of assault&quot; can hardly claim to be a purely defensive construction.(C) Air.11. The French proposals for dealing with bombing aircraft, including the internationalisation of civil aviation, have been discussed above. A proposal has been put before the conference by Signor Grandi for the total abolition of bombing aircraft, which seems to be open to some of the same objections as those connected with the French proposals. It is, indeed, very easy to pick holes in any plan for putting an end to bombing from the air. But the idea underlying this class of proposal undoubtedly has a strong measure of popular approval because the object is to safeguard the civil population from being exposed to some of the horrors of bombing warfare; indeed, the idea has been mentioned with favour by practically all speakers at the conference.The Chief of the Air Staff has formulated some of the practical and technical difficulties as follows : Bombing machines, it is argued, are not a class by them-selves in point of construction; any machine with sufficient lift and power can carry bombs. The conversion, for example, of a photographic machine or a reconnaissance machine into a bomber is a simple operation. Bombs, therefore, it is argued, will be dropped from the skies in any case, and the only difference will be that, without training and bomb-sights, the machines will be more likely to hit the wrong object when aiming at military objects. The use of bombing machines as a cheap and effective way of maintaining order in distant parts of the world, such as the North-West Frontier and Iraq, would be difficult for us to give up. The method is effective, but not brutal, for it produces more alarm and noise than actual suffering or destruction. In any case, it would be impossible to prohibit bombing in Europe while maintaining that it was a very appropriate method in Asia or Africa. Finally, it is contended that an international convention which purports to prohibit all modern air warfare means there will be no rules and regulations laying down conditions for bombing, e.g., giving notice to warn civilians, or perhaps limiting the size of bombs.I clo not say that I agree with the above arguments, but they indicate the point of view which many technical experts will advance. On the other hand, the Citbinet would be slow to instruct the British delegation to oppose a blank negative to proposals to outlaw bombing. Signor Grandi indicated that the only part of the French proposals which he was prepared to accept was the suggestion that any flagrant violation of the suggested rules for the protection of the civilian population &quot; will be regarded as primd facie evidence that the State guilty thereof has resorted to war within the meaning of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.&quot; It has been suggested that bomb dropping on the territory of another sovereign Power should be a conclusive proof of aggression.Putting the above considerations together, I submit that our policy should be to advocate the practical examination of the whole problem of bombing from the air in its widest possible form, and that, in the meantime, it would be well to get the technical aspects of the question examined by the inter-departmental committee set up in accordance with Cabinet decision 8 (32), conclusion 2.J SFebruary 20, 1932.o

Speech by the Right Honourable Sir John Simon, M.P., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, at the Opening of the Disarmament Conference.February 8, 1982.Whkn the suggestion was made that in the opening debate which begins to-day, Great Britain should speak the first word, it was hoped and intended that that word should be spoken by Mr. Bamsay MacDonald. I am sure that I am expressing the sentiments of you all. as well as my own strong feeling, when I say how deeply we regret the enforced absence of the British Prime Minister, and the cause of it. The latest message from London gives the cheering news that he is making a good recovery and he is resolved, when he is better, to take part in our deliberations in due course.2. In these preliminary discussions, to which I have the honour and responsibility of making a first contribution, we must take a general view of the r)roblems before us, but we must avoid wasting time and exhausting the opportunity in mere generalities. More than ten years of intensive study have been consumed in the work of preparation for this Disarmament Conference and, as the President rightly asserted in his opening speech, this period of preparatory work was absolutely necessary. Mr. Henderson, you will remember, quoted the observation of M. Briand last year that if the attempt had been made to call together the conference ten years ago, the lack of adeqitate preparation would certainly have brought disaster in its train. This is a case in which the English proverb &quot; More haste, less speed &quot; applies, and now the time has come for us to bend our energies in a united effort to make a fruitful use of the results of so much preparation.3. It may well be admitted that those who signed the Covenant on the 28th June, 1919, and the States who ratified it early in the follow-ing year, hardly contemplated that it would not be until February 1932 that the first Disarmament Conference would actually meet. After the armistice, nations that were still bleeding from the scourge of font years of war were united in desiring to reduce without delay the risk of renewed conflict by the reduction of national armaments by the method of international agreement. That intention is both explicit and implicit in the Treaty of Versailles. It was the general resolve, in all quarters and in all good faith, to strike while the iron was hot and to apply the painful lessons of the war while those lessons were fresh in our minds.Yet the difficulties have proved so great and the work of preparation has of necessity lasted so long, that it is only now that it has been found possible to enter upon what I profoundly trust may prove the effective stage of our task.4. Even now, voices are heard which declare that the moment is not opportune. The paradox is pointed out that, while disarmament is being discussed at Geneva, in the Far East armaments are being
s231employed, bombs are dropping from the skies, troops are on the move and the ideals of the Covenant are in jeopardy. I do not agree, with [hose who suggest that this paradox makes our. meeting inopportune. I would rather declare that these sombre events illustrate and reinforce the urgent necessity of undertaking and discharging our task.5. There are two other reflections connected with the interval of thirteen years that has elapsed since the armistice which I would venture to place before my colleagues assembled here. The generation which had actual experience of the horrors of 1914 to 1918 is beginning to slip away. This reflection was borne in upon the older amongst us who were present on Saturday when we listened with so much admiral-tion and sympathy to eloquent addresses delivered in support of the widely-signed petition of the students of the world. Did not you find yourself suddenly seized with the thought, which gripped one&apos;s heart, that these young men who pleaded so bravely and passionately for peace were themselves mere children at the time when the rest of us were passing through the inferno of war ? There are men and women of full age in every country who are now beginning to exercise authority in public affairs whose personal knowledge of 1914 to 1918 is but a childish memory. The memory of a nation persists ; when that national memory is deep and bitter it does more to foster suspicion and to breed fear than any other influence. But the memory of the individual is so short that personal experience soon loses its sharpness, And, there-fore, ?follow is the accepted time for the promotion of disarmament; the work of effective international disarmament will not be rendered easier, but will, in fact, become more and more difficult as the years go on unless we accomplish something now.(i. The second reflection is this. During this interval of time the different States of the world have proceeded in the matter of armaments along different, and to some extent divergent, lines, and the process of securing agreed international adjustment is rendered more difficult thereby. Some States have been living under limitations imposed by treaties which they signed. Other States have evolved a system of armaments according to their own conception of their needs and obligations or the call of their public opinion without treaty restriction other than that article of the Covenant which recognises that the main-tenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations. The result is that an increasing divergence is manifest. Some States, indeed, can point to a record of decreasing expenditure in recent years. I am not seeking in what I am now saying to institute comparisons with what has been and iE being accomplished in other countries, among whom the same claim may be made, but I take, by way of illustration, the country I know best, which is my own.7. I mention this matter now because the practical application of a system of agreed limitation of armaments undoubtedly involves the
establishment of a fair datum line as between different States. In seeking to fix the proper limit in each ease we cannot expect to arrive at a mathematical correspondence in actual figures, for considerations of size and geography and special needs all introduce factors of varia-tion ; national circumstances vary and armaments may vary with them. But the fact that there has been this long interval before we could meet together to grapple with our common task adds a complication in this connexion which it would be foolish to deny. A State that has been reducing its armaments in recent years will naturally and properly expect this fact to be borne in mind, and that is why, in these pre-liminary remarks, I dwell upon the importance of establishing upon sound principles the conception of a datum line in order that we may effectively enter upon the task of the further reduction of armaments together.8. There is one other observation which I wish to make before 1 indicate some of the directions in which the influence of Great Britain will be more especially thrown in the course of subsequent discussion. Disarmament is a means to an end. Terrible as is the economic burden of armaments and enormous as would be the relief to the taxpayer if the burden was lightened, this is not the primary purpose for which we pursue it. Disarmament is pursued first and foremost as an effective method of buttressing peace and of limiting the risks and suffering of sudden and devastating war. In this respect, an immense change has come over the judgment of the world. The proposition that the peace of the world is to be secured by preparing for war is no longer believed by anybody, for recent history manifestly disproves it. A high level of armaments is no substitute for security. At best, it only creates the illusion of security in one quarter while at the same time aggravating the sense of insecurity in another. The. security which we set before us as our ideal is security for all, and security for all fundamentally depends on armament reduction. Armaments are the symptom of a pathological condition. It is the fear of attack and the distrust of one&apos;s neighbours which are the compelling cause, but the very fact of piling up armaments under this deep-seated impulse only transfers the morbid condition to another quarter. It is at best an attempt to rid oneself of the plague by infecting one&apos;s neighbours, and the present condition of world opinion at this moment is not that armaments are a security for world peace. Distracted mankind may feel that they are inevitable, but as an instrument for world peace we know that they are useless. Our problem, therefore, is nothing less than to deliver the world from despair and to do so not by exhausting ourselves over melancholy reflections, but by a resolute course of practical and applied energy.9. Let us then turn in the light of these general reflections to our practical task. We meet to devise, or at least to begin, an international system for limiting armaments. We are agreed that the object is good; we are agreed that the need is great; we are resolved to face
every difficulty like practical men and to strive to overcome it in a practical spirit. As practical men we must recognise that the limitation of armaments by international agreement can only be brought about by the use of one or both of two methods of treatment. One is the method of fixing maximum limits beyond which we severally bind ourselves not to go; the other is the method of excluding by inter-national agreement, from use in warfare certain defined instruments or methods, and for both these modes of treatment we require as a further safeguard some international authority which will effectively secure that these limitations are not overstepped, by ascertaining and making known cases of transgression with a view to bringing effective world pressure upon the wrongdoer.10. I desire to announce on behalf of the Government of Great Britain that we advocate both these methods of treatment and will do our utmost, in loyal and friendly co-operation with the other States of the world, to help to devise and bring into effect plans to apply them. Both methods are embodied in the draft Disarmament Convention the product of five years of intensive labour by the Preparatory Commission and here I must be allowed to pay my own tribute to the work which that commission has done and, in particular, to express, as I believe the whole conference will wish me to do, our thanks for the devotion and skill thrown into the task by my compatriot Lord Cecil.The President, in his opening statement, pointed out that this conference has been called together on the basis of this indispensable preparatory work. And here it is convenient to say that in the view of the British Government the Draft Convention, subject, of course, to the close examination which each article of it would have to receive in the course of our discussions, does provide the best groundwork upon which to proceed.11. The Preparatory Commission has given much attention to the methods by which the principle of limitation by the fixing of maxima might be applied. This is a matter to which the British Government has given close attention, and at the proper time we shall wish to join in detailed discussions about it. I would, for the moment, confine myself to a single observation. It must be the sincere and constant object of us all, by limiting our estimates to what is strictly necessary for defence and for international obligations and by co-operation -and comparison amongst ourselves, to discourage all extravagant or fantastic claims and to fix the maxima in each case at as low a figure as possible. Only thus shall we demonstrate to the world and to each other our resolve to secure a real reduction. And for the same reason, while the broad objective of securing in respect of the armaments of the world as a whole a large percentage of reduction in the total, such as 25 per cent., is admirable, I may express the view that the maxima fixed for an individual State should be its permitted limit, and that this will tend to reduce the figure better than by first asking it to fix a named limit and then allowing it to arm up to a fraction of that limit.
The percentage reduction applied to an assumed figure in the future will only tend to make that assumed figure bigger than it ought to be. Not only our declared objective, but our methods of attaining it, should all be directed to the purpose, as far as possible, of securing not only a limitation but a reduction in armaments.12, As regards the second principle of treatment, viz., the outlawing by international agreement of certain weapons and methods of warfare, it seems to me that we are most likely to find these weapons and methods among the most recent developments. This is not only because it is the most recent lapses in habit which are the least difficult to eradicate, but because these new methods of warfare  the use of gas, of the submarine, of bombing from the air all have this common feature, that they tend to obliterate the boundary first drawn by Hugo Grotius and maintained by the practice of modern warfare so far as possible as long as a distinction could be effectively drawn between combatants and non-combatants. For of all the horrible features which warfare presents, there is nothing which so fills the imagination with forebodings for the future, nothing which lias more effectively evoked the protests and the appeals which wo hear echoed in the petitions of Saturday, nothing, I would venture to say, which is so repulsive to all who are actually engaged in the profession of arms, as the promiscuous character of the destruction which modern war threatens. This is, indeed, a World Conference on Disarmament, for there is no calling, however peaceful, no home, however distant and humble, no innocence of life, no weakness of sex, no immaturity of age which is not in peril of the consequence if the most modern methods of warfare cannot be curbed or abandoned.18. The members of the conference have noted with much interest (though I do not think they can yet have found time closely to study i the elaborate proposals made public a day or two ago by the French delegation in connexion with this class of subject. Manifestly, these matters will be a topic for grave and detailed consideration by some organ of the conference hereafter. I will only say at the moment, on behalf of the British Government, that these proposals, as, indeed, all other carefully formulated suggestions, will be studied with the closest and most sympathetic attention and that we shall not be found to be lagging in any changes which are found after adequate examination to be beneficial and practicable and which will really contribute to armament reduction. With much less elaboration, but with equal sincerity, I mention two other recently-developed manifestations of warfare wdiich merit our close attention. In 1925 there was signed the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare. In this protocol, the plenipotentiaries of forty-four nations declared that the use of such gases in war &apos;&apos; has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world,&quot; and the parties to this protocol, in accepting the prohibition of such use, agreed similarly to prohibit
bacteriological methods of warfare between themselves. I believe that at least thirty-two Governments have already ratified this protocol and I am glad to think that among them are the Governments of all the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. A similar prohibition is contained in article 39 of the draft convention for disarmament which we have before us. I feel convinced that the conscience of the civilised world will not be satisfied till similar effective prohibitions have been imposed on all practices which shock our common humanity.14. The other weapon to which I wish specifically to refer is the submarine. I am well aware that the view is entertained in some quarters that the submarine might maintain its place among legitimate weapons of defence. In my own country we feel sincerely that such a view is mistaken. There is abundant experience in the late war to show that the effective use of the submarine almost inevitably involves, however involuntarily, a greater degree of inhumanity than is to be found in almost any other type of warfare. The abolition of the sub-marine, I will not disguise the fact, would be in the interest of our country, but in saying this I absolutely deny that we regard its abolition as any exclusive interest of ours. In desiring its abolition we are not aiming at making ourselves relatively stronger against our neighbours. Our proposal is made not in the interests of our fighting strength, but in the interests of humanity and of stable and permanent peace. The prohibition and abolition of submarines would be a contri-bution to disarmament which the citizens of every country would understand. It is no complicated technical question; it involves no grave difficulty of definition : it would be a clear and certain step in the path of disarmament. The skill and the gallantry which are involved in this dangerous service and in Britain to-day we are mourning the loss of a submarine crew of sixty men engulfed in the course of their service in time of peace are no justification for its continuance. The abolition of such an instrument of warfare would be rightly hailed as such an advance in the path of disarmament as would prove our ability to accomplish the purpose of the conference and facilitate discussions of other problems which we have met to solve.Apart from this, it is well known that certain of the naval Powers have already given serious consideration to the question of reduction of naval armaments and have achieved positive and valuable results in the shape of the Washington and London Naval Treaties. It is the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government that these treaties represent a substantial contribution to the cause which we all have at heart and that they should be retained intact until they expire in December 1936. We believe that the conference will find it well to accept the work of the Washington and London agreements, building upon them and framing the general convention upon their continued operation. How this can best be done will be a matter for close consideration as the conference progresses.
15. Let me sum up, then, by indicating in simple and direct terms some of the directions in which the British delegation believe that the limitation and reduction of armaments may be practically applied. Some of these matters have been already touched upon in what I have said; there are others in regard to which we are convinced that practical progress should now be made ; and we are anxious to join our colleagues here in the pursuit of every practicable means. We accept, as the basis of our future discussion, the general scheme of the draft Disarmamenr Convention. We accept, in general, the methods of limitation by reference to the establishment of maxima contained in that convention. We support the establishment of a permanent disarmament commis-sion; we urge the abolition of gas and chemical warfare. We press for the abolition of submarines. The abolition of conscription is, as we realise, a subject with controversial aspects, but we seek and urge upon others the most practicable course for limiting by agreement the numbers of effectives. - The temptation to resort to armed conflict is obviously reduced if defence is strengthened at the expense of attack. And since our common object is not to increase but to diminish the sum total of armaments and their expense, it follows that we must direct especial attention to such prohibitions or limitations as will weaken the attack and so remove temptation for aggression. I have already made a reference to what has been accomplished as between certain of the principal naval Powers in the direction of limitation of naval arma-ments, and we are ready to co-operate in whatever methods are found most practicable for agreed reduction in the size of capftSi-ships and of maximum gun calibre, as well as in any practical application of the principle of prohibiting land guns above a certain calibre.This list is not, nor is it intended to be, exhaustive. It appears to me that at this, the earliest stage of our general discussion, the interests which we are gathered together to serve are best consulted by a certain elasticity of view combined with the proof of a definite deter -mination to pursue our common object by the most practical means available.16. We do not conceal from ourselves the difficulty of attaining success in our task, but before any one of us abandons hopes of success, let him reflect upon the consequences of failure. Many peace con-ferences have failed before this, and the consequences of their failure are written in letters of blood in the history of the world, but failure now means nothing short of an unmeasured and immeasurable calamity. We have to proceed in our task through many weeks and months, conscious of the doom which is in store for mankind if some practical results are not achieved. We represent the mass of the people in all lands, the people who fight the wars, and are hoping even against hope, for a wise issue from our deliberations. Possunt quia posnc videntur: success comes to those who are resolved to succeed.6242 Wt.- 1250 2/32 F.O.P. 6598 Gp. 340 .. -
