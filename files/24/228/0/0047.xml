This decision was taken however without preju-dico to a note in the Report of the Committee, reserving the recommendations on budgetary expenditure until the opinion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been sought.question, and have come to the conclusion that the principle of budgetary limitation is not one which I can accept, for the following reasons..Service Departments respecting the budgetary limits on expenditure during the next 4 years for which they would be obliged to ask..    The Admiralty put their claim at  67 millions, compared with  50-g- million estimated for 1932;    the Army ask for  45,65C,OOP,  as against  36,438,000 for 1932;    and the Air Ministry, without naming any figure, suggest a new British limit of 1953 first line aircraft as against our present strength of 7853 which might be expected to cost more than double the 1932 Air Estimate of  17,400j000o    Thus the total for the three Services might be put at  150 millions,  an increase of nearly 50$ over the 19 32 figure of  104 million.I have given careful consideration to this(1)&quot;,7e now have before us the views of the three
It is not of course suggested that we should spend up to this figure immediately;    and It may oven bo argued that the gap between.our actual expenditure and our legitimate requirements can be usecbas evidence of our loyalty to the cause of disarmament.But I cannot for a moment believe that figures of this kind could be put forward publicly without serious injury to our interests.In the first place the mere publication of such figures will make the idea of Budgetary Limitation seem ridiculous, and may well give rise to grave anxiety, both at home and abroad, as to our future policy.    In justifi-cation of our claims, we should be obliged to give explanations which would imply, particularly in the case of our Air forces, a policy of expansion rather than restriction of armaments.Secondly, however much we may protest that our position is exceptional, our figures will certainly be used by other Pow ers as justification for similar demands on their part.(2)    The difficulties of operating a system of budgetary limitation are of course very greatly intensified by the fact that so many of the countries concerned are off the gold standard.    For the purpose of comparing one country&apos;s expenditure with another,  It is essential to reduce both to a common factor, which must be gold.      But at the current rate of exchange the gold equivalent of our estimated expenditure of  104 millions in 1932 is only about  80 million;    and the discrepancy between
current expenditure end thy propoaod,budget^^-lXraits becomeb still more fantastic.      It may be said that this could be got over by fixing the limit in terms of gold; but if the pound&quot; &quot;were to return to par -within the 4-year period a gold limit of say  114 million (the equivalent of  150 sterling at 3.70) might quite possibly prove inadequate.      Nor should I welcome a discussion at Geneva of the possible future movement of the sterling exchange during the next 4 years.Again it may be said that the object of budgetary limitation is not so much to compare one country with another, as to see how the expenditure of each country varies from year to year,, &quot;with a view to restricting its outlay in the following period more closely according to its actual requirements in the past. But as long as a country is off the gold standard there is always the possibility of such wide variations in the-internal price level as will nalce comparison of expendi-ture from year to year of very little value.For these reasons I am satisfied that we ought not to support the policy of Budgetary Limitation under present circumstances.,      It may be that at some future d.ate it will prove a valuable supplement to other methods of restriction of armaments, but as things are now I feel sure that it would be more of a  anger than a support.(Intld,)   N.0.reasury Chaxabers?
