s0ooument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.GAB  I M E IE.C R E T . Copy No...../. . .ECONOMIES IN FPLICE EXPENDITURE .. 94(32)Memorandum by the Home Secretary.It will he remembered that, in accordance with the recommendation of the May Committee, the savings in police expenditure were to be effected in two instalments.    Under the scheme adopted by the Government,  they were to be found in part by cuts in police pay  (including the lower rates provisionally adopted for new entrants to the Service), and in part by various administrative economies.    The measures for securing the first instalment of savings, mainly by means of the cuts in pay, were put into operation last Octobers    the further measures for securing; the second instalment are due to be put into operation as from October next.    It was understood that any administrative savings that could be secured would be taken into account in determining the second instalment of cut in pay, but it was not expected, nor does it seem at all possible, that the whole of the second instalment of savings can be secured in that way.    The question whether any additional cut from pay will be made, and,  if any, of what amount,  is naturally very much in the minds of all ranks of the police.I attach a memorandum from the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police on this subject.    It will be seen that Lord Trenchard views the situation with misgiving, and indeed with anxiety, and I have reason to think that what he says about London applies to the country generally.At the same time, I would put no proposal before the Cabinet which would go back upon the undertaking given to the Chancellor of the Exchequer when the Economy Bill was under discussion.     The budgetary savings should remain the same.    It was, however, understood that Departments were free to make modifications in the methods to be adopted provided that the financial results to the
Treasury were unaffected.    I would, ask the approval of the -Gab i net to certain modifications accordingly.I hsve to take into account the following circumstances.1.    The Police outside the Metropolitan Area are provided and maintained by the local police authorities.    They naturally compare the deductions made from their own pay with those which have been made from the pay of the employees of the authorities in the same areas.    The information I have been able to obtain indicates that those deductions, while varying considerably in different localities, have usually been,  for men of comparable status with police constables, of the order of 2 to 2-g- per cent.The London County Council have made cuts on a scale which works out at 2\% !*n  250 a year:    3x$ on  500:    5?0 on  750:    and 6k% on  1,000.    Originally no cut was made in the pay of the London Fire Brigade  (which is on a level with police pay):    but the matter has been to arbitration as regards the two lowest ranks and  as from 11th February, 1932, their pay is being cut b%, subject to overriding maxima of 5/6d. a week for sub-officers and 4/3d. for firemen.    The higher ranks were cut 5% from 1st January, 1932,The existing deduction from police pay averages 5 per cent. over the whole service   (it is about  6 per cent . for the constable at the bottom of the scale);    it is already much greater, therefore, than the usual deduction from the pay of municipal employeesj    to double it next October would create so striking an inequality as inevitably to give rise to a serious grievance.2.   While the cuts imposed by the Economy Aot w^ere made in order to relieve the Exchequer on account of the serious national situation,  one-half of the sacrifices asked from the police do not benefit the Exchequer at all, but accrue to the Local Authorities. The Cabinet are aware that the Exchequer and the Local Authorities pay for the cost of the police on e fifty-fifty basis;    the results of reductions that are made in expenditure are therefore divided between them in equsl proportions.    This is a consideration which does not apply in the case of any of the other cuts.    The police ask why they,  and they alone, should be made to pay double the amount
which is to help the national, finances,  in order that local finances may bo relieved equally with the Exchequer.3.    Soldiers,  sailors and airmen have suffered a deduction of lOper cent, on their pay in cash&apos; but their pay,  on account of rations,  lodgings, allowances, etc.,  is only about half their emoluments.     This is not so with the police.    Taking emoluments as a &quot;whole in both esses,  it will be found that the police force has already been 3ut by about the same percentage as the Defence Services, and if the policeman!s cut is to be doubled next October, he will be treated far worse than the men in those services.With regard to the teachers, the May Committee recommended a cut of 20per cent., which has been reduced to 10j    they recommended 12-g per cent, for the police, and they are now contributing 5,4.    There is one minor, but not unimportant, consideration. The police receive rent allowances  (which have been taken into account, of course,  in the calculations above);    but these allowances,  in London and many other places, are below the  scale which was  agreed to some years ago.    This is because the rents end rates actually paid by the men have gone up, while the allowances have not.    If the second instalment of the cut is enforced, a claim will certainly be made for an increase of rent allowances,  and it is difficult to see how it could be resisted. This might involve a charge upon the Exchequer of some  80,000 a year;    if the second instalment is not enforced this claim might be left in abeyance.I therefore propose the following measures-(1)    The deductions from police pay should remain at the present rates   (apart from any minor adjustments which may be recommended by the Police Council when the matter comes up for review),  and the reduced rates of pay for new entrants should also remain as at present pending the contemplated review of the whole question.(The reduction is to 55/- a week from 70/- a week on first appointment.)
H.S.HOME OPPICH:11th March,  1932.(2) Certain economies, already discussed with the Police Council should he secured by administrative measures.(3)    I should, bring before the Police Council, who have a statutory rircht to be consulted on matters affecting police pay, this proposal:    that instead of half the advantage of the present deductions from pay accruing to the Exchequer and half to the Local Authorities, the proportion should be changed to three-quarters and one-quarter respectively.    (Even that quarter will be in the nature of a windfall to the Local Authorities; and,  in almost all cases,  it will be above, or on a par with, the saving they ere effecting from deductions in the pay of their own employees).(4)    These steps will enable the Exchequer to receive in full the annual saving; previously estimated.    I would add that in point of fact the Exchequer will be receiving in 1932-33 about  300,000 more;    as, owing to a change arranged some time ago in the method of calculating the advances of police grants to the Local Authorities there will be a lag of that amount.   But this will not recur.Unless this course is pursued, the police force as a whole Is likely to feel seriously aggrieved, with the possibility of undesirable consequences .
Memorandum by Lord Trenchard Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.PJLZ__CUTS.On the 5th December,  1931,  I put before the Home Secretary a paper on the subject of Police Pay.    The question has been further considered and discussed, particularly in relation to the reactions on other Government Services  (both fighting and civil) of any decision reached,  and I would like briefly to state the position as I now see it.1.    The pay cut of 10% was divided in two in order to make it easier for the Police.This has had the effect,  as I have already pointed out, of creating an open sore which will not heal until the question of the second cut is settled.2.    The Police firmly believe that all administrative economies will be set off against the second cut next October.3.    Cw ing to changes recently made in the incidence of Income tax, one out of every two men previously exempt has now become liable, with the result that no less than two-thirds of the whole Force are now paying income tax.This is in itself a considerable contribution to the Exchequer and it gives a certain colour to the contention frequently put forward by agitators that the Police are being called upon for greater sacrifices than others .4,    Every day&apos;s delay in deciding whether the second pay cut is going to be made in full, or in part, or not made at all, reacts on the feelings of the men.    They think and talk of little else but their pay cuts, and this has of course a thoroughly bad effect on their work.    The longer the delay the greater will be the cumulative effect.    So much so that if even now they were told that the second pay cut was to be made in full, I feel that really
- 2 - 3220erious discontent would be aroused.    How far this discontent would go and how exactly it would show itself I cannot - and I think no one can - say, but one certain effect would be a falling off in efficiency and keenness at least for a time.    Police efficiency, as is obvious, depends largely on the contentment and will-to-work of each individual man.    A serious feeling of grievance easily produces a &quot;ce&quot;canny&quot; attitude and possibly something worse.    No one can possibly tell,5,    I am very loath to give the impression of wanting to run 8&apos;vay from a serious situation, but I ?m at the same time most anxious to state the position fairly as I see it for the information of the Cabinet,6.    I have considered this matter very carefully and I am well aware of the difficulties surrounding it from the point of view of the Government.    Nevertheless I suggest for their very serious consideration whether it would not be wise to wipe out the second cut altogether, on the following grounds:-(1)    The delay that has already taken place Is having a most unsettling effect.(2)    Ohher workers paid out of the rates, with whom the Police naturally compare themselves, have not been dealt with nearly so severely;    some&apos;of them,  I understand, not at all,(3)    The increased income tax contribution falls very heavily on Bailee.If however the Cabinet should decide because of the reactions on other governmental Services or for any other reason, that it is not possible or wise to agree to this proposal,  or only to  accept it in a modified form,  it will still In my view remain of the utmost importance that the Police should be informed of the decision -whatever it may be - at the earliest possible moment, as I. believe it would be a great deal easier for me to deal now with whatever&apos; situation might arise, than it would be at a later stage. 3rd February,  1932. Trenchard.
