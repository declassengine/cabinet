bs-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)E C R E T. p, 70-(3Sl&apos;G A B I IT E T.COPY NO.REPARATIONS.Record sf Conversation at Geneva on February Oth, 1952, between the Secretary of State for Foreign&apos; Affairs and Dr. Brifoing.(Circulated by direction of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,)I had an hour&apos;s interview with Dr. Briining today,,       He arrived from Berlin last night and is speaking at the Disarmament Conference tomorrow.       After references to my speech today (with which I gathered the German delegation 7/as net dissatisfied) and to the suggestion (which the Chancellor approves) of Mr. Henderson beooming the Chairman of the General Committee of the Conference, instead of Mr. Politis, and to the Memel question, which is coming up before the Council of the League tomorrow (as to which he referred me to Herr von Billow), we discussed the present position of the reparations question,.     The Chancellor began by asking whether we were still negotiating with the French about it.    I said that we had at no time been seeking a separate agreement with the French, but that we had been carrying on discussions with them in an effort to find a common &quot;basis for the Reparations Conference to which the others, including Germany, might agree. I recalled that we had put forward the enquiry whether Germany would not consent, in connection with the holding of the Reparations Conference, to a further suspension-sion of reparations on the same terms as at present,, involving the continuance of the Hoover mechanism.     Dr. Brilning said that he quite appreciated that this was * not a suggestion which we had put forward as from ourselves, but was enly an enquiry to ascer-tain the German point of view-       I pointed out that agreement-on this head might have secured the prompt holding of the Conference, on terms acceptable to the French, but that, if this was an arrangement to which Germany would
not consent, the alternative to he considered was an effort by the Creditor Powers to forego any performance by Germany of her obligations under the Young Plan for a short period, with a view to reaching a permanent arrangement later.    This alternative, however, required the assent of France just as the one I had first mentioned required the assent of Germany. As the necessary assent was not forthcoming in either case we had reached an impasse on this head and much regretted it. There still remained the possibility of at any rate agreeing the time and place of the meeting of the Separations Conference and as no better arrangement seemed possible,  it would be something gained to have it agreed that the Conference should take place in June before the end of the Hoover year.      Even then it might be a difficult matter to settle the scope to be covered by the Conference.      Britain had no intention of allowing the discussions to be involved with the question of debts to America.      I told Dra Briining that I had recently heard the suggestion that the German Government were meditating the making of some statement of their position to the French and other Governments in advance of any possible meeting in June.      How did this matter stand?    The Chancellor replied that they had this course in mind, but had not decided definitely upon it.      I told him that I had not had the opportunity of consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer or my colleagues in the Cabinet, but that my present impression was that it was an undesirable course for it would do no good and could only serve to produce irritation and perhaps a counter-statement.      Did I understand rightly that Dr.  Bruning was contemplating the private communication of such a statement
to the Creditor PoT^ers or v.ould the statement he made &apos; public?     The Chancellor said that the communication if made, would be private and he explained the object he had in view as follows0      Germany would be running some risk if it said and    did nothing until Jun6 and appeared to acquiesce in the delay in holding   -the Reparations Conference so that the meeting would only fake place just before July 1st.      He was afraid that the French might, in their ingenious and logical way, p.rgue that Germany&apos;s acquiescence was a proof of her intention to disregard the Young Plan and destroy its basis.      He had information that some French reservists had been secretly recalled to specialist services like tanks and that plans had been considered which might indicate that a movement into the Rhineland was contemplated.      He must therefore be very careful not to make a slip and expose Germany to the charge he had indicated,      I said that it seemed to me that a great deal would have to take place before such extreme measures   could be in contemplation.     Would there not haveA.to be an appeal to The Hague Tribunal and was not the Bale Report a very effective argument if the question of Germany&apos;s deliberate intention to destroy the Young Plan was to be raised?      The Chancellor agreed and added that if there was any question of appealing to the Hague Tribunal, Germany would go there first rather than be taken there by France. He went on to urge that Germany&apos;s economic position was getting steadily worse;    his public opinion would resent it if the German Government did nothing.    I replied that I did not see how the secret communication to Franco and the other Governments of a document which was not to be published could /-        f..-V-&apos;&apos; I: - &apos; V  &apos;;&apos;
o Ipossibly either assist the economic recovery of Germany or soothe German public opinion.,     Dr. Brxining met this obvious criticism by saying that he might publish the fact that -Germany had made a statement of her position to the Creditor Powers without making known the contents of the statement. Our conversation was broken off at this point and I told the Chancellor that I shculd like to send a report on this subject to London, especially as there would be a Cabinet on Wednesday morning.    The Chancellor, on hearing that I expected to be at Geneva till the end of the week, said that in that case Herrvon Bi!ilow would stay here also.    He himself must return to Berlin tomorrow (Tuesday) night, but after his speech at the Conference tomorrow morning he hoped there might be the opportunity for a further conversation with me.(intld.-,)    J.3.GENEVA,
