-iis eociment is the p.riOPERTY OF HI?J BfllTAKNIC KA.JESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.SECRET.COPY I\70CP. 84 (32).CABINET.AIMINISTRATION OP TRANSITIONAL PAYMENTS!;.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour,1.My colleagues may remember that under the Order in Counciltransitional payments are administered by Local Authorities, and the Exchequer pays the whole cost.      The protection for the Exchequer is contained in the requirement that the Authority shall apply, broadly, the same practice to an applicant for transitional payments as they would apply to an applicant for outdoor relief whose relief would be a charge upon the local rates, the amount allowed in no case exceeding the benefit rate; and secondly,  in the provision that in the event of an Authority not carrying out its duties, or carrying them out inefficiently, the Minister of Labour should have power to appoint other persons to perform those duties.      There is no intermediate power nf surcharge.2.     While the administration is settling down generally in the country a difficult situation has developed in South //ales, in parts of Durham, and in parts of one or two other counties and county boroughs.      In these areas there is a definite disregard of the requirements of the Order, not in technical matters of detail, but violating flagrantly and deliberately the principle that assistance should be given only according to need.      With the help of the Inspectors of the Ministry of Health suitable advice and admonition has been given to the erring Authorities;  some of them have mended their ways, but a few are still persisting in a disregard of the law so complete that it would be impossible to condone it any longer.      It cannot be expected that local.
2r^W Cj- tJ)Authorities in other areas who are applying the law reasonably in the face of a certain amount of local disapproval, whioh in fact is rapidly quikfcening    down as Authorities get into their stride,  should continue to perform their dubies if the elected members of the Committees are taunted with the fact that in other areas Authorities are adopting very different standards known, and admitted to be illegal, and are escaping from the interference of the government    I have had several protests on this point from important Authorities. 3c     At   my request the Assistant General Inspector of the Ministry of Health made a report upon the work of the Bridgend Guardians Committee, a Committee of the Glamorgan County Council, where we had reason to believe that the disregard of the law was particularly flagrant.    The report consists mainly of an analysis of the treatment of a large number of cases, and I do not think I need trouble my colleagues with its perusal.    It establishes beyond dispute that the Bridgend Guardians are not complying with the requirements of the Order in Council,  that their failure to do so is not due to any misunderstanding or to a reasonable difference of judgment as to the treatment of applicants, but to o deliberate and thorough violation of the Order.      In particular they are paying practically no regard to the.income of the house-hold,  and whatever latitude may be allowed without undue risk on other questions,  it is obviously of first important? that,  if the principle of assistance according to need, is to be maintained at all,  the income of the household shall be taken properly into accountn
40     While the Bridgend Guardians Committee may attempt to sheltei1 themselves behind the Public Assistance Committee for the county; who have passed an illegal resolution with regard to transitional, payments, I am advised that I con supersede cne Guardians Committee without necessarily having to take action against the parent body*    I propose, therefore, to forward to the County Council a copy of the report, and to tell them explicitly that unless they take steps at once to secure compliance with the law by the Bridgend Guardians, I shall have no alternative hut to appoint other persons to do the work in Bridgend.      I must make it clear that this would not he a supersession of a Local Authority in all its public assistance functions, as had to be undertaken in West Ham, Chester-le-Street and Bedweilty;    it would merely remove from the Authority the functions imposed by the Order in Council in regard to transitional payments in one district of the County,    I am also taking up with the County Council the question of their- illegal resolution,,    If the County Council undertake to come into line, they would of course be given a reasonable time in which to show that their actions conform to their intention,5U      I am advised that the probabilities are that this course of action should have a salutary effect, not only in Bridgend, but upon the County Authority of Glamorgan, and it is hoped that they will decide to behave more sensibly. If so,  it will have valuable re-actions upon the county of Monmouth which is behaving at least as badly.    It will also indicate to the Committees in the counts^ of Durham and In some of the county boroughs that if the ordinary administrative methods of discussion and persuasion fail, the Government will not hesitate to use the power to protect the Exchequer which the Order in Council expressly conferred upon the Minister of Labour-.
6*      On the other hand the risk must he faced that if I have ultimately to appoint other persons to perform the duties of the Bridgend Guardians Committee on transitional payments, the Glamorgan County Public Assistance Committee and possibly some other Committees may decide to refuse to continue the administration of the scheme^    I do not at present rate this risk very highs hut in fairness to the very large majority of Authorities who are helping the Government,  if the challenge is given I think we have no option but to take it up0    I think such action,  if it occursj  is likely to be confined to Guardians Committees$ and would not extend to the Countjr Authorities, nor do I expect that any County Borough would go on strike because they are asked to ccmply with the law in a reasonable manner,7.      I ask, therefore; for the approval of my colleagues -(a) to write as proposed in the case of Bridgend;(b) to a decision that similar action should be taken in other areas v/here the Authority declines to act reasonably.8.      Before I proceed to the appointment of persons to perform the work in any area, I should bring the matter again before the Cabinet.(Intd.)      H.B.86th February,  1952,
