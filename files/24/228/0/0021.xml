SECRET. CAB I HE T. COPY Ho.SKY-WRIT IHG .....CP.71(32)yMemorandum by the Home Secretary.A new invention which makes possible the casting of advertisements upon the sky bjr the projection of powerful lights has recently attracted considerable public attention, and I desire to obtain the opinion of ray colleagues as to what steps,  if any,  should be taken by the Government to deal with a. matter which, if exploited for commercial purposes, might become a serious public nuisance.A number of letters from eminent persons and public bodies have appeared in the Press protesting against the vulgarisation of the sky by advertisements;    a letter has also been received from the Royal Pine Art Commission urging that the use of the invention should be strictly controlled by the Government.Ordinary outdoor advertising is already subject to control under local byelaws made under the Advertisements Regulation Acts, and in some cases local authorities have obtained special powers to deal with it under local Acts or provisions included in Town Planning; Schemes;    but I am advised that none of these measures can be used for prohibiting or regulating advertisements in the sky.The preservation of amenities is not, however,  the -only question involved.     The use of the invention concerns the Defence Departments and has been under their consideration.The Air Ministry take the view that an indiscriminate use of the invention may become a serious danger to air navigation,  especially for less experienced pilots  (who are increasing in number) .     Except for this they take an entirelyneutral/&amp;iis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty &apos;:s Government.
neutral attitude.      If it were thought desirable on other grounds to prohibit the invention,  they would have no objection from the narrow angle of air navigation:    if it is permitted, then it may become necessary to regulate it, possibly on the lines of confining it to populous cities already brightly illuminated.If it were thought necessary to limit its use in this way,  their procedure would be by an Air navigation Order Under the Air lTa.viga.tion Act, 1920,  prohibiting its use except under licence.      There is, however,  some doubt whether such an Order would be strictly within the powers given to the Air Minister by the statute.      (in deciding whether or not to grant a. licence they would have regard solely to questions of safety and not to the preservation of amenities).If, however, a statutory control  (under licence) were set up by the Hons Office, the Air J ministry&apos;s requirements would be fully met by applications being referred to them for concurrence.      In their view this would be the proper course to adopt.The War Office are investigating the invention to ascertain what value it possesses for defence purposes;    but, while recognising that the existence of a number of these searchlights would form a potential reserve of anti-aircraft equipment,  they are not sufficiently interested to be justified in intervening in the question of the corar-iercial exploitation of sky-writing.The Admiralty consider that the invention might be useful for defence purposes in certain circumstances.It is conceivable also that in a time of grave national, emergency messages flashed to the nation by sky night be of the greatest value, and it would seen inadvisable therefore to do anything precipitately which night stranglo the invention at the outset.
The position was very fairly reviewed in a letter which appeared on the 16th January in the Times,  signed by Sir Leslie Scott, ICC.&apos;, who wrote as Chairman of the Scapa Society (The Society for Checking the Abuses of Public Advertising).     While recognising that the invention may &quot;be of national importance and also of use for military purposes,  he suggested that legislation is required &quot;not &quot;blindly to prohihit  out to give full public control of the use of the new invention for commercial purposes&quot;.     He proposed that control might take the form of a licence granted &quot;by the Home Office or the Ministry of Health under statutory provisions, which would make the protection of amenity the duty of the licensing Minister; and also that the ownership of the skj- should &quot;be transferred to the Crown,  i.e.  to the nation subject to rights of user by property owners for all ordinarry purposes of property.If the invention is capable,  as it apparently is,   of being exploited for commercial purposes,  there is certain to be a popular outcry against the widespread use of the sky as an advertising medium, and it would seem desirable that adequate powers of control should &quot;be obtained &quot;before new vosted interests are  created.In my opinion the subject  calls for immediate enquiry, and the inventor himself, Major J.  C.  Savage, has asked for an opportunity of &quot;being publicly hea.rd.      I am inclined to think that the best procedure for cbtadning an impartial enquirjr would be to appoint a Select Committee of the House of Commons for the purpose .     The enquiry need not be a, lengthy one, nor raise many technical points, and the expenditure involved would be very small.It  could doubtless be arranged for the Service Departments to state their views,  if need be, in camera.      Such an enquiry would, I think,   commend itself to the House, andthere/
12th February, 1932.there are probably a number of new members who would welcome the opportunity of taking part in a piece of work of this character.I think it would also be desirable that any enquiry undertaken should include the question of &quot;Sky-Shouting&quot;. Recent inventions have apparently made it possible to magnify and broadcast human speech from air-ships and air-planes, as has been demonstrated in New York and Italy, and clearly any adaptation of this to purposes of advertising would be objectionable for much the same reasons as &apos;sky-sign writing&apos;.H.S .
