THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1932.SECRET. Copy No.    5 4367 C.(Also Paper No. O.D.C. 627-M.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.EAST AFRICA.Kings African Rifles,   Proposed Reduction in Strength,(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 366-C.)Memorandum by the Oversea Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence.IN their Memorandum No. 621-M* the Oversea Defence Committee referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence the question whether one of the two Reserve Battalions in East Africa should be dispensed with, in accordance with a proposal by the Colonial Office in consultation with the late Inspector-General, which had been made in view of the urgent need for economy in public expenditure throughout the East African territories. The Committee, while recognising that financial considerations must be given full weight, expressed the definite opinion that from the military point of view no reduction of the reserve below its present strength could be permitted without some addition to the risks necessarily run by any Government o*f a great undeveloped territory, and that the proposed reduction would diminish the present margin of safety to an extent which would not be justified.2. The Committee of Imperial Defence, at. their 254th Meeting on the 7th December, 1931, while taking note of the objection to any reduction from the defence point of view, agreed &quot; (a) to recommend that, in accordance with the proposal of the Colonial Office, one of the two reserve battalions in East Africa should be dispensed with.(b) that the question of the location of the remaining reserve battalion should be decided by the Colonial Office after consultation with the Committee of Imperial Defence or its appropriate Sub-Committee.&quot;3. Subsequently, it was suggested that the disbandment of one of the Reserve Battalions would not only break up the organisation of the King&apos;s African Rifles, but. would render expansion when required a slow and difficult process, and that the saving to be expected from the abolition of one battalion might be effected by some alternative method less objectionable from the defence point of vieAv.4. In consequence, the General Staff were requested to study possible alternative schemes, and they submitted tentative proposals giving the lines on which they thought an alternative scheme could be evolved.* 6.16*. Paper No. 366-C.[6566]
In these proposals they recommended that the scheme decided upon should be one which had the least disruptive effect on the organization of the force as a whole, and should admit of ease of expansion in time of emergency. With this in view they suggested that suitable reductions distributed throughout all the battalions would meet these requirements.5. In the circumstances, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, having asked the Inspector-General of the King&apos;s African Rifles (who is at present on tour in East Africa) for his views, invited the Oversea Defence Committee to give their opinion on the proposal, and stated that if it should be thought desirable he would also see no objection to requesting the Committee of Imperial Defence to reconsider their recommendation for the abolition of a complete Reserve Battalion.6. The views of the Inspector-General are given in the telegram which is printed as an Appendix to this Memorandum.It will be observed that the Inspector-General- considers it essential that the two Reserve Battalions should be retained intact, and suggests the following alternative scheme which he estimates would produce a saving approximately equivalent to that obtained by the elimination of one Reserve Battalion :  (i) The reduction of the machine gun companies in each battalion to oneplatoon, administered by the headquarters wing.(ii) The abolition of the extra subaltern provided by establishment for eachbattalion headquarters, (lii) The limitation of the cost of the three bands to  1,000 each.7. The Inspector-General states that these reductions would not, in his opinion, seriously affect the fighting efficiency of brigades for war, or for internal security, since they interfere neither with expansion for war nor with measures against civil disturbances. He concludes with the opinion that no further reductions in strength other than those proposed would in any circumstances be permissible.8. The Colonial Office estimate that the Inspector-Generafs scheme would produce a saving of approximately  32,000 omitting any reductions on the bands (which, in the case of Uganda has already taken place), as compared with the saving of  30,000 to  35,000 which would follow from the abolition of a complete battalion.9. The Oversea Defence Committee are definitely of opinion that since it has been decided that savings in defence expenditure equivalent to the reduction of one battalion must be effected in East Africa, the proposals of the Inspector-General outlined in paragraph 6 above are preferable to the abolition of a Reserve Battalion. It is, in their opinion, most important that when reductions are found necessary in any of the limited defence forces in the Empire, they should be carried out in such a way as to have the least disruptive effect on the existing organisation, and so facilitate rapid expansion in time of emergency. The disbandment of one of the Reserve Battalions would not only break up the organisation of the King&apos;s African Rifles, but would render expansion when required a difficult and slow process. They therefore recommend that the Committee of Imperial Defence should reconsider the decision reached at their 254th Meeting, and approve the alternative proposal made by the Inspector-General.10. In submitting this recommendation, the Committee feel it their duty once again to submit that, in their opinion, any reduction in the present strength of the^King&apos;s African Rifles, though rendered necessary on financial grounds, must result in reducing the present margin of safety in East Africa to an extent which may prove to be unwise, and they earnestly hope that the Committee of Imperial Defence will agree that as soon as conditions permit, the King&apos;s African Rifles should be restored to the existing establishments.11. In conclusion, the Committee would invite attention to a point of detail connected with recruiting. The proposals for reduction now advocated, applying as they do to all battalions in the King&apos;s African Rifles, will result in a diminution
217of the forces available for employment throughout East Africa, whereas under the original proposal previously approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence it was intended to disband the 6th (Tanganyika) Battalion, which is recruited wholly in Tanganyika and, according to the terms of the Mandate, cannot be employed outside that territory. In view of the very small military forces maintained in East Africa, the Committee consider it essential that all units should be available for use wherever trouble may occur, and they therefore suggest for consideration that in future recruits for the 6th Battalion of the King&apos;s African Rifles should be drawn from territories other than Tanganyika. They understand that there is no obligation under the Mandate to recruit any natives in Tanganyika.(Signed)G. N.

APPENDIX.Telegram from the Governor of Kenya to the Secretary of State for the Colonies,dated January 20, 1932.(Received 11 - 34 a.m., January 20, 1932.)No. 15.   Following from Inspector-General, K.A.R. : Begins: I. consider retention of intact Reserve Battalions in both Brigades essential. I am unable entirely to concur in War Office alternative proposal because practical difficulties in connection with distribution of troops for internal security prevent possibility of reduction in number of rifle platoons in non-reserve Battalions of Brigades. As alternative course I suggest following reductions which are approximately equivalent to the cost of elimination of one Reserve Battalion. In view of mechanisation of machine guns it is now possible to handle in emergency same number of machine guns with half the number of men required for ground work. I therefore recommend reducing machine-gun companies of all Battalions to one platoon administered by Headquarters Wing. This is reduction of six machine-gun company headquarters and six machine-gun platoons. Limitation of cost of three bands to  1,000 each. Abolition of extra subaltern(s) provided by establishment for each Battalion Headquarters. Elimination of Reserve Battalion would save  35,250 alternative savings recommended above amount to  35,580. After careful consideration of all questions affected I consider that these reductions will not seriously affect fighting efficiency of Brigades for war or for internal security because they interfere with neither expansion for war nor measures against civil disturbances. Consider that it is essential that no further reductions in strength other than those mentioned now by me are in any circumstances permissible.   Ends.)o
