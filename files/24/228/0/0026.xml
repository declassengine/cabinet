Copy No.........&apos;./. .CABINET.Reports by jLocal Governments on the Political Situation in India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly reports from the Local Governments in India.S. H.India Office, 16th February 1932.Government of India.Delhi reports a decrease in agitation, and the employment of Red Shirts from the-frontier for picketing.2. This \veek&apos;s reports indicate improvement in the following respects : (a) Improvement in Peshawar district and very satisfactory situation in the-other districts of the North-West Frontier Province.(b) Sustained improvement in the United Provinces, confirming the view that agitation is now definitely on the decrease. The no-rent campaign has been practically abandoned.(c) Indication that apex has been reached in several other Provinces, for instance, in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, Central Provinces and the Punjab.(d) The situation in Bombay Presidency is very satisfactory and in Bombay city there is some indication of improvement.(e) Very few instances of violence.3. A new feature is the hiring of Red Shirts from the Frontier Province for picketiag elsewhere. The chief Congress activity is now the boycott, which, as expected, is achieving some measure of success. Underground agitation continues, but at present gives little cause for anxiety.4. The situation in Kashmir and Jamrnu is much easier, but reactions ou communal feeling in British India, especially in the Punjab, are more marked and are-potentially dangerous.Bombay.The situation in Bombay city and the Mofussil districts continues quiet, with few demonstrations and very little open Congress activity generally. Several districts are reported to be practically free from agitation. One attempted meeting was dispersed by a mild lathi charge in Poona. A few cases of toddy tree cutting and forest satyagraha are reported from Belgaum, but not on a serious scale. One telegraph wire was cut in Belgaum. Land revenue is coming in satisfactorily. Some picketing of cloth shops, markets and the Mint continued in Bombay city, and at the Exchange Banks since the 10th. There were 15 picketers at the Mint during the week, all of whom were arrested. The Stock Exchange remained open with business going on normally. Bombay municipal elections passed off peacefully and the usual number of votes were recorded. Action under Emergency Powers Ordinance :  Number arrested under section 3 was 66, and number of orders issued under section 4 was 260 during the week. The total number detained under section 3 is 477. The total number of orders issued under section 4 is 888. Arrests for breach of orders under section 4 during the week number 71. Congress funds amounting to Rs. 2,268 were forfeited under Ordinance 4.Madras.The situation is unchanged. There have been no serious incidents and few signs of civil disobedience activity. Sporadic picketing and a campaign of misrepresentation in certain sections of the Press are the chief current.i&apos;eatures. Two more associations, have been declared unlawful, making a total of 108. Apologies are beginning to-come in from persons convicted, which are being considered on their merits.699      60   2.32
-Bengal.i -During the week the civil disobedience movement has heen definitely waning in -Calcutta Presidency, Dacca and Chittagong Divisions. Rajshahi Division is quiet,, but there is still spasmodic activity in Pahna District and Gaibandba Sub-division, Rangpur. No report has been received from Burdwan Division. The principal actors continue to be youths and boys. Arrests, section 3, Calcutta, nil; orders- under section 4, 10.   Statistics for other areas are incomplete.Punjab.There has been a marked improvement throughout the Province. Though there have heen arrests in 13 districts, interference with trade has been negligible. Open &apos;Congress activities have ceased in Amritsar, and are comparatively insignificant in Lahore, where the number of arrests has heen swollen by the advent of 2S red-shirted &quot;Congressite Pathans, who deliberately desired arrest here. Though traders have not been seriously inconvenienced and the Id sales were brisk, nevertheless forward hookings have dropped considerably, partly due to the sympathy of traders with the Swadeshi movement, and partly to the close of the winter season, the end of the marriage season, trade depression, and to some uncertainty as to the future. The centre of public interest has shifted from Congress activities to the Kashmir disturbances, which are seriously increasing communal tension and provoking attacks on the Government. Arrests for political activities under the ordinary law were 48 ; under Ordinances, 89 ; the totals to date being 178 and 354, respectively. There has heen one fresh arrest only under section 3, Emergency Ordinance, making; the- total to date 4, all of whom are terrorists. Four orders have been issued under section 4, making the total to date 31.   Total under restraint for infraction of such orders, 7.United Provinces.General improvement continues,, with the exception of Allahabad and Cawnpore -cities, and the districts of Allahabad, Fatehpur and Farrukhabad. Conditions are now approaching normal. No case in which firearms have been used was reported. A bomb was thrown in Azamgarh town on 6th February, presumably by a revolutionary. Non-payment of rent is seldom mentioned. Muslims generally have refrained from demonstrations or references to the North-West Frontier Province on Alvida. Convictions duriug the week under Ordinances number 164 ; under ordinary law, 770 ; total convictions to date, 4,473 ; released on apologies, 772.

The situation iis quieter.In Bangalore there have been 88 convictions to date, and seven more arrests since the last report. Situation quiet. Emergency Powers Ordinance has not been extended to Bangalore or Coorg.North-West Frontier Province.The first results of the efforts to revive agitation after the Id were attempts to convene big meeting at the Charsadda area during the last two days, which the police frustrated. Underground agitation in a few areas continues, but the general situation in the Peshawar district has considerably improved, and in other districts is very satisfactory.In the trans-frontier area, the Nawab of Dir has made a somewhat unsatisfactory settlement with the Painda Khel, and the proposed air action has heen cancelled. Some excitement and talk of a jehad continues in Bajaur, but there is no sign of action at present. Other tribes are quiet. Under section 3 arrests during the week, nil ; total detained, 1,797.

219!Central Provinces.Except for some activity in Chattisgarh, the situation is easier every where,, and the Congress appears to have gone to ground. The Molestation Ordinance has been applied to Bhandara and punitive police have been sent to Hinganghat. Prosecutions 181, convictions 129.Burma.There is very little of interest to report. Satisfactory progress continues to be made, and one important leader has been killed in Maubin district. No casualties are reported among Government forces. Twenty-nine under-trials have been released, and the number remaining in custody is 4.19. The price of paddy has risen during week to about 96. Satisfactory progress continues to be made in the collection of taxes.   The number of persons on relief works is about 8,400.Ajmer Merwara.Nine persons have been arrested during the week under section 17, Criminal Law Amendment Act. There is little life left in the movement in the district, and youthf ul volunteers recruited elsewhere are mostly responsible for such little activity as exists. A few such volunteers have been arrested for ineffective attempts to picket -cloth shops in Ajmer.   The frontier and other clays have excited little interest.Assam.There has been little change during the past week in the Sadr and Sunamganj Sub-divisions of Sylhet. Anti-Government propaganda and attempts to defy orders are still prevalent. Picketing and enrolment of volunteers are on the increase in the Assam Valley. Thefts of four guns were reported in Sylhet during past month, probably for purposes of political dacoity.
