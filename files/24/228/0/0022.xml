Memorandum &quot;by the Hone Secretary.The legalisation of sweepstakes in the Irish Free State, and the consequences that have followed in Great Britain, have raised a question which is too large to &quot;be considered departmentally by the Home Office and to which I must invite the attention of the Cabinet.Four sweepstakes have so far been held under official auspices in the Irish Free State in the period from Hovember, 1930,  to November,  1931,  inclusive.     From the best information available,   it appears that about 59,000,000 has been subscribed to them.      Of this,  about  5,400,000 was returned in prises;    about  2,400,000 was spent in expenses, including the heavy commission paid to the sellers of tickets;    and about  2,000,000 was given to Irish hospitals.The net sum contributed from Great Britain to Ireland in that period, after allowing for the prize money distributed here, has been in the neighbourhood of  2,000,000 (This estimate rests on the assumption that the tickets bought in Great Britain are in proportion to the prizes won. It is known how much prize-money has been won In Great Britain, and it can be calculated from that how many tickets have been bought and how much -money has been subscribed.)This transfer of funds from Great Britain to Ireland is increasing in amount.     Each, sweepstake has been on a larger scale than the previous one,  and there is no sign that the business is coming to an end.     On the contrary, the sweepstakes are breeding a prolific swarm of smaller lotteries,  each established for the purpose of buying/
buying tickets in one of the large sweepstakes, ostensibl.y for the promotion of some social object.The law on the subject is clear enough.     All public lotteries of whatever form, wherever promoted,  and for whatever purpose, are illegal in this country.      There have always been, of course, practical difficulties in administering the law,  but these have in the past been mainly concerned with distinguishing between public and private lotteries (a private lottery has by long established convention been regarded as immune from police interference);    or with deciding in a particular case whether a sufficient element of skill 1ms been introduced to take the transaction outside the category of a lottery.     Parliament has frequently been informed of the legal position,  and my predecessors have taken occasion from time to time to explain the administrative policy pursued by the authorities in endeavouring to apply the law.With respect to the Irish sweepstakes, every endeavour has been made by the authorities to enforce the law, but it must be admitted that these attempts have failed.      In addition to the practical difficulties experienced in bringing offenders to account,   the Courts have in general shown themselves reluctant to co-operate in a strict enforcement of the law.     Even though prosecutions have been confined mainly to those engaged in the organised selling of tickets,  the penalties imposed by the Courts have in most cases &quot;been derisory.In July last the promoters of the Irish sweepstakes made tentative and unofficial approaches to ray predecessor with a view to seeing whether some solution could he found of &quot;the difficulties which were being caused by the measures taken by us to prevent the illegal sale of tickets in this country.      They had been advised that it was legal forpers ons/
persons resident in the United Kingdom to apply for and to receive tickets in lotteries promoted outside the United Kingdom,  and that the law was infringed only &quot;by the sale in this country of tickets in such lotteries.      They suggested that,  if this interpretation of the law were correct, they could so arrange matters as to prevent any breaches of the law in future.      In reply the true legal position was explained to them, and they were informed by Mr. Clynes that in his view the only satisfactory solution would be for the Irish hospitals to refuse to receive subscriptions from or on behalf of persons in this country or to send tickets to this country.     Since then,  the Irish hospital authorities have made no further approaches.Such being the present situation,  the possible courses, and their respective advantages (which are few)  and disadvantages (which are many)  seem to be these.(l)    To propose a general change in the law, and to legalise sweepstakes and lotteries under such restrictions as it might be possible to devise.      The difficulty of framing adequate safeguards would be almost insuperable, and a change in the law would probably be followed by an immense increa.se in gambling among all classes.      The necessary legislation would be vehemently opposed and would prove controversial in the highest degree.(2)    To leave things as they are, making what is little more than a pretence to enforce the law, and submitting in fact to its open evasion.      In consequence of the attitude adopted by the magistrates, the police throughout the country are showing a growing reluctance to prosecute in these cases. They have to incur considerable expense, and even where a conviction is obtained,  the defendant is usually discharged without penalty, or on payment of a few shillings towards the cost of the prosecution.     As matters stand,  the administrationof/
of the law is heing brought into open contempt.(3)    To diminish even the present modest efforts at enforcement,  e.g. by altering the existing rule, which is to prosecute where  10 worth of tickets are being sold,  paid raising the figure to  20,  or by ceasing to iss&quot;ue warrants to examine correspondence sent by post to known agents. This would make official intervention rare in practice, but would not formally surrender the principle.(4)  To proceed one step further,  and publicly declaring that the law is unenforceable, to abandon all attempts to prevent the sale of tickets.      The practical effect of this would be the same as the effect of a formal legalisation of lotteries,  and the social consequences would be those described under the first alternative .(5)    To take the opposite course, and to prosecute vigorously in all cases.      This would be futile,  unless,  by the influence of a changed public opinion,  the Courts could be induced to alter their present attitude.(6)    To approach the matter from the standpoint of the financial position of the country,  and to seek a means of stopping the financial drain from Great Britain to the Irish Free State,  which may soon amount to  2,000,000 a year.      This suggestion was made by Lord Snowden, when Chancellor of the Exchequer,  and it lias  since been the subject of discussions between the Treasury and the Home Office.      If any;measures were taken in this direction,  they would take the form of prohibiting under heavy penalties participation in lotteries or sweepstakes organised outside this country,  possibly with confiscation of the prizes.      The justification would be that it is inexpedient, on account of the present conditions relating to the balance of payments,  to permit the continuance of this drain..      I understand, however,  that the Chancellorof/
of the Exchequer does not favour this course.(7)    To make an appeal to the public on patriotic grounds not to spend this large sum outside Great Britain,  for reasons similar to those which have led many people to forego taking their holidays abroad.      The figures given at the beginning of this memorandum,  if they were published, would probably have considerable influence.(8)    To approach the Irish Free State Government with a view to securing a discontinuance of the sweepstakes. I understand that there is a considerable,  and growing,  volume of opinion in Ireland which VTeuld welcome their discontinuance but whether there is any prospect that this would outwejgh the factors on the other side, I do not know.     Mr.  de Valera is reported to have stated that he would not abolish them.(9)    To hold an inquiry into the whole subject of betting and gambling, possibly by a Royal Commission.      This would, of course,  be an evasion of the immediate issue.      The inquiry would probably take a long time;    it would b- unlikely to result in any unanimous report;    meanwhile an active,  and possibljr a bitter,   controversjr would be aroused.In this choice of unsatisfactory alternatives,  I should be inclined to recomaend to the Cabinet that the possibilities of (6) and (7) should be more closely examined.H.
