THE SHIPBUILDING EMPLOYERS1 FEDERATION.DEPUTATION TO THE RIGHT HON. WALTER RUNCIMAN, PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF trade. 19TH JANUARY, 1932.1. *vs you are aware we met your predecessor at the Board of Trade. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, on the 29th oeptember last prior to the Election;  and explained to him the attitude of ship-builders and ship-repairers to the question of tariffs.2. It seemed to us however to be a duty that we should put the position of our Industry before you personally before the Government came to any final decision on general policy in regard to the tariff question.3. &quot;&apos;7e accordingly are grateful for this opportunity of doing so.4. The case that we have to put before you to-day is essentially the same as we put to Bir Philip Cunliffe-Lister.5. &quot;7e understand that the records of that meeting are before you, and we would not propose to go into all the points then raised in as much detail as we did on that occasion, unless you would wish us to do so.6. Nothing that has happened since the end of September has altered in any way our view that it would be disastrous to us as an Industry - and to the Country as a whole - if a general scheme of tariffs was introduced which die not maize special provision for shipbuilding and ship-repairing.7. As regards the general question whether there should be any tariff at all, ship-builders in common with other industrialists have had to recognise the changes which the war and the post-war years have imposed on world trading arid on this Country - and they have no desire to take a narrow view of the general situation - or to attempt to oppose what
they recognise to be a view now very commonly held by other industries that tariffs in some form are necessary.8. But even those shipbuilders who are prepared to accept the principle of tariffs for the Country differ in regard to the precise form of the general tariff which would best serve the industrial needs of this Country.9. And all of them are definite in the view that special consideration must be given to shipbuilding and ship-repairing.10. You are yourself so familiar with the problems of shipping and shipbuilding that there is no danger of you mistaking this view for one of industrial selfishness -throughout all our considerations of the subject our Federation have endeavoured to take the broad national view.11. The fact that they no longer offer any general opposition to the idea of a tariff is in itself proof of this - for in the past shipbuilding, like shipping, has been essentially a Free Trade Industry.12. To-day however we must necessarily concentrate on the position of shipbuilding and ship-repairing.13. we agree whole-heartedly with the general views you yourself expressed in the House of Commons on the 9th   December regarding the necessity of examining this difficult question in all its bearings, and not being led away by the difficulties of particular industries.14. In the weeks before Christmas our friends the Steel Makers were very vocal in their demands for immediate protection.15. we would not wish to minimise in any way the difficulties of their position - but the Shipbuilding Industry has gone through even greater depths of depression than the Steel Makers in recent years - our unemployment figures are higher - and we need consideration as much as - if not more than - they do.16. At the same time we do not dispute the argument that British Shipbuilding and British Steelmaking have very much in
common - and that Britain without its Steel Industry would probably not long require ships.17. On the other hand Britain without shipping and shipbuilding would not long survive as an industrial country of any importance - and there would then be no need for the Steel Makers.18. The Steel Makers have themselves always recognised the exceptional position of Shipbuilding.19. In connection with their application for the marking of imported steel under the Merchandise Marks Act they agreed -as the result of negotiations - to exclude from their application all shipbuilding steel.20. The position in regard to shipbuilding steel is of course exceptional in that the steel is traced from the furnace by the Classification Societies - even when imported - and is therefore readily identified.21. During last year when we found ourselves faced with a difference of as much as  3 per ton in the price of home and imported steel for shipbuilding work, we made representations to the Steel Makers - as a result they agreed to the provision of a special discount fund for reducing the price of shipbuilding steel - in addition to the Rebate Scheme.22. Since September v/e have had discussions vith the Steel iiakers on the question of tariffs - these discussions are still proceeding.23. The Steel Makers in discussions in December indicated their recognition of the common interests of the Shipbuilders and the Steel Makers, and the need in any scheme of tariffs for special consideration being given to the Shipbuilders&apos; position.24. &apos;-le have not yet got beyond the point in our present discussions on tariffs of agreeing that special consideration must be given in any scheme of tariffs to the exceptional
position of our Industry - a Committee has heen appointed to go further into the matter - which is expected to meet to-morrow.25. The recognition by the Steel Makers of the need for special consideration being given to the Shipbuilders&apos; position in any scheme of tariffs is in our view a point of very great importance - particularly in relation to the representations which the Steel Makers have made to the Government.26. &quot;While arrangements have been made for further discussions with the Steel Makers our idea of what the special consideration should be remains as it was when we saw your predecessor.27. we say that all shipbuilding materials - not merely steel, though steel would be included - should be exempted from import duties of whatever kind or amount.28. 7e recognise that exemption, particularly in connection with the introduction of a tariff, may involve practical problems in administration.29. &apos;7e therefore are quite prepared to accept the alternative method of collection and subsequent repayment -applicable of course whether the ship is for a home owner or for another flag-30. 7e do not believe that any administrative difficulties exist which could not be met,  even in the early days of an emergency or revenue tariff.31. Even if there are difficulties of that kind we think they should be faced - and that the principle of exemption or repayments should be admitted from the first.32. Our claim for exemption or repayment of duties on shipbuilding materials is not because we do not want so far as possible to buy British.33. Even in the case of steel, 95% of the steel plates and sections we use at the moment are British - and the Steel
Makers cannot therefore argue in the case of shipbuilding steel that a prohibitory tariff would assist them by increasing thftir output.34. &quot;We have had no discussions with any of our other suppliers except the Steel Makers, and the numbers of such suppliers is so great as to make individual discussion impossible.35. There is no necessity to repeat tc you the arguments we previously used in regard to the ceaseless competition which ships must face from other countries.36. It is the confirmed policy ox British Shipbuilders that they must be able to supply and maintain for British Shipowners ships that in efficiency and price will enable them to compete.37. In the past we have also been able to build substantially for other countries - the export of ships has been quite an important part of the Country^ export trade.38, Already competition is most intense in all kinds of international shipbuilding and ship-repairing work.39. Let me quote one case that came to our notice to-day -the case of a ship recently built in this Country for a foreign government, the price of which would be in the neighbourhood of  200,000.40. Prices quoted in this Country for castings, forgings, condenser tubes, gearing, boiler tubes and other similar items, exceeded the continental costs by no less than  15,000..     The contract was secured on the basis of the continental prices -otherwise it is very unlikely the ship would have been built in this   Country at all.     Actually some of the home manufacturers - rather than lose the orders to the continent -reduced their prices to approximately continental level -the other orders went abroad.
41. Recently we have been able to attract practically no warship work for other countries because of the subsidised competition of other shipbuilding countries, particularly Italy.42. Similar difficulties have been experienced in regard to merchant work which is open to international competition -though not to the same extent as on warships.43. Any general increase in prices under a tariff would hit shipbuilding and ship-repairing   particularly hard as being largely an assembling industry.44. We believe that there is no Industry whose product is in quite the same position as shipbuilding - ships are different from every other industrial output in that they are engaged on the high seas in continuous international competition45. British ships must be able to compete with ships built and owned in other countries - which have had the advantage of free importation of materials or repayments - except where the less desirable method of subsidies exists.46. Shipowning and Shipbuilding mean more to Britain as a Country and as an   Empire than to any other country in the world.47. We can find no alternative to exemption or repayment of duties which would ensure the same results.48. We have never wanted tariffs on ships or on repairs - we believe that they also should be free from duty - but we think it a national necessity that British Shipowners should not require to go abroad either for their ships or for their repairs49. The recent monetary changes involving the departure from gold has so far affected us comparatively little.50. It might have been anticipated that as a result additional orders from other countries would have been obtained but the entirely abnormal conditions - both monetary and industrial - ruling throughout the world have resulted in an almost complete absence of orders of any kind.
51. The effect of going off gold in this respect has therefore still to be tested so far as shipbuilding is concerned.52. In the meantime the cost of our materials generally has tended to go slightly up.53. The effect of the change so far has therefore been detrimental rather than helpful to us.54. Certainly nothing that has happened in regard to the  . has caused us to alter our ideas as to the only possible course in regard to the interests of the Industry and of the Country in relation to tariffs.55. Ve are still quite definite that the only proper course is to exclude shipbuilding materials of all kinds, or alternatively to levy the import duties subject to subsequent repayment.
