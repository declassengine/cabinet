&apos;fTTS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAJ-JNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMErrT....... Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour.1.      I have been asked once or twice in the House to state the policy of the Government with regard to the ratification of the Washington Hours Convention.    Up to the present I have avoided giving a definite answer but as these questions will certainly be repeated and pressed, I wish to let my colleagues know the line which, if they agree,  I propose to take. In this connection,  I should call attention also to the separate memorandum which I am circulating today with regard to the Convention on Hours of Work in Commerce and Offices;    a document which is in effect complementary to the Washington Hours Conventions which deals with id^tjea?-establishments.2.      I imagine that all my colleagues are more or less familiar with the main features of this questions and therefore I do not propose to recapitulate its history even in outline,. Suffice it to say that the last Conservative administration pressed for the revision of the Convention, and even went so far as to submit to the Governing Body of the International Labour Office a detailed, list of the points on which the Convention in their view required modificatlono    In spite of every effort the proposal for revision was rejected by the Governing Body in March 19S9 and the Government went out of Office shortly afterwards.    The Labour Government, in pursuance of a long standing pledge announced their intention to ratify the Convention and to introduce legislation for this purpose without delay*    The Hours of Industrial Employment Bill was introduced on the 16th April 1930 and re-introduoed on theCAB IN E T.SECRET.WASHINGTON HOURS CCjWENTION..P. 79(32):.:-.
13th November hut up to the time when the Labour Government went out of Office it had not been put down for a second reading,S.      This Bill was considered by the Law Officers of the time to be within the four corners of the Washington Hours Convention? but they would probably have admitted that in regard to several points there was at least a tenable view that the previsions of the Convention had been exceeded. Moreover? the Bill was not popular with certain importantTrade Unions because to a certain extent it ran counter to established industrial practices valued by the workers, or at least would give the employers an opportunity of appealing to the provisions of the Statute if they wished to change those practices,0    but apart from these difficulties it is clear that thwre was no pressure from any substantial part of the community put upon the Government to give priority to the Bill or to hasten the ratification of the International Convention,4.      Such pressure as there was, emanated from Geneva and in his report to the International Labour Conference In 1931 the Director of the International Labour Office took the Government severely to task for their failure to press on with the Hours Bill.    In rebutting this charge at the Conference the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour announced that if nothing unforeseen happened it was the intention of the Government to get the Bill through and that arrangements would be made in the next Session for that to be done.    Actually, of course, the unforeseen did happen, and the Bill lapsed.
5.      It is in these circumstances that the National Government of today has to decide upon itc policy in regard to this Convention,  and there are, I think, three main alternative.-.! from which a choice can he made.6.      The first of these is to pursue the ratification of the Convention in its present form,    I think the experience of the past is quite sufficient without further argument from me to negative any idea cf that kind.    There is no doubt that in the Labour Party&apos;s Bill the interpretation of the Convention was stretched to Its limit and it night well he that the present Law Officers would take a different view of the relation of certain provisions in the Bill (without which it would he unworkable) to the provisions cf the Convention^.    Moreover, the lack of enthusiasm In the country for the Bill and the Convention remains unchanged and will remain unchanged unless there should he a real threat in one or nrre important industries to the principle of the 48 hour weeks    I hope I nay dismiss this alternative without further argument.    Employers here attach far more importance to wages than to hours in respect of foreign competition.7.      The second alternative io to press actively once more for the revision of the Convention.    This would,  of course, be a positive policy and would rebut the charge (if made) that the Government was doing nothing to forward the international regulation of hours cf work in industry,   bo the principle of which every Government in turn has paid its tribute.    On the whole, however,  I cannot recommend this oouree to my colleagues,,    In the first place,  if we press for revision we shall be expected to set out in detail the amendments that we should wish to see introduced into theSo
text.    I &quot;believe the truth to be that the shortcomings of the Washington Convention cannot he cured by textual amendment,, What is really needed is that fin International Conference should sit down and work out a new Convention from the start. Equally3  if a serious attempt is made to formulate the amendments which are really required to put the Convention right It will be found that practically no Article of substance remains intact,,    It would then be argued with some truth that what we were asking was not a limited revision cf the Convention but that the whole Convention should he put into the melting pot.    Tc this the Workers&apos;  Group whether in the Governing Body or the Conference would never agree, for they are afraid and not without reason that in those circumstances a determined attempt would he made to secure a breakdown at the Conference at which revision was considered,,    The workers would get support for their attitude from two sources, from those who genuinely agreed with them in thinking that the maintenance of the Washington Convention with all its imperfections was at least of mere value to them than a discredited Washington Convention with no successor, and also from those who wish to preserve the status quo on the assumption that the Washington Convention vfill never he ratified by Great Britain and consequently will never come into force in Prance or Germany;, a state of affairs which is considered to give any other Power a good excuse for not ratifying..      My view is then that if we pursue a policy of revision we shall be embarrassed in the first instance by the proposals which we shall have to formulate.    We are not likely to have more
success than our predecessors in carrying our proposal at Geneva and even if we do succeed there is no particular-reason to think that a sound and workable international instrument would result from further consideration by the International Labour Conference at the present tine. Moreover, having regard to the nature of the amendments which would be likely to be put forward by trade unions3 this policy might increase rather than decrease hostility against us if, as is probable;  such, amendments were inacceptable08.      The remaining alternative is, I believe,  the safest^ most consistent, and most straightforward course., namely to say in the first place that we are not prepared to go on with the Hours Bill of 1930.,    It Is at least open to question whether it keeps within the four corners of the Convention and even if it does the elasticity which it provides seriously lessens the value of the Convention from an International point of view.    Moreover, there is not the slightest evidence that there is any demand for it on the part of the industrial workers of this country,    We should go on to say that in our opinion the Washington Convention Itself is inadequate to the purpose for which it was designed.    Even the Labour Government dwelt with emphasis on the difficulty of adopting its provisions to British industry.    We should recall the efforts made by the Conservative Government in 1929 to secure an opportunity for constructing from the foundations of Washington a reasonable and effective Convention.    Those efforts after full consideration were rejected and Great Britain now feels that the next move must
come from some other quarter.,   Her proposals-have beenfully considered and turned down and she is not preparedto enter the arena again.    If any other Government or if either of the Industrial groups have proposals, to make for furthering International regulation of hours of workin industry they will naturally be considered here withclose attention^    hut It should be made clear to everyone concerned that it is useless to expect the present government, particularly at this stage, to embark once moreupon the thankless task -of trying to secure any substantial amount of real agreement Internationally on this topic,9. I ohould he glad to know that my colleagues agree with the line of policy indicated in the preceding paragraphs(Intdo)    H.B.
