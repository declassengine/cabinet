Preliminary Considerations. 1.   OUR terms of reference are as follows : .&apos; ). .      .v:-&apos;v.&apos;&apos; 11 i1 v&apos;&apos; The Prime Minister desires that the Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War shall consider and report to the Committee of Imperial Defence what results could be achieved by economic sanctions by the League of Nations against Japan, alternatively with or without the co-operation of the United States of America and Russia.(Note. The Prime Minister, at the suggestion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, instructs me, in communicating this Terms of Reference, to make clear that this Report is required solely for information and must not be taken in any way as indicating any particular policy.)(Signed) m. P. A. HANKEY.&quot;2. In our Third Annual Report, presented in 1926 (C.I.D. Paper No. 746-B), we included a study of the commercial aspects of a war in the Far East. Although the situation has changed in the interval to a certain extent, owing to the relinquishment of the gold standard both by Japan and this country, the material compiled on that occasion has proved of great value in considering our present terms of reference. We attach in Appendix I a copy of that material revised to date.3. Before describing in detail the various forms of economic pressure to which resort might be made under Article 16 of the Covenant, there are one or two considerations of a general character to which we desire to draw the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence.4. In the first place we ask that, in reading this Report, it may be borne in mind throughout that the various sanctions are liable to evasion. It may be that in theory their cumulative effect would be very considerable and perhaps decisive, but this is only on the assumption that they would be carried out in good faith and with efficiency and honesty in every participating country, and that there would be no large countries standing outside the sanctions altogether. As shown later in this Report, however, such a state of affairs is unlikely, and it [6649] B
is much more probable that there would be considerable evasion. The subject is discussed in greater detail in Section III of this Report.5. Another point which has to be kept in mind is that, whatever the effects of these sanctions on Japan, there would be a considerable reaction on the trade of the United Kingdom, as well as of the Dominions, India and the Colonies. Owing to the widespread nature of our trade and business connections, these reactions would fall more heavily on the nations of the British Commonwealth than on the other countries applying sanctions. This subject is discussed in Section IV of this Report.6, We have assumed throughout this Report that the sanctions would be applied, so far as the &quot;League of Nations is concerned, without a declaration of war on Japan. We do not believe, however, that it would be safe to assume that Japan would refrain from acts of war against those who were doing their utmost to bring her to term&quot;s. The consequences of hostilities directed against the British Commonwealth of Nations by Japan pass far beyond the economic sphere and are outside our terms of reference. We think it necessary, however, to draw the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to this aspect of the question at the outset of our Report.II. The Forms of Sanctions Available.7. The forms by which the sanctions might be exercised by the members of the League of Nations may be considered under the following; headings :--Imports, Exports, Shipping, I nsurance, Finance.Imports.8. The main commodities for which Japan is dependent on overseas supplies are iron ore, oil, rubber, cotton, wool, sugar, fertilisers, and coking coal.9. Ample resources of iron ore exist in Manchuria and Korea. It would not therefore be possible, by the application of economic sanctions, unaccompanied by a blockade, to deprive Japan of this material, except on the assumption that Japan had been compelled to relinquish her control of these mainland territories.10. As regards oil, Japan has for some time been aiming at building up stocks of about 3 million tons, which is stated to be sufficient for 2 years&apos; war supply. In 1930 2 million tons were reported to have been accumulated, and it is probable that there has been a considerable increase since that date. A certain amount of oil is also obtainable from Sakhalin, the supply of which could not be interrupted.11. Japan is dependent on the United States of America, India and Egypt for stocks of raw cotton, but it has been ascertained that she has taken advantage of recent fluctuations in exchange to complete the purchase and delivery from the United States of extensive stocks of this raw material, and has now more than a years&apos; stock in hand.12. There is little information available as to stocks of rubber and wool, but we think it not unlikely that these raw materials may also have been accumulated. Japan makes heavy purchases of raw wool in Australia, and the closing of the Japanese market to Australian wool shippers would have a serious effect on Australia, with serious repercussions on other wool-producing countries, e.g., South Africa, owing to the fall in world price, which would result.13. In the matter of food-stuffs, Japan is practically self-contained. Rice, and, to a lesser degree, sugar are the main imports. The 1931 rice crop in Japan was expected to fall below the normal standard, but there was a large surplus over annual requirements on the 1930 crop, which would probably cover the deficiency. If there were a deficiency it could, we believe, be met by imports from Korea, Manchuria and Formosa, which would not be subject to interruption.
14. Even on the extreme assumption of an entire cessation of imports to Japan other than those from Manchuria and Formosa, we believe that the immediate material effect on Japan would not of itself be of a decisive character or even very serious. In course of time, however, the gradual exhaustion of existing stocks of raw material ought in theory to produce a cumulative effect that would become very serious, and if it could be continued sufficiently long might in the long run prove decisive. This conclusion, however, is drawn on the assumption that the boycott can be made effective, which, as shown later, is not likely to be realised, and we are doubtful whether in practice the effect on Japanese imports would be worth the dislocation of trade and industry involved.Exports.15. Japan is probably more vulnerable to economic pressure in her export than in her import trade. Normally, over 40 per cent, of Japanese exports go to the United States of America, 20 per cent, to China, and 20 per cent, to the British Empire, mainly India. The export to China, which consists mainly of textiles, is now at a standstill owing to the boycott, and is producing appreciable economic effects. One result is that Japanese exports, especially textiles, are being sold at low prices in other Eastern markets, the closing of which would add to her difficulties.16. The principal article of export, however, is raw silk, which represents in value 30 per cent, of Japan&apos;s total exports, and is almost entirely consigned to the United States market. The trade in silk is considered to be the most vulnerable joint in the armour of Japanese commerce. The power to place an embargo on this commodity, and thereby to exert economic pressure, is therefore centred in the hands of the United States of America.17. We consider that if a complete ban could in practice be exercised by all countries on all goods of Japanese origin, the material effect would be very serious, and, in the long run, decisive. For reasons which are discussed later, however, we anticipate that there would be a considerable leakage.Shipping.i&amp;. Some additional economic pressure would be exerted on Japan by prohibiting to Japanese ships the use of the ports of States applying sanctions, and by refusing bunker facilities to Japanese ships. The case would have to be considered by the League of Nations of Japanese ships in port or engaged in a homeward voyage at the moment at which sanctions were proclaimed. These ships might be given sufficient fuel for the return voyage, unless it was desired to prevent Japan from using them for naval or military purposes or for evading sanctions.19. In addition, ships flying the flag of the nations applying sanctions would, of course, be prohibited from using Japanese ports.20. The addition which the above sanctions would make to the total economic pressure on Japan would not be very great, since, if imports from and. exports to Japan were prohibited by most countries, there would be little cargo for the Japanese ships to carry. The restriction referred to in paragraph 18 would, however, prevent them from carrying passengers and goods between the ports of countries other than their own.21. The refusal of bunker facilities would increase the difficulties of trade between Japan and countries remaining outside the sanctions. Japan, however, could evade this restriction by a transfer of shipping to the flag of countries not engaged in sanctions.22. Probably Japan would retaliate against ships of the States imposing-sanctions which happened to be in Japanese waters at the moment of their application. -23.   On the whole, however, if economic and financial sanctions were to be employed generally, it would seem difficult to exclude shipping from their scope. [6649] b 2
Insurance.24. Similarly, it would seem difficult to avoid prohibition of insurance dealings with Japan if general economic sanctions were in force. The effect, however, might be more serious to this country, in particular, than to Japan.Finance.25. In the present state of disorganisation of financial markets all over the world, a financial boycott of Japan would presumably be less effective than in more normal times. Japan, like this country, has suspended the Gold Standard. Any circumstance tending to the discredit of the Japanese currency would, no doubt, cause a further depreciation. But much of the effectiveness of a financial blockade arises from the embarrassments involved in trying to maintain a gold standard under adverse conditions.Further depreciation of the currency might become a serious matter, but if the internal financial policy of the country is managed on prudent lines, with heavy taxation and big efforts to raise genuine money for internal loans, there is no reason why depreciation should be aggravated to the point of collapse.Under normal conditions it would be a serious disadvantage to Japan to be precluded from raising loans in foreign markets, but at present there is little prospect of any country raising foreign loans.Japan is presumably a debtor to New York, London and other centres in respect of acceptances and other short-term operations. But in case of any form of boycott being declared by the creditor countries, she would no doubt be read), to resort to a moratorium, which would for the time being save individual debtors from the stigma of default.She might find difficulty in financing any new imports if existing credit facilities were completely cut off.. The Japanese have, however, shown themselves very ready to use their gold reserves whenever necessary, and they still hold a substantial amount (522 millions of yen, or  53f millions at par) which could serve as a revolving fund to pay for imports, provided their exports continued.If their exports were more effectively checked than their imports, financial embarrassment might well play a part in effecting a corresponding reduction of imports.Remarks.26. From the above summary of the means available for putting economic pressure on Japan it will be noticed that reliance has to be placed mainly on exports, and that, of. Japanese exports, no less than 40 per cent, normally goes to the United States of America. It follows that the co-operation of the United States is absolutely essential to any attempt to impose economic sanctions on Japan. The co-operation of Russia is in one respect less important, as normally she does not send large supplies to Japan, and is not an important market for Japanese exports. If, however, Russia refused to co-operate opportunities for evasion of the sanctions would be increased a matter dealt with in the next section of this Report.27. In theory, the cumulative material effect of a boycott of Japan, involving cessation of imports and exports, restriction on shipping, insurance and finance, should be very great and, in course of time, decisive; but only on the assumption that all the countries of the world were co-operating effectively and that no large-scale evasion was possible. To this assumption we must now turn. In any case the period that would expire before any acute shortage is experienced is bound to be a matter of months, during which period means of evasion on the part of non-participants could be organized.III. Evasion.28. In considering the extent to which Japan could evade the consequences of an economic boycott on the lines described above, much depends on the question of what nations refused to co-operate in the application of sanctions.
29.   The followiiig nations are not members of the League of Nations : The United States of America.Russia.Turkey.Egypt.Afghanistan.Hedjaz.Brazil.Ecuador.Costa Rica.30. The Argentine Republic, although nominally a Member, has lately not been represented at the Assembly of the League. We think it should be assumed that she would not co-operate in the application of economic sanctions to Japan, particularly if Brazil and other South and Central American countries outside the League were engaged in a profitable trans-shipment trade.31. Consequently, even assuming the co-operation of the United States of America and Soviet Russia in the application of sanctions, considerable loop-holes would exist for evasion of the restrictions. Judging from the experience of the War, a trade would soon spring up, which would be difficult to stop and would to a great extent circumvent the League&apos;s sanctions.32. For example, the existence of a number of &quot;neutral&quot; countries would greatly facilitate the growth of a trans-shipment trade. Instead of purchasing her requirements in the countries where the business is normally transacted, Japan could obtain them at second hand in. the non-co-operating countries and transport them in her own ships, and in those of the said countries, whose mercantile marines would probably be increased by transfer of Japanese shipping to their flags.33. Probably, however, she could obtain most of her requirements by an even simpler expedient. Whatever restrictions the countries imposing economic sanctions might be able to impose and make effective on their own nationals in Shanghai and other Chinese ports, they could hardly apply them on the nationals of non-co-operating States. There would be nothing to prevent the latter from purchasing commodities from British, or Chinese, or other merchants in Shanghai and re-selling them (perhaps through a second agent in order to cover the transaction) to Japanese merchants. The goods would then be re-shipped in Japanese vessels from the Chinese ports, where Japan would probably be in a position forcibly to prevent interference by the Chinese authorities. It is possible that Chinese public opinion might be strong enough to deter coolies from working the cargo on board Japanese ships. This, however, is doubtful, for it was reported by our Military Attache from Shanghai, on the eve of one of the recent battles, that Chinese coolies were employed, in addition to Japanese labour units, in bringing up ammunition, food and water. In any event, labour could be obtained from Japan.34. The reverse process would take place to some extent in the matter of Japanese exports. The all-important item of silk would, however, be comparatively easy to identify, and its prohibition into the United States ought, theoretically,&apos; to be practicable, assuming a high level of administrative efficiency and integrity in the Customs Service. Even a small advance in prices, however, would be sufficient to stimulate ingenious methods of evasion.35. If Soviet Russia was among the &quot;neutrals&quot; it is by no means improbable that she would seek to improve her precarious financial position by improvising a thriving trans-shipment trade in Vladivostok and by other methods of evasion.36. So far as shipping is concerned, an indication has already been given (in paragraph 32) of the changes of flag which would be liable to take place in order to trade at a profit outside the sanctions, with the effect of circumventing them.37. Apart from the opportunities for evasion outside the States pledged to impose sanctions, we do not believe that they would be made effective even by
Gthose States. Experience of the Arms Traffic in China, and the Opium Traffic, is not encouraging. Even in time of war, when national feeling is strongly aroused and heavy penalties are enforceable, and an elaborate machinery of so-called &quot;blockade&quot; has been created, it is extremely difficult to stifle an enemy&apos;s trade. In the case under consideration national sentiment would not be aroused in anything like the same degree. Even in this country and America there would probably be many people who disapproved of the policy altogether or were lukewarm. In many countries there would be but little interest in the question except on the part of those who desired to make a profit by evading the restrictions. The moral deterrent to their evasion would be weak; the inducement of profit, strong. At the outset the necessary administrative machinery would be non-existent and would have to be improvised. Even in our own case, with all our experience of the War and our post-War overhauling of the problem, it would be some time before the machinery became effective. In some other countries, with no experience and little inducement, it is doubtful if it would ever become effective.3S. The moment evasion began, it would grow like a snowball. It would be impossible for merchants to stand quiescent while their trade rivals were filching their trade and building up trade connections likely to remain permanent.39. In the above circumstances we have the gravest doubts as to whether, even with the co-operation of the United States of America and Soviet Russia, it would be possible for the League of Nations to render its economic sanctions effective. If Russia refused to co-operate, a further loophole for evasion would be open. If the United States of America refused to co-operate, the whole plan would be futile.IV. The Reaction of Sanctions on the British Commonwealth.40. We have already referred in paragraph 5 to the reaction which the application of economic sanctions to Japan would have on the trade of the United Kingdom as well as of the Dominions, India and the Colonies. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned there would be a complete paralysis of export and import trade, shipping, insurance and general commercial relations with Japan. As already mentioned, the closing of the Japanese market to Australian wool would be a serious blow to Australia. &quot;The question of closing Japanese trade with British India, which is Japan&apos;s third best customer, is fraught with difficulty and delicacy. Although some Indian manufacturers would perhaps in their hearts welcome the elimination of Japanese competition, a prohibition on Japanese goods would, we are advised, be represented in India as a deliberate attempt by His Majesty&apos;s Government to force British products, particularly those of Lancashire, on to an unwilling India.41. The extent to which Japan would seek by action in Chinese ports to hamper our trade with China would perhaps turn on how far it was in her interest to keep that trade going in order to facilitate her own trade through &quot; neutral &quot; channels. It seems probable, however, that a China virtually, if not nominally, in a state of war with Japan would not provide a very lucrative market.V. The Machinery of Sanctions.42. We have not thought it worth while at the present stage to report on the machinery by which sanctions would be imposed. The Committee of Imperial Defence is aware that in recent years we have devoted much attention to the measures which at the time of the War were administered by the Ministry of Blockade. It would be necessary to adapt these measures mutatis mutandis to the application of the economic sanctions decided on by the League.43. As a general observation, however, we are very doubtful as to whether the &quot; blockade &quot; machinery could function effectively except after a declaration:
of war. Nothing less than a state of war is sufficiently definite and far-reaching in its effect to enable us to deal with all the questions of contract and the like which arise the moment the normal course of trade is interrupted&apos; by Government action.  Failing a declaration of war, special legislation would be necessary.44. Simultaneously, the corresponding action by other countries accepting an engagement to apply an economic sanction would have to be concerted at the League of Nations.VI. Summary of Conclusions. 45.   Our conclusions may be summed up as follows : (a) Economic sanctions can only be applied effectively on the following-assumptions :  (i) That no large loopholes are left for evasion. Apart from the United States of America and Soviet Russia, several nations are outside the League, including Turkey, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador and, for practical purposes, the Argentine Republic. We doubt if these nations could be induced to co-operate effectively in the application of sanctions;(ii) That the co-operation of all the nations applying sanctions isloyal and effective; (iii) That the standard of administration and the morale of the people . concerned is high enough to secure the effective carrying out of the League&apos;s economic sanction.(b) We are unable to envisage a situation in which the above assumptionscould be justified.   Once evasion began it would spread rapidly.(c) If, however, it is assumed for purposes of calculation that the aboveassumptions are justified, the results of our enquiry are as follows : (i) Economic sanctions by the League of Nations against Japan,without the co-operation of the United States of America and with or without the co-operation of Russia, would have negligible material results so far as the effect on Japan is, concerned, certainly until some months have elapsed, but would have Arery serious results upon the nations (especially of the British Commonwealth) exercising the sanctions, owing to the diversion of their trade and industry to other countries.(ii) With the full co-operation of the United States of America andwithout the co-operation of Russia it is likely, on the assumptions mentioned above, that Japanese, exports could be effectively hampered. As regards Japanese imports, however, with so many States not members of the League, and.with the contiguous county Russia not co-operating with the League, the possibilities of evasion are so great that it is doubtful whether the effect on Japanese imports would be worth the dislocation of trade and industry involved.(iii) If Russia, as well as the United States of America, were co-operating whole-heartedly, the position wrould be the same as in (ii) above, but with the possibility of evasion lessened.(d) The moral effect of sanctions on Japan is a matter with which we arenot specially qualified to deal, and which we leave to the Committee of Imperial Defence to determine.(e) The nations of the British Commonwealth, including the Colonies, wouldbe the first to be affected by the application of economic sanctions whose double-edged effect would be immediate and severe.-(f) From the point of view of machinery it is difficult to envisage the employment of economic sanctions except as part of a state of war.(g) In the absence of a state of war, special legislation would be required.
(h) The application of economic sanctions might have the result of driving Japan into open war with all or some of the Powers exercising the sanctions.   The results of this are beyond our terms of reference.(Signed)(Signed)      G. Hind.(Acting Secretary).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, March 2, 1932.E. F. CROWE.R. G. HAWTREY.O. G.

Economic sanctions have been thoroughly discussed in the press, at many meetings of industrialists and financiers, one of which was attended by Minister of War, and in innumerable conversations. Result is that Japan is considered able to withstand strain, as she would have control over resources of Manchuria and of principal centres of China, the property of which she would seize and exploit.2.

Summary Annex Table showing Imports of certain Com modifies to Japan,*Page 2020 2021 21212222 22 23 2424Memorandum.IN order that the effectiveness of the administrative machinery that can be prepaied in advance for exerting economic pressure on an enemy can be tested, we were requested to compile a list of articles which would be essential to Japan in war time, a war in the Far East being taken as a test case.2.   Statistics concerning the imports into Japan during recent years of such articles have been collected and are attached as an Annex* to this memorandum. These Statistics show :  (1) The amount (volume and, in some oases, value) imported into Japanduring the years 1922, 1923 and 1924, while in certain instances thefigures for 1925 are also given;! (2) The countries from which the articles m question were imported,showing against each country the percentage of the amount imported; (3) Wherever possible the domestic production of the article so as to showto what extent Japan is dependent on imported supplies; and (4) Whether, and, if so, to what extent, Japan&apos;s requirements could be met from China, or Russia via China, although normally the articles inquestion might be imported from elsewhere.3. It has not been within our province to consider such questions as the possibility of alliances either with or against Japan. A war has been envisaged in which the issue is contended between the British Empire and the Japanese Empire.   Japan has been considered as having access to her mainland possession* Not reproduced. An up-to-date version of this Annex is available in the archives of the Committee./&apos;-f Owing to the Japanese earthquake, considerable delay has occurred in the compilation of the statistics as records were in many cases destroyed.
of Corea, and, in the earlier stages at all events, to the resources of China, and the Trans-Siberian Railway. We wish to lay stress upon the fact that United States sources of supply are adequate to meet practically all Japan&apos;s requirements in war. As command of the sea cannot be enforced in the Pacific in the opening stages, some allowance must therefore be made for the fact that unless America were also fighting against Japan vast shipments of materials could be rushed across the Pacific during the first few weeks after the opening of hostilities. Further, if the United States of America were not involved in hostilities, the attitude of her Government and people, in view of the difficulties which might be experienced in enforcing an effective blockade, might become of primary importance throughout.Foodstuffs.4. We have excluded foodstuffs from our table. We recommend that they should be stopped, but we do not consider that even a complete cessation of imports of foodstuffs would bring Japan to her knees, except in the event of a failure of the rice crop. Rice plays such an important part in the food of Japan that it would be essential, if military operations were contemplated, to ascertain what the prospects of the next crop were, and what stocks there were from the previous crop. In Formosa two crops are grown, but in Japan only one, and it is generally possible to know in August whether the crop will be good or bad. If the crop were good, it would suffice for Japan&apos;s needs, and, with fish from the neighbouring seas and home-grown vegetables, the Japanese nation could carry on.The annual consumption of rice in Japan is about 62,200,000 koku (about 310,000,000 bushels).The position apart from imports from Formosa and Corea is approximately :I 1,000kokn.i Balance from 1929    ... ... ...        5,539    *! 1930 crop     ... ... ... ...      66,88272,421Consumption ... ... ... ...      62,200Balance     ... ... ...      10,2211931 crop forecast     ... ... ...      55,028Total     ... ... ...      65,249quite apart from the imports from Formosa and Corea. .Sugar is not grown in Japan proper to any great extent. She is dependent on imports from Formosa and the Dutch East Indies. Shipments from Java could be stopped and if communications with Formosa could be cut Japan would be seriously embarrassed as regards this commodity.But although Japan imports various foodstuffs, e:g., wheat and flour, in fair quantities, they are, with the exception of rice and sugar, hot of vital importance, and their stoppage would not exert any definite pressure.5. Fertilisers are dealt with under chemicals. Should the war prove to be of any great duration, the shortage of fertilisers would toe seriously felt and imports of fertilisers should be stopped at the earliest possible stage. Sulphate of ammonia, nitrate of soda and bean cake are Japah&apos;s principal fertilisers. The first two would, of course, be stopped at once, but it is doubtful whether any steps could be taken to check bean cake, which comes from China.6. We now proceed to a detailed consideration of the sources of supply of the various commodities on the list, and of the extent to which Japan herself can produce them, taking them in order of importance The list, though not very long, covers over 50 per cent, in value of Japan&apos;s total imports.Iron Ores, Iron and Steel.7. It is probable that greater results would be achieved by the stoppage of iron and steel than in any other direction, partly because these commodities are so important in modern warfare and partly because Japan is singularly deficient in them.
Japan produces very little iron ore, and she is dependent on supplies from mines in China and in the Straits Settlements. It is doubtful whether it would be possible to stop imports of iron ore from these sources, and it is safer to assume that it would be able to come in freely. Would these supplies be sufficient for Japan&apos;s requirements? We are of the opinion that they would not suffice. Even in peace time the quantities available would be limited, while, with the enormously increased demands called for by modern methods of warfare, these mines would prove inadequate, although great efforts would undoubtedly be made to develop them.The output of iron ore in Corea. is steadily increasing. It amounted to 484,000 tons in 1927.8. The statistical tables indicate the imports of various kinds of iron and steel into Japan during the past three years. It will be seen that Japan purchases on an average about 900,000 tons of iron ore annually, and about 400,000 tons of pig-iron. Japanese statistics about the iron situation are somewhat confusing, because at times they include the production of pig-iron from imported ores, while at other times this figure is excluded. The statistics issued by the Depart-ment of Commerce and Industry, which has control of the Imperial Steel Works, give as the output in 1924 of these works a total of 501,971 metric tons (a footnote to this figure adds : &quot; These are the aggregate quantities of steel reduced from Corean ores, ores imported from abroad and imported pig-iron &quot;).The various statistical returns about the pig-iron situation are very confusing. In some cases the production of pig-iron from imported ores is included, in others it is omitted. In some cases the figures of pig-iron used for the manufacture of steel are omitted. In some cases the amount of pig-iron produced in Manchuria and Corea is included, in others it is omitted.A return which possibly includes the total production of pig-iron for 1930 supplies the following figures : Metric Tons.Japan Proper ... ... ...     1,156,215Corea        ... ... ... ...        150,541Manchuria... ... ... ...        349,4141,656,170A newspaper article, dated the 14th January, 1932, summarizes the position in respect of pig-iron in the following way : Tons.Private consumption in 1931 ... ...        500,000Production ... ........ 600,000Import of Indian pig-iron    ...    770,000 to 780,000 !9. The report issued by the Ministry of Finance, on the other hand, gives as the total production in 1924, 473,308 metric tons of pig-iron, and 529.856 metric tons of steel, while the recent report for 1925-26 from the Commercial Secretary in Tokyo gives as the total output in 1924 of the Government Steel Works and of the Mitsubishi Works in Corea an output of 698,195 metric tons of pig-iron and 906,280 metric tons of finished steel.10. In a confidential report on the steel trade in Japan prepared by Sir Edgar Jones, who was sent on a mission to that country by the Welsh Iron Plate and Sheet interests, the production of pig-iron is given as 1,683,000 tons per annum, and of steel, 2,166,000 tons, but it is thought that these figures refer to capacity, and not to actual output.With regard to steel products, the following is the position according to statistics from various sources : Production.     Imports.     Exports. Metric Tons. Metric Tons. Long Tons. Ingots and steel bars for sale ... 81,176 69,75567,804Steel products milled, exclusive of special steel products, ofsome 100,000 metric tons     ...      1.794,504        436,922 [6649] &quot; c 2
Great efforts are being made to export steel products. In the year 1931 a contract for a bridge in Bangkok went to Japan.11. Although the official figures vary, they are sufficient to indicate that the output of iron and steel in Japan, manufactured from both domestic and imported iron ore and pig-iron, is round about 1,000,000 tons per annum. In arriving at this quantity it must be remembered that, out of the imported materials which have helped towards the total, 260,000 tons of iron ore were imported from the Straits Settlements and 158,000 tons of pig-iron from India.It is doubtful whether with only China and Corea to draw upon Japan could produce more than 600,000 tons of steel per annum, and it is significant that during the recent discussions regarding the revision of the tariff, the Government Departments concerned fought against an increase in the duty on imported pig-iron.12. It will be seen from the statistics of bars, plates and sheets and other manufactured steel products that Japan imported over 1,000,000 tons of iron and steel products in 1924. If these imports were also stopped Japan would very rapidly be confronted with an acute shortage of h&apos;on and steel. The Japanese Government have for many years past realised the dangers of their position with regard to iron, and it is for this reason that they have taken so many steps to try to safeguard themselves.The figures for iron and steel manufactures are not complete, but the figure of 1,000,000 tons can be allowed to stand.13. One of the most important measures was the creation of the Govern-ment Steel Works, and to enable these works to function properly contracts were entered into with the Hanyehping Mines in China for the supply of ore and pig-iron. The Steel Works have never paid, except for a short time during the Great War, but the Japanese Government have maintained them in view of their absolute necessity in the event of hostilities. The Anshan Works of the South Manchurian Railway and the Mitsubishi Works at Keijiho, in Corea, are later developments which have received a certain amount of Government encouragement.14. More recently the Japanese Government have given a subsidy of about  20,000 for the exploitation of a process discovered by an American inventor, named Anderson, for obtaining iron from iron sand. There are large deposits of iron sand in the Hokkaido, but, although many attempts have been made in the past to utilise them, success has not been achieved up to the present, notwith-standing the glowing accounts which have from time to time appeared in the press. The sand has a very low iron content, so that the process, if it is to be successful, must of necessity be a cheap one. If satisfactory results are really obtained, one of Japan&apos;s many problems will be partly solved, and, for this reason, it is advisable that the Committee should give particular attention to this development. We are informed that the Commercial Secretary at Tokyo has been instructed to report at frequent intervals on this subject.Nothing has been heard about obtaining iron from iron sand since the year 1929.   It is probable that the invention has not been commercially successful.15. The Japanese Government are also trying to help by subsidies and remission of taxation the iron-making industry, which has been very hard hit during recent years.16. Figures relating to the manufacture of iron and steel in Japan indicate that considerable progress has been made of recent years. What has happened is that by the development of her industry Japan is purchasing raw materials and manufacturing the goods instead of buying the finished articles. The process is necessarily gradual, but the following example will illustrate the tendency which is also to be observed in the case of many other industries : Japan was formerly a large importer of galvanised sheets. In 1910 her imports amounted to 4l&apos;,000 tons. These fell off to 19,000 tons in 1914 and to 12,000 tons in&apos; 1922. (The recovery in 1924 to nearly 30,000 tons was due to special requirements caused by the earthquake.)   This was not because she was
using less galvanised sheets on the contrary, her consumption of these sheets was increasing but she had started her own galvanising industry. In order to produce galvanised sheets, however, it was necessary for her to import thin black sheets, which could not be rolled in Japan, so while the imports of galvanised sheets decreased, the imports of thin black sheets went up by leaps and bounds. Then the Japanese turned their attention to rolling thin black sheets and began to import the necessary sheet bars for the process. In 1923 the import of sheet bars was 5,000 tons, whereas for the first five months of 1926 the import of these same bars was nearly 13,000 tons. Later on, perhaps, a stage Will be reached when she can make these sheet bars, but, even so, it will be necessary for her to obtain iron ore or pig-iron in order to produce the bars. What has happened in the case of galvanised sheets has also occurred in other branches of the iron and steel industry.The imports of galvanised sheets fell to 2,031 tons in 1929 and 2,191 tons in 1930.  The import of sheet bars was 128,000 tons in 1929 and 61,000 tons in 1930, [ while the production of sheet bars in 1930 was 81,000 metric tons.   Imports are mostly from Germany, France and the US.A.17. Coking Coal. In addition to the lack of iron ore in Japan, there is also an insufficiency of good coking coal. In this connection it is useful to note that coking coal at present is obtained principally from China, the chief source of supply being the British-controlled mines owned by the Kailan Mining Administration.   It might be possible to stop these supplies in the event of war.18. Tin-plate. Japan imports very large quantities of tin-plate. The amounts in 1924 were 76,000 tons, of which 54,000 came from the United States and 22,000 from South Wales. Before the war South Wales supplied the whole of Japan&apos;s requirements, but of recent years America has obtained the larger share.The import of tin-plate into Japan was 67,000 tons, of which 47.000 tons came from the United States and 19,000 tons from the United Kingdom.The only regular producers of tin-plate in Japan are the Japanese Govern-ment Steel Works at Yawata.   The production in recent years has been : Metric Tons.1929 ... ... -        ... ... 17,8841930 ... ... ... ... 22,4301931 (January to June) ... ... 13,292There is also a big export of tin-plates to China from the United Kingdom and America, amounting to nearly 60,000 tons, or almost as much as Japan&apos;&quot;s purchases. It is possible, therefore, that if supplies were cut oft&apos; from Japan, she might be able to get some quantities indirectly from China. Both in Japan and &apos; China the principal use for tin-plates is in connection with the oil industry, but in Japan tin-plate is also required for putting up salmon, crabs and many other kinds of food-stuffs. The Army use large quantities, and the cutting off of supplies of tin-plates would have a paralysing effect on the Commissariat Department. The Japanese tin-plate industry has hardly got beyond the experimental stage, and it is doubtful whether they would be able to produce &quot;tin-plates which could be safely used for canning food-stuffs, and, although old tins might be made use of for the oil industry, it is not thought that they could he utilised for food.19. In a Secret despatch No. 72 of the 7th July, 1926, Mr. Fitzmaurice, Acting Consul-General at Batavia, referred to the proposals which had been made by Japanese interests to supply capital for the exploitation of promising iron and coal-fields in South-East Borneo.But supposing even that these fields were developed by the Japanese, it would be difficult for them to arrange for the transport of iron to Japan in the face of an active enemy who had command of the seas. The Japanese, however, probably feel that they cannot neglect any opportunity of supplying themselves with iron, and, in the event of their next war being against an enemy other than ourselves, it would be convenient for them to have another source of iron at no great distance from their shores.
Machinery.20. After iron and steel, machinery oilers greater chances of harming Japan than any other line.It is true that Japan can turn out most kinds of machinery if hard pressed. During the last war, for instance, some of her new shipbuilding yards were almost entirely equipped with Japanese-made machinery, but the quality of the machinery is not good, and unless she had the requisite raw materials she could not proceed with production.Textile Machinery.21. The most important item in the list from a British point of view, in times of peace, is textile machinery.We supply about three-quarters of the spinning machinery, but a large proportion of the weaving and finishing machinery is supplied by Germany.Spinning and weaving machines, including parts and accessories thereof, are included in the exports of Japan.   The figures for 1930 are :  Total exports : 5,132 tons; value  385.200. Of which to China : 85 per cent.; British India : 11 per cent.; Kwantung Province : 4 per cent.;and smaller quantities to various countries, including the United Kingdom. The exports to China are largely old machinery.Metal and Woodworking Machinery, Milling Cutters, &amp;c.22. It is the item on the list which comes second to textile machinery which we should do our utmost to stop. The Japanese Customs returns record it as &quot;Metal and woodworking machinery.&quot; This and another head, &quot;Milling cutters, gear cutters, &amp;c,&quot; cover nearly all machine tools and parts imported into Japan. In 1924 the weight of these tools was nearly 5,000 tons, of which 55 per cent, came from the United States, 21 per cent, from Germany and 16 per cent, from the United Kingdom.Some special machines might be transported from Germany via. the Siberian railway, but the quantity could not be very large. There are several factories producing machine tools in Japan, and, in fact, it is the policjr of the Japanese Government, wherever possible, to stipulate that Japanese-made tools should be purchased. But the best tools of the latest design are all imported, and the Government arsenals, dockyards and aircraft and aero-engine factories would probably be seriously embarrassed if all machine tools were cut off.Electric Machinery.23. The Japanese have made greater progress in the manufacture of electric machinery than in other branches. This is no doubt due to the fact that one of their leading firms has for a long time been closely associated with the General Electric Co. of America, and many of their workmen and engineers have been trained in American shops, and there has been an interchange of plans and ideas:24. The tables annexed to this memorandum indicate the principal kinds of machinery which are imported. All of these should be stopped. - Alternative supplies could not be obtained from China, and it is unlikely that any large quantities could be carried over the Siberian Railway.Chemicals.25. During the last few years the Japanese have made an appreciable effort to extend their chemical industry, particularly in the manufacture of dyes and the fixation of nitrogen, i.e., production of ammonia and nitric acid from the air. There is ho doubt that the Japanese chemical industry was really established during the war, when Japan was unable to obtain chemicals from foreign sources.
The production of soda ash in Japan during 1931 has been estimated at 93,000 long tons, or about 63 per cent, more than the 1930 output of 57,000 tons divided equally between the Asahi Glass Company and the Japan Soda Company. The annual demand for soda ash is estimated at 120,000 tons, necessitating imports of about 27,000 tons.It is anticipated that owing to local production imports of sulphate of ammonia into Japan will not be required after June 1935. An estimate in 1928 gave the production as 280,000 tons and the consumption as 430,000 tons. This calculation, however, ignores abnormal demand created by military uses.A statistical return issued by the Japanese Department of Commerce and Industry for 1924 shows that the chemical industry (including paper making and rubber manufacture) has a capital of  69,000,000, with 2,585 factories and 130,000 employees. .A table of factories on the 31st December, 1928, prepared by the Japanese Department of Commerce and Industries gives the number of factories in the chemical industry as 2,749.   The list includes the following industries :  Drugs, medicines and chemicals. Dyestuff paints and pigments. Soaps and toilet articles. Matches and explosives. Oils and fats.Rubber and celluloid manufactures. Artificial silk. Paper mills. Artificial manures. Miscellaneous.Another return for the same date gives the number of companies as 3.131, with a capital of  166,000,000.26. The tables in the annex give the imports of the most important chemicals into Japan during recent years, and at the same time indicate the weaknesses of her chemical industry. It will be noted that during 1924 she imported the following materials. Explosives ... ... ... 145,000Glycerine... ... ... ... 176,000Caustic Soda        ... ... ... 247,000Soda Ash... ... ... ... 561,000It must, therefore, be assumed that, although the industry has been established, it is not yet in a position to meet Japan&apos;s requirements in time of peace, and is, therefore, inadequate for war.During 1930 she imported the following materials :   Dynamite  ... ... ... ... 80,200Glvcerine   ... ;.. ... ... 79.300Caustic Soda ... ....... 62,652Soda Ash (including natural soda)      ...        108,676It is.to be noted that, in 1930, 1,092 tons of explosives were exported from; -Japan.   Of this amount, 912 tons went to China. jA cid Production.27. Sulphuric Acid. This is a flourishing industry, and it produced 459,000 tons of sulphuric acid in 1924, compared with 100,000 tons in 1914. It is not clear from the statistics whether this acid is of 100 per cent, or of 70 per cent, strength; the former is required for explosives and the latter is used chiefly for , fertilisers. Japan has very large deposits of sulphur, and, provided that part of the equipment for sulphuric acid manufacture includes plant for the production of oleum (100 to 120 per cent, sulphuric acid), it appears that Japan -could meet her war requirements for sulphuric acid.28. Nitric Acid. The production of this acid has increased from 446 tons in 1914 to 3,122 tons in 1924.   This increase in production, taken in conjunction
with the output of sulphuric acid, serves as a guide to the general expansion of Japan&apos;s chemical industry. Practically the whole of the 1924 production was from sulphuric acid and sodium nitrate, but since that date plants have been erected in Japan for the production of ammonia and nitric acid from the air, and it is thought probable that, in the near future, Japan will be more independent of Chile for nitric acid manufacture. The importation of sodium nitrate amounted to 40,000 tons in 1924. most of which would be used as a fertiliser.Fertilisers (Chemical).29.   Japan produced in 1924 -107,000 tons of ammonium sulphate, and 115,000 tons of nitrate of lime.Total : 222,000 tons.During the same year she imported, in addition to the sodium nitrate, 165.741 tons of ammonium sulphate.In view of the erection of plants for the synthetic production of ammonia and nitric acid, together with existing factories for the production of sulphuric acid, it may be assumed that the importation of chemical fertilisers will decrease annually as new plants are erected.Explosives.30. The principal raw materials (other than nitric and sulphuric acid) foi the manufacture of explosives are as follows : Alcohol and Ether. Alcohol and ether are used as solvents in the manufac-ture of cordite R.D.B. and nitre-cellulose powders. Ether is obtained from alcohol by a method of de-hydration. In 1924 Japan producedv/,600 tons of alcohol, and Formosa produced approximately 60,000 tons of alcohol, so that Japan has available adequate solvents for the manufacture of cordite R.D.B. and nitro-cellulose powders.31. Acetone. This material is used as a solvent for cordite M.D. The production of acetone in 1924- from wood distillation factories amounted to 350 tons. The production did reach 600 tons in 1921; even so, the amounts are so small that Japan would be short of acetone for cordite manufacture in time of war. It seems probable that she would either produce cordite R.D.B. or solventless cordite.32.   Glycerine. Glycerine is used for the manufacture of nitro-glycerine.Tons.Output in 1924         ...          ... ... 1,285Imports in 1924       ...          ... ... 2,363Apparent peace requirements ... ... 3,648Production in 1927 was         ... ... 2,564Import in 1930         ...          ... ... 1,700The fie- ure for imported glycerine may refer to refined glycerine suitable for the manufacture of dynamite or nitro-glycerine, but it is doubtful if the figure of 1,285 tons for home production is all refined glycerine. Assuming that it is. refined, it would be equivalent to approximately 7,000 tons of cordite R.D.B. Glycerine is obtained as a bye-product in the manufacture of soap and candles, and the governing factors in its production are as follows :  (a) Supply of oils and fats.(b) Plant for the manufacture of soap or candles.(c) Plant for the purification of crude glycerine obtained from (b).(a) Japan has a very considerable industry for the production of vegetable oils, employing over 25,000 people and producing, in 1924, 19,000,000 gallons of vegetable oils. There can be little doubt that these factories hold stocks of various, oil seeds.   In addition, there is the fish oil industry, which could be utilised in
cases of emergency, so that, in the very early stages of war, Japan could probably meet the demand&apos;for oils and fats required in the manufacture of glycerine(b) Excluding one large factory, which was sold by Messrs. Lever Brothers to a Japanese firm, the soap and candle industry appears to be made up of many small establishments. Japanese statistics for 1924 give the approximate value for the products of this industry as follows : Candles    ... ... ... 950,000Soap        ............      H0-?&apos;r\00Other products       ... ... &apos;JlfTotal       ... ... ...      3,770,000If the figure of 1,285 tons represents the total recovery of glycerine from the soap and candle industry, it would appear that the existing plants are not equipped for the recovery of glycerine. It is interesting to note that in 1924 Japan imported 15,760 tons of beef tallow, presumably for the manufacture of soap or candles.(c) Japan may be in a position to supply the raw materials for glycerine, but it appears that she will be severely handicapped by the lack of plant for the purification of crude glycerine to glycerine suitable for the manufacture of nitro-glycerine. Further, she will not be able to obtain supplies from China, as this country has relatively no glycerine industry.33. Cellulose. Japan imports large quantities of cotton for textile work, and will presumably carry large stocks which could be drawn on in time of emergency. In addition, she has an important wood-pulp industry, and could use wood pulp for the manufacture of nitro-cellulose.34. Mineral Jelly. This material is used as a gelatiniser or stabiliser in cordite. The amount consumed is relatively small, and it is just possible that Japan may be able to obtain this product from her mineral oils.35. Benzol and Toluol. Benzol and Toluol are obtained from gas works and coke-oven tar, and by stripping the gases (generated in the retorts or ovens) of these products. A few kinds of crude petroleum (notably that of Borneo) contain appreciable quantities of benzol and toluol, and, in so far as Japan happened to have on the outbreak of war any suitable crude oil in stock, she would be able to extract therefrom a certain amount of these products. Given the erection of suitable factories, she would be able to produce certain quantities of T.N.T. The benzol could be used for aviation spirit, converted chemically into phenol, or nitrated with the formation of di-nitro-benzine, which, when mixed with oxidising substances, forms an explosive.36. Phenol (Carbolic Acid). This material is also obtained from tar produced in gas works and coke ovens. It is used for the manufacture of picric acid, di-nitro-phenol (for Shellite), and is a strong disinfectant. Phenol may be produced from Benzol, given suitable plant.Production of Explosives.37. In view of the importation of explosives, it appears that Japan&apos;s explosive industry could not deal with any great output of cordite, T.N.T. or picric acid.Other Chemicals.38. Chlorine. Chlorine is of paramount interest in chemical warfare. In 1924 Japan produced 11,300 tons of chlorine in the form of bleaching powder, but before this could be readily utilised for the production of toxic gases it would be necessary for her to instal plants for the liquefaction of chlorine.39. Arsenic. Arsenic may be used for the preparation of toxic gases. It is also an insecticide. Japan has a large output of arsenic which is found in the form of arsenious oxide in Kyushu, and in 1924 the Japanese statistics show a production of 3,540 tons of arsenious oxide.40. Dope. Japan has fifteen factories producing artificial silk, and, taking this in conjunction with her output of acetic acid and acetone from wood
distillation factories, it is possible that she could supply her war requirements for dope by extending her artificial silk industry.Summary.41. Japan has developed her chemical industry chiefly as regards fertilisers, soap and candles. She appears to have practically no fine chemical industry, and only a small dye industry, so that in time of war she would be lacking in actual plant for the manufacture of essential explosives and chemicals. Two small State factories exist for the production of propellants and high explosives, &amp;c, one at Iwahana and the other at Hiratsuka. There are also small trade plants for explosive manufacture, but the fact that Japan imports large quantities of explosives in peace time indicates that these factories are of minor importance.The Military Authorities undoubtedly hold secret stocks of chemicals which are not disclosed in the ordinary returns, but, even allowing for these stocks, it would be necessary for Japan to equip factories before she could produce adequate quantities of explosives and chemicals for war-time requirements. Having regard to the present small size of her chemical industry, it is probable that in the opening stages of hostilities she would be seriously hampered in the production of sufficient quantities of such chemicals by the lack of plant and properly trained men.In view of the above, we recommend that all chemicals should be stopped from entering Japan, and particularly 42. (a) Home. The chief oil-producing districts of Japan are situated in the provinces of Echigo and Akita in the main Island Honshu. Oil is also found in small quantities in the Hokkaido the northern island of Japan. There is also oil in Formosa, where the production has lately shown an appreciable increase.The output from the Japanese fields is steadily diminishing, having fallen from 407,900 tons in 1915 to 251,000 tons in 1924, in spite of efforts to introduce better methods of production. The Formosa output has increased from 100 tons in 1904 to 3,300 tons in 1925. During the first few months of 1926 the output is variously reported as being from 6,500 tons to 10,000 tons. This large increase is due to the bringing in, at the close of 1925, of one or two larger wells. Further developments in this field will be of great interest.The total output from home sources is insufficient for the demand, and recourse is had to petroleum imported from the Dutch East Indies and the United States of America. The Japanese have hitherto been active in endeavouring to obtain concessions or control of supplies in foreign countries.(b) Russian Sakhalin (leased from Soviet Government). The present annual production is about 20,000 tons. Development of this field is actively proceeding, and it is hoped to reach 50,000 tons during the next few years.(c) Imports from Foreign Countries. Unfortunately, Japanese statistics of imports of crude oil often include imports of fuel oil, and it is, therefore, difficult to draw conclusions from the following Japanese recorded figures, which show a rapid increase in imports of &quot;crude oil &quot; : (i) Glycerine, oils and fats; (ii) Nitrates of all kinds;(iii) Chlorine and chlorides; and(iv) Caustic soda and soda ash.Oil.Sources of Supply.1922 1923 1924 1925Tons. 78,900 157,270 259,900 343,837According to the Japanese figures, about 85,000 tons of kerosene and 60,700 tons of motor spirit were imported in 1924. Figures for lubricating oil and fuel oil appear not to be available.
Oil Fuel for Naval Purposes.44. Home Supplies. As stated above, the principal local oil-fields are those in the Echigo and Akita districts. The first-named district produces about 40 per cent, of the total Japanese production, but only quite a small proportion of this crude oil appears capable of yielding fuel oil. In the Akita district the crude generally is of a heavy asphaltic type, and although some gas oil and lubricants are obtained from it, there is about 75 per cent, of fuel oil. In 1922&apos; the total production of the above heavy crude oils amounted to about 200,000 tons,, of which considerably less than half could be regarded as fuel oil.It will be seen from the above that the Japanese navy is almost entirely dependent for its oil fuel on supplies derived from foreign countries. The policy of the Japanese Navy Department is, therefore, to create a large reserve of fuel oil for use in war in addition to providing for normal consumption in peace. They are increasing storage capacity as quickly as possible. It is understood that their present programme is to work up to a reserve of 3,000,000 tons, which is stated to be the equivalent of a two years&apos; war supply.A certain quantity of crude is imported and refined at the naval fuel depot at Tokuyama. This depot consists of various departments for purchasing,, refining, storing, &amp;c, and deals not only with fuel oil, but with coal. Experi-ments are also being conducted in connection with providing substitutes for natural oil, e.g., the liquifying of coal, &amp;c, but up to the present no results of commercial value appear to have been obtained.45. Imports. The contracts entered into by the Japanese Navy Depart-ment for supplies of fuel oil from foreign sources were as follows :  Amount purchased. Tons.70,000 approx.150,000 to 160,000 420,000 500,000375,000 approx.*450,000 (including *)ry of 73,000 tons was postponed till early 1924-25.Fiscal Year.1919-20 1920-21 1921-22 1922-23 1923-24 -1924-25* A further delivetIt is believed that the quantities of fuel oil imported by the Japanese Navy from the Dutch East Indies in 1924 and 1925 were as follows :  *1924 1925Tons.140,000 191,000It must be borne in mind that these figures relate to crude oil from Tarakan.. which is a natural fuel oil and conforms to the British Admiralty specification without refining. It is no doubt this oil which is taken in naval tankers to Tokuyama and reckoned as crude oil, but although it is crude oil it needs no* refining nor could any toluol be obtained from it.46. Storage Capacity. The storage capacity of the principal naval ports, on the 1st May, 1926, was as follows : Storage spare available.PlaceYokosukaKureSaseboBako (Pescadores) Tokuyama Ominato Chinkai (Korea) Maizuru ...Tons.129,500 537,000 277,00027,000 333,00080,000 9,000 143,00043. Refineries. There are a number of refineries situated on the Japanese oil-fields, and there are also commercial refineries dealing with imported oil at Tsurumi, Itosaki, Saitozaki and Tokuyama (this is additional to the naval refinery at the same place). These commercial refineries are being brought up to date and fitted with cracking plants of the latest type, and therefore larger yields of light products, and consequently smaller yields of fuel oil, will be obtained.

The normal annual consumption of oil fuel by the Japanese Navy in peace time is believed to be about 300,000 tons, and in 1920 the Controller of the Japanese Navy stated that the war consumption was calculated at about five times the peace consumption.-Oil for General Purposes.48.

The consumption of kerosene -as an illuminant has been decreasing owing to the enormous development which has taken place in electric lighting, but the consumption of petrol for motor cars has grown and will continue to increase as motor traction develops, while the Japanese Fishing Fleet, consisting of some 10,000 fishing boats uses large quantities of Diesel oil and kerosene, the annual consumption being about 233,000 tons.Fuel Oil. There is a demand for fuel oil for bunker purposes, which is increasing with the building of modern oil-fired steamships and motor vessels.49. Shale Oil. One of the developments which might be watched is the production of oil from the shale deposits owned by the South Manchurian Railway Company at Fushun, but an industry on a large scale will take some j-ears to develop and must necessarily be expensive. At present this matter is still in the experimental stage.The following figures give the output for the ten months ended the 31st March, 1931, at the Fushun Oil Shale Plant since it opened in May 1930with eighty dry distillation retorts : grude oil      ............ 57^00Heavy oil             .......... 28,600Sulphate of ammonia ...         ...         ... 13 sqoCrude paraffin.......         [][ in^OOCoke                                    ...... 2,700Non-Ferrous Metals.Copper, Antimony, Tungsten and Manganese.50. Japan is a large producer of copper. Some of her mines are not at present working to full capacity owing to the high costs of production, which make it more profitable to import American copper, but Japan could in time of war increase her output to fill ail her requirements. As regards non-ferrous metals other than copper, she has few mines of any consequence. Antimony, tungsten and manganese are produced in small quantities, while supplies of antimony could be obtained from China. For these reasons the above-mentioned metals have been left out of our returns.Aluminium.51. Aluminium was imported in 1924 to the extent of 4,088 tons. The annual average is round about this figure. Of this amount, 40 per cent, comes from the United States, 21 per cent, from Norway, 18 per cent, from France, 9 per cent, from Italy and only 7 per cent, from Great Britain.   Japan producesImperial gallons.
no aluminium herself, and is therefore entirely dependent on foreign supplies. She has a small aluminium industry for the manufacture of aluminium goods for domestic consumption and for export to foreign countries. The value of the aluminium ware produced in Japan is stated in the Government statistics to amount to over  800,000, and some 2,500 hands are employed in its manufacture.Deposits of bauxite said to amount to many million tons were discovered in 1930 in South Heian Province in Chosen.Lead.52. Imports of lead have averaged 43,000 tons during the years 1922-23-24. This lead comes almost entirely from British sources : 35* per cent, from Australia, 26 per cent, from Canada and 23 per cent, from British India, with a small balance imported from the United States. It is improbable that Japan would obtain supplies from China.Mercury.53. Of 250 tons which were imported, 65 per cent, came from Italy and 23 per cent, from Great Britain.A ickely54. Nearly 900 tons of nickel were imported in 1924. Of this over 50 per cent, came from Great Britain, and most of the balance from the United States.Tin.55. Imports of tin in 1924 were nearly 3,500 tons. Over 50 per cent, of this quantity came from the Straits Settlements and 24 per cent, from the Dutch East Indies. Nearly 600 tons were imported from China, and it is possible that this quantity could be increased in time of need. It has been pointed out, under the head of &quot;Iron and Steel,&apos;&quot; that Japan is a very large consumer of tin-plates. These are required for her oil industry and also for putting up tinned provisions. $Japan has one or two small plants for manufacturing tin-plate, but they are still in the experimental stage.Zinc Ingots.56. Zinc ingots were imported annually to the amount of over 30,000 tons during the three years 1922 to 1924. In this case, also, the bulk of supplies came from the British Empire, Australia and Canada being the two chief suppliers. There is a small quantity imported from the United States. In addition to zinc ingots, there is an import of sheet zinc to the extent of some 2,500 tons, most of this coming from Belgium and Germany. This is used largely in the match industry.Summary.57. It will be seen from the above that in regard to lead, tin and zinc, Japan is at present practically dependent on supplies from the British Empire, while she must also secure aluminium, nickel and mercury from overseas sources. All these metals should be stopped from entering Japan.Motor Vehicles.58. The import of motor cars in 1924 amounted to 4,063, of which 3,318 were from the United States. This figure, however, was swollen by post-earthquake requirements and the imports in 1925 were only 1,762. It is difficult, however, to estimate the number of cars imported, as so many come in as &quot; parts &quot; and are assembled in Japan. Details as to the weight of the parts are not given, but in 1924 the value of the complete cars imported was  833,000, while the value of the parts was  1,179,000. In 1925 the value of the cars fell to  450,000, while similarly the value of parts fell to  600,000.The total number of licensed motor cars and trucks on the 31st August, 1931, was 98,450
Since the establishment of the assembly plant of General Motors, Japan (Limited), at Osaka in April 1927, 21,125 cars had been sold in the first twenty months. The works in June 1929 were turning out 150 cars a day and 1,000 truck bodies a month.T^EffgEHiMHib^ .....i 11&quot;J ui w ittH-khe-ptresfj11 L-i n ic &quot;kT^bant--8f)^rrtWr?There are only two firms in Japan manufacturing cars to any extent. The principal one is the Ishikawajima, which turns out passenger cars and lorries under licence from Wolseley&apos;s, and the other builds small cars with a 7-h.p. engine. The Ford Motor Co. of Japan is a subsidiary concern which assembles parts.Roads are bad in Japan, and although the military authorities are prepared to give subsidies to cars which comply with their requirements, we understand that no measures have been taken to mechanicalise, even in part, the Japanese Field Forces.British supplies of cars are small, and it would be necessary to stop supplies from America.On the other hand, British motor cycles and cycles enjoy the bulk of the trade in those articles.There is a large manufacture of cycles in Japan, where they are very extensively used. Certain parts, such as chains and 3-speed gears are imported, but, except for these, a complete Japanese cycle of satisfactory quality can be produced.The subject of tyres will be dealt with under the heading of &quot; Rubber.&quot;Rubber.59. The Japanese rubber industry is now one of considerable importance. In 1924 the total value of rubber articles produced was- about  5,000,000. Of this quantity, about 25 per cent, consisted of tyres, 25 per cent, of baots and shoes, while there is a big business done in rubber toys and other smaller articles.Imports of rubber, which in 1924 totalled nearly 20,000 tons, are obtained -almost entirely from the Straits Settlements and the Dutch East Indies. A few plantations in the Straits Settlements are owned by Japanese, and experiments have been carried out by them in connection with rubber-growing in Borneo and Formosa, but neither has proved successful.In time of war the Japanese wrould have the greatest difficulty in obtaining supplies of rubber. It must be remembered, however, that motor transport in Japan has not as yet been developed to any great extent. It is unlikely that many cars and trucks could be rushed in, and the quantities of rubber required for tyres would therefore not reach very large dimensions.There is, at the present time, an export trade amounting to about 1,500 tons in rubber tyres, valued at  300,000. In time of war these exports would cease, and the rubber which is kept in stock for the requirements of the export trade would be available for domestic consumption.Although the stoppage of rubber imports would not have an immediate effect, it is important that supplies should be checked at once.Textiles.-Cotton.60. Next to silk, cotton is Japan&apos;s,most important industry, but wdiile the raw silk is produced in Japan and largely exported to the United States and other countries for manufacture there, raw cotton is not produced in Japan, and must all be imported.. It is spun and manufactured in Japan partly for domestic consumption and partly for export.The imports of ginned cotton in 1924 amounted to 476,700 tons, valued at  57,394,000, while the exports of cotton yarns and piece-goods in the same year amounted to about  40,000,000.It will be seen, therefore, that the industry is of first-class importance and .that everything possible should be done to stop imports of raw cotton. At present Japan draws her supplies of cotton from India, the United States and China in proportions of 56, 29 and 12 per cent, respectively, shipments from Egypt being comparatively small.  Japanese machinery can be adapted to use either Indian or
American cotton orc a mixture of the two, and she buys whichever is proportionately the cheaper.The stoppage of imports of cotton would have serious effects on Japan&apos;s financial position, as she would be unable to ship cotton yarns and piece-goods to China and other markets.61. On the other hand, apart from the financial aspect, a stoppage of raw cotton imports would not immediately affect the military situation, because if exports were checked the stocks of raw cotton in the country would be sufficient for domestic requirements for some considerable time. Japanese mills generally carry large stocks of cotton. It must be remembered that, in proportion to her spindleage, Japan uses far more cotton than the United Kingdom. This is partly because she spins coarser counts, but also because on account of her longer working hours more cotton is required. This can be seen from a comparison of statistics made by the International Cotton Spinning Federation.In 1925 Great Britain, with 57,116,000 spindles, consumed 3,235,000 bales. The United States, with 37,937,000 spindles, consumed 6,127,000 bales, while Japan, with only 5,292,000 spindles, consumed 2,459,000 bales.It is probable, therefore, that her stocks would suffice; but a problem which would come up for immediate consideration in the event of China remaining neutral would be the attitude which should be adopted vis-a-vis China in regard to cotton.62. China imports large quantities of raw&apos; cotton from India, and, as above stated, she purchases cotton yarns and cotton piece-goods to a very considerable value from Japan. Many of the cotton mills in China are owned and managed by Japanese.If war broke out and exports from Japan to China were stopped, a neutral China would naturally look elsewhere for her supplies. She would expect to be allowed to import increased quantities of raw7 cotton from India in order that her mills might make up for the deficiency caused by the falling off in Japanese -supplies.But it would clearly not be to our advantage that supplies of Indian cotton should reach Japanese mills in China, and it would be necessary, therefore, to devise means whereby, as far as possible, British and Chinese mills would be allowed supplies while the Japanese mills would be starved.Woollens.63. The position with regard to wool is slightly different from that of cotton. In the case of cotton, there is a very large export trade done in cotton yarns and textiles to China, India and other markets, whereas in the case of wool the con-sumption is almost entirely domestic, as there is practically no export of woollen goods.The increased use of woollen garments has been one of the striking features of life in Japan during the last 20 years, and nowadays every Japanese man, woman or child wears wool in some form or another; but it is a modern tendency, a movement in the direction of more luxurious living, and, if necessary, the people could fall back on cotton and silk kimonos, while there would be ample wool in the country for the purpose of making uniforms and other military requirements.Although, therefore, it would be desirable to stop all imports of wool, it is not a measure which would seriously hamper the Japanese in the prosecution of a war in a tropical or sub-tropical climate.64. The tables in the annex give the imports of wool, yarns and piece goods in recent years.Wool was imported in 1924 to the extent of 26,359 tons, of which 92 per cent, came from Australia; wool tops amounted to 4,777 tons, of which 69 per cent, were from the United Kingdom and the balance from Australia. Thirty-five million square yards of woollen piece goods were imported, of which 97 per cent, came from the United Kingdom, so that it will be seen that practically all the business in wool tops and piece goods is British. It is only in the case of yarns that there is any competition. Out of 9,200 tons of worsted yarns imported in 1924, 39 per cent, came from the United Kingdom, 38 per cent, from Germany and 19 per cent, from France.
In the past Japan has also bought occasionally from the Argentine and South Africa, but in the case of war she would be cut off from these sources of supply, and only China would remain open. The quantities obtainable from China are small, and the quality is more suitable for carpet making than for ordinary wearing apparel.65. The other textile materials are not of any great importance in connection with the questions raised in this memorandum.Flax.Flax is grown in fair quantities in the Hokkaido, while ramie and China grass are also grown in Japan and could be obtained from China.77 emp.Hemp is imported from the Philippine Islands, but while some of it is for rope manufacture the larger proportion is for the making of hemp braids for hats.Jute.There is an import of jute for the local manufacture of gunny bags, but gunny bags were imported to the extent of 2,152 tons in 1924.Nearly all of these came originally from India, though some were supplied via China.If the import of gunny bags were stopped Japan might be able to fill her requirements with bags made of rice straw. These are already used to a large extent in Japan, but they are not so satisfactory and do not stand such rough wear as gunnies.Summary.66. (i) It will be seen that, subject to the considerations set forth in para-graph 3, which for convenience of reference are repeated in (ii) and (iii) below, the maximum effect upon Japan can be ensured by stopping the following&apos; essentials* from reaching her shores :  nOres and metals particularly iron, steel, tin, lead, zinc, aluminium,nickel and mercury, Machinery, including special tools and instruments, Chemicals particularly (a) Glycerine, oils and fats,(b) Nitrates of all kinds,(c) Chlorine and chlorides, and(d) Caustic soda and soda ash,Oil,Rubber, Cotton,and we recommend that the machinery of blockade should be so applied as to concentrate on these particular items.(ii) As command of the sea cannot be enforced in the Pacific in the opening stages, some allowance must be made for the fact that unless America is also fighting against Japan, vast shipments of materials could be rushed across the Pacific during the first few weeks after the opening of hostilities.(iii) If the United States of America were not involved in hostilities, the attitude of her Government and people, in view of the difficulties which might be experienced in enforcing an effective blockade, might become of primary importance throughout.The impression after going through the figures in this report is that while Japan is far from self-supporting, the stocks of pig iron and the supplies which can be obtained from Manchuria and Corea would enable her to maintain her iron industries for at least a year in spite of a blockade. A blockade must con-concentrate on the raw materials and would be effective, but great difficulty must be experienced unless most of the countries in the world are willing to cut off supplies.* We have assumed throughout that special attention would automatically be directed to the stoppage of munitions of all kinds.
(iv) The effect of restricting exports from Japan has not been exhaustively considered above, but the following commodities repay examination&apos;: Silk.Of raw silk to the value of  41,691,000 exported from Japan in 1930, quantities valued at  39,871,000 were exported to the United States. The value of the silk exported was 29 per cent, of the total exports from Japjwi. Judging from the figures of export for the first ten months of each of the years 1930 and 1931, the quantity exported in 1931 will have exceeded that of 1930, but the value will be less.   The figures are : Tons.January to October, 1930   ... ...      21,668January to October, 1931   ... ...      26,548The boycotting of this trade by the United States would be an extremely serious matter for Japan.The trade in silk piece goods with the United States is not such a large question. The total value of silk piece goods exported from Japan in 1930 was  6,576,000, of which the United States took about 10 per cent.Cotton Goods.The total export of cotton tissues from Japan in 1930 was valued at  27,211,678. It is noticeable that practically all countries in the world are included in the countries of destination. A general boycott of Japanese cotton goods would probably be serious for the Japanese, but on the other hand such -action would reproduce serious repercussions in those countries from which Japan imports raw cotton, which are British India.
