THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1932.Copy No.     9CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS.STOPPING in Paris for M. BriancTs funeral on my way from Geneva to London, I was able to have a long conversation with M. Tardieu on a range of subjects which at present affect our two countries. The interview lasted for nearly two hours. M. Tardieu expressed his satisfaction with the resolution which had been unanimously passed by the special Assembly of the League yesterday on the subject of the Sino-Japanese dispute. I told him that I was also very well pleased with it; it had been warmly received by the United States representatives who were present; the Japanese representatives regarded it as reasonable notwithstanding its strong declarations; and we had healed any breach between the small States and the Great Powers on the subject, and reached a conclusion which must be regarded as a stout defence of the principles of the League. The resolution, however, was only the end of a first stage, and I hoped we should keep in close touch on the matter for the future as in the past. I told him of my co-operation with M. Paul Boncour, and added that M. Hymans, the Belgian Foreign Minister, had proved a most admirable President throughout the deliberations.Passing to the Disarmament Conference, M. Tardieu told me that it was his intention to go back to Geneva on Tuesday and to make a speech there this week, probably on Thursday, dealing with the German thesis of equality of treatment. He proposed to use very moderate language, but described the attitude he would take up as opposing the German thesis &apos;&apos; in law and in fact.&apos;&apos; By this he meant, first, that France could not contemplate any concession to the German contention about Part V of the Treaty, as he held that there was no ground for considering that Germany&apos;s admission to the League had affected its applicability, or that the interpretation of article 8 which the Germans advanced would justify the position which they now wished to take up. He considered that Count Apponyrs speech had put the contention of the defeated Powers in its boldest form; the German Chancellor and Herr Nadohry had meant the same thing, but had put it much more discreetly. On this I said that the British Government would certainly not be in favour of a breach of the treaty and indeed the special Assembly of the League had just been passing a resolution about the Far East which began with the affirmation that there must be a scrupulous regard for treaties. More-over, I agreed that the Treaty of Versailles, upon its proper construction, did not make the disarmament of others the legal condition upon which Part V depended. But we felt strongly that the introductory words of Part V, the language of article 8 and the Clemenceau letter did amount to a representation of the intention of the victorious Powers and had thus constituted an inducement to Germany to accept the conditions imposed upon her. Was it not possible, in connection with the Disarmament Conference, to meet the German objection based on inferiority of status by recasting the Draft Convention, perhaps by dropping out article 53 and substituting a scheme which would in fact keep German arma-ments down to something like their present level without basing the limits imposed on Germany on different principles from the limits which other Powers accepted? If we could meet Germany&apos;s strong and natural objection to being put irrmferior status and treated by a special regime (an objection with which many people in6294   [6719]&apos;CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 98 (32).
other countries sympathise) we might still hope to reach agreement without increasing German armaments by applying some common principle to all alike/ even though the actual figures would be widely different in different cases. M. Tardieu said that he thoroughly appreciated the meaning of my suggestion and indicated that he was open to consider it, but he insisted that no French Govern-ment would be able to contemplate the further rearming of Germany or any treat-ment of the problem which would release Germany from existing obligations in regard to her level of armaments. I said that I believed that Germany&apos;s feeling in the matter was much more a question of status than a question of figures, and this was why I thought that treatment on these lines was the most hopeful method.M. Tardieu explained that when he spoke of his intention to challenge the German thesis not only in law but &quot; in fact,&quot; he meant that there was abundant evidence that Germany had, in fact, greatly exceeded the limits of armament which Part V of the treaty imposed upon her, and he intended, speaking regretfully, to point out that this was undoubtedly so. I said that I had understood that it was not intended either on the French or the German side fully to develop their contending views at this stage, but I supposed that impending elections made it natural for both sides to desire to say something on the subject. I hoped very much that what was said would be sufficiently restrained not to lead to anything like an open breach. I should find it very difficult to return to Geneva in the next few days owing to the importance of Cabinet discussions at home, and the conference would be adjourning on to-day week till after Easter.We then passed to other subjects, and I stressed my keen desire to arrange with him without delay a settlement of the controversy over the Heads of Agreement about the limits of French naval construction. We had been working at this for two years past, and had put forward a proposal which we considered met the substance of the French case by spreading the French figure over five years and leaving France quite free as to 1936. I said that I realised that France would like a much wider arrangement involving total proportions, but this had been impossible to reach at the time of the London Naval Conference and could not be reached at once now. We felt rather dissatisfied with the French response to our proposal, which, as he knew, was made in a sincere effort to promote a better understanding in this matter between France and Italy. Would it not be possible for us to settle this point promptly and so have a practical example of the co-operation which we both hoped to promote in a wider field?M. Tardieu replied by repeating what he had said to me at Geneva, viz., that the size of the British fleet gave France no concern, but that his trouble was with Italy, and that our proposal did not really meet his apprehensions in that regard. I agreed that Italy&apos;s theoretic claim to parity would remain, but for practical purposes a definite arrangement on the lines proposed would give us all both a sense of relief and a sense of something clone, and I pressed him very strongly to give us this proof of the practical results of our efforts to co-operate as an earnest for the future. Without giving me any definite answer, and, indeed, while rather indicating that he would like to meet my wishes if he could, M. Tardieu replied that he was hoping for closer co-operation between Britain and France over a wide field of subjects, and he did not, as a negotiator, like to give way on a point to which we attached importance without getting results in other directions which were important for him. I replied that our proposal about the French building programme was put forward not because we should gain by it, and not because we were prepared to pay for it, but in the general interests of appeasement in this sphere. Was the only difficulty that Britain might reserve the right to escalate in the last year when France was free ? If this was the only point of difficulty outstanding, I should like to know, for I attached so much importance to getting this matter settled that I wanted to find out definitely where the remaining difficulty lay.M. Tardieu then took up the suggestion that our two Governments should eo-operate on a wider range of matters. Two methods were possible. One was for us to resolve to exchange views on a number of topics and try to reach agree-ment while keeping our discussions secret. Another method was to let it be known that we were considering a series of questions together, such as reparations, the controversial aspects of the disarmament problem, the topics raised in the French memorandum, naval agreement, the future economic relations between our
.two countries, and the economic recovery of Central Europs. Lord Lansdowne. .and M. Delcasse had found it possible to promote a more general entente 28 years .ago, and the model was worth bearing in mind. I took a note of these suggested topics, and, without giving any answer on the spot, said that I was returning to London, and should, of course, make a full report of our conversations to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.On one subject, however, I wanted to take the opportunity of ascertaining his views and communicating my own more definitely now. This was the subject of the economic problem of the Danubian States. &quot;I reminded him that the British Government had put forward confidential enquiries to Paris, Rome and Berlin .some weeks ago, and had indicated their own belief that a Customs Union, if it were possible, gave the best promise of good results. Since then we had learned from more than one quarter that this particular method of solution was not likely to be acceptable, but we were still convinced that no time must be lost in finding the best practicable means of improving a dangerous situation. M. Tardieu asked me in what direction my mind was moving. I said I spoke with all reserve, but I was disposed to think, subject to further consultation with my colleagues in England, that a way might be found if the four Great Powers, France, Britain, Italy and Germany, agreed to urge the five small Powers, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungaiw, Roumania and Yugoslavia, to meet without delay and consider amongst themselves what plan for closer economic relations they could work out between them, it being clearly understood that the Great Powers, in urging this course, were not committed in advance to accepting the resulting suggestion, but would have to examine it with due regard to their own interests. Germany, I thought, must be one of the inviting Powers, for it was inconceivable that a satisfactory Danubian arrangement, which must include Austria, could be brought about without Germany&apos;s approval. At this point, M. Tardieu said with considerable warmth that he was delighted to hear me express my own mind in these terms, for he had already prepared a paper, which he intended to give me, and which I should find involved a suggestion on exactly these lines. He then handed me the document annexed. After studying it, I said that I agreed that it seemed to follow very closely what I had been hinting at. I noticed, however, that in its present form it proposed to state that the invitation was put forward on the initiative of the French Government. Would M. Tardieu, in view of his desire to promote close co-operation between France and ourselves, like us to consider whether we should be prepared for the first suggestion to come from the British Government no less than from himself. Of course, the invitation to the five small Powers must be from the four Great Powers altogether, but possibly the -origination of the scheme in London and Paris would be the thing that might be stated. M. Tardieu said at once that anything which the French Government wanted to propose they would like to propose along with us, and he hoped the same thing was true of proposals which we wanted to originate. We agreed that there should in any case be no publication of his scheme till I had consulted my -colleagues and had communicated with him again. He said that he would like, if possible, for the plan to be announced publicly before the end of the coming week. He would be back in Paris on Friday, and we could keep in touch through our Ambassadors without difficulty.In the course of our discussion, M. Tardieu gave me an interesting account of the order of recent events on this subject. He reminded me of our previous discussion at Geneva on the 29th February. Immediately after seeing me he had, as he told me he would, seen Signor Grandi. Signor Grandi had expressed himself as personally favourable to the plan, but said he must consult his chief in Rome. Instead of continuing on this line, however, Italy in the early days of March formally executed the separate arrangements with Austria and Hungary which had been initialled in draft ever since July. And now we had Italy&apos;s claim that she too must be regarded as a Succession State in this connection, which M. Tardieu regarded as quite inadmissible.Before leaving the Quai d&apos;Orsay, we agreed on the terms of a communique which, for convenience, is also appended to this record.J. S.Paris, March 12, 1932.

Sir John Simon, who wished to come to Paris to-day to be present in person at M Briand&apos;s funeral, repeated to M. Andre Tardieu the expression of the deep emotion caused to the Government and people of the British Empire by the death of the eminent statesman.   M. Andre Tardieu thanked him deeply.3. The two Ministers, who had not had an opportunity of meeting since the 29th February, talked of what has happened at Geneva since then.4. They expressed satisfaction at the happy conclusion of the League of Nations&apos; labours by the unanimous voting of the final resolution, and they further reviewed the questions which the Disarmament Conference will discuss next week.5. Sir John Simon and M. Andre Tardieu then considered the various problems with which their respective Governments ai*e at present faced.6. In particular they examined the economic situation of Central and Danubian Europe.7. They found themselves in agreement that, in this, as in all other matters, co-operation between France and Great Britain should extend over a wide field, with the two-fold object of appeasing political rivalries and expediting economic-reconstruction in Em-ope.
