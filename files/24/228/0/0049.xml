[This document is the Property ol His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1932.SECRET.CP. 99 (32). Copy No.CABINET.Reports by Local Governments on the Political Situation in India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly reports from the Local Governments in India.S. H.India Offick, loth March 1932.Government of India.Delhi reports less purely Congress agitation, but Ahrar activities resulted in clashes with the police on the 11th and 12th, and there is some local excitement at present.2. Tribal unrest among the Mohmands has caused some recrudescence of the Red Shirt movement in part of Peshawar District, but the latest reports indicate a fair chance of the tribal situation clearing up.3. Otherwise there has been no marked change in the situation. Bombay.The situation generally is unchanged in the districts, but the release of leading-agitators, hitherto interned, is giving slight local impetus to the movement. There have been no incidents of importance. In Bombay city attempted demonstrations-against the Franchise Committee were easily suppressed. The markets were closed from Saturday to Monday owing to holidays, and a partial hartal on account of Franchise Committee was observed on the remaining days. A hostile demonstration took place on the opening of the Share Market on the 7th, and eight female picketers were arrested. Picketing in reduced numbers continued in the Cloth Markets and,, occasionally, at the Exchange Banks and Bullion Market. The Mint was not picketed. Action taken under Ordinance 2 was as follows : Section 3 : arrests 8, total detained, 217 ; section 4 : orders issued, 135 ; total in force, 859 ; section 21, convictions during-the week, 49. Congress funds amounting to Rs. 35,863 have been forfeited under Ordinance 4.Bengal.The situation is much as it was last week, but there has been a further improve-ment in eastern and northern Bengal. A crowd of about 2,500 made a determined attack on the Sub-Registry Office, Midnapore District, but were dispersed. The situation in this district causes some anxiety. In Calcutta the week was quiet, but students from several colleges took part in processions. Section 3, arrests 14. Section 4, orders issued 210 ; total in force 1,966, Congress funds amounting to-Rs. 3,000 were forfeited under Ordinance 4.Madras.The situation is much the same. There is little civil disobedience activity except sporadic picketing.   Campaign of misrepresentation in the Press continues.Punjab.The Province is quiet. The Ahrar programme of civil disobedience appears to-have collapsed, and the supply of Sikh volunteers has failed, but the Congress continues to endeavour to capture the Central Sikh League, while the Central Muslim Conference on the 22nd instant at Lahore will debate non-co-operation. The trade situation is unchanged. Communal tension is less apparent as result of the more reassuring reports from Kashmir. Political arrests during the week were :- Under-ordinary law 53, under Ordinances 93. Totals to date, 325 and 685 respectively. Arrests under section 3 remain at 5. Five Orders were issued under section 4, total to date 5G.   The total number of prosecutions for infraction of such orders is 10.775GO   3.32
North-West Frontier Province.Renewed Red Shirt and Congress agitation is still apparent in parts of Peshawar-District, especially the northern portion of Mardan tahsil. It lacks organisation and is likely to subside gradually after the trans-frontier situation is completely restored. Propaganda to boycott the electiou is increasing, but its effect is small and localised at present. Other districts continue very satisfactory. Section 3 : arrests, 2 ; total detained, 2. Section 4 : orders during the week 46 ; total in force, 2,024. The trans-frontier situation is still uncertain among the tribes uorth of Kabul River, and various lashkars have collected to threaten Dir territory or the British border about. Shabkadar, although no attempt has yet been made to invade British territory. A small lashkar of 2,000 of the Bajaur tribe and Utmanzai Mohinands is in Pandiali valley, 10 miles north-west of Abazai, and was yesterday bombed and machine-gunned from the air. Air action against the offending Bajaur tribe began on the Sth March, but was interrupted by two days&apos; heavy rain. Result is believed to be good, but it is too early yet to judge for certain. Much depends on the Upper Mohmands, who are at present discussing a jehad, but have not yet raised any lashkars. Provided they refrain from participation, the situation will probably be restored in a few days&apos; time.United Provinces.There is no change in the general situation. Sporadic demonstrations and arrests are reported from a number of districts. Underground effort continues. No order has been passed under section 3. Under section 4 of Emergency Powers Ordinance, 19 orders were issued ; six persons were convicted for def3ung orders under section 4. Convictions during the week were, under Ordinances 163, under ordinary law 308. Total to date, 6,942.   Releases on apology, 1,265.Bihar and Orissa.The week generally has been quiet, but there has been some picketing and attempts at hoisting the Congress flag. Distribution of leaflets continues, especially from sources in Patna, Muzaffarpur and French Balasore, indicating undergrouud activities. Five more orders under section 4 (1) Emergency Bowers Ordinance were passed, making the total in force 21. No prosecution under this section has been entered.   Section 3 is not in force.   Total prosecutions, -1,592.Central Provinces.Except for the dispersal of a small mob in Chanda, the week was without incident and Gandhi Day was a failure everywhere. The only sign of Congress activity was increased distribution of bulletins in Nagpur and Jubbulpore. Prosecutions, 87; convictions, 114.   There has been no extension of Ordinances.Assam.There has been active picketing in a few areas, and prosecutions have therefore increased. Prominent leaders of the civil disobedience movement in Sylhet have been convicted, and generally the situation is improving.Burma.There Is nothing of importance to report this week. No Government casualties are reported ; 40 under-trials were released and 562 now remain iu custody. The price of paddy continued steady during the week between 115 ami 120. The collection of taxes continues to make satisfactory progress. Owing to the move to Mayiuyo, no telegram will be sent next week.Ajmer Merwara.There have been eight arrests under ordinary law. Some attempts were made in Bcawar to stir up agitation among the mill operatives, and there is considerable unrest in the Istimrari Estates, which appears to be organised by persons keeping in the background.From the Resident, Mysore.In Coorg the situation is unchanged. In Bangalore there has been only one arrest and one conviction during the week.   The situation is very quiet. i
