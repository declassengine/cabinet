Iny ^5 U)[This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesties Government.]Printed jor the Cabinet.   February 1932.SECRET.CP. 83 (32). Copy No......9..CABINET.Reports by Local Governments on the Political Situation in India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly reports from the Local Governments in India.S. H.India Office, 23rd February 1932.Government of India.The Delhi report indicates little change. This week&apos;s reports, on the whole, confirm last week&apos;s appreciation, and are particularly satisfactory as regards the North-West Frontier, the United Provinces, the Punjab, and Madras.The danger of sporadic cases of violence as the result of Congress demonstrations is illustrated by an incident in the Monghyr district of Bihar and Orissa, where a very determined attack was made on a police station, which was beaten back with difficulty after resorting to firing. Instances of this kind are of casual occurrence, and there is no reason at present to attach importance to them.2. The situation in Kashmir and Jammu continues to improve, but accounts of recent events have intensified communal feeling outside, and in the Punjab particularly it is very tense.3. In constitutional spheres, the attitude of the Burma Legislative Council towards-the statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government is important.&apos;  Bombay.No important occurrences have taken place during the week in Bombay city, or in the Mofussil districts. The situation generally remains quiet, without serious demonstrations or lawbreaking. Congress propaganda continues locally. Liquor shop auctions have been held in several districts without picketing or interference. In Bomba3&apos;- city picketing of cloth shops continued, and of Exchange Banks on three days. The Mint was picketed on two days only, and all the picketers have been arrested. Auctions of liquor shops were picketed on the 17th and 99 persons were arrested. Sales went on undisturbed and there was no excitement. Action under Ordinance 2 during the week was as follows: Arrested under section 3, 35; number of orders issued under section 4, 120. The total number of persons detained under section 3 is 395. The total number of orders in force under section 4 is 842. Arrests for breach of orders under section 4 during the week were about 41.Bengal.The situation is outwardly quiet, but under the surface it is uneasy, and there has been some deterioration in Midnapore district. A demonstration by peasants in Tippera district on the loth, which necessitated police firing, was instigated by Congress agents. Section 3, arrests 33. Section 4, orders issued, 200; total in force, 1,185.Madras.The situation remains unchanged. Intermittent picketing and a campaign of misrepresentation continues. The leaders remain in the background and engage women and children or hire unemployed youths for picketing. Otherwise there is a definite decline in civil disobedience activities in almost all districts. Resolutions and letters from associations and individuals supporting the policy of Government and offering assistance in combating the movement are being received.72(5      60   2.32
Punjab.Civil disobedience and Congress have ceased to be major issues. Arrests at Lahore include Sardul Singh Cavisher, All-India dictator, who insisted on being arrested by an open and advertised breach of an order issued under section 4. Numbers have been somewhat swollen by continued influx of Congressite Pathans, as last week, but there has been no activity in Amritsar and very little attention paid in Lahore. There is no change in the general trade situation. Communal tension is, becoming increasingly dangerous owing to exaggerated rumours, aud Press reports of barbarities in Kashmir. Arrests for political activities under the ordinary law, 37 ; under Ordinances, 86 ; totals to date being 126 and 440 respectively. No arrests under section 3. Eight orders have been issued under section 4. Total to date, 40. Total under restraint, for infraction of such orders, 8.Central Provinces.There has been no marked change in the situation. The only occurrences have heen dispersals of crowds at Wardlia and Chanda. At Wardha crowds demonstrated against a liquor shop and were dispersed with 10 casualties. At Chanda an attempt was made to celebrate. Gharwali Day ; no casualties. Berar reports fewer meetings ; situation much easier. Prosecutions, 211 ; convictions, 241. No fresh notifications under Ordinances.North-West Frontier Province.In Peshawar district the success of the police in frustrating an attempted meeting in the Charsadda area after the Id had a good effect and no further recrudescence of agitation has occurred. Owing to the improved situation, restrictions under section 144, Criminal Procedure Code, have been withdrawn in the whole of Nowsbera tahsil and in one thana of Peshawar tahsil. Other districts continue very satisfactory. In the trans-frontier area the Dir situation has somewhat improved. Pamela Khel have handed in all except two captured rifles, and have given a written undertaking to the Nawab of Dir to remain quiet and obey his orders, but have refused to return the other looted property. The Bajaur situation is still uncertain. Alingar Faqir has raised a small Salarzai lashkar, but serious action is not probable at present. Other tribes are quiet except for inter-tribal disputes between the Mahsuds and the Wazirs in the Shakai area.Arrests under section 3 during the week were 23. The total detained is J,272. Orders under section 4 during the week were 261.   Total orders in force, 1,371.&quot;United Provinces.The week has heen quiet and the situation normal in the majority of districts. Little picketing continues. Processions are taken out in cities of Allahabad and Cawnpore from time to time, and spasmodic efforts have heen made to arouse enthusiasm elsewhere. The no-rent agitation is almost dead. Rent and revenue collections continue steadily, if slowly, and even the Allahabad districts report improvements ; counter propaganda is being vigorously carried on everywhere. Underground efforts to foment trouble are being made and the number of convictions in certain districts, notably in Allahabad, is still considerable. No use has been made of section 3, but 29 orders have been issued under section 4, Emergency Powers Ordinance. 1 otal orders issued to date, 312. Convictions during the week under the Ordinances were 283 and under the ordinary law 547. The total to date is 5,303. Releases on apology, 904.Burma.The situation is generally satisfactory. Shan by , the main organiser of a recent attempted rising in the Zigon sub-division, has heen captured, and cue of his principal supporters surrendered. No casualties are reported among Government forces. Seventeen under-trials have been released and 383 are reported as still in custody, but some returns have not yet been received. The price of paddy continues to rise and is now about 100. Satisfactory progress continues to be made in the collection of taxes.
Bihar and Orissa.The Province is generally quiet. The latest development of Congress activity-consists of numerous attempts to hoist the Congress flag on Government buildings. Most of these were easily suppressed, but an attempt at Tarapur culminated in a serious attack on the District Officer and police, which was clearly organised beforehand. Details have already been given. Additional police will be posted in this and another area within district of Monghyr.   Convictions till 13th February total 3,584.Assam.There is little change to report. Sylhet, on the whole, has been quieter, though an attempt reported to start a Peasants&apos; League on lines of Tipperah. Assam Valley is still quiet, except for some attempts at picketing. Attempts to organise volunteers have been met by bringing the Unlawful Association Ordinance into force in three districts of the Assam Valley.Ajmer Merwara.There has been very little activity in Ajmer Merwara during the week. Eight persons have been arrested under section 17, Criminal Law Amendment Act. A few agitators are working behind the scenes.Goorg.There have been 81 arrests and 59 convictions to date. The situation is much improved. In Bangalore, convictions total 194 to date and there have been 17 more arrests since the last report. The situation is quiet.
