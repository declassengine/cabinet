117 HiTHIS DOCUMENT IB TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. 1 ______________ w ;-./fUNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT.?7TT3(25)aMEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR,1.     According to all the indications the debate on the Vote on Account on March 5th will be used by the Labour Party for a concerted attack&quot; on the new contribution requirement for unemployment benefit, which has been in force since 19th February (see my memoranda CP.43(25) of   30th January), and generally on the alleged &quot;tightening up&quot; of Unemployment Insurance administration. I am anxious to be sure that I have my colleagues with me In the lines of the reply which I propose to make. 2.     I propose to base my reply on the fact that a contributory Unemployment Insurance Scheme is not, and cannot be, a;ischeme for the relief of destitution.   Even as extended by the Labour Government last year, the present scheme provides no benefit for the destitute as such;   no one oan get benefit unless he is not only unemployed and seeking work, but also has been, and In normal circumstances will again be, an insured contributor. That this is bound to be so, must be clear to anyone who reflects that three quarters of the money used for benefit comes from insured persons in employment and their employers.3,     The Labour Government Act of last year, under whichwe are now working, recognises this principle fully.    Itprescribes, among the conditions for extended benefit,that the applicant must prove -(a) that he performed what was, in all the circumstances, a reasonable amount of insurable work in the past two years;
(b) that In normal times insurable employment suited to his capacities is likely to he available for him,4.     The Act goes further.   In order to limit benefit expresslyto those who have been, recently and substantially, &quot;insuredcontributors&quot;, it provides that no benefit of any kind is payableunless the applicant has paid 30 contributions or more since thebeginning of the la3t insurance year but one,5.     This last requirement was too great a change to be brought fully into force at once and the Minister of Labour was therefore given power, in the period up to 1st&apos; October, 1935, to waive compliance with it in any case in which he thought fit to do so. It was In exercise of this power that I introduced the contribution regulation referred to in the first paragraph of this memo, viz., payment of either 8 contributions since the beginning of the la3t insurance year but one or 30 contributions since first entry into insurance.    (Disabled ex-Service men, however, even if they cannot satisfy this requirement, are allowed benefit if the Local Employment Committee so recommend).     The effect of this contribution requirement so far has been to disqualify between 10 and 15 thousand persons, nearly all of them men. 6.     My colleagues should realise, however, that this is only the first step.   The Act brings fully into foroe on 1st October next the requirement that 30 contributions must have been paid since the beginning of the last insurance year but one - a requirement which, if applied now, would disqualify some 250,000 persons. It was obviously the Intention of the Act, in granting a suspensory power up to 1st October, that during the interval a
gradual approach should be made to the now requirement. The two figures I have quoted - 10,000 to 15,000 now die-qualified and 350,000 disqualified by the full requirement -shew that there is a considerable gap yet to be bridged, 7.     I am not confident that this gap can be fully bridged by 1st October - and if it cannot, legislation will be necessary this Session to continue the suspensory power, with certain modifications to suit&quot;the circumstances.     But I wish to impress upon my colleagues that we cannot rest where we are.     This contribution requirement is a vital part of last yearrs Act.     It must bo attained, albeit by instalments, as to the size and frequency of which regard will have to be paid to the state of industry and employment for the time being.     Proposals for this purpose will be submitted to the Cabinet in due course.8.     In tho Debate in the House on 5th March, I propose to give a general indication of Suture policy on thtfse lines. 9.     In making these proposals, I am not unmindful of their effect on increasing Poor Law Charges.     But in my opinion we have gone too far in the direction of throwing the bur-den of destitution on the insurance scheme.     Tho problem of the incidence of poor rates is a perplexing one, but if we go on tyring to solvo it at tho expense of tho insurance scheme we shall sooner or later find it impossible to con-tinue the system of contributory insuranoo and be driven to the disastrous expedient of transforming it into a scheme of State relief of destitution paid for out of the taxes.(Intld,) A. s - M.Ministry of Labour. 37th February,  1925.
