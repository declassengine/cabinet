(This document is the property of His Britannic L&quot;ajesty&apos;s Government).CABINET. SECRET. _   &apos;CP.  174(85).HOME. AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.yWILD BIRDS PROTECTION BILL. Memorandum by trie Home Secretary.I desire the authority of my colleagues to proceed in the House of Commons with the annexed Wild Birds Protection Bill. It is a consolidating and amending measure and is based upon a -Report  (1919) of a Departmental Committee and upon subsequent suggestions of the Wild Birds Advisory Committees which have been appointed to advise the Home Office and the Scottish Office on matters of Wild Birds Protection.      It is a non-party;Bill which is desired in many quarters in order to strengthen the existing law in the light of experience which has been gained and to make it more simple and uniform.      It is of a technical character,  and I do not think I need draw special attention to any of its provisions except perhaps those relating to the lapwing - a most useful bird whioh is generally agreed to be urgently in need of the utmost protection possible.The Bill in substantially its present form was conducted through the House of Lords in 1923 by Lord Grey of Fallodon, Chairman of the English Advisory Committee, but for want of time could not be taken in the House of Commons.      After consulting Lord Grey I have come to the conclusion that it should be introduced in that House on this occasion.It is not anticipated that the Bill will be at&apos; all controversial though one or two members of the House may oppose some of its provisions and it should not therefore take up much Parliamentary time;    and as it has now been left over for several years I think the time is ripe when the Government should take active steps to secure its passage through Parliament.W.J.H.21st March,  1925.13
