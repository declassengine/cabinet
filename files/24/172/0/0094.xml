(&quot;This Document is the Property of Big Britannic Majesty^ Government. 1 [OlltGUWATFD to THE CABINET BY direction of THE SECRETARY of STATE for44l HALLjAg^:&quot; Foreign Affairs.][E 1727/176/44]TURKISH 7PROPOSALS FOR A DIRECT SETTLEMENT OF THE TURCO-IRAK FRONTIER QUESTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE a note received from the Turkish Minister2. On various occasions during and since the protracted negotiations over the question of Mosul the Turks have proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should hand the vilayet over to them in return for economic and commercial advantages. They have throughout believed or thought it politic to affect a belief that the real interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the vilayet was the oil that might be obtained from it, and to us and to others they have continually suggested that our policy were dictated by the oil interests, and that if they were safeguarded the fate of the vilayet was indifferent to us.3. It will suffice briefly to enumerate their more notable attempts to reach a solution on these lines. The first occasion was at Lausanne, when an offer was made to Lord Curzon at a private interview to settle various outstanding matters, such as the Thracian frontier, in accordance with the British point of view, in return for the cession of the Mosul Vilayet to Turkey. Next, after the Constantinople Conference in May and June 1924 had disclosed a wide and irreconcilable divergence between the claims put forward on behalf of Turkey and Irak respectively, and after the issue had, in conformity with the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne, been referred for decision to the League of Nations, the Turkish Government continued to express a preference for a direct settlement without, however, submitting any concrete proposals. In the course of last autumn the present Turkish Minister in London approached the late Prime Minister with suggestions for a solution favourable to Turkish demands, in return for commercial advantages. Meanwhile offers of concessions had been made to various British financial groups on the understanding that they should influence His Majesty&apos;s Government in favour of a direct settlement in satisfaction of the Turkish claim. Lastly, I was approached by the Turkish Minister in January of this year. A record of the interview was circulated to the Cabinet at the time, and a copy is attached to this note for convenience of reference. At this interview I stated clearly to Zekiai Bey that His Maiesty&apos;s Government could not consent to bargain away the rights of Irak, of which we were the trustees, in exchange for economic advantages to British subjects, and that it would be useless for the Turkish Government to submit any proposals based on such a suggestion. Nevertheless, in spite of this explicit warning, it will be seen that the Turkish Government have now made formal proposals for an agreement on just this basis.4. It will be further noted that His Majesty&apos;s Government are asked to bind themselves to a quite inequitable betrayal of the legitimate interests of the bondholders of the Ottoman Debt, both British and foreign, by endorsing Turkey&apos;s repudiation of her financial obligations. (It may be remarked in passing that this would constitute the most unpropitious preliminary to the very considerable investment of British capital and the flotation of a loan on the London market,, which are contemplated under the proposed agreement.) In return for the abandonment of the rights of the people of Irak and of the bondholders, the Turks offer a great variety of concessions for the exploitation of oil, the construction of&quot; ports and railways, and the dubious privilege of advancing Turkey  15 million.. An arbitration treaty and a commercial convention are thrown in as further&apos; make-weights.5. It is not the first time that we have heard of these wholesale offers of concessions. Some of them figure in the Franklin-Bouillon treaty with the French of 1921 and in the famous Chester concession. Some of them, with or without authority, have been hawked about the City of London. When they are offered by the Turkish Government, it is with the purpose of attaining some immediate political2794   [12934] b
end, after which they can, if desired, be withdrawn for similar use elsewhere on a subsequent occasion. When they are offered to financial groups the object has been, first, to bring pressure to bear on His Majesty&apos;s Government over the question of Mosul, and secondly, to attract foreign, capital to Anatolia. Yet, while Admiral Chester is trying to raise capital on them in New York and someone else in London, both equally unsuccessfully, the Turkish Government are found peddling them in a third quarter. It is now suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should indicate to the Turkish Government the British groups who are prepared to undertake these very considerable investments in Anatolia, but it is very doubtful if the City would be found willing to risk a tenth part of the capital required. For, in effect, the Turkish offer amounts to a call for an enormous investment of capital without any adequate security. Turkish limited liability companies are to be formed to exploit the railways and ports in question, and they would, of course, be subject to Turkish law and Turkish control. The fate of past investments in Turkey does not encourage whole-hearted confidence in the security offered, and it is questionable whether, when it came to specifying the conditions of the contracts, agreement would be attainable between the demands of the Turkish Government and the guarantees required by the British investors. It is even more improbable, in present conditions, that Turkey would be able to place a loan of  15 million on the London market, and it is, I conceive, undesirable in the interest of the general financial policy of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that she should be encouraged to do so.6. It is clearly incumbent on me to submit these proposals to my colleagues, but I trust that they will support me in the line which I took with the Turkish Minister on the 21st January. There can, I submit, be no question at this stage of with-d rawing the question from the cognisance of the League still less of bargaining away rights and interests of which we are trustees on behalf of the people of Irak in exchange for economic concessions to British financial groups. A surrender on this point would involve (1) a complete reversal of policy on our part, (2) a disregard of the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne, (3) a cynical renunciation of the claim that we have solemnly and consistently urged on behalf of Irak on racial, economic, geographical and strategic grounds, (4) a highly discreditable desertion, both of the people of Irak and the Christian inhabitants of the north of the Mosul Vilayet, (5) a substantial risk of getting the worst of a discreditable bargain, and (6) marked discourtesy to the League of Nations, whose Commission of Enquiry have just completed an exhaustive local investigation lasting two months, and are about to frame their recommendations.7. In the circumstances, therefore, I propose to return a firm but polite refusal to the offer communicated by the Turkish Minister.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.April 2, 1925.Enclosure 1.Zekiai Beg to Mr. Austen Chamberlain.Legation de la Republique turque, Londres, M. le Manistre, &apos; le 19 mars 1925.J&apos;AI 1&apos;honneur de transmettre ci-inclus a votre Excellence un projet d&apos;arrange-ment prepare par mon Gouvernement en s&apos;inspirant des idees echangees dans notre entrevue du 24 Janvier dernier, relative aux questions interessant les deux pays.En remettant ce document a votre Excellence, je reponds au desir qu&apos;elle avait bien voulu m&apos;exprimer, d&apos;etre fixee sur le consentement effectif de mon Gouvernement a ce projet.Je me tiens, par consequent, a la disposition de votre Excellence, pour lui remettre, quand elle voudra, les pleins pouvoirs m&apos;autorisant a negocier et signer ad referendum un accord permettant de resoudre d&apos;une facon amicale et directement entre nous la question de Mossoul.

Zekiai Bey observed that he had had more than one conversation with Sir William Tyrrell, but this was his first opportunity of speaking to me about the relations between our two countries.  It appeared to him that Turkey offered a great
sphere for economic collaboration between the two countries. Were there, he asked himself, any political obstacles to such economic collaboration? He saw no insuperable obstacles either on the Turkish or on the British side. He thought, therefore, that such a collaboration was possible, and that the &quot;little affair&quot; of Mosul ought not to interpose an obstacle. All depended upon the attitude of the British Government and whether it was disposed to see Turkey established as a strong and stable Power.3. I replied that there was no desire on the side of His Majesty&apos;s Government or the British people except to cultivate friendly relations with Turkey as now established.4. Encouraged by this expression of our general policy, the Turkish Minister approached the question which really lay at the root of his demand for an interview. Why could we not settle together the question of the Mosul boundary without waiting for the decision of the League of Nations ? For Turkey this was a vital matter. She could not acquiesce in the division of the Kurds. If we could agree to cede Mosul to Turkey, arrangements in regard to economic interests could easily be made. We might, he indicated, have the exploitation of the oil-fields and a guarantee from Turkey, as far as she was concerned, of the integrity of Irak as thus delimited.5. I told Zekiai Bey that I regretted that the Turkish Government and our own had been unable to reach an accord on this subject at Lausanne. In spite of Lord Curzon&apos;s express declarations, the Turkish Government appeared still to be under the illusion that the policy of the British Government was influenced by some interest in the oil-fields which might be found in that quarter. This was a complete delusion, but, putting that misapprehension aside, and turning to the substance of his proposal, what was the actual position ? We had agreed to refer our difference to the League of Nations. We had stated our case in our capacity as the mandatories of Irak and trustees for the people of that country, and it was impossible that I should bargain away their rights or interests against economic concessions to Britain or British citizens. Having once referred the matter to the League, we had better await the League&apos;s decision, which His Majesty&apos;s Government had in advance pledged themselves to accept.6. Zekiai Bey then began to suggest that if the decision of the League was adverse Turkey might be unable to acquiesce. I told him that I could not suppose that in this he was speaking the mind of his Government. It would be a serious thing for the Turkish Government to defy the British Empire, a still more serious thing, perhaps, for Turkey to place itself in opposition to the body which represented, as far as anything could represent, the consensus of civilised opinion. I was sure that there was too much wisdom in the councils of Angora for them to take so very grave a decision.7. Zekiai Bey turned around this point for some time, developing Turkish difficulties, suggesting an exchange of populations and so forth; but I declined to alter my position. I was wholly at one with him in desiring friendly relations between Turkey and Great Britain. I saw great economic advantages, especially for Turkey, in a cordial friendship between us, though I warned him incidentally that there could be no idea of a loan from the British Government; but I added that I did not think that we could usefully take up again the fruitless discussions of Lausanne, and that we should be wiser to await and to accept the decision of the Council of the League.8. The Minister then asked me whether I refused to consider any proposals for an understanding. I told him that if the Turkish Government authorised him to make specific proposals I would, of course, give them most serious consideration, but I deprecated his making any such proposals if their basis was to be the cession of Mosul in return for economic concessions, for to such proposals I could only return a negative; and, in the second place, I insisted that if any proposals were to be made they must not be mere feelers on his part, for which the time had gone by, but proposals definitely authorised by his Government and by which that Government was prepared to stand.9. Before leaving, Zekiai Bey asked whether, in the event of Turkey deciding to join the League of Nations, Great Britain would support a request by her for a permanent seat on the council. I told him that this was a request which apparently was going to be made to me by every country in turn. I could only say to him, as to others, that I must reserve our liberty till the question arose at Geneva.I am, &amp;c.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.o
