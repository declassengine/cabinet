[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.      February 1925.SECRET.CP. 104 (25).HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. Government of India (Civil Services) Bill.MEMORANDUM CIRCULATED BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  INDIA.This Bill, the object of which is to make effective the decisions taken upon the recommendations of Lord Lee&apos;s Indian Public Services Commission^ Report, has already been approved in principle by the Cabinet (Conclusion No., T of Cabinet No. 60 of 19th November 1924). I desire to introduce it as soon as possible in the House of Lords.Clause 1. In order to protect all the emoluments and allowances of persons to whom the concessions recommended by the Commission are to be granted against the risk of rejection by the Indian Legislatures, it is proposed to amend sections 67a and 72d of the Government of India Act (a) by defining and extending the meaning of the expression &quot; salaries and pensions,&quot; which are not votable, and (6) by extending the classes of persons whose &quot;salaries and pensions,&quot; as how to be defined, are to be made not votable.As regards the first point, it is probable that the intention of the framers of the Act of 1919 was to exempt from the vote all emoluments and official payments of all kinds, whether by way of remuneration or pension, payable to protected persons. The use of the word &quot; salaries &quot; without explanation in the original Act has made it necessary, in the past, to include under that heading various payments which cannot, except by a straining of language, be regarded as falling within the term &quot;salaries.&quot; Moreover, the decisions taken on Lord Lee&apos;s Commission^ proposals involve con-cessions, notably the grant of free passages, which it would be impossible, as the Act stands, to class as &quot; salary.&quot;As regards the second point, these concessions are to be granted to certain categories of Services whose members are not appointed by the Secretary of State in Council and, consequently, whose &quot; salaries and pensions,&quot; however interpreted, would not be covered by the sections as they stand. The new paras, (iii), inserted in both sections by sub-clauses (1) and (3) of clause 1 oi: the Bill, extend the classes of persons to he protected accordingly.The new paras, (iv), also inserted by sub-clauses (1) and (3) of clause 1 of the Bill, do not arise directly out of the Commission^ Report, but their insertion has been recommended by the Government of India in order to remove the difficulty which might arise under the existing law if, as the result of any appeal by a member of any Service whose salary and pension is not normally protected, an award made by the appellate authority were to be reversed or modified by a subsequent vote of a Legislative Council.The retrospective date in clause 1 (1st April 1924) is the date with effect from which, as already publicly announced, the concessions recommended by the Commission have been granted.Clause 2.- This amendment also does not arise directly out of the Lee Report, but has a very close indirect bearing upon Service payments generally.Section 96b of the Act (inserted in 1919) required the Secretary of State in Council for the first time to regulate all Service matters (pay and pensions, con-ditions of service, and the like) by statutory rules. In accordance with generally accepted principles, such rules, when framed, are rigid and cannot be departed from or altered otherwise than by formal amendment, and it is, consequently, impossible, in any individual case of hardship to which, on account of peculiar circumstances, the provisions of the rule may give rise, to depart from their provisions. The new 171      100 ; 2.25C O
psubsection (5), inserted by clause 2, is intended to remove this disability and to enable the Secretary of State in Council, as he had always done before 1919 when he was not restricted by statutory rules, to make exceptions in individual cases, if:such seems to be in justice required, and to empower other rule-making authorities \(the * Government of India and local Governments) to do the same. It has &quot;been found impracticable, in framing:rules to moot dBase reomplex &quot;Indian conditions, to provide for all possible contingencies, and the effect-of the section as it stands tends, con-sequently, to prejudice the interests of the services for whose protection it was primarily enaGted.Clause 3 inserts the usual printing clause, the use of which was inaugurated by  the/Act cof 11919, .and which  has -the ^effect cdf automatically keeping ffbe consolidated Act amended up-to-date.ist  February 1925.BIKIiE.NH.EAB.
