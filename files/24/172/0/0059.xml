This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^s Government.] n159 &amp;)   .   \*\7fpiRCTXS&apos;EEtf,T6 the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of State for &quot;&quot; Foreign Affairs.[C 3753/457/18]Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Sir Eyre Crowe. (Received March 16.)British Delegation, Geneva, My dear Crowe, March 14, 1925.I ASKED the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs to call upon me yesterday evening after the long sitting of the council, which had been almost entirely occupied by the disputes between Poland and Danzig.I must admit that M. Skrzynski, who is said to pride himself on being both the handsomest and youngest Minister for Foreign Affairs, had not made an agreeable impression on me when I met him in society, and had seemed to me perfectly disagreeable in his attitude during our council meeting. He presented, indeed, a curious contrast to the President of the Senate of Danzig. M. Skrzynski, who spoke excellent French, was all smiles and irony, but seemed to me to wear that air of uneasy assumption which those who are uncertain of their own position are apt to assume.M. Sahm, on the other hand, reminded me of the late Mr. Flavin, M.P., whom some of my colleagues will remember. He is a man of great stature, with a strong, brutal face, which was grimly set during the whole of the proceedings. He spoke German, and, whether from necessity or calculation, appeared to depend upon the English translation for the sense of M. Skrzynskfs French.M. Briand observed to me that merely to look at the two men was to appreciate the whole question. The President of the Danzig Senate refused to look at the Polish Minister, and did not attempt to conceal either his dislike or contempt. M. Briand added later that if they met in a dark lane he knew which of them would return.Having formed this unfavourable impression of ML Skrzynski, I was very agreeably surprised when, opening our conversation in good English, he spoke simply and directly, with none of the swagger or conceit which had seemed to me a constant part of his public form. A few words upon the position in Danzig, with which city M. Skrzynski said that Poland would get along very well if it were not for the opposition and ill-will organised by Berlin, brought me at once to the question of security. I sketched very rapidly for our time was limited the reasons which led His Majesty&apos;s Government to attach so much importance to the German proposals, and to the opening which they might be found to afford for reconstituting the society of European nations. I told M. Skrzynski that, if there was a chance of increasing the guarantees for peace, and of removing those brooding fears of which I had spoken in my declaration at the council, it seemed to me that Poland had an even greater interest in seizing this chance tban any other of the Allies. Poland stood between two great nations in a position of danger which her tragic history must make only too plain. Surely it was in the interest of Poland to come to terms if possible with at least one of those Great Powers. Did he not think that it would be easier to cultivate good, and even friendly, relations with the German Reich than with the Soviet Union 1 I had tried to put myself in the position of a Pole, and to think what was the true interest of Poland. I begged him to&apos; consider whether there was not some force in what I had said to him.M. Skrzynski listened with close attention and, I thought, with growing interest as the conversation proceeded. He began by arguing that, on the one hand, Germany gave nothing to which she was not already pledged by the Treaty of Versailles; on the other hand, that she gained nothing; and it was therefore legitimate to suspect the good faith of her proposals. But he observed that what he most feared and disliked was the idea that the three Western Powers and Italy should enter into a general pact with Germany, which would appear to &quot; legitimise &quot; her aspirations for changes in her eastern frontier. He had, as I have mentioned, been speaking English, but he formulated this phrase in French, and repeated it more than once.I replied that I had, of course, no cut-and-dried plan in my mind and no propositions to lay before him.   All that I wished him to do was to think very2737-4   [12849]
seriously over the arguments that 1 had addressed to him, to consider whether Poland&apos;s real interest did not lie in following up these overtures, and at any rate not to close his mind or to attempt to prejudice French opinion against a serious study of them, I observed that the very fact that Germany would not make exactly the same declaration with regard to the east as to the west was a proof of her &quot;good faith, for, if she had no serious intention of keeping her engagements., it would be a matter of indifference to her what pledges she gave. Further, i observed that, in refusing to renounce for ever the hope of securing some modification in the arrange-ments on her eastern border, Germany was after all only following the example of France. France had in fact abandoned all hope of regaining Alsace-Lorraine, and would never have declared war for the purpose of reversing the verdict of 1870, but France had, nevertheless, always (and notably at the time of the German negotiations for an anti-English Union during the South African war) refused publicly to renounce all hope that Alsace-Lorraine might some day be restored to her. Was it unreasonable in Germany to refuse in respect of her eastern frontiers what France had always refused to her in respect of her western ones ?M. Skrzynski again emphasised his fear of any pact including both the west and the east, which by a difference of language might seem to &quot; legitimise&quot; the German claims in the east. After all, if Germany joined the League of Nations, article 19 was always open to her. I hastened to say : &quot; Then if Germany joined the League and, publicly renouncing any idea of war, accepted article 19 as the method for solving her problems, you would not object,&quot; He would not absolutely pin himself to this view. Indeed, he said that in such grave matters he must necessarily consult his Colleagues, and could not make any declaration of policy except after careful consideration, but he assured me that he would most carefully consider what I had said. He regretted that words like mine were not heard by the Polish people, who were made anxious by certain articles in the English journals. He was grateful to me for the way in which I had spoken to him. It was not his policy to be a trouble-fete in Europe, and he would be only too glad to find a way to better relations &quot;between the adjoining nations. He offered to come to London at any time if I desired to pursue the conversation, for though he had every confidence in M. Skirmunt, he thought that questions of this high importance were better treated personally by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs.I have omitted to say that I told him I had no idea of signing any pact which included a reference to the eastern frontiers of Germany. He would recognise that Great Britain was in a different position from France, inasmuch as our obligations to Poland were only those of one member of the League of Nations to another, whereas France had, in addition, the obligations of her alliance which she intended to observe loyally, as M. Herriot had declared in his conversation with me. Any pact into which we might enter, if our co-operation could facilitate the great work of pacification, would necessarily be confined to those frontiers in which we had an immediate interest. I would venture, however, to suggest that the elimination of the risk of war in the west would itself be an additional security for peace in the cast, and that I earnestly trusted that Poland would consider her responsibility to her ally and not prevent France from obtaining additional security if such were within her reach.M. Skrzynski assured me that he had no desire to stand in the way of France.Altogether, the interview seemed to me satisfactory, I believe that it went far to remove from M. Skrzynski&apos;,s mind the feelings which had influenced his conversations and published statements in Paris, and that he will at least regard the attitude of England and the proposals which we have supported in a different light from that in which he had previously seen them. My impression is confirmed by the fact that later in the evening he told M. Qui nones de Leon that he had been much touched &quot; by my words. He repeated the same words to Sir Eric Drummond this morning, and he used similar language to M. Briand. M. Briand himself is ilnder no illusions as to the impossibility of permanently maintaining the present arrangements in Eastern Europe. He observed to me this morning, when I spoke of this conversation, that M. Skrzynski would leave Geneva wiser than he came, and that if Germany would only join the League and trust to time and article 19 of the covenant, the council itself, after a series of such sittings as we had yesterday, would become convinced that some change must be made. M. Briand informed me that he had had a telephone message from Paris that the effect produced by the British declaration on the protocol was not bad. Unless I am wholly mistaken, and indeed, unless his whole language and attitude are deliberately adopted to conceal his thoughts, he is ardently desirous to find some method of working within
rthe cadre which I have traced, and I count upon his influence with M. Herriot and with French opinion to produce by degrees a better attitude in Paris, provided we stand firmly by our policy and make good the expectations that my speech in the House of Commons and my conversations with M. Herriot and the other statesmen I have seen here, have raised. M. Briand told me that M. Benes, who, as he remarked, was the more intelligent of the two, &quot; travaillerait&quot; M. Skrzynski and he believed that we should presently find him more moderate and reasonable. Provided, therefore, our policy is consistently maintained and steadily pressed forward, I am not unhopeful that we may work a great and beneficent change in the European situation; but it may be taken as certain that no improvement can take place without our active co-operation, and that to withdraw now would not merely be to raise a universal outcry against the perfidy of Great Britain, but to plunge Europe into disaster.Yours sincerely,AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN&quot;.
