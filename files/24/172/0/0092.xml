As explained to East African Commission I strongly favour the completion of the Benguella line subject to reasonable hope of branch line to link up Benguella line with Rhodesia line through known mineralised portion of North Western Rhodesia thus opening up our mineral areas and giving us access to the West Coast harbours.     Assume that all possible precautions would be taken to secure effective control over the Benguella line remaining in British hands.Some of our farmers might conceivably fear the increased competition in the Katanga market and urge prior claims of Sinoia Kafue line as likely to preserve most of the&apos; Katanga trade to the east coast  route via Rhodesia. Personally think that enhanced prosperity of Katanga throughNo. 175. &quot; 1 &quot;IIS DOCUMENT  13 THE PROPERTY OP II18 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S  GOVERNMENT),
access to the west coast likely so to expand the market as to leave sufficient capacity for Northern Rhodesia products and that the opening up of our own mineral areas would in addition afford valuable new local markets. Further that the c on struct ion of Sinois extension more likely if the west coast competition had to be met than w ithout such c omoe t it ion.Should not anticipate any serious perturbation of local opinion but very difficult to predict confidently.(II)TELEGRAM IMP.  218 aTelegram fro:1 the Governor of SOUTHERN RHODESIA, to the Secretary, of State for the Colonies,      Dated 27th March,Your telegram of 13th March.        While my Ministers would deeply regret that if any attitude they might adopt towards the proposals to finance the extension of the Benguella Railway by guarantee under the  Imperial Trade Facilities Aot should react unfavourably upon serious state of unemploy-ment at present existing in the United Kingdom they feel bound    to point out that the extension of this railway will introduce a foreign competitive factor  into carrying trade hitherto enjoyed by the railways of this colony with the Belgian Congo.      These railways have been built and equipped entirely by British, capital and such competition would be calculated to result in material injury to the interests of this Colony.      The extent of that competition may be   gauged from published bulletin ho.14 of the Rhodesian Railways dated 1st January 1925 from which it will be seen that the Congo traffic accounts for upwards of 50% of the total revenue x    No.  175.
derived from all  sources by the Rhq.desIan Railways during the year ended 50th September , 1924.     ministers therefore feel sure that local feeling would in the circumstances be adverse to the proposals.      Ministers desire to Point out further that similar proposals were objected to in Kay, 1922, by the Government of the union of South Africa which is also interested in the Congo carrying trade.      That objectiorywas concurred in by tie then administration of Southern Rhodesia and elected members of  the Legislative Council.      In response to a communication from this Government last month on the same subject as the present, Union Government whilst not adhering to the policy of their predecessors in office in this matter expressed the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government knowing the position in South Africa would not fail to safeguard the interests of the Union and Rhodesia a hope which is shared by this2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, April 1st, 1925 a
