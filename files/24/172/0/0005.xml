[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.&quot;Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.SECRET. Copy No.     gO.P. 105 (25).CABINET.THE GENEVA PROTOCOL AND SECURITY.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence.IN November last the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs confirmed his predecessors action, in referring the question of the Geneva Protocol and security to the Committee of Imperial Defence. That Committee, on which Lord Balfour was invited by the Prime Minister and consented to serve, in addition to the Ministers and chief officials of all the Departments concerned, has held four long sittings, on the 4th and 16th December, .the 13th and 19th February, devoted exclusively to the consideration of this subject. The interval between the second and third meetings was occupied by the deliberations of a Sub-Committee, consisting of the representatives of the principal Departments, presided over by Sir Maurice Hankey, which was instructed to examine the questions how far the Protocol, which had been severely criticised in Departmental Memoranda and at the opening meetings of the main Committee, was susceptible of being amended to meet the criticisms that had been passed upon it, and alternatively upon what lines it would be desirable to proceed, if it were proposed to substitute any other instrument for it. .        &apos;.2. The Sub-Committee held a large number of sittings in which it greatly lightened the labours of the Committee of Imperial Defence by an exhaustive examination of the text of the Protocol. It ended by producing a Report, which is circulated herewith (C.I.D. Paper No. 559-B), and which will be found to consist of a powerful but measured condemnation of the Protocol in its more salient features. In compliance with their terms of reference, however, and realising that it was the desire of the Committee of Imperial Defence and of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the attitude to be adopted should not be merely of a negative or destructive character, the Sub-Committee, after proposing the definite rejection of the articles in the Protocol relating to compulsory arbitration, suspension of defensive measures during proceedings for pacific settlement, threat of aggression, and reparation and maintenance in all circumstances of territorial integrity and political independence: which had been universally condemned proceeded to frame a series of proposals in the form of amendments to the Covenant of the League of Nations. Although they did not propose that these amendments should come: into operation until they had become part of the Covenant, they embodied them, in the form of an amended Protocol, with a view to facilitating their acceptance by the States which had signed the latter instrument.Feeling that the virtual rejection of the Protocol would leave still unsolved the question of French and Belgian Security at any rate in the opinion of those Powers the Sub-Committee further drew up the draft of a suggested Declaration on the latter subject, in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government deciding to adopt the policy of a guarantee.     \\The discussion of the Report of the Sub-Committee was then taken up at the ensuing meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Simultaneously Lord Balfour, who at the opening meeting of the latter had indicated a possible line of reply to the Powers, should His Majesty&apos;s Government decide that the Protocol could not be adopted, was good enough to prepare a draft Despatch for considera-; tion. This draft and the Report were thereupon considered together, and formed [12732]
the basis of the conclusions which it is my duty as Chairman.of the.Committee now to report.Upon one point the Committee were quite unanimous, viz., that the Geneva Protocol in its existing form is incapable of being accepted. This opinion has been confirmed -by the reports so far received of the views of the Dominions, which are equally unanimous. It does not seem necessary in this Memorandum to restate the reasons which have led the Committee of Imperial Defence to arrive at this conclusion. They can be found in the papers circulated ^herewith, and were further concurred in by all the Departments concerned.This therefore is the first recommendation that is made by the Committee to the Cabinet.The subsequent discussion turned, in the main, upon two questions : firstly, in what form it would be desirable, after reference to the Dominions and India (a condition which is postulated at every stage) to publish the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government; secondly, whether, in doing so, it would be desirable to formulate an alternative policy, arid if so, what the alternative policy should be.Upon both these points there was some difference of opinion in the Committee. That a reply should be sent (after consultation with the Dominions and India) and sent with as little delay as possible, was universally agreed. There were some who held that this reply should be of a purely general character, indicating merely that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not accept the Protocol, but without attempting to formulate the reasons. The supporters of this view urged that to enter into an argument at this stage would merely provoke controversy, and would aggravate the disappointment that rejection by Great Britain must inevitably cause. That we could not accept is, it is true, generally anticipated, but it would be much better, it was argued, merely to state that fact, and to add that the British Government would presently, or at a later stage, make alternative proposals of their own.A second view was that the safest course would be merely to play for time by stating that we are still in consultation with the Dominions and India, and unable at present to give any answer at all.On the other hand, it was the view of the great majority of the &quot;Committee, in which the Foreign Secretary concurred, that it would, on the whole, be wiser, as well as more candid (it would also be in accordance with the precedent set by the late Government in rejecting the Treaty of Mutual Assistance), to state broadly, and without entering either into undue detail or into acutely controversial issues,, the grounds upon which the British Empire is obliged to reject the Protocol&apos;: and from this point of view Lord Balfour&apos;s draft, to which the Foreign Office suggested a few amendments, and which Lord Balfour himself at our last meeting undertook in certain particulars slightly to expand (OLD. Paper No. 589-B), was felt to supply an admirable basis for the proposed reply. Some doubts Were raised as to the concluding section of Lord Balfour&apos;s draft, which appeared to suggest an alternative policy of which some members of the Committee did not approve, and&apos; the feeling was expressed that, if the draft were accepted as a whole, it might he wise at the present stage to omit this section ;(No. V), all the more that it was held to be extremely unlikely that the Dominions would accept it in anything like its present shape.The second question to be submitted to the Cabinet, therefore, is this: Whether it is desirable to send to the League a simple refusal without argument; or to gain time by stating that we are not in a position to give an answer, or to forward the reasoned argument as drafted by Lord Balfour; and, in the latter case, whether the concluding paragraphs should or should not be included.The latter question led us directly to the much larger issue of Security. It was inevitable that our discussions should drift &quot;backwards and forwards between the subjects of the Protocol and Security, since it Was clear that if the Protocol were rejected, either with or without argument, the question of Security would at once be raised, and the British Government would he asked what they meant to do.It will have been observed that the Report of the Sub-Committee contemplated proceeding to Geneva With alternative proposals (whether couched in the form of a Protocol or not) for amending the Covenant. It is obvious, however, that this Would open a question of vast complexity, Of indefinite duration and of possible danger, and there were some members of the Committee who argued strongly against touching the Covenant at all and regarded it as absurd that the hurried
and rather histrionic discussions of three weeks at Geneva last autumn should necessitate the pulling to pieces, even in the guise of amendment, of an instrument such as the Covenant which had only been constructed with enormous difficulty, and which in many respects was doing its work very well. There was, further, the practical impossibility of obtaining the consent of the Dominions by telegraph or even by despatch, to so complicated and far-reaching a set of propositions. For the present, therefore, it was felt that these suggestions of the Sub-Committee could not be advantageously pursued.There still remained the question of an alternative policy. Upon this point there was also considerable difference of opinion. Some members of the Committee thought it unnecessary to formulate an alternative policy at the present stage at all, and believed that with the passage of time, and the pressure of economic and other forces, the question would gradually become easier of solution. Doubts were also expressed as to whether public opinion in the United Kingdom would be at all prepared to accept now the kind of guarantee that was offered to M. Poincare in 1922, and still more whether the Dominions would join in or acquiesce in our giving any such undertaking.In the course of the discussions it was suggested that these apprehensions might be to a large extent removed if Germany were also associated with the suggested guarantee, i.e., if there could be in some form a quadrilateral pledge for the security of the common frontiers. The Foreign Office undertook to examine this subject, and will presently submit their views to the Committee. It was represented that the present was an exceptionally favourable moment for such an attempt, owing to the friendly disposition of the German Government and the overtures already made by them. On the other hand, the difficulties of bringing in Germany in any practicable form were pointed out.As against those who were reluctant to embark too hastily upon the question of Security or of a revived Pact with France and Belgium at the present stage, the Foreign Secretary argued that the question could not be postponed, that the peace of Europe and the stability of our relations with our principal Allies depended upon it, and that unless the matter were seriously faced the future could only be regarded with grave apprehension.It was agreed that the careful examination of this problem is the next duty to which the Committee must now turn, and they hope before long to submit to the Cabinet their proposals about it. Whether the Cabinet desire at this stage to give them any definite instructions in the matter it is for the Cabinet to say.It may be desirable to indicate the procedure which, if the Cabinet arrive at a decision on the points submitted to them in this Memorandum, it will be found necessary to adopt. The draft reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the League, if decided upon by the Cabinet, will at once be telegraphed in full to the Dominions with a view to obtaining their approval. It is manifest, therefore, that the fewer contentious issues (as between us and them) that it raises the better. If their assent be given the reply will then be sent to Geneva. That it will be possible to do this before the next meeting of the Council early in March is in the highest degree unlikely. That the Council should expect it would be equally unreasonable.Meanwhile the larger issue of Security and of a possible Pact will be pushed forward by the Committee. The Colonial Secretary, however, will inform the Cabinet that he is doubtful whether the assent of the Dominions to such a step  assuming that a definite proposal has been drawn up and approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government can be procured without personal consultation with Dominion representatives. That, again, will depend upon the exact nature of the proposals to which their assent is sought.The arguments which haye been briefly summarised in this Memorandum will be found more fully developed in the verbatim reports of the four meetings* of the Committee which are circulated herewith.It is requested that after the Cabinet meeting these should be returned without fail to the Secretary.(Initialled) C. of K.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, February 19, 19:25.* Reports of the two meetings held before Christmas have already been circulated to the Cabinet, but ;are recirculated for convenience of reference.

Report.PART I.-PRELIMINARY REMARKS.BEFORE dealing in detail with our Terms of Reference, as set forth on the opposite page, we wish to draw attention to certain considerations which are of importance to a proper understanding of the Geneva Protocol.2. It will be remembered that, by the terms of Article 8 of the Covenant, the Members of the League &quot; recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations.&quot; Article 8 further enjoins that &quot;The Council, taking account of the geographical situation and circumstances of each State, shall formulate plans for such reduction for the consideration and action of the several Governments.&apos;&apos;3. Ever since the formation of the League of Nations the Council has been engaged in the attempt to carry out its responsibilities in this matter, which has also formed the subject of prolonged discussion and investigation at the successive annual meetings of the Assembly.4. Up to the present time, however, the League of Nations can claim no actual result for its efforts. Such progress as. has been made in the direction of reduction of armament and in the aggregate it is not inconsiderable has been due to causes outside the League, such as the disarmament provisions of the various Treaties of Peace, the Washington Conference, and the spontaneous action of States themselves owing to circumstances of reduced risk or under the pressure of financial exigency.5. The reason why the efforts of the League have not proved more productive is generally ascribed partly to the fact that the League is not as universal as was anticipated and partly to the lack of confidence among the nations of continental Europe. When they are asked to reduce their armaments they are apt to point to their potential danger from the ex-enemy States, and more especially from Germany, as well as from Russia. &quot; How can we reduce our armaments,&quot; they ask, &quot; unless we are secured by some other means against these future risks ? &apos;&apos;6. Nowhere is this feeling of insecurity more deeply seated than in the French nation. France has never considered the security provisions of the Treaty of Versailles as a sufficient safeguard. During the Paris peace conference she demanded the political separation of the Rhineland from the Reich, and its organisation as an autonomous State or group of nations under the League of Nations armed with effective force. She was only induced to give up this demand by the promise of the guarantee treaties attached n to the Treaty of Versailles. These guarantee treaties, however, fell through when the United States failed to ratify, and France has therefore declared herself forced to look elsewhere for her security.7. Since that time France has attempted by various expedients to obtain the additional security at which she aims. The first and most important of these attempts was the bilateral pact broached at Cannes in 1922. The negotiations, however, eventually broke down, one of the main obstacles being the refusal of His Majesty&apos;s Government to incur the definite military and political commitments which M. poincare considered AIN indispensable condition of a pact. France&apos;s second expedient was a series of military agreements which she has concluded with Belgium, Poland and Czechoslovakia, under which these States are bound to join France in the event of her being attacked by Germany. Other French expedients for obtaining security were the abortive separationist movement in the Rhineland, and the various attempts, begun at the Peace Conference in 1919, to develop the League into a formidable organisation for her protection.8. The question of French security was raised by M. Herriot in his conversation ivith Mr. Ramsay MacDonald in May 1924, when in the course of the discussion respecting German reparation payments he said : &quot; I should like to say at once that[12506] b 2
I should prefer France not to be paid if she had to renounce her security.&quot; Mr. MacDonald, however, made it clear that the immediate problem was the Experts&apos; Report or Dawes Scheme. &quot; Let us therefore,&quot; he said, &quot; first settle the question of the experts; then we will go on to that of inter-Allied debts, then to the problem of security.&quot; At the subsequent meeting in Paris on the 9th July, 1924, between Mr. MacDonald and M. Herriot, a memorandum was drawn up, which included the following statement:  &quot; The two Governments have likewise proceeded to a preliminary exchange of views on the question of security. They are aware that public opinion requires pacification; they agree to co-operate in devising, through the League of Nations or otherwise, as opportunity presents itself, means of securing this, and to continue the consideration of the question until the problem of general security can be finally solved.&apos;&apos;9. On the 11th August, 1924, during the London Conference on Reparation, M. Herriot addressed a letter to Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, transmitting a memo-randum on French security, in which, besides certain demands for the strict execution of the guarantees provided by the Treaty of Versailles, he included a demand for the following &quot; supplementary guarantees &quot; : &quot; (a.) Conclusion between France and England of a defensive pact destined to replace that concluded in 1919; this pact, anessential factor in the maintenance of peace in Europe, would be completed by similar defensive pacts concluded between the Allies neighbouring on Germany;&quot; (&amp;.) Conclusion between the signatories of the above-mentioned pact and Germany of a reciprocal undertaking of non-aggression, this undertaking and these pacts being placed under the safeguard of the League of Nations;&quot; (c.) Reinforcement of the effective authority of the League of Nations by the efficacious organisation of mutual assistance against States guilty of aggression.&quot;10. It should be noted that these demands are complementary and not alter-native. It has been made abundantly clear that even if, by means of the Geneva Protocol or otherwise, France obtains increased security from the League of Nations, she will yet not be willing to renounce the Anglo-French pact. From the above summary it will be seen that the British Empire Delegates at Geneva had, as a background for their deliberations, to bear in mind not only the general obligation of the League to find some basis for the reduction of armaments, but also the specific pledge given by the then Prime Minister at Paris on the 9th July to co-operate in devising, through the League of Nations or otherwise, as opportunity presents itself, means of providing for French security.11. The wording of the third of M. Herriot&apos;s &quot;supplementary guarantees&quot; (see above, paragraph 9 (c) ), gave a clear warning of what France was out to obtain at Geneva. The authority of the League was to be reinforced by an efficacious organisation of mutual assistance against an aggressor. As a general observation on the Geneva Protocol, we consider it important to draw attention to the fact that many of the principal innovations contained therein have already been proposed in some shape or form and rejected by the British Government either at the Paris peace conference in 1919 or later in the discussion of the first draft of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice or the draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance. At the same time the Protocol tends to emphasise and extend provisions of the Covenant which were accepted with hesitation and which have been viewed with misgiving by British Government Departments since the United States of America decided not to become a member of the League of Nations.12. According to President Wilson, who was one of the main originators of the Covenant of the League of Nations, it was based on the idea of bringing the public opinion of the world to bear so as to prevent wars. Reliance was placed on moral, rather than on material, force, which was kept in the background. To quote President Wilson: &quot;In order to safeguard, so far as we could, the popular power of this repre-sentative body, it is provided, you will notice, that when a subject is submitted, not to arbitration, but to discussion by the executive council, it can, upon the initiative of either one of the parties to the dispute, be drawn out of the execu-tive council into the larger forum of the general body of delegates; because throughout this instrument we are depending primarily and chiefly upon one
great force, and that is the moral force of the public opinion of the world the cleansing and clarifying and compelling influences of publicity; so that intrigues can no longer have their coverts, so that designs that are sinister can at any time be drawn into the open, so that those things that are destroyed by the light may be promptly destroyed by the overwhelming light of the univer-sal expression of the condemnation of the world.&quot; Armed force is. in the background in this programme, but it is in the background, and if the moral force of the world will not suffice, the physical force of the world shall. But that is the last1 resort, because this is intended as a constitution of peace, not as a league of war.&quot; (Extract from Protocol No. B, Plenary Session, Paris Peace Conference, February 14, 1919.)(The italics are not in the original.)13. The tendency of the Geneva Protocol is unequivocally in a different1 direction. To quote a recent speech by M. van Karnebeek, the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs, in the Second Chamber, as reported by His Majesty&apos;s Minister at The Hague : &apos;&apos; In reply to a question whether he himself accepted the new system, M van Karnebeek said that his own preference had always been for the develop^ ment of the League of Nations in such a way that the coercive element should not become the axis round which the whole system would revolve. The system of the Protocol was a move in the direction of force, and his Excellency feared that, if the League was to derive its authority from coercion, the strength and prestige which it derives from the consciousness of justice, which should be its principal foundation, might perhaps be weakened.&quot; (S&apos;ir C. Marling&apos;s des-patch of the 15th December, 1924.)14. We are at a parting of the ways. Is the League to develop gradually on the lines of the Covenant with a view to achieve pacification by forming the habit among nations of bringing their differences and apprehensions to the Council for settle-ment with, moral force as the principal weapon and with material force in the back-ground as a last resort, or is it to be given a new orientation by superimposing on the Covenant a system of compulsory arbitration closely supported by coercion ? We have proceeded on the assumption that the former system is preferred by His Majesty&apos;s Government as the basis of the League&apos;s activities.15. In this connection we should like to point out the special difficulty which would be created for the British Empire by any development of the provisions of the Covenant in the direction of coercion framed to meet European conditions. The Empire, unlike most of the Powers interested in the Protocol, is by no means a. purely European Power, and the Dominion Governments have no interest in being involved in coercive measures or hostilities in Europe when the Empire itself is not directly threatened. By becoming parties to any general agreement for coercion they would, in fact, abandon all the advantages which they, like the United States of America, draw from their geographical position. The same consideration applies to India. India lies under the added disadvantage that the immediate neighbours with whom she is most likely to find herself involved are either not members or only very ineffective members of the League. A League of Nations policy developed on such lines cannot, therefore, be acceptable to the Empire.16. Another general observation which we wish to make is that we do not think it desirable that the Protocol should be allowed to come into operation as a separate instrument side by side with the Covenant of the League. Many of the articles of the Protocol affect the very constitution of the League of Nations. Quite apart from the fact that the Protocol is a complicated instrument, and by no means easy tcr interpret in relation to the Covenant, we think it fundamentally unsound that the constitution of the League should be contained even provisionally in two separate instruments, one of which is adhered to by some nations but not by others.17. We think it possible, however, that it might be convenient to consider any necessary or desirable amendments to the Covenant as a whole, and that this course might facilitate their acceptance by the League and its constituent States. To such extent, therefore, as the proposals contained in the Protocol may be found acceptable and desirable as amendments to the Covenant, we see no objection to their pro-visional incorporation in a Protocol, on the clear understanding that they will not come into operation unless and until they have been embodied as amendments in the Covenant.
PART II.-EXAMINATION OF THE PROTOCOL. Introductory Paragraphs.19. In accordance with the recommendations in paragraphs 16 and 17 of this Report that the Protocol should not exist as a separate document and should consist of amendments to the Covenant, to come into operation only when accepted as such, the Preamble (which has been criticised in the Papers before the Committee of Imperial Defence) and Article 1 in its present form would disappear. We suggest that they might be replaced by an introductory and explanatory article, which might take the following form : &quot; The Signatory States undertake to make every effort to secure the intro-duction into the Covenant of amendments on the lines of the provisions contained in the following articles.&quot;Arbitration.20. We attach to this Report a memorandum showing in detail the difference between the Protocol and the Covenant in the matter of arbitration (Annex I) and bringing out clearly the advance which the Protocol makes on the Covenant in the direction of compulsory arbitration.21. These differences can be exhibited in a more general way by quotations from the General Report submitted to the Fifth Assembly, which contains the official commentary on the Protocol:  &quot; Compulsory arbitration is the fundamental basis of the proposed system. It has seemed to be the only means of attaining the ultimate aim pursued by the League of Nations, viz., the establishment of a pacific and legal order in the relations between peoples.&quot;*M- ^J. Jl, Ji. J .&quot;IP Vv&quot; TP -Jt* &quot;IS-&quot; Henceforth no purely private war between nations will be tolerated.    j &quot; This result is obtained by strengthening the pacific methods of procedure laid down in the Covenant.   The Protocol completes them and extends them to all   international   disputes,   without   exception,   by   making   arbitration compulsory.&quot;-Jfc -it- -tf-&apos;TV &quot;7V TP &quot;TP&quot; In the system of the Protocol, the obligation to submit disputes to arbitration is sound and practical, because it always has a sanction. Its appli-cation is automatically ensured, by means of the intervention of the Council; in no case can it be thrown on one side through the ill-will of one of the disputant States. The awards to which it leads are always accompanied by a sanction, adapted to the circumstances of the case and more or less severe according to the degree of resistance offered to the execution of the sentence.&quot;-A- *n-&quot; Under the Covenant, while the old unlimited right of States to make war is restricted, it is not abolished. \ There are cases in which the exercise of this right is tolerated; some wars are prohibited and others are legitimate.&quot; In future the position will be different. In no case is any State signatory of the Protocol entitled to undertake on its own sole initiative an offensive war against another signatory State or against any non-signatory State which accepts all the obligations assumed by the signatories under the Protocol.&quot;* * * * * *&quot; The general principle of the Protocol could not be accepted unless the pacific settlement of all international disputes without distinction were made possible.- -18. With this preface we will proceed to examine the Protocol in detail in order to ascertain how far its provisions are acceptable or desirable, whether in their original or in an amended form, for incorporation as amendments to the Covenant.
&quot; This solution has been found, in the first place, in the extension of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice.&quot;&apos;-it. -it. jf. Ji. jj. ^i.&quot;7v&quot; TV \  &quot;7f. TV&quot; &quot;TV&quot; &quot;JV&quot;&quot; We have, in the second place, succeeded in making possible the pacific settlement of all disputes by strengthening the procedure laid down in the Covenant.&quot;22. This rigid application of the idea of compulsory arbitration to all disputes is not a novel doctrine. It formed the basis of the plan presented in 1919 to the League of Nations Commission of the Paris peace conference by the French Delega-tion. On that occasion the direct issue of compulsory arbitration was avoided by the adoption, as a basis of discussion, of President Wilson&apos;s draft Covenant, in which compulsory arbitration was avoided. The subject, however, was subsequently alluded to at several meetings of the League of Nations Commission, but was discouraged by the British representatives and thereupon dropped. The principle of compulsory arbitration came up again in 1920, when the Protocol establishing the Permanent Court of International Justice was under consideration. It was again rejected by a unanimous decision of the Cabinet, after an adverse opinion had been obtained from the then Lord Chancellor (Lord Birkenhead) and the Law Officers of the Crown (Sir Gordon Hewart and Sir E. Pollock). As recently as July last the late Lord Chancellor (Lord Haldane) gave an opinion adverse to rendering compulsory the jurisdiction of the International Court.23. The objections to compulsory arbitration, whether by the International Court of Justice or by arbitrators chosen by the Council of the League, are fully set forth in papers prepared for the Committee of Imperial Defence. (Sir Eyre Crowe&apos;s Memorandum, C.I.D. Paper No. 538-B, paragraphs 4 to 11, and annexure thereto, and the Memorandum by Mr. Campbell, C.I.D. Paper No. 540-5, pages 2 to 5). We do not think it necessary to repeat the arguments here. It is sufficient for us to point out that hitherto it has been held that there are grave issues, whether of a general political nature or arising out of disputes on questions of international law or the interpretation of treaties, which do not lend themselves to arbitration, and that this consideration was in the mind of those who framed the Covenant and the Statute of the International Court of Justice. From a study of the proceedings of the 190th and 192nd Meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which have been placed at our disposal, we are encouraged to believe that the same view is held by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that they are not willing to accept in advance and unconditionally the principle of compulsory arbitration, whether by the International Court of Justice or by the Council of the League, in every kind of dispute.24. It is perhaps not generally realised how far the provisions of the Covenant already go in the direction of compulsory arbitration. While we hesitate to recommend their revision, which might shock public opinion, we venture to express a doubt whether they would survive if seriously strained beyond their present scope. In any case, we are convinced that to strengthen them, as proposed in the Protocol, is not in the interest of the British Empire or of the League itself.25. We have considered whether it would be useful, while rejecting the principle of compulsory arbitration, to retain any part of the new procedure of arbitration proposed in the Protocol. Insomuch, however, as it is all designed to lead up to the principle of compulsory arbitration, we have come to the conclusion that this course is impracticable. We therefore recommend that articles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Protocol should be rejected.Suspension of Defensive Measures before and during Proceedings forPacific Settlement.26. There is no part of the Geneva Protocol which is more strongly objected to by the Service Departments than articles 7 and 8. The three Chiefs of Staff, who are responsible for advising oh matters of Imperial Defence, decline to accept a state of arrested activity before and during proceedings for pacific settlement. They point out that, evidently, in drawing up the Protocol, the case of continental Powers has been chiefly considered, with the object of preventing concentrations of troops on land frontiers, and that insufficient attention has been given to the British Empire, which depends for its defence on sea power and the complete freedom of movement of its forces.   The Chiefs of Staff object no less strongly to the undertaking
in article 8 &quot; to abstain from any act which might constitute a threat of aggression.&apos;&apos; The term is so vague that, in their view, some of our essential defensive preparations might be called into question. The Chiefs of Staff go so far as to express the view that the security of the Empire would be threatened by the restrictions in articles 7 and 8 of the Protocol.27. Sir Cecil Hurst considers that the apprehensions of the Fighting Services in regard to the possible interpretation of article 8 are exaggerated, but we feel that imperial defence is so vital that it cannot be allowed to depend on the interpretation of an article in an international convention, and that no risks ought to be taken in this matter.28. We think it would interest the Committee of Imperial Defence to know that a somewhat similar proposal was made during the Paris peace conference, when Baron Makino, a Japanese representative, proposed that from the time a dispute is submitted to arbitration or to enquiry by the Council and until the lapse of the three months after the award (during which Members of the League undertake in article 12 of the Covenant in no case to resort to war) the parties to the dispute should refrain from making any military preparations. This proposal was opposed by several members of the Commission on the League of Nations, including Lord Robert Cecil, who considered, inter alia, that it would &quot;seem to impose obligations too great for human nature, and to put tremendous advantages into the hands of unscrupulous States.&quot; Eventually Baron Makino withdrew his amendment.29. We have considered whether it would be possible to bring the prohibition on military preparations within reasonable limits by the introduction of some qualifying phrase, such as appeared in the definition of &quot;aggression&quot; in the draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance presented to the Fifth Assembly of the League by an American group, and to confine the limitation to measures &quot;not taken for purposes of defence or for the protection of human life.&quot; Any such limitation, however, would introduce a fresh element of uncertainty as to what could legitimately be included under the categories of measures of &quot;defence &quot;or &quot; for the protection of human life,&quot; and we do not recommend this plan.30. We have also considered whether it would be possible to find some general form of words which would give the Council the right to do its best to dissuade States from provocative military preparations while a dispute is under consideration, without hampering the adoption of legitimate and essential defensive precautions. On the whole, however, we think it would be wiser to leave the Council to exercise its discretion in the matter according to the circumstances of the moment, under article 11 of the Covenant: &quot;Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of theMembers of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to thewhole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wiseand effectual to safeguard the peace of nations . . . .&quot;31. The attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence is invited to the last paragraph of article 7 of the Protocol, which provides that decisions in regard to that article can be taken by a two-thirds maj ority. It results that the measures taken by a State might be declared by the Council as an infraction of this article against the opinion of the British representative; if the State resorted to war it would automatically be presumed to be an aggressor under the provisions of article 10, sub-paragraph 2, and the Council would then call upon the signatory States to apply sanctions. Thus the British Empire might be called upon to apply sanctions in respect of an action which, in its inception, had not been deemed by the British representative to be a transgression of the Covenant.32. We are strongly of opinion that it ought not to be possible for the British Empire to be committed to sanctions unless the British representative on the Council lias been a consenting party to the decision of the Council that an infraction of the Covenant involving the imposition of sanctions has taken place.33. We recommend that the whole of articles 7 and 8 be rejected.Demilitarised Zones.34. We do not see any objection to the principle of demilitarised zones as provided for in article 9 of the Protocol, but we think it right to draw attention to rhe view of the three Chiefs of Staff that, while the existence of demilitarised zones
Definition of an Aggressor.38. Subject to considerable amendment, we think that there would be no objection to the incorporation in the Covenant of the definition of an aggressor contained in article 10 of the Protocol. It is true that the main point of this article has been lost owing to the disappearance of the principle of compulsory arbitration. Nevertheless, the article does add something of value to the Covenant, insomuch as it provides for fixing a date on which the obligations of the States to co-operate for the defence of the Covenant enter into force.. 39. We feel strong objection to the second sentence in the article, which provides that &quot; Violation of the rules laid down for a demilitarised zone shall be held equivalent to resort to war.&quot; It is clear that there may be degrees of seriousness in the violation of a demilitarised zone. The violation may be of quite a minor kind or purely technical in character. It is a matter of which the Council should be the judge.  We recommend that the wording of this sentence should be as follows :.-&quot; Violation of the rules laid down for a demilitarised zone may be held by the Council to be equivalent to a resort to war.&quot;40. The avowed object of the Assembly in drafting the second paragraph of article 10 was to secure some means by which the aggressor might be determined automatically. There was a feeling in certain quarters that this determination should not be left entirely to the Council. In our view, however, article 10 would not work out in practice in this way. It is almost impossible to imagine a case of an outbreak of hostilities in which the blame could be apportioned by rule and beyond any shadow of doubt, or one in which all Governments would be unanimous in. attaching the blame in the same quarter. Consequently, we believe that, even under the Protocol, it would, in practice, have been necessary for the Council to make a pronouncement. In any case, we consider that in so vitally important a matter, involving the infliction of sanctions, the British Empire should not be committed [12506] cwill facilitate the naming of the aggressor and may tend to delay aggression, it is extremely doubtful if such zones are calculated to prevent aggression, especially in case of air action.35. We feel bound to draw attention, also, to the second paragraph of article 9, which provides that either existing or future demilitarised zones may, at the request and at the expense of one or more of the coterminous States, be placed under a temporary or permanent supervision to be organised by the Council. The meaning of this paragraph can best be illustrated by applying it to the case of Germany, against whom it is obviously directed. The provision in question would enable either France or Belgium to place the demilitarised zone in the Rhinelands, as established by articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, under the temporary or permanent supervision of the League, and Germany would have no voice in the matter. The French, it is true, maintain that the Council of the League already possesses this right under article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, but the British Government has not accepted this interpretation. The question has been referred for advice to the Law Officers of the Crown, who, we are informed, have reported that &quot; it is not possible under the Treaty of Versailles for the Council of the League to establish the permanent resident organisation which the French Government desire, but that the rights of the Council are confined to the institution of specific investigations carried out from time to time by commissions of enquiry appointed for the purpose.&quot;36. Apart from the Treaty of Versailles, however, we think that in its present form this paragraph is objectionable and calculated to deter nations from adopting the principle of demilitarised zones. We ourselves might think twice about adopting a demilitarised zone (say) on the frontiers of India or in Africa, if we knew that the British portion of the zone was liable to be placed under a permanent or even temporary supervision organised by the Council without our consent.37. We recommend, therefore, that words should be inserted to make this provision subject to the consent of the State in which the demilitarised zone is situated (see article 2 of Annex II). In making this recommendation, however, we feel it necessary to mention that the proposed amendment would probably be opposed by the French Government.
except by an expressed declaration of the Council. We therefore feel that, despite all the objections which have been raised to the principle that decision must rest with the Council acting unanimously, with the exception of the parties to the dispute, no other provision can safely be accepted by the Empire. Sub-paragraph 2 of article 10 will have to be omitted, as it refers solely to article 7 of the Protocol, the rejection of which has been recommended in paragraph 33 of this Report. Some other minor consequential alterations will also be necessary.41. The amended definition of an aggressor, to which we think no objection need be taken as an amendment to the Covenant, would be as follows : &quot; For the purposes of the Covenant, any Member of the League which resorts to war, in violation of the undertakings contained in the Covenant, is designated an aggressor. Whether the Member resorting to war has, in fact, in so doing violated those undertakings, is a question to be determined by the Council acting unanimously, with the exception of the parties to the dispute.&quot; Violation of the rules laid down for a demilitarised zone may be held by the Council to be equivalent to a resort to war.&quot;The Proposed Armistice.42. We desire at this point to draw attention to the provisions in the third paragraph of article 10, whereby, if the Council does not at once succeed in determining the aggressor, it shall be bound to enjoin upon the belligerents an armistice, shall fix the terms, acting, if need be, by a two-thirds majority, and shall supervise its execution. The Chiefs of Staff point out the difficulties of imposing an armistice on belligerents once hostilities have broken out, and state that an armistice, unless set up with the consent of both parties, is useless. . We have discussed the matter with the representatives of the Fighting Services, and we agree with them that the difficulties of imposing an armistice are in many cases likely to be overwhelming. We also discussed with them the possibility of substituting some-thing less than an armistice, such as a mere cessation of fighting. They have convinced us, however, that this is impracticable. The moment an attempt is made to stop fighting, all sorts of subsidiary questions must inevitably be settled pro-visionally at the same time, such as. the procedure in regard to reinforcements or supplies on their way by sea, land or air; movement of forces in general, as also of supplies, both for the armies and the civil population; aerial reconnaissance, and many other matters, which will vary in each case.43. Apart from its impracticability, this part of article 10 is open to strong objection on the ground that the Council, in fixing the terms of the armistice, can act by a two-thirds majority. A nation which refuses to accept the armistice or violates its terms becomes an aggressor, and the Council thereupon calls upon the Signatory States to apply sanctions. Suppose, for example, that in a given case the British representative demurs to the terms of a proposed armistice on the ground that they are oppressive, impracticable, and must only lead to a continuance of hostilities. The Council overrules him and imposes the armistice by a two-thirds majority. The expected happens and hostilities break out. The Council is then bound to call for sanctions. In effect, therefore, the decision to impose sanctions will have been taken in respect of an action which in its inception had not been deemed by the British representative on the Council to be a breach of the Protocol.44. We have already expressed a strong view that the British Empire should not in any circumstances agree to be committed to sanctions, unless our representa-tive on the Council has been a consenting party to the decision of the Council that an infraction of the Covenant involving the imposition of sanctions has taken place.45. We think, however, that these objections could be met by substituting for the paragraphs dealing with an armistice the following : &quot;If the Council is unable to arrive at any such determination, it shall use its best efforts to persuade the parties to agree to an armistice. Any belligerent which, after accepting such an armistice, wilfully violates its terms shall be deemed an aggressor.&quot;We consider that the proper place for the inclusion of this paragraph would be immediately following the first paragraph of the amended definition of an aggressor contained in paragraph 41, and we have accordingly placed it in that position in our revised article 3 of Annex II.
Economic Sanctions.46. We have discussed the financial aspects of the Protocol with Sir O. Niemeyer and the economic aspects with Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith, to whom we are indebted for a large number of suggestions. Both are in agreement with our recommendations in these respects.47. The first paragraph of article 11 of the Protocol refers the reader to the obligations of the States in regard to the sanctions of all kinds mentioned in paragraphs 1 .and 2 of article 16 of the Covenant. We desire to call attention to these obligations before we discuss article 11 of the Protocol. They are as follows: -&apos;&apos; Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, *the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial, or personal intercourse between the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not.*&quot;It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.&quot;(The italics are not in the original.)48. If the words here printed in italics are studied, it will be seen that, in the event of an aggression, we should have the obligation of preventing all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the State against whom the sanctions were directed, and those of a nation like the United States of America, which is not a member of the League.49. We consider that this is a position fraught with the gravest danger, especially for a maritime State, which it is most desirable to bring to an end. We are informed that in 1920, when it became clear that the United States of America had no intention of becoming a member of the League, attention was drawn departmentally in the Foreign Office to the serious, position created by article 16, and the suggestion was made that the Covenant should be denounced. The proposal does not seem to have been referred to the Cabinet. We consider, however, that there should be no further hesitation in taking up this matter. A situation by which we are liable at any moment to find ourselves in a position of being bound on behalf of the League to interrupt financial, commercial and personal relations between citizens of the United States and those of some other country ought not to be prolonged.50. The provisions of article 16 of the Covenant are also open to serious criticism on other grounds. They insist on the complete severance in all cases of all trade or financial relations, leaving no discretion either to the States or to the Council to select the most appropriate measures to be taken in any particular case, or to temper by means of licence the inevitable hardships to persons and commerce which (as the experience of the late War amply shows) are certain to arise under a system of indiscriminate prohibition. The revised text which we propose below (see paragraph 61) for articles 11 and 12 of the Protocol provides, we* At the recent meeting of the Assembly an amendment was adopted in favour of substituting the following words: &quot; and to prohibit all intercourse at least between persons resident within their territories and persons resident, -within the territory of the Covenant-breaking State, and, if they deem it expedient, also between their nationals and the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State, and to prevent all financial, commercial or personal intercourse at least between persons resident within the territory of that State and persons resident within the territory of any other State, whether a member of the League or not, and, if they deem it expedient, also between the nationals of that State and the nationals of any other State, whether a member of the League or not.&quot;This amendment, which has not yet been ratified, dees not substantially affect the argument in paragraphs 48 to 51, inclusive, of this Report.[12506] c 2
think, the necessary elasticity, but if that text were embodied in the Covenant, consequential modifications would be necessary in article 16 of the Covenant to bring it into harmony with the new article. The following is a tentative redraft of paragraph 1 of article 16 of the Covenant which coupled with the articles of the Revised Draft Protocol which we propose in Annex II, would, we think, meet the case : &quot; The Members of the League agree that an aggressor shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, and shall be immediately liable to the severance of all trade or financial relations, and to the prohibition of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between its nationals or persons resident within its territories and the nationals of&quot; the other Miembers of the League or persons resident within their territories.&quot;The remaining paragraphs of article 16 do not appear to us to require any alteration of substance, though, no doubt, when the articles of the Revised Draft Protocol come to be fitted into the framework of the Covenant a certain amount of rearrangement of paragraphs will be necessary. We contemplate provisionally that the revised article 16 of the Covenant should follow our article 3 and immediately precede our article 4 (see Annex II).51. While the modifications here suggested would largely reduce the dangerous risks which would attend the literal enforcement of the provisions of article 16 of the Covenant as they stand, we are bound to point out that they would leave untouched, or might even accentuate, another difficulty to which the Board of Trade attach importance. We are advised that, unless the United States were a party to the enforcement of the sanctions, there is a considerable probability that these sanctions would fail if directed against a powerful and stubborn aggressor possessing maritime ports. The point is dealt with in detail in the Memorandum (C.I.D. Paper No. 536-B) circulated by the President of the Board of Trade. This risk of failure is pro tanto increased by the amendments which we propose, which, in various ways, tend to mitigate the severity of the pressure which could be applied. Now the fear that the sanctions may be successfully defied, and that consequently no guarantees will be obtainable against future reprisals and proceedings for breach of contract, would, we think, add seriously to the alarm with which the compulsory severance of trade relations would be viewed by commercial and financial interests. As we can see no way of overcoming this difficulty, short of obtaining the co-operation of the United States, it is the more necessary to avoid placing fresh difficulties in the way of the accession of that Government.52. Apart from the above criticism of article 16 of the Covenant, the proposals for the application of sanctions, as set forth in articles 10 (last paragraph), and 11 to 13 of the Protocol, are-open to many objections. The Admiralty representatives, for example, have pointed out an important advance, as compared with the Covenant, which is &quot;made in the first paragraph of article 11 of the Protocol. For this paragraph appears to provide that the sanctions mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 16 of the Covenant shall come into operation automatically immediately the Council calls upon the Signatory States to apply sanctions, whereas by article 16 of the Covenant the automatic sanctions are confined to the financial and economic measures in paragraph 1, and the military, naval and air sanctions require a recommendation of the Council. In his comment on article 11 of the Protocol, the rapporteur of the Assembly, M. Benes, observed that &quot; This decision implies that such sanctions as the case requires economic, financial, military, naval and air shall be applied forthwith, and without further recommendations or decisions.&quot; .,On the other hand, Sir Cecil Hurst has assured us that the intention was that the naval, military and air sanctions in the second paragraph of article 16 of the Covenant, even when brought into force by the first paragraph of article 11 of the Protocol, would still require a recommendation by the Council. If this be the case, however, we fail to see why the paragraph was introduced, for it makes little, if any, change from the Covenant. The paragraph appears to us objectionable if it is meant to provide for an advance on the Covenant, and superfluous if it does not.
53. The words at the end of the second paragraph of article 11 of the Protocol, which provide that the obligation of a State to take sanctions is to be interpreted&apos;&apos; in the degree which its geographical position and its particular situation as regards armaments allow/&apos;are also open to objection. We are informed that this limitation was introduced to meet the exigencies of a State such as Denmark, which has decided to abolish its defensive forces and cannot give any effective naval, military or air co-operation. We do not think that such an attitude ought to be encouraged. To such extent as States abolish their defensive armaments, they tend to throw increased responsibilities on the other States Members of the League. If a State enjoys the protection of the League it should also incur proportionate liability.54. The third paragraph of article 11 of the Protocol has been criticised by the Service Departments as adding to our commitments, more particularly in respect of the undertaking by Signatory States to take all measures in their power to preserve the safety of communications of a threatened State. The text of the paragraph is as fohows : &quot; In accordance with paragraph 3 of article 16 of the Covenant, the Signatory States give a joint and several undertaking to come to the assistance of the State attacked or threatened, and to give each other mutual support by means of facilities and reciprocal exchanges as regards the provision of raw materials and supplies of every kind, openings of credits, transport and transit, and for this purpose to take all measures in their power to preserve the safety of communications by land and by sea of the attacked or threatened State.&quot;55. The precise intention of this clause has, we believe, been misunderstood in some degree by its critics. The whole paragraph is governed by the opening words, &quot; In accordance with paragraph 3 of article 16 of the Covenant,&quot; which (except as regards the passage of the forces of the League&apos;s members through territory) is confined to financial and economic measures. We are assured by Sir Cecil Hurst that this part of article 11 was intended to be limited to the carrying out of economic measures in support of a State which would otherwise suffer by taking action prescribed by the League. Sir Cecil Hurst, for purposes of illustration, recalled that, when countries like Denmark were forced by the economic pressure of the Allies during the Great War to curtail their exports to Germany, the Allies had to make good to the Danes the goods which were normally furnished to them by Germany, and of which Germany had cut off the supply as a measure of retaliation. The purpose of the clause, therefore, is to ensure that States carrying out the behest of the League shall be recouped by means, not only of supplies, credits, transport and transit facilities, but also by measures to secure the safety of their sea and land communications.56. The Admiralty representatives point out, however, that even with this interpretation the clause might in certain cases involve a considerable naval commit-ment. If we are to carry out our obligation &quot;to preserve the safety of communications&quot; loyally and effectively against an aggressor (and presumably an aggressive) State, it is not very material whether it is for an economic or a military reason. The criticism in the following Admiralty letter of the 20th September, addressed to the Foreign Office, will still apply : &quot; To ensure the sea communications of a threatened State entails the use of a naval force for the purpose of preventing the aggressor State from interfering with the seaborne commerce of her opponent under whatever flag it may be carried.&quot; To be effective, this force must operate within reach of the naval forces of the aggressor State, and will be open to attack by the naval forces of the aggressor State at any moment.&quot; My Lords cannot protest too strongly against the British fleet being placed in such a dangerous and humiliating position.&quot;57. The British Delegate in his speech to the Third Committee of the Assembly on the 22nd September, 1924, stated that &quot; we are undertaking no new obligations &quot; in article 11.   If this is the case, we think it would be better to dispense with the
article altogether. If, however, as we believe, new obligations are involved, we consider them objectionable, and that they should be eliminated. Consequently, if this paragraph had to be retained in any form (which we do not recommend see below, paragraph 61), the following words would have to be omitted : Ci and for this purpose to take all measures in their power to preserve the safety of communications by land and by sea of the threatened State.&quot;58. Article 12 of the Protocol is also open to considerable objection. From the time of the Paris peace conference onwards the French Government has always desired to see the League of Nations equipped with a General Staff, which would draw up plans of operations for the forces of the League. Article 12 of the Protocol is an adaptation of this idea to the economic and financial sphere. The first part of the article proposes to refer forthwith to the economic and financial organisations of the League the task of considering and reporting as to the nature of the steps to be taken to give effect to the financial and economic sanctions and measures it co-operation contemplated in article 16 of the Covenant and in article 11 of the Protocol. The second part of the article contemplates that on the basis of the above information the Council of the League shall draw up &quot; plans of action for the application of the economic and financial sanctions against an aggressor State,&quot; as well as plans of co-operation.59. The second of the above proposals is tantamount to constituting the economic and financial organs of the League into an economic and financial section of a General Staff. While we think that the economic and financial organisation might be permitted to make a preliminary study of the general character of the measures for giving effect to economic and financial sanctions, we regard the drawing up of &quot; plans of action&apos;&quot; directed against a particular State as an absurdity. By the last sentence of the article the plans are to be communicated to the members of the League and other Signatory States. If the &quot; plans &quot; are thus to be made public property, means will be found by a State or group of States contemplating an aggression, to evade them,60. In reviewing the difficulties arising out of the provisions of the Protocol which deal with the automatic application of the economic sanctions, we have found ourselves at every turn faced with the fact that those difficulties are, generally speaking, really inherent in the Covenant. We have expressed the opinion that in this respect the Covenant calls for amendment, not however in the direction in which the protocol seeks to amend it by strengthening its provisions, but in the opposite direction of restricting their scope and stringency. We believe that an unexpectedly favourable opportunity to effect such desired amendment is offered byx a general revision of the Protocol such as we are now considering. If, as we hope, a strong case can be presented to the League in favour of such general revision, suggestions for weakening rather than strengthening particular clauses of the Covenant may very possibly be listened to with less suspicion and hostility if they form part of a comprehensive scheme for producing a generally acceptable Protocol, to&apos; be subse-quently embodied in the Covenant, than would be likely to be the case if an isolated proposal were put forward for simply watering down the commitments in regard to the automatic application of the sanctions.61. After very careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that there would be some advantage in substituting for articles 10 (last paragraph), 11 and 12 of the Protocol, the following articles as the basis of amendments of the Covenant : -&quot; The Council shall notify forthwith to the Members of the League that a State is an aggressor, and such notification shall be conclusive until it is revoked or until the state of war which gave rise to the notification of the aggression is terminated.The Members of the League agree that, as from the date on which they receive a notification from the Council that one or more Member States are aggressors, every Member State not declared an aggressor is bound, so far as its rights and powers extend, to co-operate loyally and effectively in support of the Covenant of the League of Nations and in resistance to the aggression, by means of such measures of the kind contemplated in article 16 of the Covenant as are best suited to the circumstances of the particular case, and any Member State shall for the purpose of such action be entitled to exercise the rights of a belligerent.Substitute for article 10 (last paragraph).Substitute for article 11.(Article 11 amended.)
Wlien the event contemplated in the preceding article has arisen^ the Council may, if it thinks fit, make recommendations from time to time, for the consideration of the various Govern-ments concerned, as to the economic and financial measures of the kind contemplated in article 16 of the Covenant, which it deems best suited in the circumstances to bring the aggression to an end. It is, however, clearly understood that the obligations of the Mem-bers of the League with regard to such measures under the preceding article of this Protocol are in no way suspended or diminished, pending the receipt of any such recommendations.In preparation for the eventual exercise of its powers under this article, the Council may, from time to time, invite the economic and financial organisations of the League to study the general character of the measures which might be proposed in order to give effect, within the limits of the rights and powers of the States, to the provisions of the Covenant relating to economic and financial sanctions and measures of mutual co-operation.&quot;We must point out that any measures for the application of economic sanctions would require legislation.Military Sanctions and Regional Agreements.62. Article 13 of the Protocol contains provisions which go far in the direction of carrying into the sphere of military sanctions the same general idea as article 12 does in that of economic and financial sanctions, though, in the former case, this idea is not pursued so far as to suggest the drawing up of plans.63. The first paragraph of the article stipulates that, in view of the contingent military, naval and air sanctions provided for in the Covenant and Protocol, the Council &quot; shall be entitled to receive undertakings from States determining in advance the military, naval and air forces which they would be able to bring into action immediately . . . .&quot;; and the second paragraph of the article refers to agreements which States &quot;may previously have concluded&quot; to bring to the assistance of a particular State, which is the victim of aggression, their military, naval and air forces, which agreements are to be registered and published by the League Secretariat.64. It is not clear what the Council of the League is to do with this information, which might become large in volume if States availed themselves to any considerable extent of the right to offer undertakings of forces to the Council. If the information were to be kept up to date, co-ordinated, and ready for application to particular emergencies, the Council would require something in the nature of an Intelligence Department. The creation of an Intelligence Department might be a first step towards that of a General Staff.65. We also feel bound to invite attention to the idea of regional agreements, which as mentioned above are provided for in the second paragraph of article 13.66. A good deal of misgiving on the subject of regional agreements was felt at the Paris peace conference in 1919, and doubts were expressed whether they are consistent with the spirit of the Covenant.   As pointed out by M. Orlando : &quot; A State which had concluded special Conventions with another State might some time find itself obliged to take part in a war which the League of Nations was conducting against that State, and so there would be a conflict between its general obligation towards the League of Nations and its particular obligation to an individual State.&quot;It was contended that defensive alliances were unobjectionable, but to this the rejoinder was made that all alliances are defensive in their inception. The general result of the discussions on the subject at the League of Nations Commission of the Peace Conference seems to have been to leave the matter to the Council. As the alliances would have to be registered by the League, the Council would have an opportunity to object if they were incompatible with the Covenant. The proposal in article 13 of the Protocol is not inconsistent with this view.67. The plan of regional agreements formed part of the draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance and was definitely rejected by the late Government, on the ground that the conclusion of such treaties by one group of States is likely to bring about theSubstitutetfoi-article 12.(Article 12, paragraph 2 amended.)
formation of competing groups, and that the result will be the reappearance of the pre-war system of alliances and counter-alliances (Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&quot; s despatch of the 5th July, 1924).68. The plan in article 13 of the Protocol of making the agreements open to all States Members of the League which may desire to accede to them, gives an appearance of harmlessness, but somewhat lacks reality. For example, the accession of Germany to a Franco-Belgian-Czechoslovak-Polish combination would not alter its real intention. The matter is one of high policy, which the Cabinet can alone decide.  We refrain from making any recommendation.69. We feel that any amendment to the Covenant on the lines of article 13 of the Protocol should not go beyond providing for an intimation to the Council as to the specific contingencies in which States would be prepared to make their maximum effort to oppose acts of aggression.  We suggest the following draftarticle: , n/ &apos; v    j I,      ;     .., -      ;, - . . -    -  -; &apos;       :&apos;(Alternative to ;/ &quot; In view of the contingent military, naval and air sanctions article 13.) provided for by Article 16 of the Covenant, Members of the Leaguemay intimate to the Council the specific contingencies in which they ,, will be prepared to make their maximum military, naval and air / effort to oppose possible acts of aggression.&apos;&apos; Any agreement mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be published by the Secretariat of the League of Nations.&quot;70. The expediency of including the above article as an amendment of the Covenant depends to some extent upon the attitude the Government propose to adopt towards French and Belgian security, a subject with which we deal later in Part III of this Report.The Cessation of Sanctions.71. Article 14 of the Protocol provides that the Council shall alone be competent to declare that the application of sanctions shall cease and normal conditions be re-established. We are informed that this provision was made for the same reason as the Treaty of London of the 5th September, 1914, wherein the Allies in the late war agreed that none of them would make a separate peace. .72. We feel, however, that there is a fundamental difference between a Treaty between a limited number of nations applicable to a particular war and an under-taking for all future wars and sanctions which may be undertaken by the League. In the case of the Great War we were always in a position to exercise a great influence on our allies. In the case of the League of Nations a unanimous decision by. the Council would be required before sanctions could be lifted, and a single nation or group of nations, by refusing assent, might postpone the date indefinitely and compel us to maintain a blockade. In the words of the Chiefs of Staff, &quot; a Government may find itself compelled to carry out a policy in opposition to public opinion.&quot;73. On the other hand, we are advised that it is essential that some date should be fixed at which normal relations will be restored. Otherwise great confusion will result in the commercial and financial world.74. We suggest the following draft as the basis of an amendment to the Covenant:  (Alternative to &quot; The measures provided for in article 16 of the Covenantarticle 14) may legally be applied by Members of the League until such time asthe Council shall declare that the state of war which gave rise to the notification of aggression is terminated.&apos;&apos; k75. Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith has urged upon us the importance of drawing up some rules regarding the revival of contracts between nationals of the States concerned, the performance of which was interrupted by the sanctions, and the barring of legal proceedings for damage caused by such interruptions. We appreciate the importance of making some such provision, since, in its absence, great confusion is likely to arise and economic and financial sanctions are likely to be rendered even more objectionable to the business world than they would otherwise be. The matter, however, is highly technical, and, as it does not affect the constitution of the League but only procedure, we think that the objections given in paragraph 16 of this Report would not apply, and that it would suffice for the moment to include as an amendment
to the Covenant provision for making a separate agreement on the subject. We suggest the following article as the basis of an amendment to the Covenant : &quot; The Signatory States agree that, in view of the uncertainty and confusion that would otherwise arise on the restoration of normal relations, especially as to the position of contracts, they will come to a general understanding on this subject as soon as possible by means of a supplementary agreement.&quot; This agreement shall be based on the general principle that, unless otherwise agreed between the parties, contracts, the performance of which was interrupted by the sanctions, shall be revived, wherever practicable, subject to necessary modifications of dates, and that no claims shall arise from action legally taken in pursuance of the Covenant, except that the aggressor may be required in certain circumstances to compensate the Signatory States or their nationals.&quot;76. We include as Annex III a draft which might serve as a basis of discussion for a supplementary agreement of the kind contemplated in the two preceding paragraphs.Reparation and Costs of Sanctions.77. The first paragraph of article 15 of the Protocol provides for the payment by an aggressor of the costs of naval, military and air operations undertaken as sanctions, as well as reparation for all losses suffered by individuals, whether civilians or combatants, and for material damage caused by the operations of both sides.78. We recognise that there is something to be said in favour of a provision of this kind as an additional deterrent to a State not to become an aggressor. If any provision of the kind were adopted, however, we think the amount and manner of the payment should be left to the Council to decide. Having regard to our experience of the overwhelming difficulty in extracting reparation without upsetting the whole economic system of the world, we feel confident that the Governments of the Empire will hesitate before committing themselves to the principle of the recovery of the costs of the war and reparation in all future cases in which the League may be constrained to apply sanctions. The matter is one for settlement as part of the terms of peace, and each case will have to be dealt with on its merits.79. We recommend that the first paragraph of article 15 should be rejected.Maintenance of Territorial Integrity.80. We are also confident that the Government will not wish to endorse the proposal in the second part of article 15 of the Protocol, that neither the territorial integrity nor the political independence of the aggressor State shall in any case be affected as the result of the application of sanctions. It is obvious that cases might arise eg., the systematic ill-treatment or extermination of minorities where it i would be essential to take action affecting the territorial or political independence of a State. This, again, is an instance where each case must be considered on its merits, having regard, of course, to article 10 of the Covenant and all relevant circumstances.81. We recommend, therefore, that the whole of article 15 should be rejected.Disputes with Nations Outside the League.82. Article 16 of the Protocol is another thoroughly unsatisfactory clause. It provides that, in a dispute between a signatory of the Protocol and a State which has mot signed the Protocol and is not a Member of the League, the latter shall be invited to adhere ad hoc to the Protocol, and that, if it refuses, the sanctions of the Covenant and Protocol shall be applied to it. That is to say, in the event of a dispute between a Central or South American State/ which had signed the Protocol, and the United, States of America, if the latter declined to adhere to the Protocol ad hoc, we should be compelled to apply sanctions to \that country.83. The complications of possible disputes between nations which are both Members of the League and signatories of the Protocol, States which are neither, States which are Members of the League but not signatories of the Protocol, and. States which are. signatories of the Protocol but not Members of the League, are so baffling as to defy systematisation. All this is a strong confirmation of the view expressed earlier in this Report (paragraph 16) that no changes of the kind contem-plated in the Protocol should become operative unless and until they have been incorporated in the Covenant of. the League of Nations. The adoption of this, recommendation renders article 16 of the Protocol unnecessary.[12506] .- d
The Proposed Conference for the Reduction of Armaments. .84. We are not convinced that so complicated an instrument as the Geneva Protocol is required in order to pave the way to some further limitation of armaments if otherwise feasible. The Washington Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament, which appeared before the Conference to present almost insurmountable difficulties on the political side, was based on far simpler political agreements.85. We are far from confident that, even if the Protocol were generally accepted, it would do much towards finding a basis for limiting land, armaments. The basis of such limitation proposed by the British Delegation at the Paris peace conference, namely, voluntary military service, was adopted in the case of all the ex-enemy countries (except Turkey), but was expunged from the first draft of article 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations as presented by President Wilson. No one has yet succeeded in devising an alternative technical basis for the reduction of land armaments. Moreover, the Committee of Imperial Defence ought not to overlook the tendency in many countries to-day to prepare schemes for mobilising the whole of the resources of the nation, civil as well as military, for the contingency of war. The matter is dealt with in the Report of the Co-ordination Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. W. 7), where it is shown that the United States of America, France and Italy are organising on these lines. Even if it is found possible to achieve some reduction in effectives and armaments by international agreement, the schemes of national mobilisation and expansion will be continued; that is to say, the competition in armaments will merely be transferred from one phase of preparation to another.86. We feel convinced that acceptance of the Geneva Protocol would be too high a price to pay for any reduction in armaments which is at all likely to result therefrom. We recognise, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not wish to incur the odium of postponing the proposed Conference sine die by rejecting the Protocol, which was to have formed its political basis. Articles 17 and 21 of the Protocol provide for the summoning of an International Conference on the Reduction of Armaments, and the detailed stipulations in these articles ensure the interdepen-dence of the Protocol and disarmament. The amended form which we propose to give to the Protocol necessarily eliminates those articles, and thereby the disarmament conference ceases to depend on the adoption of the Protocol. In advocating this course His Majesty&apos;s Government may be exposing themselves to the reproach that they are obstructing reduction of armaments. This is of course not the intention. We have not considered ourselves authorised to make any recommendations as to how His Majesty&apos;s Government should proceed in order to make it clear that their attitude towards this problem remains unchanged. His Majesty&apos;s Government may perhaps desire to dwell on the fact that by adopting the provision whichvwe suggest in Part III of this Report for offering supplementary guarantees for security, they will afford fresh justification for approaching in a practical way the question of reduction of armaments.87. Before leaving the subject of the proposed League Conference on the Reduction of Armaments, we feel bound to draw attention to a point of considerable importance, which should be borne in mind, if and when that conference takes place. Paragraph 4 &quot;of article 8 of the Covenant provides that, after the League plan of reduction has been adopted, &apos;&apos; the limits of armaments therein fixed shall not be exceeded without the concurrence of the Council.&quot; This would apparently prevent the expansion of armaments even in time of war.Miscellaneous Observations.88. We do not propose to comment in detail on the remaining articles of the Protocol, which are to a considerable extent complementary in character. There are, however, two points to which we should like to draw attention.89. The first is article 18 of the Protocol, which repeats the corresponding provision in article 15 of the Covenant, that the votes of the representatives of the parties to a dispute shall not be counted when reckoning unanimity or the necessary majority. It will be observed that, in the event of a dispute in which several of the larger nations were involved (e.g., a dispute between Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Belgium on the one hand, and Germany on the other), the decision would be left to the representatives on the Council of two or three of the minor Powers. The formation of regional agreements would tend to accentuate this difficulty. This is a serious defect in the case of the Covenant, but even more serious in that of the Protocol, with its increased authority for the Council.
90. The other point to which we desire to draw attention is the absence from the Protocol of any provision for withdrawal, such as is allowed for in article 1 of the Covenant. Although it is clear from article 1 of the Protocol that the intention is to embody its provisions in the Covenant, it is evident that the attempt might fail and that the two instruments might exist side by side for years. We think, therefore, that if there was any question of Great Britain becoming a signatory of a Protocol, even in some amended form, which were to come into operation as a separate instrument, it should contain a provision for withdrawal. The recommendations, however, contained in paragraphs 16 and 17 render this unnecessary.PART III. FRENCH AND BELGIAN SECURITY.91. In our review of the Geneva Protocol we have proposed the rejection of no less than nine (articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15 and 16) out of sixteen operative articles, as well as the drastic amendment of the remainder (Preamble, and articles 1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14). We have recommended that even as revised these latter articles should only be approved as amendments to the Covenant, and should not come into operation until they are accepted as such.92. We have felt bound to recommend the rejection of many of the new features of the Protocol, including compulsory arbitration, suspension of military preparations during proceedings for pacific settlement, the drawing upof plans for financial and economic sanctions, provision for reparation and costs of the war and the maintenance of territorial integrity. We have also suggested an important alteration in article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which tends to restrict the scope of financial and economic sanctions, instead of extending it as contemplated in the Protocol.93. These recommendations make such fundamental changes in the. character of the Protocol that it is no longer likely to be regarded as of any value from the point of view of French and Belgian security. Furthermore, the adoption of amend-ments to the Covenant based on our recommendations is likely to occupy a long time, so that, if the proposed conference on armaments is to take place without a long delay, some other basis for its deliberations will have to be found.94. In Part I of this Report we pointed out the close connection between French and Belgian Security and reduction of armaments. Our examination of the Protocol has strengthened our conviction of the importance of this connection. Nearly all, if not all, the provisions of the Protocol to which the Government Departments have raised objections were intended to promote- French security, which is possibly now the most important question affecting the peace of Europe.95. Hence, while we recognise that the question is one of the highest State policy which the Cabinet is alone competent to judge, we feel bound to draw attention to the only alternative to the Protocol which is likely to offer any satisfaction to France, namely, some kind of Anglo-French pact of guarantee. As already mentioned, France has made it clear, even since the meeting of the Fifth Assembly at Geneva, that in any event she will not be content with the Protocol and will expect a pact in addition. We think it possible that a guarantee pact might offer her some compensation for the loss of the Protocol. After our examination of the&apos; Protocol, with its hampering restrictions and vague commitments, we think that of the two alternatives a pact is the less objectionable, insomuch as the obligations incurred would be more definite and more clearly within our own Control.96. In case the Committee of Imperial Defence, to whom the Foreign Office have referred the question of French and Belgian security (C.I.D. Paper No. 513-B), wish to examine this tentative suggestion further, we submit the following draft of an instrument, which we think France and Belgium might be persuaded to accept as a sufficient guarantee on our part for their security against an unprovoked&quot; Draft Declaration.&quot; The British, French, and Belgian Governments, &amp;c, declare that the maintenance of the independence and integrity of their territories bordering on the North Sea and the English Channel constitute a vital interest of their respective countries.&quot;2.&quot;Consequently, the three Powers, having especial regard to the close propinquity of their  respective coasts  and  harbours to each other,   and
recognising that any infringement of the territorial status quo in their respective countries cannot but gravely affect their national safety, have resolved to notify, and hereby undertake to notify, the Council of the League of Nations, in pursuance of the provisions of article* of the Covenant, that any unprovoked aggression threatening the said independence and integrity will be regarded by them as one of the contingencies in which they are determined to make their maximum effort by sea, by land, and by air, to oppose and defeat the aggressor.&quot;97. The above draft takes the form of a joint Declaration to be signed by Trance, Belgium and ourselves. It rests on the assumption that we are, in fact, prepared to fight if France or Belgium are in danger o&apos;f seeing their Channel and North Sea ports pass into the possession or control of another Power.98. We have not failed to give special attention to the question whether a pact of this kind could not be so framed as to embrace Germany. This is an idea which has more than once been mooted in informal discussions between the British and French Governments. It has even been introduced into official French communications such as M. Herriofs note of the 11th August. It has also from time to time been ventilated in Germany, where the opinion has been expressed that France and Germany might mutually agree to respect and to&apos; guarantee their common frontier. It must not, however, be overlooked that in French eyes the problem of security from German attack covers a wider field than the Franco-German frontier. It extends over the whole territorial edifice erected by the Treaty of Versailles, with the notable inclusion of Germany&apos;s eastern frontiers; in other words, the maintenance and integrity of Poland and Czecho-Slovakia as against aggression by Germany, with or without Russian complicity or co-operation. The French Government, therefore, after the plan of a pact of guarantee with Great Britain and the United States had come to nought, have consistently endeavoured, in their efforts to substitute a purely Franco-British pact, to provide also for the danger of German aggression against Poland and Czecho-Slovakia.99. His Majesty&apos;s Government have as steadily declined to commit themselves to treating such a contingency specifically as a casus fcederis, still less a casus belli. Their position has been to look upon this particular danger as a matter concerning the League of Nations as a whole and not primarily or mainly Great Britain.100. If we wished to include Germany in a pact on the basis of a reciprocal guarantee of the territories of each of the signatory States, this would necessarily involve an undertaking on our part to defend with British forces the territorial status quo on Germany &apos;s eastern frontier. We should become involved in possible wars arising not only out of disputes between Germany and Poland with Lithuania or Czecho-Slovakia, but also out of a possible Russian attack on Germany. It is for this reason that the form of declaration we propose is limited to provisions for the defence of the territories of those States within whose borders lie the ports and waters in close proximity to England. Nevertheless, this form of pact will be found to allow of bringing Germany into the orbit of a wider and more comprehensive-understanding, in as much as the same form of pact could readily be adapted to other separate declarations on similar lines, to be signed by other Powers, among them Germany, either covering more or less the same ground, or meeting analogous contingencies.101. The Declaration presupposes that the modification proposed in article 13 of the original Protocol (paragraph 69), which originates from a proposal made to us by Generalthe Earl of Cavan, is adopted. While we recognise that a pact of the kind raises the question of regional agreements (referred to in paragraphs 65 to 68 of this Report) in an extreme form, nevertheless, the following advantages may be claimed for such a Declaration :-(1.) It goes as far as we can possibly ask the Dominions and India to assent to-in .the direction of meeting French and Belgian anxieties for security.(2.) It practically offers all that France would have obtained under the Guarantee Treaty of 1919, except for the elimination of the United . States guarantee.(3.) It justifies the preservation (in the form of amendments to the Covenant) &apos;  of parts of the Geneva Protocol, however much truncated and drastically amended, inasmuch as the revised article 13 is given a scope which gains* This Article to be based on Article 7 of the revised Protocol in Annex II.
its full significance by the importance of the specific engagement into which we are prepared to enter thereunder.(4.) Our undertaking is made a piece of the League machinery, not, in form, departing very materially from what the authors of the Protocol put forward as giving effect to Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s ideas.(5.) The Declaration may, as already explained, serve as a model for others on similar lines by members of the League disposed to adopt the same policy in regard to other, or even the same, territories. Germany might do so. Possibly other countries might eventually see their way to enter the same path. In any event, there is nothing in the Declaration to prevent its becoming a fruitful precedent.The proposed declaration will require to be discussed in all its bearings with the Dominions and India before His Majesty&apos;s Government commit themselves in any way.PART IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.102. The rejection of so substantial a part of the Protocol as we have suggested would at first sight appear to render useless any effort to preserve what is left, and this was indeed a conclusion to which we felt we were being driven by purely logical considerations. Another view, however, deserves attention. Among the amendments to the Covenant and Protocol, which we have suggested, there are outstanding two to which we venture to attribute special importance.103. One is the proposal, referred to in paragraphs 49 and 50 above, for a revision of the clause in article 16 of the Covenant respecting the automatic application of the economic sanctions. We have called attention to the importance, nay the necessity, of toning down that clause, and we have the assurance of Sir H. Llewellyn Smith that in the attenuated form given, in our amended version of the corresponding article of the Protocol, to the obligations to apply economic sanctions, the dangerous risks which this country would run if seriously called upon to act on the strict letter of article 16 of the Covenant, especially in our relations with the United States, would be largely obviated, though so long as the United States stands outside the League there would remain a serious chance of failure of the sanctions, with the undesirable consequences to which we have already drawn attention.104. If we are right in believing that to attain the object of carrying such an amendment of the Covenant would be an extremely difficult task, if proposed by itself as an independent measure, but that the end might be facilitated if the proposal came before the League in the shape of an amendment to the Protocol, then an argument is here presented for proceeding not by way of a total rejection of the Protocol, but by a proposal for its revision.105. We suggest that, in any case, amendment rather than condemnation will be, tactically, the better course to pursue if only for the general reason that for those Powers who have signed the Protocol, and more particularly Prance, it will be easier to meet us if we preserve at least the semblance of keeping the Protocol in being than if we oppose to their scheme a simple negation.106. Another reason in favour of not throwing the Protocol overboard altogether, is that by so doing we should appear as the party directly responsible for frustrating the calling of the contemplated Disarmament Conference on Reduction of Armaments, which has been made dependent on the adoption of the Protocol by a sufficient number of Powers. Without wishing to express much confidence in the success of any such conference, we presume His Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer not to assume unnecessarily the odium of preventing it ab initio. They may avoid this by letting at least part of the framework of the Protocol survive.107. The second amendment on which we would lay stress as containing a strong argument for saving something of the Protocol is that by preserving, in the amended form we propose, article 13, we open the door to the introduction of our suggested form of a possible Security Pact with France and Belgium in a way which appears to us free from some of the very weighty objections that have from time to time been raised both here and in the Dominions to the conclusion of treaties of guarantee with those two Powers for the defence of their territories against an unprovoked German attack..108. During the preliminary discussions which took place at the Committee of Imperial Defence on the question, of the Geneva Protocol, the idea was mooted that the present opportunity might be utilised tq frame principles as to our attitude[12506] E
towards the League and its development in a shape which might form the basis of an International Conference, with a view to putting the League on a sounder footing by paving the way for the accession of the United States of America, Germany, and ultimately Russia. We have not interpreted our terms of reference as requiring us to enquire into a question of such high policy or to cover so wide a field of enquiry. It is possible that our proposals might remove some of the objections of the United States of America to the Covenant of the League, but the opinions of persons, who should be well informed on the subject, differ so widely on the question of the attitude of the United States of America towards the League that without much closer enquiry than we have been able to devote to the subject we hesitate to express any opinion whether their accession could in fact be secured by further amendments to the Covenant.109. Our conclusions and recommendations may then be summarised as follows:-- (1.) The Protocol tends to emphasise and extend provisions of the Covenant which were accepted with hesitation and which have been viewed with misgiving by British Government Departments since the United States of America decided not to become a Member of the League of Nations. In the attempt to complete the Covenant, the Assembly of the League has included in the Protocol features which were specifically rejected at the Paris peace conference or subsequently thereto. The Geneva Protocol, with its compulsory arbitration, its restrictions on the right to take defensive precautions, its automatic definition of an aggressor, its increased reliance on force, its provisions for working out plans for economic coercion and for ascertaining in advance the amount of force to be placed at the disposal of the League, and its tendency to enhance the authority of the Council at the expense of the States, goes considerably beyond the Covenant, which is based on the idea of using the moral force, of the public opinion of the world, with material force in the background.(2.) The Protocol introduces changes affecting the constitution of the League of Nations, and it is unsound that this constitution should be contained even provisionally in two separate documents. So far as the proposals contained in the Protocol are acceptable and desirable, they should be moved as amendments to the Covenant. If for purposes of convenience, they are provisionally incorporated in a Protocol, it should be on the clear understanding that they do not come into operation until they have been incorporated as amendments in the Covenant.(3.) The provisions in the following articles should be entirely rejected : Articles 2 to 6 ....   Compulsory arbitration.Article 7       .... ....   Suspension of defensive measures duringproceedings for pacific settlement.! Article 8       .... ....   Threat of aggression.Article 15     .... ....   Reparation and maintenance in all cir-cumstances   of   territorial  integrity and political independence. Article 16     .... ....   (Consequential.)Articles 17 and 21 have been dealt with in paragraph 86. Articles 19 and 20 are irrelevant unless the Protocol were to come into force as a separate document.(4.) In presenting the amendments to the Covenant and Protocol proposed in this Report there are two to which we attach special importance. The first is the proposal for a revision of the clause in article 16 of the Covenant regarding the automatic application of economic sanctions (see paragraphs 49 and 50). The second is the proposal in paragraph 69 for an amendment to article 13 of the Protocol, which opens the door to the introduction of our suggested form of a possible Security Pact with France and Belgium. While recognising that the rejection of a substantial part of the Protocol, coupled with the drastic amendments we propose to the remainder, might at first sight appear to render useless any effort to preserve what is left, we nevertheless incline to the view, for the reasons given in paragraphs 102-107, that the amend-ments we propose, though extremely difficult to carry if proposed by
themselves, might be accepted if presented in the shape of an amended Protocol. We believe also that the adoption of these amendments would be facilitated if preceded or accompanied by negotiations for the proposed pact of guarantee to France and Belgium.(5.) In case His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to pursue further the idea of a guarantee pact we suggest as a basis for consideration the draft in paragraph 96 of this Report.(6.) If our proposals are approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government it will be necessary first to reach an understanding with the Dominions and India. Since it will no doubt be far from easy to gain for our proposals the approval of those Members of the League who believe that they stand to gain from the adoption of the Protocol in its original form, the next step would probably be to try to come to terms with France and Belgium and other States which are Members of the Council before approaching the League. In these circumstances we recommend that an interim reply should be sent to the League, in time for circulation to Members before the meeting of the Council fixed for the 9th March, intimating briefly that we find it impossible to accept the Protocol as it stands, and stating that we are in consultation with the Dominions and India with regard to the terms of a further communication to be made to the League.Under the Covenant we have agreed to submit any dispute with another Member of the League which is &quot; likely to lead to a rupture &quot; either (A) to arbitration or (B) to enquiry by the Council (article 12).(A.) We have agreed to submit to Arbitration all disputes which we &quot; recognise to be suitable to arbitration and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy,&quot; and we have admitted that &quot; disputes as to the interpretation of a Treaty, as to any question of international law, as to the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of any international obligation, or as to the extent and nature of the reparation to be made for any such breach, are among those which are generally suitable for submission to arbitration&quot; (article 13).On the strength of the word &quot;generally,&quot; we might technically refuse arbitration in all cases.But supposing that we found it impossible so to refuse, then &quot; For the consideration of any such dispute, the court of arbitration to which the case is referred shall be the court agreed on by the parties to the dispute, or stipulated in any convention existing between them &quot; (article 13).We may agree with the other party to the dispute to refer it to (1) the Permanent Court, (2) some other arbitral body.Or we may fail to reach any special agreement, when the dispute would be referred to the body &quot; stipulated in any convention existing between them,&quot; which might be either (1) or (2). Or there might be no convention, in which case arbitration seems to be blocked, but, going back to article 12, we should have to agree to enquiry by the Council.In any case where there is resort to arbitration, &quot;the Members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award that may be rendered, and that they will not resort to war against a Member of the League which complies therewith. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.&quot; (Article 13.) &quot;    &apos;&quot;M. P. A.

(B.) We have agreed that all disputes &quot; likely to lead to a rupture,&quot; which are not submitted to arbitration, shall be submitted to the Council.Any party to the dispute may take the initiative in bringing the dispute before the Council.Then, unless the Council can &quot;find,&quot; on the claim of any party, that the dispute arises out of a matter which by international law is &quot; solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party,&quot; the Council shall- (1.) &quot; Endeavour to effect a settlement.&quot; .... (2.) If it fails, it shall publish a report and recommendations.(a.) If the report is unanimously agreed to by all the members other than the parties to the dispute, &quot;the Members of the League agree that iV they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which 1 complies with the recommendations of the report.&quot;(6.) If the Council fails to reach such a unanimous report, &quot; the Members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice.&quot;   (Article 15.)Thus, under the Covenant, we have agreed that every dispute likely to lead to a rupture with a Member of the League must be submitted either to arbitration or to the Council unless it is allowed by the Council to be a matter solely within the domestic jurisdiction of one of the parties. If we agree to arbitration, we are pledged to &quot; carry out in full good faith any award that may be rendered.&quot; In cases where there is no resort to arbitration, the dispute must be submitted to the Council, and this can be done against our wish as &quot; any party to the dispute &quot; may seize the Council of it.Under the Covenant the Council only acts in a quasi-arbitral capacity in cases where the members, other than those who may be parties to the dispute, make recommendations unanimously&apos;; and in that case we are only pledged &quot;not to go to war with any party to the dispute which complies with the recommendations of the report.&quot;The Protocol constitutes an extension of the two principles of arbitration and enquiry by the Council. In the first place (article 3), it makes the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court compulsory in the cases enumerated in article 13 of the Covenant (see above). We might make reservations to our acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, but it would nevertheless remain the fact that we should have to admit that certain cases came within that jurisdiction. In the second place the Protocol extends very greatly the arbitral authority of the Council.(1.) Between the stage of endeavouring to &quot; effect a settlement &quot; (i.e., mediatory action) and that of making a report and recommendations, it provides for the establishment of a special machinery of arbitration. If the parties themselves are not agreed on arbitration, a special committee of arbitrators may be constituted at the request of any one of the parties, and this Committee, if the parties cannot agree on its selection, is appointed by the Council &quot;in consultation with the parties.&quot; (Nothing specific is said on the question how the Council proceeds with this appointment, but it would presumably act by a majority vote, as article 5 of the Covenant says : &quot;All matters of procedure .... including the appointment of Committees to investigate particular matters, shall be regulated .... by the Council and may be decided by a majority of the Members of the League represented at the meeting.&quot;) This committee of arbitrators refers any point to the Permanent Court at the request of any one of the parties.(2.) If none of the parties desire arbitration, the Council makes a report. If this report is concurred in unanimously by all the members other than the parties to the dispute, &quot; the signatory States agree to comply with the recommendations therein.&quot; In similar circumstances, under the Covenant, Members of the League are only pledged &quot;not to go to war with any party which complies with the recommendations.&quot;Here is a great difference between the two documents. Imagine a case where State A wrongs State B. The Council recommends unanimously that A shall pay B  1,000,000. Under the Covenant, no Member of the League may go to war with A if it pays up the  1,000,000 (nor would anyone wish to, though previous creditors
Come before the Court, whose Come before the Council,jurisdiction we should have recognised as compulsory.If the other side demandsarbitration: Committee of Arbitrators.If neither side demands arbitration:Unanimous report by Council, reference by thebinding on  us:   hence a Council   toQuasi-Arbitral Award. Arbitrators.Compulsory arbitration &apos;&apos; therefore covers under the Protocol potentially as wide a field as &quot;the enquiry by the Council &quot; provided for in the Covenant.Either under the Covenant or under the Protocol the only plea on which we can oppose the reference of any dispute, either to arbitration or to enquiry by the Council, is that the dispute arises out of a matter which is &quot; solely within the domestic jurisdiction &quot; of one of the parties. Under paragraph 8 of article 15 of the Covenant the Council has to &quot; find &quot; that the matter in dispute is of such a nature. Article 5 of the Covenant provides that, &quot; except where otherwise expressly provided in . this Covenant or by the terms of the present treaty, decisions at any meeting of the Council shall require the agreement of all the Members.&quot; There is no mention of a majority vote in paragraph 8 of article 15, and therefore the Council finding would have to be unanimous. But as parties to the dispute are, under paragraph 6 of article 15, debarred from voting, we must presume that the unanimous vote is required only of members who are not parties. Nothing is said as to what happens if unanimity is. not achieved, but it is safe to say that in practice the Council would decide to refer to the Permanent Court; This they could do by a majority, probably, under the second paragraph of article 5 of the Covenant.The Protocol expressly confirms paragraph 8 of article 15 of the Covenant. The only innovation which the Protocol introduces is that, if the dispute has passed out of the hands of the Council and has come before arbitrators, under article 4, a claim that the matter in dispute is one solely within the jurisdiction of one of fehe parties is referred by the arbitrators to the Court via the Council (the latter acting apparently only as a channel of communication). This in practice would probably not alter the situation very greatly. Any such claim, if it had any shadow of substantiation, would probably be raised before the arbitration stage was reached. If it was not, and if it was such that the Council, if it had had to-consider it, would have accepted it unanimously, it seems probable that the&apos;of A might exert pressure to prevent their own claims being prejudiced by the , payment). But, under the Protocol, A has agreed to comply with the award, and z has pledged himself to pay.(3.) If the Council cannot reach a unanimous report, it itself refers the matter to arbitration.Then follows a paragraph, referring apparently to the procedure under any of the three heads above, which provides that &quot; The Signatory States undertake that they will carry out in full good faith any judicial sentence or arbitral award that may be rendered and that they will comply with the solutions recommended by the Council.&quot;Thus the Protocol really applies, or may apply, compulsory arbitration to the whole field of international disputes. That is, if we signed and ratified the Protocol, and if it came into effect, any dispute between us and another signatory, which could not be settled amicably, might become the subject of compulsory arbitration, except only in a case where we could establish that the dispute arose out of a matter solely within our domestic jurisdiction. For, with the exception of the last-named category, all disputes fall within one of the two categories: (1.) Those within the jurisdiction (2.) All other disputes,of the Court.
Court would do likewise. If it was such as not to achieve unanimous approval by the Council, it would probably, even under the Covenant, go on before the Court.The foregoing comparison of the two documents-the Covenant and the Protocol shows what advance the latter makes in the direction of compulsory arbitration.The position might be summarised as follows : Under the Covenant, it is conceivable that no dispute should ever go before any Court of Arbitration, but all disputes would then have to go before the Council, which acts purely as a mediatory body, except in the case where it makes a unanimous recommendation. Even in such a case the recommendation has a somewhat limited binding force.Under the Protocol, certain classes of dispute must be submitted to the Permanent Court, whose jurisdiction is obligatory. All other disputes, if not taken voluntarily to a Court of Arbitration, would go to the Council, whose decision, if unanimous, is binding. If the Council is not unanimous, it calls in arbitrators, in whose choice the parties would have no say,: and whose decision would also be binding.Thus, under the Protocol, all roads lead to arbitration, aiid any disputes in which we might be involved would be liable to be made the subject of an arbitral award given possibly by arbitrators appointed by the Council without our concurrence.ANNEX II. Revised Draft Protocol.Article 1.The Signatory States undertake to make every effort to secure the introduction into the Covenant of amendments on the lines of the provisions contained in the following articles.Article 2.The existence of demilitarised zones being calculated to pre-vent aggression and to facilitate a definite finding of the nature provided for in article 3 below, the establishment of such zones between States mutually consenting thereto is recommended as a means of preventing the violation of the Covenant.The demilitarised zones already existing under the terms of certain treaties or conventions, or which may ibe established in future between States mutuaTIv consenting thereto, may, at the request and at the expense of one or more of the coterminous States, and subject to the consent of the State in which the demilitarised zone is situated except in so far as under an existing treaty or convention such consent may not be required  be placed under a permanent or temporary system of supervision to be organised by the Council.Article 3.For the purposes of the Covenant, any Member of the League which resorts to war, in violation of the undertakings contained in the Covenant, is designated an aggressor. Whether the Member resorting to war has, in fact, in so doing violated those undertakings, is a question to be determined by the Council acting unanimously, with the exception of the parties to the dispute.If the Council is unable to arrive at any such determination it shall use its best efforts to persuade the parties to agree to an armistice. Any belligerent which, after accepting such an armistice, wilfully violates its terms shall be deemed an aggressor.Violation of the rules laid down for a demilitarised zone may be held by the Council to be equivalent to a resort to war.[The tentative redraft of paragraph 1 of article 10 of the Covenant, if adopted, might be inserted here, if desired (see paragraph 50 of the Report). ](Substitute for article 1 of the Protocol.)(Substitute for article 9.)(Substitute for article 10.)
Article 4.The Council shall notify forthwith to the Members of the League that a State is an aggressor, and such notification shall be conclusive until it is revoked or until the state of war which gave rise to the notification of the aggression is terminated.The Members of the League agree that, as from the date on which they receive a notification from the Council that one or more Member States are aggressors, every Member State not declared an aggressor is bound, so far as its rights and powers extend, to co-operate loyally and effectively in support of the Covenant of the League of Nations and in resistance to the aggression, by means of such measures of the kind contemplated in article 16 of the Covenant as are best suited to the circumstances of the particular case, and any Member State shall for the purpose of such action be entitled to exercise the rights of a belligerent.Article. 5.When the event contemplated in the preceding article has arisen, the Council may, if it thinks fit, make recommendations from time to time, for the consideration of the various Govern-ments concerned, as to the economic and financial measures of the kind contemplated in article 16 of the Covenant, which it deems best suited in the circumstances to bring the aggression to an end. It is, however, clearly understood that the obligations of the Members of the League with regard to such measures under the preceding article of this Protocol are in no way suspended or diminished, pending the receipt of any such recommendations.In preparation for the eventual exercise of its powers under this article, the Council may, from time to time, invite the economic and financial organisations of the League to study the general character of the measures which might be proposed in order to give effect, within the limits of the rights and powers of the States, to the provisions of the Covenant relating to economic and financial sanctions and measures of mutual co-operation.Article 6.The measures provided for in article 16 of the Covenant may legally be applied by Members of the League until such time as the Council shall declare that the state of war which gave rise to the notification of aggression is terminated.The Signatory States agree that in view o&apos;f the uncertainty and confusion that would otherwise arise on the restoration of normal relations, especially as to the position of contracts, they will come to a general understanding on this subject as soon as possible by means of a supplementary agreement.This agreement shall be based on the general principle that, unless otherwise agreed between the parties, contracts, the performance of which was interrupted by the sanctions, shall be revived, wherever practicable, subject to necessary modifications of dates, and that no claims shall arise from action legally taken in pursuance of the Covenant, except that the aggressor may be required in certain circumstances to compensate the Signatory States or their nationals.Article 7.In view of the contingent military, naval and air sanctions provided for by article 16 of the Covenant, Members of the League may intimate to the Council,the specific contingencies in which they will be prepared to make their maximum military, naval and air effort to oppose possible acts of aggression.Any agreement mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be published by the Secretariat of the League of Nations.(New article, place of last paragraph of article 10.)(Substitute for article 11 [Article 11 amended].)In(Substitute for article 12 [Article 12, paragraph 2, amended].)(Substitute for article 14.)(Substitute for article 13.)
$ . I    ANNEX III.Draft Heads of Articles to serve as basis of discussion for the supplementary agreement contemplated in article 6 of the Draft Protocol regulating the situation on the restoration of normal relations after an aggression.1. It is mutually agreed that the restoration of normal relations after the discontinuance of economic and financial sanctions shall involve the revival of all contracts between nationals of the two States concerned, the performance of which was interrupted by the sanctions (unless in the case of any contract it is otherwise agreed between the parties, or unless performance of the contract has become impossible), and for the purpose of such revival any dates in such contracts shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be postponed by the period during which the notification of aggression was in force. If a national of a Signatory State other than the aggressor considers himself prejudiced by the modification of such dates or by the cancellation of a contract, which it is impossible to revive, he may apply for equitable compensation to a Tribunal to be established by the League of Nations. Any compensation awarded by the Tribunal shall be paid by the Aggressor State.2, The same Tribunal shall also decide, in the event of disagreement between the parties, whether a contract has become impossible of performance and whether a date fixed by any contract should be postponed.3. Periods of prescription and limitation of right of action and periods for the presentation or protest or notification of non-acceptance or of non-payment of negotiable instruments and periods for the payment of fees or performance of formalities in connection with industrial property shall be extended by the period during which the notification of aggression was in force.4. Each member State recognises that in the event of being notified to be an aggressor in manner provided by the Covenant, the other member States have the right (notwithstanding any provision of treaty or of international law) to apply to it the measures contemplated in article 16 of the Covenant, and it hereby accepts liability in that event for defraying the cost of those measures, to such an amount and in such manner as the Council may direct, including payment of any compensation that may be awarded by the Tribunal referred to in the preceding article. It also accepts exclusive liability in such an event for any damage suffered by its nationals from the aforesaid measures, and will consequently restrain its Courts from entertaining any claims against another member State or a national of such State on account of such damage.5. It is further agreed that as between nationals of member States (other than the aggressor), it shall be a good defence to any proceedings for damage that the damage complained of was caused by action taken in pursuance of article 16 of the Covenant. * J

ARBITRATION,  SECURITY  AND  REDUCTION   OF  ARMAMENTS. Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes. (Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of 188th Meeting, Minute 2.)THE Committee had under consideration the question of Arbitration, Security and Reduction of Armaments, with special reference to the Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, and various Memoranda containing Departmental criticisms of the Protocol (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 517-B, 526-B, 527-B, 536-B, 537-B, 538-B, 539-B, 540-B, 541-B, and 542-B).THE PRIME MINISTER said that all present knew the purpose for which this Meeting had been called. He was glad to be in the Chair to-day, although he was afraid that he might not be able to come often to the Meetings of the Committee. The Lord President of the Council, however, had been good enough to accept the position of Chairman, and had devoted a great deal of time to the matter under discussion.   He therefore proposed to invite Lord Curzon now to lead the discussion.LORD CURZON (stenographic note) : In response to the invitation of the Prime Minister, I will endeavour to make a preliminary statement by way of facilitating the very important labours upon which we are about to enter. I say that they are very important, because it seems to me that this question which has been submitted to us is by far the most momentous, both in its scope and in its conse-quences, that has ever been laid before the Committee of Imperial Defence.We are met here not to examine a theoretical plan or to embark upon an academic discussion for the reduction of armaments or the prevention of war in the future. It is really very much more than that, because, as we read through the Papers that have been submitted to us, we see that in these proposals are involved the future security and almost, we might say, the existence of our State and Empire; our future relations with France; our future relations with the United States of America; and our relations with our own Dominions and India, involving in all probability the vast problem of the continued unity of the Empire. All those issues, I venture to submit, are involved in this discussion. Therefore, I am sure you will agree with me that we must all approach it with becoming gravity.I hope, too, Prime Minister, you will allow me to say that I think the utmost secrecy ought to attend these proceedings. It is obvious that they will be prolonged. Many people will be anxious, as we go on, to find out exactly what we are doing about the Protocol. I hope that the secrecy which has always shrouded the doings of this Committee will be most carefully preserved on the present occasion, and that nothing will be said as to the course of our proceedings.May I briefly state the facts of the case as theyare at this moment? We are met here to examine this draft Protocol which was concluded at Geneva a few months ago. The Protocol has so far been signed only by one great European Power-France. It has been signed by nine other States, none of which is in the first order of importance. The most important are probably Czechoslovakia and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State. Great Britain has not so far signed, and that is the reason why the matter has come before us. It will, no doubt, have to be discussed in Parliament at a later date. The idea is that, if this Protocol be ratified by a sufficient number of States -though what is the exact test of sufficiency I do not remember  an International Conference on Disarmament is to take place in the course of next summer. The idea is that this Conference should adopt some general plan for disarmament, and then, but not until then, the Protocol (assuming it to have been ratified) will come into force.   Those are what I call the facts of the case.Now as to the Papers that come before us. I am afraid that they are immense in volume, and perhaps that may have rendered it difficult for everybody at this table to have studied them all, but I think I may summarise the position as follows :: In the first place, among the printed Papers we have a full account of the pro-ceedings at Geneva and the events that led up thereto. We have had circulated the speeches made by the late Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister (M. Herriot) at Geneva. We have the full Report of the two Committees that were there appointed, and the result of whose labours was this draft Protocol. We have the explanation by those Committees of the reasons that led them to draw it up, and of their justification for it, Article by Article. We have the report of our own representatives, who in the most important Committee were Lord Parmoor and
Mr. Henderson. I am not quite clear, not knowing the inner history, but 1 gather that these two gentlemen were left at rather a loose end, with no yery definite instructions from the Government here, to make the best of the business that they could upon the general lines laid down in the speech of the Prime Minister. Obviously, this put them in a very difficult position, and we may recall how the reports in the Press from day to day indicated changes, or what appeared to be changes, of attitude on their part, which greatly puzzled public opinion at home. However, they eventually agreed to this draft Protocol; and we have the report which they sent to the Government at home, explaining and justifying their action. Then, finally, still reverting to the time when the late Government was in power, we have two Papers from the Admiralty at that time, each of which is preceded by a state-ment by the then First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Chelmsford, who directed a very searching and powerful criticism against the Protocol as it has now emerged.The next set of Papers includes a Paper by the Chiefs of the three Staffs here, and I invite your attention to that Paper, not merely because of its intrinsic weight, but because of the cogency, the brevity and the power with which the conclusions at which it arrives are stated. That Paper has been followed by a statement submitted by the present Secretary of State for Air, Sir Samuel Hoare, giving his views upon the matter.The next group of Papers came from the Foreign Office. Unfortunately, the Secretary of State is away, engaged, as we know, on public affairs of the greatest importance, but I think I shall not be wrong in assuming that his views are repre-sented by the Departmental Notes, and they consist in the main of two a very useful Paper containing a good deal of comment and criticism by Mr. Campbell, of the Foreign Office, and, if I may say so in his presence, an exceedingly powerful statement of the case by Sir Eyre Crowe, who is with us to-day.The next group of Papers contains the opinions of the Treasury, and Board of Trade, more especially, of course, upon the financial and economic aspects of the scheme, and in reading them you will note a remarkable similarity I think I might say an almost complete identity of reasoning applied to the Articles of the Protocol.Finally, we have two Papers drawn up by Sir Maurice Hankey. The first of them, a criticism of the Protocol, looking at it in many respects from a new point of view, an independent point of view; and, secondly, a Paper which he was good enough to prepare after consultation with me, namely, a synopsis of the various arguments that have been brought by the different Departments. That Paper has only been circulated last night or this morning; but, if i may be allowed to say so, I think its perusal will be very helpful to all of us.It may be said, therefore, that to a large extent our work has been done for us-done for us to this extent, that I think it ought to be unnecessary to invite the Heads of the various Departments to repeat here seriatim the arguments that they have already developed so effectively upon paper.The second point that one cannot help noting about these criticisms is the extraordinary consensus of opinion to which they all lead, approaching the subject as they do from the different angles of the interests and the Departments they represent. ^I should like, in the few words I am about to say, to give a brief sketch of the main points to which this volume and consensus of criticism has been directed; and I do it with a view to rendering it unnecessary that these points should be pursued and elaborated in detail. I think I may divide the criticisms which have been directed against the draft Protocol into two classes those which have been aimed at particular provisions in the scheme, and those of a more general character, that assail it in its entirety.One of the greatest changes that is proposed in the draft Protocol is the provision that compulsory arbitration shall be applied by the Permanent Court in the future to all disputes, subject to reservations by individual States. With regard to this proposal doubts have been raised in the various Departmental Papers; first, as to the probable impartiality and competence of the Court; secondly, as to the risks and perils that may be involved in this system; thirdly, as to the attitude which the Dominions may be expected to take up towards it; fourthly, as to the willingness or unwillingness of the British Parliament, and equally also of the Dominion Parliaments, to accept the decisions of the Permanent Court thus referred to on questions, for instance, such as that which has been disturbing us during the past few weeks, namely, our position in Egypt, our status in the Sudan, and the provisions to be adopted for the security of the Suez Canal; fifthly, Sir Eyre Crowe, in the [12370] &apos; b 2
Paper to which I have referred, argues, and I think demonstrates, that these particular proposals are quite incompatible with British practice as it has hitherto existed; sixthly, there seems to be a general consensus that these particular proposals, whatever their intrinsic merits, would greatly incense the United States of America, and are foreign from every conception of arbitration as it presents itself to them; lastly, Sir Maurice Hankey points out in his Paper that the machinery which it is proposed to set up for this purpose of compulsory arbitration overlaps and in some cases appears to clash rather sharply with the machinery set up by the Washington Conference between two and three years ago.The next point to which I should like to invite your attention is this. It is pointed out in many of the Papers, notably in the Staff Papers, that the provisions in Article 7 to prevent aggressive action will fetter the mobility of our own forces in the future and will prevent us from taking the elementary precautions that are necessary in such cases precautions such as those we have had to take during the past fortnight in Egypt, and in the case (of which probably little is known outside this room, and perhaps not known here before) of Persia, which has been causing us some anxiety, and that these provisions would therefore strike at the roots of our Imperial detence.Then I come to the case about the economic sanctions; and here the argument which has been developed in these Papers, notably in the criticisms of the Board of Trade and the Treasury, amounts to the following. They urge that if these sanctions were adopted they would entail an immense expenditure; that they would interfere at vital points with the whole structure and life of the nation; that they must involve great injury to British trade; that they would be attended with grave financial, danger to the country; and, more serious still, that they could not be put into effective operation without the co-operation of the whole world, and more particularly of the United States of America; that they could only be enforced after a declaration of a state of war; and that if it were attempted to apply them without the co-operation and consent of the United States of America we might become involved in con-troversies with the latter similar to those which some of us recall very well, as having, in the early stages of the War, almost brought us to the point of a rupture with America; and, indeed, that it is more than conceivable that in such a case as I am postulating we might eventually be involved in a rupture with America and possibly in something worse.That, I think, is a summary of the main criticisms which have been directed against the economic and financial sanctions recommended in the Protocol.The only other point I will allude to in this part is a reference to Article 15, which is one of the points that has, not unnaturally, attracted very severe criticism. It is the Article which says : &quot; The signatory States agree that the whole cost of any military, naval or air operations undertaken for the repression of .an aggression under the terms of the Protocol, and reparation for all losses suffered by individuals, whether civilians or combatants, and for all material damage caused by the operations of both sides, shall be borne by the aggressor State up to the extreme limit of its capacity.&quot;That Article, novel in its character and almost illimitable in its scope, raises, naturally enough, such questions as this: How is such a decision to be enforced? How is compulsion to be applied to force the aggressor State to pay ? and the further question whether, if the Article is attempted to be acted upon, we shall not be raising up before us a whole host of reparation problems in the future similar to those which have been the curse of our national existence ever since the War, and which, until they are settled, will allow of no peace in Europe again. I need not pursue the argument; we shall no doubt develop it later on. I merely indicate that, with regard to the actual contents of the Protocol, this is one of the provisions that has attracted, and not unnaturally, the very severest criticism.&quot; I only ask, further, leave to summarise what appear to me to be in these various Papers the general criticisms that have been directed against the Protocol, and which those who defend it will be called upon to meet.Firstly, it is pointed out that this is really a movement in an inverse direction from that which has hitherto been adopted both by ourselves and by the majority of the States who were signatories of the Covenant of the League. As we may recall, the Covenant of the League itself, drawm up in haste in Paris five or six years ago, in some ignorance of the exact nature of the problems to be met, because, of course,
it was largely experimental, was necessarily, and I think perhaps wisely, rather vague in its phraseology and rather elastic in its possibilities of interpretation. I should be inclined myself, if I may say so, to say that that was its wisdom and its strength. Anyhow, any attempts made since to alter it, notably by our Dominions and especially by Canada, have been in the direction of rendering it less stiff and rigid than before. But now, as I say, you have an absolutely inverse movement to render the Covenant more watertight, more rigid, more exact, more precise. One sees perfectly well the object with which this was done. But do not let us shut our eyes to the fact that those who say that the Covenant is not substantially altered but is only expanded are not far from wholly misstating the real truth. The Covenant is absolutely revolutionised, and revolutionised in the direction I have endeavoured to describe. Let me give you two illustrations. In the first place, you see in the draft an attempt to give an exact definition, for the first time, of what is an &quot;aggressor&quot; and what constitutes an &quot;aggression,&quot; of what is the meaning of the phrase &quot;resort to war.&quot; Still more remarkable, whereas the use of force has hitherto been the result only of a unanimous decision on the part of the Council, you now have the startling change proposed that the decision shall be in future by a majority of two-thirds.The next point of general criticism which you will find in these Papers is that the draft, if accepted, will impose very heavy commitments, notably upon our own country, which it will be very embarrassing for us to accept and absolutely impossible to fulfil, and must immensely increase our own responsibilities throughout the world. Nay, further, the Chiefs of Staff, in the Paper that I mentioned before, record this view, the seriousness of which it is impossible&apos; cither to exaggerate or to ignore :-&quot; The Services feel it their solemn duty unanimously to state that, in their opinion, acceptance of the Protocol will be fraught with grave danger, not only to the security, unity and sovereignty of the Empire, but also to its honour and good name.&quot;That is a very strong and significant pronouncement, particularly as it is pointed out in these Papers that the Protocol, if ratified by us, would place the British Navy in an ambiguous, a false, and, it might be, a humiliating position. The main burden arising from the acceptance of the Protocol would, it is true, fall upon the British Navy. All sorts of obnoxious duties would be placed upon its shoulders; it would begin by being the watch-dog, and would end in all probability by being the scape-goat, of the world; and the representatives of the Navy in the late Government as well as of this Government pointed out with great force that the British Navy could not possibly accept such a position.As regards the Air, I need say no more than that Sir Samuel Hoare, in the Paper to which I have referred, shows that it is inconsistent with the principles of air warfare as- we act upon them now. The Staffs as a whole point out that it is incompatible with the whole theory of British Imperial defence as it has hitherto been interpreted. They also point out that, so far from reducing armaments, which is the object for which the whole thing is, of course, designed, the result will be, in consequence of the great weight of obligations entailed upon us, almost inevitably an increase. Those who speak for the Empire argue that it is in the highest degree unlikely that the&apos; sum total of these commitments would be&apos; accepted by the British Dominions and therefore we might find ourselves, if we pursued the&apos; matter, not only in dissent from them, but seriously compromising the whole cause of Imperial unity. The Foreign: Office points out, in particular 3hat any such obligations&apos;would in all probability greatly increase the antagonism of ihe United States and would keep them indefinitely out of the League which they-have hitherto declined to enter and into which we all of us want to get them.The: last point, made with great force in almost all the Papers, is this, that the Protocol really cuts- a slashing gash into the root of national sovereignty, that it involves a very serious loss of national independence, and that it does convert the League into the very thing we have always been trying to avoid, namely, into a sort of super-State, a conception which is really quite inconsistent with the grounds upon which it was created and which would in all probability be fatal to its utility in the future. I will only give one illustration of this, and that is the provision in the Protocol that the decision as to withdrawal of sanctions, that ^ is to say, the substitution of a state of peace for a state of war, should be left in the hands of the Council of the League. It is not stated, but I imagine we may infer that, in such conditions, the decision of the Council would- have to be unanimous: If that be so, it is obvious that it will be in the power of any one State represented on - [12370] b 3
the Council-it might be a small state, or, on the other hand, it might be a great State by refusing its assent, indefinitely to prolong hostilities. Again, it might have the consequence that States would be called upon to fight, however, reluctant to do so and however anxious to terminate the struggle, and be called upon to go on indefinitely because the unanimous consent of the Council could not be procured.The sum total of these criticisms is, in the minds of those who make them, that it really is by no means certain that this Protocol, if accepted in anything like its present form, would not really be provocative of strife rather than conducive to peace.That is a general summary, and, I hope, a not unfair one, of the arguments that are contained in all these Papers, the whole of which I have read, and which contain, of course, a mass of detailed criticism applied to every Article of the Protocol and also to the Preamble, to which it is unnecessary for me to refer to-day.As regards our own course of procedure, I have made this summary rather with the idea of suggesting that it will not be necessary for each individual Department to state again what they have put upon paper and what I have ventured to summarise here. May we go a little further? Of course, we must wait to hear what the discussion will produce, but I should have thought that the perusal of these Papers would have led up tentatively to one conclusion, namely, that the Protocol in its present form is one which no British Government, neither the late British Government nor any British Government, would be likely to accept. I am not suggesting that any resolution should be passed, either now or in the future, rejecting.it. That would be subject to grave misunderstanding and would probably be very unwise. But I should have thought that in the background of bur minds must inevitably be the conclusion that it is useless to go on discussing it and taking a vote whether we accept it or not, because it is apparent from the consensus of opinion that the answer to such a question can only be in the negative. Then there is the further question as to whether it would be worth while to sit down and endeavour, Article by Article, line by line, to amend it. I do not venture to give an opinion upon that point at present; I will only say that, if undertaken, it would be a prodigious task, and, further, supposing it to be amended by us, that does not end the matter. Supposing we drew up a new draft, we cannot dictate to Europe the form of Protocol that she should accept, and the production of an amended Protocol by us here, despatched to Geneva or elsewhere, whatever the reception it met with, would be the beginning of a prolonged controversy. That is all that I am entitled to say at the present moment. I think I have in my own mind and I have discussed it with some of my colleagues here suggestions as to the kind of alternative action that, if we decided not to sit down and try to amend the draft line by line, it might be wise for us to adopt. It would be premature for me to state them now; I only feel very strongly that it is out of the question that we should reject it and do nothing more. We shall still have to consider the case of France, with whom the whole question of her security is for the time being involved in the Protocol; we shall have to consider the question of the future of the League and its continued existence as a great pacific force; we shall have to consider the question of drawing in America, if we can; and lastly, of arriving at decisions in accordance with the views of our Dominions. We cannot commit ourselves, of course, without consulting the Dominions; that has been an accepted principle from the start.I therefore leave the^ question in this rather tentative shape, and will only express the hope that the summary I have given may be of some little use in facilitating our labours.(The remainder of these Minutes are a summary from long-hand notes.)THE&apos; PRIME MINISTER, on behalf of the Committee, expressed his thanks to Lord Curzon for the infinite amount of trouble which he had taken in studying the question and for the very lucid summary of the various documents which he had given to the Committee. He expressed himself as being in complete agreement with Lord Curzon that it would not be possible to reach any decision at the present meeting. He suggested that, in the first instance, Lord Balfour and Lord Cecil, who did not represent any particular Government Department, should express their views.LORD BALFOUR, after concurring in the remarks made by the Prime Minister with regard to the opening statement which had been made by Lord Curzon, expressed the opinion that it would be difficult to enter into any detailed discussion
with regard to the Protocol unless there was present at the meeting anyone who was prepared to defend it. As far as he had been able to ascertain from the various documents which had been circulated, nothing had yet been said by any Minister or by any Department in its favour. Whilst he was not prepared at the present stage to give a final opinion on the subject, he considered that if it was decided ultimately to reject the Protocol in its present form it would be inadvisable to publish to the world even a tenth of the arguments which had been put forward by the various Departments against that instrument. He suggested, therefore, that it would be advisable for the Government to take its stand on the simple proposition that it was impossible to agree to any document which put forward proposals of such an experimental nature unless or until the United States of America became a member of the League of Nations. Such an attitude would, in his opinion, be perfectly logical in the light of what had happened since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. This Treaty had originally set up the League of Nations on the supposition that the United States would be a member of the League, and in addition this country and the United States had entered into the Tripartite Agreement to guarantee the security of Prance against aggression. Eventually, however, not only had the United States refused to become a member of the League, but also had withdrawn from the agreement to guarantee French security. He was doubtful if progress could be made on the lines of the present Protocol whilst the United States remained an isolated, independent, and possibly hostile power. Although this argument was based solely on the case of the United States, he was of the opinion that it might be found to apply with equal force to the case of Germany or that of Russia. For the present, however, he considered that the abstention of the United States was a sufficient argument to warrant the rejection .of the Protocol. He was of the opinion that it was better to put forward some-simple reason for refusing to sign than to enter into complicated discussions on the demerits of the various Articles of the Protocol. He did not think that the other members of the League could take exception to our attitude if it were based on such undeniable grounds. He pointed out that these views must not be taken as his final considered opinion on the subject, as he might wish to modify them in the light of the subsequent discussion.. ^LORD CECIL stated that he was not prepared to express a final opinion at the present juncture. He had read the various documents which had been circulated on the subject, but he still felt that there was the greatest need for minute examination of the attitude which had been taken up by the various Departments. He had always regarded the question from the point of view of whether it was possible to advance the cause of disarmament by methods of this kind. He pointed out that this country was bound by Treaty obligations to advance the cause of general disarmament, which was of vital importance to this country from the financial point of view and for our own national security. He could foresee no prospect of permanent peace in the world until general disarmament had been effectively carried out. He hoped that the Committee, in considering the question, would keep that point of view before them. He did not think that it would be sufficient for the Government of this country merely to reject the Protocol and point out their objections to it, but considered that the whole principle as to whether disarmament could be achieved by international agreement must be examined. He pressed for further consideration of the question before any definite conclusion was arrived at, and suggested that the discussion should be postponed until the next meeting of the Committee. He also suggested that the question as to whether any possible alterna-tive method could be found for furthering the cause of disarmament should be examined. He stated that he was not perfectly satisfied that the method suggested by Lord Balfour was practicable; moreover, he was not certain that the co-operation of the United States was essential, although he considered that the co-operation of Germany, and possibly of Russia, would be required in order that such a Protocol might be effective. He pointed out that the Protocol dealt with four main subjects, firstly, it dealt with the proposal to recognise the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice as compulsory instead of optional; it then dealt with three other main propositions : (a) that every international dispute must be submitted, in the first instance, for adjudication by one of the organs of the League; (b) in case of an attack on any particular State, that all Signatories to the Protocol must come to the assistance of that State; and (c) that the Protocol should not come into force until an agreed scheme of disarmament had been arrived at. He personally considered that the last clause should in reality come first, since the whole existence of the Protocol turned upon agreement being reached with regard to general disarmament.
If such an agreement were reached, the general burden of the commitments involved would naturally be lessened. He also considered that the proposal to hold a Disarmament Conference next June was somewhat optimistic, since he was doubtful if a sufficient number of States would have ratified the Protocol by that date, and he expressed the opinion that the very earliest date on which such a Conference could be held would be a year from the present time. In consequence, he urged the Committee not to reach a final conclusion too rapidly, and pressed for the most careful examination of the whole question.Mr. AMERY stated that he did not propose to embark at the present stage on a detailed criticism of the Protocol. He wished, however, to make a few remarks with regard to the procedure and the facts governing the procedure which should be adopted/in the examination of this question. He expressed the opionion that an impossible situation would arise should the Governments of some portions of the British Empire agree to sign the Protocol while the Governments, of other portions of the Empire rejected it. He considered the Government of this country were: not in a position to arrive at a definite decision until consultation had taken place with the Governments of the Dominions and India, and a decision had been reached which could be put forward as the decision of the British Empire as a whole. He considered that it would be preferable to request the Dominions and India to nominate representatives to attend a Conference on the subject than to attempt to reach agreement by correspondence. He was in agreement with Lord Cecil that it was impossible simply to turn the Protocol down without putting forward some alternative scheme framed to promote the cause of peace. Such a course, he considered, would lay this country open to severe criticism on the grounds that we were continually rejecting scheme after scheme put forward by the League of Nations on negative grounds of detail, and not on issues of principle. He suggested that a small Sub-Committee should be formed to examine the main fundamental principles on which not only the present Protocol was based but also on which the League of Nations was constituted. It might then be possible to put forward some proposi-tions with regard to the amendment of the constitution of the League of Nations which might get rid of certain features in the constitution which were alarming to the Dominions and also to the United States.Mr. CHURCHILL stated that he had never considered that the League of Nations, in view of the present state of the world, was in a position to preserve peace. He was of the opinion that the preservation of peace could only be attained by the maintenance of good understandings between various groups of Powers, possibly arrived at under the auspices of the League of Nations. He did not consider that people would undertake obligations of an unlimited character which it was impossible to define. He suggested that the proper method to be adopted was to work in stages by means of regional agreements under the League of Nations to protect special points of danger, and by making definite tracts of country demilitarised zones, which would be kept free from all troops and military works. In the first instance, such a zone might be drawn up between France and Germany, and various Powers might be induced to guarantee the sanctity of such a zone. Whichever of the two Powers, France or Germany, was the first to violate this zone, that Power would then become &quot; the aggressor,&quot; and would be dealt with as such by the Powers who were signatories to the regional agreement. As a second stage he suggested that the same scheme could be applied to the Polish side and- a demilitarised zone laid down there. He pointed out that all the Powers who were signatories to one agreement might not necessarily, be signatories to another. Such schemes might eventually be applied to all points of danger in the world, and he suggested that it was desirable to go from one practical step to another. If these schemes were worked out under the aegis of the League of Nations, the authority of the League would be vastly strengthened. With regard to the present Protocol, he was in agreement with the suggestions put forward by Lord Balfour as to the reasons for its rejection. He considered that such a statement would eventually act on the conscience of the United States and thereby induce them to become a Member of the League.SIR SAMUEL HOARE stated that although he disliked the Protocol in its present form, he considered that it would be fatal for this country simply to reject it without putting forward any alternative proposals. He was in agreement with Mr. Amery&apos;s proposal for the appointment of a Sub-Committee to examine the question.   He considered that cuch a Sub-Committee should examine not only the
oprinciples, but should also go into a more detailed survey of the question. In the meantime, he considered that no public pronouncement should be made with regard to the present Protocol, and saw no objection to a delay in giving our answer.SIR PHILIP LLOYD-GREAME pointed out that all discussions which had taken place at Geneva were based on the assumption that Germany would shortly become a Member of the League of Nations. The various arguments which he had put forward in his Memorandum (C.I.D. Paper No. 536-B) were chiefly framed on the assumption that the United States was not-a Member of the League; but these arguments would, in a degree varying with its productive capacity, apply to Germany and any other large manufacturing country which was not a party to the Protocol.LORD CURZON agreed that it was desirable to continue the discussion at a later meeting. He pointed out that the Committee of Imperial Defence would eventually be required to tender advice to the Government on the subject of the Protocol. It was evident that, at an early stage, it would be necessary to consult the Governments of the Dominions. He wished, before the next meeting, to give careful consideration to the suggestion that a Sub-Committee should be formed to consider the questions of principle involved. He called attention to the statement made by Sir Samuel Hoare to the effect that we had knocked out each scheme that had been put forward by the League of Nations. First of all the Treaties of Mutual Guarantee, secondly, the Treaties of Mutual Assistance, and now the Protocol. It was quite clear that, after consultation with the Dominions, it would not be sufficient merely to reply bo the League of Nations that the British Empire did not like the Protocol. He was of the opinion that the question must be studied in its widest aspects, since it was evident that the constitution of the League of Nations itself was imperfect. We were anxious for Germany to become a Member of the League, but for first one reason and then another she had not done so. In regard to the desirability of Russia joining the League, at this moment he would express no opinion, but in the long run all great States ought to be included. The discussion, however, appeared to him to open up wider possibilities than had yet been touched upon. Ought we not to consider whether we should frame principles as to our attitude towards the League and its development in a shape which might form a basis for an International Conference on the subject, with a view to putting the League on a sounder footing ? He considered that the present moment offered an opportunity for a stroke of policy which might have far-reaching effects. In considering the appointment of a special Sub-Committee, he hoped that the Committee of Imperial Defence would not set aside the desirability of entrusting to it, besides the Geneva Protocol, the consideration of our future attitude towards the Covenant and the League of Nations. As Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence he undertook ,before the next meeting to formulate some proposals.LORD CECIL suggested that at some stage of the enquiry it might be desirable to invite certain distinguished gentlemen who were not members of the present Government, such as the late Prime Minister, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, Lord Grey, Mr. Asquith and Mr. Lloyd George, to take part in the deliberations on this question, in order that the line of policy to be adopted might be framed on a national rather than a party basis. He did not ask for an immediate decision with regard to this suggestion, but requested the Committee to bear it in mind for consideration at some later date.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, December 4, 1924.

ARBITRATION, SECURITY AND REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS.Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes.(Previous Reference,:! C.I.D. Minutes of 191st Meeting, Minute 10.)(Stenographic Note.)PRIME MINISTER: We are very glad to see you back, Foreign Secretary, and congratulate you very warmly upon the result of your tour. We had a Meeting, as you may be aware, at which you were unable to be present, when we ran over the ground of the Protocol, and, as you have very probably seen, the Lord President of the Council gave us an admirably clear summary of the whole situation; he had been through all the documents on the subject from all the Departments. Not having had the advantage of your presence last time, I think it will be most useful to the Committee if you would be good enough to begin by telling us the. result of your contact with Prime Ministers abroad and how the problem presents itself to you at this moment.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Prime Minister, may I first of all thank you for your welcome to. me.May I next say that I am working under considerable pressure, and that to-day, as yesterday, I have been unable to prepare my statement; I have to make it without notes, and, therefore, it will perhaps not be as neat or as connected as I should like it to be, or as the very able summary with which Lord Curzon opened your proceedings the other day. But I thought that it would be of use to my colleagues at this early stage if I, with the memory of my conversations fresh in my mind, gave some account of what passed between the Foreign statesmen and myself on this subject.I will first take Belgium, if I may, because Belgium came before the others in point of time. I have circulated to this Committee a Memorandum left with me by the Belgian Ambassador and drawn up by the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs, M- Hymans. I saw M. Hymans in Rome, and he practically had nothing to add to his Memorandum, but only desired to emphasise it. What, then, is the position of Belgium ? I conceive it to be this, that Belgium must follow in the wake of France m matters of this kind; that she is not wholly comfortable in being so much in the hands of France, and would infinitely prefer her old position of being under a guarantee by France and, the British Empire instead of merely in a treaty alliance with France. But she cannot afford not to show enthusiasm for the Protocol. It would, however, be a complete mistake to suppose that if we signed the Protocol as it stands, with other Powers, we have heard the last of the question of Security so far as Belgium is concerned. She would be on our doorstep the next day asking for a supplementary pact of some kind which linked France, Belgium and ourselves. It is that to which she really attaches importance. She values it infinitely more than the Protocol, and I think that she is not without anxiety as to the obligation under which the Protocol would put her in regard to Eastern Europe.Then I come to France. France is pledged to the Protocol. v I think not only M. Herriot&apos;&apos;s Government, but any Government that might succeed M. Herriofs Government, would equally ratify the Protocol. They feel that they cannot afford to do otherwise. They feel that by ratifying the Protocol they put themselves right with the public opinion of the world and are morally reinforced. Of course, it is of great consequence to them they have undertaken treaties with some of the East Central Powers that the obligations which are now theirs should be shared by Powders which at present are not committed by them. One can see their very obvious and direct interest in securing the guarantee, especially of the great States, to the integrity of Poland, of Czecho-Slovakia, and indeed to the Eastern frontier of Europe, to the defence of which they are already committed, and which would be rendered easier for them if the British Empire came in to share their liability. But, again, in the case of France it would be, I think, a complete mistake to suppose that we should have settled the question of Security if we accepted the Protocol as it stands. I put the question directly to M. Herriot, but he did not give me a direct answer : &quot; We cannot have too many securities; France, of course, would like to get every guarantee that she could,&quot; and so forth. But this was amplified to my Private Secretary, when we passed through Paris on our way back, by M. Bergerie, the Chef de Cabinet of M. Herriot, who said in effect : &quot;Of course we are going to sign the Protocol; it is going to.establish our moral position in Europe; but of course we want as its natural concomitant a tripartite arrangement with Belgium and Great Britain,&quot;
When I saw Signor Mussolini he said what I have observed he has since said in public that if other Powers had signed, Italy would have signed, but with reservations. He said to me that it seemed impossible to submit every question that might arise to compulsory arbitration. There was a class of questions which were so vital to a State, in her honour or in her existence, that she never could or would submit them to arbitration, and that, therefore, he would have made reservations. What he would like to see done was to make a list of the questions suitable for compulsory arbitration and see whether it could not be extended by name still further, but not to give a guarantee, which in fact no State could afford to give or, when given, to keep.I then come to a conversation which I had with M. Briand. He was very anxious to see me in Rome, and the Ambassador was good enough to ask him to lunch, and after lunch we went aside and had a long talk. He said to me : &quot; Cannot you tell me rather more about the attitude of the British Government ? &quot; I replied that I really was not in a position to say anything about the attitude of the British Government; the truth was so simple that I found it difficult to make anybody believe it; but the whole truth was that at the moment I left home there had been no discussion among Ministers on this subject; we had not had time; the first preliminary discussion among Ministers had actually taken place on the day I left London, or was to take place the next day. All that I could say to him was that at the moment I, personally, saw the difficulties of any conceivable course, whether of accepting the Protocol, of rejecting it, of amending it, or of substituting something else for it. I saw almost equal difficulties in any course, and I had not at the moment, even in my own mind, any solution to propose to my colleagues; still less did I know what might be in their minds. &quot; Well,&apos;&apos; he said, &quot; what are the kind of difficulties which you yourself see in the Protocol? &quot; I replied, &quot; Well, here is one, M. Briand. Does it not seem to you that there are some questions so vital to the existence of a State, that, whatever document it may have signed, it will never submit them, to arbitration because an adverse decision would be the end of the State; and even if it had signed a document compelling it to submit those questions to arbitration, do you think that it would submit to the award, if it was adverse, without fighting? &quot; He said that evidently there were questions of such vital consequence to a State that it always would fight whatever document it had signed. Then I said, &apos;&apos; There is another difficulty which I foresee. It was put to me by the Swedish Representative on the Council, who had come to me and said, &apos; My Government are in some anxiety about this Protocol. Supposing there were an attack by Russia on Lithuania, is the League going to call upon Sweden to send troops to Lithuania? &apos; &quot; I said to him, &quot; Evidently that is one of the class of questions which those of us who have not decided whether to sign or not must consider very carefully. Clearly, your Army is. most conveniently situated for the purpose. No doubt they might call upon the French Navy and our own to send some ships. We could, do it with the least inconvenience because we are both very far removed from the Russian frontier and it would be difficult for them to turn the attack from an attack upon Lithuania into an attack upon us; but the very fact that your proximity makes your Army the most convenient obviously places you in the most exposed position, and it is quite true, as you say (I was putting words into his mouth), that having gone at the behest of the League to defend Lithuania, you might find that the only result was that when your Army was in Lithuania, Russia changed the front of attack and that it would become Finland and SAveden.&quot; M. Briand said, &quot;Yes.&quot;Then, as I think I have recorded in the conversations circulated to my colleagues - they were made in much haste amd I am not certain how complete they were  I gave M. Briand what- I may call my personal history in regard to this question. I said that I had personally urged upon Lord Grey before the War that the Entente had all the obligations of an alliance without its advantages, and that I had been in favour of making an alliance with France at that time and publishing it to the world; that I had been in favour of the Anglo-American Pact of Guarantee, and that I regretted that even when America fell out we had not at once validated our guarantee irrespective of America; that I had been a ..member of the Government which at the time of the Cannes Conference was prepared to make a Pact of Guarantee, and that I profoundly regretted for the sake of our two countries and of the world that an upheaval in France had prevented those negotiations coming to any result. M. Briand, who, of course, was the Minister who was overturned, said he could only say that he shared my view and that it was a realisation of the folly of the decision taken in Paris at that moment to[12426] &apos; b 2
render null the negotiations at Cannes, and of the consequences that followed from it later, which had done more than anything else to upset the Poincare&apos; regime. I said that I told him this merely that he might know my personal attitude and the spirit in which I approached these questions; but I added that just as it would have been more difficult to give the guarantee without America when she fell out than ^ it would have been to give the guarantee with her, so it would have been infinitely more difficult to carry the Cannes Pact; there would have been much less unanimity of opinion here and in the British Empire at that time than there would have been at the time of the Versailles Conferences, and that the lapse of time afterwards worked against the undertaking: of obligations of this kind. Obviously, the British Empire in a matter of this kind must have one policy. The support which we gave depended upon the union of the Empire, not only at home but in the Dominions; we had probably moved steadily further and further away from the&apos; temper of 1918, and Avhat might have been possible at an earlier time was much more difficult now.   That is all I said to him.- LORD CECIL : Did he make any reply to all that?Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : No; he thanked me, but he did not comment upon it. He did not comment on it, but he then developed the French point of view at considerable length, not adding anything of substance&apos; to what I have already said to this Committee.Later I saw M..Benes. M. Benes was at one point the go-between in finding, or attempting to find, the formula which united M. Herriot and Mr. Ramsay MacDonald after their first divergent speeches at Geneva. He gave me an account of how he had worked all day and all night, and then the English said &quot; This won&apos;t do, that won&apos;t do, and the other won&apos;t do&quot;; and then the French had said &quot; This, that, and the other won&apos;t do,&quot; and how he then set to work again, and how eventually, as I understood from him, being quite ignorant of what had happened, he had successfully solved the knot. I understand from other people that, in fact, he never did solve it, and that in the end the English and the French got together, as perhaps they would better have got together at first, and that they made a formula which he had been unable to make. At that point I interrupted him to say &quot;Well, M. Benes. in the very slight study that I have been able to give this question up to the present time, it has seemed to me that even at the moment when M. ITerriot and Mr. Ramsay MacDonald thought themselves most agreed, there was a profound difference of principle between them.&quot; He said &quot;Ah ! you noticed that! &quot; Well, now what was that? It was, I think, that whereas Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s whole conception of the Protocol, or of any Protocol, was that it ought to be in lieu of any unilateral, bilateral or subsidiary and supplementary agreements, in the eyes of the French it was always a document to be preceded, accompanied or followed by a series of local alliances. That, of course, is a profound difference of principle.M. Benes went on to tell me that he was a Czechoslovakian, that the position of. Czechoslovakia was one of some anxiety and that the Protocol was thoroughly satisfactory from the Czechoslovakian point of view, but that it was of course important to do nothing that might deter America from entering the League or postpone the moment at which she might enter the League, and that he conceived the solution might be that there should be, as it were, regional Protocols; there might be an American Protocol as well as a European Protocol. I observed that this was a very interesting suggestion, but had M. Benes at all considered the point of view of an Empire which was both an American and European Empire ? He said that he fully recognised the peculiarity of our position, but he did not come provided with any suggestion to meet it. I said to him, and I think to some others, it is obvious that those Powers that have already declared themselves as being ready to sign, will sign in some cases with expressed reservations; it is possible that in other cases they will sign with mental reservations; with the mental reservations we cannot deal, but if it is at all likely that expressed reservations would be numerous, is it not worth considering whether a document signed by different Powers, each or many of them putting in different reservations, is really the best solution that we can obtain? Would it not be better in such circumstances that we should reduce the document to one on which we could agree, and have a clear code before us for the contingencies which may arise? What is the position going to be? If Italy signs Avith four or five reservations; if Swednn signs with reservations; if various other Powers sign with reservations, when the case of action arises, when you want to put in force the sanctions of the League, you can no longer look at the Protocol to
see either what are anyone&apos;s obligations or what the authority of the League is. You may find that the Protocol says so and so, but that does not apply to Italy and this does not apply to Sweden, and in the end you might quiet possibly find, when you have taken account of all these reservations, that there is no unanimity in fact, that the great machinery which you have created turns out to be useless. M. Benes said he appreciated the difficulty, but what really mattered to Czechoslovakia was that Germany should not go to war. If France and England were united by a Treaty of Guarantee, Germany would not go to war and there would be no Avar in the East of Europe. So that there again you come back to this idea that the Protocol by itself is insufficient and that a Franco-British Pact really gives to Europe, and gives more effectively to Europe, the security which the Protocol affects to provide.Now I hope 1 have fairly^ summarised the impressions produced and the information given me from these conversations. I think it is all of actual substance that passed. But I am left with a profound sense of the importance of the decision we have to take, and a great anxiety to find the right solution. The dominant feature in the outlook of Europe to-day is, I think, fear.LORD CECIL: I quite agree.Mb. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : And fear is the worst counsellor that a Government can have. Unless in some way we can allay those fears, I think the policy of irritation will go on, the policy of revenge will go on; the Germans have not the sense not to say, as Gambetta said of Alsace-Lorraine, &quot; Think of it always, but never talk of it &quot;; they will talk of it as well as think of it. If you can get security I think provocations will cease to a large extent. I think the policy of France will become reasonable, that there will be a great alleviation of the situation, and that time might be given to^ Europe to produce those new conditions in which the past becomes the past and is no longer the present, and when nations accept the situation with which they are confronted. To illustrate my meaning, take the attitude of France about 1900. A French friend of mine, not by profession a politician but very interested in politics, and owing to his circumstances, moving in many different French circles, told me about the time of Agadir that a few years previously, say about 1900, to his generation, which was the generation of the war of 1870, the attitude of the youth of France was saddening in the extreme. They no longer thought of Alsace-Lorraine as a possible reconquest for France, they said, &quot;After all there must be an end; fate went against us; it is risking too much to reopen the question.&quot; He said, if the Germans would only cease to throw stones into our garden, they would have had it all their own way, but they never would let us alone. When I met my friends a year or two ago at the time of one of these provocations and said, &quot; Weil, what now ? &quot; they shrugged their shoulders and said, &quot; Eh bien, que voulez-vous ? &quot; Now they throw up their heads and ask indignantly,&quot; Est-ce qua 9a ne fmit pas ? There is an entirely different spirit, and it is because the Germans never will let us alone.&quot; That is what I am afraid of in the Europe of to-day, and unless we can make our policy, the policy of the British Empire, such as to give Europe a feeling of security, then, not in my time, but sooner or later, I think there will be another European war. Therefore, though I have read the short discussion you had the other day with agreement in the general opinions that were expressed, I come to you to-day to say that to&apos; turn down the Protocol, or to decide to turn down the Protocol, is quite the easiest of the decisions that we have to take, and that act by itself, unaccompanied by anything else, would, in my opinion, be an absolute disaster. I have got one suggestion that I should like to make, but I think I will not make it at this moment because that really concludes the tale I have to tell, and I will now answer any questions if my colleagues wish to put them, and I shall be glad to hear their observations.THE PRIME MINISTER : I am very much obliged to you for your statement. It has been of enormous interest. I think I may say I do not know whether I am speaking for everybody here there was a general feeling during the last discussion that the direct turning down of the Protocol would only open the door to fresh difficulties. I do not think any of us felt it was possible to do that until we had something to put in its place.LORD CECIL : I have only two observations to make at the present stage with regard to the statement which has been.made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I am in complete agreement with the remarks which he made with regard to the necessity of getting rid of fear from the minds of the people of European
countries. The present situation appears to me to be fraught with much greater difficulty that that which existed after the war of 1870. The Germans, although defeated in the late war, are now far stronger than the French were after the war of 1870, and will grow stronger still. It appears to me, therefore, that there is less probability of the Germans accepting the present situation. I entirely agree with the view expressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the adoption by the British Empire of a purely negative attitude towards the Protocol would be a disaster. If in the view of the Government it is impossible to accept the Protocol in its present form, should not we aim at revising the terms of this Protocol in preference to rejecting it completely and substituting something new in its place?LORD CURZON : It appears from the statement which has been made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that while the Committee of Imperial Defence were commencing the preliminary work of investigating the question of the Protocol, the Foreign Secretary has been carrying out much more important work abroad, in as much as he has been able to ascertain the attitude which is likely to be adopted by the various7Powers towards this subject. Take the case of Belgium. So far from being satisfied with the Protocol if we all signed it and it came into operation, she would require or would desire a Pact of Guarantee from us just as strongly, perhaps even more strongly, than she did when I was concerned with the matter two or three years ago. Then Mr. Chamberlain went on to France, and he had conversations at different periods, as he has told us, both with the Prime Minister, M. Herriot, and later, as I understand, with M. Briand. It emerged from his conversations with the former that, equally with Belgium, France would not be content with the Protocol if accepted, but that she also would want an independent Pact of Guarantee from ourselves. Then Mr. Chamberlain goes to Italy, and he ascertains there, as I gather from his circulated account of the interview, that Signor Mussolini is really rather suspicious of the Protocol; the whole bent of the man&apos;s mind, as I recall very well from my own conversations with him, is hostile to this sort of thing, because it interferes with his own conceptions and also with his own execution when the time for execution arrives. Accordingly, the critical attitude that he adopts is, taking one section of the Protocol (that relating to compulsory arbitration), to say at once : &quot; But all sorts of reservations will have to be mada on behalf of Italy, and no doubt you will have yours, too.&quot; Believe me, those criticisms, which, as I understand, he confined to the clauses dealing with compulsory arbitration, we should probably find later on that he applied equally to other parts of the Protocol, as, indeed, we should have to do ourselves.Then the Foreign Secretary has a talk with that universal solver of all situations, M. Benes, and he appears to have succeeded in doing what I never did, namely, to have floored M. Benes by a very pertinent question. M. Benes sees the dangers as well as we do, and the Foreign Secretary succeeded in driving him into a corner where he had to admit, looking at the matter through the spectacles of Eastern Europe and Czechoslovakia, that he, too, even if the Protocol was signed, would feel that security could only be given by a Pact. Therefore it comes to this : all these eminent men want to get both the Protocol, in the first place, and the Pact, in the second. I do not go further in criticising that attitude now, but, at any rate, we must bear it in mind in the way in which we view the matter.Then the Foreign Secretary ended with what, if I may say so, was a very powerful appeal, which we all cordially re-echo, as to the impossibility of rejecting this Protocol straight away and substituting nothing for it. I think he was right in saying that it would be extraordinarily easy to reject it straight away, because the thing is so full of flaws and absurdities and impossibilities that to knock it down would be as easy as to knock down a castle of cards. But, whether you look at it from the point of view of the feeling in Europe, which he describes as a feeling of fear, or from the point of view of public opinion at home, clearly we should shock the world and shock our own public very considerably if we simply knocked it down and substituted nothing in its place.Let me pause for a moment to consider the question of what in all probability this Committee would be well advised to do during the next few weeks, starting from the premise which the Foreign Secretary has just laid down. The situation is largely governed by conditions of time, and to some extent by conditions of convenience. &apos; By &quot; time &quot; I mean this, that Parliament will meet again, as I understand, on the 10th February; that the next meeting of the League of Nations, where there has been a sort of conditional undertaking that this matter will be discussed, will be in March, and that the Foreign Secretary will attend somewhere about the 22nd March..
Conditions of convenience are those that arise from the imminence of the holidays and other engagements.The first point we have to take is what we are to say and do to our Dominions. We are under a direct obligation to them to consult them, and, if the necessity arises, even to confer with them upon this matter. As regards consultation, I understand from the Secretary that what has passed so far is this : All the papers that have been circulated to us, that is to say, the Reports of the various Departments, the Chiefs of Staff, and so on, have been sent in the ordinary course to them. They are now upon the sea, and they will reach the furthest of them, New Zealand, in a period of five or six weeks from now. I think it might be desirable to send them at the same time the report of our meeting of ten. days ago, which really was a sort of summary of the criticisms that had been prepared by the Departments; and I should like to add a suggestion that the account of to-day&apos;s important meeting, with the all-important speech of the Foreign Secretary, should also be sent. Even if that is done, New Zealand will not get the whole of the papers until six weeks from now. That takes us to the 20th January. Parliament meets in the second week in February. I must ask the Colonial Secretary about this. Does he not think it would be the best plan to ask them to consider these papers of course, except in the case of New Zealand, the difficulty does not arise and to favour us by telegram or despatch with a general and preliminary opinion upon them before the opening of Parliament 1 That would give us their general views as a guidance to us, and it would also enable them to say, what, no doubt, they will wish to say, whether they do or do not consider a personal conference necessary. We should then, at any rate, be able to say something about the Dominions to Parliament, and we should have satisfied them by telling them everything we know already and taking them into consultation, not at an advanced stage, but at the first stage.Then as regards our procedure here and here come in the conditions of convenience to which I just now referred it will be difficult, and, indeed,.I think, impossible, during the next three or four weeks to get this question considered bv Ministers themselves. Quite apart from other reasons, I will give you two in particular. Lord Cecil, whose co-operation with us, if I may say so, is very important and helpful, is himself going to America to-morrow and will be away for some weeks.LORD CECIL :  It will be three weeks.LORD CURZON : I saw Lord Balfour two or three days ago, and he is also leaving London to-day and cannot be back until the early part of January. Other Ministers will also require to be absent from London during the next few weeks. What is it that we want to do 1 I suppose we may present the problem in two ways : firstly, we want to see whether, by amendments or reservations, or by any other plan that suggests itself, the existing Protocol can be brought into a shape which, as regards ourselves, will meet the very powerful criticisms that have been directed against it. Whether that amendment and adjustment should be done by taking the Protocol article by article and attempting to re-write it, or whether it should be done by leaving intact portions which are relatively harmless, and endeavouring to re-write the remainder, or whatever other suggestion may present itself, it would be premature here to say; but I think that that work ought to be undertaken, and undertaken without delay. It may be that, in the course of that enquiry, those who make it, subject to the opinions of Ministers afterwards, would decide that the difficulty of proceeding in that way was so great that it would be desirable to lay down new principles and to proceed upon new lines. There may be a good deal to be said for that, but for the moment that is not the question that I venture to present to the Committee. My suggestion is this, and I have talked it over with some of my colleagues and with the Secretary, though I have not had the advantage of seeing the Foreign Secretary about it because of his necessary preoccupations. The plan I would suggest is this, that we should constitute a Sub-Committee consisting of representatives of the different Departments, preferably the Under-Secretaries, to examine the whole body of criticism that has been offered by the Experts. For instance, the Foreign Office would, under such a scheme, be represented I hope by Sir Eyre Crowe, who would state their point of view. The Colonial Office would be represented by whomever Mr. Amery might choose to send, and the same with the other Departments. I think it ought to be the most responsible officials in the Departments. I would not suggest that upon this Sub-Committee the Experts should sit; I would not suggest that Lord Beatty and Lord Cavan should sit, because
the object of the Sub-Committee would be to examine their proposals and their criticisms; and that then this Committee, if the idea be favoured here, should be asked to report early in January, ; about the time that we are able to reassemble, when Lord Cecil gets back and Lord Balfour gets back, and so on, and that we should then sit here to examine what they have to say. We should then be in a better position to decide on what lines to proceed. Talking over the matter with Sir Maurice Hankey it is always better to put a suggestion into concrete shape we thought that if the kind of idea that I suggest were found acceptable, we might submit some such resolution as this to the Committee of Imperial Defence to-day : &quot; That an Inter-Departmental Committee composed as follows &quot; and here I may say in passing I think it would probably be the desire of the Committee and probably of the Foreign Secretary himself, that Sir Eyre Crowe, with his great authority, should &quot;preside over the proceedings of such a Committee, and of course Sir Maurice Ffankey is absolutely essential &quot; That an Interdepartmental Committee, composed as follows : &quot; , (in the Chair).&apos;&apos; Representatives of -&quot; Foreign Office,&quot;Admiralty,&quot;War Office,&quot;Air Ministry,&quot;Colonel Office,&quot; India Office,&apos;&apos; Joint Secretaries from the Foreign Office and Committee of Imperial Defence,&apos;&apos; with power to invite representatives of other Departments if necessary, should meet to consider, and to report not later than (?) Saturday, the 10th January, 1925:-&quot; (i.) How far the Geneva Protocol on the subject of Arbitration, Security and Limitation of Armaments, is susceptible of being amended to meet the criticisms that have been passed upon it, and, alternatively,&quot; (ii.) What are the principles which should be adopted if it should be desired to substitute some other instrument for the Protocol ?&quot;May I say upon the latter point, Mr. Chamberlain, what was only hinted at ten days ago when you were absent? One of the main difficulties about the Protocol in its present form is, as you know, that America is unfortunately hostile to the League as it now exists, and that hostility is likely to be aggravated rather than diminished by the Protocol, and there are other large considerations into which I need not enter now. It may well be as we proceed with the examination of the Protocol, adjusting it, and pulling it about, in the not only difficult but almost impossible conditions of the case, we may come to the conclusion that if carried out it would land us in still further trouble. A situation might then arise in which we should look at the whole thing afresh and endeavour, in consultation with America and the Dominions, to lay down certain principles upon which we could all agree and which might really revolutionise the whole position. So far from upsetting the Covenant, we might even fortify and reaffirm it with the consent of America and others. That is perhaps an aspiration for the moment rather than anything else; but it is the meaning of the suggestion that the Committee, if we appoint it, should not only sit down and work upon the text, but in the course of it should consider whether, as their examination proceeds, if they find it very difficult to amend, they might suggest certain basic principles consistent with the Covenant upon which it might be possible for all of us to agree and which might cover a wider area. That is the form of proposal that has been tentatively drawn up and which I venture to submit to the Committee.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN: May I say a little more? I want in the first place to supplement the account I gave of my Conversations abroad, and it is pertinent to the observations with which Lord Curzon concluded. Mr. Fletcher, the American Ambassador in Rome, told our Ambassador that he was anxious to see me. He came on the same day that M. Briand did and the result was that I had very little time to give him.   But he managed within five
minutes to jump with both feet on the Protocol and to say that he had recently seen Secretary of State Hughes, with whom, I was informed, he was on intimate terms, and that Mr. Hughes had been greatly relieved when he saw the request of Great Britain for a postponement, as he viewed, not without anxiety, the possibility that the United States might be declared an aggressor&quot; under the Protocol on some occasion and the sanctions endeavoured to be enforced against her. At first I attached a good deal of importance to that conversation because I was told that he was an intimate friend of Mr. Hughes and that he was not unlikely to be appointed Ambassador to this Court. But then my experience is that every American Ambassador is always in expectation that his intimate relations with the Secretary of State will cause him to be sent to London on the next vacancy. I have since been told that Mr. Fletcher has from the first adopted an attitude of marked hostility to the League and must be considered as a prejudiced witness. He was responsible at the State Department for giving instructions that no communication from the League was to be answered-an instruction which ruled for eight or nine months and then broke down over some matter like the Arms Traffic or the Protection of Women and Children, in which opinion in America was obviously interested and where they were not content to be left wholly outside. Later I saw Mr. Arthur Sweetser, an American in the Secretariat of the League. He is all out for the League. He gave me .a different account of Mr, Hughes&apos; attitude, saying that of course America was not coming into the League; there were things in the Protocol that were contrary to American policy, but indicating, also as a result of a private and intimate conversation which he had recently held with Mr, Hughes, that Mr. Hughes viewed it with the most benevolent attitude as probably a very good thing for other people though not congenial to the Constitution of the United States. I really have not, therefore, any clear idea of what Mr. Hughes&apos;s mind is. If the Committee approves, I propose to write either a despatch or a private letter to Sir Esme Howard asking him to get me any information that he can, saying that of course we have no idea whatever that America is coming into the League at any time that we can contemplate, but would the adoption of the Protocol make the League more hateful to the United States or do they take any interest in the fate of the Protocol or in any provisions of it ?   I think that would be a good thing to do.There is one further observation I should like to make supplementing what I originally said. I think that in my conversation with M. Briand, when talking about what I have called my personal history in regard to the question of Alliances, I said : &quot;You know, if I were a member of the Opposition desirous of opening an attack upon Mr. Ramsay MacDonald in the position of a Prime Minister defending this Protocol, what I should say to him at once is that you refuse to do for France what you are engaging to do for Lithuania and Bessarabia. I think our people understand that the Channel is a British interest. I think that before the war they had come to understand that the defence of the Channel was not on our Coasts, but on the seas, and I hope the war showed them that it was not even on the seas, but on the Eastern frontier of France and the countries bordering on the Channel. But I think I should have some difficulty in persuading them that it was on the Eastern frontier of Europe.&quot; At any rate, that is, as it seems to me, an obvious criticism of the Protocol-Ahat it involves us in fact in all the obligations to Bessarabia and Lithuania, to take two threatened points in the extreme East of Europe, when those who support it say that it is impossible that we should undertake .a similar guarantee for the Eastern frontiers of the countries bordering on the Channel.May I add that I welcome Lord Curzon&apos;s proposal about this Committee of Enquiry. I think it would be very desirable that, in the light of the criticisms that have been made, such a Committee should be set up to try and make the Protocol, either by excision or inclusion, conform to those criticisms so that we might know in the first place whether that was possible, and, if it was possible, what was the document that resulted, and then look at it again.Obviously, I should like Sir Eyre Crowe to sit upon the Committee, but, subject to the concurrence of the Prime Minister and Lord Curzon, I should like to spare him the onerous work of the Chair, which really means a good deal of work between the meetings, as we all know. I think it would fee a good thing if on this occasion we might put Sir Maurice Hankey in the Chair and let him find a Secretary from his staff. That would be agreeable to Sir Eyre Crowe, who would be glad to haye the relief.LORD CURZON:  I suggested that, but it was negatived by Sir Maurice Hankey himself.[12426] c
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN : I put that forward, and for the reason that I think it is impossible for me to ask Sir Eyre Crowe to undertake the additional duties that fall upon the Chairman as apart from an influential member of the Committee.THE PRIME MINISTER : I am not surprised.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Then I wanted to make a brief allusion to an observation made by Lord Curzon when you met last week, when he expressed a little anxiety about the date of March. I was confronted with an atmosphere of some suspicion in the Council. If I had asked for anything more than an adjournment to March, with a co-relative adjournment of all the subsequent dates, I do not think I should have got it. I believe the Members of the Council would have taken that as indicating so hostile an attitude on our part that they would have proceeded, in the way of preliminary enquiries, to get more and more committed without even waiting for March. That was the most I could ask for. I said: &quot;I ask for a simple adjournment of three months in all dates, to enable the British Government to come to a decision.&quot; We may not be able to come to a final decision in March, but I think the British delegate to the March Council must be in a position to give a very considerable indication of the mind of the British Empire, and I hope that we shall do our utmost to get Dominion consultation as early as possible. I should like very much, before we go to the Council Meeting in March, to be in a position to hold some preliminary conversations with France and Italy. I think the root difficulty with which we are confronted is that a Parliament of all the nations of the world undertook to do in Parliament what we would not undertake to do in the House of Commons of one country in regard to a domestic Bill of any consequence, and that the proper procedure would have been for the French, the Belgians, then or later the Italians, and ourselves, to have got together to have hammered out resolutions, taken those resolutions to the Assembly, and then, if they were approved by the Assembly, set up a drafting body, again with freedom of talk among ourselves, and to- go to a later Assembly with a considered document. I should like very much to be in a position before we go to the March Council to talk with our principal Allies in the late war.One other suggestion I want to make for consideration. I think it was made by Lord Cecil at the last meeting; at any rate, it was mentioned by somebody. I feel that this is the most prodigious issue that we have to decide, and the most prodigious issue that lies before Europe, and, indeed, the world, at this moment. I have already said that it is essential that we should have an Empire policy and not half-a-dozen different policies within the Empire. Here, at home, we want it to be a national policy as well, and I do- think that probably at some stage, and not too late a stage, of our discussions, we should be wise to invite one or two repre-sentatives of other parties, say Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and Lord Haldane, some-body from the Liberal Party, Mr. Asquith or Mr. Lloyd George  or whoever their people might be to join in our deliberations.LORD CECIL : I said I was not going to ask for any immediate decision.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I do not ask for a decision on the other matter to-day, but I want it considered, and I want it considered because, just as Lord Curzon has said of the Committee which he proposes, that he does not propose to ask Lord Cavan and Lord Beatty and Sir Hugh Trenchard to sit on it at this stage, so I think that before we trouble our military, naval and Air Force people much further we have got to give them the political basis on which they are to work. We have got their views on the general question and they cannot probably go further we should merely waste their time by asking them to go further until we ourselves, the Cabinet of the country, are able to give them indications. If we know what we want we can then say to them : &quot; What is necessary to carry this out from your point of view, and what are the objections, if any, to it from your point of view? &quot; It is no good asking them to roam at large over an infinite number of possibilities until we have given them the political basis of the technical questions that they have to examine.Mr. AMERY: While accepting Lord Curzon&apos;s resolution I should like to suggest at the end of it that the phrase &quot; alternative instrument &quot; is not quite sufficient.  I think it ought to be &quot; alternative policy.&quot;With regard to Dominion consultation, I cannot imagine this question can be settled by correspondence alone. Not only is the Protocol in itself of considerable importance, but you cannot really dismiss it without frankly facing the attitude of the British Empire to the League of Nations and the present Covenant of the League.
These things are of such immense importance that you can only settle them by a direct Conference between the Governments of the Empire face to face. If we had unlimited time I have no doubt the best thing, would be to send out these various documents, to invite (by despatch) the Governments to- suggest to us when we should have a Conference, to have a Conference some time in the summer or next autumn, and out of that Conference then to emerge with our view to Europe. I gather from the Foreign Secretary that the other Governments of Europe would be amazed if we suggested that some time towards the end of next&apos; year we should be prepared with our views. It therefore seems to me that a situation has arisen in which we ought to telegraph to the Dominions at once that the time-table, from the point of view of the Foreign Secretary, is of such great importance that we ought to urge them to try and make it possible whether the Prime Ministers or other Ministers  to attend a Conference here not later than March. I do not think we can get it earlier than March, because I do not ffiink you can get the Australian and New Zealand Ministers to leave on the day after they get the telegram, and you must allow six weeks before their arrival. I think you might perhaps get them to come by the end of February or the beginning of March.LORD CURZON : Do you mean before they see the papers that we send out ?Mr. AMERY : They would have to risk that, and have extra copies sent to meet them- those at the greatest distance. Australia would pick them up half-way, at Colombo, and so on. I have had a note which tells me that it is not unlikely that the Australian House of Representatives will postpone its first meeting until the beginning of June. In that case an earlier date than March would be possible for Mr. Bruce to come over here; and attend the Conference.PRIME MINISTER : Do you- think Mr. Bruce would come himself ?Mr. AMERY : He might leave his Treasurer, Mr. Page, to carry on for the first week or two in Parliament, and then get back soon after his Parliament has opened.LORD BIRKENHEAD : I will not say anything at this stage except that I am in agreement with Lord Curzon&apos;s proposal that a Committee should be formed. I do not think it would be useful to discuss the main question. But whatever the effect in Europe may be, I do not think there is the slightest prospect that we shall reach a conclusion in March. We have a document of this kind we shall begin to discuss it with the Representatives of the Dominions, if we are lucky, in the first week in March. They will have only just got their papers; they will require time for consideration, and they will want time for consultation with their Governments. I think it will be quite impossible. I think the difficulties in the way of the Protocol are overwhelming, and I do not think we can make a document to convey at all the policy of this country.SIR SAMUEL FIOARE : I agree with the procedure suggested, but there is a point I want to mention. I was struck with what Mr. Chamberlain said just now about it being mainly a political question. I wondered really whether in this Inter-Departmental Committee you would want the Service Departments at all. I say that because so far, at any rate, in my own Department, it is the Staff that has been dealing with questions of this kind. If you do- not have the Chief of Staff on the Committee, presumably you will have the Secretary of the Department, who knows nothing at all about it. He is not dealing with questions of this kind. I should have thought really that, if so, it would have been better to have had a small Drafting Committee really it is mainly that. composed of Sir Maurice Hankey, Sir Eyre Crowe and Sir Cecil Hurst, or something of that kind, with power to call in the other Departments. I should have thought it would have got the work done much more quickly in that way, and you would not then call in people who, at the present moment, know nothing at all about it and whose Departments are not dealing with it.(The remainder of the discussion is from long-hand notes.)SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER suggested that it was more convenient to keep the Committee as small as possible. He considered that the Committee would sometimes be discussing the purely military aspects of the Protocol and sometimes the economic aspects. He suggested, therefore, that when military subjects were under discussion the Committee should have power to summon [12426] d
representatives of the Fighting Departments to sit as members, and that when economic questions were under consideration representatives from the Board of Trade and Treasury should be summoned to attend as Members.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN suggested that the Committee should consist of Sir Maurice Hankey, Sir Eyre Crowe, and representatives of the Colonial Office and India Office, and that Sir Cecil Hurst and representatives of other Departments should be summoned as required for discussion of subjects which particularly affected their Departments.SIR SAMUEL HO ARE expressed the opinion that since the Committee appeared to be primarily a drafting Committee that it should be kept as small as possible. -LORD CURZON pointed out that the functions of the Committee would be much larger than those of a purely drafting Committee. It might be found that it was impossible to amend the present Protocol on lines which would be acceptable to all the Departments, and the Committee would, therefore, require to frame alternative proposals of principle, and even perhaps to outline a new Protocol or a new Covenant of the League of Nations.Mr. AMERY suggested that when the suggested Committee had completed its labours it might be desirable that the question should be further examined by a Committee consisting of Ministerial Members.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that it was impossible to reach a definite conclusion on the proposal put forward by Mr. Amery at the present stage. Such a proposal could only be considered when the suggested Sub-Committee had completed its task and the Committee of Imperial Defence had had an opportunity of examining the result of its investigations.LORD CECIL stated that, whilst realising the difficulties which the Foreign Secretary had experienced at Geneva with, regard, to the postponement of the discussion of the Protocol by the Council of the League of Nations, he considered that conversations should commence as early as possible with the various leading Powers, in which it should be pointed out that this country really meant business with regard to the Protocol and was not attempting to kill it by procrastination. At the same time, it could be explained that the question was one of vital importance, which required the most careful consideration, and that it was unlikely that we should be in a position to make a definite pronouncement on the subject by next March. He called attention to two other points : firstly, he was of the opinion that the activities of the Committee should not only be directed to detailed criticism of the Protocol in its present form, but that it should be instructed to prepare a constructive policy; secondly, he expressed the opinion that great difficulties would arise if the conclusion of a pact with France and Belgium was decided upon as an alternative to adhesion to the Protocol, because of the strength of Germany, which, in his opinion, was likely to increase, and in consequence of which permanent peace could never be assured for Europe.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN explained that, if it were decided to enter into a pact with France and Belgium to guarantee their security, it might be possible at a later date to induce Germany to enter into a similar pact, but that the French, would never agree to the inclusion of such an arrangement in the original document.SIR EYRE CROWE pointed out that the two main political objections to the Protocol appeared to be with regard to the question of compulsory arbitration and the application of sanctions. Was it the intention to deal with the objections under these heads and see how far it was possible by redrafting to circumvent them 1LORD CECIL suggested that it was desirable to redraft the articles referring to the specific points mentioned by Sir Eyre Crowe and then to see how far such a redraft would meet the criticisms of the various Departments.Conclusions. THE COMMITTEE agreed :-1. That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should forward for the personal information of the Prime Ministers of the Dominions, the minutes of the 190th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on the 4th December, 1924, and of the 192nd Meeting held on the 16th December, 1924,
2. That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should notify the Prime Ministers of the Dominions by telegram that the above Minutes and the various departmental comments on the Protocol are being sent for their information, and should ask them to be so good as to send their preliminary observations, whether by despatch or by telegram, if possible, before the end of January 1925.3. That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should telegraph to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions to the effect that the issues raised by the Geneva Protocol on Arbitration, Security and Limitation of Armaments, are so important that His Majesty&apos;s Government have come to the conclusion that personal contact with the Prime Ministers of the Dominions is essential if it can be arranged; that they propose that a Conference on the subject should be held; and that, in view of the report made to them by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs after his visit to Rome as British Representative on the Council of the League of Nations, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that the Imperial Conference ought to meet at the earliest possible date, which they take to be the beginning of March, in order that an answer may be given in regard to the Protocol during the month of March.4. That the Secretary of State for India should, at his discretion, send corresponding communications, mutatis mutandis, to the Government of India.5. That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should take steps to ascertain the general attitude of the American Secretary of State towards the Protocol.6. That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should consider the desirability of warning foreign nations that His Majesty&apos;s Government, while expediting to the utmost its examination of the Protocol in concert with the Dominions and India, may find it impossible to give their final answer on a question involving such momentous issues, at the meeting of the Council of the League arranged for March 1925.7. That a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, composed as follows : Sir Maurice Hankey (in the Chair), Sir Eyre Crowe,A Representative of the Colonial Office, A Representative of the India Office,Joint Secretaries from the Foreign Office and the Committee of Imperial Defence,together with Representatives of the Treasury, Board of Trade, and the three Service Departments, when questions affecting their Departments are under consideration&quot;\-^should meet forthwith to consider and to report if possible by Saturday, tBfe^Oth January, 1925(1.)

REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS.-PACIFIC  SETTLEMENT OF INTER-NATIONAL DISPUTES. FRENCH AND BELGIAN SECURITY.   &apos;(Previous Reference : C.I.B. Minutes of 193rd Meeting, Minute 1.) (From StenographihNotes.)LORD CURZON : Perhaps I may preface our proceedings by stating in a sentence or two the position in which we are met this morning.The Committee will remember that some weeks ago we placed in the hands of a Sub-Committee, of which the Chairman was our Secretary, Sir Maurice Hankey, the task of examining in detail the terms of the Protocol of Geneva, and ascertaining in what way the criticisms that had been passed upon it, mainly by the Departments here, could be met, either by modification of the Protocol itself or, by other sugges-tions to take its place, and indeed whether it would be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take the line of proceeding with the Protocol in its present condition at all. That Committee met, held several sittings and produced a Report, which we have before us, and for which I am sure the Committee will allow me to thank and congratulate Sir Maurice Hankey and his Committee. I have never read an abler document, or one hi which there was &quot;a more keen and profound appreciation of all the issues involved. The substance of the Report of that Committee is this. The Protocol in its original form is eviscerated by them. They propose the complete dropping of certain of the more important clauses to which grave objection has already been taken at this table. As regards the remainder, and even as regards some of the former, they make alternative suggestions which they think it might be wise to propose in the form of a modification of the Covenant of the League of Nations. They draw attention to the fact that it would be an extremely undesirable thing to have, so to speak, two bodies of law regulating the international relations of the world a Covenant and a Protocol and that if modifications are to be made in the law of nations in this respect they ought to be made by alterations in the Covenant, rather than by setting up a rival code at its side.Finally, they propose that the modifications suggested by them, if accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, should be couched in the shape of a Protocol, so that the world will not think that we are rejecting the Geneva Protocol altogether, but that, at any rate in form, we are preserving some of its essential features. That, in substance, is the proposal of the. Committee. At the end of their Report they make, a further suggestion as to the kind of interim reply which His Majesty&apos;s Government might think fit to send to the League of Nations.We have, further, had presented to us since our last Meeting the opinions of some, at any rate, of our principal Dominions. We have not had the full and reasoned reply of Australia, but New Zealand has sent a long paper, South Africa, a long and very carefully argued and, as it seems to me, a most important opinion. The full reply of Canada has still to come in. Then in the last week we have had a draft despatch, prepared by Lord Balfour and circulated to us, which is an endeavour on his part to put into the form of a despatch the argument with which he favoured us three or four weeks ago. It will be observed that that draft states in a manner of which he alone is capable the principal objections advanced by himself and by others, and indeed by the Committee, to the main provisions of the Protocol. In substance-his draft is a rejection of the Protocol, formulating the objections to it in the most general terms in a manner incapable, as it seems to me, of exciting prejudice, and carrying with it the weight both of philosophic reasoning and of logical expression. That despatch will come under discussion this morning. At the end of the despatch Lord Balfour makes certain suggestions, not necessarily essential to his argument, as to his own view of the manner in which this problem might be treated, assuming that the Protocol is not further proceeded with. 1That is the position to-day, and no doubt we shall hear later from Lord Balfoui anything he may have to say to us about his own despatch, but it occurred to me that the fairest way to proceed would be to ask the Foreign Secretary to give us any views that he may like to offer at this stage. .Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I feel that Lord Balfour has done us a great service by giving us something concrete to work upon, which helps to concentrate our thoughts.My inclination would be to proceed upon the lines both of Lord Balfour&apos;s despatch and of the Report of Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s Committee, by which I mean
that we should first send a letter to the League of Nations and a circular despatch to the Powers saying that for the reasons given by Lord Balfour I would like to look through the actual wording, and even perhaps particular arguments, very carefully before we actually decide on its terms we were unable to proceed with the Protocol, but that we should conclude merely at this stage, if we take that step quite early, by a statement that we were considering other proposals and hoped to be able to make constructive suggestions to the League for consideration at a later time.LORD CURZON : May I interpolate one remark at this stage % You, of course, will remember that if it is proposed to proceed on those lines and to issue something in the nature of Lord Balfour&apos;s despatch, it would be necessary to send it to the Dominions in advance.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Yes. I think really the matter has become one of such urgency that, knowing what we do, we may say there is a certain consensus of opinion in the Empire that the Protocol will not do as it stands, and that we should have to telegraph this out to them and ask their concurrence, and, if they agree, send the despatch which we propose.Then the second and much more difficult stage is the constructive proposal which we should substitute for it. I am myself broadly, but strongly, in favour of the line adopted by Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s Committee, and I feel every day in the discharge of my work at the Foreign Office the urgent necessity of having at the earliest possible moment a declaration of the policy of the British Government in respect of all these questions of security. I did indeed begin the preparation of a paper for the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet to explain why I thought it so urgent, and what the position was; but I found that the other calls upon my time made it quite impossible for me to complete it. It is the kind of paper I cannot dictate off-hand without a good deal of work, and it needs a concentration of thought when you sit down to consider it, which is incompatible with your door opening every v quarter of an hour for somebody to be shown in. But it is getting day by day more difficult for me to conduct any foreign policy or to handle the immediate daily problems of my office without being able to say anything to the Ambassadors who come to see me, or to give any instructions to our representatives abroad, as to the probable line of policy of the British Government in relation to these questions of security. For instance, this morning I received a telegram, which has not yet been circulated or seen by the members of the Committee a telegram which came by bag from Lord Crewe last night giving an account of a conversation with M. Herriot. Although it is rather lengthy, I think I shall not be wasting time if I read it.&quot; I had some conversation this morning with the President of the Council on the subject of M. de Fleuriau&apos;s letter to Sir Eyre Crowe of 10th February. On the point made in that letter that he considered the evacuation of the Cologne zone to be a question that must be decided between the military auhorities and not one suited to consideration by a conference of international Ministers, M. Herriot said that he is absolutely determined to respect the provisions of the treaty, so that evacuation must take place when the terms of Article 429 are complied with. He showed some signs of reverting to his contention that the last paragraph of that Article has a bearing on the present situation.&quot; The President of the Council went on to say that the one thought in his mind is that of the security of France. The word obsede was the only one he could use of his own feelings regarding it.&quot;I might say it seems to me that all Europe is obsede by the question of security in one form or another, and when I say &quot; by the question of security;&quot; it is not the negative absence of security, it is the positive presence of insecurity that creates this troublesome and difficult situation.&quot; He fully recognised your determination that the security of France must not be neglected during the present discussion, and he was even encouraged by the attitude nOw taken by the German Government.&quot; He then proceeded to tell me, in absolute confidence, of the communication described in Lord D&apos;Abernon&apos;s secret telegram No. 60, adding that he had not * yet disclosed it to anybody, even the Political Director.&quot;The Committee know that some time ago Lord d&apos;abernon received under the strictest seal of confidence from Dr. Stresemann suggestions for a German-Franco-Anglo pact of guarantee with the obligation imposed that as it was known only to Luther and Stresemann I should, say nothing about it to the French.   I refused [12692] b 2
to receive any communication from the Germans on those terms, and said that it was impossible for me to admit that we were under obligations of secrecy towards our Allies, as that would destroy all confidence between us and our Allies, and would not help the Germans in the long run because it would destroy all my influence with the Allies. I added that already, owing to the publication in a German newspaper which followed that extreme secrecy within forty-eight hours, M. de Fleurieau had been pressing Sir Eyre Crowe to know what had been taking place. Would you believe it, the same German Government which does that with me now hands the same document to M. Herriot with an obligation on him not to tell me that they have done so. Then you ask me how is anyone to help the Germans and expect me to answer. That is a document which was supposed not to be disclosed to the French, and of the receipt of which by the French I am not to&apos; be informed now.LORD CURZON : And of which they immediately informed you.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : M. Herriot did as I did.&apos;&apos; He (M. Herriot) spoke in appreciative terms of the German Chancellor, whom he believes to be well-intentioned and honourable, and he added that he did not believe that there is any serious obstacle to the conclusion of a pact to ensure security in which Germany would be included. He recognised completely that, if France is guaranteed against German aggression, Germany has an equal right to be similarly guaranteed against any attack by France. He said this as a pacifist by conviction, and with no sort of arriere-pensee. . He also recognised that you have to keep in view British public opinion which may be liable to misunderstand the intentions of the French Government, but he has also to consider the public opinion of France with reference to these two questions of the evacuation of the first zone and that of security. He knew that you wish to keep these two matters entirely distinct, and though there might be no rapport juridique between them, yet he maintained that there is a rapport de causalite.&quot; I observed that I took this to mean that, assuming that according to his view the Allied military authorities concerted with those of Germany that the infractions of the treaty which prevented immediate evacuation could be rectified within a certain time, three, four or five months, or whatever it might be, French public opinion would not permit part of the eastern frontier to be left defenceless, and yet he had announced his intention of faithfully observing the obligations of the treaty. From his point of view, therefore, it seems imperative that he should secure the moral assurance which he hoped to obtain for France before the date contemplated for the complete evacuation of the zone. M. Herriot implied that this is his position, and he thought that by Easter it would be possible to hold the proposed conference of Ministers which would take in hand the wider questions. He also stands to his pledge to clear out of the Ruhr in August. He repeated that though he would have much liked a preliminary conversation with yourself, yet he realised that the susceptibilities of both Italy and Belgium might be wounded if it was thought that conversations were going on behind their backs.&apos;&apos; My general impression is that the President of the Council is genuinely desirous of fulfilling the terms of the treaty, and that his repeated assertions of his intense anxiety about security equally represent the truth. He feels that, unless he can allay popular feeling on the latter subject, he may be swept away and replaced by an administration of more Nationalist temper. This is why he is afraid to treat the Cologne question as isolated, while determined not to lay himself open to the reproach of playing tricks with the Treaty of Versailles. I hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government may find, if possible, to help him over this difficult piece of ground without departing from the line indicated in your recent telegram and despatches.&quot;My line has been to say in the firmest language that I could, which I repeated only yesterday to the Belgian Ambassador, that the question of the evacuation of the Cologne area was a question of the Treaty only and could not be linked with or made conditional on the question of security. He mentioned Inter-Allied Debts. I said even less, or equally little, was the question of security connected with the question of Inter-Allied Debts, and that any attempt to put the British Government under duress in relation to the evacuation of the Cologne area through the question of security or debts could only lead to the impossibility of continuing the very cordial and intimate co-operation which existed between us.   That is a perfectly
clear and proper line and the only line for the British Government to take, but unless we can lay this obsession of insecurity of which M. Herriot spoke, I do not see how we can avoid having a breach which may well be a fatal breach between the policy of France and Belgium and the policy of England.   We may say we are coming out of Cologne and. they may go into it.   Very likely I should find them perfectly intransigeant about defaults.    In respect of the defaults what I have been trying to secure was that first of all our military advisers should examine the report when we get it and advise each of the Governments that they should sieve out the small stuff and give us only the big and important questions to deal with. That then the Ministers should meet to consider these decisions and to determine what we should require of the Germans.   Then we should bring the Germans Id a meeting with us, and across the table hand them these requirements, inviting them to go out of the room to consider them, and asking them to come back and toll us how soon they can fulfil these undertakings, because we would prepare for evacuation for the date they name.   I believe in that way, if you could handle the matter in that way, you could.get a satisfactory solution of the immediate question and a real step forward towards the pacification of Europe and a much better attitude on the part of France, which is the first condition of getting to the new Europe. As I look out of the Foreign Office window on to Europe I say to myself all the time I have to work to achieve, if I can, this result: I have to keep my eyes fixed on a date like 1960 or 1970, when Germany will be in a position through one cause or another to attack again if she wants to, and by that time there must have grown up in Germany a new generation who, whatever their feelings of resentment about the Treaty of Versailles, of pain at the situation which that Treaty brought upon Germany, will yet say, after all, things must have an end; at this moment we have too much to lose and the risks of trying fortune again are too great for us to undertake a quarrel.    But if you are to have a chance of getting that kind of generation in Germany in 1960 or 1970, you must begin the work of pacification to-morrow; and I am afraid you cannot get the French to do the things&apos;that are necessary to allow that new feeling to grow up in Germany so long as the French are.so frightened.   Therefore, as a first stage in the moral pacification of Europe, I press that we should deal with this question of security at the earliest possible moment and make up our minds what we can do.   I think it should be on the lines indicated in the Hankey Committee&apos;s Report.   I am sorry to have taken so long. I am no less obsessed with this question than M. Herriot, and I see the time coming when, unless we can deal quickly with this question, we may be confronted with a very serious situation.LORD CURZON : Would you add a little on one point ? You talked a great deal about the French feeling of insecurity. ? Is there any ground for that feeling existing in an aggravated form now ? I think you quoted, either from that telegram or from some source, words speaking of the defenceless condition of the Eastern frontier of France. But there is no defenceless condition there. France is the most powerful military country in Europe. Germany is disarmed. It may be that a danger will grow up in the future, and, no doubt, the right way to avoid it is, as you say, to induce a pacific feeling in Germany herself so that she may abandon ideas of revenge. But, for the moment, surely, there is no danger at all, and when we hear about the French Government and the French nation being obsessed with their own helplessness and insecurity, is not that done to a large extent to put pressure on us?   Does it represent an existing fact?Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I think undoubtedly it does-no, I am answering two questions and I must separate them. As to the genuineness of the feeling I have not the least doubt. It preoccupies the Belgians as it preoccupies the French. The fear of a struggle arising in the West, the instability of the position in the West preoccupies the small Powers in the East who would feel that there was much less likelihood of trouble breaking out in the East if the position in. the West were stable instead of being, as at present, in their opinion, it is, very unstable. Therefore, astothegenuinenessof the feeling I have no doubt. If you ask me whether the facts are such as to justify fear as to the immediate future, in my opinion they are not; they are not. I am as unable to see why the French should be frightened at this moment as I am to measure the forces which direct German diplomacy. But the French are preoccupied. Even at the moment I have, had from the War Office suggestions -that they should enter into communication with the French General Staff as to the reinforcements which could be sent to France and the measures which .
should be taken in order to guard against a German attack in the event of the Cologne area being evacuated. ^ We have not thought it desirable that any negotiations of that kind should go on at the present moment. I am afraid I have not spoken to the Secretary of State for War about it, but there is a minute in my papers to say I must see the Secretary of State for War when he returns and find out what was exactly in the minds of the War Office and the General Staff on this subject. But at any rate it arose, I imagine, on proposals from Marshal Foch to ^consider how you would deal with an irruption of the Germans through Cologne. It sterns to me an absurdity.\ SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS : It was not our proposal. It came from Marshal Foch through us and we had to answer it.&apos;Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Exactly. You see the French are concerned about]it. Even so sane a man as.Marshal Foch appears to be concerned about it. I do not see the immediate dangers, but I do see several reasons why the French should be frightened for the future, and while they remain so frightened they go on cultivating, as &apos;it were, reproducing that very feeling of bitterness in Germany which is the cause of their fear.   It is moving in an unending vicious circle.LORD CURZON : We have rather got on to the question of security. It arose out of the Protocol, but 1 suppose we ought to continue the discussion in the Committee hOw on the lines of Lord Balfour&apos;s Despatch.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I think merely to refuse the Protocol and not to say that, in some form or another, you are trying to deal with these problems would be disastrous.LORD CURZON : 1 think we are agreed on that. Would you like to say some-thing at this stage, Lord Balfour 1LORD BALFOUR: The only observation I have to make to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s most luminous statement is that I am not sure that I am a fair judge of this, because I am so cross with the French. I think their obsession is so intolerably foolish that I do not feel I am a fair judge of that. They are so dreadfully afraid of being swallowed up by the tiger, but yet they spend their time poking it.LORD CURZON : And the tiger is not a tiger for the moment.LORD BALFOUR: The worst of it is that, unfortunately, the things that they want us to do I am convinced would be most unpopular in this country, and we shall get into trouble because we are doing something which we do not approve of or see the immediate necessity for to please people who cannot manage their own affairs and which we should never do if they were not rather insane, if we were not dealing with people who are psychologically upset. It is a most embarrassing situation. I quite see the difficulties of the Foreign Secretary. I have thought we might do something if we entered into a pledge; if we say we do not believe there is any danger; you think there is a danger. Now we do not agree, but we are quite agreed the danger may come and as soon as the danger does come we are prepared to enter into a full and frank discussion as to how it is to be met. They may say you may be in a different mood then; that is the sort of reply they make, but you must remember the country will be in a different mood then. What is the use of making pledges to fight. You cannot drive people against their will into a war which they feel at the time may destroy themselves and which they feel is not a war they should be undertaking. A pledge given now that we are going to war in twenty years time, that is a ludicrous pledge because the country may feel then that France is wrong and Germany will not go to war again. If we give a pledge it should be that if the danger shows itself we are ready to enter into arrangement with France and ready to enter into a pledge now that we would always be ready to consider a question like this and to consider it in the fullest and frankest way. We are not going to tolerate German&apos; destruction of the West of Europe, German domination of Western Europe. We are as resolved as we ever were against that policy, but this kind of anticipated military and naval arrangements years before they are required only irritate the world, only make it restless, and I think we should, with this giving of a pledge that we are always ready to consider it, we should wait until the danger does really show itself.LORD BIRKENHEAD : I am in entire agreement with Lord Balfour&apos;s general view. I have read his Memorandum with more interest than I have read any public docu-ment for a very long time, but I am bound to say that the kind of assurance which he
should be taken in order to guard against a German attack in the event of the Cologne area being evacuated. (j.

A pledge given now that we are going to war in twenty years time, that is a ludicrous pledge because the country may feel then that France is wrong and Germany will not go to war again. If we give a pledge it should be that if the danger shows itself we are ready to enter into arrangement with France and ready to enter into a pledge now that we would always be ready to consider a question like this and to consider it in the fullest and frankest way. We are not going to tolerate German destruction of the West of Europe, German domination of Western Europe. We are as resolved as we ever were against that policy, but this kind of anticipated military and naval arrangements years before they are required only irritate the world, only make it restless, and I think we should, with this giving of a pledge that we are always ready to consider it, we should wait until the danger does really show itself.LORD BIRKENHEAD : I am in entire agreement with Lord Balfour&apos;s general view. I have read his Memorandum with more interest than I have read any public docu-ment for a very long time, but I am bound to say that the kind of assurance which he
recommends (I do not know that it is possible to give any other, the Foreign Secretary will tell me if I am wrong), but I do not think the French would attach the slightest importance to it. I am with him in his estimate of the French attitude, but what does it come to ? It comes to this. To say to the French that if and when a crisis arises, when the dormant tiger becomes alive, we shall most carefully consider and sympathetically consider whether or not we are in a position, having regard to public opinion and other considerations to support you. That is all it. comes to really. It may be that is all we can do, but I do not suppose that the anxieties of the Foreign Secretary in dealing with the French would be very much alleviated by our authori-sation to give them such an assurance. I do not know whether that is so or not. I should like to make another suggestion. I am so ignorant of the tendency of Europe, that I make it with great hesitation. Would it be impossible, having regard to&quot; the conversations which the Foreign Secretary has described, which he held with the Germans and which the Germans have held, with the French, would it be impossible that there should be a fair guarantee of the independence and the inviolability of Belgium to which the Germans, the French and ourselves should be a party. I think it would create a mood.of good feeling in the proceedings to ask Germany once again to guarantee the independence of Belgium and I think she would agree. If she did agree, I think it is much, more unlikely she would violate the agreement than it was in 1914. I do not know whether the Foreign Secretary thinks it is worth considering. I believe Germany would accept that and I think it is extremely unlikely she would violate it. You could make a certain number of provisions with regard to strategic railways which would give material guarantees.Mr. AMERY : May I say something rather in endorsement of the suggestion made by the Secretary of State for India ?Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Before you do that, may I just be sure what his proposal is. Is it confined to the Belgian frontier, or would he seek to make a guarantee not merely for the Belgian frontier, but for the French as well.LORD BIRKENHEAD : I said Belgian, Foreign Secretary, for this reason. I understood, though I have not the slightest knowledge of strategy, that any attack upon . France in that direction depended really upon the violation of Belgian territory. I do not in the least mind if you like to make it wider and if you can get the Germans to assent, as I suppose you can, to a wider guarantee. It is not incompatible with the principle involved in my suggestion.LORD CURZON : Before we pursue that branch of the subject, which is very important I should like to say something about it myself we might ask Lord Cecil to give his opinion upon the whole subject. You will remember that this meeting&apos; was. postponed from Tuesday last in order to enable him to be here. I think it is only right that he should give us his views at an early stage.LORD CECIL: I am very grateful to the Lord President. Of course, my I position is a difficult one because I saw these papers for the first time yesterday morning, because they were treated, I think quite rightly, as of such a secret character that it was not thought right to send them to me at Geneva. Therefore, I have only had the opportunity, amidst other work, of reading them once or twice; indeed, I have not read all of them once. I confess that I find myself in a very difficult position. I agree most heartily with the Foreign Secretary, that it is absolutely essential for the peace of Europe that you should relieve the French- mind, not, I think, of fear for the immediate future; I do not think that is really what is in their minds; it is fear for what might happen to their children, and that, believe me, is not confined to a few people in the Quai d&apos;Orsay or in the lobbies of the Chamber of Deputies. It is spread over the whole of France. Every man and woman in France has that terror in their mind. It is the dominant feeling that they have, I am convinced, in all their outlook on public affairs. To say that they are foolish, as Lord Balfour has said, is very greatly to understate the case; but it is the folly of panic, I believe^with many of them, more than anything else. 1 also think, personally, that there are other countries which you will have to consider if you are to take a wide view of European politics, whose spheres are not so prominently brought before us, but are, none the less, very vital to the peace of Europe, particularly some of the Central European States. They cannot be ignored. I quite recognise the immense difficulty of our doing anything to help, but. to say that they can be ignored in the pacification of Europe is really to shut your eyes, as it seems to me, to the essential facts of the European situation.
Then I come to the Report of the Hankey Committee. I need not say I share the admiration for its skill and for its industry. I begin by a criticism of detail. I am not quite sure that I understand why the Hankey Committee and the Lord President regarded it as so axiomatic that whatever we do must be done by way of amendment of the Covenant and not by way of a separate engagement. I should have thought myself that there were very considerable advantages in the other procedure. I do not feel very much drawn to the view that we have got to put all our obligations into one document. We do not, in fact. We have got, of course, a very large number of obligations of a more or less extensive character, which are apart from the Covenant, and I see great objection personally to an extensive amendment of the Covenant at so early a stage in the career of the League of Nations. I think you will let yourselves in, even by proposing it, for very con-siderable difficulty, and it is one of my chief objections to the Geneva Protocol that it did proceed, at any rate in form, in that way. I think the more you go into it the more difficulties you will find. Other countries will gradually say : &quot; We joined the League on one set of ideas, now you want to change it.&quot; I doubt very much whether you will get the changes through. If you do, you will be creating new obstacles for those who we hope may some day join the League, and it seems to me there is a very great deal to be said for keeping whatever you do separate altogether from the Covenant, making it an entirely separate obligation, and one into which members of the League may or may not enter, and which will be necessarily, as I think, very largely attached to the League, as many other Treaty obligations now are, in the sense that the Council of the League would have to discharge functions in connection with it, but it would not be part of the Covenant of the League.LORD CURZON : Do you really mean that the Protocol would be a document to which certain great Powers might adhere, but from which others might abstain, and therefore that it would be only partial in its application ?LORD CECIL : Evidently you could not have a document of that kind which would become effective unless a very considerable number of Powers adhered to it; otherwise, it would not be safe for any of them to come into it and, therefore, this Clause, which brought it into force, would have to be such as to take care that a very large number of Powers joined it before it came into force.Mb. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : May I follow that up a little? What would, be the position under those circumstances if a quarrel broke out when, in the first place, you had the United States a party neither to the Protocol nor the Covenant; Russia we assume still a party neither to the Protocol nor to the Covenant; Germany, Italy, and a certain number of other Powers parties to the Covenant, but not to the Protocol; France, Belgium and ourselves parties to the Protocol as Well as to the Covenant ? What would be the position ? What would be the public law of Europe in those circumstances, and under which document would you try to settle any dispute?LORD CECIL: It would depend, of course, on who were the parties to the dispute which document would apply. I do not think there would really be more difficulty in doing that than in any other partial alliance. There are a number of agreements now the Little Entente and a number of other agreements which provide for special ways of settling special disputes. I do not think there will be any difficulty in extending that principle to the larger case.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : It would be a new Regional Pact?LORD CECIL: Yes, that would be the nature of it.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : But the region to which it applied would be scattered over the world in islands ?LORD CECIL : Obviously, if you could not get a more or less homogeneous Europe joining in the Pact, it could not come into force. I quite agree with that. You could not have a Pact of this kind, or any Pact of any kind which dealt with international disputes, unless it extended to a considerable body of people. Take the suggestion which has been made to-day, the suggestion of a Regional Agreement, as I will call it. for the moment, between Germany, France, Belgium and England;. you would have the same theoretical difficulty about disputes arising in which there would be those Powers which would be parties to the one set of obligations, a larger section which would be parties to the League obligations, and a certain section which
would be parties to neither. You have got to face that difficulty, I think, to some extent I do not say to the full extent, but to some extent; in any case, if you are going to proceed by Regional Agreement-at least, so it seems to me.SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER : May I put this point ? It is rather from the practical side, on sanctions. If you had a separate document, a party to that document would be obliged to enforce the weight of the economic sanctions against a country which had not accepted the obligation to pay compensation, or to be a party to the Protocol.LORD CECIL: It just depends on how extensive your document is; but the point is you could not have a document of this kind unless you got practically the whole of the Great Powers in Europe to assent to it. I quite agree to that. I should like that point to be further looked into myself. I think there is a good deal to be said on both sides, but that.is not the main part of what I desire to say. I have read with great care the proposals made by the Hankey Committee, and they come to very little in practice. If I may be allowed just to run through them in detail. There are only six operative articles. Article 2 suggests the possibility of a country agreeing to a demilitarised zone. It does not do more than suggest that countries may do so if they like. I do not want to minimise that. I think it is one of the very few articles which does make a definite proposal, but it does not come to very much, because, of course, they can do that without this Protocol if they like to agree to a demilitarised zone. All that it says is that, if the State in which the demilitarised zone is situated agrees to that, then the League may, if they like, appoint inspectors of that demilitarised zone. It does not come to a great deal. I think it does come to something. Article 3, I am afraid, I think comes to nothing at all. It says that anybody who violates Article 15 of the Covenant is to be called an aggressor. It leaves it to the Council as to whether aggression has taken place. That is, as I understand it, an existing provision of the Covenant. Then, if agree-ment cannot be arrived at, it is actively to persuade the parties to agree to an Armistice. I should have thought it ought to do that in any case, whether they are going to arrive at a conclusion or not. It would be the obvious thing that the Council should try and induce the parties not to go on fighting. In the Corfu case, the first thing we did was to pass a resolution asking the parties not to take any further military action.SIR MAURICE HANKEY : It is in the Protocol, of course. We were trying to save what we could.LORD CECIL : It was rather more than that. If I remember rightly, the Protocol directed the Council to impose an Armistice, which is rather a different proposition. Then Comes the final thing, which says, violation of the rules laid down for a demilitarised zone may be considered by the Council to be equivalent to a resort to- war. I should have thought that also went without saying. It is evident that violation of the rules for a demilitarised zone might amount to a resort to war, and it is equally evident it might not. All the provision says is that it might. Then we come to the redraft of Article 16. I am coming back to that in a minute, but the purpose of that is to diminish the importance and vigour of Article 16, so that that does not come to very much, at any rate from the point of view of those who framed the Protocol. It is a step backwards, from their point of view. I do hot say that the next article comes to nothing at all. When the Council has notified that somebody is an aggressor, that is to go on until the aggression is terminated, which again I should have thought almost went without saying. As for the next proposition, it is merely restating in a rather weakened form the obligation existing under Article 16. Of course, I ought to have pointed out that none of this applies to any case except that contemplated by Article 15. It does not apply to the case which is left out of Article 15, in fact, the case occurring after the determination of the dispute. It is only applied to cases under Article 15, as I understand it. Then comes a provision which I think is already covered by a resolution passed in the Second Assembly, mamely, that it is to be open to the Council to- make recommendations as to how Article 16 should be enforced, if it is to be enforced. Then comes Article 6, which I daresay is a valuable piece of machinery. It deals with two things, how proceedings under Article 16 are to be brought to an end, and also, what is to happen to contracts, which I agree would have to be dealt with sooner or later. It is also covered in principle by the resolution of the Second Assembly, which directs that the matter should be considered by the Council. I do not deny that that may be of certain value.   It has no value so far as security is-concerned.[12692] c
It is just a useful piece of machinery. Then we come to Article 7, which is, of course, by far the most important article. It is rather a curiously worded Article. It says : t: In view of the contingent Military, Naval and Air staffs provided for by Article 16 of the Covenant, members of the League may intimate to the Council specific contingencies in which they will be prepared to make . . . .&quot;LORD CURZON: Will you allow me to put a point to you? You are now favouring us with your view, point by point, upon certain draft proposals that have been submitted to us by the Sub-Committee, and, no doubt, if they are made the basis of discussion, we shall have to go through them one by one and listen to the kind of criticisms you are making, but surely we have not reached that stage yet? I did not contemplate this morning that we should consider the actual terms of an amended Protocol. All that we are here to consider is the best method of proceeding at the present time, which raises the big questions of what sort of answer we ought to recommend to our Dominions; what sort of answer we ought to return to the League of Nations; whether we should proceed upon the lines of adopting, in some degree, Lord Balfour&apos;s reply, or whether we should act upon the general lines of this Report, postponing to a later date actual discussion of the specific proposals. We shall hear all this later on.  Isn&apos;t it a little premature now ?LORD CECIL : I am anxious not to do anything the Committee does not want me to do. I will be silent at once if I am told to be silent. I do not see how the Committee can really form a judgment as to whether this is a good alternative proposal unless they realise what it amounts to. The Foreign Secretary suggested that what we should do would be to send a circular despatch on the lines of Lord Balfour&apos;s draft, plus a statement of policy on the lines of this Protocol.LORD CURZON : Oh no, he did not suggest that we should send that at the present moment. On the contrary, I understood his suggestion to be an interim reply of the nature you have described, and that then we should proceed to a discussion of the alternatives, which may be a matter, not only of days, but of weeks. &quot;Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : At the same time I pressed a plea for urgency. To despatch a definite statement that we are endeavouring to provide a constructive alternative with as little delay as possible.LORD CULtZON : Doesn&apos;t that mean that a discussion of the constructive alternative could not take place with advantage at the present moment ?LORD BIRKENHEAD : Do not let us promise a constructive alternative without anything in our minds.LORD CURZON : We shall spend a long time in working it out.LORD CECIL : I am in great difficulty because I must say, quite frankly  I do not want to say anything wild at all I think the policy suggested is a fatal policy, a really fatal policy.Mr. CHURCHILL : Which policy?LORD CECIL : The policy suggested by the Sub-Committee is a really fatal policy. I cannot tell you how dangerous it appears to me, and therefore I am terrified lest we should proceed on the assumption which I thought was running through the Committee that something of that kind was the right policy.Mr. CHURCHILL : Do you want more or less ?LORD CECIL: More, I think. Not necessarily more of the Protocol, but a more constructive policy. Broadly, I am very firmly opposed to the way this would appear to the Assembly of the League of Nations, or, indeed, to any other body. What they would say is : &quot;We ask you for three things disarmament, security, arbitration and prohibition of war. You give us no disarmament&quot;  because practically that is the effect of this Report.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Oh, no.LORD CECIL: They would say: &quot;Yes, we might have a Conference on Disarmament because it would not quite do for the British Government to turn down the proposal, but we know that nothing will come of it on such a proposal
as this. The French would not agree to any disarmament on such a document as this.&quot;   I do not think I am overstating the argument.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN: That is not the Committee&apos;s view, surely.LORD CECIL : I think it is.SIR SAMUEL HOARE : I think it is, really.LORD CECIL: At any rate, it is mine, and I think it is the view of the Committee.SIR MAURICE HANKEY : I do not think it is the Committee&apos;s view at all.LORD CURZON: As Chairman of the Committee, you are perfectly at liberty to speak if you desire to do so.SIR MAURICE HANKEY : I do not think myself that we have suggested for a moment that this draft Protocol, standing by itself, would form the basis of a Conference on Disarmament. But you have to take the Report as a whole. We have made other proposals that go with this. This is the best we can do to save some part of the Protocol.   We have to take with it the security suggestion.LORD CECIL : This is the paragraph I had in mind : &quot;Paragraph 106 : Another reason in favour of not throwing the Protocol overboard altogether is that by so doing we should appear as the party directly responsible for frustrating the calling of the contemplated Disarmament Conference on Reduction of Armaments, which has been made dependent on the adoption of the Protocol by a sufficient number of Powers. Without wishing to express much confidence in the success of any such conference, we presume His Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer not to assume unnecessarily the odium of preventing it ab initio. They may avoid this by letting at least part of the framework of the Protocol survive.&quot;Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Surely, neither Lord Cecil nor any of us can be under the illusion that by signing the Protocol we should seriously advance the prospect of European disarmament not one bit. I am as anxious as anyone to advance the disarmament of Europe, but the Protocol will not do it. It may produce a Conference, but the Conference, with the Protocol and nothing else before it, would produce no disarmament.LORD CECIL : The proposal of the Protocol, whether a good or a bad proposal, was that it should not come into force unless some disarmament scheme resulted from the Disarmament Conference; and the Disarmament Conference was to be called on the basis of whether, if the obligations contained in the Protocol were undertaken, it was possible to arrive at any disarmament. It is not that by itself the Protocol would produce disarmament, but those who desire security given them by a Protocol could not get it unless they were prepared to enter into some agreed scheme of Disarmament. I do not feel that that is so hopeless a proposition as the other. I think the mere acceptance of a Protocol without that would not probably produce disarmament. I agree. If you stated : &quot; You will have security if you will enter into an agreement to limit or reduce your armament, but you cannot have security unless you do that,&quot; I think there is then a possibility of a successful issue.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Perhaps I had better say nothing, because I should be doing what I said I should not do.LORD. CECIL: I do not want to make a speech; that is the last thing I want to do.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : This is my difficulty about it: You sign the Protocol. You automatically proceed at an interval of six months to your Military Conference. unless you have fortified the Protocol with other guarantees for security there would be no disarmament and consequently there would be no Protocol. \\LORD CECIL : That may be so, but I am not quite sure myself.   At any rate, it seems to me you really do institute a practical test as to the genuineness of those who desire security.   If they say :   &quot;We are not going into this Disarmament Conference unless we get something more than a Protocol,&quot; I agree; but, if they [12692] ^ c 2
say : &quot; We are prepared to go into a Disarmament Conference on the basis of the Protocol,&quot; then you are able to say at the end: &quot;Well, if you will not agree to disarmament, we cannot give you the Protocol.&quot;Mil. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN: You, in effect, say the Protocol gives insufficient security. They have already said it. The Belgians do not pretend that they will be satisfied with the Protocol: the French do not pretend that they will be satisfied with the Protocol; and I myself hold very strongly that engagements so wide as those contained in the Protocol are engagements which we surely know, in given conditions such as those foreshadowed by Lord Balfour, the. signatories will not honour, and that therefore the Protocol does, in fact, give no security. It tries to do too much.LORD CECIL : I think there is a great deal of force in that. I do not want to be forced into the position of a defender of the Protocol. There are a great many of the provisions ofj the Protocol I should never think of defending and never have defended, but something in the nature of a general agreement of that kind, I believe, would have to be filled out in detail by subsidiary agreements. I have always believed that, and that you would not get the full measure of disarmament without those subsidiary agreements. I think it is of great importance that they should be kept within a general line and should not be outside the general line if it were possible.I really do not quite know what I ought to do after the intimation of our Chairman, because I do not want I need not say to go too much into detail, as long as I am sure that I am not going to be asked to assent to the proposals of the Hankey Committee as a satisfactory solution to this question as the result of this discussion. Particularly, I do very earnestly beg you to consider what would be the result of putting any such proposal as this before any body of nations and saying : &apos;&apos; What we really propose is this; we are going to give you something which will not amount to any increase of your security; we do not really in our hearts pretend that it will, but we hope that you may be induced by that form to accept a considerable reduction of your protection under Article 16.&quot; I cannot believe that that is a policy which is a good one. We are not dealing with children; we are dealing with some of the acutest minds in Europe. They would see instantly what you meant cutting down Article 16 and giving nothing in exchange except the pact at the end, with which I will deal in a moment. That is all it would mean, and I cannot believe that they would accept it for a moment. I am afraid it would produce a very bad impression of what we were after. It would be far better, if you really want to do that, to go to them and say : &quot; We have undertaken under Article 16 obligations which are too big, and we desire them to be reduced,&apos;&apos; and put that proposition, if you have the courage to do so, before the Assembly of the League of Nations. 1 am sure it would be turned down directly, but it would at any rate be a perfectly plain, obvious and straight-forward policy to pursue. But I cannot see that this kind of plan is really a good one. I think it is really a most dangerous suggestion. And may I point out that I think there is a good deal of misapprehension about Article 16 ? It has been interpreted by unanimous Resolutions of the Second Assembly, and those Resolutions go a very long way to satisfy the anxieties which some people apparently feel as to Article 16. It is not to come into operation without a Resolution of the Council which is unanimous. It is not to be put in force uno flatu, the whole thing, it is to be put in force gradually. In the first place by the severance of diplomatic relations and then by Other measures gradually extending them. I cannot think myself that there is a great danger in a thing of that kind. Just consider how it would operate. The Council would decide that a breach of the Covenant had taken place and they would recommend unanimously that on a particular day the pressure should begin. The pressure would take the form, first, of the withdrawal of all diplomatic representatives. If they were not all withdrawn, if a considerable number of Powers declined to carry it out, I cannot think the other Powers would be bound to go on. The whole theory of the thing is that it is to be a general infliction of pressure, and if a large number of people drew back and said that they were not satisfied that the case had arisen, I do not think the others would be bound to go on. In those circumstances practically the only obligation is, if substantially the whole of the people agree that a case for pressure has arisen, will you join them in exerting that pressure ? I think that is the effect of the Article as explained by the resolutions of the Second Assembly. I see that the Foreign Secretary does not agree with me, but I think that is the effect of it, with the unanimous resolutions of the Assembly. At any rate, I feel that an attempt to alter it, if it is to be made at all, should be made quite definitely and clearly.
Now we are asked to-day, and I pass to this because evidently that is what the Committee desire mainly to consider, what we should do in the immediate future. I recognise the immense importance of rapidity of action, from what the Foreign Secretary.has said. On the other hand, I also recognise the immense importance of our not taking any step which will irrevocably commit us to a policy which we may afterwards regret. It is an issue of immense importance that we have to face, and I think, myself, that it would be very rash for us to commit ourselves to any active -or positive policy until we have considered the matter much more fully than it has been considered at present. I hope Lord Balfour will not think I am guilty of disrespect if I say I am not happy about some of the arguments he suggests in his despatch; particularly, I am not happy about the reference to the United States. I do not like our appearing before the world as dependent upon the action of the United States, and, particularly, I am quite sure it is the most fatal thing from the point of view of the United States. The oftener you tell the United States you cannot do anything without their assistance, the less likely they are to give you their assistance. That is their mentality, as I see it, and, therefore, I should myself be content with a much shorter document, merely saying, in effect, that we were unable, as at present advised, to accept the Geneva Protocol, that we were very anxious to find some solution of the problems that have been raised, that we were considering the matter very deeply with our Dominions, and that we were prepared to undertake, at any rate, before the next Assembly, as soon as possible, to make a constructive proposal dealing particularly with the question of Security, and, as I hope, of Disarmament also.LORD BALFOUR,: May I say, incidentally, that I never mentioned the United States on the ground that they are particularly virtuous or even that they are particularly powerful. I mentioned them simply because they happen to have a very big export trade and are in a great financial position, which is a very important consideration when we are dealing with Blockade.LORD CECIL: I agree, although I do not myself think the danger of interference by the United States is as great as some people think. It is really a question of how you are going to word it, to a large extent.LORD BALFOUR : Yes.LORD CECIL : I feel very confident that any direct mention of the United &quot;States of America would do a great deal of harm and is not really at all necessary if you are only going to send a provisional reply at this stage. I do not see why you should go into elaborate arguments about why you cannot accept the Protocol -the line suggested by Lord Balfour really goes a good deal further than that and say we cannot do anything of the kind under any consideration. I should have thought, if we were going to reserve our position and we were going to make merely a provisional answer, it would be too elaborate to lay that down. We ought to explore fully what constructive alternatives we can make, and not shut the door on a whole series of possibilities, which I think would be the result of a despatch of that nature, until we are quite satisfied that we cannot do anything in a practical way. I agree it is important to soothe the French. The really important thing is to try and persuade them that we are going to do something, and you will not soothe the French by sending such a despatch as that sketched out by Lord Balfour. You will not do anything to alleviate their sense of insecurity. They would merely say : &quot;Well, then, we have almost nothing to hope, because on the lines of this despatch it i;-; evident we can hope for almost nothing.&quot;LORD BIRKENHEAD : I very much hope that we shall not send a message to the French or to anybody else, that we are going to make a constructive, practical proposal, until we agree among ourselves and are clear among ourselves as to what that constructive, practical proposal shall be.SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER : May I reinforce that ? I do not want to enter into a discussion of the detailed points which you very rightly have ruled out, but, on the point Lord Birkenhead has raised, when we come to the discussion of these very limited practical proposals which have been put up, I feel I should have to advance arguments to show that they were in themselves very dangerous in their present form to British trade and almost impossible to make effective. I do not in the least Avant to argue that now, but, as one of the few things which are left is the economic sanctions, I want to reinforce Lord Birkenhead&apos;s point that it is dangerous to speak with certainty of a constructive proposal on that side, apart altogether from
security, unless we have considered whether it is worth while to make what is undoubtedly a considerable sacrifice of trade interest.LORD CECIL: May I say that I should be grateful if the Committee would allow me to try and draft such a document as I think we might safely send.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : May I, for the purpose of getting on the record which I see is being taken, and in order that it shall not be forgotten, say I think, in any reply that is sent, we ought to include a reference to that point which specially concerns and preoccupies the Dominions, the question of immigration and the Japanese amendment, w&quot;hich, I think, is not mentioned in your despatch ? I only want to get on the record that, when we are considering any reply, we should consider that question.Mr. AMERY : On the point of our procedure, I am a little inclined to agree with Lord Cecil, that, if we are to send an interim reply to the League of Nations, it should be as brief as possible, simply stating we cannot accept the Protocolin its present form, because any fuller statement will, as Lord Birkenhead pointed out just now, necessarily have to avoid the danger of not being in line with the final policy we decide upon. I have read the most ably phrased document of Lord Balfour, and there are several points in it which make it plain we are not quite in line with the report of the Committee.LORD BALFOUR : I had not seen the report of the Committee.Mr. AMERY : We could not accept a document of that sort or send it to the League of Nations until we had not only ourselves, but in concert with our Dominions, decided on our policy. I do feel, if we send a negative reply, it might be the briefest indication that we have come to the conclusion with the Dominions that we cannot accept the Protocol in its present form and we will make proposals later.Mr. CHURCHILL : That falls into the objections of the Secretary of State for India that you will make future proposals, but you do not know what they will be at all.MR. AMERY : When Lord Cecil says constructive proposals he does throughout mean proposals based in some form on the principle that you can only secure disarma-ment by securities and sanctions. That is the principle on which the League has been working all through and on which certain articles in the Covenant of the League are framed. That does go to the root of the whole matter. There are really two entirely different conceptions of what the League is, and we shall have, before we come to the end of the business, to make up our minds which conception it is. One conception is it is in some form a super-organisation, however mild, a body which can impose certain rules and regulations and exercise its coercive force to prevent war. The other conception is that it is a standing conference, a meeting-place where views can be exchanged, where the public opinion of the world can be exercised to create an atmosphere of security, and thus bring about disarmament, and I am con-vinced that it is only the second method which is worth anything in bringing about disarmament. Schemes of comprehensive security and comprehensive sanctions cannot bring about disarmament, and are really in the long run an obstacle to peace, and any constructive proposals should get right away from that idea, and it seems to me the merit of the suggestions of the Hankey Committee in substance-1 am leaving aside the advantage of the form of amending the Protocol, not to destroy it is that they destroy everything in the Protocol which Lord Cecil would call con-structive. I agree with you they go to the root of the matter, and in the guise of amendments also eliminate things that are in the Covenant of the League itself which he would call constructive.LORD CECIL: I do not confine my meaning of the word &quot;constructive&quot; to that.Mr. AMERY : At any rate, the result of these proposals is to bring the League of Nations more to that Conference to which it would be more likely the other nations and the United States might adhere.Then there is the other side the Foreign Secretary lays such stress on which we shall have to consider. Whether we can give any sort of guarantee outside the Protocol or in the form which Lord Cavan suggested within the amended Protocol. Nobody can deny the reality of the French fear. Nobody can also deny the reality of the reluctance of a large section of opinion in this country and in the
Dominions to give any definite pledge for military action for an indefinite period ahead. I should also like to say about that. I do not believe if we signed any pact that, however, strictly it was worded it would in fact really relieve French apprehem sions. They would soon discover as British Governments changed and various things happened that they were not certain really whether on particular issues that might arise we should not say, no you are in the wrong; we will not come in with you. Is not the only chance of a guarantee of security that will be of any use and be likely to be kept one which is of the kind that we should be willing to announce to the world uni-laterally even if it were not a joint pact, and which has a historical basis for it, that the whole Empire has a vital interest in the communications through the Channel, therefore we have an interest in the low countries, with Belgium in particular. We have guaranteed Belgian security in the past. I think we might very well get this country and the rest of the Empire to subscribe to a renewed declaration that we would not tolerate any interference with the territorial integrity of Belgium, the independence of Belgium, and if we added to that, Luxembourg which is a very small annexe, which would add considerably to French territorial security, because it prolongs the frontier much further southwards, we should give Franee as effective a guarantee as I believe we are likely ever to give her, and there-fore I should be inclined to concentrate generally on the lines of the Committee&apos;s report, but limiting any pact we give to the kind of pact we can justify to the Empire as always permanently justifiable in the interests of British maritime security, make it really the defence of the Low Countries, which very much reduces the French border and makes it defensible against superior numbers.LORD CURZON : You would say nothing about the Rhine frontier in your pact ?Mr. AMBERY : It is reduced to a very small frontier. It is only the bit south of Luxemburg.Then to go back to the method of procedure, it is quite clear that we cannot send out any even preliminary despatch intimating a general future policy until we have agreed the general future policy with the Dominions. Therefore I should be very much inclined to suggest an interim rejection of the Protocol only, saying we were going to bring further proposals, but not specifying in the least Avhat they are.LORD CECIL : I do not see why you should say further proposals. You might say further communications. I do not mind which you do. My own view is you won&apos;t be able to do anything effective really for some months.Mr. CHURCHILL : I seem to gather in the last few sentences exchanged across the table between the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Duchy they were both in agreement that we should send an answer and say we cannot accept the Protocol.LORD CECIL : In its present form.Mr. CHURCHILL : I agree with that entirely.LORD CURZON : That is the proposal of the Committee. It is contained in the latter part of their report.Mr. CHURCHILL : I also agree with the Chancellor of the Duchy that the proposals of the Committee are not in themselves, a satisfactory basis for us to proceed upon. Great efforts have been made to find a solution by the Committee, but the solution is so moderate and so modest necessarily in the attempt to limit the liability of this country that it would never be taken by France as any substitute for strong national armaments. I feel we are really back where we were when this was first discussed here when the Government was formed and we looked at the original proposals of the Protocol. We do not feel we should be justified, in taking these great burdens upon the country in the absence of the United States. That is at the bottom of everybody&apos;s mind and at the back of the arguments of every department. Indefinite as are the liabilities, great as are the dangers, it might be worth while to run the risk if the whole fighting power of the United States were added to our own and all the friends we can get together in Europe. Without that we cannot come to any other conclusion really than the one everyone has come to now and which everyone had in their minds when the subject was first discussed. But when vou come to the question of what answer you should send, how you can convey this conclusion to the outer world, you have the choice between sending a reasoned answer and sending a laconic answer.   We have all agreed we won&apos;t send an insincere
answer, an answer putting the thing off for a few more months, making people think we have some wonderful scheme, when as a matter of fact we have all arrived at a, different conclusion and a very negative conclusion. But as between a reasoned answer and a laconic answer I am strongly in favour of a reasoned answer.LORD CURZON : At this stage?Mr. CHURCHILL: At this stage, I am strongly in favour of a reasoned answer. First of all, because I think that a reasoned answer will tend to bring the United States public opinion more and more into line with our own. Lord Cecil does not agree, but I have an opposite opinion on that point, and I think that Lord Balfour&apos;s despatch, although I quite agree you might easily have to consider the answer to particular arguments, I think it is conceived from the point of view of gathering together a great volume of opinion not only throughout Great Britain and the United States, but throughout the British Empire. I believe if that despatch were read in Australia, in Canada, in New Zealand, as well as over Wide areas of the United States, where after all Lord Balfour has shown himself an unequalled judge of American public opinion in the great matters he has handled over there, I belieVe if this despatch were read it may be altered it would command a very great measure of comprehension and agreement. People would see our difficulties. They would see the justice of our case, and they would also see how vital it is for the United States to take a hand in this business, to come and shoulder their portion of the burden, if the world is to be saved from a renewal of these dangers. I am in favour of a reasoned despatch, not in these words, but on these lines.Then I must say a word on the question to which the Foreign Secretary attached so much importance. Lord Cecil talks of the Protocol as being a sort of great foundation on which you can make your peace if it can be carried through, but he admitted you must have subsidiary agreements in order to procure disarmament. But it is the subsidiary agreements which are really the solid thing. They are really the solid thing, and I always argue you had far better approach the general con-clusions you have in view, the grand conceptions, by taking practical steps along the line of getting first one and then another of these regional agreements, and then welding them together in the structure of a much greater agreement when the world is more reasonable and more peacefully disposed and more balanced than at the present time. I think that is the practical part, but I must admit that I feel it is a tremendous thing to ask the people of this country now, at this juncture, to bind themselves to go to war on the side of France without leaving to us a very full latitude of judging the circumstances and occasion of the quarrel. I have a little changed in my view.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : As far as I have contemplated an arrange-ment it would be one which would leave and must leave the British Government absolute judge of whether we should act or not, and the Belgian Ambassador told me yesterday that is the character of the arrangement between France and Belgium to-day.Mr. CHURCHILL : I do not wish to misrepresent that in any way, but I have a little changed in my view. I was three years ago firm in the wish that we should make good, as it were, the understanding to France on which she gave up her claim to the Rhine frontier, even in the default of the United States. I think that all the experiences we went through in the Poincare epoch and a good deal we see in French policy at the present time makes one feel there is a tremendous risk in our being involved in that way in a policy which will simply keep alive this antagonism between Germany and France. France, with us, would feel strong enough to keep the antagonism alive, and after all, that is what is going to shatter the peace of the world. That is the danger. This war which has occurred between France and Germany several times has broken up the world. What guarantee have we got while things are going as they are that we shall not have another war. In fact, it seems as if we were moving towards it, although it may not be for twenty years, certainly not until Germany has been able to acquire some methods of waging war, chemically or otherwise. I do not think it is good enough at the present time for us to make a. pact a deux with France. With all the disadvantages there are to the opposite course, I would be reluctant to see us do that now. On the other hand, I think if you could get a real peace between France and Germany, it might be worth our while for that purpose and as part of that to run the great risks involved
in signing a new instrument or making a new arrangement, I believe there is a large volume of opinion among thinking men in France which holds that France will be destroyed in another war unless she can make some sort of lasting arrangement of a friendly character with Germany. Of course, I see that cannot be done without a recasting of the arrangements of the Treaty of Versailles as far as the oriental frontiers of Germany are concerned. That again raises questions of the utmost difficulty and questions you could not solve in a few weeks or a few months. I am in favour of our not giving ourselves to France at this stage, but of our indicating that if as part of an arrangement between the three great nations we might well come in as a guarantor or as a partner. If you could, for instance, get France and Germany to make a real peace out of which Germany undoubtedly got not only the immediate evacuation of territories which are being held, but a substantial rectification of her Eastern frontiers, if you could get that, then I think the weight of England might well be thrown in to make that solid and enable it to be achieved. I do not think it is quite so absurd as it sounds. I had a talk to M. Briand when I was in Paris, and I found he had been for some time whole-heartedly in favour of that. At all events, it would avoid our being committed at this stage to an engagement which I am sure would cause enormous misgivings and anxiety throughout wide circles here. I say that, though in public I have defended the signing of a pact.LORD BALFOUR : I understand in a certain sense the immediate question in front of us is between a brief answer and a reasoned answer. Can you avoid the sending of a reasoned answer whatever you do. In fact, will it not be much worse if you send it in the form&apos;of the report of a debate. I am not a member of the House of Commons now, but you cannot avoid a debate on the subject, and if you have a debate you must give your reasons.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I think it is essential to have a reasoned answer, because otherwise there would be a debate on it and I should have to answer with infinitely less skill amidst all the difficulties of the House of Commons; I should state the reasons there infinitely worse than we shall state them in a form which has been passed by this Committee and the Cabinet.Mr. AMERY : A reasoned despatch, giving reasons against signing, but not&apos; containing our future constructive policy ?Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN :  No.Mr. AMERY : That was what I mean. We do not want to give our future policy.LORD BALFOUR : I was only going to say I am afraid that the idea of tearing up the Treaty of Versailles and altering the frontiers of Poland and Czecho-slovakia I think we ought to put that on one side.   I think it is hopeless.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Shall we have to resume this discussion later?LORD CURZON : Certainly. It is now ten minutes past one; we will go on for another quarter of an hour.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I should like very much to have five minutes in which to say something I want the Committee to think of between now and the resumption of our discussion. I am encouraged by what the Chancellor of the Exchequer has just said, even though he put it in the form of a difference of opinion. I think he is much more with me than he appreciates, and that at any rate on certain fundamental principles we are agreed, I agree with him that the real way to promote the peace, which is our object, is by proceeding from the particular to the general, and that the reason why the Covenant fails is.because we undertake equal obligations in respect of matters in which we have a vital concern and matters in which we have no concern whatever, except as one of the society of nations. If you try to promote the peace .of the world by bringing all the countries of the world under exactly the same obligation to defend the Danzig corridor as, for instance^ we might be willing to undertake for the defence of our secular interests in the Low Countries, you are bound to fail. The very generality of your guarantee and the fact that you apply the same thing to the case in which no British Government would ever be able to fight, for instance, the Danzig Corridor if that alone is in dispute, as to a case in which our interests are vitally concerned, and where, document or no document, we must fight, destroys the[12692] d
value of your guarantee. If you do that you will never get * on. Therefore, I start-from the same fundamental basis as :the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I think ybii could perhaps work it bh his principle that it shall -not -be a. simple -Franco-British or Franco-British-iBelgian guarantee, but it shall be we three and Germany guaranteeing the western frontiers of France. That, after all, is the proposal which Stresemann first made in secret toD^Abernon, and now makes in secrecy;to France. I do1 not-think you have to-postpone that until you are ready to tear up the Treaties as they affect Eastern Europe, or; until1 you are ready to complete the evacation of the occupied area, Stresemarin has said distinctly to D&apos;Abernon, in answer to an enquiry raised&apos; i-n a private letter of mine, that his proposals were not intended to be conditional upon the evacuation of the occupied territory. Of course, they would be&apos;worth nothing if you are going&apos;to remain in Cologne, but provided we are&quot;going out of Cologne it is not part of his proposal that we should, in consequence of that proposal, anticipate the fifteen years of the treaty in respect of occupation. That is very important. What is at least as important is that Stresemann himself said that he did&apos;hot see why a&apos;similar arrangement might&apos;not be entered into in respect of the Eastern countries among the Powers- there. - That is a very significant thing.LORD BALFOUR : That is most satisfactory.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : It is a most remarkable thing for him to have offered. I thought it material to call the attention of the Committee to this aspect in the light of what the Chancellor of the Exchequer has said, because I conceive there is a policy which may be practical and which is directed to an attempt to get a regional guarantee of the territories concerned, in which either we should come into it as parties or as guarantors, whatever form we think most suitable, and where we might say that we would use the whole strength of the nation if the case ever arises. You would have another series of cases in the East in which we are not engaged except as general&apos; members of the League of Nations where we take no particular&apos;interest, and then the British Government would be able to say at any moment&apos;to&apos;the: French Government: &quot;Now look here, if you are going.to&apos;get into trouble over Poland, if you are going to allow them to bring you into trouble there, our Western guarantee, remember, doesr not apply to that situation.&quot; I do not say that the British Government, if the French frontier or the Belgian frontier were in such circumstances seriously threatened, might not have to fight to defend them, but I would never tell the French beforehand that I would fight in such circumstances.Mr. CHURCHILL : That would be 1914 over again.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Except that they would know that if the Germans entered Belgium or crossed the French frontier aggressively, not as&apos; a result of a-war&apos;which: France and Belgium had begun in the East, but aggressively, the interest of the British Government is the same as that of the French Government. The only other observation I want to make is, you cannot appreciate the report of Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s Committee unless you mean, as I think the Committee clearly meant something of this kind to follow upon Article 7, or to accompany Article 7. It is Article 7 which is not the guarantee itself, but the procedure which wall give them the guarantee, and it should be a guarantee on the lines suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.; LORD BIRKENHEAD : There seem to be two points. The first is to discover what is to&apos; be our constructive&apos; programme. The other point is&apos; to prepare an answer to! France. I think it is agreed that when we answer France we shall not say we are going&apos; to make them&apos; any constructive proposals. Lord Cecil was good enough- to say he would draft suggestions for the possible form of a reply to France before we meet again. Is it not obvious&apos; that- must have a suggested draft as the basis of our discussion?  T do not know whether the Foreign Minister could make a draft.lord CURZON: T was going to make proposals on that line. We have had a very important discussion which we - must clearly resume, but I think it is possible to arrive at certain tentative&apos;conclusions. First, as to procedure. Two suggestions have been; placed before us. One ! is the suggestion of Lord Cecil, which really follows the report of Sir Maurice HankeyV Committee, that we should at the present stage send a reply expressing no opinion at all, but indicating that we are going to send something later on. As against that, a proposal has been1 made that a reasoned1 reply-should1 be sent. I hold strongly to the latter opinion, not&apos;merely on the-grounds&quot;stated by the-Foreign Secretary that he will be forced to give a reasoned reply-in the!House of Commons, but because I think,the public opinion of the world
and of our Dominions will expeet it, and it willbe^regarded as merely evading the issue if we say we are not going to accept the Protocol without stating the grounds upon which we are not going to accept it. On that point I hope, therefore, that the Foreign Secretary will accept Lord Birkenhead&apos;s suggestion and submit to us at a future meeting Lord Balfour&apos;s draft as the basis of another draft perhaps by the Foreign Olfico. -This is, in the main, a Eoreign Office matter. We are anxious to follow: the lead of the Foreign Secretary upon the matter, and he may be able at our next meeting to give us a revised draft as a basis of discussion.Now, upon the other and larger point raised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, may I say a word, because it is a matter with which I had a great deal to do. I am entirely of his opinion that if at the present moment we gave the sort of guarantee to France that we wanted to do and were on the verge of doing when Mr. Lloyd George and myself were discussing the matter with M. Briand and M. ^Poihcare, we should find great difficulty in securing the requisite amount of public support.You must remember that though we have a big majority and can carry through the House of Commons pretty well what we wish, it is very desirable in this matter that you should have the nation behind you, and I am very much afraid that if we were to make an offer of this sort that could be regarded as at all dangerous or military or aggressive in character, we should at once unite the Liberal and Labour Parties against us. I see every indication, for instance, in the &quot;Manchester Guardian,&quot; that * the Liberal Piarty, of which Party that paper is much the most able exponent, is prepared to take that line. We must not on an occasion of this kind divide;the nation. I see no difficulty in getting the nation to back us provided we - do - not lay ourselves&apos; open to this suspicion. Of all the suggestions that have been made, the one that appeals to me most strongly, and I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself favoured it just now, is that which would bring into any obligation that was entered into or any guarantee that was accepted, Germany as well as France and Belgium. That, I believe, would disarm suspicion to a very wide extent1 indeed,1 and might provide the basis of an agreement. The other sugges-tion that was made was that the neutrality and inviolability of Belgium should once again be guaranteed. The history of this matter is very curious. During the war, and while I Was- at&apos;the Foreign Office after the war, the Belgians were the one people who wanted to get rid of the guarantee, and their reasons were two-fold. Firstly, because it had failed in the conspicuous case of the German violation at the beginning of the war, and secondly,-because they thought that their position in the world would be better established, sounder and more honourable to themselves, if they were not picked out among the nations of Europe as requiring this sort of guarantee in order to preserve the integrity of their territory. I believe they have somewhat changed their opinion since. They are nervous. But I think we ought to pause before we again introduce into the public law of Europe any arrangement which so eon-conspicuously failed on the last occasion, and as to which people might say you are falling back upon a form of protection which has already turned out to be quite illusory.   However, I only offer that in passing.My second set of observations comes to this. While I suggest that the Foreign Secretary should submit to us for our next meeting a draft of the kind of reasoned reply he would like to send, I suggest that he should also prepare the kind of draft arrangement that he would have in view supposing Germany, France, Belgium and ourselves were to enter into any agreement in future as to the safety of their frontiers. The Foreign Office, no doubt, have thought over this matter. I attach, as he does, enormous weight to what the German Government is saying and doing at the present time. I think we ought to seize.this favourable opportunity. It gives us a chance which we have never had before. You have got a friendly Minister in France; you have for the first time a reasonable Minister in Germany. It is an extraordinary combination. I think we should take advantage of it and draw up in some concrete form the ideas that have been discussed to-day. That is the only contribution I have to make at the moment. I hope it may be helpful to the next meeting.Mr. CHURCHILL : Would it be possible for the Secretary to draw up and circulate a few of the conclusions on principle arising out of our discussion, so that our discussion this morning may not evaporate, the idea of approaching the topic from the particular to the general, certain things which have emerged from the discussion and which it would be advantageous if we could have for discussion afterwards.   Who agreed with which side and who with the other.
LORD CECIL : I would like if I may to add this to what the Foreign. Secretary has said. I hope if he wishes to carry the nation with him he won&apos;t forget that it is very important to bring the League of Nations somehow into all these arrangements. Secondly, I think it would !be of immense value from my point of view, at any rate, -if you could make some kind of skeleton framework into which some of these arrange-ments could be fitted, not involving any serious obligations on us beyond considering it later on. Thirdly, of course, I do want somehow or another not to lose sight of disarmament, because that again is a matter of immense public interest, not only in this country, but all over the world.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I entirely agree with all of that. The object of Article VII of the Committee&apos;s report I am interpreting their intentions and not merely their words is to link up all these arrangements directly under the League. They would thus become for the particular regions the most effective part of the League machinery. As to disarmament, I entirely agree. I am not losing sight of that.SIR SAMUEL HOARE : I do not want to delay the Committee. I assume we shall go on with the general discussion at our next meeting. I have some observations I should, like to make.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS : I am in the same position.SIR SAMUEL HOARE : May I throw out a further suggestion to the Foreign Secretary when he is thinking of this draft ? Whether it would not be possible to make the framework of such a kind that you would get into this pact for Western Europe not only the belligerents in the late war, but countries like Holland as well. I think if you could do that from the point of view of the League of Nations it would have an immense effect.The Committee agreed That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be requested to prepare for consideration by the Committee  i(a.) A draft despatch to the League of Nations, which might be, in the main,based on the draft despatch by Lord Balfour, contained in C.I.D. PaperNo. 581-B, and(&amp;.) A draft instrument showing how he would give effect to the tentative suggestion of an agreement between the British Empire, France, Belgium and Germany.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, February 13, 1925.o

REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS. PACIFIC SETTLEMENT  OF  INTER-NATIONAL DISPUTES.-FRENCH AND BELGIAN SECURITY. (Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of 195fh Meeting.) (Stenographic Notes.)LORD CURZON : It was understood that at our Meeting to-day the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for Air desired to make some observa-tions on the general question. The Secretary of State for War has not yet arrived, so I will ask Sir Samuel Hoare if he will favour us with his views.SIR SAMUEL HOARE : I do not want to take up the time of the Committee or to go over arguments that have already been made, but there are one or two things I should like to say. There are two things which I have in view : first of all, to avoid stereotyping the existing divisions in Europe, which seems to me to be the real danger  a danger much greater than the danger of German aggression; and, secondly, somehow or other to get a reduction of armaments. That affects me very directly, being responsible for an armament that looks like developing enormously in the next ten or twenty years, and may really go a long way to destroy civilisation unless we can get some reduction of armaments. As to the first object, the object of avoiding the stereotyping of existing divisions in Europe, it does seem to me to be extraordinarily dangerous for us now to take any action that is going to tie us up, first of all, with the existing system in Europe, and, secondly, with a Power that is getting weaker and weaker as Germany gets stronger and stronger. If my colleagues will recall the figures I ventured to quote in a Note I circulated to the Committee, they will remember that in the course of the next generation the German population is going to be twice the French population, and in the course of two generations the German population is going to be three times the size of the French population, according to calculations made by the General Staff. If that is so, it does seem to me to be a very strong argument for going very cautiously with any kind of definite pact, military or otherwise, with the French or Belgians alone. Personally, with things as they are, I should prefer to do nothing. I believe that public opinion here is strongly against any kind of commitment. I believe that public opinion in the Dominions is even more strongly against it. Further, I believe that all the big forces in Europe which are really going to matter in the future, which are economic rather than political, are working in the direction of bringing countries together without the necessity of these particular pacts. I think there is even some evidence that that is going on that can be drawn from the events of the last three or four years. Upon the whole, the things that have mattered have been the economic forces, the need of Germany, say, to get capital from outside, and the need of the various countries to do trade with each other. I am inclined to think myself that, if we could do nothing, and leave these big economic forces to develop, the kind of difficulties that loom so large to-day would loom a great deal less conspicuously in the next few years. But supposing that course of conduct is impossible, and that one has got to do something, then I very much hope that we shall not involve ourselves directly or indirectly in any kind of pact with France and Belgium alone. Even with the modification suggested by Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s Committee, I think there are a good many strong drawbacks to it. I am very much afraid that that kind of declaration would be just as unpopular here as something more definite. I think it would not please the extreme right of the Conservative Party, who want a definite military pact, and I think it would raise against it all the. forces which do not want any kind of commitment amongst our own party and amongst other parties. I think also that, so far as the world is concerned, it would be regarded, if I may say so, as rather a disingenuous declara-tion, that we were dangling in front of the eyes of our own people the Channel Ports in order to bring in the Dominions, but that at the back of it there is the guarantee of the territorial status quo on the eastern frontier of France to try and get the French to accept it. I should be inclined to think, if I may say so with great deference, that, if we are going to have anything of that kind, it would have been much better to have had not a bilateral pact of that kind, but unilateral declarations by countries upon their own responsibility a unilateral declaration made by us, a unilateral declaration at the same time by Germany, and a further declaration made, if possible, by a neutral country like Holland, which really has got as much to gain from stability in Western Europe as anybody else has. As to the actual procedure that
we discussed last week, which I gather is going to be discussed again, there, again, I would venture to make the following suggestions : First of all, I would suggest, with great deference, particularly in view of the extraordinarily able draft of Lord Balfour, with the small amendments by the Foreign Office, that it would be wiser to make a short answer now, in view of the Meeting of the Council of the League which is going to take place in March, and to say that we see no chance of ratifying the Protocol in its present form, but not going much further than that.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Giving no reasons?SIR SAMUEL HO ARE : Yes; and in the meanwhile; we should try to get a generally agreed statement between ourselves and the Dominions. I think a statement coming from us and the Dominions, even though it tears the Protocol to pieces, would carry much more weight with the world than a partial statement from this Government here. I think that will take time. I should not mind it taking time. I should rather like, if it were possible, that the Protocol should have been turned down not by our isolated action now, but at the Annual Meeting of the Assembly next September. I believe myself that during the next three or four months many of the countries that have given a kind of vague adherence to it will see the difficulties in it. If we could wait until then we should find a great body of countries against it, and we should not put ourselves into the position of killing it from here now. I am quite aware that the suggestion of delays of this kind raises a number of obvious obstacles the difficulty of dealing with the French in the meanwhile over all sorts of questions that constantly arise. At the same time, it does seem to me to be so big a question and fraught with such immense importance over the next, not ten or fifteen years, but forty or fifty years, that I would, quite apart from the detailed proposals that I have ventured to suggest, press upon the Committee as strongly as I can my view, that we ought to go very cautiously.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS : I do not think I need address the Committee at any length, because I gather that the general view of the Committee is that the Protocol, for the various reasons which we considered last time, is not acceptable and that the trend of the Committee&apos;s view is in favour of the despatch . which Lord Balfour has drafted, about which the Foreign Office have made some slight suggestions, and that we do intend subsequently to-day to consider that despatch and probably approve it. I need not waste any time on the grounds on which I agree that the Protocol cannot be accepted by us, and why, in my judgment, it is also incapable of amendment.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that this country to-day and the Empire at large is not prepared to enter into any binding commitment either with France or with Belgium.    I think it is quite likely that a large section of this country is not prepared to do so, and very possibly the Empire is not prepared to do so.   If they are backward in accepting such a course, it is because they do not understand the necessity.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has drawn up a short paper which, if the Committee likes, I will circulate, to ask us to impress upon ourselves the fact that it is not merely for the security of France and Belgium that such a pact is desirable, but that it is desirable in our own. proper interests. He points out that our national frontiers are not any longer they have not been for some time the place where land meets water, but that to-day they are wider afield than ever they have been owing to the air menace; and to us it is essential not merely that the Channel Ports should not be in hostile occupation, but that as large an area beyond the sea on the Continent shall be freed from use as a, base for air attack, and that therefore it is not merely to procure security or a sense of security in the minds of the French and Belgians, but it is for ourselves also a matter of primary importance that something should be done- to secure these Ports and to prevent any near territory being used as a base for air attack.    If the people of the country understand that, if the Empire understands that, it seems to me there is quite likely to be less opposition to such a pact than has been contemplated. How that is best impressed upon the country, how the attention of the Empire should be called to these facts, is a matter for further consideration, but to my mind it is a reason not for being put off by what are obvious difficulties in getting the whole of the country to be of one mind upon the subject, but it is a ground really for further expressing the knowledge which we ourselves have and of imparting that to the public.My conclusion is therefore, I entirely agree that the Protocol is not acceptable, that we ought as quickly as we can--I agree it is not perhaps an immediate thing,.[12723] b 2
but it should not be postponed any longer than it need be to endeavour to find some meeting place with France and Belgium in a pact.LORD CECIL : Do you exclude Germany ?SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS : I do for the moment.   I think it is impossible that we should at the same moment be saying to Germany :  &quot;We ^cannot: trust you; we are still occupying your territory, and yet we do trust you &quot;to the extent of entering into a Treaty with you for the purpose of mutual security.&quot; The Treaty should be in such a form that Germany can adhere, I agree, but I do not think it is useful, or even possible, for her to be asked to adhere at this moment.LORD CURZON : You referred to a paper which I think you said had been drawn up by the Chief of the Staff.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS : Yes.LORD CURZON : I hope you will circulate it. It will be useful to this Committee, but as the Chief of the Staff is here, and as the professional heads of the Services have not spoken, perhaps it would be well that they should give us their views.LORD CAVAN : I have really nothing to add to what the Secretary of State for War has said. I think he has given the Committee the gist of the paper I have prepared. It seems to me the security of Great Britain has been rather left out of this very big question. The way the problem appears to me is this. I am quite certain that the public of this country do&apos; not realise that you cannot defend a place like Calais or Boulogne and the Channel Ports on the other side by digging a trench round them and sitting in it. I am sure the idea of the bulk of the people is, you have only to select a line, put up some wire and put in some trenches, and that defends the place. What they should be told is that it was the First Battle of Ypres which saved the Ports in the last war, which is roughly 40 miles from Calais, and with the development of modern armament speed, especially in the air, the next battle to defend the Channel Ports may well have to be fought 150 miles away. I think it is most important that should be impressed upon the public. If I may say so I do not look upon it as dangling, as the Secretary of State for Air said, as dangling this argument in order to try and get the public in. I believe it will be a real menace to this country if Germany should place herself in such a position that she can make a serious air threat against us. In regard to the bringing in of Germany now into a quadrupal pact, I certainly think, as the Secretary of State for War said, at present we are demanding money from her and demanding a good deal in regard to the limitation of her forces, w*e are occupying her country and we propose to go on doing so. I am sure the French would very much object to tearing up the Versailles Treaty, and we propose going on occupying her territory for another ten years. I do not see how you can possibly say, &quot; Will you come and join in a little Treaty not to fight,&quot; while all these things are going on. If you bring her in you are bound to drop these sanctions and treaty obligations which other countries would not listen to for a minute, and I do not think it would be wise to listen to it ourselves.Mr. BRIDGEMAN : We are in general agreement with this draft.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD : I do not think there is any danger at the moment, but I do not think you should tie yourself by a pact to a country which in fifteen years is going down hill continuously, a country which is antagonistic and has piled up all this feeling against Germany. By doing that you automatically make Germany a certain menace for us in the future. I think from the air point of view, tying ourselves to France, in fifteen, twenty or thirty years&apos; time it will be disastrous, from the point of view of this country and it is bound to antagonise Germany. That is really all I have to say.LORD BALFOUR : May I ask a question? Are these prophesies about the relative strength of France and Germany based on anything but a consideration of the way the population has moved in the last generation, and assuming that that relative rate of change will! go on in the indefinite future? Is that a legitimate supposition?SIR SAMUEL HO ARE : I was taking the figures from a paper prepared for the Committee by the General Staff. I am not quite sure what was the basis it was prepared on.  It is a Staff paper.
Mr. CHURCHILL: For twenty years on it depends on the births that have already taken place, the military manhood is a certainty.SIR SAMUEL HOARE : It occurs to me really in this light. That assuming that a pact is going to have a limited duration for the next fifteen years, France is as safe as any country has ever been in-the history of the world. After that fifteen years France is getting weaker and weaker, whatever the actual figures of population may be, while Germany is getting stronger and stronger.LORD BALFOUR : That is based on what has happened. There is no alteration possible in that period.SIR SAMUEL HOARE :  None.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I have seen those figures. I am asking for a little more information about them myself because even assuming that you could know the facts exactly for a period of years and that you could work out the pro-portion if the same rate of increase in Germany and decrease in France continues, it does not appear to me at all to follow that as the population of France diminishes the birth-rate will remain where it is now, or that as the population and the pressure of population in Germany increases the birth-rate in Germany will remain what it is now.LORD BALFOUR : That is exactly my point.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN: I think it is exactly your point, and it seems to me at any rate as regards Germany, the inference is the other way. The German birth rate is likely to slow down.SIR LAMING-WORTHINGTON-E VANS : In any&apos;case you are not taking into acount the black troops which the French employ.SIR SAMUEL HOARE : Even so, the fact does, remain that for the next fifteen years there is France stronger and safer than any country has ever been, as far as I know, in the history of Europe. After fifteen years whatever the ratio may be, German population will be much bigger than France whatever the exact amount may be.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : May I say something on the discussion which has taken place to-day. The first thing that I would like to say is that I do not think that it would be possible for any Foreign Minister to take the view of the value of time expressed by the Secretary of State for Air. The lack of a settlement on this question, the lack of any clear policy by the British Empire is really one of the very disturbing factors in the present European conditions, and hardly a Foreign Minister comes to see me who does not at some time in the course of his discussion raise this question of &quot;what is vour British policy, the fate of all of us depends on it.&quot;LORD BALFOUR : All these neutrals?Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN: Take Sweden-the Swedish Minister-I dined at the Polish Ministers house last night, the Swedish Minister buttonholed me as soon as I left the dining room and with difficulty I escaped from his clutches. I said : &quot; You must give me time.&quot; He replied : &quot; Europe cannot give you time with your plea about the British Empire. It is not possible. I do not know the solution, but you must find a solution by which the British Empire will take decisions rapidly.&apos;&apos; Sir Eyre Crowe tells me the Norwegian Minister spoke in the same sense to him 3^esterday. Apart from the Balkan States, the Eastern States and apart from France and Belgium, I feel confident many of the interviews I am asked to give to these Ambassadors and Ministers ostensibly on this question or on that really have their purpose in what is worked in at the end or half way through, &quot;what are you doing about Security.&quot; It really is urgent for the peace of the world in my opinion I am not putting it too highly if I say for the peace of the world that the British Govern-ment and the British Empire should declare its policy as early as possible. Let me say that the private letters that I get from Lord d&apos;abernon in Berlin and Lord Crewe in Paris confirm this urgency from another point of view. We never know what will happen to Governments in these other countries. At the present time it is Lord d&apos;abernon&apos;s conviction that you have a Government in Germany which can.
settle some of these questions, and certainly I do not think you are likely to have a more pacific Government or1 one more anxious to find a reasonable solution than exists at present in Paris. Sir Eyre Crowe said to me a moment ago that he profoundly differed from the view that we had plenty of time and that there was no disadvantage in delay. He said that if we allowed the thing to drift on he would consider there was a real danger of serious complications. Well, the second observation which I wish to make is to express my profound gratitude for the promise of the paper which the Chief of the General Staff has prepared. I agree entirely with the statements made by the Secretary of State for War and the Chief of the General Staff that in considering this Protocol in the &quot; atmosphere of Geneva &quot; (if I may use the cant phrase), we are in danger of overlooking the fact that vital British interests are concerned in the question of security which do not find their expression or their protection in the Protocol, but which must be the dominating factor in the selection and pursuit of any policy by the British Empire. I have myself just passed for print this morning a memorandum, a very able memorandum prepared under my directions, and of course under the supervision and with the assistance of Sir Eyre Crowe by Mr. Harold Nicolson of the Eoreign Office. I am going to circulate that to the Cabinet and if the Secretary of State for the Colonies approves I think it should go to the Dominions. It is an endeavour to consider British policy in the light of the European situation. It may be a matter of great anxiety to us that the German population should be increasing and the French population should be decreasing, but if there has been any single thread running through British policy through generations, it is that British interest which demands that we should defend the Channel ports and we have got to defend them in the light of to-day&apos;s conditions, not in the light of the conditions of the past. When we talk about the guarantee of the French Eastern frontier, we are talking of the guarantee of our own frontier  the-only place where we can defend our own frontier. There is as direct a British interest in defending that frontier as there is a French interest. That is the view I hold strongly. I will get this paper out to the committee and the Cabinet as soon as I can. I gather the paper prepared by the Chief of the Staff will point to the same conclusion. The Chief of the Air Staff objects that any policy of this kind makes it certain we shall quarrel with Germany. He will permit me to say that that of course is an expression of opinion upon a political problem not on a military problem, and while I would not dispute with him on aircraft strategy, I feel that I am justified in expressing my profound dissent from that view. It is at least open to doubt, if it is not extremely probable, that there might have been no war in 1914 had Lord Grey been in a position to say plainly before the critical decisions were taken that Great Britain would fight if France or Belgium were attacked. As it is certain that presently German strength will revive; as it is certain that unless two factors are present when Germany has again reached that point at which she can challenge the issue, she will challenge that issue, our.whole policy ought to be directed to the cultivation of those two factors in the interval. The first factor is making the position of Germany tolerable, so that she may lose something of her bitterness and forget something of her humiliation, so that when the time comes when she can challenge the hazards of war again, she may at least feel that she has a great deal to lose, and that what she has to lose should not be lightly staked. The second factor is that she should feel that if she contemplates trying to tear up by force the existing settlement of Europe, she will have against her so formidable an opposition that, having regard to what she has to lose, it is not worth her while to run the risk. On the effective realisation of these two conditions I believe, the peace of the world, not for fifteen years, but the peace of the world in our children&apos;s and our grandchildren&apos;s time depends. I hold, therefore, that both our direct British interest in pursuit of our secular policy in regard to the narrow seas and the interests of world peace depend upon easing the situation in regard to Germany at the earliest possible moment. It ought to be done now. In the second place I hold it to be necessary to make clear to Germany that she had better not challenge the risks of war again. I will just say one thing more. I am afraid I have said it often before, but I must repeat it to complete the argument as I am stating it now. The more I see of French policy, the more clearly I see what difficulties we are going to meet almost immediately unless the French get rid of the fears which now obsess them. I think M. Herriot&apos;s policy in regard to the evacuation of Cologne has become fairly clear. He is going to stand wholly on the Treaty. When we discuss the evacuation of Cologne round the table it will be in terms of the Treaty, but the terms of the Treaty will never be fulfilled.   He could
prolong the occupation for ever without stepping outside the fulfilment of the terms of the Treaty. If you want him to be reasonable, if you want him to consent only to concentrate on those demands which are really important and to evacuate as soon as those are fulfilled, you have, outside the door if not inside the room, to say something to him on this question of security.Mr. CHURCHILL : I thought we were going to-day to have two questions before us-LORD CURZON : May I, before you begin, ask Mr. Chamberlain whether he is going to say anything about what the Foreign Office have done since our last meeting in pursuit of the general instructions, or rather suggestions, made to them&apos;?Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : As you will see, we have gone through Lord Balfour&apos;s draft, and I am sure the Committee will not be surprised to find that, after reading it through very carefully again and again, we thought the less we altered it the better it would be. The alterations of substance that I have made are very few, and they are all indicated by a difference of type for convenience of reference in the new copy. In the first-place, I have put in what I thought was a feature to which we ought to draw attention, a few words on the first page at the end of the first paragraph, saying that it is too exclusively framed from the point of view of the European land Powers, and that it takes too little account of the position of a maritime Empire. The second is an insertion emphasising what Lord Balfour does say in three lines in a later passage, namely, that there is a danger in the course which the League Assembly took of converting the Covenant which was &apos; intended to be machinery for guaranteeing peace into the machinery for waging war. I attach the more importance to saying that because, as it seems to me, it is the most pacific of our critics among public men who are most urgently bent upon this movement, and we had better bring them face to face with what they are doing. Then, in between those two there is a sentence put in at the bottom of the first page and the top of the second which refers to the treatment of the immigration question, the Japanese amendment. I thought that any document which attempted to state an Empire view and which did not include a question upon which such strong views are taken in the Dominions would be incomplete.LORD CURZON : Where is that ?Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : At the bottom of page 1 and the top of page 2. There is one other alteration on the last page which I think indicates some difference of intention between myself and Lord Balfour. It is the striking out of the words &quot;neither brought into being before they are wanted nor continued when the need for them has ceased.&quot; I do not want them continued when the need for them has ceased, but &quot;not brought into being before they are wanted.&quot;LORD BALFOUR: I deliberately meant that to give you a really good reason for not going ahead with France at once.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : You see I think that is a wrong policy.LORD BALFOUR: Quite.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : If you are going to wait until Germany has become a danger before you consent to talk about a guarantee, I think your whole policy in the meantime the policy I have intimated at any rate will be impossible. I think France will go on provoking and aggravating Germany, exercising her Treaty rights to the utmost and in the harshest way, and I believe it will be impossible to get any sort of correlation between the policy of France and this country. More than that; I will again refer to the years before the war when the danger was already imminent. I once went to Lord Grey in those days to urge that we had all the obligations of an alliance without its advantages; that we did not get the influence with France that a definite engagement would have given us, and therefore Ave did not get the control over her policy which such an alliance might have given; and yet, fatally and for our own interests, we should be forced to fight if war broke out. On the other hand, Germany, so clumsy in its diplomacy, was not convinced that we should fight, probably thought that we should not, and
-might; at any moment blunder into a position out of which she could not get without either humiliation or war. In that case, her choice would be war; and in the last place, 1 added that: we had, in fact, already once brought our people up to the very brink of war Avithout a conception on their part of what their obligations were.or upon Avhat our own safety depended. Therefore, in our interest, I argued it Avould be for the peace of the world and in our own interest and was due to our own people that we should turn the Entente into a formal alliance. Lord Grey gave me tAvo objections. He did not talk about any internal difficulties that there might be, but his objections were two : one that it might make the French too high flown, and the other that the situation was so critical that action of that kind might just tip the scales on the side of war. If you wait until the danger is imminent you are always open to the same objection, and very probably it will always be a vital objection. . The only way of making a pact of this kind is to make it when the danger is not yet acute, not to leave it till the moment when it is almost as menacing and provocative an act as an act of mobilisation.LORD CURZON : Would you say what steps you have taken on this point, the drawing up of a draft Pact between Belgium, France, Germany and England ?Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I have some drafts, but I did not like at this stage toproduce them. I think it would not be very helpful until I can see my way a little more clearly. For one thing, there is the very big question, if you have any kind of pact and you wish at some stage to introduce Germany, are you prepared to guarantee the German frontier? We have no interest in the German frontier. We have a direct British interest in guaranteeing the French frontier. I want a little guidance on that, and so I have not produced anything at the present time.LORD BIRKENHEAD : May I ask what we are hoping to decide to-day? I thought it Was, in the first place, to decide upon the form of the Reply, and the matter of the Protocol. I do not think there is the slightest hope of reaching a conclusion to-day, as far as this Committee is concerned, on the question of the Pact. I think it is extremely improbable we should. I Avould like to know, for my own guidance, are we invited to-day to discuss the general matter of the Pact ? It seems to me to be a very large subject.LORD CURZON : My own view about our discussion to-day was this. You will remember at our last meeting several members of the Committee expressed their views upon the general question, and at the end of the meeting the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for Air, who had not had an opportunity of doing so, said they would like to take the occasion to-day. Accordingly, we heard them at the commencement of our proceedings, and they were followed by the Chief of the Staff. Then the natural course to follow was for the Foreign Secretary to comment ^ if he chose to do so, upon anything they had said, and to explain to us to what extent he had been able to act upon the general suggestions that were submitted to him last week. That he has noAV done, and I imagine the question before us to-day is whether we are to proceed upon Lord Balfour&apos;s draft as amended, and the observations of the Committee should be directed to that point. Lord Cecil, who will speak presently, I believe has something to say about the policy in general, about the policy of sending a draft of this description, and I think that, sooner than diverge into a general examination of the question of security, our observations had better be directed to the point whether we are to send a draft at all, and, if so, whether this draft, or any other form of draft in its place.Mr. CHURCHILL : I was going to ask very much the same question. I thought we had come here to settle this draft, this paper. I am personally entirely in agreement with it. If that were the view of the Committee, I should entirely associate myself with it, that it should be published as our view on the Protocol discussions that have been taking place.LORD CURZON : Of course, it could not be published Avithout the consent of the Dominions,Mr. CHURCHILL : At the appropriate time, I meant, I certainly am not. prepared at all to come to a conclusion, or even to be gathered into the current towards a conclusion,, on this tremendous problem, on which the Foreign Secretary has spoken to us in words of such gravity.   I should like to say that, while I think I
agree with him in the end, I do believe that the time factor does not. at any rate from a layman&apos;s point of view-1 have heard the Foreign Office view-the time factor does not press immediately. I think you may have France in a much better state of mind in the course of two or three years, and that an opportunity may occur, possibly not waiting so long as fifteen years, an opportunity may occur When you will get a better and more general solution. I do not wish to discuss this any further now because it is not before us to-day. I think we must go on to discuss it and have some opinion on the subject at a very early date, but my own feeling is that time may be on our side in the matter. I do not say an indefinite period of time, but certainly a longer period of time than apparently is envisaged at present.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I want to make the point clear. I am vitally afraid that the whole situation would be poisoned and even ruined by the French remaining--Mr. CHURCHILL : On the Rhine.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN :  In Cologne.Mr. CFIURCHILL : On the other hand, of course, you may be quite sure that, whether they remain in Cologne or not, whether their policy is the pacification of Cermany or the irritation of Germany, nevertheless, French anxieties will be continuous and increasing, and that increasing French anxiety will make them all the more desirous of obtaining our assistance. We may be in a position at a later date to procure from the French concessions to Germany of a far more sweeping character than any they contemplate at the present time, which would be the foundation of a stable peace. We might be running a tremendous risk in attaching our signature to a pact of this kind. That is the only point. I admit the tremendous difficulty of it and I am very glad we are not going to discuss it to-day, although I think we ought to go boldly on and face it in the discussions which are to take place. I do not think we can leave it altogether.LORD BIRKENHEAD : I hold entirely the same view. I do think it will be necessary for us to consider this question, but obviously not to-day, and I make a complete reservation as to my own position about the Pact. As to this memorandum, I am in entire agreement with this.Mr. AMERY : I make the same reservation as the Secretary of State for India. As regards the question of the Pact, I will not express my views on it to-day, but there is one point I should like to refer to, and that is the time factor. Obviously, so big a departure of policy as a Pact cannot be decided by correspondence with the Dominions. You would have to have a conference. I do not think it is possible to have a conference this year, and, therefore, I think it is clear that we cannot come to a conclusion on such a, subject as the Pact without a conference some time towards the middle of next year. I will leave that. I simply put that difficulty as I see it. To come to the actual document, there are two points I want to ask about. On page 4, the middle, there is a paragraph which suggests that security might be reached &quot; from the side unsuccessfully attempted in 1923.&quot; Does that mean on the lines of something akin to the Treaty of Mutual Assistance 1LORD BALFOUR : I think it is rather an obscure statement. Lord Cecil is more competent to speak about it than I am. In 1923 1 understand they tried to meet the sort of difficulties in which we find ourselves now by this great regional arrange-ment. You remember it was by continents, and I remember making a speech in the House of Lords in which I said we really could not assent to that because it cut up the British Empire. The British Empire is in all continents, and, therefore, a continental arrangement was one which we could not accept. That was my view, speaking as a private individual. But I said the proper course is to do what is being done, what is in train now^ which is what is actually embodied in this.Mr. AMERY : May I suggest that the present wording implies that you really want to go back to the Treaty of Mutual Assistance. Could not the wording be altered so as to make it clear that this is not so ?LORD BALFOUR : I am personally against the Treaty of Mutual Assistance and have publicly explained why.[12723]  &apos; c
Mr. AMERY: On the sub]ect of regional agreements, there is no reason why we should join in a European regional agreement?LORD BALFOUR : No. If it is agreed to leave that out. The actual wording could be &quot;&quot;mutual arrangement.&quot;Mr. AMERY : There is another point on the first page near the end of the second paragraph. ; It says &quot; we are not opposed in principle to schemes for clarifying the meaning of the Covenant or strengthening its provisions.&quot; I am afraid that would imply that we are in favour of the attempt which previous makers of protocols have made, to harden the terms of the Covenant in the sense of making Clause. 16 more definite and more rigid.   If that is the meaning I should very strongly oppose that.LORD BALFOUR :  It is the word &quot; strengthening &quot; you object to. &apos;Mr. AMERY : Both clarifying and strengthening.LORD BALFOUR :  You object in principle to clarifying ?Mr. AMERY : In the sense in which it will be generally understood, in the direction of the effort which has been made by the French during the last two or three years to make those provisions more precise instead of leaving them as vague as possible.LORD BALFOUR : My view is very much your point of view. I think the Covenant, as it stands is inevitably imperfect, and would have been so under any circumstances, but it is made doubly imperfect by the fact that since the Covenant was made one of the Great Powers who helped to make it has gone out of it, so that it is absurd to say that the Covenant is a perfect instrument, for it is not. I am fully confident that the more we leave it alone the better it will be for the present.Mr. AMERY:, Yes, and therefore I would suggest that we leave out that part of the sentence.Mr, AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : But do you not rather misunderstand Lord Balfour&apos;.s . use of. the, word &quot;strengthening&quot;? I understand his conception of &quot;strengthening&quot; is, to make what remains more effective by eliminating vague but very far-reaching commitments. At present we have vague obligations which we cannot fulfil.   That is not strength.Mr. AMERY : I was drawing attention, really to the interpretation which would commonly be given to it. But I would add that I feel a little doubt about the whole document. I feel that it is very desirable to be frank with Europe about this business, and that we ought to say clearly, as regards the two interpretations of the Covenant of the League, of Nations about which the underlying struggle is really taking place, that we do not take the interpretation which makes it a rigid scheme or do anything to give encouragement to the idea that disarmament can be based.upon schemes of security and mutual pacts of guarantee; that we do regard the League of Nations as a meeting-place for improving the general tone and atmosphere of international relationships, and so helping disarmament. I do feel a certain doubt ahout Lord Balfour&apos;s draft, just because it will not, I think, really clarify our position. I should like to make really clear to Europe that we cannot be parties to any schemes for interpreting the Covenant of the League in the sense in which France and certain other Powers have been trying to interpret it ever since the League was started. Our view of the League is definitely as a standing Con-ference in order to smooth out international relationships, and not as a sort of scheme by which Powers are pledged to military action in defence of a ^particular status quo, and therefore that armaments can be reduced by strengthening the Covenant. The whole of that conception seems to me to be wrong, but so long as we are not clear in our answer to these other Powers ....Mr. CHURCHILL : Have you not changed your view ? At the start you thought the Protocol had possibilities, and that we should be careful in stating our case not to kill all those hopes. Now you are going further than those of us who were sceptical of the Protocol at the beginning, and you go to the point of the League of Nations being reduced to a sort of occasional, conference and discussion, where -nobody will be bound to anything, a sort of International Debating Society. You have swung, in the course of these debates, from one extreme to the other.Mr. AMERY : No. . Perhaps I have expressed myself unhappily.   I strongly hold and have always expounded the view that the League is weakened, and not
strengthened, by attempts to make it a rigid institution. It is as an International Debating Society, where people can meet across the table rather than write despatches to each other, where-they can meet collectively rather than discuss things two by two, that its greatest value arises..LORD BALFOUR: Are you not rather tco anxious to dot every &quot; i &quot; 1 I should have thought in a document like this you had better open as little front to attack as possible. This document will be unpopular in any case, and I would not make it more odious than I am afraid it will be by explaining that we want to modify the Covenant.   It. is a very serious proposition. &apos;Mr. AMERY : I wonder if we are clear enough, for instance, upon the question of Compulsory Arbitration.  Is it clear that we definitely do not accept the principle ?LORD BALFOUR : I cannot say upon that.Mr. AMERY : I do not want to be captious, but I am not sure whether a more clear statement of our objection would not be wiser in the long run.LORD BALFOUR : That is entirely for the Committee to decide.LORD CURZON : I understand the question you are raising now is as to the desirability of sending the draft at all?Mr. AMERY : No, I do accept the view that we should send a reasoned reply.LORD CURZON : Your criticisms began by being verbal, but they are ending by being fundamental.Mr. AMERY : I began first of all by drawing attention to the language of two points in the present draft, and then, apart from that, I expressed a doubt whether that is quite the best type of draft. I do not want to press that point too strongly if others are satisfied. But I have a certain amount of uncertainty about it, however admirably this may be phrased, whether it is definite enough.SIR SAMUEL HOARE : I should have thought that there was something to be said for, not sending this answer until we were a little clearer in our minds as to the other big questions security and the rest of them.LORD CURZON : I&apos; think Lord. Cecil has something to say.Mr. AMERY: Before that may I say that the last paragraph does imply a certain amount of policy, I mean in the sense of it, and implies something in the nature of a pact and therefore does raise the very question which cannot be settled without very considerable discussion.LORD CURZON: Will you speak now, Lord Cecil ?LORD CECIL: It is the last observation that I want to bring before the Committee, because I think it is very vital. Like everybody else I feel great admiral-tion for the draft as a draft. Nothing could be better, and I am sure Lord Balfour will not think that I am showing disrespect to him when I say that I am very doubtful about the policy underlying the sending of such a reply at all. The main difficulty I feel is the point put forward by Sir Samuel Hoare. I do not see how we can really be safe in sending any reasoned reply until we know what we are going to put forward ourselves as a positive policy. It seems to me, however you word your draft you.will hamper your future declaration. Lord Balfour said just now, and I respectfully agree with him, that this document will be very unpopular in Europe. T think so, too. It is evident that you are going to turn down what the forty-eight Powers agreed to, and certainly the French will be terribly distressed by a document of this kind.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I do not want to interrupt, but I do not agree. A good many nations will be immensely relieved if we do it. Sweden, for instance.LORD CECIL : Sweden wants to do nothing, and always has wanted to do nothing&apos;.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : In France they think it necessary to their position to sign a thing of this kind; but they do not think it will give them security.LORD CECIL : I think we can all make our own estimates, but I quite admit you are in a much better position to make an estimate than I am; but judging by the [12723] &apos; c 2
information, which reaches me, I do-not agree with:you... I think the rejection of the Protocol willbea profound disappointment to a very great number of nations in Europe. That is my impression. . I may be wrong; hut that is not so much the point;^ the thing;is that assuming it is going to be a disappointment;to some-- I do not think ;the Foreign: Secretary will deny that- . . . .. ;i   .Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBEELATN :&apos; T will give you Czechoslovakia and Poland at once.&apos;LORD-CECIL : And it will be a disappointment to a great number of people in France&apos;certainly. If you could at the same time put forward a definite proposal you would greatly diminish that disappointment. But if your proposition is &quot;We cannot put forward any proposal at present; we merely reject your proposal,&quot; then I think there will be a very great increase of disappointment.  That is my impression., LORE) BALFOUR : But that is not the draft.LORD CECIL : I am coming to that. I am quite ready to deal with it, but in sustaining a view which I recognise is not the view of everybod)^ here, my position is difficult. :f ;:&apos; Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Before you leave that part of your subject, what is &quot;the answer which 3^ou would make? Would you merely say that we have not finished our deliberations and we can sa)^ nothing?LORD CECIL : For the moment, that is what I should say. That is my impression-and the safest thing to do, on the whole. I do not say it is an ideal course, but the safest course you could- pursue. I quite agree, as Lord Balfour has reminded me, that this draft does not stop there, because it does suggest an alternative policy. Then you must see what that policy is. He has explained what he means by the phrase &quot;from the side unsuccessfully attempted in 1923.&quot; I say at once that was what I understood it to mean. His conception or at any rate this is what we understood is something in the nature of a pact which we have been discussing -this morning and as to which the Secretary of State for India and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have reserved their opinion. I think if you read the last paragraph but one on page 5 that is made quite clear. &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are not of opinion, that in the present state of the world any such tragedy lies immediately ahead, nor do they suppose that the chances of it are likely to increase. But, if the clanger should seriously threaten, they believe that the best way to meet it is not to stiffen the terms of the Covenant, but to provide special machinery for dealing with a special emergency&quot; that is a pact, evidently. &quot;Examples of such machinery are already: in existence&quot; Lord Balfour has explained that that refers to the.Little Entente, and that; is what I understood it to mean. I think he is a little wrong in the next paragraph, if you will forgive me for sajdng so. &quot; They consist essentially of defensive agreements, contracted under the aegis of the League.&quot; They are quite separate from the League  IS Sb matter of fact.LORD BALFOUR : Yes; if you are doing it under its aegis, you are separate.LORD CECIL: They have nothing to do with the League at all. They communicate with the League like every other country, but the Little Entente has nothing to do with the League so far as I know. Dr. Benes has often asked that it should be brought under the supervision of the League, &quot;by States which conceive themselves, for whatever reason, to be in a position of peculiar peril.&quot; All that indicates a pact, as I understand it. &quot; There is much to be said for schemes of this general type. Their close relation to the League &quot; I do not follow that &quot; should guarantee their purely defensive character.&quot; That is all assuming a pact. But is it really safe at this stage to indicate that our alternative policy is a pact, a pact which will certainly not be understood, unless Ave explain it, to include Germany, which will therefore mean a special pact with France and Belgium, and will be so understood to mean. Unless it is so understood I think the French will certainly be in a&apos;state of wild&apos;alarm as the result of this despatch. You will not satisfy the demand for European security. Therefore your only suggestion for dealing with European security are these phrases at the end, which seem, to me to indicate some-thing&quot; in the nature&apos; of a special pact. I should&apos;have thought that it would.be rash for us to suggest that at&apos; this stage. Further-Ave are to say&apos; that Ave are not in favour of anything like a general agreement. That is the first part of it. We doubt doubt the efficacy or possibility of enforcing: eA^en Article 16 of the League, to which a large part of the argument is directed. We. therefore, believe that the only thing to be done is something in the nature of special arrangements, which means: pacts.
I think that will create a very large amount of opposition, and present a policy- which would have to be explained if it was not to be very much misunderstood. If we are to explain it, what are we going to say in explanation? Are we going to say that we really do mean a pact with France and Belgium, or are we going to say, &quot; We cannot say what kind of pact it will be&quot;? We cannot do that. It would be an impossible position, I venture to suggest, to issue a document.of this kind, and then, when in Parliament you are asked what kind of pact have you in your mind, what kind of special arrangement you have in your mind, it would be certain that you would have to say one way or the other what special arrangements you had in your mind. Then you would have to say quite definitely that you did mean to include Germany or that you did not mean to include Germany. That is the great distinction between the two policies, as it seems to me-a vital distinction. If Germany is to come in, that is one policy; if Germany is to be kept out, that is another policy, and there is a vital distinction. Members of the House of Commons here may know better than I do. I do not think if would be possible, with a document of this kind, to avoid answering questions as to what, you really do mean. The moment you had to answer questions you would have to.take up a position one way or the other as to which kind of pact you meant. I think it would be very rash for us to do that until we know definitely what our policy is. I quite recognise the great difficulty in which the Foreign Secretary is. There are the Swedes, who no doubt are anxious to avoid any engagement; they have always been so, and they are anxious to reduce their army expenditure to the lowest point, and they want to avoid any further engagement. I think that is probably true of the Norwegians and the Danes, but I should not have thought that it was true of a good many of the other countries, and I should have thought, although I have no right to back my opinion against his, that his difficulties wrould not be made less but might be made greater if the. policy announced was that we were against any general agreement, that we doubted how far we could even enforce the provisions of the League as they stood; that we thought that nothing further can be done, certainly as long as the United States were outside the League, and that when we came to the pact the suggestion at the end, the last section, we were forced either to say we could not definitely say what we meant by it, or if&apos;we were in favour of a pact with Germany, as to which we had no ground at present for saying that such a pact was possible, or a pact with France and Belgium which would meet with very vehement opposition in this country and probably also in the Dominions. I venture to suggest, therefore, that although the difficulties of the other position are very great, still it would be worth while to delay for a few more weeks or months until we are in a position to say what these other alternatives are; what we do really mean to do. To put forward this kind of document will, just because of its clarity and brilliance, really add to our difficulties and not diminish them, and we shall gain far more than we lose by that delay if we are able to put forward a complete and not an incomplete policy. I feel very strongly this document will get us into serious difficulties both at home and abroad!LORD BIRKENHEAD : I cannot speak with your experience, but let us see. You take page 5, the paragraph beginning &quot;Let it then be supposed,&quot; then Lord Balfour goes on to consider the kinds of wars that may arise. Then he says :---&quot; It is not so admirable where a sudden attack has to be met by a quickdefence, where war is desired (by one of the combatants, at least) as the only means of satisfying ambition or accomplishing revenge.   Supposing that underthis strain it were to fail ? &quot;Now that is a case that has occurred, in other words, 1914. Then he goes oil to say : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are not of opinion that in the present state of the world any such tragedy lies immediately ahead, nor do they suppose that the chances of it are likely to increase. But, if the danger should seriously threaten ....&quot;.&quot;Danger.&quot; what danger? The 1914 danger. You see, then, all this talk afterwards0 is somebody might do something if that 1914 situation, which we do not in the lease anticipate,, were to arise.   I think it is obvious: &apos;      7:&apos; ...LORD CECIL : I have riot, read it, in that. way. ; Do you. really - think that document will be read as putting forward no alternative to the. protocol, except in a remote contingency which you do not think will arise?       - &apos;. ..
LORD BIRKENHEAD : I think that is what it comes to. LORD CECIL : I do not think that is what is meant. LORD BIRKENHEAD : In the presence of the author-LORD CECIL : It is not the author in this case that matters, but the reader, but if it were the case, is that really a very good alternative; is that what you would like, simply to tear up the Protocol without making any alternative suggestion at all ?   If that is the policy, I should have thought it was an equally dangerous policy.Mr. AMERY : As a reader, I do not think I should take the Secretary of State for India&apos;s view of the sentence,&quot; in view of the machinery already in existence,&quot; that seems to me an extension of the &quot; Little Entente&quot; machinery by a further pact.LORD BIRKENHEAD : Surely it means that there are parts of Europe Avhere the 1914 situation is apprehended ?LORD CECIL : The &quot;Little Entente&quot; by no means stands alone; there are other agreements.Mr. AMERY: What I am not clear about is, is this paragraph meant to convey that we shall have no part in these pacts, though we might bless their inception \LORD CURZON : I wonder if I may now say something about the present position. Two questions are raised. First the big question of principle as to whether we send out this draft, and if so, in what form ? Secondly, our own procedure both in relation to what passes between us and our Dominions, and the line we should take at this table with a view to the concurrence of our colleagues in the Cabinet. Upon the former point, I am, for reasons which I have stated before, in favour of sending a reasoned reply at the present moment. I need not recapitulate the reasons, because they have not only been stated by several speakers here, but they are endorsed by the Foreign Secretary, and if that be &quot;his view, as I take it to be, it carries great weight with me. If, however, we send a reasoned reply, might I make this suggestion to Lord Balfour ? His draft is a succinct and a very convincing statement of the case on certain, on perhaps the majority, of its aspects. But one or two it leaves out of notice altogether, and I suggest that it might be worth his while, if he is stating the whole case as it is to state it in its fulness, without necessarily adding much to its length. I will give you an illustration of what I mean. The main ground upon which the Protocol is regarded with suspicion by, at any rate, large sections of opinion in this country, notably the Liberal and Radical Party, is that it appears to stereotype indefinitely the existing territorial position in Europe, and that it contemplates marshalling in defence of that status quo the forces of the various States. &quot;Whether they take a military or an economic form. That is the ground which people, who are suspicious about the Treaty of Versailles, take most strongly, and if you read the expressions of public opinion, particularly of the character to which I allude, you will find that they concentrate almost exclusively upon that point, and to my mind it is one of the main objections to the Protocol. I thought it might be worth while that Lord Balfour, if disposed to do- so, should add something to his draft in that and other respects. When he spoke to us last time he told us that he had drawn up his draft without having read, or before there had been brought to his notice the report of Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s Committee.LORD BALFOUR: Yes.LORD CURZON : I have no doubt he has read it now. There are other aspects of the case, perhaps more particularly the military aspect, upon which great stress has been laid by our military and naval advisers, which are also ignored here, and I should have thought that the draft was capable of being strengthened not by us but by its author.LORD BALFOUR :  What arguments have you particularly in your mind lord CURZON : I have in mind the arguments as to the danger to our own country in particular, and the peace of the world in general, that would arise from the acceptance of the Protocol.LORD BALFOUR : I thought I had put that in.
LORD CURZON : You have put it in a sentence. I do not want to indicate now LORD BALFOUR: The stereotyping of Europe, was not that one of the points ?LORD CURZON: That is one you have not mentioned. LORD BALFOUR : That was your point ?LORD CURZON : That is my first point only. Then may I come to the concluding paragraph of Lord Balfour&apos;s draft? I must confess that here I have a good deal of sympathy with Lord CeciPs position, and I wonder in my own mind whether the rejection of the Protocol demands that at.this stage and in this draft, if accepted, we should state an alternative. The policy of the last paragraph is really one of regional agreements.Mr. AMERY : The whole last section really is that.LORD CURZON : Yes. The last section is one of regional agreements. Is that a policy which we are going deliberately to adopt ? From one point of view that paragraph seems to contemplate the kind of pact with France and Belgium, with or without the inclusion of Germany, which we have had in view. But it is much more than that, Lord Balfour tells us he has in mind something like the Little Entente. But if we imagine the way in which this will be read by the nations of the world, they will not know, when the announcement is made, what we are going to do in regard to France, Belgium and Germany in fact, we do not know ourselves- but this is a sort of hint to everybody, or at any rate to certain groups of States, that the policy the British Government favours is that they should make, separate arrange -ments among themselves,. Now such arrangements may be quite innocent, but they may also be very dangerous. The policy of the Little Entente is one which we are inclined ourselves to favour. But supposing you have Germany and Russia making a regional agreement; they might turn round and say : &quot; It is exactly what you told us to do. That is your way of solving the question. What right have you to object ? &quot; Is it therefore a wise thing to give an impetus to such a condition of affairs, and, useful as some of these smaller minor agreements may be, are you not really, if you adopt that as your policy, going straight back to the pre-war position which we have always denounced as the main cause of war ? Flow many times have we not said that the theory of the balance of power were fatal, and that they were the cause of the European conflagration ?Mr. AUSTEN CFIAMBERLAIN : I have never said that and I believe it to be profoundly untrue.LORD CURZON : A great many others did say it; and anyhow the view taken in many quarters has been that the League of Nations was going to take the place of these various alliances and so on which existed before. That, I believe, is the view taken by a great many of our own people. I am sure it is the view taken by the Dominions, and I gather from their telegrams that, supposing they are invited to agree to a draft and of course their assent will be required which lays down as the policy of the Empire that everybody is at liberty to make minor arrangements among themselves, and that in the last resort their oWn assistance and co-operation will be required in those arrangements in which they may appear to be involved, they would regard the situation with very great alarm. Then, again, if you deliberately lay down this policy of regional agreements, will you not have, very great opposition from the whole of your Liberal opponents; whom, as far as possible, we desire to get with us in the matter? That, if I remember right, was one of the main arguments for throwing over the Treaty of Mutual Assistance, and everything that has been said by Mr. Asquith or Mr. Ramsay MacDonald has, in my view, tended to throw doubt upon the position which it is now contemplated taking up. In my view, while sending the draft or something like the draft, it would be very well to pause before we commit ourselves\^s to the&apos; alternative suggestions at the end.Then as to procedure, if the Committee decided generally in favour of sending this draft or something like it, in order not indefinitely to prolong our proceedings, ought we not now to take it to the Cabinet ? Would it not be desirable, as the first step, that I should present a brief report of our proceedings here, send the draft with it to the Cabinet, discuss it there and seek their consent ? If that be given, the next following step must clearly be its communication by telegram to the Dominions.
I imagine that no one at this table would contemplate sending out the draft until that assent had been procured; and even if you do it by telegram, as you would have to do, some considerable time must elapse. They will make their observations; they will offer criticism; they may even make suggestions. That will be the second step. Now it is in the highest degree unlikely that either of these steps can be completed before Mr. Chamberlain goes to Geneva. I imagine he will have to consider seriously the possibility of having to tell the Council of the League that he is not in a position to make a statement on behalf of the British Government when the meeting takes place in March. Then we come to the further stages, and I confess I was rather horrified to hear from the Colonial Secretary that he thought a decision on the question of the pact could not be arrived at until after an Imperial Conference, which cannot take place until next year.Mr. AMERY : I think it is unlikely we can get an Autumn Conference.LORD CURZON : The whole argument of the Foreign Secretary is that the matter cannot be postponed, and all the more if we turn down the Protocol, as we contemplate doing, must the British Government arrive at a decision as to what its alternative policy will be during the course of the summer. Does it not come to this ? That the first stage of our further proceedings will be sending out this despatch, if it is accepted by the Dominions. The second stage will be to arrive at some conclusion among ourselves as to what the pact ought to be, if any pact is to be concluded, and having done that -and it may be a very difficult task then to take the same steps with the Dominions as we now propose to take in respect of our answer about the Protocol. Of course, if the Dominions then say that they cannot possibly give their assent without coming here to discuss it, a new situation arises; but I should be very reluctant indeed to accept the proposition that the whole of this question must be hung up until the Dominions can come and sit at a table in London next year. My proposal therefore is this, That we decide to-day whether we proceed upon this draft; that Lord Balfour should consider whether it is worth while adding to his own draft in his own language one or two considerations which he has left out. Thirdly, that we should discuss here, or, perhaps, preferably at the Cabinet, whether the concluding paragraphs suggesting the alternative regional agreement policy, should be included or not. Fourthly, when the Cabinet has decided as to the form, that the telegram should be sent to the Dominions. Fifthly, that we should then take up the question of security and a pact, and having made up our own minds as to that, we should reconsider the question in what form we are to communicate with the Dominions about it.Mr. AMERY : One point on procedure which I think it is worth while to call the attention of the Committee to, that is this. I think if the purely critical and negative part of Lord Balfour&apos;s draft, the first four paragraphs, were sent to the Dominions, it might not be impossible to get their assent with a few suggestions, fairly rapidly; but I am sure if section 5 is included that we shall not get any kind of agreement on the part of the Dominions, certainly not without discussion across the table.LORD CURZON : Do you mean the whole of 5 ?Mr. AMERY : The whole of 5 leads up to a pact policy. I do not think I can state too strongly my conviction that no form of correspondence could possibly lead to any sort of agreement upon the policy of a pact. It is only by getting them together, by getting the Foreign Secretary to state the strength of the European situation in his own words and with his personal conviction that there is the slightest chance- I would not even then put the chance too high of getting them to come into line on this matter. We have to face the fact that there are many&quot; things that we as an empire can no longer do with ease; that we can no longer make agreements com-mitting ourselves very deeply or for a length of time with rapidity and trust to our own Parliament to endorse it. We have something more difficult than the American Senate to contend with, we have a group of independent nations, and it is only by getting them round the table that we can deal with our problems. I would adopt Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestion, that the first four sections be somewhat amplified, and bring in things not touched on and some that are very loosely touched on.. In Section 2 compulsory arbitration is referred to very allusively.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN: If members of the Committee have any doubt about the extreme difficulty of conducting foreign policy when, in fact, you have no foreign
I imagine that no one at this table would contemplate sending out the draft until that assent had been procured; and even if you do it by telegram, as you would have to do, some considerable time must elapse. They will make their observations; they will offer criticism; they may even make suggestions. That will be the second step. Now it is in the highest degree unlikely that either of these steps can be completed before Mr. Chamberlain goes to Geneva.

Does it not come to this? That the first stage of our further proceedings will be sending out this despatch, if it is accepted by the Dominions. The second stage will be to arrive at some conclusion among ourselves as to what the pact ought to be, if any pact is to be concluded, and having done that -and it may be a very difficult task then to take the same steps with the Dominions as we now propose to take in respect of our answer about the Protocol.

I do not think I can state too strongly my conviction that no form of correspondence could possibly lead to any sort of agreement upon the policy of a pact. It is only by getting them together, by getting the Foreign Secretary to state the strength of the European situation in his own words and with his personal conviction that there is the slightest chance- I would not even then put the chance too high of getting them to come into line on this matter.

I would adopt Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestion, that the first four sections be somewhat amplified, and bring in things not touched on and some that are very loosely touched on., In Section 2 compulsory arbitration is referred to very allusively.Mr. CLIAMBERLAIN : If members of the Committee have any doubt about the extreme difficulty of conducting foreign policy when, in fact, you have no foreign
policy., or of the dangers, which await us and Europe if we do not come to early decisions, I would beg.them to hear my Chief of Staff, Sir Eyre Crowe, who has not only studied but he has handled foreign affairs for forty years&apos;. He will speak with an experience which gives him more authority than 1 have in thy, officialposition,&quot; , &apos;     - &apos;&apos;       &apos; &apos;r&apos;v-&apos;       &apos; &apos;;^&apos;yLORD CURZON: I have been urging expedition, as you know. Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN - If that is so, it is all right.LORD CECIL : I most heartedly agree with that. My view is that it is essential. I do not think a policy of mere negation is the policy in this case. If you are going to ensure peace and allay the uncertainty of Europe it is no use merely saying, we won&apos;t have your plan. You must be prepared to put forward some alternative plan.Mr. CHURCHILL : You can have a demeanour, an attitude, a course of action, which does not necessarily oblige you to put forward a cut-and-dried plan, but which has a certain tendency.LORD CECIL: That is what I should have thought the Foreign Secretary meant by having a policy which was not a policy. You must know what you mean. That is the first essential. The essential condition of a policy is to know what you really are going to try to do. We have begun the other way round. Personally, I would have said, what is it we really want to do ? How are we really going to meet this question of security ? How are we going to meet this question of disarmament ? What is to be our positive policy? That is what I always wanted to do, and, when you have got that, then, it seems to me, comes the time to frame the way in which you put forward this policy. This seems to me, with the greatest respect, putting the cart before the horse. You are going first to draft your reply and then you are going to settle your policy.  That seems to me to be insane.Mr, AMERY : Isn&apos;t it fair to the European Powers to let them know: that whatever our future policy is, we won&apos;t accept the protocol ? Isn&apos;t it fair to let them know that ?LORD CECIL : Isn&apos;t it a rash thing to say. The Hankey Committee suggested an amendment of the protocol. I certainly would like to put forward a possible amendment which I think would meet a good many of the objections that have been put forward.LORD BIRKENHEAD : That is the whole difference. You are fundamentally in favour of the Protocol. It repels me. I hate and detest it. Isn&apos;t that the difference.LORD CECIL : Fundamentally I am in favour of doing something which will render disarmament possible, and I am convinced that it can only be done by getting security. That is my point. I do not say that I am in favour of the protocol. A good deal of it I dislike, but I am in favour of the general policy that you have got to get security, and general security, because I go even further than the Chief of Staff. I think that England cannot be defended within 150 miles from the Channel. To preserve the peace of Europe is the only way of defending it.LORD CURZON:   Sir Maurice Hankey would like to say something, as Chairman of the Committee.SIR MAURICE HANKEY : By our Terms.of Reference we were instructed, to see how far the Geneva Protocol was susceptible to amendment. We drew up the best alternative we could. Obviously we had to base ourselves on the Protocol. We found that a great deal of the Protocol was a repetition of the least desirable features of the Covenant, in which the &quot; i&apos;s&quot; were dotted and the &quot; t&apos;s &quot; crossed, and that so far as it contained new proposals, those were objectionable. In these circumstances, we had to put forward the best plan we could. I do not think that we ever suggested that our amendments to the Protocol should stand by themselves as a substitute to that instrument. We included with them Sir Eyre Crowe&apos;s draft of the pact. It is not correct to say that our revised draft Protocol of amendments&apos; to the Covenant, was intended to stand alone as an alternative plan to the Geneva Protocol.   Our Report must be considered as-a whole.&quot;     &apos; [12723]: d
LORD CECIL : I think in the body of your draft you do say quite definitely that you think it would be objectionable to destroy the Protocol and that it would be better to proceed by way of amendment.&apos;;LORD CURZON: Will Lord Balfour help with his advice on the position as it now stands ?LORD BALFOUR :  I am rather surprised to find myself in the unexpected position of not having suggested a scheme.   It came from Lord cecils criticisms. 1 have not suggested a definite policy while he apparently thinks he is in the position of having suggested a definite policy.   I am sure I do not know what that policy is. He says he does not like the Protocol, but thinks the Protocol may be amended. Well, we have had some time.   Has anybody suggested an amended Protocol?   I should have thought those who think the Protocol could be amended would have given us their amendments.    I have not seen a suggestion in writing from anybody who thinks   that.     I   honestly  do   not  know  what   Lord   Cecil&apos;s   policy  is.   He says you must give security and, as I understand it, you must give security by   a   general   agreement.     How   is   a   general   agreement,   by   which   I suppose  you  mean an  agreement  embracing  all  the  nations  of  the  world that  are  in  the  League,   how  is  a  general  agreement  going  to  help  you to do that unless it is by stiffening up the Covenant ?   Well, I am very vehemently opposed to stiffening up the Covenant.    I do not know whether Lord Cecil is in favour of stiffening up the Covenant.   If so, I should be glad to know what form of stiffening up he proposes.   I am against it personally on broad practical grounds,. knowing too much of the defects of the Covenant, and to embark upon the most embarrassing task of amending the Covenant, I should like to avoid that as largely as possible.   Discussing documents is always a most unprofitable method of doing business and the most sure way of dividing people who ought to be friends.    I should be against that, but at all events my own view is quite clear.   I admit that when I wrote this document I was not in possession of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s passionate view, passionate view, that you cannot conduct the policy of this country unless you at once give France some feeling of security.   If anybody reads the last unamended paragraph, they will see that my own personal policy, what I should have liked to have seen, had it been possible, carried out, is that we should publicly say, if there is really a danger we are prepared to meet it in this way as the need arises. It seems to me the only way we can meet it.   I am one of those who hope and do more than hope, hope with a certain confidence that the hope will be fulfilled, that if we only in Europe managed our affairs without doing our best to irritate everybody all round in England we do not do it if the world went on that plan, there is not going to be a repetition of the Great War.    I have quite clearly indicated that in the Protocol and in my draft, and I do not think it is good policy to do what the French always do, that is, to assume that there must be a Great War amd then to set to work to deal with the situation from the point of view of their General Staff.   I think that is absolute lunacy.   One of our difficulties in our foreign policy at this moment is that we have to deal with the United States, and it is very hard to know how to deal with it, but I am personally convinced that it is unnecessary, and though I do not agree with the Colonial Secretary that the League of Nations should ever regard itself as a mere debating Assembly, I do believe that these perpetual discussions as to the military aspect of the League do nothing but harm. That is the pathological side.    The healthy side of the League is smoothing differences, carrying out financial and other arrangements, which it is doing admirably and which is bringing everybody together.   I heard a very interesting observation on that very point from Sir Llewellyn Smith before we met.    I do not know that the other case need come and, therefore, I should have liked merely to say to those who tell you that the League is not an adequate defence against, let us say, an aggressive Germany as at present constituted, I should have liked to have contented myself by saying, &quot;Well, I agree it is not an adequate defence. The general arrangements of the League are quite sufficient for dealing with ordinary quarrels; they are absolutely insufficient, in my opinion, for dealing with a Germany determined upon a war of revenge at the first opportunity.   The only way to meet that is by a regional decree.   I really do not care to look at any general arrangement unless the person who brings forward the general arrangement says: &quot; This is the way we shall deal with Germany if Germany suddenly decleares war, when her population has reached a proper limit, when she finds it convenient! &quot;  Will your scheme deal with that ?   If it does not, do not trouble me about it.   Nobody is going
to disarm for a general agreement which does not protect them against the old danger of which they are afraid. That is the idea tinder which I have tried to draw up my draft. I quite admit I have left out some points. I quite admit that I have deliberately avoided pressing such questions as the changes in the Covenant to which I am personally opposed, not because I think the Covenant is good, but because I think it is the best we can get for the present. I do hope you will see that the general Scheme which I have brought forward will do what no suggestion of Lord CeciTs has yet shown could be obtained in any other way,-it will give you some scheme by which you can say to the practical man : &quot; Very well, now, the danger the French are afraid of is an attack by Germany, but that danger is not at present a danger; it is a danger in the remote future. That is the danger that you talk of. I suggest that as soon as that danger appears above the horizon it should be our -recognised policy to have a regional agreement. This is what I should have liked, but the discussion we have had round this table has convinced me that the Foreign Secretary not only does not agree with that, but that he is passionately opposed to it. He feels he cannot conduct the affairs of this country while the French are in their present psychological mood, and that the only possible way of extracting this very terrible obsession, which really ought to be done by this new medical method. As you cannot do that I suppose you must bear with these impossible people, and I am, though reluctantly, quite prepared to support the Foreign Secretary, who, I think, is in a very difficult position, and if I may say so, not being a member of the Cabinet, ought to be supported in these circumstances. Of course, we can quote against them -I think this is absolutely true- the. statement made by Poincare. Poincare in one of his moods did not want an agreement. He said : &quot; What is the use of an agreement; England must come in if we are attacked.&quot; I forget on what occasion that speech was made, but I am sure I have not misquoted the substance of it. I think it is true. We should have been quite prepared publicly to indicate to the world that that was a danger which could be met and must be met in that way, but at the same time, I see the reluctance---Mb. CHURCHILL : Might not be met.   We might get defeated.   We haven&apos;t got the Russians now as we had before the war.LORD BALFOUR: That is the best you can do. Speaking for myself, I dislike these perpetual contemplations of an inevitable Armageddon No. 2. I think it is really doing harm to everybody, and that is why I approach in a very qualified and reluctant fashion the last paragraph of my despatch. I quite agree with Lord Curzon and with those others who have spoken, that you could put your objections to the Protocol in a much more brutal fashion. We object to the Protocol because we cannot stand compulsory arbitration, and we object to the Protocol because-LORD CURZON : That was not my point.   I wanted the answer to be not more brutal but more complete, and only, I think, in two respects which I indicated.LORD BALFOUR : I do not take a strong view on that.LORD CECIL.: I would like to remove a misapprehension from Lord Balfour&apos;s mind. I quite agree with you. I do not think you are ever going to protect the world from a renewal of the German war, by a general agreement, at any rate, in the near future. That is not my point. My point is that you have got to have these special agreements, but they should be within a general ambit, so as to avoid the danger of breaking up into groups. That is the danger that oppresses me, and that is why the Foreign Secretary remembers I was quite prepared to agree broadly on the policy of a German-Franco-British pact, if possible fitted into some more or less skeleton general scheme connected with the League, and having some bearing on disarmament. That was the broad line of it and I understood he agreed with me.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : May I add a single sentence? I am told in the Foreign Office that the first sign of that new movement in France which led to the adoption of the Dawes Report was Mr. Ramsay MacDonald putting in writing to the French Government that we were concerned with their security.   I need not saymore. .. -
LORD CURZON : I hope I may take it as an instruction from the Committee that I am now to report our discussions to the Cabinet. .Conclusion. The Committee agreed         .&apos;    ;That the chairman should send a Report to the Cabinet summarising the results of the enquiry by the Committee of Imperial Defence; transmitting such of the documents as he may deem advisable; and formulating for the Cabinet the issues requiring decision. &apos;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, February 20, 1925. -
A SUCCESSFUL British foreign policy depends, first, on a clear appreciation of the facts of the situation with which we have to deal, and, secondly, on an equally clear conception of British interests and of their relation to the facts.I have, therefore, set myself to work to examine the European situation from this point of view and to deduce from this examination the principles which should guide the foreign policy of the.Empire in the European sphere.Mr. Harold  Nicolson&apos;s  memorandum, prepared by my directions under the supervision of Sir Eyre Crowe, gives the result.   It presents clearly and succinctly both the basis and outline of the policy which I urgently recommend.   But it is much more than my individual opinion. In order to be certain that all points of view were adequately considered,&apos; I took the unusual course of holding a conference of all the senior officers of the Department.   This paper was prepared after and as a result of that discussion.   I do not pretend that everyone concerned would give exactly the same value to each of the facts set forth or each argument deduced from them, but I am entitled to say that it represents not only the personal opinion of the Secretary of State, but the considered view of the Foreign Office as a whole and of the very able and experienced body of officials who advise me.I commend it to the most careful consideration of my colleagues. No Minister can conduct foreign affairs successfully without a policy. It is my duty to suggest one, and it is urgently necessary that I should know whether what I propose is approved by the competent authorities.A. C.February 19, 1925.[12729m]
