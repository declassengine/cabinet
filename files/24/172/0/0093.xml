COPY No. Ofc) 77-&apos;        -   - ; &quot;    ......RATING AND VALUATION BILL. MEMORANDUM BY THE.MINISTER ^Op HEALTH.I circulate herewith a. draft of the Rating and Valuation Jj,&quot; Bill.     I realise that a Bill of this size and complexity will require some time for its proper consideration and acoo.rJdAngly I do not ask : the Home Affairs Committee to approve its final form at this stage, v But I am most anxious to give notice of introduction of tho Bill on Wednesday the Sth instant, and to- introduoe it formally on-Thursday the 9th, in which case the Bill can be read a seoond time soon after Easter but need not be circulated to the House until after the Recess.I therefore invite the Committee to give their approval now to the general principles of the Bill, postponing until their next meeting, which X hope can be held before Parliament reassembles, consideration of its details.Part I of the Bill deals with the reform of the rating system.     These provisions will, I hope, command general support, particularly from the larger local authorities who have in many cases secured similar reforms by means of Private Sill legislation.Amongst other things it Is proposed to abolish parochial rating and thereby reduce the number of rating authorities from over 15,000 to under 2,000.The Clauses in Part II dealing with Valuation Areas and Authorities will be controversial, and we know will be bitterly opposed by the Poor Law Authorities.     The proposal for a single valuation for rating and income tax purposes will Immediately simplify the procedure of the assessment authorities and will intro-duce uniformity of practice in place of the varying methods now prevailing.     Without such uniformity it is impossible to formulate any practicable schemes for the settlement of the vexed question of the
relations between national and local taxation, but there is likely to be some opposition from those who fear that the proposals will give undue power to the Inland Revenue Authorities.This part of the Bill also includes two important mattersnamely, -(1) Rating of Machinery, and(2) Valuation of Railways,The proposals in regard to the Rating of Maohinery are based, with certain important modifications, upon the recent report of the Inter-Departmental Committee.     I propose to receive deputa-tions from representatives of the machinery users on the one hand and the local authorities on the other, and if it should appear that the draft proposals are not likely to receive sufficient support, I should be prepared, when the Bill reaches the Committee stage, either to amend them or to delete them from the Bill altogether.The Clauses relating to Valuation of Railways represent in effect an agreement reached between representatives of the Govem-ment Departments concerned, of the Railway Companies, and of the local authorities, and should, therefore, be mainly non-controversial. It is of the utmost importance that these railway clauses should be passed into law this year.(Incd. ), N. C *Ministry of Health, April 2nd, 1925.

(1) In the case of hereditaments to which this A.D. 1025. section applies, that is to say, hereditaments the rents of       T which are collected at intervals shorter than quarterly, ^teseebtl0n ol the  rating  authority  may  require the owner of the owners&apos;. 5 hereditaments to collect, together with the rents thereof, the rates due from the occupiers thereof, and any owner who is so required shall from time to time collect the rates accordingly and pay over the amount collected within such period as may be specified by the rating10 authority in the requirement, or, if no period is so specified, before the expiration of the period in respect of which the rate is made.The rating authority shall allow to an owner who collects rates in pursuance of this subsection and pays15 over the amount collected within the time thereby allowed a commission equal to live per cent, of the amount so paid over.(2) In any case where the owner of hereditaments to which this section applies is not required to collect in20 accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section the rates due from the occupiers thereof, he may by agreement Avith the rating authority undertake to pay to them the rates due in respect of all such hereditaments in the area of the authority of which he is the owner,25 whether those hereditaments are occupied or not, and the authority may agree to make to any owner who so undertakes and pays over to the authority within the period specified in the agreement the total amount payable by him thereunder an allowance not exceeding30 fifteen per cent, of that total amount.(3) A requirement made or an agreement entered into under this section shall continue in force until cleter-mined by notice given, in the cause of a requirement, by the rating authority to the owner or to the person collecting35 the rates on behalf of the Owner, and in the case of an agreement, either by the rating authority to the owner or by the owner to the rating authority.A notice for the purposes of this subsection shall take effect only on the expiration of a period in respect of40 which a rate is made and must be given before the com-mencement of the period on the expiration of which it is to take effect.(4) Every owner who is by virtue of this section&apos; under an obligation to collect the rates in respect of any
A.D. 1925. hereditaments shall include in every demand for rent made on the occupier of any of those hereditaments an additional amount representing such proportion of the current rate as corresponds with the period in respect of which rent is demanded, and shall at the end of each 5 quarter or half-year so adjust the demand in respect of rates as to make it agree with the full amount due on account of rates in respect of the hereditament for the quarter or half-year.Where a demand for any amount on account of rates 10 is duly made by the owner in accordance with the pro-visions of this subsection, that amount shall be recover-able by him from the occupier as if it were rent, but such a demand if made otherwise than in accordance with the said provisions shall be of no effect. 15(5) Where in pursuance of this sectio n the rates charged in respect of any hereditaments are collected by the owner, the amount due from him in respect of those rates shall be recoverable by the rating authority from him, or where the rates are collected on his behalf by an 20 agent, from that agent, and in the same manner and subject to the same conditions in and subject to which, rates are recoverable from the occupiers of the rated hereditaments.The amount so recoverable shall be the full amount 25 of the rates due in respect of the said hereditaments after deducting therefrom such an amount as the owner is entitled to receive under the provisions of this section in respect of commission or allowance :Provided that where the owner shows to the satisfac- 30 tion of the rating authority that he has been unable to collect the full amount due by way of rent and rates in respect  of  the  said hereditaments for the period in question, the amount actually collected by him shall be  . allocated to rent and rates in proportion to the amounts 35 due on account of rents and rates respectively, and the amount allocated to rates shall be treated as being the amount recoverable under this subsection.(6) In the event of a change in the ownership of any hereditaments to which this section applies, any require- 40 ment or agreement in force at the date of the change shall continue to be binding on the new owner as if it had been made on or with him.
(7) The provisions of this section shall have effect in AD. 1925. substitution for any provisions contained in any local Act      &quot;  or provisional order with respect to the rating of owners instead of occupiers.5        11.
