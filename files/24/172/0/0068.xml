fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.CP CABINET. fl[C 3921/459/18][Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.]MEMORANDUM OF A CONVERSATION  WITH M. HERRIOT.IN pursuance of the promise which I made on my way to Geneva, I called upon the President of the Council this afternoon. He&apos; told me that he had been thinking seriously over our conversations, and had informed the Council of Ministers of what had passed between us. The points which seemed to him, after further consideration, to merit particular attention were those which he had already indicated: the absence of any reference to the Belgian frontier or to the southern frontier; the necessity for France to act loyally towards Poland and not to purchase her own security at the expense of Polish safety; the position of Holland in relation to this question, and the refusal of Germany to ratify a treaty of arbitration with Switzerland. All these required careful examination, but the points of greatest and most immediate importance from the French point of view were that Germany should enter the League of Nations, and that we should proceed, by the method which he had indicated of consultation and agreement between the Allies before we entered into negotiations with Germany.M. Herriot said that the rejection of the protocol and the simultaneous rejection of any idea of a separate pact with France and Belgium had come as a great shock to his colleagues and to the French public as well as to himself; that public opinion was very difficult to deal with, and that even among his colleagues he had difficulties to overcome. He did not know whether it would be possible, out of such proposals as I had sketched, to arrive at an eventual success, but he had said to his colleagues and was prepared to maintain before the Chambers and before French opinion that it was the duty of France not to repel, without the most serious examination, the German propositions, and to study seriously the British suggestions with a view to seeing whether a guarantee for French security and for peace could not be obtained from them. He had already taken the first step; his instructions to M. de Fleuriau were already in London, and he had caused similar instructions to be sent to the other Allied capitals and a short note to be sent to Berlin to show the German Government that he was seriously examining the possibilities of their memorandum. The last matter which he had mentioned was perhaps only a matter of procedure, but it was extremely important in consequence of the very sensitive state of French opinion.I took up his points in turn; I told him the substance of what had passed between the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself, and that just at the moment of leaving for my interview with him I had received from M. Skrzynski a report of the speech which he had delivered at last night&apos;s Franco-Polish banquet.   I had only been able to glance at it in a great hurry, but I thought that it indicated that M. Skrzynski had been somewhat reassured by what I had said to him, and was not at all inclined to take up a non possumus attitude.   In my view, as in that of M. Benes, if peace was firmly established in the west, that fact by itself would be an additional guarantee for the Powers of Eastern Europe.   I had no desire, in con-sidering the possibility of new agreements, to weaken the force of old treaties, but the covenant itself contained an article 19, to which, at the proper time, Germany might appeal if meanwhile she had been unable to come to any amicable arrange-ment direct with Poland, a contingency which, as M. Briand had indicated to me, was by no means impossible.   As to the southern frontiers, I assumed that what he really had in mind was that nothing should be done to weaken the provisions of the2737-6   [12869]
Treaty of Versailles; which forbade the union of Austria and Germany. He assented to this interpretation of his meaning, and I then asked him whether he had had any indication of Italian opinion, because I had heard from Rome that the Italian Government agreed generally with the views which I had expressed; M. Herriot replied that he also had received the same message or, rather, that he also had heard from the Italian Government that they agreed with him. I said that to my message they had added, however, something of greater interest, namely, that they would have very much disliked a Franco-Anglo-Belgian pact, to which they would not have wished to adhere and from which, they would have disliked to be excluded. M. Herriot said that that part of the message had not been delivered to him. I added that we ought certainly not to do anything that cast any doubt upon the pro-vision of the Treaty of Versailles forbidding the union of Germany and Austria. As to Belgium, I told M. Herriot that there would appear to be no difficulty, for M. Hymans had informed me that he had already been assured by the German Government that the omission to mention the Belgian frontier was due to an accident of draughtsmanship. About Holland, in regard to which M. Flerriot had said he felt some anxiety, for he could not exactly ascertain what was happening there, I said I could add nothing to the account I had given him of my conversation with the Dutch Miinister in London. As to the Swiss Treaty, he must be speaking under some entire misconception, for, after his mention of the subject at our last interview, I had enquired both in London and in Berlin, and I found that the treaty had been ratified three years ago. It was, indeed, as I understood, the provisions of this treaty and those of the German-Swedish Treaty of Arbitration that the German Government had in mind as a model, though not necessarily a model to be exactly copied, when they drew up their note.I now came to his two principal points, I was in complete agreement with him that the entry of Germany into the League of Nations was an essential though not a preliminary condition of any negotiations with Germany, on the lines which we had discussed. I did not wish to make it a condition preliminary to all discussions with the Germans, because just as I was anxious, wherever I could, to take account of his great difficulties with French opinion and to facilitate his difficult task, so I thought that We must also take some account of the difficulties of the German Government and ease their path where it was possible for us to do so. But I had already told Lord D&apos;Abernon that unless the Germans were prepared to enter the League of Nations on the same footing as other Powers, it would be idle to suppose that anything could come of their demarche. As to his second principal point  procedure I was happy to say I was equally in agreement with him. I did not mean that he on his side or I on mine might not ask a question of Berlin or make observation to the German Government before we were all agreed, but I thought it was indispensable that we should examine the possibilities of the German proposals, and reach some agreement among ourselves before we undertook to negotiate with Germany.By a train of thought which I failed to follow, M. Herriot had linked with this question of procedure the problem of disarmament. He had received a telegram from Washington that morning, indicating that it had been announced to the press by the White House the day before that, in view of the failure of the protocol, the President was considering the summoning of a new disarmament conference at Washington, and that the French Government: must be prepared to receive proposals for such a conference embracing all questions, both of military and naval defence. He must tell me confidentially, and using the freedom which he hoped I would permit, that such a proposal would be very unacceptable to the French. France was devoted to the League of Nations; but that America, which had induced her to enter it and had then withdrawn from it, which had refused her aspirations and offered her a guarantee treaty instead and then declined to ratify it; America, which was so aloof from all the suffering and the fears of France, and from all the dangers to which she was exposed; America, which touched sometimes with a rough hand the wounds which the war had left in the body and mind of France, and used the position of dependence in which France unfortunately found herself, to try and impose decisions and dictate policy; that this America, which refused to take part in the League deliberations, should summon her own conference in Washington. No ! such a thing at this moment, immediately after the rejection of the protocol and in the first disappointment of finding out that no purely mutual pact with England was possible, would be painful to French opinion and to himself pacifist though he was painful to the point of being humiliating.
M. Herriot had spoken with much emotion. I replied that I had, from the first, told Mr. Kellogg that I thought a conference in Washington on land armaments was an impossibility, but naval disarmament stood on a different footing, and that the British Government would be favourably disposed to any effort to carry further the work of the last Washington Conference in that field. We did not suppose that it was possible to lay down a proportion for cruisers in the same way as had been done to the battleships, but we thought that a limitation of the size of individual cruisers and questions of a similar character might be very usefully and fruitfully examined, and we should be.glad to join in the work if the other great naval Powers would do so. I had gathered from what he said to me in December that his great objection to a Washington Conference rested upon the supposition that it would extend to land armaments and I had so informed Mr. Kellogg. .1 hoped that he would not reject the idea of a naval conference. My Government had already approved a despatch for communication to our Ambassador in Washington instructing him to inform the Administration of our views. M. Herriot, who told me that he had difficulties even with his own Government and with military and naval officers, who did not always take the same views as civilians, said that tie was determined to propose the reduction of the period of service in France, and his Minister of War had agreed to bring the subject before the Chamber, but he repeated with great earnestness that it would be painful and again he said painful to the point of humiliation to be dragged to Washington, where they had felt, even at the last conference, that the atmosphere was not very friendly to them. If some kind of pact giving security to France resulted from the proposals which we had been discussing, then it might be an entirely different thing; then, indeed, he would go to his own French public and say that they must reduce their military strength. After all, France was now scarcely a naval Power, that question was of very little consequence compared with the much larger question of the land forces. What he wanted above all was delay. In reply, I said that I could understand his point of view, but I would beg him to see how different was our position. After all, the biggest factor in the world to-day was fear, and this fear was not confined to Europe, but affected other nations as well. The Americans were afraid of the Japanese; the Japanese were afraid of the Americans; if no further restrictions were agreed upon, they might very likely begin a new race in naval construction, and Great Britain, which had no desire to take such a course, would inevitably be compelled to follow in their wake. For us naval disarmament was, from every point of view, and particularly, perhaps, from the financial point of view, much more important than for France, and he would see, therefore, that it was not possible for me to adopt exactly his attitude. I would, however, reflect upon what he had said, and I would consult with my colleagues; I could make him no sort of promise, but instructions had not yet reached Washington or had not yet been acted upon, we would consider whether we could avoid taking any initiative. But if the American Government approached us, neither public opinion nor, I must add, our own opinions for I did not wish to put all the burden of any difference between him and me on that vague entity, public opinion would permit us to do otherwise than say that if other great naval Powers would co-operate, we should most gladly accept the American invitation.M. Herriot then reverted to the question of security. Was he right in understanding from my first conversation that the British Government had no idea of allowing it to be made a condition of a pact with Germany that the period of the occupation of the second and third zones should be shortened ? I said he was perfectly right in so understanding, and I repeated that I had indicated this to Lord D Abernon in my first communication upon the German memorandum as being a matter which could not be brought into question if negotiations resulted, and had received through Lord D&apos;Abernon Dr. Stresemann&apos;s assurances that no such condition formed any part of the German plan. This concluded our discussion on security, and I then&apos; enquired of M. Herriot whether he had any views about the publication of the report of the Inter-Allied Military Committee in Berlin, briefly indicating to him the reasons why I had been opposed to it, but saying that the Opposition parties in England demanded it, the German Government represented to me that it was unfair to withhold it from them, and that though I could perfectly well maintain my own position if he thought it inexpedient to publish the document, I could not resist a wish on his part to publish, which would be supported both by the Germans and by the Liberal and Labour Oppositions. He replied that his own Government were divided on the subject; some of them and General Walch were
oopposed to publication, as they said it would betray the source of their information and lead to reprisals against those who had supplied it, but he himself did not take that view. He thought that the German request was a fair one; that they were entitled to know what was alleged against them, and that the objection which he had mentioned might.be met by publishing the substance of the report whilst omitting the annexes and anything of.a nature to betray individuals to the vengeance of the German Government or of their neighbours. He was not yet in a position to answer my question definitely, because, as he had told me, his colleagues were not all agreed, But if they did come to some such conclusion, he suggested our soldiers might well get together to examine the report from that point of view, and to indicate what must be omitted in order to avoid that particular danger.March 16, 1925.
