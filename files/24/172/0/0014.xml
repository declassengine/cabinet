Memorandum &quot;by the Elnancial Secretary to the Treasury.I ask for authority to introduce a Charitable Trusts Bill of which a draft is attached.The Bill is quite non-oont rover si al. The objects of this Bill are, first, to facilitate the operations of the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds and, secondly, to alter the statutory dates for presentation by the Commissioners of their Annual Report to His Majesty and by the Official Trustees of their Annual Accounts to Parliament.I,       By Section 18 cf the Charitable Trusts Amendment Aot 1855, the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds, who are three In number, were given perpetual succession by the name I of &quot;The Official Trustees of Charitable Funds&quot; and wereempowered to hold by that name stock in the Public FundB and stock and shares of any Public Company,  securities and moneys. But they were not incorporated nor given a common seal, and consequently transfers ox stock must be executed by all three Official Trustees in person.At -the close of 1888, i-h which year Treasury Regulations for the conduct of the business of the Official Trustees, were issued, the nominal value of the securities held by the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds was  13,851,064.     Of these securities 131 varieties were transferable by deed.     Atj1
&apos;the close of 1924 the nominal value of the .securities held&quot;between 800 and 850 varieties were transferable by deed.     This development has caused a great increase in the number of deeds and documents requiring execution and signature by them.     Inthe Official Trustees must be productive of delay in dealing with investments and consequently of risk of loss.     The incorporation of the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds and the right to use a Common Seal as proposed in Section 1(1) of the Draft Bill would meet these difficulties.II.     The great increase in the number of transactions results in delay in obtaining details of transfers which have been made before the 51st December and renders it extremely difficult for the audit of the accounts of the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds to be completed before the end of February, during which month the Annual Report   of the Charity Commissioners should be presented to Hie Majesty.The difficulty will he met if, as is proposed in Section S of the Bill, the presentation of &quot;both the Report and of the Accounts is postponed to the month of March.amounted to more than  65,000,000.Of these securitiesthese circumstances the temporary absence of one or more of(Intd)W.G.Treaaury Chambers. 4th February 1925.
