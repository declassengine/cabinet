The history of Urals question is as fellows:-.In January, 1919,  the Admiralty appointed a Committee under the Presidency of Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram to review the scales of Naval Pay, the question of Officers&apos;
Pay being dealt with by a 85ub.-Coiraait.tee under Admiral Sir Lionel Ealsey.     The Report of this Sub-Co-ami t tee, which recommended considerable increases of pay, was,  subject to minor qualifications,, approved by the Board of Admiralty.     The War Office and the Air Ministry were at that time still  considering similar revisions of pay for their personnel.    The Cabinet, therefore, appointed a Committee consisting of representatives of the three Services and of the Treasury under the Chairmanship of Mr. H.A.L. Fisher, to co-ordinate the proposals of the Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry with regard to pay.4.      The War Office decided to introduce different rates of remuneration for single and married officers. They did so by giving married officers higher rates of lodging, fuel and light allowances.      The Admiralty and Air Ministry decided to pay single and married officers alike.      In 1921, however, a difference was introduced between married and single officers in the Air Force as regards fuel and light allowances.5.      The Committee had, therefore, to lay downsuitable scales of pay for officers of the three services which took this difference of system intoaccount,  i.e., the uniform scales of pay for naval officers had to be in due relation to the averagerates of pay yielded by the different scales for single and married officers adopted in the Army.6.     The Fisher Committee finally recommended scales of pay for naval officers practically equivalent tothose already proposed by the Admiralty, and their reports were signed by the Admiralty Representative.- 2 -
7*       It is clear, therefore, that the scales of pay laid down for naval officers by the Disher Committee were accepted at the time by the Admiralty as sufficient in themselves and as duly related to the emoluments of army officers.    We have, indeed, little doubt that, but for the introduction of differential married rates in the Array,  no agitation wo uld have arisen for the grant of increased remuneration to married naval officers.8,       It is contended by the Admiralty, however, that in fact the Fisher Committee (and their own representatives upon it) failed to discharge their duty of correlating remuneration in the three Services and gave an undue advantage to the Army.    It is also contended that the existing emoluments of naval officers are insufficient to enable them to provide adequately for their families,, 9.       The Admiralty accordingly propose the grant of married allowance to naval officers on the following scaleCom lissioned officers of and above 30 years of age, up to and including officers of captains rank (Lieutenants, Ehc-mate and Mates from 25 years)6/6 a dayCommissioned officers of and above )30 years of ago, up to and including )officers of captaihrs rank ) 4/4 a day(Lieutenants, Ex-mate and Mates from )25 years) when drawing unemployment )pay - - )Commissioned officers of Warrant )rank ) 4/- a dayWarrant officers from 25 years of age     3/6 a day the cost of this scheme is estimated to be  350,00 0 per annum.10.      The majority of the Committee, the Financial Secretaryto the Admiralty dissenting,  are of opinion that the caseof the Admiralty has not been established under either oftho two heads in paragraph 8 above.
11.    The representatives of the War Office and Air Ministry-would,  however, be prepared to assent to the grant of a marriage allowance of 3/- a day to Lieutenant-0ornma nders -and Commanders, with a proportionately lower rate for Warrant offic       4 etc.- at a cost of approximately  120,000 a year, provided that certain claims put forward Independently by   them for analogous improvements in the emoluments of Army and Air Force officers were also conceded.12.      The War Office desire to increase the existing scale of lodging allowances for both single and married officers at a cost of approximately  200,000 a year. 13.      The Air   Ministry desire to adopt the Army scales of Married Allowances (including the improvement now asked for by the War Office) at a cost of  69s000 a year. 14.      The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty is unable te modify the claim of his Department for the grant to naval officers up to the rank of Captain of&apos; Marriage Allowances at the rates set forth in paragraph   9 above. 15a      The Committee can, therefore, only report to the Cabinet that, in view of their Terms of Reference5  they are unable to make any recommendation on the subject of Marriage Allowances ts the Navy.      They have not enquired into the merits of the corresponding claims put forward by the War Office and the Air Ministry.12531s    The Financial Secretary, to the, Admiraltywishes his dissent from this, ReportrecordedaSigned on behalf of the CommitteeJOHN OILMOUR.
