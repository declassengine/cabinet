ts DOCUMENT IS. THE property OF HIS BUTAffNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GQVi^IfflM,)C.-P. 147 (25). CABIKJBT.DISINTERESTED MAHAGljfeNT OF LICENSED PREMISES. Memorandum by the Lara, Privy Seftl:*In the debate upon the Bishop of Oxford&apos;e Bill in the House of Lords last year it became apparent that though the Bill was found to be ill-drawn, unfair and unworkable!-, there were cany who, whilst they voted against it and defeated it, were.uneasy at an attitude of blank negation on Licencing Reform;    and when a week or so later.a motion was brought forward asking for an enquiry into the system of Disinterested Management, there was considerable feeling in favour of this enquiry and it was accepted by the then Goyernment though the terms of reference were never&apos; settled.     Before the discussion upon this question came on I consulted the leader of the Party as to the line which it would be proper for me to adopt as representing the Front Opposition Bench.     I was personally strongly in favour of the enquxry, but I could not speak in that sense officially as representing our friends upon my own responsibility. The leader thereupon authorised me to support the enquiry as representing my colleagues.      Consequently in urging the Government to accept the motion I said &quot;I am speaking not for myself alone bpt for my noble friends who have acted with me in the, past, and who sit upon this Benchnow.......we make. this, formal request to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, speaking, with a full sense of responsibility&quot;. No doubt in form those words, only, covered: the members of the Front Bench in the Lords, but there could be very little doubt as to what they implied.     I need only: add
Cl, q that I was careful to guard myself from expressing my opinion as to what the finding of such an enquiry would be and as to the practicability of any system of disinterested management.The Government as I have said accepted the motion but it proceeded no further.   Mow Lord Lamington asks whether we in our turn will set up the enquiry which we successfully urged upon our predecessors.Disinterested management has been proposed and to some extent tried in several different forms.   There is the famous Carlisle experiment.    Public House Trusts under which intoxicating liquor is sold without profit beyond the bare interest on the capital invested have been in existence for many years.    When the Scottish Temperance Aot was going through Parliament the late Lord Balfour of Burleigh proposed to Insert an elaborate system with the same object, and finally modified amendments in that direotion were inserted in the Bill by the Unionist Peers but were rejected in the Commons.    Lastly the Bishop of Oxford^ Bill contained among other provisions a plan for reorganising the Trade whioh was a form of disinterested management not I think of a satisfactory kind.    But the principle which is aimed at is always the same namely, that the element of direct pecuniary benefit should be. removed from the motives of those who sell intoxicating liquor. If any advance is to be made in Licencing &quot;Reform which shall nevertheless be fair to the trade and will preserve the legitimate rights of the public to reasonable refresh-ment it must probably go upon some such lines.    At any rate the system deserves enquiry.(Intd.)   S.March 10th, 1925.
