telegram No.87.TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of CANADA, the COMMONWEALTH of AUSTRALIA,  NEW ZEALAND,  the UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA and the Governor of NEWFOUNDLAND.(A copy of this was also sent by despatch to the Governor-General of the IRISH FREE STATS).(Sent 10 p,m. 25rd February.  1925.)Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister. Begins. British Ambassador at Washington recently reported that possibility of further Disarmament Conference had been considerably discussed in United States and that, In event of President issuing invitations to Conference limited to Naval Disarmament, there was little doubt that ho would be supported by practically unanimous opinion of covmtry. Sir Esme Howard expressed opinion that, provided circumstances In Europe and Japan not unfavourable,  it seemed almost certain that some such proposal would emanate from United States Government before end of present year.     Retiring United States Ambassador in course of farewell conversation with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs prior to his departure to take up post of Secretar;/ of State at Washington referred to question . of Disarmament, and, Mr. Kellogg and Mr, Chamberlain agreed in thinking that there was little or no prospect of continental Powers agreeing to Conference at Washington on question of Land armaments, but Mr.  Chamberlain thought better prospects might attend Conference similar to that of 1921-22 summoned to deal further with limitation of Naval armaments.     Matter has been considered by Cabinet and onv strong view is that, especially as prospect of Disarmament Conference under auspices of League of Nations in which United States would participate now seems remote, suggestion for further Conference-1-
Q &apos;Q ?at Washington On Naval Disarmament should be welcomed as step towards checking International competition in armaments and lessening risk of future wars.     Accordingly it is proposed to send to British Ambassador despatch of which following is summary begins.      In course of farewell con-versation between United States Ambassador and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs prospects of further disarmament and possibility of holding another Conference at Washington to continue and develop work of 1922 Conference were touched upon.     Unnecessary to mention how gladly British Government and other Governments of the Empire availed themselves of the opportunity of participating in that Conference or their hearty and immediate response to general scheme proposed by United States Secretary of State.     No Governments more readily accepted nor have any more loyally fulfilled obligations then subscribed by most important naval powers.     Decisions of Conference have done much to restrict growth of fresh Inter-national competition in naval armaments;    and to relieve burden of taxation which would otherwise have fallen to be borne by tax payers of respective countries.      British Ambassador is asked to repeat formally to United States Secretary of State assurance given in conversation to United States Ambassador that His. Majesty&apos;s Government would cordially welcome summoning of a new Conference to be held at Washington and would most readily join with the other great naval powers in further limiting naval armaments and expenditure.      It will be for convening Power to consider in what directions progress may be most readily achieved.     Obvious that there are geographical and other reasons for which ratio already agreed on for capital ships could not be applied to case of cruisers.     But His Majesty1s Government have no doubt that with co-operation of
the other Naval Powers further substantial progress could be made.      In particular and without excluding other matters it would seem to His Majesty?s Government that discussion on all or any of following points might well lead to an agreement which would sensibly relieve burdens on national finances and lessen danger of war -(1) Dimensions and armament of cruisers.(2) Armament of aircraft carriers.(3) Total number dimensions and armament of submarines.(4) Dimensions and armament of destroyerse   Ends.Before despatch Is sent we should be glad to know whether you concur in our general attitude and have any observations on terms of proposed communication. If the Conference takes place   we should attach much importance to arranging for British Empire Delegation, Including separate representation of Dominions, on lines1 adopted at Paris Peace Conference and at Washington in 1921.Similar telegram sent to other Prime Ministers.

Telegram from, the Governor-General of canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 7th March, 1925.7th March.Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Ministerxbegins:-     Your telegram 23rd February.      If there appears no likelihood of a conference for reduction of armaments under the League of Nations with United States participating and withoxit prior acceptance of Protocol and if there does appear likelihood that proposed Washington Naval Conference would lead to substantial results we should concur in general attitude of sympathy towards latter proposal expressed in draft despatch to British Ambassador at Washington.     We note with pleasure the statement as to the importance of arranging for separate representation of Dominions in British Empire Delegation.      In order to avoid difficulty which arose in 1921 from fact that the Dominions were not directly invited to attend the Conference of thatyear as to which protest was made by Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa in telegram to Prime Minister of Canada dated 19th October 1921 and reference made in report of Sir Robert Borden to Canadian Government on Conference paragraphll4 we consider it also very desirable that if Conference is held, separate invitations should be sent to several Governments of the Empire.

The lines suggested by you are generally acceptable and even welcome to us and provided the Empire is amply safeguarded by reservations with regardto the Agenda we concur s      Ends,,-5-
