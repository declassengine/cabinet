CONFIDENTIAL.[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.]133./16]/^X^ STRENGTH OF THE EGYPTIAN ARMY.16 1   M    \ * I__&apos;UJ^lQfafi oflproposed Despatch from Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Field-Marshal- Viscount Allenbij (Cairo). (No.      .) .My Lord, &apos; Foreign Office, March    , 1925.THE proposal to increase the strength of the Egyptian army by two battalions (your telegram No. 76 of the 18th February), read with the announcement that an Egyptian Army Council had been created (see your despatch No. 92 of the 8th February), would be disquieting indications were it not for the fact that they appear to be due to King Fuad&apos;s initiative and not to that of his present Ministers. It is indeed unlikely that any reasonable Egyptian Government would undeitake responsibility for this wholly unnecessary financial burden; but I do not wish to overlook the possibility that a future and less well-disposed Government may support the King in his wishes, and, should such a contingency arise, it would be well that your Lordship should leave the King and the Egyptian Government in no doubt as to the view^s entertained by His Majesty&apos;s Government on this subject.Any substantial increase of the present-strength of the Egyptian army would naturally lead His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider against whom that increase was directed. Obviously it could not be required to repel external aggression. Nor can it be supposed that it is required to deal with internal disorders. If internal disorders were to become so serious as, to make the Egyptian police and the present Egyptian army incapable of dealing with it, it would be because those forces were themselves not to be trusted, and increased numbers would only be an increased danger. In such a case the duty of restoring order would undoubtedly devolve on His Majesty&apos;s Government. The answer can therefore only be that any such increase is directed against a foreign Power, and the only Power which the Egyptian Government could have in view is England.Having reached this rather obvious conclusion, it should be made quite clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not in present circumstances consent to a further increase of the Egyptian army.The present strength of the Egyptian army is, I understand, approximately 17,500, and it has, I believe, stood at about that figure for a considerable number of years. I am wrell aware that since the Egyptian army was dissolved by Khedivial decree on the 19th September, 1882, and reorganised by Sir E. Wood,Jgradualadditions to its strength were made until about the year 1900.   Whenfirst reorganised the total force consisted of about 6,000 men; in 1891 it consisted of about 13,000 officers and men; in 1893 its numerical strength is given as 14,718, in 1894 as 15,863, and in 1895 as 16,663.It might therefore be argued that a gradual increase such as that which was considered necessary during the nineties could equally be justifiable now. Any argument of this kind should, I think, be resisted, since the conditions which called for an increase of the Egyptian army towards the end of last century no longer exist.It is very possible, that King Fuad viewTs an increase of the Egyptian army as1 a satisfaction to his personal vanity or as a support to his throne, and if these were the only purposes achieved by such an increase there would be no need to raise any great objection ; but it would not improbably be construed by Egyptian opinion as a Nationalist gesture, and, if followed by successive increases, it might easily lead to a highly inconvenient situation.In these circumstances it would, be well that your Lordship should explain to King Fuad and to his Government the opinions held by His Majesty&apos;s Government on this subject with great clearness if and when the subject is again raised, but not otherwise.I am, &amp;c.2717   [12773][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]
