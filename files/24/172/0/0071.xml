[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;! Government. 136 confidential.e.P. 171 (25).CABINET.IRAQ :  TURKISH PETROLEUM COMPANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.MY colleagues will recollect that the question of the grant of an oil concession in Iraq to the Turkish Petroleum Company was considered at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 25th February, and that it was decided to refer the matter to a Cabinet Committee under the chairmanship of the Lord President of the Council. The Committee, which met on the 27th February, recorded the following decisions: 1. The High Commissioner for Iraq should be informed that it was not intended to present anything in the nature of an ultimatum to the Iraq Government in order to overcome their objection (based upon their rights under the San Remo Convention) to the grant of a concession which would not specifically provide for Iraq share participation, nor to move King Faisal to dismiss the present Iraq Cabinet and replace it with one willing to sign the concession in its present form.2. Negotiations should be opened with the representatives of the Turkish Petroleum Company with the object of inducing, them to accept an arrangement whereby the share capital of the Company would be increased by 20 per cent, and the additional shares allotted to the Iraq Government, subject to certain conditions.Sir Henry Dobbs was informed by telegraph of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s decision, and was instructed not to take the initiative in bringing further pressure to bear upon the Iraq Government pending the outcome of the negotiations with the Company. A meeting between the President of the Board of Trade and myself and Mr. Nichols, the Managing Director of the Turkish Petroleum Company, took place on the morning of the 28th February, at which Mr. Nichols was definitely informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared either to press for the dismissal of the present Iraq Cabinet or to present an ultimatum to the Iraq Government. Two alternative proposals for the solution of the difficulty were put to Mr. Nichols.The first alternative was that the Iraq Government should be given, free of. cost, fully paid shares in the Turkish Petroleum Company amounting to 20 per cent, of the total issued share capital of the Company, such shares to be a special issue ranking for dividend pari passu with the ordinary shares of the Company, but not entitling the Iraq Government to intervene in the commercial policy or general management of the Company, and subject to the same restrictions with regard to transfer as were applicable to the ordinary shares. Any dividend payable on the shares held by the Iraq Government would count against the amount of royalty payable to that Company.The second alternative was that the Company should agree to accept a scheme on the lines of that suggested by the Iraq Prime Minister and reported in Sir Henry D6bbs&apos;s telegram No. 95 of the 17th February (vide CP. 108 (25) ), whereby the question of share participation would, failing agreement, be submitted to arbitration.   These proposals were subsequently confirmed by letter.On the 2nd March Sir Henry Dobbs telegraphed that Count Teleki, a member of the League of Nations Frontier Commission, at present in Iraq, had offered to use his good offices to persuade the Iraq Government to sign the Turkish Petroleum Convention. Sir Henry Dobbs attributed this offer to the Commis-sion&apos;s desire to induce both the Iraq and Turkish Governments to agree to grant[12870]
a concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company over the Mosul Vilayet, in order to ensure that any proposals whioh the Commission might have to make&apos;regarding the disposal of that area would not be opposed by powerful oil interests. There-fore, fearing lest the signature of the Convention by the Iraq Government might encourage the Commission to assign the Vilayet to Turkey, Sir Henry Dobbs recommended that a clause should be added to provide that the Convention should become null and void in the event of the Mosul Vilayet not being assigned to Iraq.On the 4th March a letter was received from the Turkish Petroleum Company stating that they were prepared to accept the first of the two alternative proposals put to them, provided that the Iraq Government were willing to sign a draft Convention which had been drawn up in February, and suggesting that the arrangement for Iraq share participation should be embodied in a separate agreement, for which they proposed a definite form of words. After consultation with the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office, telegrams were despatched to Sir Henry Dobbs on the 7th March communicating the terms of this separate agreement and instructing him to bring the utmost pressure to bear to induce the Iraq Government to accept the arrangement proposed without further delay. He was also informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government were unwilling to complicate . matters further by appending the additional clause to the Convention which he had suggested in his telegram of the 2nd March.Shortly after the despatch of this telegram a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs, dated the 7th March, was received, stating that the majority of the Iraq Council of Ministers had passed a formal resolution authorising the Minister of Communi-cations and Works to sign the Convention without insisting on the right of Iraq to participate in the share capital of the Company, subject to the settlement of certain minor points. He added that the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Education had tendered their resignations.Upon receipt of this telegram a further telegram was sent to the High Commissioner giving him discretion to suspend action upon the telegrams sent to him on the 7th March.On the 12th March Sir Henry Dobbs telegraphed that everything had been settled with the exception of one clause of the draft Convention which concerned the price of oil for local consumption and which gave the Iraq Government an option to acquire a local refinery in certain circumstances. This option had apparently been definitely conceded by the Company&apos;s representative in Iraq at the end of January, though the representative had acted without the authority of his Board, who subsequently disallowed his action. Sir Henry Dobbs apprehended that, unless the Company gave way on this point, the negotiations with the Iraq Government would definitely break down.The substance of this telegram was communicated orally to Mr. Skliros, of the Turkish Petroleum Company (in the absence of Mr. Nichols), who undertook to summon a further meeting of his Board and to do his utmost to persuade them to accept the Iraq Governments view. It is understood that he was successful and that the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s Iraq representative was authorised by telegram to concede the point at issue.A telegram has now been received from Sir Henry Dobbs reporting thai; the  Convention was finally signed by the Iraq Government on the 14th March.   I am  not yet aware of the precise terms of the Convention as signed, but I understand &quot;that it does not contain any provision for the participation of Iraq in the share capital of the Turkish Petroleum Company.L. S. AMERY.Colonial Office, March 18, 1925.
