feGRET.Lp.  125(25).CABINET-,ANNUAL REGISTER OB&apos; ELECTORS,Memorandum by the Home Secretary.As the Minister in charge of electoral matters,  I have studied the question of a single Annual Register of Electors and I am quite unable to support the proposal made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Note  (CP. 100/25) of the  18th February,, 1 adhere to the view at which the last Conservative Government arrived after a full consideration of the case as set out in Mr.  Bridgeman1s memorandum CP.10 (23)   (copy annexed);     and I do not think that the case for an Annual Register is in any way strengthened by the additional  considerations mentioned in the Minute of the Financial Secretary which has been circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.    That Minute suggests that the objections of the Labour and Liberal Parties would to some extent be countered if the qualifying period were shortened to three months.    This is not, however,  the case;    it has already been made clear at earlier discussions with representatives of the Central Party Offices that the hostility to the Annual Register proposal would not be diminished by this change. The advantages claimed for it in the Minute in question are illusory and are based in part upon a misapprehension of franchise law.    For an explanation of the position see Appendix A.    Put shortly,  the effect of the change in qualifying period coupled with the abolition of the Spring Register would be to benefit only a relatively negligible number of individuals as compared with the number who would be penalized,,    The size of that number may be gathered from the fact that the names added in forming the Spring Register 1924 numbered nearly a million and a half,  representing 8.5 per  cent.of the previous Autumn Register for England and Wales as a whole, while in particular constituencies the percentage was as high as 15.(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)
2.    The Minute states that the  saving would be increased&apos;by any material extension of the female franchise.    But,  given such extension,   it is evident that the case for a reversion to the more costly method of printing electors&apos;  lists would be greatly strengthened if there were only an Annual Register.    Moreover,  the extension of the franchise would aggravate the disadvantages of the Annual Register by reason of the increased difficulty of securing complete and accurate registration.    Again, while no General Elections have taken place during the spring and summer months since 1900,  it seems to me very midesirable that this precedent should be enforced upon Governments in the future by the absence of an up-to-date register during that period of the year.    Further,  it would be alleged that the Annual Register proposal is a party move for the disadvantage of Labour voters,  who on change of residence have greater difficulties than the voters of other parties in polling in their old constituencies.    It should not be overlooked that any impairment of the electoral machinery can only weaken the prestige of Parliamentary methods of government and strengthen the hands of those who advocate other methods.3.    In accordance with the pledges given by the Prime Minister at the last election1and by myself in the House of Commons on Friday last,  it is contemplated that a conference of all parties shall be convened next year,  on the lines of Lord Ullswater&apos;s conference,  to prepare a scheme in connexion with the extension of women&apos;s franchise;     and the above considerations,   coupled with the fact that the present half yearly Registration was inaugurated as part of the compromise agreed to at the former conference,  all seem to me to point clea,rly to the conclusion that the present system ought to be maintained until exact scope of the new conference,  which indeed might desire an opportunity of considering the matter,  is settled.V/.  J. H.28th February,   1925.
APPENDIX    A.The abolition of the Spring Register would affect two classes of voters -(i)    those who change their residence from non-contiguous areas or who become new occupiers during the period 16th December to 15th June;(ii)    those who. change their residence etc.,  from contiguous areas or who reach the franchise age during the period 16th June to 15th December.Under the present system,  all these get on to the SpringRegister of the following year.    Under the proposed system witha three months qualifying period,, half of those in class  (i)will get on to the Autumn Register of the same year and theother half will get on to the Autumn Register of the following year.    Half of class  (i) will therefore be better off thanthey would be under the present system and half will be worse off.But the people in class  (i) form only a verjr small proportion of the persons who will be affected.    The great majority (it is estimated over 90fa) of the changes fall under the heading (ii).    These will not be benefited by the reduction in the qualifying period at all.    Under the proposed system they will all have to wait till the Autumn Register of the following year.Again,  the illustrations in the Financial Secretary&apos;s Minute assume that to be qualified for registration an elector must be of full age throughout the qualifying period.    In fact,, however,  it is sufficient if he is of full age on the last day of the qualifying period.    The illustrations and the comparisons based upon them are thus incorrect.D12-14.
It is desired to obtain a decision of the Cabinet on the policy of introducing legislation to authorise the preparation of a single annual register of electors in place of the two half yearly registers.    Attached is a copy of a Bill for the purpose which has been prepared at the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who desires the change in view of the economy which it will effect.The matter has been referred to on various occasions during the life of the last Parliament.      On the 15th November 1920, the Prime Minister, then leader of the House, stated in reply to a Question that in view of the large saving likely to result the Government would be glad to see adopted the proposal for one register per annum instead of two and that &quot;if it commends itself generally to the House, they would be prepared to introduoe legislation accordingly as soon as possible.&quot;Subsequently 270 members of the last Parliament expressed themselves in favour of an annual register;    and on the 24th February, 1921, the then Minister of Health brought the subject before the Cabinet, who at a meeting of 4th March,  1921,  asked that the views of the Government Whips should be obtained.The late chief Unionist Whip and his suocessor thepresent Whip each reported in favour of the change, but the chief Liberal Whips stated that the proposal would meet with almost unanimous opposition from Coalition Liberals.      It was. understood also that the Independent Liberal and Labour Parties would strongly resist the ohange.A memorandum (C.P.  388l) dealing with the question was circulated to the Cabinet by the late Home Secretary on 23rd Maroh, 1922, but no decision was reached.During the passage of the Government Bill of last Session to extend the time for preparing the registers, amendments raising the question of an annual register were put down by several members but were ruled out of order.     Later in the Session the First Reading of a Bill, introduced by Mr. D. Herbert to restore an annual register, was only agreed to after a division by 200 to 112.      The Bill did&apos; not progress further.The main considerations to be borne in mind are these:-1. The system of two Registers a year which was introduced by the Representation of the People Act 1918 is generally regarded as an integral part of the compromise reached by the Speaker&apos;s Conference on whose recommendations the Act was based.     Previously one,register only in the year was prepared.(This document is the property of His Britannic iviajestyrs Government).CABINET.SECRET.O.P. 10 (23). THE AMMUAL REGISTER PROPOSAL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.
0 02. All General Elections within the last 15 years have taken plaoe during the period of the six winter months covered by the present Autumn Register, and all ordinary elections of looal authorities take plaoe during the same period.      The Autumn Register is therefore more important than the Spring Register.      But many Bye-elections of course take plaoe on the latter;    and the political atmosphere of the second quarter of 1922 hardly justified muoh oonfidenoe in the view that a General Eleotion will never be held during the currency of the Spring Register.3. The substitution of one Register for two would defer the inclusion in the Register for a constituency,  of electors who have removed to the constituency and of persons newly qualified.      In the event of an eleotion during the present Spring Register period the former could vote in their old constituencies only, and the latter could not vote at all,      The extent to which this consideration would operate is indicated by the fact that the new names included in any half yearly register are on the average 5 to 514% of the total electorate, the proportion varying substantially in different   areas;    e.g. in Islington the new names are over 10,000 on a total electorate of 155,000.4. The change would effect a saving of approximately  250,000 per annum, half of which accrues to the Exchequer and half to local rates. The total yearly cost of the two registers is now about  992^000 ( 640,000 for compilation and  352,000 for printing). ,   The economy may be reduced below  200,000, if, as appears probable, the change necessitates a reversion to the earlier and more expensive method of publishing the electors lists:* while there is some risk of higher printing charges being incurred in consequence of the work becoming more seasonal.While the Bill submitted has been, prepared, at the request ofrthe Chancellor of the exchequer, to embody the single annual register proposal, mention might perhaps be made of another proposal which has been under examination and which, though productive of considerable economy, would involve a less drastia curtailment of franohise rights.     A complete register to remain in force for one year would be prepared in respect of the Autumn qualifying period.      The qualification in respect of the Spring Register qualifying period would remain, but there would be no canvass byThe Electors Lists are the provisional Register prepared by the Registration Offioer as a result of his canvass,  etc. and are published to give an opportunity for claims and objections to be made before the final Register.is printed off.      At one time the electors Lists and the final Register of eaoh half yearly occasion were separately printed, throughout but in 1920 the present method,was instituted or publishing composite Electors Lists consisting of (aj the previous half-yearly Register;    7b) a list of additions, and (a) a list of deletions...    After, claims and objections have been dealt with on the composite electors Lists the three lists are combined in a final clean Register.SUPPLEMENTARY REGISTER SCHEME.
D.15-1Tthe Registration Officer, and those persons only who choose to make claims would be registered in respect of that period.     A list of such claimants would be printed as a supplement to the main annual register.      This would effect a saving estimated at  154,000,, reduced to  110,000 if it beoame necessary to revert to the more expensive previous system of publishing the Electors Lists.      This saving could be increased to about  817,000 by arranging for the main register to be issued without any previous printing and publication of electors lists;    on this plan claims and objections could be made on the register as issued, and the results included in short lists printed as supplements to the main register.     This scheme is, however, open to the objection that it involves the use at elections of composite registers, i.e. registers consisting of two or more documents, supplementing or correcting one another.      The introduction of this principle is looked upon with considerable apprehension by Registration Offiaers and Party Agents who on several occasions have advised that the use of composite registers at elections would entail very serious risks.The scheme is also open to the objeotion that the olaims for tho Spring Register period would in large measure have to be initiated by the Party Agents and would thus merely transfer to the political organisations muoh if not all the expense saved to the Exohequer by suppressing the Spring Register canvass.     Moreover, as ne revision of the main annual register would be made upon the issue of the Spring Register, there would be a very large number of duplioate registrations.In view of these objections it does not appear that the supplemental register scheme is a practicable alternative to the annual register.W.O.B..10th January, 192 3.
