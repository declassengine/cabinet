is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.-]220- 3,   Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1925.[Circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of Staters Instructions.]Letter from Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Sir Eyre Croiue.My dear Crowe, March 7,. 1925.I HAD a long conversation alone with M. Herriot after dinner last night. I told him that I had come with no idea of carrying on negotiations or making any proposals to him, but I was glad to have an opportunity of reviewing the situation in the light of what had passed since I last met him. I told him, in the first place, of our decision not to sign the protocol, giving two or three broad reasons and explaining that neither His Majesty&apos;s Government nor the dominions thought it wise or possible to extend so greatly the powers and the sanctions of the covenant. I added that we had considered whether we could propose amendments, but we had found that the changes which would be necessary were so great that this was not a practical course. Accordingly, I proposed to make an announcement to the League of our decision, in the form that I might find most convenient to my colleagues at Geneva, that the attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government would take up would not be entirely negative, we should point to the possibility of other arrangements.This brought me directly to the question of security. I said that I must talk to him with absolute frankness. I had to tell him, to my great personal regret, that neither the state of public opinion at home nor of public opinion in the dominions would allow us to enter into an Anglo-French or Anglo-Franco-Belgian pact. Any such proposal would be opposed by the whole strength of the Liberal and Labour party and by a considerable section of our own party. If we could carry it at all, it would thus be carried by a greatly diminished majority and as a purely party measure, and the other parties would certainly repudiate from the first any obligation to observe it. It would therefore at best be a purely party pact, certain to be terminated whenever there was a reversal of party fortunes. On the other hand,, the German proposals seemed to us to offer a hope of a solution in which we might co-operate. I developed at some length the reasons for which we attach so much, importance to this German step, and I said that if, as it seemed to us, it might lead to some mutual pact, including Germany, which would really increase the security of France and secure the peace of Europe, His Majesty&apos;s Government would do their utmost not to let it fail for want of British goodwill and help. I concluded by saying that I thought it best thus to define our attitude with complete frankness and with as much precision as was possible. I did not ask M. Herriot to give me any reply that evening or even to-day, but I would beg him most seriously to consider what I had said and to study the German proposals from the point of view of formulating the conditions which would render them acceptable to France and make them a real guarantee for European peace. Perhaps at some later time after such consideration he could authorise M. de Fleuriau to give me an aide-memoire of his views on this subject, which I could submit for the consideration of the British Cabinet. In the meantime; I should, of course, be interested to hear his first impressions, but I had no desire to commit him in any way at this stage.M. Herriot, who had listened in complete silence and with a face that became increasingly drawn as I proceeded, said that he must thank me for my frankness, but that he could not conceal that the decisions of the Government were a great disappointment and a great blow to him. In pursuance of his policy of appeasement he had associated himself very directly with the protocol, and undoubtedly its rejection was a serious thing for him. As regards the German proposals, he viewed them obviously with the gravest suspicion. He mentioned four points which at once struck him : First, did the Germans contemplate that it should be a condition of their offer that&apos; the fifteen years&apos; occupation of German territory should be shortened % To such a condition no French Government could possibly accede. Next, he turned to the eastern frontiers and to the distinction drawn in the German proposals between the frontiers of the east and west. He-was obliged to restrain the impetuosity of young States which might otherwise embroil France by their indiscretion, but Poland was an ally, and France must be very solicitous&quot; for her safety. The Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs, who 2737   [12809]7
arrived in Paris a day or two ago, had been with him that afternoon. For some reason which M. Herriot did not understand, whether distrust of himself or any other cause, he said nothing on this question, though he had given a long interview to the press, but the Ambassador had already been to him in great anxiety protesting that Poland could not consent to expose her boundaries to uncertainty. M. Herriot&apos;s third point was that the German proposals made no mention of the southern frontier. That certainly was a matter of immense importance to Italy. If we came to an agreement with Germany about the western and eastern boundaries and left the southern boundary unmentioned, Germany and Austria would unite in six months. Lastly, M. Herriot, observing that he knew Dr. Luther, thought him up to a point an honest man, recognised the truth of what I had said that these German proposals were more advantageous than anything which had yet been proposed to the Allies and were specially important as coming from Luther and his Cabinet, yet asked himself whether the whole thing were not really a manoeuvre by Luther for the purposes of his domestic policy. He had a majority of the Right in the background, but he was anxious, perhaps, to show certain liberal tendencies so as not to antagonise the Socialist majority. Then M. Herriot, becoming much more rhetorical, as Lord Crewe had warned me he often is, made me a speech of much feeling and evident emotion on the dangers which France ran. A propaganda of revenge was already being preached in every university and school. France, unable to restore her devastated regions, obliged to refuse money to.rebuild schools and hospitals, had yet been forced he might truly say forced by the United States to subscribe to the German loan. He must admit that it was humiliating to him to find into what dependence France had been brought by her misfortunes. France, struggling with her financial and economic situation, determined for he was determined to make a settlement of her debts whenever she could, saw Germany rapidly recovering, Luther able to make huge payments to the industrialists of the Ruhr and spend large sums on development. Germany was rapidly recovering her position. &quot;From my heart,&quot; he said, &quot; I tell you I look forward with terror to her making war upon us again in ten years.&apos;&apos;These are the general lines of the conversation. To these apprehensions and to the expression of his disappointment and difficulties he returned again and again, and I felt it would be unwise to argue too strongly at that moment on the other side. I told him, however, that Stresemann had informed Lord d&apos;abernon, in reply to an enquiry from me, that he had no idea of making the evacuation of the whole occupied territory a condition of his proposal. I added that it was curious that no mention was made of Belgium in any of the memoranda, not even in the one which had been handed in at Brussels, but I assumed that the guarantee of the frontiers of France would extend to those of Belgium, whilst if Germany was not going to war either on the east or the west, I could not believe that she intended to provoke trouble for the sake of restoring the Tyrol to Austria. M. Herriot sat silent for some time, and then asked what became of the League of Nations and of the covenant. I replied that our obligations under the covenant and to the League remained exactly what they were, but he himself had admitted that neither the covenant nor the protocol would give France the security^ that she needed. It was for this reason that he had sought the separate pact which it had been my duty to tell him it was out of the power of any British Government to accord, and it was for this reason that we desired him to consider most seriously whether that security might not be gained as a result of negotiations on the German proposals. What I did endeavour to do was to mark the framework within which His Majesty&apos;s Government thought that it would be possible for them to co-operate in this work. M. Herriot finally asked me to come and see him again to-day, after lunch, and said that he should say nothing of our interview. We must proceed in any case with the greatest caution. Time must be given for French provincial opinion to seize the problem and make itself felt, and Paris must not be allowed to explode before provincial opinion could make itself heard. More than that, M. Herrriot expressed &quot;the strong hope that I would stop in Paris on the way back, not, as it appeared, because he had in mind anything in particular that he would wish then to discuss with me, but because he was afraid that the differences which must arise between us at Geneva might give public opinion the impression of a rupture between France and ourselves, and that it was most important to do anything we could to prevent this impression getting abroad. He did not ask me for an immediate engagement, though he showed additional anxiety when he expressed a little doubt as to whether my parliamentary engagements would make it possible, and I then said I would make a point of doing it.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.
