r4 rtTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF Hid BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERKMEMT..   C A 3 I N H T. o secret &quot; Copy No___cJ 0CP, 189(25).&apos; FATING AND VALUATION.MEMORANDUM 3Y THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.,The Rating and Valuation Bill, the introduction of which was promised In the King1s speech, has now been revised in the light of representations which have been made to my Department and of the decisions of the Cabinet Committee on Rating and Valuation and Poor Law Reform,I am anxious to introduce the Bill at an early date, and it is essential that it should be read a second time very shortly after the Easter Recess if it is to pass this Session,     The Sill is of considerable length (some 70 - 80 clauses and 7 or 8 schedules) and it is, therefore, necessary that the Home Affairs Committee should have the Bill before them within the next few days, and I propose, Instead of sending the Bill first to the Cabinet Committee on Rating and Valuation and thence to the Home Affairs Committee, that the Bill should be referred direct to the Home Affaire Committee.     If the Cabinet approve of this proposal, I will circulate the revised draft of the Bill, together with a covering Memorandum, to the Home Affairs Committee in the course of next week.(IntldJ N.C,Ministry of Health.March 31st, 1925.
