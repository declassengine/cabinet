ffilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. RENT RESTRICTION.secret. MEMORANDUM   BY   THE   MINISTER OF   HEALTH&apos;. Copy Ho. ; tj, 129(55). *J IThe provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1920, as amended nd prolonged by the Rent Restrictions Act, 1923, will expire in England n the 24th June, and in Scotland on the 28th May, of this year, and it Is, herefore, necessary to obtain an early decision of the Cabinet as to the -overnment&apos;s immediate Rent Restriction policy.     I have already given otice of a Bill &quot;to prolong the duration of the Increase of Rent and ortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920, as amended by any subsequent aactment, and of Part 2 of the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) ct, 1923, and for purposes consequential thereon&quot;, and the question for $termination Is whether the existing provisions should be merely rolonged or whether circumstances render amendment in any respect desirableSome allegations for example have been made that exorbitant rents re being exacted for houses which have become decontrolled under the ovislons of the Act of 1923, and there has also been a certain amount of itiolsm on other points such as the hardship which It is stated falls on beneficiaries in small estates which cannot be wound up, owing to e restrictions on mortgages.I feel, however (and the Secretary for Scotland, with whom I have nferred, concurs In the view) that any proposal to Introduce amending gislation would stir up controversy and that the proper course to adopt merely to prolong the duration of the existing provisions.It is suggested that this prolongation should in the first stance be for two years only, which has already been stated to be the nimum period of extension contemplated by the Government, but that the 11 should be so drafted as to permit of a further continuance under the plring Laws Continuance Acts If this should prove to be necessary.nistry of Health, *ch 2nd, 1925.(Int Id)    N.C.
