THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAiiNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GCP7BRKMENT . SECRET. C A B I 11 E T .CP. 155 (25) . a 3THE RETAIL TRADE IN EOUSEHCLD COAL.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate to my colleagues a Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines regarding the question of Local Authorities trading in Household Coal.   Captain Garro-Jones&apos; motion on the Governments failure to deal with the question of coal prices to the consumer is the first private members1 motion at 8-15 on Wednesday, 25th March; I should therefore be glad to have a decision at the next meeting of the Cabinet.I hope the Cabinet will authorise the Secretary for Mines to use the proposed power if necessary.   The proposal is strictly limited.   It would only be used in proved cases where private enterprise has failed to give a satisfactory service.   The existence of the power will be the best way to ensure that the coal merchant sells at reasonable prices and manages his business efficiently.    On the other hand If we refuse this power, we put ourselves unreservedly in the hands of the coal merchants, for it has not been found possible to devise any practicable alternative check.I support the proposal in the interest of the general public, and also because I am convinced that its rejection would make a settlement of the difficulties in the mining industry harder than it is already.It is also consistent with the Tory principle of giving every opportunity to private enterprise, and cnly interfering where it is proved that private enterprise has failed&apos;to serve the community.(Intld.) P.C -L.Board of Trade,15th March, 1925 .
THE EETAIL TRADE IN HOUSEHOLD COAL.\Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.I ask that the Cabinet should sanction my making the suggestion, during the debate shortly to take place in the House of Commons on the cost of distribution and the retail price of coal to the-consumer, that if necessary the Government will legislate to allow Local Authorities to carry on a retail trade in coal.The only practical way of checking profiteering, if it exists, in the distribution of coal, is to set up effective competition.    This method of giving such powers to Local Authorities was proposed by all the members of the Sankey Commission, and also was recommended to his Cabinet by my predecessor.   During his tenure the proposal was fully discussed by the Mines Department with the Ministry of Health.    The Ministry pointed out certain objections to it and the plan eventually put forward contained safeguards designed to meet these objections as far as possible.    It was suggested in criticism of the proposal that - .(a) A Local Authority is at a disadvantage in having to accumulate an expert staff, provide railway tracks, trolleys, a site for the storage of coal and supplies of coal itself.(b) The margin of profit made by the traders is not encouraging.(c) A Local Authority must incur expense by storing Coal in the summer.(d) A Local Authority must make an annual provision for   repayment of capital that might be more than a trader has to make for depreciation.
o n r.:(e) Municipal Labour is more expensive than private labour.(f) If a Local Authority started to trade, the existing coal traders might. If working over a large area, as in London, be in a position to reduce their charges below those of the Local Authority and recompense themselves by raising their costs in other districts.   The Local Authority would then either have to reduce prices at the cost of the rates or be left without a market and in consequence sustain capital losses .But in reply to these objections I would point out that it is not suggested that local authorities shoxjld enter the coal trade unless local circumstances warrant it.    It is proposed that the Bill, which would apply only to Borough and Urban District Councils, should provide that if a Local Authority desires to trade in coal it must submit its proposals in writing to the appropriate Government Department, giving full details of the scheme of trading.    It would not be allowed to trade unless the Department had certified in writing its approval of the scheme of trading.    Eefore doing so, the Department would be required to hold such enquiry as It thought fit and would have power to require merchants or dealers who have supplied coal to consumers in the area of the local authority at any time during a period of twelve months preceding the submission of the proposals to furnish such accounts and statistics as may be demanded.    If the enquiry showed that the existing coal distributing organisation was able to supply the district efficiently? the application by the Local Authority would be refused.    If it showed that the district was notfceingef f ic iently served by the existing merchants or that unreasonable prices were being charged (and therefore that there was a likelihood of the authority&apos;s competing successfully) the application would be approved.
*1 pThe Local Authority would be required to carry on its Coal business so far as possible without profit or loss.    The surplus in any year, after the necessary provision for working expenses and loan charges, would be carried to the credit of the rate funds and any losses would he chargeable to the same account.    It would also be essential to provide that the Department may at any time, after reasonable notice, withn draw approval from any soheme, which would then cease to operate.It would appear that in certain respects a local Authority, so far from being at a disadvantage in competition with merchant would be    at a positive advantage.    It already knows all about buying horses, carts and lorries and their upkeep.    If it has a gas or electricity works - and many of them have - it knows all about the purchase of coal and perhaps of wagons and may even have a site for storage with sidings ready made.    It is better situated for buying coal than the private trader because,., it has a better credit.   And since it does not need the profit that a private trader requires to make it worth his while to trade, it should be possible for it to make the necessary, annual provision for the repayment of capital.Moreover, it must be remembered that the mere threat of effective competition may be enough,  and that such a measure as I suggest might well justify itself even if no Local Authority ever actually embarked on the coal trade,In view of the strong public belief that there is profiteering in coal distribution  - which has  been deliberately encouraged by the activities of my predecessor - I submit that the Government cannot leave the question alone and that this is the most effective method of dealing with it,   while providing safeguards against possible abuses of municipal, trading,  it would be a constant check on coal merchants, and
it would relieve the Government of the indirect responsibility for high retail prices of coal which the public is likely to fix upon it if nothing is done .   And while the question has not been acute during this winter owing to the mild weather and the very large stocks of coal consequently left in the dealers&apos; hands, it will most certainly be more acute next winter when stocks will not be likely to be so large.G.R. LANE POX
