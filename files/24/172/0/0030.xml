RJEJC. 1CABINET.c.p. i3o (25).COMMITTEE OU MARRIAGE ALLOWANCES FOR THE NAVYANDRATES OF PAY OP HEW ENTRANTS IN THE FIGHTINGSERVICES.Note lay the Secretary for Scotland.A preliminary Meeting of my Committee was held to-day.      It was considered that a ruling of the cabinet was necessary as to the precise scope of the Committee&apos;terms of Reference? which   are as follows:-&quot;A Cabinet Committee should &quot;be appointed to consider (Cabinet 9 (2J?) 2 (d)):-(i) The question of Marriage Allowances of the Navy, on the understanding thai; they should not make proposals liable to result in claims from the other Service Departments in regard %o marriage allowances:(il)   The reduction of the rates of pay of new entrants in the three Services, and to co-ordinate the various pro-posals in this connection:and that in the meantime the Admiralty should make provision in the Navy Estimates for Marriage Allowances on the understanding that only the sum required to carry out the recom-mendations of the Committee referred to above should be spent and that the amount should be included in the general votes and not shown in the estimates under a separate heading.&quot;2. The second part of the Terms of Reference wouldseem to $reolude consideration of the Pay and Allowances of officers and men already serving in the Navy, Army and Air Force.     It is understood that certain modifications of the 1919 Settlement, in addition to Marriage Allowances for the Navy, are considered desirable by the Departments, and I recommend, for the approval of the Cabinet, that the
following should be added to the Terms of Reference tothe Committee&quot;(iii)   Any proposals which may be submitted by the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry for altering the rates of Pay and Allowances of officers and men now serving.&quot;3. 771th regard to the first part of the Terras ofReference, it will be necessary for the Admiralty proposals (aa soon as they are received) for Marriage Allowances to be referred for the comments of the War Office and Air Ministry experts.     I wish to warn the Cabinet that the general sense of the Committee is that It is desirable not to attempt to make definite recommendations on these proposals before considering any adjustments which may be submitted under (iii).&apos;    JOKE GILMOIJR.(Chairman).2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 2nd March, 192
