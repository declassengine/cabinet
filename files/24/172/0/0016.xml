SECRET.---- j : Copy No.CP. 116(25).(Also C.I.D. 597-B.)CABINET.FRENCH SECURITY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. I circulate a note by the General Staff on the subject of French security.L. W.-E.The War office,26th February, 1925.1. In C.I.D- paper, No. 516-B, and elsewhere the General Staff have developed their view that a mutual defensive pact or alliance against Germany is an essential condition of French, Belgian and British security and an essential preliminary to, the development of a peaceful atmosphere in Western Europe.2. The fact that in France the fear of Germany is profound and universal was forcibly impressed by Lord Cecil upon the Committee of Imperial Defence at their meeting on 13th February, 1925. This fear which infects the leading French soldiers,, has become intensified by the prospect of the approaching evacuation of the Cologne zone.. It is much more than an anxiety over the German infractions in regard to. disarmament; it is rather for the future than for the present, and it is based, upon Germany&apos;s inevitable industrial and. economic expansion and the capacity to go to war which this will confer;The French realize that the power to go to, war depends more; and! more upon the capacity for industrial mobilization. France&apos;s. future: as regards this capacity,, and as, regards the man-power necessary to implement it, does nob. inspire her soldiers: with, confidence.3. The question, at issue is clearly not well understood, by the majority of the British public.. For us it,is only incidentally a question of French security ; essentially it. is ai matter, of British security. .        ,If Germany, or any power with.Germany&apos;s mentality and future, inevitable strength, were established on or&quot; within easy reach, of. the.: eastern shores, of the,North Sea and. English Channel,, we would at once finds ourselves, under a constant threat of aggression-,, necessitating a scale of naval, military and air preparedness so unbearable as to., lead, inevitably, to a collision.. - .,This would have happened had France not been saved from, defeat by our interven-tion in the last, war, and it is what Germany intended should happen, had, everything,gone according to, plan.. i iThe true strategic frontier of Great Britain, is. the Rhine-.;, her security, depends, entirely upon the present frontiers of France, Belgium and Holland; being maintained; and remaining in friendly hands. The., great: guiding principle of the German General Staff in making plans for a future war will be, as, in, the, last, war, to try to defeat her, enemies in detail. Any line of policy, which, permitted Germany (with, or without, allies); first to swallow up France, and then to deal with Great Britain would be fatal strategically. It is for these reasons that the General Staff view with alarm a suggestion which has been put forward to the effect that because France must become weaker and Germany must become stronger, we would therefore be well advised to allow France to meet defeat unaided rather than to show a united front to the German menace of the future.2U/Pfcg/.-i64   100   2/25   w.o.p.   1743    &apos;This document is the property ot His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, February, 3 925.
4. The General Staff are far from sharing the pessimistic views held by French military opinion as regards the imminence of the German danger ; but they have repeatedly admitted the eventual danger, and they can foresee how precarious would be the French military situation vis-d-vis.Gevma.nj. if,, when the safeguards remaining under the Treaty of Versailles disappear, France is left to face Germany alone.The military preparations which would be required to satisfy Germany that she was sufficiently strong to undertake an aggressive war against France and the British Empire combined must obviously be far greater than those she would regard as sufficient to undertake a war against France unaided. Such preparations would take longer to perfect and would therefore automatically postpone the danger of war.Given, then, the necessary allied cohesion and military co-operation on the Rhine ; the maintenance of French military strength at an adequate standard ; the determination by Great Britain to support her army on the Rhine by mobilization it necessary ; the proper organization and supervision of the demilitarized zone by the League of Nations ; British command of the sea ; and the reaffirmation of allied solidarity which a pact with France and Belgium for a period of (say) 25 years would give : then the French and British General Staffs &quot;should be able to guarantee to their Governments a period of immunity from attack by Germany in the West for 10 years from the date of evacuation of the Cologne zone.But the General Staff consider that a Military Pact is an essential item in these conditions.5. At the end of ten years, when the last bridgehead over the Rhine reverts to Germany, Germany&apos;s chances of going to war with success will be increased, if she is resolved on war. A Brutish alliance with France will then be the one great, and possibly sufficient, deterrent ; but it will be only a deterrent, and the military rivalry of pre-war days will be renewed. But, given a pact with France, there ought to be ten years from now in which allied statesmen, the League of Nations, and possibly the moderate elements in Germany itself, will be free to develop the conditions essential to a lasting peace. The development of these conditions is not a military problem. The allied forces can only hold the ring so that statesmanship may have a free hand.6. France&apos;s fear of Germany is the dominating psychological military factor in Europe at the moment. It can only be allayed by the influence and active support of Great Britain. If it is not allayed, it may lead either to France anticipating the inevitable and attacking Germany, with disastrous results to Europe&apos;s recovery and to the general reduction of armaments ; or to France, in desperation, allying herself to Germany, which would be the end of British security. In any case, unless allayed, this French obsession will render impossible the development of stability and peace.7. The General Staff fully realize that there can be no real military security in Europe until Germany herself subscribes to a general policy of non-aggression. They do not, therefore, regard a military pact with France and Belgium as an end in itself ; it can be no more than a temporary expedient designed to give security until such time as it can be reinforced by mutual pacts of non-aggression entered into by Germany and her neighbours, or until it can be developed into a larger alliance including Germany herself. But Germany has shown that she has a long way yet to travel towards grace before any such further developments can become possible or admissible. The present military situation in Western Europe is pregnant with great possibilities ; it calls for immediate treatment. The hoped-for settlement as regards disarmament and the consequent cessation of effective control; the approaching evacuation of the Cologne area ; the inauguration of the Dawes Scheme ; Prussian ascendancy in Germany ; French fear- for the security of France and pessimism regarding France&apos;s future ; the coming assumption by the League of Nations of their responsi-bilities under the Treaties of Peace : all these combine to produce a situation which cannot be liquidated unless the British Empire, which is at once the most fitted, the most powerful, and one of the most interested of the Great Powers, is prepared to play a leading part.Every military consideration points to the necessity of our placing ourselves openly and resolutely by the side of France. .If the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles are to serve their intended purpose of producing in the scheduled time a general settlement and relief from threats of war, German militarism must be confronted now by an alliance strong enough to prevent any interference with the processes of peace.8. Disarmament is perhaps the chief ideal which underlies the Geneva Protocol, and disarmament is therefore closely connected with the problem of security.So long as France is left to rely upon her own resources for security, so long can
* N.D. Paper No. 68.there be no possibility of her agreeing to reduce the size and strength of her military and air forces, and so long as this remains the case there can be little hope of improvement in the present situation, which in some respects almost involves us in competition with France.France maintains the military and air forces which she regards as necessary in view of the preponderance of man-power which is one of Germany&apos;s great assets.  -To a considerable extent we base the strength of our air force upon the requirements of adequate protection against &quot; Air attack by the strongest Air Force within striking distance of this country.&quot;* In the absence of a pact with France, as control in Germany decreases and as her air force (which may be ostensibly civil) increases, so must the French air force increase and so must we increase our own, basing our organization rather upon home defence than upon Imperial responsibilities.If a pact with France were still in existence, ensuring as it would not only military and air force assistance, but also the complete control of European waters by our Navy it would be sufficient for France and Great Britain to maintain between them, at home, a sufficient air force to deal with Germany, and it should be possible to arrange with France that our proportion should be such as adequately to safeguard our security.The suggested pact might thus pave the way to a first stage in disarmament.9. The General Staff realize that from the Imperial point of view it would be all important for the Dominions to adhere to such a pact as is under consideration.From the purely military point of view, however, they have never counted upon the assistance of the Dominions in the early stages of a campaign, and from that point of view there appears to be no necessity to obtain from them any promise which would tie the hands of their Governments and Parliaments, or which would force them in advance to adopt a course which they would wdllingly take if their hands were free.10. In conclusion, the General Staff would once more emphasize the- fact that &quot; French Security&quot; spells &quot; British Security,&quot; that French morale is at the present very low, even in the higher military circles, and that to anyoue that can look ahead, with French eyes, this depression is easy to understand. There is no doubt that with the announcement of an extension and renewal of the British alliance the barometer would immediately rise. It is most necessary that it should rise, because we are now faced with a number of decisions which we must take together, and which will vitally affect the course of events. The more frightened the French, are the more tiresome they become, and they will block every move unless we can allay their fear. It is curious that Englishmen seem to be least able to realise the greatness of their own country, or to understand how much, to a Frenchman, for instance, the support of the British Empire means.If it is to our interest and to the interest of civilization (as it most obviously is) to fortify France, we can do it, and do it decisively.It must be remembered that we still maintain a garrison on the Rhine, and that this implies the obligation to reinforce it in case of necessity up to the limit that the situation may demand. We have already therefore a military commitment which, for the next ten years, would not be perceptibly increased by a pact on the lines proposed.But, in. the view of the General Staff, a pact is essential to reaffirm (a) For the benefit of France and Germany that we have no intention of evading this commitment, and(6) That we intend to continue to stand by France for sufficient time after the safeguards have been removed to ensure a peaceable attitude on the part of Germany over what inay, if the efforts of statesmanship fail, or are delayed, be a most dangerous period.
