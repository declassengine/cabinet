ISIS DOCUMENT IS THE PBOPEKTY OF HIS BBITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 8 GOVERNMENT)S B 0 B E T&quot; CABIN EJP^160 (25).LONDON UNIVERSITY. KING1 S .QQH,BGJ3 ANDgHa..JSyiaSri^fS INSTITUTE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I have read Sir George Barstowvs minute regarding his proposal to hand over the Imperial Institute building to London University, whioh was circulated to the Cabinet on the 9th of March under cover of a note by the Chancellor of &apos; the Exchequer (CP. 143(25)).At the outset,  I should like to say that I have no objection whatever to Sir- George Barstowls scheme being considered on its merits by the new governing body of the Institute, when constituted.    The only question that arises is whether it is advisable to provide for its future appli-cation by amending the Clause of the Imperial Institute Bill which relates to the control of the Imperial Institute building.There is no doubt whatever in my mind that any intima-tion at the present stage of a proposal to hand over the entire Institute building to the University of London would cause the Government the greatest embarrassment in Parliament.It would be impossible for the Government to propose any change in the terms of the Bill without giving a reasonfor it, and we could not mislead Parliament by not dis-dosing our real objects in making an amendment howevertrivial it might appear.    How I am satisfied that any hint ofan intention to hand over the Institute building for other purposes would so upset the Oversea Governments and moreoverarouse so much opposition among the supporters of the institute both in and out of Parliament as to wrack the bill and with it the settlement at which we arrived with so much difficulty during the Economic Conference. Frankly,  I cannot-1-
conceive any more certain method of undoing the. whole of our work about the Institute at the Conference.To make any such change in the Bill without preliminary negotiation with the Dominions would he a breach of faitho I am quite prepared at the proper time to negotiate with the Dominions, but quite apart from any question of the delay involved, I am satisfied that to do so now would jeopardize the whole schema0    It is an essential preliminary to such negotiation that the Conference scheme should have been oarried out by us, and that there should be a Governing Body prepared to support the change.   Until these conditions have been satisfied it would be fatal to allow any intimation of our intentions to be made, even such an intimation as would be conveyed by a merely permissive amendment of the BilloMy suggestion, therefore, is that the Bill, which has now been read a second time in the Commons, should be allowed to proceed through its remaining stages in its present form and become law at the earliest possible date. As soon as the new Governing Body of the Institute for which the Bill provides has been established, oir George Barstow^ proposals should, if otherwise approved, be laid before them for consideration.    It is common ground that before his scheme could be carried into effect the consent of the Oversea&quot; Governments, whose representatives attended the Conference^ would be required.      Once the approval  of the new Governing\ Body, which will include representatives of the Dominions an$. India, has been obtained,  it should be a comparatively simple, matter to arrange for a short ^mending Bill to be passed to give effect to the scheme.I therefore earnestly hope that my colleagues will agree to the Imperial Institute Bill being allowed to proceed without delay  in its present form.L.S.AMi X0Colonial Office,Downing Street,16th Marchi 1925.
