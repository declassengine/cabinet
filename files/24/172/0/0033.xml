COii/committee,.The Unemployment Committee have had under considers-tioh the question whether Government assistance to works of public utility carried out by Local authorities during the coming spring and summer and the winter 1985/26 should continue to be given by the Unemployment Grants Committee, and, if so, whether there should be any modification of the !i&apos;erms and Conditions of Grant, -The present unemployment position is substantially the same as it was a year ago, and, so far as it is possible to judge,  there is no reason to suppose that, the situation during the next twelve   months will differ materially from the situation in 1924/25.      in these circumstances the Committee consider that it will be necessary, both from the point of view of relieving unemployment and also from the politival point of view, to continue the existing arrangements during 1925/26.   After examining the existing Terms end Conditions of the Grants administered by the unemployment.oyment Grants Committee the Unemployment Committee are of opinion that those Terms and Conditions should remain unaltered during the coming year.In previous years the Unemployment Grants Committee have circularised Local Authorities on the subject of schemes of work,  the 1924 circular issuing on February 27th, and the Committee favour the early issue of a similar circular the present year.S E C.

DRAFT CIRCULARSir,I am directed hy the Unemployment Grants Committee to refer to their previous Circular Letters with regard to sofaernes of work undertaken hy Local Authorities with State assistance for the relief of unemployment during the Winters 1922-3, 1923-24 and 1924-25.   . . .The Government appreciate very fully the cordial and, wholehearted manner in which Local.Authorities have co-operated with them in providing employment by the execution of extensive public works during the last four Winters.In view of the extent to which unemployment is still prevalent, the Government propose to continue to assist and encourage-the execution of works of public utility during the Winter 1925-26 as has been done during the preceding Winters, and they trust that they may rely on the co-operation of Local Authorities in this matter as heretofore. \As regards the Winter of 1925-26 the Government will acoordingly be glad if Local authorities still affected by unemployment will during the,coming Spring consider what further works could be put in hand during the Winter should the circum-stances of their districts appear likely to render this necessary.As in the case of schemes, submitted for the recent Winter the Committee propose to dispense with the preliminary state-ments which had been required In previous years and to invite Local Authorities to submit comprehensive proposals for their localities In the form of definite schemes accompanied by the usual plans and details.The Committee would be glad if Local Authorities would submit these schemes if possible by the 1st August and in any event not later than 1st September 1925.    If, in any case in which considerable cost would be involved in the preparation of a soheme the Local Authority would wish to be - informed whether the soheme is&apos; one which woiild be approved if unemployment continues acute, the Committee will be prepared to give the information, on submission - of the- soheme to them in broad out-line not later than the 1st May, 1925.In the meanwhile the Unemployment Grants Committee have been authorised to continue to receive applications for, and to grant financial assistance in respect of, approved schemes of work to commence during the Spring: and Summer of 1925.
