(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY O? HIS BRITANNIC MA J majesty&apos;s T Y1S GOVERNMENT)SEC BJL1CP. 128(25)..-     - CABINETTRANSACTION Off BUSINESS DURING THE KINGTS* ABSBMOE ABROAD.Memorandum by the Lord President of the council I think it desirable that the Cabinet should be informed of the steps to be taken for the transaction of business during the King1s absence.    It is proposed to follow the precedent of 1911, subject to one exception. In that year when His Majesty visited India, Letters Patent authorised by Order in Council were issued to Prince Arthur of Connaught, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor and the Lord President, empowering them to hold meetings of the Privy Council and to transact business there and to transact on the King&apos;s behalf with certain savings any necessary business.I have consulted the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General on the measures now to be taken.The Lord Chancellors view is as follows:-1.     The precedent of 1911 holds the field, and, subject as hereinafter mentioned, should be followed.E.     The words &quot;and for the purposes of these Presents any instructions transmitted by Us by telegram or other svich means of communication shall have the same effect as if they were given by Us in writing under Our Sign Manual&quot; should be omitted.So far as they appear to give authority to affix theSign Manual to documents which by Statute require the SignManual, they are ineffective.   As regards other Sign Manualdocuments, they can be dealt with by the Commissionersunder the general words,  save in so far as His majesty may indicate to the Commissioners that he desires them not...1-
to use these powers in respect of any particular document of class of document.The Attorney General agreed with the opinion expressed by the Lord Chancellor, but he added that the matter had been put to him orally and without an opportunity for prolonged consideration, and that it was possible that a more prolonged consideration of the matter and of the document of 1911, might disclose further difficulties which have not been foreseen or met.    In all the circurn-stsnoes he thought it best to proceed as was proposed.The Commissioners on this occasion will be Prince Henry, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President and the Prime Minister.CPrivy Council Office, February 28th, 1925.NOTE: The Secretary attaches for information a copy of the Draft Commission.
