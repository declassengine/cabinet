Under that Clause the parents of illegitimate children, whose legitimation is effected by the subsequent marriage of their parents, are required to re-register the births of those children,. If they neglect to fulfil this duty they will become liable to penalties, but the legitimation of the children will not be affected.2.   A new Clause (Clause 3) has been inserted enabling an illegitimate person to- take proceedings for the establishment of his legitimation, similar to
those which he could have taken under the Legitimacy Declaration Act, 1858, if he bad been born in wedlock.3.    1 should draw attention to subsection (2) of Clause 1 of the Bill, which will exclude from the operation of the Act an illegitimate person whose father or mother was married to a third person when the illegitimate person was born.    ITsis provision will no doubt give rise to controversy;    but it has been twice affirmed in the House of Lords by substantial majorities, and I am convinced that it should be retained.(Intd.),House oxLords ,19 thFebruary 1925.-2-
