This document is the property of His Britannic Majeaty&apos;s Government.        510Printed for the Cabinet, April, 1925.SECRET.Copt No.    &apos;x 0&quot;CP. 191 (25).THE CABINET.IMPERIAL WAR GRAVES COMMISSION ENDOWMENT FUND.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The Chancellors proposal limits the amount to be payable by the Treasury to an     118 average of  922,500 a year for 4 years, a sum which is approximately the amount of the   General estimated expenditure on capital and upkeep accounts of the Commission during those     103 years, without making any provision during those years for an endowment fund.The Chancellor proposes that in the fifth and subsequent ten years the contribution to the endowment fund shall commence, and that the Treasury shall pay about  333,634 a year.This counter-proposal compares with the scheme of the War Graves Commission for an annual contribution from the Treasury of  .1,222,800 (which is the Treasury&apos;s present payment) for a period of 6J years.The Cabinet accepted the proposal for an endowment fund in principle, but left the period during which the fund was to accumulate open for further discussion.The Chancellor has postponed for 4 years the commencement of the endowment, which I submit was not the intention of the Cabinet nor the proposal of the Dominions.As I understood the decision of the Cabinet, the endowment was to commence at once ; I am anxious not to put too heavy a charge on the early years, and if the  1,222,800, the present charge is considered by the Chancellor to be excessive, I would agree to a scheme such as the following :  1,125,000 for each of the first 2 years, and  1,000,000 a year for each of the next 3 years,and about 500,000 a year for each of the next 6 years.Having regard to the capital during the next few years, it is not possible to reduce the early payments if any reasonable contribution is to be made to the Endowment Fund.L. W.-E.The War Office,1st April, 1925.(B25/17)   100   4/25   W.O.P.   1793
