They have no need for benefits while serving as they are fully looked after by the army.The latter are entitled to all ordinary benefits under the Act, but under Section 46 (3) (h) of the 1911 Act (S,59 (2) of the 1924 Act) they are debarred from additional benefits granted by Approved Societies,    The number at present in the Fund is 23,212; excluding serving soldiers etc.     While-    . the surplus of some  3,000,000 is mainly due to tiie reasons given in the Treasury Memo.; it is in part due to the feet c,, thet-additional benefits have not   been granted as in the case of Approved Societies, although the payment from Army Funds during service, and contributions after discharge, are at the same rate as for   members of Approved Societies.I consider that the man whose health has become impaired during service should not be in a worse position for insurance purposes than his comrade who is discharged fi* and that the surrender of the surplus to the Exchequer should therefore be subject to retention by the.fund of such sum as may be necessary to secure to members of-the Fund similar additional benefits to those enjoyed by members of Approve a societies.
&quot;When the 1911 Aot was passed adltional benefits were &quot;barred because of the extra liability they might throw on the Servioa Departments which are required to keep the Fund solvent - now that the Fund has a large surplus an opportunity presents itself to remove the bar.It seems that a fair compromise would be to surrender one half (or perhaps two-thi^ds) of the surplus, but the proportion can be settled between the Minister, the Service Departments and the Government actuary at leisure.If my proposal is accepted in principle all that is immediately necessary is to add a clause to the Bill providing -(l)   That the provisions of S. 59 (2) ofthe 19.24 Act which bar additional benefits for members of the Fund shall be cancelled.(2)   That in arriving at the sum to be transferred under 3. 1 of the Bill the Treasury and Ministry fch&amp;ll allow for the Fund retaining ouch a capital1 esttsi as may be oonaideafud necessary to provide additional benefits for membera who reasain in the Fund aftar their discharge from fee Havy, Army and Air Force on the lines laid down in schedule 3 to the 1924 Aot.I fe^Ssl eonfidsnt that my colleagues will agree that we should take this opportunity of setting right what I cannot but regard &amp;s an injustice to a most deserving class, due to a oare for the public purse which the accumulation of the surplus owing to the Great War makes no longer necessary.(Intd.)
