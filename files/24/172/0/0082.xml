(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government),SECRET.CABIN E T. m ssCP. 188(25). ---- 3&amp;NIGHT CLUES BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I understand my colleagues desir9 a little further information as to the reasons for this Bill.They will be awar9 perhaps that  this is not the? first occasion when the matter has been before Parliament. In 1915 the Clubs  (Temporary Provisions) Bill was passed for the continuance  of the War.In moving its Second Reading in the House of Lords on November 4th, 1915, Lord Curzon said &quot;It was designed to put an end to a great scandal by arresting, the growth of night clubs, which were haunts of temptation and dens of iniquity in our great towns; they were snares provided to trap the unwary, there were in them scenes of drinking, gambling and immorality.&quot;In introducing the Bill in the House  of Commons Sir John Simon,  then Home Secretary,  said &quot;these institutions are the resort of every kind of scoundrel and harpy,&quot;In January of this year I received a deputation introduced by the Bishop of London and representing practically ovary Christian Church and Social Organisation in London, unanimously asking me to take steps to revive three  of the main provisions of the 1915 Act,  so far as regards night clubs:-    (l)  to prohibit harbouring of any Undesirable persons in night clubs;     (2) to provide
satisfactory methods of regietration;    (3) to provide for the entry of police officers, not under the rank of Inspectors, at any time to night clubs.The speeches whioh were made &quot;by the s9 gentlemen were corroborated by the Commissioner of Police. I  obtained a long report from him and he put before me  the difficulties as follows:-.... First,  the difficulty of obtaining evidence as distinct from mere information of what tak9S place inside.Second, the difficulty even if a search warrant is obtained,  in executing it in such a way as to secure the evidence necessary.My colleagues will be aware that though the Polio9 may have reason to suppose that the law as to the sal9  of intoxicating liquors is being evad9d flagrantly,  they cannot get a warrant until they oan prove to the  satisfaction of the magistrate that enough has actually taken place to justify him in issuing a warrant.Beyond this, having got the warrant, it is very difficult to get in.      At Lamb&apos;s Club, for instance, the only access was by a small lift.      In the Quadrant case there was an elaborate system of doors and bells to obstruct entry.Further, persons who are notoriously making huge profits out of the illegal sale  of liquor in a night club can,  immediately after one is raided and closed,  open another one   (even in the same building.) and the whole  trouble begins over again.      I need only mention the well known case of Mrs. Merrick who with her daughter seems to ring the changes
in regard to the setting up of her night clubs.It may be said  &apos;why interfere with these clubs&apos;.    In the first instance my reply    would be,  that there is a strong belief that these clubs are not only breaking the law in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquors,   but are in certain cases the haunts of very undesirable characters, and that young men are in consequence led astray in a way they would not be in decently conducted licensed premises.    The law provides generally speaking -to take the Metropolis alone - that no drink may be  supplied in any club after 11 o&apos;clock in the evening,   and that all drink so supplied must be  consumed before 11.30 o&apos;clock, or if a special certificate is obtained under Section 3 of the Licensing Act,   1921,   12 and 12.30 respectively.If my colleagues desire that unlimited drinking should go on through all hours of the night,   let us alter the licensing hours and enact accordingly,  but I think in that case the enactment would have to extend to the licensed public-house or restaurant.If my colleagues are not prepared for this course,  I submit that it is perfectly clear that the law must be obeyed.    There is nothing worse in this or any other country than the enactment of laws which are openly disobeyed by sections of the community,  and my reason for asking leave to bring in this Bill is that some further steps are required to enable us to see that the law whatever it may be is obeyed.The plan of the Bill is, first,  to take the existing law  (Sections 91,  etc.  of the Licensing (Consolidation) Act,   1910) as to the registration of clubs which applies to all clubs,  good or bad,  supplying liquor on their premises, and add to it special provisions relating to night clubs. I have had considerable difficulty in giving a statutory
meaning to the common term &quot;night club&quot;, but 1 suggest that the phrase should be treated as meaning any club required to be registered which is habitually used or intended to be used for the purpose of dancing at night  (i.e. between 6 p.m and 6 a.m.  see Clause 10) or for any purpose of the club between 12.30 and 6&apos; o&apos;clock in the morning.I think the words I have adopted (&quot;habitually used&quot;) would prevent,  for example,  the occasional user of the Garlton for an extra rubber or two of bridge after 12.30 making it a night club;     and clubs open all night,  e.g.  for the accommodation of printers,  etc., and clubs giving only sleeping accommodation are exempted by the FrovisoeH    (a) and (b) respectively to the definition in Clause 1.New provisions as to the registration of night clubs will be found in Clauses 2 to 4.    The main innovation is that,  whereas ordinary clubs find registration almost a formality done once for all except for change of circumstance night clubs will have to register annually and give an opportunity for the raising of objections which will have to be settled by a Court.    Objections may be lodged by the Chief Officer of Police or the Local Authority or any person occupying or owning property in the neighbourhood,  but by no one else,  on the new grounds specified in Clause 3.Apart from this the main new provision in the Bill upon which I rely is Clause 7 which gives authority to an officer of Police, not below the rank of Inspector,  and authorised by the Chief Officer,  i.e.  the Commissioner of Police in London,   to enter any premises used or suspected to be used as a night club at all times and see whether the law is being broken or not*At present,  as my colleagues know,  the Police have had to adopt every kind of subterfuge to get into a club and it is not good for Police officers to act as camouflaged spies.
E42-6.What objection could be taken to this proposal? It will not in the least degree hurt well conducted night clubs,  of which doubtless some of my colleagues could give me the addresses.    There would be no objection to an officer making an inspection and my colleagues will remember that during the war this right existed in regard to all clubs including our own and was never found to be in the least degree burdensome.I have been very careful as I said before to avoid anything that would appear harsh or in the nature of kill-joy legislation,  but I believe the  country does demand a better regulation of these clubs,   and I say with full sense of responsibility as the political head of the London Police that they cannot conduct their duties effectually and efficiently without some such powers as I am now asking for.Finally,  I may mention that  clause  9 contains a provision as to the  controller of any club knowingly allowing it to be used as an habitual resort of prostitutes or gamesters.I  see no harm in including this,  which will be of assistance to the Police,  but it -will be for my colleagues to decide whether they will include it or not.W.  J. H.27th March,   1925.
