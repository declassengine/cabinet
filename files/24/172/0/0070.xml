. . 362liis document is. the. property of His. Britannic.Majesty^ Government.CABINET. POSITION OF CHURCH SCHOOLS. MEMORANDUM BY THE EPJBSIDENT OF TH3 BOARD OF EDtJOATION.(sr.- &apos; .170(25). .        I think the Cabinet should know that we may shortly have to consider legislation in regard to Church Schools.There ia no doubt that the settlement reached in 1902 is breaking down;   Both the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church have been finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil their obligations under that Act by keeping their Schools in good repair and making&apos;necessary improvements and they are now&apos;faced with the necessity of enlarging, reconstructing or replacing a number of buildings which are in greater br less degree unfit for continued use.Various schemes for a new general settlement are being suggested, and&apos;the Government may have to define its attitude before long.   I think one or two conclusions ere fairly clear:1.     Denominational bitterness has died down to a very great extent in the last fifteen years, and there is a very general desire amongst all leaders of religious opinion to prevent the revival of old controversies.2.     The same cannot, however, be said of the leadersof political opinion.   The Liberal party machine in the constituencies is still intensely suspicious and fv&quot;  &apos;&apos;&quot; keenly alive to the party value of the old war-cries. &apos;&apos;  &apos;:&apos;   The Free Church Council wants peace but it could easily be stampeded by irreconcilable politicians. 3.     The members..of every denomination are divided
among themselves as to the nature of the settlement to be aimed at.   the only point on which there is general agreement is that the christian religion in some form should be taught in all schools. 4.     in these circumstances, no new general agreed settlement is at present possible for the country aa a whole.   any settlement that could be proposed would bring the whole.question once more into the region of party polemics.5.     on the other hand, agreed local, settlements are not: at all impossible.   many local authorities are faced with the prospect that having no power to give financial assistance to church schools, they will hav to provide new schools out of the rates.   many of the (for instance, i think, liverpool and the west hiding are prepared, in principle to make arrangements with the church authorities covering certain schools or groups of schools, and are only prevented from doing so by the present state of the law,i am therefore inclined to think that we shall find it necessary to introduce legislation next year giving local authorities wider powers to make arrangements with church authorities - for instance, to accept the transfer of church schools on special conditions, includi the continued provision of denominational instruction or even&apos;to permit denominational teaching in selected council schools as part of an arrangement covering groups of schools.   at the same time we could, i think, lay down that christian teaching should be given in all schools (subject of course to a conscience clause) and that in council schools this teaching should be in accordance with a syllabus drawn up by the local sducation authority,
ii y 0after consultation with the various religious denominations if they are willing to co-operate.   In many areas syllabuses of this kind have already been agreed by the representatives of all denominations, except Roman Catholics, and this could probably be done in all areas without difficulty.I believe such legislation, would meet with little serious opposition, provided we could show that it was designed to enable Local Authorities to do what they want to do in agreement with the other parties concerned.   We need not commit ourselves, and indeed I think it is most important that we should not commit ourselves in any way at this stage, as to the nature of any future legislation, but I should like to take an early opportunity of encouraging-ing Local Authorities to communicate to me their views, and any particular arrangements which they would desire to make and could carry out if permitted if they desire to do so. I append a draft of the kind of statement I contemplate.E.P.19th February.
&quot;le are making a great effort to improve school premises throughout the country.   The Board have been and are still conducting a survey of premises and have already communicated the results of that survey to the Local Education Authorities and to the Managers of Voluntary Schools in urban areas.     As I have frequently said in public, the Circulars which we have sent to Local Education Authorities and Managers are not to be regarded as dogmatic statements of what must be done, but rather as invitations to those bodies to exchange views with us and work out an agreed policy of improve-ment over the next few years.I realise that any such exchange of views1 must raise, in an acute form, in some areas at any rate, the question of the &quot;dual system&quot;.   I have refrained hitherto from any reference to the &quot;dual system0 because I am cqnvinced that the problems involved in that system can only be solved by consent and I doubt whether tfe*s process of solution can be anything but gradual.   But &apos; it is clear that no one responsible for the well-being   -and proper education of the children of this country can ignore the difficulties of the present situation or the discussions now proceeding in regard to them nor can he fail to be struck by recent pronouncements showing that an overwhelming body of opinion, irrespective of party or denomination, earnestly desires that provision shall be made everywhere for giving good and effective religious teaching in elementary schools.I want,therefore, to say quite clearly thatif any Local Authority, after full discussion with the managers of Voluntary Schools in its area, comes to theconclusion that it can best deal with the educationalproblems arising in connection with particular schools or groups of schools, or even generally in connection with all4.
schools in its area, by adopting a course of action which, though desirable in the interests of education and generally satisfactory to all sections of local opinion, cannot be properly pursued within the provisions of the Education Acts as they at present; stand?   they need not hesitate to inform me of their views or put them in the form of specific proposals; , I want to see adequate provision made for the needs of the children; I want that $revision made, in the most practical form: I.want agreement as to. what those   needs are and how they can.best be satisfied.   If Local Authorities consider that they would be better.-able -to meet those requirements if some amendment were made in the existing law, I am prepared to consider such an amendment;   if Local Authorities desire wider discretion for this purpose, I am in principle prepared to ask Parliament to give them that discretion. *
