(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERHMEHTjCABINS?, mLord Burnham? s award on Teachers&apos; Salaries,ICe!MaRANDUI^.BY,,.TIIE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF iHDUCATION,(25).I circulate herewith Lord Burnham1a three Awards for -Elementary, Secondary, and Technical Education in the arbitration on Teachers&apos; Salaries,,     I also circulate a Memorandum showing the estimated financial effect of these Awards^     As  1 have pointed out in the Memorandum, it is not necessary at this moment to take any decision on the Recommendations which are annexed to the Awards., hut as the Scales awarded are to date from April 1st the Cabinet should, if possible,  come to an immediate decision on the Awards themselves,,     I am consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this point with a view to making a definite recommendation to the Cabinet at its next meeting.2nd April 1925,&quot;E9P.fl
LORD, Bu^iniAM&apos; S AWARD .jpn,.. X^CB1RS,;.. - SALARIES,, MEKQRAjjDXJM, fey... the,. jR^IppfT of the 30.ART) OS1 EDUCATION.I he financial effect of the Bumham Awards is:-i. HiJBaffiancAjQf. &quot; -(i) to reduce the salary expenditure of Local Education Authorities &quot;by an amount whioh,  on the present , number of teachers, would rise in five years to  1,120,000 by stages of, say:-First year *,.,......     45Oc0O0Second year . r........     800,000Third year * *40.*,...  1,000^000Fourth year P,r. ......  1.100,000Fifth year *,..,..v.e  1J120JOO0(li) if the non^Burnham areas were now brought up to the standard of the new scales, it is estimated, but this figure is necessarily uncertain,, that the additional salary expenditure incurred would diminish by  300., 000 the saving stated above,(iii) to increase the pension cost on future awards.,whether for past or for future service, by a little less than one per cent,,  representing an ultimate increase in pensions of about  80,000 per annum,;,(iv) to reduce the net exchequer receipts from pension contributions by about  72,000,(v) by thus disturbing the ratio of contributions to benefits, to-affect the Pension Account to be. set up under the Superannuation Bill in respect of its actuarial surplus or deficit as the case may bo.The Deputy Government Actuary has studied the effect ofthe Award, so far as time permitted, and concurs generally inthis statement of the financial effectsII6 5-15C0HDARYoThe changes in the scales impose a probationary period of two years on men and women alike before any increment begins4 The men&apos;s increments are slightly increased as compared with 95 per cent, of Burnham,; and women1 s increments are diminished ( 14. 5s, falls to  12,  and  11* 17b. 6d* falls to  9).     The maxima are slightly increased on most of the scalesBIt is evident -that the finanoial effect of these changes&apos;cannot&apos; be greats     It is estimated that the new scales as applied to existing teachers would produce a saving of
 77,000 per annum in ^last^es^mxdJJiS^r^^axv^^ at thus;-First year  47,000,Sec ond year    , w *,.. .... *      7 3,r 0O0 0Third year     t. *.....,      754 000c ^and that this would be off set &quot;by an addition of  5,500 if the non-Bur nham areas adopt the awardsThe Government Actuary has seen these calculations and sees no need to question them, but points out that the cost will tend to grow since the teachers are not of a large average age as yet.The effect of the Award on pensions - is slightly to increase them by reason of the increase of the maximaaIII.    TJCHNlGAIi.:  I, Tlie changes in the scales are identical with those in   I the Secondary Scales9;It is estimated that the number of teachers affected by the award       1,-653 in-areas where the Burnham scales arc opera-tive and that there are 204 of such teachers in areas where the scales are not at present operative;    and that the, application of 1 the new award to all these would result in a saving of  13,347I&quot;per annum of salary expenditure in the Burnham areas, off set by Ian increase of  8/433 in the non-Burnhamj being a net saving of   1I 4,914,,The pension changes are of the same general effect as are noted in the case of the Elementary award,IV* smciARY., -On the scales alone, as applied to the present number   I -of teachers, the saving, after allowing for all non-Burnham areas to come to the new standard, would be, in the first year:-&apos;. Elementary 150,000Secondary     ........ 414500Technical      ........ 4,900.196,400
end would reach in the fifth year:- .ITlementary    ......... 820,000Secondary     .........    71,500Technical     ..,.....,     5 .,000696,500.&quot;.JkxmexaS. to the three Awards are .certain reoomendations,. These recommendations are not part of the Award and we can reserve them for further consideration.     The only recommendation which would have a serious financial effect is No. (2) in each oase, which recommends the grant of special allowances for certain purposes in addition to the Scales awarded.     Lord Burnham has transmitted to the Board three Reports of the Joint Standing Committees which contain proposals for carrying out this Recorximendation.     It is only necessary at this moment to say here that the proposals contained in the Reports, if accepted &quot;by the Board and if carried out to the fullest extent by the Local Education Authorities Would involve an extra expenditure over and above the present expenditure on similar special allowances of a figure in the neighbourhood of  438,000 on -Elementary, Secondary, and Technical together,.     It is clear that a proposal of this magnitude must be very carefully considered and must indeed form the subject of negotiation with the representatives of the Local Authorities and the Teachers before any decision can be arrived at.Recommendation Noc (l) in each Award recommends the Board to adjust its grants in such a way that no Local Authority shall gain by paying a lower scale than that awarded^,     Eor the moment all that it is necessary to say in regard to this Recommendation is that we assume that as the Scales have been the subject of arbitration  the Award will be universally accepted and carried into effect and that we,  therefore, hope that the question of acting upon this Recommendation will not arise*
Add   (to page 6 of Award Public Elementary Schools, (to page 3 of Award Secondary Schools, (to paga 3 of Award Technical Schools.the following clause (iraoodiately following the clause headed &quot;Existing Teachers&quot;)Scale Salaries as existing on 31 March 1925, means *Salary on that date if correctly calculated according to the scale Yfhich was in force in tho Area on that date (?;hethor 95 per cent. Bumham or other scale not exceeding the full Burnham scale) and excluding allowances.     Allowances in addition to the new scales are to be dealt with as a separate mattor.

PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.The Standing Joint Committee on Scales of Salary for Teachers in Public Elementary Schools, representative of the County Councils Association, the Municipal Corporations Association, the Association of Education Committees and of the National Union of Teachers, was set up at the request of the President of the Board of Education &quot; to secure the orderly and progressive solution of the salary question in Public Elementary Schools on a national basis and its correlation with a solution of the salary problem in Secondary Schools&quot; on the 12th September, 1919.The Joint Committee unanimously adopted a Report establishing a Provisional Minimum Scale on the 21st November, .1919 and completed it in June, 1920 by a Supplementary Report upon the salaries of Teachers of Handicraft.The Joint Committee unanimously adopted a Report on Standard Scales of Salaries on the 30th September, 1920 and provided for a minimum duration of such Scales. In a further Report, dated the 25th April, 1921, the Joint Committee submitted to the President a Schedule containing an allocation of Standard. Scales to the educational areas of the country.During the two financial years March :jlst, 1922 to March 31st, 1924 a voluntary abatement of 5% on their salaries was made by the Teachers in response to the request of the Local Education Authorities. Last year, the question of settling by agreement the Scales of Salaries to be paid to Teachers in Public Elementary Schools after March 31st 1925 was under discussion at many meetings of the Joint Standing Committee. It was found impossible to arrive at any agreement on the subject and failing agreement, it was resolved unanimously by the Panels representing the Local Education Authorities and the National Union of Teachers to submit the questions in dispute to me as Arbitrator.The Terms of Submission to Arbitration accepted by the Local Education Authorities and the National Union of Teachers were as follows :1. That the Standing Joint Committee on Teachers&apos; Salaries (Elementary) having failed to agree as-to the continuance, adjustment or replacement of the salary scales which expire on the 31st March 1925 does hereby agree to refer to Lord Burnham, as Arbitrator, the claim of the Local Education Authorities&apos; Panel for a reduction of the figures of the Standard Scales of Salaries and tho claim of the Teachers&apos; Panel for the payment of the said scales in full as from the 1st April 1925.2. That the Arbitrator be empowered to fix a time limit (luring which the scales and the necessary accompanying conditions shall be operative.3. That Lord Eurnham be empowered, failing agreement, by the Panels over the allocation of tho scales for Elementary School Teachers, to determine the allocation before promulgating his Award.4. That the Arbitrator hear and consider such evidence, written and/or verbal, as the respective Panels may tender.o. That the respective Panels will bind themselves to accept tho findings of the Arbitrator and to urge upon the Local Education Authorities and Teachers tho adoption of the Arbitrator^ Award.G. The respective Panels agree on receipt of tho Arbitrators Award to make representations, if necessary, to the President of the Board of Education, with a view to obtaining the assistance of tho Board in securing the adoption of the Award by Local Education Authorities and Teachers.Under these terms I was not requested nor empowered to go beyond the form or figures of the Standard Scales. I have not, therefore, been able to attempt to simplify or reduce their number, inasmuch as that would have involved a different set of scales in the first place and a fresh allocation of such scales to the educational areas of England and Wales.On the matters submitted to me, I give my award as follows : The Scales shall be as follows : -

NOTES   ON   THE   SCALES.General.The first year of school service shall be called a Probationary Year and the first increment will accrue after two completed years of service.Increments are  12 for men Certificated Teachers,  9 for women Certificated Teachers,  7 10s. for men Uncertificated Teachers and  6 for Avomen Uncertificated Teachers.Certificated  Assistant  Teachers  (Men).The minimum and maximum salaries are slightly in advance of 95% of the full Burn ham Scale.C ertific ated   assistant   teachers    (women).The minimum salaries approximate to 95% of the full Burnham Scale.The maximum salaries approximate very closely to 95% of the full Burnham Scale.The minima are higher than four-fifths of the minima for men ; the increments are three-quarters of those for men ; and the maxima only differ by a very small fraction from four-fifths of those for men. As a result, a womans salary is usually higher than four-fifths of the mans salary at the corresponding year of service. Over the 44 years of a teacher&apos;s normal professional life, the womans aggregate salary is 81% to 82% of that of a man.Uncertificated Assistant  Teachers.The same principles have been applied to Uncertificated as to Certificated Assistants.Certificated Head Teachers.As in the case of Assistants, the maximum salaries are slightly in advance of 95 % of the full Burnham Scale.An attempt has been made to mitigate the objection, often expressed, to the present Burnham Scales that it is more, profitable for a teacher to remain as assistant in a town school than to become head of a Grade I country school.The maxima for women approximate to four-fifths of those for men.EXISTING   TEACHERS.No teacher shall receive by reason of the operation of the awarded scale, a less rate of salary as from the 1st April, 1925, than he or she was receiving on the 31st March, 1925, provided that no teacher shall receive a scale salary in excess of the maximum of the appropriate scale -i.e. existing teachers will mark time until the new scale overtakes their scale salaries as existing on the 31st March, 1925..DURATION   OF   SCALES.The duration of the scales shall be six years from March 31st, 1925, and there-after from year to year, subject to notice of one year, being the financial year, from either panel of the standing Joint Committee..    . i- &apos; f: :-RECOMMENDATIONS.I strongly recommend :(1) That the Board of Education shall so adjust the grant that no Local Education Authority shall gain financially by paying salaries on a basis lower than the appropriate standard scales.
(2) That the Board of Education should be asked to recognise for the cal-speculation of grant expenditure by each Local Education Authority within a prescribed sum, ascertained for the Authority on a well-defined basis, for the purposes outlined in paragraph 14 of the Eeport of the Standing Joint Committee of the 30th September, 1920, or for the purpose of meeting cases of special hardship arising out of educational reorganisation, provided that in the event of this recommendation being accepted by the Board no part of such sum shall be applied towards so increasing the salaries of classes, of teachers mentioned in the Report as would be tantamount to altering the operation of the Standard Scales.(3) That where under Section 6 (e) of the main Report of the Joint Committee recognised teachers of Handicraft have not been graded for salary purposes as Certificated Assistant Teachers not College-Trained, they should be so graded, having regard to the importance of Handicraft teaching in the schools.(4) That where Local Authorities have undertaken Housing Schemes teachers in the Public Elementary Schools should be given the opportunity of taking such houses or tenements for their own occupation at the stipulated rents where they would thus be enabled to reside in the neighbourhood of their schools.(5) In the course of the proceedings several questions were brought before me upon points of detail in the application of the existing Standard Scales which create special difficulties. I have not been able to deal with these questions in my Award, but I recommend that the Standing Joint Committee should consider questions of this kind with a view to making such readjustments as they may find to be necessary or desirable.ALLOCATION   OF SCALES.Whereas certain cases in dispute between the Panels as to allocation of scales to educational areas were submitted to me for determination, I give my award as follows :Norfolk to remain on Scale I. Dorsetshire to remain on Scale I. Wiltshire to remain on Scale I. Montgomeryshire to remain on Scale I. Hertfordshire to proceed from Scale II to Scale III. Hemel Hempstead to proceed from Scale II to Scale III. Kettering to proceed from Scale II to Scale III. Devonshire to recede from Scale II to Scale I. Hereford City to recede from Scale II to Scale I.

RECOMMENDATIONS.I strongly recommend. : (1) That the Board of Education shall so adjust the grant that no Local Education Authority shall gain financially by paying salaries on a basis lower than the appropriate standard scales.(2) That the Board of Education should be asked to recognise for the calculation of grant expenditure by each Local Education Authority within a prescribed sum, ascertained for the Authority on a well-defined basis, for the purposes outlined in paragraphs 4 (3) (a), (c), (d) ; 4 (4) (b), (c) and 13 (&amp;) of the Report of the Standing Joint Committee of the 28th April, 1921, provided that in the event of this recommendation being accepted by the Board no part of such sum shall be applied towards so increasing the salaries of classes of teachers mentioned in the Report as would be tantamount to altering the operation of the standard scales.(3) That all Local Education Authorities should formulate their own standard scales for all classes of teachers referred to in Section 10 of the Report of the Standing Joint Committee dated 28th April, 1921.(4) In the course of the proceedings several questions were brought before me upon points of detail in the application of the existing Standard Scales which create special difficulties. I have not been able to deal with these questions in my award, but I recommend that the Standing Joint Committee should consider questions of this kind with a view to making such readjustments as they may find to be necessary or desirable.
