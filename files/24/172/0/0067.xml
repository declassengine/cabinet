BRET1.167(85)S-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. NORTHERN IRELAND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND. Suggested Assistance from Great Britain. MEMORANDUM     BY     THE     MINISTER      OF     LABOUR.1.     The Cabinet on February 18th agreed (Cabinet 9/25) that thequestion of the Northern Ireland Unemployment Insurance Fund shouldbe discussed between the Minister of Labour and the Chanoellor ofthe Exchequer, in consultation, if necessary, with the Governmentof Northern Ireland, and that the two Ministers should advise theCabinet as to the most suitable oourse of aotion.8.     This morning Lord Londonderry oame to see me - I understandat the instance of the Chancellor of the Exohequer, whom he had seenpreviously.   Lord   Londonderry referred to the fact that in theEleotion Manifesto issued by Sir James Craig on Saturday lastreference is made to this question.     Aocording to the &quot;Times&quot;report, Sir James Craig made the following deolaratlon:-wIt must not be forgotten that when the Boundary crisis is surmounted there are still outstanding problems of supreme importance for settlement between the British Government and ourselves -our future financial arrangements......  there-amalgamation of the unemployment fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland......&quot;3.     Following upon the Cabinet decision of February last, I prepared and sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer a memorandum, copy of whioh I annex to this note,    in this memorandum I put forward for consideration a scheme of loans to Northern Ireland to cover 75 per cent,  of the deficit on their Fund, including both the present deficit and future deficits.The Chanoellor informs me that he is not in favour of my suggestion, but that in his opinion the proper course is &quot;to amalgamate the funds on the ground that the whole principle of Unemployment insurance depends upon a sufficiently large area and large numbers of trades being covered&quot;,
4.        In the paper that I circulated to the Cabinet on the 28th January (C.P.57/24), I pointed oat the difficulties inherent in any scheme of amalgamation of the two Funds, and I need not now go over the whole ground again.Amalgamation of the two Funds really means a complete reversion to the position prior to the Government of Ireland Act, the Ministry of Labour here being responsible for Northern Ireland exactly In the same way that we are responsible for Scotland,     The obvious objection to this (apart from the political issues that would be raised by such a departure from the principle of the Government of Ireland) is that we should be involved in all the ordinary diffi-culties attendant upon the granting or withholding of unemployment benefit to individuals with the additional complication that those individuals would flid means of raising their grievances in the northern Ireland Parliament, the Members of which would be in the nappy position of being able to syspathise with their constituents without having the check necessarily imposed upon all of us by responsibility.I mention only to dismiss what may seem a possible alternative viz;    to amalgamate the schemes, but to let the Northern Ireland Government be responsible for administration Uo far as Northern Ireland is concerned.     The objections to this have already been argued, and I need only add that It has proved impossiblefor me up to the present to devise any workable scheme of check upon the Northern Ireland Administration of a kind which could be defended in the House of Commons.5.        I understand from Lord Londonderry that what is now in mind is a scheme of amalgamation of the two Funds, leaving the two administrations separate, but keeping the accounts of the Fund in two parts, each part showing its own profit or loss.   The
ii 3 3The two Governments would be responsible for the interest on any outstanding debt in the proportions agreed upon at the time of the separation, i.ee  on the basis of the insured population of the two coijntries.    This would mean that Northern Ireland would be responsible for approximately one-fiftieth of the interest on the combined debt.   At present, Northern &quot;Ireland is responsible for the whole of the interest on its own debt (about  2,500, 000) ,    Our own debt is about  6,000,000,  so that   applying the scheme to the present position we should become responsible for forty-nine fiftieths of the interest on  2,500,000 (say  122,500 per annum), while Northern Ireland, while escaping this sum, would become responsible for one-fiftieth of the interest on  6,000,000 (say, ( 6,000 per annum),Of course the position would become different in degree as and when unemployment improves, and if unemployment improved faster in Northern Ireland than in this country, the relative positions would be altered.    On the other hand,  if unemployment remains worse in Northern Ireland than it is in this country the British liability would be of an increasing amount.It seems to me that this proposal involves a &quot;concealed&quot; subsidy, which in fact, of course, could not be concealed and which would be attacked with considerable force both from trie Labour and the Liberal benches.    In fact the proposal is only a variant of amalgamation coupled with separate administration here and in Northern Ireland and this, as I have already said,  I cannot see how to defend,7. In their decision of February 18th the Cabinet agreed thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and I should, if necessary,consult with the Government of Northern Ireland,    It seems to me that it would be fruitless fa- us to invite Sir James Oraig and Mr,Andrews to come over  ere to talk to us until the question of principle has been decided.      I suggest therefore that the Cabinet should .
o oisider the question in the light of the memoranda that have already been circulated and should reach, a decision.(Intd.) A.S-M,17th March 1925.
*&quot;* r rNORTHERN IRELAND UNEMPLOYMENT FUND.The administrative and political difficulties in the way of any amalgamation of the Unemployment Funds of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of any financial assistance being given by the former to the latter, are detailed in memorandum C.P.37 (25). Moreover, the British Fund is not in a position to grant any financial assistanoej    it is at present in deficiency to the extent of over  7,000,000 and is increasing its debts substantially week by week.This memorandum therefore proceeds on the assumption that if financial assistance is to be given to the Northern Ireland Fund, it will have to be provided by the British Exchequer.The general basis suggested for consideration is that the financial assistance should be by way of loan without interest, repayable in priority to any other capital charges (e.g., a debt to the Northern Ireland Treasury) as and when the Northern Ireland Fund has a surplus over a year&apos;s working.While a definite understanding on the terms and limits of assistance should be reached with the Northern Ireland Government, it is important that any arrangement entered into should not be such as to entitle that Government to make a claim to any particular amount of assistance as a matter of right.    The British Treasury should retain unfettered the power of deciding any points that may arise but always of course within the limits of an honourable understanding.It would apparently be necessary,  if the assistance is to be effective,  that the loan should cover the whole of the sum by which the understanding debt of the Northern Ireland Fund exceeds what would be the Northern Ireland share of the combined debts of the two Funds, if this total were divided in proportion to the insured populations of the two countries,, but excludingj-(a) the sum of about  /:-&apos;/V.,0GG already given to the Northern Ireland Treasury under this head,    and(b) any sums included in the debt on account of interest.
The amount on this basis would be about  8,000,000* equivalent to  100,000 a year at 5$ interest.It may be necessary to go further and arrange to cover over a period of say 3 or 5 years some part of future defioits of the Northern Ireland Fund;    in order to leave Northern Ireland with an incentive to economy the whole of suoh defioits obviously should not be oovered.    The amount of assistance suggested for considera-tion on this basis is:-(i)     75$ of the excess of Northern Ireland Benefit over(ii)     75$ of the actual Northern Ireland deficit (excluding interest on advances), whichever is the less.The proportion 3.1$ is taken as that of the insured populations of the two countries.It is for consideration whether it should be made a condition that the Northern Ireland Treasury should not charge interest on any loan advanced by it to the Northern Ireland Fund;    such a condition seems reasonable.If the financial assistance is to oover any part of future deficits,  this should be subject to the conditions thatJ-2.1$ of the combined Benefit of the two countries OR(a)the Northern Ireland Acts must be identioal with those of Great Britain and their regulations, instructions etc, must be at least as stringent as their operation in Great Britain;    further, that any deviation from British practice must be subject to the prior approval of the British Treasury?00the British Treasury must have the right to obtain any information they desire, by inspection or otherwise, with regard to the working of the Northern Ireland scheme(o)the Northern Ireland contributions must not be reduced below their present figures so long as any part of the debt to the British Treasury remains unpaid;It is for consideration, also, whether there should not be some increase in the present rates of contribution in Northern Ireland.
