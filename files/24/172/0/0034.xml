PRIORITY. SECRET.iRAffT TELEGRAM.                 FOLLOWING FliOM PRBtfe MINISTER FOR --------  YoW - ^li^^XsTER.jvernor General Ottawa Melbourne Wellington Capetown DublinPRESIDENT OP EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.&apos; .:     &apos; v. -       &apos; . - &apos; &apos;       . -Begins.   My message of yesterday.    Rejection pf Geneva Protocol still leaves unsolved the vitally Import.ant problem of European security for the sake of which the Protocol&apos; was devised.    The solution of that problem is a matter of interest not only to Europe itself but to the wholejovernorSt.John*&apos;s   world and not least to the British Empira.    The present Newfoundland. &quot;state of unrest, suspicion, and apprehension in europe is not merely prejudicial to a trade recovery in which we are all interested and to any prospect of a reduction of armaments to which we all look forward, but contains within itself the seeds of grave danger to the future peace of the world.   Any contribution therefore w&amp;i ich we can make towards establishing security in Europe will-be a contribution to our own immediate well-being and to our future insurance against the inevitable danger of complications arising from a. new conflict In Europe.2.    In considering what it is possible for us to do to promote the desired end we have however to make certain that we do not involve ourselves in obligations and commitments of a vague and undefined character or of such an extent as to increase rather than to limit the possibility of our being drawn into conflicts which do not really concern us.    It is from this point of view that we have felt it impossible to accept the Geneva Protocol, and the same objection would apply to any general proposal for guaranteeing the present frontiers of Europe which went beyond the obiigatidns
which we have already accepted in the Covenant of the League of Nations.3.   The only kind of obligation which we oould In fact undertake would be one which wou&amp;d coincide with 8 pre-existing and permanent Imperial interest, the undertaking of which would only make explioit and more effective a policy to which in the nature of things we were already committed.    The freedom of the narrow seas as a condition both of the security of this country and of the wider freedom of action of the Navy, upon which the security of the whole Empire rests, is suoh a permanent interest, and in pursuance of it we have for centuries resisted every attempt by any aggressive continental power, whether Spain, Frames or Germany, to dominate the whole of the ports opposite the South and South-Eastern coast of this island.    It was the realisation of this which led to the united action of the whole of the Empire in resisting the German invasion of Belgium. But the experience of that struggle and the development of modern communications, and more particularly of air warfare, tend to the oenolusion that our historio policy, our &quot;Monroe doctrine&quot;, can only be effective if it seoures not only the Belgian but also the Franco-German frontiers.    It was frcm that point of view that we were prepared, if the United States had oo-operated, to guarantee the frontiers of France and Belgium in 1919, and that Mr. Lloyd &amp;esrrgele Government made offers to-France for a similar guarantee by this country alone in 1922.
4.       The possibility of giving such a guarantee, as an alternative to the security offered by the Protocol, and an alternative much more acceptable to France and Belgium and therefore calculated to improve their whole attitude towards Germany, has naturally been present to the mind of the Cabinet. But we have felt no little hesitation at the idee of shoulder-ing so serious a commitment without clearer evidence that on either the French or the German side there was a real desire to live in peace and to ensure the stability of their common frontier.5.       In the course of the last few days, however, the German Government has repeated to Paris, Brussels and Home a proposal first put to us in great confidence a couple of weeks ago to the effeot that Germany would be willing to enter   into a pact with these Powers to guarantee the existing boundary line between Germany on the one side and France and Belgium on the other.     Present indications tend to show that France and Belgium are   beginning to realise how materially the general peace of Europe.could be fortified, and their own security enhanced, if they could enter into a formal and neutral pact with Germany for maintaining their common frontier inviolable against aggression from any quarter,     !i;he suggestion appears also to meet with favour in Rome.    It is too early to speak positively, but the Information which has reached us in the last few days encourages the belief that the opportunityN for the conclusion of such a mutual pact is exceptionally favourable and that a prospect of its confirmation and endorse-ment by us would ensure its being seriously taken up on both sides.6.       We feel very strongly that this favourable opportunity should not be allowed to pass, with -thepossibility of fresh disturbing factors arising , without, some effort on our part to help things forward.     3dr.Chamberlain will be seeing -M.Herriot in Paris on Friday on his way to Geneva.    Our view
is that -without committing himself or the British Government, to any definite scheme.,,  still less doing or saying anything which would in any way engage the responsibility of Dominion Governments or Parliament^, he should intimate to M.Harriot our point of view on the following general linesi-(1)     that His Majesty^ Government do not feel able to enter into any one-sided pact to guarantee the frontiers of France and Belgium against Germany;(2)     that the question of a general agreement between France Belgium and Germany with the help of Great Britain for mutual security and for guaranteeing each others&apos; frontiers in the West of JJiurope, stands on a different footings(3)     that if the French Government share our views and will regulate their attitude towards Germany accordingly, the question of the participation by His Majesty&apos;s Government in such a general agreement would be seriously considered by us in the hope that with our help the German proposal might be made the basis of an agreement which will give a real and lasting guarantee to the peace of Europe, but that, before we could commit ourselves to any decision in a matter of such great moment, we should feel bound to enter into full consultation with the Governments of the Dominion^ and Indiac7*    . you will realise that the Foreign Secretary in dealing with the French and other Governments on these vital and urgent matters cannot avoid taking some definite line, evenif it is only tentatively.    The line indicated above is thehereone which I and my colleagues/regard as the most promising from the point of view of Jiuropean security and peace and as the safest from the point of view of the extent of our commitments and of the probability of our ever having to implement them.&apos; BALDY.aU.    &amp;HDS,
