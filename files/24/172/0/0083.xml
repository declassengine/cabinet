REPORTToThe Eight Honourable the Viscount Cave, G.C.M.G., Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.My Lord,We now beg to submit our Report upon the matters referred to us for enquiry.1. We have held 24 sittings. The witnesses whose names and descriptions are set out in Appendix I have appeared before us and given evidence. Our sittings have been interrupted twice for short periods owing to the general elections which took place in December, 1923, and October, 1924.2. The difficulties which have arisen in the working of the Poor Persons&apos; Rules have been caused solely by reason of the inability of the Poor Persons&apos; Department to find an adequate number of solicitors willing to undertake the conduct of the large number of divorce cases brought by and against poor persons. This inability is not due to any lack of effort on the part of the Law Society or of the Poor Persons&apos; Department. On the contrary we desire here to record oar appreciation of the work that has already been done by a large number of solicitors in dealing with poor persons&apos; cases. This work has been done under circumstances of great difficulty. It has involved a certain amount of personal expense to the solicitors and a considerable amount of disorganisation of the ordinary work of their offices for which they have received no remuneration and little recognition.3. There has been no difficulty in finding a sufficient number of barristers to undertake the necessary Court work under the present system, and there is no likelihood of any shortage of barristers willing to give gratuitous service arising in the future I so long as solicitors also render gratuitous services. We there-fore do not propose to refer again to the Bar, and in using the term &quot; the profession &quot; in this Report we desire it to be under-stood that we mean the solicitors&apos; branch of the legal profession only. We wish to add that no unfavourable inference should be drawn as between the two branches of the profession by reason of the facts stated in this paragraph, as the work of barristers in connection with poor persons&apos; cases is necessarily much less irksome and troublesome than that undertaken by solicitors.4. We have in Appendix II set out in tabular form the statistics relating to poor persons&apos; cases. Although these statistics show an increase in the number of cases of all kinds,
yet the cases other than matrimonial causes are still com-paratively few and no difficulty has arisen in dealing with them under the present system. As regards matrimonial causes, how-ever, the ease is different. The exceptional number of applica-tions in divorce proceedings arising out of the war may now fairly be considered as having been exhausted. It is reasonable, there-fore, to anticipate that there will be no reduction in the number of applications in the future. An average taken over the years 1922, 1923 and 1924, gives the following result for one yea.r viz. : 2,270 applications in respect of each of which a reporter has to be found, and1,041 cases in which a favourable report has been made and in respect of each of which a conducting solicitor and a barrister have to be found.We are of opinion that these figures fairly represent the minimum number of divorce applications and divorce cases which will have to be dealt with in each year for the future. Roughly two-thirds of the work comes from the country and oue-third from.. London.5. On the 31st December, 1924, there were in the Poor Persons&apos; Department 412 divorce applications in which favourable reports had been made for which no conducting solicitors could be found. There is no need for us to point out the seriousness of the position which has thus arisen.6. The weak spot in the present system is that its success depends entirely upon the individual efforts of a comparatively few members of the profession, and further that the organisation and distribution of the necessary work are not undertaken by the profession in its collective capacity but are in the hands of officials who are necessarily not in such close touch with solicitors as the representative bodies of the profession would be if the organisation and distribution were undertaken by such bodies. The evidence adduced before us shows that the reluctance evinced by the majority of the members of the profession to undertake the conduct of poor persons&apos; divorce cases under the present system is attributable to the following three main causes, viz. : (1) the distasteful character of the work,(2) the difficulty and delay in obtaining payment of out-of-pocket expenses out of the deposits in Court, and(3) the undue burden cast upon London solicitors owing to the centralisation of divorce work in London.The real problem which has confronted us on the present enquiry is to discover some practical method of avoiding these difficulties for the future.
7. First: The distasteful character of the -work. This, is inherent in the nature of the work itself arid is rendered more acute by reason of the fact that the persons concerned are often uneducated and ignorant. Many solicitors, for various reasons, object to undertaking divorce work of any kind. Others, who have no such general objection, do not like to receive at their offices persons who are often ill-dressed and frequently ill-mannered. The provision of a room or rooms at the Law Courts or at some other place where solicitors could interview the parties and their witnesses would, to some extent, meet this objection, but it would entail loss of time and extra trouble and thus make the work more burdensome. In any event, the provision of such accommodation would not remove the main cause of the difficulty now under consideration. It is obvious that no mere Rules of Court, however framed, would overcome the reluctance on the part of solicitors caused by the distasteful character of the work.8. Secondly : The delay awl difficulty in obtaining payment of out-of-pocket expenses out of the deposits in. Court. The cam-plaints on this score have been numerous and in the main well-founded. In our opinion, the regulations now in force have the. effect of deterring solicitors from Undertaking the work. The difficulty and delay are aggravated by the large number of cases which have to be dealt with in the Registry. But this cause, although it has contributed substantially to the breakdown of the-present system, does not really go to the root of the difficulty, and if removed, would not, in our opinion, bring about the success of that system.9. Thirdly : The undue burden cast upon London Solicitors owing to the centralisation of the divorce work in London. -In July, 1922, for the first time, provision was made for the trial of poor persons&apos; divorce cases a.t the ten Assize towns mentioned in, Order 36a, Rule 8. This, in addition to affording substantial relief to poor persons, also to some extent relieves 1 jonrion solicitors of their burden. As, however, at present all divorce cases have to be commenced and all interlocutory applications have to be dealt with in London, the relief afforded to London solicitors is comparatively trifling. In conducting divorce pro1-ceedings every country solicitor has still to^ employ a London agent, and thus London solicitors have practically to bear the burden of conducting poor persons&apos; divorce cases for the whole of England and Wales, even though two-thirds, of such cases come from the country. It is generally recognised that this-is unfair to London solicitors and it is not to be wondered th,at there exists a strong and insistent demand for a more equitable distribution of the work. One remedy, which has been much stressed by a large number of solicitors of the highest standing, both in London and the country and has been advocated by tlie-
Law Society and by some of the most influential Provincial Law Societies, is that jurisdiction in divorce should be conferred upon the County Courts. We do not, however, on the present occasion propose to go into the merits or demerits of this vexed question for the simple reason that such a remedy would involve legislation of a highly contentious nature, and that it is at least doubtful whether any Bill conferring such jurisdiction would be passed. Moreover, considerable time would inevitably elapse before the result of an attempt to obtain the passing of the necessary Bill conferring such jurisdiction could be ascertained, whilst it is obvious -that the deadlock which has now arisen requires to be dealt with as promptly as possible. The alternative remedy is -tb&quot;confer the appropriate powers enabling divorce cases to be commenced and prosecuted in District Registries and to provide additional facilities for the trial of poor persons&apos; divorce cases at Assizes! In our opinion, however, such a decentralisation of the divorce work would not of itself bring about the success of the present system.10. The definite conclusion reached by us after a careful consideration of all the circumstances is that the present system cannot be made a success merely by amending the Rules and by further decentralising the divorce work (though, as will be seen, we regard further decentralisation as essential to the &apos;success of any scheme),-because such measures would only go part of the way towards meeting the real cause of the present failure. In our opinion, therefore, it is necessary that some different system should be substituted for the present system, and we&quot; ha-ve directed our efforts towards finding the right system to be adopted for the future.&apos;U. AH systems for affording legal assistance to poor persons can be grouped under two main heads, namely, systems in which the State itself renders the necessary legal services and systems in which such services are rendered by the profession.12. If the State were to undertake such legal services it would be necessary to set up a new Government Department or, at the least, greatly to expand and reorganise the Poor Persons&apos; Depart-:ment, and to appoint a staff of qualified officials to perform the duties of the reporting and conducting solicitors. It is no doubt a proper function of the Government to ensure that meritorious poor persons are not deprived of access to the High Court by lack of means, but the assumption by the Government of the duty -of giving advice to and conducting litigation for private persons directly is. open to many objections. In the first place it must be exceedingly costly. Secondly, it involves the loss of much voluntary energy which is at present available. In the third place the giving of legal advice to and the conduct of legal pro-
ceedings for another under a voluntary system places the legal ao-ent under a direct personal responsibility to the lay client who is dependent upon the skill and honesty of his agent, and the relationship must involve complete trust on the one side and complete independence of judgment on the other. This relation-ship, which is essential for the maintenance of honesty and skill will, with difficulty, survive the substitution of such an organi-sation as a Government Office for the individual solicitor and counsel. This Objection does not depend upon any theoretical dislike to State intervention but upon the peculiar nature of the tie between solicitor and client.If the scheme proposed in this Report should fail to prove effective it is difficult to see what alternative would then be available except the institution of a State Department, however objectionable on other grounds such a measure may be, and in that event the question of the institution of a. State system will require further consideration. We concur in the views expressed on this subject in the Report of the. Committee appointed to enquire into the Poor Persons&apos; Rules in the year 1919, and would only add that, in our opinion, there exists a moral obligation on the part of the profession, in return for the monopoly in the practice of the law which it enjoys, to render gratuitous legal assistance to those members of the community who cannot afford to pay for such assistance, provided that no undue burden is thereby cast upon any individual members of the profession. The evidence given before us shows that this moral obligation is fully recognised by the bulk of the profession in this country (as indeed it is in most other civilised countries), and that the profession is prepared to discharge it, subject to suitable and equitable arrangements being made for that purpose. Until a fair opportunity has been given to the profession to undertake the duty of rendering legal assistance to poor persons, and until the profession has failed to avail itself of such opportunity the State ought not to be asked to undertake this duty itself. We have therefore refrained from considering the details of any scheme based on the State rendering legal assistance to poor persons.13. Systems falling within the second group may be sub-divided into two classes, namely : (a) where the legal services rendered by the profession! to poor persons are paid for, and(6) where such legal services are gratuitous.14. The adoption of any system falling within the first of these two classes would necessitate the provision of funds not only for the expenses of organisation and administration but also for the payment of the necessary remuneration of the solicitors employed. Such funds would have to be provided either by the Government,
or by voluntary subscriptions, or by a compulsory levy on the whole legal profession, aided possibly, by the money which the poor persons might be able to contribute, or by a combination of some or all of these means. The establishment and maintenance of any system on these lines present many difficulties, both practical and otherwise, and should not in our opinion be attempted so long as a workable system based on gratuitous service can be discovered. In view of the conclusion to which we have arrived, as hereinafter stated, we have not entered into the consideration of the details of any such system.15. Eliminating systems based upon the State rendering legal services and systems based on payment for legal services rendered by the profession, there remain systems based on gratuitous legal services rendered by the profession. Any such system in order-to be successful must have the good-will of the profession. The-present system is no doubt one which falls within the class now under consideration, but, as before stated, one of its main weak-nessess, in our opinion, is that its organisation and administration are in official hands and not in the hands of the profession upon which falls the burden of carrying it into effect. If gratuitous service is to be rendered, it is, of course, unreasonable to suggest that the profession should, in addition, bear the whole burden of providing the expenses necessary for the proper organisation and administration of the system. Hitherto the State has freed poor persons from all Court fees and has provided and staffed the Poor Persons&apos; Department a? considerable expense, and we have reason to believe that the Governmentl would continue to give reasonable financial aid to any practical system based on gratuitous service. Moreover, the evidence has clearly demonstrated that there exists sufficient goodwill and sympathy in the profession to ensure the successful working of any well-considered scheme based on gratuitous service.16. Our investigations further tended to .show that the profession would not favourably regard any such system unless the following three essential conditions were complied with,, viz. : (1) the divorce work to be further substantially decentralised, (2) the organisation and administration of the work to beentrusted to the profession instead of being in thehands of officials, and (3) a reasonable annual grant in aid of the expenses of administration to be made by the Government.17. As regards the first of these conditions, it was clearly brought home to us that (on the assumption that no jurisdiction in divorce would be conferred upon the County Courts) the minimum decentralisation which would meet with the acceptance
of the profession, was that poor persons&apos; divorce cases should be capable of being commenced and prosecuted in as many District &quot;Registries of the High Court and of being tried at as many Assize Towns as reasonably possible.Country solicitors attach considerable importance to the point that the divorce business should be conducted in the District Registries of the High Court and not in the District Probate Registries. The reasons for this preference are that the District High Court Registrars are accustomed as an ordinary matter of routine to deal with contentious interlocutory applications, such as would necessarily occur in divorce proceedings, and that such applications would be altogether foreign to the duties ordinarily performed by the District Probate Registrars which are confined to non-contentious work. We have carefully considered this point and are of opinion that the reasons SO&apos; advanced are well-founded and ought to be accepted if the good-will of the country solicitors is to be secured.18. As it apj)eared to us that no insuperable difficulties existed in formulating a practical scheme which would embody the three conditions above indicated and which would also solve the problem confronting us, we considered it advisable before going further into details to ascertain whether we were right in the impression we had formed that the principles upon which such a scheme would be founded would meet with the approval of the profession as a whole. With this object in view Sir Roger Gregory and Mr. A. H. Coley at our request undertook the task of bringing the outline of such a scheme before the Law Society and the Provincial Law Societies, with the result that the Law Society and 49 out of 81 Provincial Law Societies were wholly in favour of the principles underlying such a scheme; 24 Provincial Law Societies were neutral or expressed no opinion, and only 8 Provincial Law Societies expressed an adverse view. As regards the latter, however, we have every reason to hope that if the scheme which we recommend were adopted they would assist the rest of the profession in carrying it into effect. If not we believe that the Law Society could arrange for the areas which they cover.19. Having thus ascertained that a scheme on the lines above indicated would meet with the approval of the bulk of the profession, subject to details being satisfactorily arranged, we proceeded to consider the best method of carrying such a scheme into effect, having special regard to the views expressed by the bodies officially representing the profession.20. In the result, after considering the whole matter in all its bearings, we have formulated and recommend for acceptance the following
Scheme.(1) The work in connection with poor persons&apos; matrimonial causes to be further decentralised by(a) enabling such matrimonial causes to be commenced andprosecuted in the District High Court Registries at the following places : Birkenhead. Lewes.Birmingham. Liverpool.Bristol. Manchester.Cardiff. Newcastle.Carlisle. Norwich.Derby. Nottingham.Durham. Portsmouth.Exeter-. Southampton.Ipswich. Swansea.Leeds. York. Leicester.(b) enabling such matrimonial causes to be tried at thefollowing Assize towns : Bristol. Leicester.Carlisle. Lewes.Derby. Winchester.Durham. York.in addition to the following at which poor persons&apos; divorce cases are now tried under Order 36a, Rule 8 :-Birmingham. Nottingham.Cardiff (or Swan- Norwich.sea   when  the Newcastle.Glamorgan As- Manchester.sizes are held at Liverpool.Swansea). Exeter.Chester. Leeds.(2) (a) The Poor Persons&apos; Department to be abolished and all work in connection with poor persons&apos; applications and cases to be taken over by the profession as a whole free from any official control.(b) The work to be done under the supervision of the Law Society and Provincial Law Societies by Committees to be appointed by those Societies and approved by the Lord Chancellor.(c) The Committees to have power to grant certificates entitling the grantees to be admitted to take defend! or be parties to any legal proceedings in the High Court as poor persons.
(d) The Committees to nominate the conducting solicitors and to exercise a general supervision over the conduct of the proceed-ings, the following fundamental conditions being observed,, viz. : (i) the test as to means to remain the same as under the,present Rules unless and until altered by Rules of&apos; Court,(ii) no money to be demanded or received for profit costsor office expenses unless sanctioned by the Court or by the Rules of Court for the time being in force, and,(iii) no higher deposit for out-of-pocket expenses to be required from any poor person than may be sanctioned, from time to time by Rules of Court.(3) A granlt of not less than  3,000 per annum to be made by the Government in- aid of administration expenses; such grant to be paid to the Law Society and to be appropriated by that Society in su^b a manner as may be considered best in the interests of the Scheme as a whole.21. To ensure the successful conduct of the interloctury work by the District High Court Registrars, it is most desirable that there should be close contact between them and the Judges of the Probate Division, and that the authority of the President over the general conduct of business should be as effective in the District Regis-tries as in the Principal Registry. In particular, the power of the Court to dispense with naming a co-respondent or a woman with whom a husband is charged with adultery and to dispense with service or to authorise substituted service requires for its judicious exercise special skill and experience. We recommend that where an application for any of these purposes is made in a District Registry, the papers (including the affidavits in support of the application) should be forwarded by the District Registrar to the Senior Registrar of the Probate Division, and that he should, unless in his opinion the nature of the case, as disclosed upon, the papers, requires a hearing before the Judge, himself grant or refuse the application and indicate his decision in writing to the District Registrar.Power should, however, be reserved to the Lord Chancellor and the President acting together from time to time to dispense with this requirement in the case of any particular District Registry.22. We have in Appendix III set out the administrative, details of the Scheme but in our opinion it is undesirable that such details should be embodied in Rules of Court. The manner of operating the Scheme should be left in the hands of the pro-fession, subject to compliance with the fundamental conditions as above-set out, which alone should be embodied in the Rules.. The details entered in this Appendix are such as, in our opinion,, may well be adopted by the profession until experience dictates some better method of operation.
;&apos;- 23. In order to carry into effect paragraph (1) of the Scheme it- will be necessary for the Rule Committee to pass Rules to the effect set out in Part I of Appendix IV, and in order to carry into effect paragraph (2) of the Scheme it will be necessary for the Rule Committee to pass Rules to the effect set out in Part II of Appendix IV.2J4. If the Scheme be adopted ,tliesre will necessarily be a transition stage in respect of which we recommend that the following arrangements should be made : (1) a day to be appointed in consultation with the Law-Society for the coming into operation of the Scheme; (2; the appointed day to be published with an intimation that on and after that day no further applications should be made to the Poor Persons&apos; Department except in pending cases;(3) no fresh applications to be accepted by the Poor Persons&apos; Department on or after the appointed day, and any applications arriving on or after that day to be retained to the applicants with an intimation that they should apply to the appropriate Law Society ;(4) all applications received before the appointed day and not already sent to a reporter to be haaided over to the Law Society, together with the deposit (if any);(5) all other applications arid cases pending on the appointed day to be worked out under the present Rules, which should be kept alive for that purpose only.25. Our recommendation in favour of the adoption of the Scheme is based on the following (amongst other) reasons :  (1) because the Scheme is one which ha.s in principle the general approval of the majority of the Law Societies officially representing the profession and therefore should have every prospect of success,(2) because the Scheme involves the transfer of the organisation of the work from official hands to the hands of the profession, thus substituting organised legal aid for individual legal aid and making for greater responsibility whilst permitting of greater freedom of action,(3) because under the Scheme solicitors will be much n ore ready to undertake divorce cases than under the present system as the request to do so will come, not from a paid official, but from members of their own profession who are themselves bearing their full share of the burden,(4) because under the Scheme the work will be more evenly distributed and no members or class of members of the profession will be called upon to bear an undue share of the work,
1(5) because under the Scheme the Committee will be able to obtain the assistance of local legal aid and welfare societies, Charity Organisation Societies and similar bodies, and will thus be enabled to come to a much better conclusion as to the means and merits of the poor persons than a reporter under the present system, and(6) because the Scheme solves the problem which has confronted us, and we have been unable to discover any better scheme.26. In conclusion we desire to acknowledge the services of our Secretary, whose zeal and industry have been of the greatest assistance.We are, my Lord,Your obedient Servants,(Sgd.)      P.

Every Law Society shordd appoint a Committee to undertake the con-trol of poor persons&apos; cases, and should triennially in general meetino-elect a number of solicitors to serve on the Committee. The number elected should be not Jess than seven or more than 13, three to form a quorum.; but the number, no doubt, would vary with local conditions. The persons elected should hold office for a period of (say) three years, so as to secure continuity of administration. Provision should be made for&apos;supplying vacancies. The Committee should be given power to co-opt two or three persons, not being solicitors, such as persons repre-senting charitable organisations or institutions for the promotion of social welfare. All the nominations should be submitted to and approved by the Lord Chancellor. In cases where it is impracticable to obtain an honorary secretary the Committee should have power to appoint a clerk and pay him a small honorarium. Probably the librarian or clerk to the Law Society (where there is such anoffieial), would be willing to act and do the work in his spare time. The Committee should have the duty of inquiring into the application of a party to be admitted as a poor person, having regard to tho requirements expressed in Rules of Court, and, if satisfied, of signing a certificate entitling such persons to take or defend or be a party to proceedings in the High Court as a poor person.A short form of application by a poor person should be provided con-taining spaces for name and age, .whether married or single, and, if married, the numlber of children, the present or last place of employment, and the average wages earned. The applicant should also state whether or not he has previously consulted a solicitor as to the subject matter of his application, and, if so, with what result. The name or names of a person or persons, to whom, if necessary, reference could be made, should be given. This form, in the first instance, should be sent to the honorary secretary, or clerk of the Committee (hereinafter referred to as the clerk), who should after examining it, send for the applicant for a personal interview. Unless the facts disclosed showed clearly that there was no reasonable ground for the application, the clerk should then make an appointment for the applicant to see the Committee. The Com-mittee at its meeting should make a careful investigation into the cir-cumstances, and have power to administer an oath or require a statutory declaration in writing.If the Committee are satisfied as to the applicants poverty, he should then be questioned as to the nature and grounds of his claim and should be required to produce any documents in support of it. In the notice to him to attend the Committee an intimation that he would be required to produce all relevant documents should be given. If the Committee are satisfied as to the applicants want of means and that he has a prima facie case, the Committee should issue to him a certificate, entitling him to be admitted as a poor person for which purpose a short printed form of certificate should be used. Rules of Court should fix the maximum amount of deposit which the Committee might require any applicant to make at the sum of  5 and, in special circumstances, the further sum of  5. Deposits when required should be paid to the clerk who should keep a separate banking account.It is desirable that all forms used should be as simple as possible.Each Committee should nominate a number of solicitors willing to act who would form a panel of &quot;conducting solicitors.&quot; The number of the panel might be based upon the number of members of the Law Society; but again, local conditions would be the determining factor in this respect. The members constituting the panel should serve for, say, three years or possibly less. The Committee should nominate ;a conducting solicitor from the panel, regard being had to his special qualifications for tbe particular case, and allowance being made for the fact that he had already conducted a number of cases, or had cases in hand at the time. It should be recognised as an honourable obligation on the part of the
solicitor nominated to undertake the case and see it through. The Com-mittee should have and exercise a discretionary power as to what, if any, part of the deposit should be paid out for out-of-pocket expenses during the progress of the action. Any sum paid out should be paid on the simple receipt of the solicitor receiving the amount, stating the nature of the disbursement, and he should be required to give an account of his receipts and disbursements. The Committee should have power from time to time to call for a report from the conducting solicitor on each case, and it should itself keep records from which classified lists of the cases dealt with by the Committee, and other statistical information would be corn-piled so as to be available for official purposes. The Committee should have power to recommend to the Court at any time that a certificate should be cancelled and as regards the solicitor that he should be relieved of the case and another solicitor appointed in his place.The Bar Council and the Circuits should supply to the Law Society lists of counsel willing to assist poor persons.If possible a room at the local Courts, or in some other public building, should be reserved for the business of the Committee&apos;. Notice of the appointment of the Committee and of the dates fixed for their sittings should be displayed in. the local Courts, and in the Town Hall or principal local building. A leaflet stating shortly the powers of the Committee should be obtainable at the same places. The business of the Committee should, wherever possible, be transacted in the evening. The Committee should sit at fixed times, or, alternatively, a meeting should be called, when there were, say, two or -three applications ready to be considered.Importance is attached to the meetings of the Committee being held, in a room set apart for the purpose. If this were done, one difficulty,, which has been experienced incident to the intended litigant attending in the first instance at the solicitors office, would be avoided. In fact, if such a place could be obtained for all the business connected with these cases, including the conduct of them, it would be a great advantage. It is thought that, at any rate, in the large centres, a room in a public building could be obtained without much difficulty, and in oases where this was not practicable other, accommodation could be obtained at a small cost.It is recognised that it would be necessary to establish several centres for London and the surrounding district.In areas other than cities and town and urban districts the cases would be relatively few and the principal office for the receipt of applications-should be the most populous town in the area, unless some other town were more accessible or suitable.   Probably in these cases postal com-munication would, in the first instance, have largely to be depended upon. It should, however, be possible for a local solicitor on the rota to make preliminary enquiries and communicate with the centre, and the Com-mittee there should, in a clear case, adopt his report, without requiring. the applicant to attend for a personal interview in the first instance. Alternatively, the Committee might appoint an agent at each town in the -area where a sitting of the County Court was held, who might make the preliminary enquiries.   The essential point must be that the Committee-should keep control and exercise supervision.   Geographical and other considerations must be taken into account, and difficulties should be over-come  by  each Law   Society   formulating a  sohemo   for the   efficient-administration of its own area.
