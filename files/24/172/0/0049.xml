[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March..1925*CONFIDENTIAL.[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.]I HAVE just had a very interesting conversation with M. Briand, who had expressed the desire that we should find an opportunity for an early exchange of views.He began by referring to the Protocol, and I sketched to him briefly the principal reasons which had decided His Majesty&apos;s Government to refuse their signature. M. Briand said that he fully appreciated the force of our reasons for a Government situated as we are. On the other hand, France must of course again express her complete approval of that document. He was only anxious, however, that its rejection by us should not weaken the authority of the League itself, in which, after&apos; all, must rest much of our hope for the future peace of the world.I replied that we fully shared his views on this point, and had for that reason decided to refrain from stating fully some of out objections to the Protocol lest they should seem in any way to animadvert upon the Covenant itself.M. Briand then asked if my statement was going to be a simple negative, or whether it would suggest in any way fresh steps.I enquired whether M. Herriot had told him the purport of our conversations in Paris, and learning that M. Briand was generally informed of them, I stated them in my own language, and then said that the concluding passage of my declaration would indicate our idea that for the present further security for the peace of the world was to be found rather in mutual agreements between the States interested in particular boundaries than in any general change in or addition to the Covenant.I found M. Briand, who in conversation always shows a spirit of sweet reasonableness, much more favourable to this idea than&quot; I had expected. He at any rate would appear to have realised that the decision of the British Government definitely excludes their participation in any other form of settlement, and to be anxious to make the best of what, from his point of view, may be a bad business, instead of rejecting our assistance in the only form in which we can offer it. He was equally reasonable in his views upon the eastern frontiers. Our object, he said, must be, on the one hand, to prevent the Poles from prejudicing the future by immediate declarations that there can never be any modification whatever in the existing conditions; and, oh the other hand, to prevent the Germans from talking as if they meant to force an immediate change. He said that, undoubtedly, if Germany could be brought into the League of Nations, and if satisfactory arrange-ments could be made about the western frontier, it must be admitted that there was much in the present arrangement of the map in the east which lent itself to serious criticism, and if the two parties would take time and show patience, their mutual interests, especially their economic and financial interests, would very probably lead them to an agreement. After all, the Germans were already back in the management of the Silesian mines. Their skill, their organisation, and the need the Poles had of their services, had brought this about, and the same forces, given time, might easily lead to a solution of other difficulties.It would obviously be unwise to attach too great importance to an informal conversation of this kind with a man who, however distinguished and influential, has not at the moment the responsibilities of a Minister; but I am encouraged to hope that his influence with M. Herriot and wdth French public opinion will be directed towards trying to find a solution which will be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government.CABINET.Memorandum by Mr. Austen Chamberlain.2737-3     [12824]
He passed from these greater questions to tw/o .orthree matters which are preoccupying the minds of the members of the Council and promise to create some difficulties for us. First he raised the question of the Saar. I said that he might have observed that I had been severely criticised for the decision which I had taken at the request of the French Government, but of course I adhered tq that decision, and should support the renomination of M. Rault. M. Briand interjected :&apos; That would be for one year,&quot; and I said &quot;Yes.&quot; I then added that of the original members of the commission only two remained, M. Rault and the Belgian. I thought that it was desirable -that we should introduce some new blood, and I enquired whether M. Briand thought that we could persuade the Belgians to acquiesce in the appointment of another representative in place of the Belgian. M. Briand suggested that we should discuss this with M. Hymans, who arrives to-morrow. He was afraid, however, that the suggestion Avould meet with considerable difficulties, especially as Belgium was on the eve of a general election, which was always a bad moment for making any concession.Then I raised the question of the police and of the troops, and learnt that M. Rault would announce that he had already invited the French Government to withdraw one battalion of the troops, and would propose to proceed with the further recruitment of policemen so as to enable him to dispense with more troops.I proceeded to call M. Briand&apos;s attention to the distribution of portfolios, and invited him to consider whether some of those which M. Rault.now held might not Ayell be distributed among his colleagues. M. Briand said that we might discuss that matter, but that in&apos;any case it had the less importance, as M. Rault would only be there for one year more.I then raised the delicate questions which are to come before us in regard to the Port of Danzig. We shall discuss them to-morrow in secret session, where we may have a sharp divergence of opinion; but I hope that M. Briand will use his influence on the side of moderation. I am myself advised that it is impossible to give unqualified support to the decisions of the High Commissioner.Nexjt I alluded to the difference of opinion which had been disclosed in the Organisation Committee on the question of the right of the Council to establish a permanent control in the demilitarised zone when&apos;the League takes over the super-vision of that area. M. Briand surprised me by saying that he thought the best thing would be to temporise and not to take any immediate decision. We might perhaps refer the matter back to the Organisation Committee for further study, with the suggestion that they should see what other means for avoiding dangerous delay could be devised. Speaking for himself, M. Briand said that he attached little importance to the matter. It was only important because at this moment it excited public opinion, and if we could adjourn it till the next Council meeting and had in the meantime made progress with our security negotiations, and if the Germans were ready to join the League, it was probable that the question would settle itself so that it could be discussed&apos; in quite different circumstances and an arrangement made by agreement.&apos;^ Finally, M. Briand enquired what were my ideas about the reply of the Council to the German note respecting the conditions on which Germany would enter the Leagues I replied that upon the substance of the reply I conceived there would be no difference of opinion between us. Both the French and British Governments were agreed that there could not be two categories of membership, and the only question which might give us a little trouble was the form of pur reply. I was inclined to think that it should be as short as was compatible with politeness, and that the best thing wquljj&apos; be,&apos; after a little discussion among members of the Council in a secret session, tp ask one of our members sketch a draft for our consideration. It would be better that this dish should be prepared in the kitchen and not brought into the piping rqpmuntil the cooks had done their work.M. Briand said that he entirely agreed, but changed my metaphpr, and suggested that the patient should be put to sleep in the ante-chamber before he was brought into the operating theatre. ^Geneva, March 9, 1925.
