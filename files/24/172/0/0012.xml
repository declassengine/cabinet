[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.SECRET. Copy No   ft 9CP. 112 (25).CABINET.REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS.PROTOCOL FOR THE PACIFIC SETTLEMENT OF international disputes.FRENCH AND BELGIAN SECURITY.Memorandum by the Right Hon. Viscount Cecil oe Chelwood, K.C.I WAS reproached at the Committee of Imperial Defence recently with not having put forward any constructive proposals. The annexed memorandum is an attempt to supply this defect.It is doubtless right that a British Government should consider any proposals made to it from the point of view of British interests. What then are British interests in connection with the various questions raised by the Geneva Protocol ?In the first place we want safety for these islands and the Empire. Next we want restoration of international credit and confidence for our commerce. Lastly we want economy in our administration. All these objects depend more or less on a restoration of European security. The most important aspect of this for \is is the security of the Western nations, and particularly of France and Belgium, and perhaps Holland, since it is from their territories that attacks on us by air and sea could be most easily launched. We ought, therefore, to put the security of these countries in the forefront of our policy, but we ought not to forget that their security may be threatened in many other ways than by invasion of their territory. For instance, a new partition of Poland by Germany and Russia would immensely increase the dangers of France ; and the absorption of Austria by Germany might easily produce a situation which the French could scarcely ignore. If, therefore, we wish to make safe the Channel ports and their hinter land we cannot leave out of consideration the general international position in Europe, though it might well be that local wars might occur in the Balkans and else-where from which the danger to us would be very slight. On the other hand, our power is limited and our people are traditionally distrustful of foreign complications. There are besides the difficulties caused by the opinions and interests of our Dominions. We cannot therefore do much, if anything, to guarantee the security of Central and Eastern Europe certainly not much more than we already do by the Covenant of the League of Nations. It is reasonable that the main burden of providing for the security of those territories should be left on the shoulders of those countries which are more directly interested. The most that we can usefully attempt is to make some effective contribution towards the safety of Western Europe. Tf this view be adopted, the general line of policy would be for Us to undertake definite and specific obligations with regard, let us say, to France, Belgium and Germany, leaving the safety of Poland, for instance, to the care of the Central European States with, it may be, the assistance of France. The great danger of a policy of this kind is that it may easily result in the formation of groups of countries, which will gradually grow into hostile confederations. Several safeguards suggest themselves :One is that all groupings should be under the supervision of the League of Nations and that if possible the casus foederis should include some kind of approval of the Council of the League. [12741 a]
^. &apos; Next, jMs^e^^^^^^^^^buiJ^ai^ form of. ispeeific obligations undertaken by .&apos;the various countries should, be,:, regarded .merely as supplementary to some more general qbligatibn jo, preserve peace, even if that obligation is of a very slight orshadowy description.(Thirdly,. Germany and France must be brought into the same group. Unless this is done the old, vvar. divisions will survive, and in the end security will be diminished father.than.increased.   This condition is indeed the &quot;acid test&quot; of the whole scheme.Finally, it is almost essential to any policy of this kind that it should include some real effort at the limitation and reduction of armaments. Not only are armaments an immense, economic burden on the countries of Europe, hindering their economic reconstruction, but unless some limitation is put ou them there will always be a tendency towards competition, and competition in armaments produces the kind of atmosphere which gives rise to war. Moreover, if a very large proportion of the population of Europe is militarised, that affects the policy of their Governments. Germany before the war was an extreme case, but it is by no means an isolated instance, of the evil referred to.To give precision to these suggestions, I append a skeleton draft of the kind of thing I have in mind : 1. The High Contracting Parties agree that they will abstain from all aggressive war against one another.2. In the case of any dispute arising between any of the High Contracting Parties which cannot be settled under. Articles 12-15 of the Covenant, they agree that if any one or more of them resorts to aggressive war the others shall forthwith break off diplomatic relations with the aggressor or aggressors, and shall consult together as to what further steps they can take to bring the aggression to an end. For this purpose any one of the High Contracting Parties, whether parties to the dispute or not, may ask for the assistance of the Council of the League of Nations, which may take such steps as they may deem desirable to compose the dispute or minimise its consequences, including the offer of mediation or arbitration, the recom-mendation of demilitarised zones between the disputants, &amp;c.3. Any two or more of the High Contracting Parties may enter into special obligations with regard to particular disputes, or classes of disputes, by which they may agree to come more fully to the assistance of any party attacked than is provided in the previous articles. Any such agreement shall be subject to the supervision and sanction of the League, and must be of such a nature as will enable any other of the High Contracting Parties to join it.4. Immediately on the ratification of this Convention the Council of the League shah be invited to ask the Co-ordination Committee to draw up a scheme for the limitation and reduction of armaments of the High Contracting Parties, provided that in the first instance the scheme shall deal rather with the principles of limitation and reduction than with the actual figures recommended for each country.As soon as such a scheme has been drawn up the Council may summon a Conference to consider it and how it can be applied to the existing international situation.This Convention shall continue in force for (five1 years, provided that if before that time a scheme for limitation and reduction of armaments has been agreed upon it shall continue for another (ten) years.5. This Convention shall in the first instance apply to Europe only, and shall come into force when the European Powers, having permanent seats on the Council, and not less than three European Powers having non-permanent seats, have ratified it.This Convention would be accompanied by a special agreement between France, Germany and England by which they would bind themselves in the case of aggression by any one of them on the others to resist such aggression with all their forces. The agreement would make it clear that 1. No obligation would rest on any of the parties unless they believed the casusfcederis to have arisen ; and 2. The Council of the League should as soon as possible, and, if possible, before any action under the agreement, declare whether, in their view, the casusfeeder is had arisen.
I have not in this paper i;re erred: fiP%lie^ic^f^^^^^ii^^^^&amp;^a :s&apos;omb such policy as is there sketched, such as pur ^treaty, obligations to promote disarhiament, our repeated recognition of the French claim to security, and the various offers,&quot;made and withdrawn in connection therewith, or the grave injury it must cause&quot;ftp &quot;the League if, after successive Governments have, encouraged it to seek a solution of these problems, we reject, without suggesting any alternative, proposals assented to by some forty-eight of its members and actually signed by more than a dozen of them. Nor have I dwelt on the fact that we have cut down very considerably both our army and navy, and for reasons which are likely to increase rather than diminish in weight. That process, if continued in an armed Europe of the old type, must produce a very serious situation. These are considerations of the very greatest importance, and if I have not enlarged upon them, it is only because I believe that they are already familiar to my colleagues.Ft.
