Sj) R E Tc P. 137  (25),c A 3  IT,PROPOSAL TO GUARANTEE UNDER THE TRADE FA CIL ITIES ACTS A LQAfTFoK Tgg COMPLETION OF THE BENGUElXA&quot;Mote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,,I circulate for the information of my colleagues a memorandum prepared in the Treasury in regerd to an application for     guarantee under the Trade Facilities Acts In respee-t.., of the completion of the Benguella Railway0     The objections which, as Secretary of State for the Colonies,  I took in 1922 on grounds of policy have no longer the same force, but my successor in that office still feels that there are serious difficulties0 On the other hand, if on the advice of the Advisory Committee a guarantee is given it 7*111 mean orders to the extent of  1,500,000 being placed in this country Instead of abroad and from the point of view of unemployment this is very much to be desired.W o S c C treasury Chambers, SeW0 4th March, 1925.Ifij-DQCPMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT),
Before any decision can be reached on the proposal that the Treasury should guarantee under the Trade Facilities Acts a loan for the completion of the Benguella Railway, it is necessary to obtain the guidance of the Cabinet in a matter of principle which arises in connection with It,The Railway at present extends from Lobito Bay on the West Coast of Africa to half way across Portuguese Angola.     Application was first made early in 19^2 for a guarantee of a loan of  3 million which would be spent on completing the railway to the Belgian frontier where it would meet the Belgian Government Railway line from the Katanga Copper^ Llines.:     The Belgian Government are under agreement (signed in 1908 and open to revision for the first time in 1920 - when no revision was made - and thereafter every 10 years) to complete their line to a point on the Belgian frontier on the same date as the Benguella line reaches that point,      (It should here be mentioned that there was in 1922 much public criticism In Belgium against the proposed railway which was regarded as a direct blow on our part at another railway which the Belgian Government were proposing to construct from Bukama via Kasai to the Congo mouth, that is entirely through Belgian territory.     So far as Is known no such criticism has been heard recently and since the Foreign Office have always been favourable to the project now under discussion it is assumed that no serious revival of opposition is likely In Belgian circles^)Although all the shares in the Benguella Railway Company are held by Tanganyika Concessions, Ltd9, which Is a purely British Company, the Railway Company itself is
technically a Portuguese Company, registered in Portugal with its Head Office in Lisbon and holding a concession ,1 ich expires in 1930 from the Portuguese Government.      The first possibility therefore which had to be faced was that of vexatious interference by the Portuguese Government in the management and control of the Benguella Railway.     The Foreign Office advised, however, at the time that such interference need not be feared but that if it did arise the Secretary of State would be ready to do his utmost to secure a removal of any harassing regulations or restrictions,A more Important consideration was the opposition offered to the scheme by the Union of South Africa in the interests of Southern Rhodesia with whom negotiations with regard to union were then proceeding.     Copper from the Katanga Mines is carried over the Rhodesian Railways to Beira.     This route is considerably longer than the projected route to Lobito Bay and moreover the sea route from Beira to England is very considerably longer than the sea route from Lobito Bay.      If the Benguella Railway were completed it was reasonable to suppose that the bulk of the traffic from the mines would be sent by that route and not by the Rhodesian Railways.      It was therefore represented that the result of a guarantee would be- th*t the British Government would be enabling the Portuguese Company to build a line which would be in direct competition with the Rhodesian Railways whose revenue, and to some extent the revenues of the South African Railways, would be seriously affected,  it being to the British Government^ interest to divert as much copper e)nd other traffic as possible- 2 \
to the nev.i line.     On the other hand, the development of the Katanga Copper field and the growth of population there, which depend on the completion of the Benguella railway, must undoubtedly assist the Rhodeslan railways and provide an increasing market for Rhodesian labour, food and other supplies *     Despite these latter considerations the Union of South Africa maintained its opposition and they were supported in their attitude by the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is now Chancellor of the Exchequer.     In the circumstances the application for a guarantee was not pursued.The scheme made no further progress until january?/- of this year when in view of the fact that the Union Government had announced that they no longer1 raised objection to assistance being given to the scheme under the Trade Facilities Acts, the promoters enquired of the Advisory Committee whether a fresh application would be considered,The objections of the Rhodesian Railways, referred to above, have recently been stated again at length to the Advisory Committee and supported by the High Commissioner of Southern Rhodesia on behalf of his Government.     The Railways now recognise that the Benguella Railway will be built sooner or later but whilst resigning themselves to the prospect of ordinary business competition they protest vigorously against the suggestion that such competition should be assisted by the Imperial Government.     The Government of Southern Rhodesia Is probably more directly concerned with the suggestion that as the copper traffic provides more than one third of the net revenues of the Rhodesian railways loss of this traffic would Involve an increase of rates in Southern Rhodesia
generally. The Secretary of State for the Colonies supports these objections and asks that no guarantee shall be given.On the other hand, the Advisory Committee are satisfied that the promoters could if necessary, provide the money required to complete the line and they think it probable that the promoters have definitely decided to proceed with the construction of the Railway as rapidly as possible.      It is most likely therefore, that If the money Is raised without a guarantee purchases of materials totalling on the Company&apos;s figures about  1,500,000 will be made abroad where prices are undoubtedly lower than those in this country.     This being so, should we place obstacles in the way of securing the contracts for this country?The case against the guarantee on grounds of Imperial policy was considered to be conclusive in 1922 and is still so regarded by the Colonial Office but there are two new factors which ought to be taken into account.     In the first place, although the Government of Southern Rhodesia supports the interests of the Rhodesian railways, the Union Government has withdrawn its opposition and Northern Rhodesian interests are believed to be favourable to the scheme;    in the second place the probability is much greater to-day than it was two years ago that the Benguella railway will be completed whether a guarantee Is given or not.     A careful balancing of the arguments on both sides seems to lead to the conclusion that no political objections should be raised to a guarantee and that the Advisory Committee should be asked to consider the application on its merits.
Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.IN view of the prominence which has been given to the question of the wages and conditions of railwaymen, and the reports as to the imminence of a crisis, I think my colleagues should be advised as to the present position. I accordingly circulate the annexed memorandum for information. As it is the first memorandum on this subject, a synopsis has been given of the circumstances leading up to the present situation. Any subsequent note on this subject will merely deal briefly with later developments.It will be seen that the railway question contains two more or less distinct problems, that of the N.U.R. demand generally, which covers the traffic grades, and the case of the railway skilled mechanics or &quot; shopmen.&quot; The enginemen and firemen also frequently take up an attitude distinct from and sometimes in opposition to that of the N.U.R.A. S.-M.Ministry of Labour, March 5, 1925.[12V9fi.\]
