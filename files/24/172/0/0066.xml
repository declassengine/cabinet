[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.][C 3726/459/18]Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Sir Eyre Crowe. (Received March 16.)My dear Crowe, British Delegation, Geneva, March 12, 1925.I MADE an opportunity yesterday for conversations, first with M. Benes, and subsequently with M. Hymans. They were not very informative, but of course 1 took the opportunity to repeat to M. Hymans in substance all that I had said to M. Herriot in Paris.M. Hymans told me that, on receiving the memorandum, he had at once called the attention of the German Ambassador in Brussels to the absence of any mention of Be]belgium. The Ambassador had returned a day or two later to assure him that it was the intention of the Germans to include Belgium and the Belgian frontier in their proposals, and that the omission was only due to their having worked on the phraseology of an earlier draft, the terms of which they had changed without observing that the new form excluded Belgium. M. Hymans said that the interest of Belgium was, of course, primarily on the west, and it did not wish to be entangled with the affairs of Poland. At the same time, the Belgian Government must take account of the sympathy felt for Poland, partly because it was another Catholic country, and partly because Poland, like Belgium, was a small nation which had suffered great hardships. As far as he is concerned, he is obviously prepared to treat the German proposals and our suggestions seriously, and he had told M. Herriot that neither France nor Belgium could afford to reject our ideas without the most careful consideration.I made it quite clear to him, as I had done to M. Herriot, that it was only within the cadre that 1 had traced that our co-operation was possible.To M. Benes I spoke much less fully, or perhaps I should more truly say that he left me very little time to say anything. He, of course, knew that we had decided not to sign the protocol, and he spent most of his time in elaborating his views on the subject. From his long statement I gathered that he did not attach great importance to the protocol, that he was quite prepared to consider mutual treaties of guarantee and arbitration with his neighbours, and that, au fond, he felt that it was Poland which was menaced and not Czechoslovakia. He repeated what he had said at Rome, that, after all, if peace were secure in the west, that would do more than anything else to stabilise Europe and to render an outbreak of war in the east unlikely. Incidentally he told me that Czechoslovakia had no obligations for the defence of Bessarabia. The treaty with Roumania excluded all obligations in respect of that territory.The council is working smoothly and with a real spirit of goodwill and concilia-tion. We have settled, partly by adjournment, our differences with the French in regard to control in the Rhineland, Briand himself observing that perhaps by the time there was a demilitarised area and we had finally to take a decision, Germany might be a member of the League of Nations, and the question might perhaps be discussed in much more favourable circumstances. The Swede had got Poincare s letter up his sleeve, and as I saw him approaching the subject I thought it friendly to warn M. Briand of what was coming, so I passed him my copy of the letter. He turned to his neighbour on the other side exclaiming : &quot; Quelle guigne ! Faut-il que je le trouve toujours sur ma route ? &quot; He handled a difficult situation with admirable skill and bonhomie, and we all enjoyed ourselves as if we had been at the play. This was in private session.I have just made our declaration on the subject of the protocol. I am told by spectators that it sounded as impressive when read aloud as we had found it admirable when we discussed it in council.Please show this letter to the Prime Minister, and, if he wishes, communicate it to the Cabinet.Yours sincerely,AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.2737-5   [12857]
