[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1925.SECRET.35CP. 186 (25).CABINET.IMPERIAL  WAR  GRAVES   COMMISSION.Endowment Fund. Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.MY proposal for making provision for an Endowment Fund is to ask Parliament to vote annually over a term of ten years such a sum as will at compound interest accumulate to the desired capital amount at the end of the term.I am informed that large capital expenditure will be required by the Commission to complete the works of construction, &amp;c, of the cemeteries during the next four years. The estimated total expenditure of the Commission in those four years is  4,500,000; and while precise estimates have not been given me, it is understood that of this sum not less than  3,500,000 will be required for non-recurrent expenditure on construction.While the taxpayer is finding the money both for current maintenance and the above capital construction, it would be unfair that he should also provide funds in order to relieve subsequent generations of taxpayers of current costs of maintenance. I propose, therefore, that the first year of the contribution to the annuity should be the fifth year from the present. During the ten years&apos; period, the Vote would provide (a) for current maintenance and (&amp;) for contribution to Endowment Fund. After the fourteenth year from now no Parliamentary Vote would be required.Assuming a total capital sum of  5,000,000 to be required, and the rate of interest to be 4f per cent., the annuity would be  409,266. The British Exchequer share of this payment would be  333,634. The precise figures would be subject to adjustment, having regard to the total required and the rate of interest; and in four years&apos; time we should be in a better position to calculate more precisely the annual sum required for maintenance.We should, of course, give a pledge now to the Commission that we accept in principle the creation of an Endowment Fund, without commitment as to the actual total sum; the figures given above are purely hypothetical.* w. s. c.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, March 30, 1925.[12907]
