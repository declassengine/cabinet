(cp. 143 (25)).the handing over of the imperial institute to the university of london will, no doubt, give the university a fairly adequate headquarters building.   but this was the least of the objects which the government had in mind when they offered the bloomsbury site to the university.   the main object was to secure some real co-ordination of teaching on the academic side of the university.    mr. FisherT8 contention was that university college and king&apos;s college were, to a large extent, duplicating each other1b work;   that the students of the university had no proper facilities for attending lectures, both at kingfs and university; that on its academic side the university was, therefore, not an efficient teaching centre;   and that this inter-college competition involved a waste of public money in the Treasury grants to the different colleges,     it is clear that the arrange-ment about the imperial institute will not touch this problem and that in so far aB that arrangement involves the abandonment of the bloomsbury site, it tends to postpone any solution indefinitely.
My view as President of the Board of Education is, on the whole, that we should keep open the question of the Bloomsbury Site until the present Departmental Committee which is inquiring into the University of London has reported and until the Government has. decided its policy on that Report. I do not myself think that we need despair of the Bloomsbury Site.   If we succeed in giving the University of London a wcrk-able akd businesslike constitution in place of the present unwieldy Senate, I believe it inay be possible to raise from private sources, the funds necessary to move King^s College to the Bloomsbury Site.   I feel quite sure that it is impossible to provide 1 on the Strand or the Embankment the additional accommodation which King&apos;s ought to have if it is to keep up to modem requirements.March 10th 1925.,
