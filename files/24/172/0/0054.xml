(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)C A B I HE T.EGRET..P.  154(25)&apos;.LICENSING REFORM.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1 have read with,  I must confess, grave anxiety the memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal. , I am of course impressed by the pledges which he gave in his capacity of Leader of the Opposition last year,  but 1 do venture to suggest to my colleagues one or two considerations of a political character.So far as Carlisle is concerned,  I propose to visit the district during the Autumn Recess and make a personal investigation into the success or otherwise of this scheme, and I think the House of Lords would agree that it would be impossible for the Home Secretary with the responsibilities of the first few months in office to spare time to do this before the Recess.position to advise the Government whether a further investigation by a Royal Commission is desirable or not.Lord Salisbury&apos;s proposals, however,   do not stop here. They go as far as a Royal Commission on the whole licensing question.This would with a vengeance be the letting out of the waters.Legislation, as my colleagues know,  on the drink question is perhaps the most thorny of all subjectsr    It would split the Party from top to bottom.    .There are the drink manufacturers and traders to consider;     there are the extreme temperance people who are totally against Government ownership;     there are the anti-Socialists who also take this view;    there are the Church of England and other Christian communities who wantUntil I have made that investigation&quot;I am not in a
DS6-7to do something without quite knowing what the result of their action would be.I have been concerned with temperance work all my life. I know the terrible difficulties;    I know the passions which arise, and I trust some method may be found of satisfying Lord Lamington without plunging into the sea of controversy which a Royal Commission would arouse.W.J.H.th March,   1925.
