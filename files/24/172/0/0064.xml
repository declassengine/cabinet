THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.lP.164(25) . PUBLIC HEALTH BILL,  1925. - -^&quot;J-MEMORANDUM BY,THE MINISTER   OF   HEALTH.I circulate herewith a copy of the Public Health Bill: presented by Mr. Womersley, which Is the second Order 011 Friday next the 20th instant, and may obtain a Second Reading.It will be necessary to indicate the Government&apos;s attitude towards the Dill and we shall no doubt be asked to give it facilities in its later stages.The Bill has been carefully examined by the Ministry of Health, who have assisted in its preparation. It consists of a series of clauses based on provisions which have been commonly allowed in Local Acts passed since 1907.The Local Legislation Committee have repeatedly oalled attention to-the necessity for a further general Public Health Act embodying the various provisions passed by. them in Local Acts.   They have also emphasised the need for the consolidation of the existing Publio Health Acts. This work Is now in hand, but it is an essential preliminary that the provisions now allowed as a matter of course in Local Acts should be made of general application.I, therefore, ask the Cabinet to authorise me to give the Bill my general support, without, of course, commlttin myself to. the approval of any particular provision, and to undertake that the Government will afford such facilities as may bo necessary at later stages.(Initialled)^   N.C.March 17th,  1925.
Public Health Bill.MEMORANDUM.Since the Public Health Act, 1875, several public general Acts have been passed by Parliament with the object of including in the general law provisions relating to public health, which previously had been commonly allowed in local Acts. These public Acts were so framed as to give the local authorities an option of deciding whether their provisions should or should not extend to the district of the local authority, either by requiring an adoption of the provisions by the local authority, or an order of a Government department, putting the provisions in force in a particular area.For the most part, this Bill consists of a collection of clauses which have been commonly allowed in- local Acts passed since 1907, but an attempt has been made to simplify the clauses and to bring them into a more suitable form for general legislation.Following the precedents above-mentioned, it is proposed that Parts II. to VI. of the Bill should operate only upon adoption by the local authority. On the other hand, it is thought that the clauses in Part VII. (Infectious Disease), Part VIII. (Miscellaneous) and Part IX. (Baths and Washhouses) may be allowed to operate &quot;without requiring such an adoption.In general, the Bill applies to England and Wales exclusive of the administrative county of London, but the amendments of the Baths and Washhouses Acts, 1846 to 1899, proposed in Part IX. of the Bill, will extend to London as well as to the remainder of England and Wales.[Bill 38]a
