[This Document is the .Propgrty of His Britagnie Majesty&apos;s Government, ] Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.SECRET. Copy. No.  -89CP. 120 (25).CABINET.POLITICAL OUTLOOK IN THE PAR EAST. [Circulated to the Cabinet by request of the $BonDTiiaiirjiFffiTiwu^EORFoiflliiCiaT iAiT-VHl)&quot;&apos; &quot;the faiBORIirrAllir n r^ift TATBEStatements made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Lord President of the Council at the 193?^ Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on January 5, 1925.(Stenographic Note.)Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : Mr. Prime Minister, you have asked me to make a statement as to the political outlook in the Far East and as to the prospects of peace or war in that part of the world, and, I suggest, in the first instance, at any rate, it would be more convenient that a statement of this kind should be made to the Committee of Imperial Defence rather than to the Cabinet, to whom it can be reported if necessary.I regard the prospect of war in the Far East as very remote. I cannot conceive of any circumstances in which, singlehanded, we are likely to go to war with Japan. I cannot conceive it possible that Japan, singlehanded, should seek a conflict with us. The only case in which I think Japan (which is an uneasy and rather restless Power, whose action is not always easy to predicate) might become dangerous is after a new regrouping of the European Powers. In other words, unless we see signs of a German-Russo-Japanese Alliance or agreement, I should not anticipate war between ourselves and Japan. I should regard the signs of such an agreement, such a new regrouping of the Powers as being a danger signal which would at once caT our attention to the situation and would require that we should review it afresh. Of that regroupment there is at present no sign. Germany is not yet in a position in which she can enter into engagements of that kind. There is no sign at present of an agreement between Russia and Japan, and I think it would be with difficulty that they would reconcile their interests for the purposes of such an agreement. Therefore, at the present time, I should regard the danger of war between ourselves and Japan as being as remote as the danger of war with any other Great Power. Japan has ambitions in China. I am quite certain that she is not seeking an occasion to make a war for the. sake of China, and would be very reluctant to do so, but I cannot conceive at present of a development of Japanese policy in China which, if it were antagonistic to us or offensive to our sentiments, would not be even more offensive, or at least equally offensive, to America, and where we should not be acting with America instead of acting alone. As long as Japan is isolated, as she will be if she parts company with America, and ourselves, it seems to me inconceivable that she should seek a quarrel or get into a position in which she cannot avoid a quarrel with America and ourselves. Japan is at the present time unhappy. I think she has felt grievously the termination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. That gave her, if I may use the phrase, a social standing which she valued very much. It linked her in a position of equality with, one of the Great Powers of the West, and undoubtedly it was a great blow to her when we terminated the alliance. On top of that, which left her rather sore, rather uneasy, there has come the unfortunate legislation passed over the head of the President by Congress a little time ago which put into the form of a national law -I do not think it did much more than that the restriction of Japanese immigration into America, which had formerly been settled by what had been called the &quot; Gentlemen&apos;s Agreement.&quot; It is a matter of pride, of self-respect, but Japan has felt that also deeply, and it has had the more effect because it has come on the top of the severance of the old and intimate relations with England. But though the Alliance has ended, I think [12763]
it is the desire of the Japanese statesmen and the Japanese Government to keep the spirit of- the Alliance as much alive as possible, and I have tried to respond to that feeling. - In the very first conversation I had with the Japanese Ambassador I recalled the Alliance and its origin. As a matter of fact my father had a great deal to do with its origin. I recalled that fact and said that I, his son, naturally wished to preserve the spirit of the Alliance and wished to co-operate in the same way, though the Alliance itself had been terminated. Particularly in regard to China 1 was very anxious that Japan, America and ourselves should give the same counsel, and, if ever the time came for action, should act together, and that it was only by our intimate union and agreement that any good results could come. There is a party in Japan, no doubt, which, since the termination of the Alliance, still more . since the American action in regard to immigration, has been inclined to favour the idea of a purely Eastern policy, turning its back on the West and making Japan the centre of an Eastern policy. That party is not influential at present. I do not think it finds any echo in Government circles, but if ever there were signs of a regroupment such as I have spoken of, of a Russo-Japanese Alliance or a German-Russo-Japanese agreement, that party would undoubtedly give its support to that policy. On the whole, therefore, I draw the conclusion that there is no danger of war with Japan in present circumstances; that before there can be any danger of war with Japan there must be a political movement which cannot be hid from our eyes and which will give us fair warning, and from the Foreign Office point of view, that is, from the point of view of the general conduct of our foreign relations, I should strongly deprecate anything that can be read here or elsewhere as com-petitive building between ourselves and Japan in anticipation of a new struggle. If the danger of a struggle ever materialises, I think we shall have plenty of warning, and it would be a great mistake to disquiet the Japanese, to render them more nervous than they are. i think they would be rather frightened by any appearance of a hostile programme of naval shipbuilding, which they would interpret not as a measure of protection on our part, but as preparation for an aggressive attack upon them at some time. On the other hand, I should like to say that we are glad that the Government have decided that they will proceed with the Singapore base. I do not presume for a moment to indicate the rate at which those works should proceed, but the Foreign Office never liked the abandonment of that base. America has given up her right to fortify Guam Island, and has thereby undoubtedly placed herself in a less good position for any operations in the Far East than she otherwise Would have been. Whether, if there were such a regroupment as I have spoken- of, leading up to war, we could allow our fleet to leave European waters is quite another question and one in which I am not competent to offer any decided opinion. I only venture to allude to the possibility that if war did arise in such circumstances as that, we might find we required to keep our fleet in home waters. But in any case, that we should have Singapore as a necessary link in our line of Imperial communica-tions I consider sound policy and in itself something of a guarantee for peace, because it is never a guarantee for peace that you should have great territories open without defence to possible attack, but I repeat that I regard the possibilities of such attack as being very remote; as being dependent upon a regroupment of Powers, which cannot take place without our knowing it and without giving us time to make our further preparations if we then think it necessary to do so.Perhaps I should add this in regard to Japan. Of course, its domestic position is an unhappy one at the present time. It has suffered tremendously by the earth-quake. Its finances have been-1 was going to say ruined-at any rate, profoundly upset, and that again strengthens nry argument that there is no conceivable danger at the present time. Japan is much more inclined to fear aggression by others than to contemplate aggression on others at the present moment.LORD CURZON : I do not think I have anything to add to the statement made by the Foreign Secretary, with which I cordially agree, except this, that all our evidence from Japan-and some of us have friends who write to us from there apart from the official statements which we read-tends to show that while Japan feels sore and sorry and rather sick at the loss of the British Alliance, she is anxious to replace it, as far as she possibly can, by intimate and cordial relations between ourselves, and therefore, quite apart from the remote risk of any such regrouping of the Powers as Mr. Chamberlain has talked of, there is in Japan itself the strongest pro-British sentiment at the present time, and it is scarcely possible, so far as I can judge, to conceive of any state of affairs in which the general trend of Japanese policy would for many years to come be anti-British. That is the only contribution, for what it is worth, I have to make to the discussion.
