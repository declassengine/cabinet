THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRETCP.190(25). CABINET.(Home Affairs Committee). MINERS&apos; WELFARE FUND.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate the attached Memorandum covering a draft of the Mining Industry (Welfare Fund) Bill. The Bill is non-contentious, Involves no charge on public funds, and represents a not unimportant measure of agreement between the mine owners and the miners in the interest of the latter.      I ask for authority to Introduce the Bill at once, and that the Bill shall be placed in the category of those which it is essential to pass this Session.P.C-L.Board of Trade.31st March, 1925.
MINERS&apos; WELFARE FUND Memorandum by Secretary for Mines.I should be glad of Cabinet Sanction to introduce the attached Bill Immediately.      The object of it is to extend the period of the Miners 1 Welfare Fund for an additional period of 5 years.Section 20 of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, provided for the establishment of a Welfare Fund &quot;for such purposes connected with the social well-being recreation and conditions of living of workers in or about coal mines and with mining education and research, as the Board of Trade, after consultation with any Government Departments concerned, may approve&quot;.The fund is derived from a levy of a penny a ton on the output of all coal mines.     This levy is collected, and the payments made, by the Mines Department, but the allocation of the money is in the hands of a Committee of five, appointed by the Secretary for Mines, of which Lord Chelmsford is at present Chairman.      The Committee includes one member nominated by the Miners1 Federation and another nominated by the Mining Association. 500,000 has been provisionally earmarked for Health and Safety Research, and  475,000 for education.      Otherwise the money is spent upon local schemes of recreation, such as institutes, and playing grounds etc;    and upon health services such as convalescent homes, baths, etc.      In local schemes the allocating Committee is assisted by district Welfare Committees of owners and miners;    on research questions they are advised by the Safety in Mines Research
Board; and In matters of education by the University Grants Committee, the Board of Education and the Scottish Education Department.Under the existing Act the levy is payable on the output of a period of 5-  years ending 31st December 1925.     It will have amounted to approximately  5,500,000.     Up to the present time  3,925,000 has been collected and  2,884,000 allocated,The scheme has been a signal success and both owners and miners are agreed that the period of the levy should be extended; for an additional 5 years.      It is for that purpose that the attached Bill has been drafted.     The only other provision which It contains is that the membership of the allocating Committee should be increased by the addition of one more nominee of the Mining Association and one more nominee of the Miners1 Federation.     This is to meet representations made to me jointly by both bodies that they should, as a matter of principle, have a majority on the Committee.     They originally asked for a much larger majority, but I have convinced them that this would not be &quot;desirable, and the present proposal is now acceptable to them.     It is acceptable also to Lord Che1msferd.The Bill should be passed into law as soon as possible, in order that both the allocating committee and the district welfare committees may not be handicapped in the formulation of their schemes by uncertainty as to the continuance of the levy.G.R. LANE-FOX.27th March,  1925.
