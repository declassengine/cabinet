gKIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC IjIaJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) , E CRST.cabinet.SCHOOL TEACHERS&apos;   (SUPERANNUATION) DRaFT BILL. Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.1.     The system is to be a&apos; contributory one.     But the Treasury and.the Board of Education consider that, while &quot;the con-tributions are to be in respec-t only of future service&quot;, they should not be devoted to the purpose for which they profess to be levied, but should be used in aid of current expenditure.      I hold very strongly that they should be funded.     Funding, of course, would apply only to what was actually drawn from the pockets of teachers and employers.      I do not suggest that the Exchequer should itself create reserves in respect of its own future liabilities-ties.      I merely ask that it should refrain from appropriating the reserves which, others are being compelled to provide.2.    -Clause 8 of the Draft gives effect to the policy which. I deprecate.      At the same time,  Clause 16 sets up a Paper Fund - a Teachers&apos;  Pensions and Contributions Account,  intended (in the words of the Treasury and the Board)  to show &quot;what the positionwould be if the contributions had been carried to a separate Fund? This Fund is to be valued periodically, and on the results of the valuations the rates of contribution may be varied by Order in Council.      The object of such an Account is to allay apprehensions But it would,  I fear,  do little more than offer an inconveniently easy target for Parliamentary criticism.      It would be a phantom. The &quot;assets&quot; it is to contain would be dissipated before they were entered;    the accumulations it is to register would be as unreal as the interest with which they are to be credited.      The contri-but..or3 are not likely to find much comfort in the assurance that &quot;the Account will have behind it the guarantee of the State&quot;. Where is the non-contributory system of 1918, of which exactly the same was true?.V, 141(25).
3.      The one substantial argument against funding is that, although the forthcoming Budget will not be affected, a policy of appropriation would enable the taxpayer of to-day to benefit for a limited period,  from 1926--27 onwards,  at the expense of the tax-payer of to-morrow, - the latter being saddled for all time with the burden of making good his predecessors default.     The state-men t prepared by the Government Actuary shows the temporary gain and the permanent loss.4,     I yield to none of my colleagues in my desire for lower taxation.     3ut,  even were the present gain larger than it actually is,  I should still feel, with the Emmdtt Committee,  that it would be &quot;very unwise&quot; to yield to the temptation.     My reasons are mainly political;-(i)    Appropriation would give a ready opening for the charge that the Government were seeking relief for income-tax and super-tax payers at the expense of teachers and of rate-payers in general.( ii.)    It would completely destroy the actuarial basis on which the Scheme ostensibly rests,  and so undermine the con-fidence of the prospective contributors.     Without funding, the ultimate annual cost will be,  not 10$, as the Draft suggests, but as nearly as may be 20$.(iii)    In 1922 and 1924 the existing arrangement, which the Draft proposes to stereotype, was wholeheartedly denounced from all quarters of the House of Commons.     Even its sponsors could only defend it as a makeshift.      In this connection Hansard will be very embarrassing for some of us.(iv)    The Emmott Committee, which was set up ad hoc, reported unanimously that a Fund such as I propose &quot;should be regarded as an indispensable part of the machinery of the permanent scheme&quot;.      Can the Government well ignore a recom-mendation of the sort,  framed after very full consideration and signed by representatives of the Treasury and the Board of Education as well as by the Government Actuary?
(v)    There will certainly he strong Parliamentary opposition to appropriation.      I can say&quot;nothing as to the probable-attitude of the teachers of England and Wales.      But the Scottish teachers will be implacably hostile.      They fully realise that it is on the English Bill that they must fight, and they can count on support from Scottish Members of all political parties.      The Scottish temporary Act expires on July 31st,  so that even prolonged discussion would have grave ri risks.(vi)    The absence of a real Fund would place the Government at a great disadvantage throughout the Committee stage.      If there is a real Fund,  it will be an effective reply to the inevitable demand for concessions to say that they are actuarially impossible.      If the Fund is a mere Account, the Parliamentary situation will be entirely different.(vii) With the State responsible for all payments,  it will be the. duty of the Treasury and the &quot;Board,  after the Act is passed,  to keep all expenditure down to the lowest possible limits, while teachers and local authorities will be free to press claims to the uttermost, and will, moreover, be able to argue that the duty of contribution carries with it correspond-ing rights.      The inevitable result will be administrative friction and bitterness.(viii) The bringing into line of the English Local Education Authorities is an admirable achievement and offers a golden opportunity for securing a just and reasonable settlement of this troublesome question.      It would be matter for deep regret if, by taking a false step at this critical stage, we were to perpetuate a state of matters that is fraught with endless possibilities of dissatisfaction and everi resentment, not only among individual teachers,&apos; but throughout the profession as a whole.&quot;J.G.&quot;.oottish Education Department, Monday.  9th March,   1925.
