[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1-Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1925.SECRET.35CP. 165 (25).CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 114.    February 1925.THE number of persons on the Registers at the end of February was 1,236,065. a decrease of 4,857 since the end of January. As shown in the Table below, this small decrease is the net result of fluctuations in both directions, and though the usual seasonal causes were operating, their effect was almost neutralised by the increased unemployment amongst men. A steady reduction in the figures which might have been expected at this period of the year is absent.The industries which mainly contributed to this result were the coal-mining and shipbuilding industries, both of which showed a further decline, and little, if any, change for the better was reported in the iron and steel trades.On the other hand, employment was good in motor and aircraft engineering, and general engineering showed a steady but slow, progress, while the building industry continued to maintain its previous activity. The reduction in the hours of working in the American Cotton Spinning Section adopted last month did not appear to have any appreciable effect on employment in this industry.A.

II. POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES. COAL MINING.Employment in this Industry continued very slack generally and in some centres there was an increase in unemployment. In the Northumberland and Durham coalfield employment declined still further. Some collieries have closed down, and many others were working short time. The position in the South Yorkshire coal-field remained steady. In the North-Western Counties there was a definite improve-ment at Farnworth and Leigh, with a resultant decrease in unemployment. The outlook generally, however, is said to be uncertain. In South Staffordshire employment continued irregular. There was a further decline at West Bromwich, but an improvement was shown at Coalville, and trade was good at Nuneaton. In the North Staffordshire District the position, on the whole, was less satisfactory. Trade was quiet at Burslem and Hanley, but there was a slight improvement at Newcastle-under-Lyme and Longton, and employment was good at Chesterfield. A decline in employment took place at Ilkeston and Basford, but the position was better at Coventry and Oakengates, and at Mansfield and Nottingham. In the Kent mines the reabsorption of workers has been slow, a considerable amount of preparatory work being necessary before the seams can be put into working order. Little change took place in the Bristol area, but employment was good in the Gloucester area, except at Lydney, where a local colliery was closed. In Scotland, the depression in Fifeshire became more acute. At Dunfermline there was a large increase in unemployment, and a large number of informal claims to unemployment benefit was made by miners at Kirkcaldy and Leven. No substantial improvement took place in South Wales, and intermittent working was fairly general. In the Wrexham area a large colliery closed down.IRON AND STEEL.Employment in this industry remained bad, although isolated instances of improvement are reported. In the Sheffield area makers of railway and motor-car steels, and manufacturers of axles, springs, buffers, and heavy railway material continued busy. The position was not so good at Scunthorpe, and continued slackness was reported from the Leeds area. Stocks of pig-iron in the Cleveland area were still heavy, and in the absence of normal demand for export, the output is not fully absorbed. Two furnaces, one at Middlesbrough and one at West Hartlepool, were damped down during the month. Employment was fairly good at Basford and Ilkeston, and the improvement at Chesterfield was maintained. In the North Staffordshire area there was less short-time working at Hanley, but the position was poor at Stoke-on-Trent, and only fair at Burslem. Much short time was worked at Newcastle-under-Lyme. In the South Staffordshire area employment was slack at Cradley Heath, Walsall and Brierley Hill. There was a slight improvement at West Bromwich, Wolverhampton, Willenhall, and Darlaston, but the position declined at Oldbury and Bilston. Employment was good at Leicester, but at Kettering short-time working continued.From Scotland it is reported that a large firm in the Coatbridge area has damped down all its furnaces for the first time since 1829, and 450 workers were affected. The position at Motherwell was worse, and 300 workers were stood off indefinitely.In Wales, some improvement was shown, except at works directly dependent on the tin-plate trade. The position was a little better at Gorseinon and Port Talbot, and some improvement took place at Neath and Llanelly, although the position was still bad. Trade improved at Cardiff, and the position at Newport was fair. Full time was being worked in most departments at Ebbw Vale, and there were signs of improvement at Merthyr and Dowlais.TIN-PLATE TRADE.Little change took place in this industry, and there are few signs of an early resumption of full-time working. There was a slight improvement at Llanelly and Port Talbot, but at Gorseinon most of the works were idle. There was no change at Morriston, Swansea and Neath, where short-time working was the rule, as was the case at Crumlin and Chepstow. At Pontypridd the position was good and full time was worked, but at Aberdare the works were closed. TEere was a slight increase of unemployment at Newport.
SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.There was a further decline in this industry, and the outlook appears to be discouraging. On the North-East Coast there was almost a total lack of orders for new vessels, and activity in repair work also decreased. No change was reported from the Mersey-side. Repair work on the Thames was still slack, but more work was available at Gravesend. On the South Coast, employment tended to slacken in the ship yards at Southampton and Woolston following the completion of the overhaul of several large liners. A destroyer was commenced at Woolston. At Cowes two of the four destroyers being built for the Greek Government have been completed, and further discharges are anticipated. No improvement was reported from Scotland and the outlook is disquieting in view of the fact that the work on hand is nearing completion, and replacement orders are not following. In Wales the improvement in repair work was not maintained. Employment at Bute Docks, Cardiff, declined and the prospects appear to be poor. There was also little work at Newport and Swansea, and the position at Port Talbot and Pembroke Dock was far from satisfactory. At Barry there was an increase of employment among fitters and fitters&apos; labourers, but unemployment was still heavy with boiler makers. In North Wales employment was bad at Flint and Holyhead.ENGINEERING.Motor, Cycle and Aircraft Engineering. This branch of the engineering industry continued to be very active, and the improvement was generally maintained. At Birmingham increased activity was shown, while trade was good at Coventry, Derby and Nottingham, and a further improvement was reported from Wolver-hampton. In the London district there was considerable activity at Acton, Hendon, Kingston and Shepherds Bush, but trade was quiet at Slough and Tottenham in the manufacture of heavy vehicles. Aircraft factories were very busy at Hendon, Weybridge and Rochester, and this branch of the industry was also well occupied at Cheltenham.General Engineering. The steady but slow improvement previously reported was maintained in this branch of the industry.In the North-Eastern Counties, manufacturers of railway equipment remained busy, especially at Leeds, Lincoln and Horbury. The demand for tools, agricultural and gardening implements, and files remained active in the Sheffield district. Firms engaged in the manufacture of textile machinery were quiet on account&quot; of the slackness in the woollen and worsted trade, and marine engineering showed a further slight decline owing to the continued depression in shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries, especially at Stockton-on-Tees. Increased activity was shown at Stanningley in constructional engineering and crane making.In Lancashire and Cheshire a slight improvement in textile engineering took place, but short-time working was still prevailing in this branch. Full-time working was general in sections involving the manufacture of linotype machinery, machine tools, locomotives, electrical accessories, &amp;c, but there was a scarcity of orders in the heavy engineering section. In the Midlands, a general though slight improvement was shown, and the demand for skilled workers increased. Employment was good at Beeston, Chesterfield, Newark and Sutton-in-Ashfield, arid an improvement took place at Birmingham, Brierley Hill, Cradley Heath, Wolverhampton, and West Bromwich. Employment was only fair at Nottingham, Basford, Derby and Long Eaton, but firms were fairly busy at Stoke-on-Trent. Employment remained steady at Leicester, Peterborough and Stamford. In the South-Eastern Counties the previous state of activity was generally maintained, particularly in North and South-East London, but trade was quiet at Woolwich and Letchworth. Increased activity was shown at Bedford, Bishops Stortford, Colchester, and Erith, the latter place being extremely busy on machine-gun work. Employment in electrical engineering and the manufacture of wireless components was good at Dagenham and Chelmsford. In the South-Western Counties, there were signs of increased activity in the Bristol area. An improvement was shown at Caversham and Reading, while railway work at Swindon was still good, and skilled men were in demand. Employment in Wales was better on the whole. An improvement was shown at Cardiff, and full time was worked in iron foundries at Newport and Ebbw Vale. Conditions were fair at Swansea, but poor at Port Talbot, and slack at Pembroke Dock. Foundries at Llanelly were still working intermittently. In North Wales, the position at Flint was bad, and a large number of skilled men were unemployed. The improvement at Holyhead was maintained, and the conditions at Carnarvon were about normal.
TEXTILES.Cotton.-There was little change in this industry, and the reduction of hours in the spinning section (American cotton) did not make any material difference to the registers of Employment Exchanges. Employment in the manufacturing sections was better than in the spinning sections, but employment generally was good, especially in the finer fabrics. In Scotland, mills at Bridgeton were slack, but activity was shown at Paisley, and there was a demand for weavers.Woollens and Worsteds. The depression in this branch of the textile industry continued. Under-employment increased in most areas, all sections being affected. Unemployment increased at Bradford and Shipley, and in the Dewsbury area short time was general with manufacturers of heavy woolen cloths and blankets. The low woollen trade in the Stanningley area was, however, busy.In the South-Western Counties there was a return to full-time working in the blanket mills at Witney, and an improvement was shown at Chipping Norton and Taunton. In Scotland less activity was shown, and more short-time working occurred&quot; at Greenock, Bridgeton; Aberdeen, Alloa, and Dumfries. Trade was brisk at Ayr, and the prospects were better at Kilmarnock. An improvement in tweed manufacturing is forecasted at Galashiels, although mills continued on short time, but the position declined at Hawick. In Wales, a slight improvement took place at Newtown, but trade was very quiet at Llanidloes, while at Aberystwyth there were only three woollen factories working out of sixteen.Hosiery. Trade continued to be generally quiet at Nottingham. A slight improvement took place, but there was much short-time working in other places in the Midlands area.In Scotland, short time was again in operation at Aberdeen. At Galashiels, mills engaged in the manufacture of outer garments were busily employed, but those making underwear, which is the main industry in the area, were quiet. The improve-ment continued in Alexandria, but there was a falling-off at Kilmarnock, while the position was unsatisfactory at Dumfries.Lace. Heavy unemployment still continued, and trade was depressed at most centres. Short-time working was still prevalent at Basford, and trade was bad at Beeston, especially in the Levers section. A slight improvement was shown at Derby and Nottingham, but the position was bad at Long Eaton and Newark. The position was not so good in the Barnstaple area, and no change took place at Exeter and Tiverton, where short time was still being worked.Silk. A very slight improvement took place. Trade was better at Derby, Leek, Nuneaton and Cheadle, but short-time working was still prevalent at Coventry. Silk-weaving at Letchworth was slack, but a slight improvement was shown at Braintree. There was no improvement in the knitted silk-wear trades at Macclesfield.   The trade in artificial silk mnaufacture at Flint was brisk.Jute. The activity at Dundee was maintained. More orders were coming to hand, and the prospects are good. There was an extensive demand for weavers at Uundee, Forfar, Carnoustie and Kirriemuir.Carpets. Unemployment increased slightly at Kidderminster, but the workers affected were chiefly engaged in the manufacture of the cheaper class of fabric.BUILDING, BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.Work in this industry remained active generally, apart from a certain amount of lost time, due to unfavourable weather. Employment was good in all districts and the demand for skilled workers was steadily maintained. Employment amongst painters improved, but amongst unskilled operatives it was generally slack.In the brick and tile industry employment remained good, and in some districts closed brick-fields were being reopened.CLOTHING.The seasonal slackness in this industry became less intense with the approach of spring, and wholesale clothing manufacturers were better employed. In the West End wholesale dress-making was brisk, and trade was busy in ladies&apos; tailoring, with a slight improvement in men&apos;s work. The millinery trade has fallen off somewhat and hands have been discharged. In Yorkshire a general improvement in wholesale clothing manufacture took place, and the position at Leeds was more hopeful.   Some
slight improvement was shown in corset manufacture, but the glove trade was fairly slack. In the shirt and collar industry an improvement took place at Yeovil and Taunton, and very little short time was now being worked.BOOT AND SHOE.Employment in this industry showed a slight improvement. Conditions were fairly good at Mansfield, but there was still much short-time working. Trade was busier at Leicester and Stafford, fair at Wolverhampton and good at Bilston and Bromsgrove, but was slack at Wellingborough and Northampton. In the South-Eastern Counties an all-round improvement was shown, except in the heavy-boot centre at Chesham, and employment-remained steady at Hackney, fair at Stepney and good at Tottenham and Norwich. There was a slight improvement in the Bristol area and in the slipper trade in the Rossendale Valley. Full time was worked at Aberdeen, and trade was good at Ayr, but was less satisfactory at Arbroath and Maybole.POTTERY.The position in this industry improved slightly, but employment continued heavy. Trade was good at Basford, but was only moderate at Burslem, Chesterfield and Derby, where snort time was prevalent. A slight improvement took place at Stoke-on-Trent, but short-time working still prevailed at Hanley and Longton. Employment in the earthenware branch of the trade continued fair, and in the first-class china branch was good. The position was fairly satisfactory at Worcester, and there was little unemployment.DOCKS.There was an increase of unemployment among dock workers, and slackness prevailed in most areas. At ports on the North-East Coast there was a falling-off of timber imports, and the position was worse at West Hartlepool and Hull. On the Mlersey-side a slight decrease in freights was shown, but improvement was maintained at the Manchester Docks.  At the London Docks employment was slack.At Bristol, Avonmouth and Portishead employment declined, and in Wales slackness prevailed at Cardiff and Swansea.
III. WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24))]The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information i3 available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope o.f Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes gut in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Flousing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned.It should be noted that in view of recent modifications in the scope of the table the figures given cannot properly be compared with those previously announced in Parliament&apos;in similar connections. The figures given for-February 1924, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.Bridge Schemes assisted by the of certain road the Ministry of Exchanges  from	Number of Men employed at 	Works assisted by 	Feb. 28. 1925.1.Tan. 31, 11)25.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.tin addition to the figures quoted, the average number of men employed during February 1925 on the Commission^ operations (including Crown woods) was 2,476 as compared with 2,086 during February 1924.$ These figures indicate men employed on the work itself. They include part only of the men employed on the manufacture of the materials used. They take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.
IV.-OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion Authorities concerned. In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land have been agreed with the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. A number of organisations, having as their object the provision of facilities for the settlement of immigrants in certain of the Dominions, have also been assisted. An extension of this assistance to other organisations is under consideration.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the month of January (with the corresponding figures for January of last year) and for the ten months ended the 31st January, 1925 and 1924 respectively, are set out in the following Table :  Monthly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The empire settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.(1.)

The Scheme, however, closed to new applications in December 1922.[12864] c

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

Unemployment Insurance.(Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920. by an Act of general scope which appiied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924 the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to February 28, 1925.   194,762,000 17,979,000989,0002,553,000 ---   216,283,00073,654,000 66,870,000 48,536,000 3,062,000--   192,122,000819,0005,825,000 5,825,000 3,884,000--    15,534,0006,160,0001,648,000216,283,000* Note.-The old Fund at November 8th, 1920, had reached a total of  22,210,000.Estimate of Benefit payable from Armistice to March 31, 1925,  198,000,000.Expendi ture Benefit paidAppropriation for Administration Section 9 Unemployment InsuranceAct (No. 2), 1924 Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;c.....Income Contributions  EmployersEmployed .....ExchequerExchequer (for ex-Service Men)Interest (Net).... -Balance of Old Fund at Armistice (excluding Interest accrued) * Employers -EmployedExchequer .... .....Loans from Treasury (Net)....

(C.) Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a. grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund.1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Year.

Table 4. Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, of small holdings and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and (6) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry^ Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement.(A.) England and Wales.

Juveniles.After the Armistice, Juvenile Unemployment Centres were opened in certain localities to deal with the problem of unemployed juveniles. After a period of closure centres were again established, and the cost, which was originally shared by the Board of Education and Local Authorities, was, from the 1st April, 1923, to the 31st March, 1924, partly met out of Relief of Unemployment Vote by grants up to 75 per cent, in respect of approved schemes, the Local Authority providing the remaining 25 per cent. From the 1st April, 1924, the Exchequer Grant will, as an emergency measure, so long as unemployment amongst juveniles remains at its present scale, be raised to 100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses of Local Education Authorities.Net Expenditure from Armistice to March 31,1924.
