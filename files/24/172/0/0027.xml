OA B I IT E :,T. home   AFFAIRS    COMMITTEE. 1    NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE (NAVY, ARMY &amp; AIR FORCE) FUND BILL.Memorandum by the Finanoife-l Secretary to the Treasury.-II desire authority to introduce the attached Bill whic^. was classified by the Home Affairs Committee among &quot;important Bills.&quot;The object       of the Bill is to enable the surplus monies standing in the Fund in excess of the sums required to meet the. liabilities of the Fund to be transferred to the Exchequer.BThe Navy, Army and Air Force Insurance Fund is a statutory fund constituted under the National Health Insurance Act for the purpose of providing (a) maternity benefit only during service and (b) under certain conditions, after discharge, all the ordinary health insurance benefits, to men of His Majesty&apos;s Forces who are not members of Approved Societies for purposes of national health insurance.     The fund receives the contributions in respect of H   (a) men serving in His Majesty&apos;s Forces who are not members of III   Approved Societies and (b) men discharged from His Majesty&apos;s Forces I &quot;   who prove that by reason of the state of their health they are unable to obtain admission to Approved Societies,     Men in thelatter category are allowed on application to remain after discharg members of the Fund, which operates as an Approved Society in receiving their contributions and administering the ordinary benefits under the National Health Insurance Act.The conditions governing admission to membership of the Fund In the case of discharged men are, therefore, such as to limit
that membership to invalid men.     Arising out of those conditions, the Act provides that the rate of contribution to be paid by the Service Departments in respect of serving men who are not members of Approved Societies shall be prescribed by regulations from time to time at such amount as may be required to keep the Fund.solvent.The accounts of the Fund as made up to 51st December, 1923, showed that the cash assets of the Fund amounted to some  3,120,000 at that date.      In addition the Fund possessed reserve value credits of more than  1,200,000 at 31st December, 1922.The exceptional and unforeseen growth of cash assets of the Fund is considered to be mainly, if not wholly, attributable to oauses originating in the War.     During the period of the War large numbers of men who had not previously been insured joined the Forces,     Such men were entitled to exercise the option to remain uninsured, but comparatively few in fact did so,      It is indeed not improbable, that, in the conditions then prevailing, the majority of them were not made aware of or did not appreciate the option that was open to them.     The majority were consequently treated as becoming insured on joining the Forces, and contributions in respect of them were, therefore, paiddnto the Fund by the Service Departments.     Of the men who previously uninsured were treated as insured during service, a large number ceased insurance on discharge and were not heard of again, while many of course were killed or died on service.      The Fund thus received contributions in respect of the men referred to in the main from money provided by Parliament and in the result carried no liability in respoct of them.
It is therefore, proposed that an actuarial valuation of the Fund should be made as at 31st December, 1924, by the Government Actuary and that so much of the assets standing to the credit of the Fund at that date as is not required to meet the liabilities of the Fund should be paid over to the Exchequer.     As it will probably be found impracticable for a final certificate of the disposable surplus to be given for some years the Bill will provide for an interim certificate to be given so that a substantial sum may be paid to the Exchequer at an early date.Treasury Chambers. 27th February, 1925
