[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CP. 126 (25).CABINET.ARTILLERY FOR INDIAN STATES,Recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence.Note by the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence.THE Cabinet will remember that at a Meeting held on the 10th December, 1924 (Cabinet 66 (24), Conclusion 6), the recommendation made by the Committee of Imperial Defence during the tenure of office of the late Government, to the effect that 15-pr. guns should be issued to selected Indian States, subject to certain provisos,* was discussed, and that it was agreed that this recommendation should be referred back to the Committee for further examination in view of the important considerations which had led previous Governments to reject similar proposals for the grant of artillery to Indian States.The Committee of Imperial Defence discussed this question again at its 194th Meeting, when General Birdwood, who during the latter part of last year was acting as Commander-in-Chief in India during Lord Rawlinson&apos;s absence, was present. After a comprehensive discussion of the question, when the views of all the responsible authorities were set forth, the Committee agreed to reaffirm to the Cabinet their previous recommendation:I circulate herewith an extract from the Minutes of this meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and ask the assent of my colleagues to the recommendations set forth therein.i C. of K.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, March 3, 1925.* See 0 p 507 (24).f12779j
SECRET.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the IQkth Meeting, held on February 6, 1925.(1.) ARTILLERY FOR INDIAN STATES.(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 138-D and 139-D.)(Previous reference: C.I.D. Minutes of 189th Meeting, Minute 2.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a note by the Chairman and a note by the Secretary of State for India on Artillery for Indian States (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 138-D and 139-D).LORD BIRKENHEAD said that he had formed a Committee from his Council to consider this question, and this Committee had been attended by General Birdwood. It was the view of the India Council Committee that the grant of 15-pr. guns to selected Indian States should be supported, subject to certain provisos, which had already been mentioned in a previous paper (C.I.D. Paper No. 136-D). The Viceroy also strongly supported the proposal, while the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had no objection to it. He, himself, was of opinion that the proposal should be accepted unless any grave risk were involved and all the responsible authorities considered that there was no risk provided the supply of ammunition was retained in the hands of the Government.GENERAL BIRDWOOD said that he did not think that the question of the military security of India would be affected by the grant of 15-pr. guns to Indian States; in so far as he himself was concerned, if he were in high military command in India, he would not consider that the grant of these guns to Indian States would involve any risk. British troops in India were armed with 18-prs.; it was only proposed to issue 15-prs. to Indian States; these guns were obsolescent, were not quick-firers, and it should be noted that their ammunition was of such a nature that it did not keep well; hence there would be only small stocks of it available and these small stocks would be maintained in British hands and issued as required. Actually some Indian States already had 9-pr. smooth-bore guns, for which they controlled the ammunition supply, so that the grant of 15-prs. with a limited supply of ammunition was not a very great step.Mr. CHURCHILL said that although the Viceroy and the Secretary of State for India were really the responsible authorities with regard to this question his view had not been changed by anything that he had heard. He had always resisted the distribution of modern technical equipment to Indians. There was no outside danger to Indian States and he saw no reason why their armament should be improved. If 15-pr. guns were issued to Indian States now7 there would shortly be a demand for more modern guns and also in time for aeroplanes and similar new types of modern equipment so that in course of time stronger forces would be built up in India which, Instead of being valuable for purposes of Imperial defence might become an actual embarrassment to the Government in India. He drew attention to the state of affairs during the Mutiny when small bodies of Englishmen, provided they were able to collect together in some moderately strong building, were able to hold their own unless artillery was brought against them. It was of great value in a large country like India for the scattered European population to be able to collect in previously arranged places of safety where they would be secure against attacks not supported by modern equipment. He strongly deprecated the issue of these guns to Indian States. [12664-1]  [12779][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1 - -
Mb,. AMBRY drew attention to the past history of the Indian States. They had been a strong support to the British Government in the past, especially during the Mutiny and during the Great War, when they had placed their forces at our disposal. He thought it was most desirable to encourage the loyalty of the Indian Chiefs in every way; if they were offended, it was possible&quot; that our troubles in India might be much increased, while a gradual granting of concessions to them was likely to increase their confidence and render their forces of more value to us. It should be remembered that in India reliance must necessarily be-placed on some form of Native assistance.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that, as a result of the letter from the Viceroy (C.I.D. Paper No. 139-D), the Air Staff had reconsidered their views as regards the possession of aircraft by Indian States. Should 15-prs. be given to Indian States as was now being recommended, it would not be necessary for them to have aircraft for spotting purposes. However, it had already- been suggested that a demand for aeroplanes would come later. As regards this point, he thought it would be better to make no mention of it now and leave the demand for consideration when it arose. At present the Chiefs had commercial aeroplanes, and the border-line between them and military aircraft was difficult to draw. Further, the Air Staff did not see that there was any real objection to the Chiefs having even military aircraft owing to the great difficulty which they would experience in providing the necessary money, personnel and material to keep an Air Force in being. Afghanistan had been trying to start an Air Force with little, if any, success, and he thought any Indian State would similarly have little success.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS said that the War Office had no objection to the grant of these 15-pr. guns to Indian States.LORD CURZON said that he had objected to the grant of artillery to Indian States, but on different grounds from those which had been put forward. Reference had been made to the Mutiny and to the fact that Indian Chiefs would feel resentment if they thought their prestige was being impaired by their requests being refused. Surely this argument would apply to any proposal they put forward to the Viceroy which was refused. He himself considered that the real question was of a more speculative nature, namely, what was the future going to be in India ? Was it certain that the loyalty of the Chiefs was going to remain as complete in the future as it had been in the past&apos;? If so, it would be a good thing to increase their power. It was a question, however, whether this state of affairs would continue. There were forces at work in India now undermining the British position, and the Chiefs must be pondering whether loyalty to the British Raj in the future would be the best course for them to adopt. The Chiefs realised that the agitation in India was spreading into their own States, and that though they might feel that their future depended on their loyalty to us yet they must also debate the other side of the picture. It seemed to him that, should a big convulsion one day take place in the East, some among the Chiefs might be driven to consider the advisability of deserting Britain. There was bound to be progress in the demand for modern equipment: if it were the right thing to do to trust to the loyalty of the Chiefs, then it was right to increase their strength, but the perils of this step should not be overlooked. On the other hand, the fact that the Viceroy, the India Council, the Commander-in-Chief in India, General Birdwood, the Secretary of State for India, the Secretary of State for War, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff all supported the proposal rendered it in his opinion exceedingly difficult to oppose it.LORD BIRKENHEAD said that he saw no reason why the Indian Chiefs, either now or during the course of the next twenty or thirty years, should consider it advantageous to desert us; he thought they realised their best policy would be to support the British Government. As regards the question of aeroplanes which had been raised, he agreed with the Air Ministry in considering that this question should be postponed as long as possible. He would discourage the issue of aeroplanes to Indian Chiefs, but he was not alarmed at the prospect of then-having aeroplanes. The difficulties with regard to personnel and material would be almost insuperable.
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, February 6, 1925.THE COMMITTEE agreed to reaffirm to the Cabinet their previous recom-mendation That 15-pr. guns should be issued to selected Indian States, subject to the following provisos which are set forth more fully in C.I.D. Paper No. 136-D:-(a.) Only selected States should be supplied with 15-pr. guns, and the proportion of artillery to other arms in those States should not be higher than in the British Army, and the control of the supply of ammunition should rest with the Government of India.(&amp;.) The implication should be avoided that the pattern of artillery which has last been rejected by the Regular forces should successively be conceded to selected States.(c.) The Government of India should be informed of the reasons which have induced His Majesty&apos;s Government to sanction the issue of 15-pr. guns to Indian States, and that the arguments put forward by the Government of India which might suggest the grant of field artillery of the latest pattern are not endorsed.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER wished his dissent from this recommendation to be recorded.* * * * * *
