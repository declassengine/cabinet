[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.] ^ 9Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1925.SECRET.O.P. 146 (25).CABINET.HOUSE OF LORDS REFORM.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor. I.At the Conference of the National Unionist Association, held at Newcastle-on-Tyne in October last, the following resolution was passed unanimously : &quot; That it is urgently necessary that the powers and composition of the Second Chamber should be so modified as to ensure that no far-reaching change in the law or Constitution of the country can be made by the House of Commons alone without the expressed assent of the electorate.&quot;It is plain from the above resolution, and from recent correspondence in the Press, that the question will shortly be brought forward for discussion in Parliament,, and it is desirable that we should as soon as possible face the problems which will arise, and consider how they may be solved.It may be said that, at a time when the reputation of the House of Lords stands high and when there is no popular agitation against it, it is not for Conservatives and Unionists to make proposals for change; but the answer is clear. By virtue of the Parliament Act, a Bill which has been certified by the Speaker of the House of Commons to be a Money Bill cannot be either amended or rejected by the House of Lords; and any other Bill- including a Bill making radical changes in the Constitu-tion if passed three times by the House of Commons, even in a single Parliament,, must, though rejected by the House of Lords, be submitted for the Royal Assent. Such a state of things differs little from single-Chamber government, and it is-natural that all those who have the future of the country at heart should desire it to be altered; and if the powers of the House of Lords are to be strengthened, it will apparently be necessary to revise its constitution at the same time. It may be doubted whether any House of Commons would in these days join in enlarging the authority of a Second Chamber consisting mainly of members who sit by right of succession only, and, if so, powers and constitution must be- dealt with together.I propose to consider first the question of the powers of the House of Lords, andl afterwards to deal with its composition.. II.&apos;  &apos;As to Money Bills, it is probably useless to expect that the House of Commons, however constituted, will consent to abandon its paramount control over Bills of a purely financial character; but the provision of the Parliament Act, which leaves the decision as to what Bills are of that character to the Speaker of the House of Commons alone, is plainly indefensible. Our Speakers may be models of judgment and fairmindedness, but they are human beings, and it is not right that a question upon which the two Houses may well have divergent views should be committed absolutely to the decision of the President of one of them. The Bryce Conference recognised the justice of this view, and recommended that the question whether a Bill is or is not purely financial should be dealt with by a Joint Standing Committee of the two Houses, not to exceed in number seven members from each House, and to be set up at the beginning of each Parliament. &quot; Such an arrangement,&quot; they said, [12815] &apos; b
&quot; for deciding these delicate questions seemed preferable to that contained in the Parliament Act, which does not cover all the cases likely to arise, and which places on the Speaker responsibilities with which it is. not desirable to load an office whoso perfect impartiality everyone desires to preserve.&quot; , They added a recommendation that Bills and provisions dealing with local rates should not be held to fall within the category of financial Bills or financial provisions, and that the Second Chamber should have power to deal with matters affecting local rates. These proposals, which have received the sanction of a Conference upon which both Houses and all parties were represented, might well be accepted as a settlement of this part of the question.In this connection a further observation may be made. The privilege by which the House of Commons claims that any financial provision, though contained in a Bill dealing with the general law, shall not be amended by the House of Lords, has recently been pushed very far; and the Lords have on several occasions felt somewhat aggrieved by the large and increasing claims made by the other House under the plea of privilege. It would be an advantage if. the jurisdiction of the proposed Joint Standing Committee were made to extend to questions of privilege of this kind.III.The question next to be considered is, what should be the powers of the Second Chamber in respect of Bills other than Money Bills, and how differences between the two Houses with regard to such Bills should be adjusted. Upon this point the recommendation of the Bryce Conference was that a Bill accepted by one House and rejected by the other should on the demand of either House be referred to a Free Conference consisting of thirty members of each House to be nominated by the Committees of Selection; that as to any Bill so referred the Free Conference should report to both Houses with regard to a suggested basis of agreement, and it both Houses agreed to the-Bill as reported by the Free Conference, it should be submitted for the Royal Assent; that if either House dissented from the Bill so reported, it should be again referred to the Free Conference in the next following session; and that if the Free Conference then reported that it had accepted the Bill in the same form by a majority of not less than three, the Bill, if then approved by both Houses or by the House of Commons alone, should be presented to His Majesty for the Royal Assent. . These proposals mark an advance in the right direction; but they leave untouched the main defect in the present system, for they would still leave it in the power of the House of Commons in the last resort to pass a Bill from which the Lords dissented. This is the central point in the controversy, and if a solution is to be reached it must in some way be dealt with.How then, when the two Houses obstinately differ with regard to any Bill, should the difference be adjusted or determined ? For myself, I have found no satisfactory answer to this question other than the application to such cases of the system of Referendum or Poll of the People. The main function of a Second Chamber, as defined by the Bryce Report, is &apos;&apos; the interposition of so much delay (and no more) in the passing of a Bill into law as may be needed to enable the opinion of the nation to be adequately expressed upon it.&quot; This definition may be accepted as being in agreement with the modern view of the functions of a Second Chamber; but the proposals of the Bryce Conference make no provision for ascertaining the opinion of the nation, while the adoption of the Referendum would provide a means of eliciting that opinion, and would make it the final arbiter between the two Houses.The Bryce Conference considered the Referendum, but a majority of the Conference rejected it on grounds which were stated as follows : &quot;The majority of the Conference, however, did not approve this plan on the ground (among others) that the use of the Referendum once introduced could not be confined to the cases for which it was in this instance proposed; that it might tend to lower the authority and dignity of Parliament; and that it was unsuited to the conditions of a large country, and especially of the United Kingdom, for different parts of which different legislation is sometimes required.&quot;With deference to the members of the Conference who took this view, it does not appear to me that their objections have sufficient force to outweigh the arguments in favour of the Referendum. The Referendum can and should be confined by statute to cases of obstinate and irreconcilable difference between the two Houses; and, if so confined, it would surely not be more injurious to the dignity of Parliament than the
I 3.spectacle of one House overriding the other. As to the objection that different legislation may be required for different parts of the United Kingdom, the answer is that proposals for legislation affecting a part only of the Kingdom are constantly dealt with by a Parliament drawn from all its parts, and it is not clear why such proposals could not with equal safety be submitted to the whole body of electors. In my view, the proposals of the Bryce Report as to the reference of a disputed Bill to a Free Conference in the first instance, and as to its reference back to such a Conference in the event of a second disagreement, might well be accepted; but, if on the second reference, the Free Conference again reports in favour of the Bill as so referred, the Bill should, at the request of either House, be submitted to the electors for a Referendum vote.IV.When we come to discuss the future constitution of the Second Chamber, we find the ground covered by an embarrassing mass of proposals. The Select Committee appointed by the House of Lords in 1907, over which Lord Rosebery presided, reported in favour of a House of about 350 members, consisting (apart from peers of the Blood Royal and spiritual and legal peers) of persons &apos;&apos; qualified &apos;&apos; by holding or having held certain specified public offices, together with 200 representative peers to be elected by the general body of hereditary peers for each Parliament. To these were to be added life peers, of wrhom the Sovereign was to be empowered to create not more than four in each year and not more than 40 in all. The Second Chamber Conference appointed by the Prime Minister in 1917, over which Lord Bryce presided, approved a Second Chamber, consisting (in addition to the legal members) of two sections, of which the first was to consist of 246 persons elected by panels of Members of the House of Commons distributed in certain geographical groups, and the second (which was to number about one-fourth of the whole Chamber) of persons, chosen by a Joint Standing Committee of both Houses appointed for this purpose.. These elections were to be for twelve years, and one-third of the members elected were to retire in every fourth year. The persons elected by the Joint Standing Committee were to be chosen from the hereditary peers and bishops in the first instance, and at the second and third elections one-half of the persons elected were to be so chosen; but after the third election the choice of the Joint Standing Committee was to be unrestricted, except that the number of peers and bishops sitting in the Second Chamber on the nomination of that Committee was not to fall below thirty. The Coalition Government of 1922 put forward resolutions under which the House was to be composed, in addition to peers of the Blood Royal, Lords spiritual and Law Lords, of (a) members elected either directly or indirectly from the outside; (b) hereditary peers elected by their order; and (c) members nominated by the Crown, the number in each case to be determined by statute. These proposals left many points undetermined, and it is understood that the Cabinet of that day was not all of one mind upon them. The proposals made by private persons, either in Parlia-mentary Bills or in the Press, are infinite in their number and variety, and they need not be here referred to in detail.Before deciding upon any particular scheme, it is necessary to Come to a decision on certain general questions, of which the most important are as follows : 1. Should the new Second Chamber be directly elected by a popular vote? To this question all the authorities quoted give a negative reply; and the reason for this consensus of opinion is well stated in the following paragraph of the Bryce Report: &quot; On the other hand, it was forcibly urged that a Chamber elected on the same franchise as the Bouse of Commons would inevitably become a rival of the House of Commons, and would, because it had an equal &quot;mandate &quot; from the people, be likely to claim equal financial powers, and tend to fall into conflict with that principle of the Constitution which assigns to the House of Commons the function of making and unmaking Administrations. Ministers would have two masters to serve and to fear. The persons directly elected would be presumably of the same general type as those elected to the House of Commons, so that no new element such as is admittedly desirable would thereby be introduced into the Legis-lature. The Second Chamber would in fact be little more than a duplicate of the House of Commons, and might either, as being the [12815] b 2
less attractive body, come to be composed mainly of the surplus material of the latter, or (alternatively) by the longer tenure of its members become ultimately the more attractive, possibly the more influential legislative body. The constituencies which would have to be created for a comparatively small body such, as the new Second Chamber would be so\much larger than the constituencies which now elect members to the House of Commons, that they would be more readily controlled by party organisations. As the expense of con-testing these larger constituencies would also be heavier, an advantage &apos;   would thus be given to wealthy candidates.&quot;To this it may be added that many men well fitted by character and experience to be useful members of a Second Chamber would certainly decline to incur the toil and expense of a contested election. Should the hereditary peerage be represented in the new Chamber? &apos; To this question the reply has generally been in the affirmative; and, indeed, it would be contrary to British feeling and traditions to destroy at one stroke a privilege which is ingrained in our history and which has been used upon the whole to the advantage of the nation. But as to the extent of the representation which&apos; should be given to the hereditary peerage, there is a wide difference of opinion, the Rosebery Committee proposing that the House shall be constituted wholly of peers, while under the Bryce Report the number of hereditary peers entitled to seats would at once be reduced to eighty-two, and in a few years to thirty. Should the holding of certain high offices of State entitle a peer to a seat in the House of Lords during his life \ This proposal, which was endorsed by the Rosebery Committee, has not gained much favour. There would be great difficulty in agreeing upon a list of qualifying offices, and the qualities which lead to appointment to an office of State are not always those which are most to be desired in a member of a Legislative Chamber. The really qualified peers would undoubtedly be chosen under any system of indirect election or nomination. Should the Second Chamber contain an element not consisting of peers ? I am convinced that this is to be desired. So long as membership of the Upper House is confined to peers, it is impossible that the Labour Party should be adequately represented; and this involves a grave loss perhaps a danger to the House and to the country. A &quot; breath of fresh air &quot; from outside would be of real value to the House of Lords.If these conclusions are accepted, it would seem to follow that the new Second Chamber should consist, in addition to the peers of the Blood Royal, the spiritual peers (in reduced number) and the legal peers, of two sections, of which the first would consist of peers representing their order, and the second of members appointed from outside; and I proceed to consider how the members of these two sections should be chosen.&apos; V.As to the representative peers, the proposal generally made is that they should be chosen by the general body of peers, either (as in Scotland) for each Parliament or (as in Ireland) for life, or for some fixed period, such as the period of twelve years recommended by the Bryce Conference. If this proposal is adopted, it would be well that the United Kingdom should for this purpose be divided into districts, such as Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and Monmouthshire, and the eleven English districts mentioned in the Table annexed to the Bryce Report, the peers resident in each district electing a specified number of representative peers. This would ensure the due representation of every part of the country. Peers of Scotland and Ireland would be eligible, as well as peers of the United Kingdom and (probably) peeresses in their own right. The position of the peers connected with Southern Ireland and not holding peerages of the United Kingdom would require special consideration.An alternative proposal is that the representative peers should be chosen by the county and county borough: councils, or by panels or electoral colleges representing groups of those bodies; and there are strong arguments imfavour of that suggestion. The county representatives would be well acquainted with the qualifications and
i ck o r6 (C (public services of the peers resident in their districts, and the position of the chosen peers would be strengthened by the consciousness that they had the support and represented the interests of their neighbours. Further, the prospect of election as a representative peer would, in the case of some of the younger peers, furnish an additional incentive to public service.The proposal of the Bryce Conference that the representative peers should be chosen by the Members of Parliament grouped in a certain way has not found much support.Peers not elected to the House of Lords should have the parliamentary vote and be eligible for the House of Commons.VI.As to the contingent of non-peers, direct election being excluded, the choice appears to be between indirect election and nomination by the Crown.If indirect election is preferred, it might be made by county and county borough councils, or electoral colleges representing groups of those bodies in manner suggested above with reference to the representative peers. There is little real danger that, by conferring upon a county council the duty once in every four years of choosing (directly or through its delegates), a few persons to sit in the Second Chamber, party politics would be introduced into county elections, where they have now no place.The alternative method of nomination by the Crown has considerable support. The suggestion is that the Sovereign should be empowered within a limited time after each general election to appoint a fixed number of persons to be members of the Second Chamber for that Parliament. This proposal was made by Lord St. Aldwyn to the Select Committee of 1907, and was supported by a strong minority of that Committee; and it has many advantages. The appointment would of course be made on the advice of the Government of the day, which would reflect the views then dominant in the House of Commons. A Labour Government would naturally recommend for appointment a substantial number of members of the Labour Party, including Labour Ministers; while a Conservative or Liberal Government, being already well represented in the House of Lords, might well be more catholic in its choice. The list of persons so appointed might comprise representatives of the Dominions (subject to their consent) and of the unestablished Churches and learned societies.The number of members of the House of Lords not being peers would need careful consideration. The nominated members should not exceed from 30 to 50, as the appointment of a very large number at the commencement of each new Parliament might unduly load the scale in favour of the Government of the day; but if the method of indirect election is adopted, the number so chosen might be larger.The methods of election and nomination could of course be combined.VII.It may be objected to all the above proposals that the number of representative peers and of elected or nominated members of the House of Lords being fixed, the effect will be to destroy the time-honoured check upon that body, namely, the power of the Sovereign to create peers without limit. This objection could be met by empowering the Sovereign to confer life peerages. It was an unhappy day for the House of Lords when in the year 1856 the Committee of Privileges decided that Sir James Parke, who had been created a peer &quot; for and during the term of his natural life,&quot; was not entitled to sit and vote in Parliament. Since that date many men of distinction have refused a peerage because they had no means by which the dignity could be supported after their deaths, or no son to whom they would wish it to pass; and some peers of distinction have been succeeded by less worthy descendants. Life peerages should confer the right to sit, and there should be no limit to their number.VIII.Having now dealt generally with the questions which call for solution, I venture, without dogmatising as to the answers which should be given to them, to suggest that the new House of Lords should consist, in addition to the ex officio members (Princes of the Blood Royal and legal  and spiritual peers),  of   about  30O
representative peers chosen in either of the two methods described above and about thirty additional members (or Senators) nominated by the Crown in each Parliament. To these life peers might from time to time be added. This proposal may be thought to be unduly Conservative; but it is founded on the existing Constitution, it would produce an effective Second Chamber, and it is simple and could be easily explained. In framing any scheme it is necessary to bear in mind that the country does not. love sudden and drastic changes, and that no change can be made (except under the Parliament Act) without the-consent of the House of Lords.A further question will require to be considered,&quot; namely, whether House of Lords Reform can be proposed in the present Parliament. It will be said that, a popular mandate having been obtained for the Parliament Act, a proposal for an amendment of that Act should in like manner be submitted to the electors at a General Election; but this would involve delay, as no one wants a general election in the near future. I am disposed to think that it will, be necessary for the Government to take some action not later than next year. Possibly the best course would be to proceed at first by resolution, and so to ascertain what measure of agreement can be obtained.-    -    . . . . :       . &apos;       -    rm^r- C.March 16, 1925.o
