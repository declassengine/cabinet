[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. j(Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.) -SECRET.CP. Ill (25). (Also C.I.D. 592 B.)Protocol for the pacific Settlement of International Disputes.I circulate a copy of a telegram received from the Government of India giving their views on the provisions of the Geneva Protocol.birkenhead.23rd February 1925.Telegram from Government of India, Foreign and Political Department,dated .18th February 1925.678. Geneva Protocol. While in full sympathy with its objects, we regard Protocol, in its present form, at any rate, as impracticable and dangerous from standpoint of Empire as a whole and of India especially. Papers received make it clear that former aspect has already been adequately presented. We confine our comments, therefore, strictly to latter.Proposals regarding arbitration, determination of aggressor and armistice may conceivably be workable and effective as between highly organised nations. India, however, has dealings with nations loosely organised, and incapable of appreciating or working the complicated machinery for delaying or preventing hostilities. It, would clearly handicap India gravely to have to abide strictly by rigorous obligations under the Protocol which her less civilised antagonist would not and perhaps could not fulfil. On the crucial portion of our frontier we have a tribal belt nominally ours, but responsive, especially during periods of tension, to Afghan intrigue, which would make any such arrangements as are contemplated by the Protocol impossible of application to our relations with Afghanistan. Afghan interpretation of an armistice in 1919, when Afghanistan held back its army, yet incited our tribes (potentially more formidable than any Afghan army), throws India&apos;s peculiar position into clear relief. Insidious hostility in this form would hardly be susceptible of proof to satisfaction of a distant Council unversed in our frontier problems. Even if it were, what control could a body of men in Geneva exert on forces in actual contact somewhere in the neighbourhood of our borders ? In such a conflict, with Afghanistan disregarding the League&apos;s orders, there would be no one to enforce them except India. Under this part of the Protocol India clearly would have much to risk and nothing to gain.Conclusion is the same when we examine the question of sanctions. InchVs geographical position, her maintenance of a standing army mark her down as the nation on which the League, under the Protocol, would ordinarily call, to apply immediate pressure against recalcitrant State in the East. But Hindu India&apos;s theoretical sympathy with the League of Nations would change to strong resentment if we attempted to place India&apos;s army under the orders of the League, whilst Moslem opinion, already inclined to regard the League as combination of Christian Powers and potential menace to Islam, might, in circumstances easily conceived, render it politically imprudent, and, indeed, perhaps impossible, to comply with a call from the League to use India&apos;s army against a Moslem State. If we turn to the Far East, the intolerable burden of potential obligations the Protocol would place on India becomes even more&apos; apparent. If Japan were declared the aggressor, owing, say, to , encroachments on China, foremost, and in effect perhaps alone, among the signatory., States on which the Council would call to apply the sanctions under Article 11 would be Great Britain and India towing to their &quot; geographical position and particular situation as regards armaments.&quot; This test case seems to demonstrate finally inapplicability to the East of a,\Protoeol designed, primarily for European continent requirements.Even though circumstances may be conceived in which it would be possible to -utilise India&apos;s forces for the settlement of a foreign quarrel, we doubt whether we should be justified in applying Indian revenues to defray the cost, as is apparently contemplated under the Protocol, more especially as anticipated recovery of cost from the defeated aggressor would, be altogether visionary in the case, at any rate, of countries like Persia or Afghanistan.Faced as she is by a loosely organised Afghanistan, and with Russia standing-out, India would clearly not be justified in subscribing to any disarmament proposals.179a      100   2.25
