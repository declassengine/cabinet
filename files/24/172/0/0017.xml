CIRCUIT COURTS AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ^III &apos; * &quot;        &quot;&quot;*&quot; - &apos; . i. ^I C.P. 117 (25),. (SCOTLAND) DRAFT BILL. &apos;\ moMDM BJ TBE SECRETARY&quot; FOR SCOTLAND.The genesis of the attached draft Bill is to be found in I questions which arose as to the necessity for continuing the Sheriff i Oourt House at Inveraray, Argyllshire,This Oourt House -is available for sittings both of the High Court of Justiciary on Circuit and of the Sheriff Court, but no 1 civil or criminal business has been transacted in the Sheriff Court I since 1919. and the last sitting of.the High Court there was in 1908. iIn these circumstances there appeared to be no sufficient reason for I the continuance of the Court House which involved the payment of I considerable maintenance expenses by Exchequer.     The Secretary for Scotland can by Order provide for the discontinuance of the Sheriff Court but the High Court are bound by statute to arrango for the 1 holding of Circuit Courts at Inveraray if there are any. oases and accordingly it is impossible to discontinue the Court House without amendment of the statute referred to.The possibility of legislation was, therefore, considered land the conclusion reached was that it. would be desirable, if any legislation were introduced, to take the opportunity of consolidating land improving existing enactments relating to the holding of Circuit. I Courts of Justiciary.1 The Court of Justiciary under this Bill will have more orI less complete freedom in fixing the times and places of Circuit Courts land there will be no statutory impediment to the discontinuance of ithe Court House at Inveraray.Opportunity has at the same time boon taken to make certain amendments in the criminal procedure code designed to facilitate and expedite proceedings.Authority for the introduction of a practically identical Bill wan obtained by ny predecessor last year.     The Bill was introduced m the House of Lords and passed through its stages there without amendment or controversy; &quot;but did not &quot;make further progress.IUnless objection should be taken, On grounds of sentiment iW uf^i to *ho abolition of the Circuit Court at Inveraray, * x   jxi 3&quot;0^1* prove non-contentious   and I ask authority for its introduction in the House of Lords with a view to its passing this oes3ion if no serious opposition should arise.&quot;JOHN GILMOUR1.fflottish Office,1   Whitehall, S.W.1.
