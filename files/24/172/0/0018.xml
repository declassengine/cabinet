How to achieve it can then be considered in its turn.   What dowe want ?   We want to save ourselves from being involved in another Armageddon,victory in which would Compass our ruin scarcely less surely than defeat.   Never-theless, if such a struggle comes shall we be safer fighting in it Or standing our ?What is the cause which brings this dread possibility and choice before our minds ? It is the quarrel between France and Germany. This antagonism; which has lasted through centuries, is uhappeased. All the minor feuds Of Europe group themselves around it. Everyone fears that it may lead to another World conflict. No one at any rate feels any assurance that it will not. We feel that we are deeply involved in this quarrel. Though we do not share its hatreds, though we cannot control its occasions, though all our interests and desires are to avoid it, we may irresistibly be drawn in. But this frightful possibility is happily some considerable way off.. Germany is prostrate. In an age when lethal apparatus is almost everything she is disarmed At the worst there is a breathing space, measured by decades. Our problem is how to use this breathing space to end the quarrel.   That problem dominates all others.Even if we saw clearly how to stop the quarrel we might not be able to carry out our policy. We have, therefore, to seek not so much for the perfect way but for a practical way, the individual steps along which are unquestionably in our power. We have to seek a way which will not commit us beyond the limits of human foresight. It would be a great advantage if we could find a way which, even if it failed to stop the quarrel, did not necessarily commit us to a struggle in which we should almost certainly be defeated. No one will pretend that the affairs of nations can be conducted without many risks, or that any policy is free from uncertainty and danger. But certainly one would not be in a hurry in this rapidly changing world to bind one&apos;s self and to bind one&apos;s children to the obligation of fighting a disastrous war, the outbreak of which would occur through the working of forces outside our control.Two plans have been suggested for stopping the new war between France and Germany. The first is a plan for elaborate paper declarations by an International Council at Geneva forbidding it to happen. Even this already ambitious hope is: further weighted by a vast super-structure of general declarations to forbid all wars and settle all quarrels. The second plan is that England and France should join together to over-awe Germany, and that England should exact as a condition of her alliance with France that France should cease to harry and anger Germany. This is a much more practicable plan than the first. If union meant security in peace and victory in war the case would be complete. But if it seemed probable [12731!        &apos; **...........!...............____________________________.......mnnwnna.
that England and Prance, in spite of standing together, would both be defeated by Germany on the mainland of Europe, it would not be much good. England, France and Russia were, indeed, an apparent counterpoise to the German power. England, France and the United States might also be a counterpoise. But England and France alone, with Belgium thrown in, is a combination which does not inspire much confidence so far as war on the Continent is concerned.We have to contemplate a situation in which Germany: will be rearmed either with existing military appliances or with new inventions. It is probable that such a process can only be accomplished gradually. Therefore one would expect that France would attack Germany at some moment before the process of rearming was complete. Do we wish to bind ourselves to march with her in such an attack; or are we to bind ourselves only to come to her aid when Germany thinks herself strong enough to attack when if Germany is ripe and we are already too late ? No doubt pur pact would be phrased to involve us only in the case of deliberate aggression by Germany a German invasion of French or Belgian soil. But this is the contingency least likely to occur. Far more probable is the steady revival of German military strength causing increasing terror in France, or alternatively German aggression against Poland which France would interpret as a compulsion to war. Therefore by making a pact we might range ourselves against Germany without over-aweing her, and yet when the struggle came, with all its inexorable consequences, we might not feel ourselves bound by treaty or sentiment to come in. In this case we should certainly encounter the hostility of whoever was the victors. On the other hand, if we held back from attacking Germany until Germany was really strong, we should condemn ourselves to participate in a disastrous enterprise. All these possibilities ought to be profoundly searched before we commit ourselves.Have we any alternative ? It is argued that we could never endure the possession of the Channel ports by a victorious Germany, i.e., by the greatest European military Power. We dwelt, however, for centuries when these same Channel ports were in the possession of the greatest European military Power, and when that Power France was almost unceasingly hostile to us. It is said that the new weapons of war aggravate the danger. But that depends on who has the best and most powerful weapons. If, in addition to sea superiority we had air supremacy, we might maintain ourselves as we did in the days of Napoleon for indefinite periods, even when all the Channel ports and all the Low Countries were in the hands of a vast hostile military Power. It should never be admitted in this argument that England cannot, if the worst comes to the worst, stand alone. I decline to accept as an axiom that our fate is involved in that of France.If therefore we have, as I believe, a choice, however grim, in the matter, ought we not to utilise that freedom to the full ? Ought we not to use it in the way and at the time most calculated to achieve our primary object, viz., the prevention of the renewal of a Franco-German war ? For the next ten or fifteen years France will be the strongest Power in Europe. She will be able to over-run Germany before we can bring any appreciable military forces to her aid. Shall we have more influence over her during this period if we are bound to her or if we are independent of her in a treaty sense ? Would she be likely sensibly to mitigate her rigours towards Germany for the sake of any military aid she can expect from us during the period of her strength ? Would she be justified in abandoning her strategic advantages on the Rhine for the sake of receiving a few British divisions in the first few months of a war ? Should we not have just as great an influence, or perhaps an even greater influence, over her if we had still to be won, if she had still at every stage to convince us of her own rectitude and moderation and of the approach of growing danger ? It may be that as the German power revives and the French power sinks relatively, France will turn to Britain with an ever greater appeal. I cannot tell how soon this period will be reached; but that it has not yet been reached is certain. The contemptuous rejection by Poincare and all the French forces he represents of our offer at Cannes convinces me that these are not days when France is willing to subordinate her own interests and ambitions to the cooler and more detached viewpoint of England. She would like to have England bound to her by treaty and as a make-weight behind her, and no doubt would make certain concessions in her treatment of Germany to secure us. But she does not regard our aid as essential to her safety; she is counting far more on her own army, her black troops, her relations
with Poland and, above all, on her strategic situation on the Rhine, than on the latent, tardy, if ultimately vast, forces which the British Empire could command.I feel therefore that we have not got sufficient bargaining power and leverage-; at the present time to procure any decisive modification of French policy as the price of a British guarantee. At any rate it is by standing aloof and not by offering ourselves that we shall ascertain the degree of importance which France really attaches ,to, our troth. Does anyone suppose that a British signature to a pact related only to the Western theatre would induce France to withdraw from the Rhine and evacuate Germany ? Before she would do that she would require definite engagements in respect of numbers of troops and dates of arrival of a kind sufficient at least to compensate for the solid advantages she is asked to surrender. At the most she would consent to the evacuation of the first of the zones fixed by the treaty. The German grievance would continue unassuaged, and we should have squandered finally our bargaining power. We should have entered into dire obligations for the sake only of a partial and insufficient relief. For these reasons, among others, I cannot feel that this is a moment for a pact with France. I am sure we would do better, for the present at any rate, to keep ourselves free.We must, however, have a policy which can be publicly expressed and explained to everyone. Might we not then hold the following language to France: &quot;We feel that your relations with Germany are at present too bitter for us to involve ourselves in the quarrel. Moreover, Germany is disarmed and you are strong. You are therefore not in any immediate danger. These are the years in which you have the opportunity of establishing much better relations with Germany, and so rendering a renewal of war less likely. We will do everything in our power to promote these improved relations. The better friends you are with Germany, the better friends we shall be with you. The more you can settle your, quarrel with Germany, the more ready we shall be to associate ourselves with your fortunes in the event of all your efforts proving unavailing, If at any time you approach a real state of peace with Germany, we would be willing to come in in order to achieve, consolidate and render unbreakable that peace. We do not underrate the difficulties. We do not abandon our mistrust of Germany. You know well, as M. Poincare has reminded you, where some at least of our main interests lie. But it rests with you to accomplish the first part of the task; it rests with you to create that atmosphere in which Germany will have the least possible incentive to renew the war, and thereafter it may be our part to join with you in increasing the deterrents against her hostile action. We might well be partners in a genuine triple accord between England, France and Germany. Apart from such a triple accord, we cannot enter into specific obligations towards you. We can only watch the situation in the same spirit of hatred of aggression, of a respect for public law, which, together with our own national interests, led us to your side in 1914.&quot;I have only tried to set down thoughts, and not to find the diplomatic terms and forms in which the policy should be expressed. I believe that proceeding on these lines we should exert the maximum influence upon France, and that after a passing ebullition against us and Germany, and possibly a detachment from us for some years,: she would come back in a far better mood. Meanwhile, we should not have cast away ineffectually what may be our one great lever to procure a general peace. I question, however, whether any alternative policy is really possible. I doubt whether in present circumstances the British people would be willing to accept definite obligations to France. Certainly to persuade them would require a great campaign of argument. The whole of this argument would dwell upon the possibility of what Lord Balfour calls &quot; Armageddon No. 2.&quot; Such an argument occupying the public mind would keep all thoughts on war and arouse great anxieties. It will delay the return to normal conditions. Very likely in the end we should not be able to carry an agreement. On all grounds, therefore, I rest upon the formula : &quot; When France has made a real peace with Germany, Britain will seal the bond with all her strength.&quot;w. s. c.February 24, 1925.
