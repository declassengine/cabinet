(Final Copy.)CABINET.FORESIGHT AMD CO-ORDINATION IN ECONOMIC ENQUIRY.Note by the Prime Minister.THE following memorandum has been prepared in the Treasury by my instructions, and embodies a suggestion which has for some time been present to. my mind for a Standing Committee, analogous to the Committee of Imperial Defence, whose function will be to examine, from the point of view Of ascertained and ascertainable economic data, proposals of policy, potential as well as actual. The formulation and decision of policy is a matter for the Cabinet. The business of this Committee (as is the case with the Defence Committee) would be to ensure that all the material facts and information at the disposal of the Government Service are made available in practical form for use by the Cabinet in reaching its conclusions. I am sure that my colleagues will agree with me in my view that there is room in spheres other than that of national defence for a body similar to the Committee of Imperial Defence, and that the precedent of the latter Committee provides an assurance that the labours of such a body Will be invaluable to the Government.(Initialled) J. R. M.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1, June 30, 1924.Treasury Memorandum.Foresight and Co-ordination in Economic Enquiry.1. Experience of the problems, both of the war and of the post-war period, has demonstrated the necessity for connected exploration of economic tendencies as a preliminary to the formulation of Govei-nment policy. That exploration may proceed upon various lines, but the part that official statistics must play in the majority of such surveys becomes increasingly predominant. The complexity of modem problems and the new aspects given to them by the present abnormal economic conditions call for fuller knowledge of the underlying and surrounding facts. It has been said, with much force, that in this age most political and social problems are at bottom economic, and most economic problems are at bottom statistical.2. In many proposals for change, or the resistance of change, controversy and difference of view are inevitable, and, indeed, frequently healthy. Experience has shown, however, the abundant advantage of confining such differences so far as possible to the principles involved and of having for the common use a body of material facts so collected as to be beyond suspicion of any party. Where con-troversy exists as to the adequacy, fairness or accuracy of facts and statistics compiled by bodies which, to one section of the community or another, must appear as partisan, the search for economic truth is made unduly difficult. The superiority of official statistics over all privately collected facts as a basis for practical State economics, from this point of view can hardly be gainsaid, and the responsibility of the State for the timely provision of material appropriate to [11775b]
current problems, where the State has special facilities not otherwise available to individuals, is forcing itself upon public notice. There is, therefore, over and above the question of the pursuance of economic enquiry for State purposes, the further question of the publication in appropriate instances of its statistical results and of the publication of official statistics bearing upon the treatment of matters of public importance in the economic or social sphere outside the immediate limits of Government action. The increasing consciousness of the importance of economic and statistical knowledge has, for example, found expression in recent writings and speeches of the Prime Minister,* Mr. Baldwin,! Lord Salisbury^ and Sir Leo Chiozza Money,! emphasising the importance and the comparative paucity of statistics dealing with the division of the product of industry and with the distribution of the national income. It is reflected also in the general tenour of the Petition which was prepared by a Committee of the Royal Statistical Society, signed by a number of economists, statisticians, business men and others, and presented to the Government in November 1919, although many of the individual statements in the Petition proved on examination to be misconceived.3. No occasion has occurred since the armistice to make any detailed review of the methods adopted in individual Departments for pursuing economic as distinct from statistical enquiries, but of course the Departments principally concerned possess upon their establishments economists available for enquiries  either continuous or ad hoc which the functions of a Department throw up. The methods of collection and presentation of official statistics, on the other hand, have recently been the subject of a general survey. The statistical field is a wide one, inasmuch as, in addition to administrative statistics produced for immediate purposes of State administration, other statistics, sometimes termed informative statistics, have long been habitually prepared and published as a basis of public information on matters affecting the welfare and progress of the community.4. The review referred to was carried out by the Committee on the Collection and Presentation of Official Statistics a Committee, which was appointed by the then Cabinet, sat under the chairmanship of Sir Alfred Watson and reported in February 1921.h This report recalls that no Government responsibility has been accepted in this country for the provision of statistics relating to the whole life and activities of the nation, and that the body of existing official statistics is to a great extent the product of&apos; accidental evolution. The report mentions that the provision of informative as distinct from administrative-statistics has been subject at all times to certain conditions of which the following are the chief: (i.) The purpose to be served must be recognised to be of definite national value.(ii.) The cost must be reasonable in relation to that purpose, i.e., it must be such as Parliament may properly be asked to sanction, regard being had to the general financial position of the country.(iii.) The enquiries necessary to the collection of the material for the desired statistics must not be such as to excite irritation and resentment among those from whom the information has to be obtained; and, in close relation to this point.(iv.) If compulsory powers are required, these powers must be such as Parlia-ment may be willing to grant, and the action to be taken under them such as Parliament will approve.5. Alike in relation to economic enquiry for Government purposes whether proceeding from statistical research or pursued in other ways and in relation to the publication of informative official statistics as a basis of knowledge and action outside the sphere of Government, it will be found that subject to an exception which will be mentioned in a later paragraph of this notelf there has not yet been established any definite or considered machinery of co-operation between* 1923.

C (? obo 4separate Departments, either for laying down subjects requiring economic study, for thinking out the proper lines of development of regular Government statistics, for their systematic co-ordination, for the collation and mutual interpretation of related statistics gathered by separate Departments, or for the occasional promotion of ad hoc statistical enquiry in matters in which regular presentation or collection is unnecessary or undesirable. These matters have in general been left upon the tacit assumption that informal co-operation will be arranged from time to time as circumstances may require.6. But if it be granted that economic foresight and adequate statistical knowledge are essential requisites both for the initiation of Government action in new spheres (either positive, in the prosecution of proposals for change, or, what is perhaps equally important, negative action in resisting or criticising suggested innovations) and for the progress of public knowledge and the better adjustment of the social and industrial scheme, this assumption is not watertight.7. Where economic problems hang upon the fringe between the territories of different Departments they may not be fully envisaged by any, and where economic enquiry needs to be pursued primarily on a statistical basis administrative statistics which may be of the first importance to the Minister of one Department in the framing of policies may be available or obtainable in another Department, but, in the absence of some regular co-ordinating machinery, the knowledge of the need and of the possibility of its satisfaction may not come together, at any rate at a sufficiently early stage in the development of a scheme of action.8. In the case of informative statistics, the need for co-ordination is present in at least an equal degree. It is probably true of many Departments it could hardly fail to be true of some that sources of informative statistics continually cross the path of the Minister&apos;s duties, but do not run along it. By a deviation he may secure a valuable addition to knowledge. It may happen that that deviation, despite its value, is an embarrassment to his own special duties, and he may have no ready means to appraise the value if it lies in a sphere outside the functions of his office and outside the sphere of knowledge of his expert advisers. Nor is the advancement of public knowledge at present the care of any single organisation by which such issues could be envisaged as a whole.9. It may be convenient to refer at this point to a particular step towards co-ordination and collaboration which has recently been taken in the realm of pure statistics. The Watson Committee (see paragraph 4 above) thought that a higher level of efficiency in the collection and presentation of official statistics would be achieved by a system of regular consultation between the statistical officers of the different Departments in a committee enjoying an official status, with power to make recommendations to the Departments through their representatives and so to secure that purely statistical considerations will be given due weight by the administrative heads of Departments in deciding on the form and nature of the statistics they publish.10. This committee is now in being. It is, however, purely professional. It exists in order that the statistical officers of the principal Departments may avail themselves of common deliberation on subjects of common interest, but no - executive functions or duties are assigned to it. The existence of the committee serves an admirable object, for it keeps all the statistical officers in touch with one another, and encourages consultation between them in connection with new projects or the curtailment of existing returns. In addition, it has prepared and issued an admirable guide to official statistics, which has met with a wide welcome from the public. But, in the nature of things, it does not go to the root of the matter discussed in this memorandum, for it was not designed for thinking ahead as to the future requirements of Government or the nation for new economic enquiry or new developments of statistical knowledge, and has neither the necessary constitution nor the necessary powers to that end.11. It is suggested, therefore, that there is room for an organisation under the ultimate direction of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet charged with the duty of giving connected forethought from a central standpoint to the development of economic and statistical research in relation, more especially, to problems of an interdepartmental character, or in pursuit of knowledge in spheres not within the orbit of any single Minister. It would delimit new areas in which enquiry would be valuable, and explore the limits of its feasibility, and at the same time (as a -subsidiary function.) delimit areas in which the production of statistics has ceased
to be of use. It would be vital for the success of such an organisation that it, should have among its primary counsellors the Ministers of those Departments, in which economic problems arise and statistical material exists Ministers who, on the active side, can alone compile statistics and authoritatively interpret the material from which they emerge, and who, on the passive side, can alone properly voice from interior knowledge any reasons of public policy or conflict with general administrative polity to which, in particular cases, even interesting or important statistical demands ought to be subordinated.12. Such a suggestion is in no way new. In a report on the machinery of Government issued in 1918 by a Committee over which Lord Haldane presided  (1918. Cd. 9230) the case is set out for making further provision for the organised acquisition of facts and information and for the systematic application of thought as preliminary to the settlement of policy. The report, in allusion to. the Committee of Imperial Defence, recognises that &quot; the exact objectives of civil administration are less obvious and less easily defined than those with which the navy and the army are confronted; and the elaboration of policy cannot be so readily distinguished from the business of administration.&quot; But, subject to these limitations, the case is argued for some general form of organisation to order in various spheres the lines of enquiry and research.13. The analogy for the body suggested in the present note an analogy which has been tested by experience may be found in the Committee of Imperial Defence. The ultimate sanction of the body whose sittings would be occasional as the business before it might dictate would be the Cabinet. The President would be the Prime Minister and the regular Chairman, in the absence of the Prime Minister, would be a Minister nominated by him for the purpose. As in the case of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the membership of this Committee would be fluid in the sense that only those persons would be summoned on particular occasions whom the President (or Chairman) might invite on account of their interest in or their knowledge of the business on hand.14. The President (or Chairman) would also summon for consideration of particular business such outside economic and statistical experts as he mightt think fit.15. Such a Committee on the analogy of the Committee of Imperial Defence  would as a normal part of its working approve the reference of particular enquiries to special sub-committees, which might include outside specialists as well as expert officers of the Department or Departments mainly concerned. Provision would also be made. for using the services of suitable Departmental Officers in the capacity of Secretary to such sub-committees as occasion required.16. Such an organisation a Committee of Economic Enquiry would seem to contain the necessary elements for the purpose in view, and to achieve a three-fold object (a.) To ensure that national problems were actually being faced and thoughtout in advance on a basis of fact; (b.) To assist the Government of the day with an organisation stable but notrigid for exploring the problems in which it is interested, without theneed of improvising co-ordination; and (c.) To utilise to the greatest advantage the existing facilities of the Govern-ment Departments under conditions most likely to command the readyco-operation of their officials.Treasury Chambers, June 1924.
