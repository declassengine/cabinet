imm poouMEflg as 8?hb tM*mix op his britannic majesty:&apos;.s oovgRSMgwra.  1SE0Rgg* Copy No. ^o.P. 157 (25). GAB TOT.&apos;   PROPOSED PUT? ON IMPORTED HOPS. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I desire to submit to the consideration of the Cabinet a proposal for the imposition of a duty of  5 per cwt. on imported hops with a preference of X/3vd in favour of hops of Dominion origin.In order that the industry may not be encouraged to over production, I would only ask that this duty be continued for a period of five years.The proposal follows the disoussion whioh took place at the Imperial Economic conference, 1922.     The following references may be cited;-(a) Extract from Cabinet PaperZ.B.G.    (B. Series) XXIV.3 (vii)   Hogs.   His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared To entertain a proposal to Impose a duty not exceeding  5 per owt. on all foreign hops after the expiry of the period of control, a preference of 50 per cent, or 23 per cent, being accorded to Empire grown hops.(b) Extract from the proceedings at the fifth Meeting of the Conference held on the 9th October, 1923:-p. S06   Cmd. 2009.Sir Philip Lloyd Greame:-. . - . . . * V,Barley and Hops.VrTiien &apos;l Ehink I ought perhaps to mention two matters which are contingent upon decisions of polioy in this country, barley and hops, but I would like to say at once that in the event of a duty being imposed upon malting barley we should give a preference of one-third to the Dominions, and similarly if at the end of the period of the hop control it was decided to safeguard the hop producers hers by means of a duty rather than by means of a continuation of control, we would also give a preference of one-third upon imported hops, which ought to give a considerable benefit.Those are the further items which, as the result of these discussions, we are prepared definitely to table and ask the Parliament of this country to sanction,     I think with that I&apos;would leave the further discussion on Preference open for the conference.&quot;
The need for1 this measure arises from the fcot that the Hop Control which Was renewed for a period cf 5 years by tho Ministry of Pood (Continuance) Act of 1920, terminates on August 25th, 1925.The renewal of the Hop Control has so far fulfilled its purpose of enabling the hop grower to recover from the effects of the Order imposed in 1917, by which he was compelled to grub one half of his acreage under hops without compensation, that the hop acreage, which from 36,600 in 1914 has been reduced to 15,600 In 1918, has been restored to about 27,000. One factor, however, had not been foreseen, that the great increase in the beer duty would so substantially reduce the consumption of beer (37,600,000 barrels In 1914, * 25,400,000 in 1924) that the present acreage of hops Is somewhat in excess of that required to meet the bre?/ers normal consumption of English hops.   Owing further to an abnormally large yield In 1924 at the time the control ends, there will exist a large surplus of English hops, estimated at about a year&apos;3 consumption. I am advised that the imposition of the proposed duty may be expected to reduce the use of foreign hops to about the level that the Hop Controller has been of late enforcing upon the breviers.   At this rate it may be expected that the surplus will be gradually absorbed and the hop acreage stabilised at not much less than its present area, depending on the extant to which the brewing trade revives,I am very conscious that the imposition of the duty alone will till leave the hop growers faced with the danger of a ruinous break of prices for two or three years.   Thoy are very insistent in demanding a continuance of the control in some form or other but the Brewars are equally Insistent that the Control has become unworkable and constitutes a serious inconvenience to the proper conduct of their business.In
6 0 1In the face of the opposition of the brewers I cannot propose the further continuance of Control, which had been agreed between the two parties in 1920. I am however hoping to secure some joint action between brewers and growers that will relieve the present situation and obviate too sericms a break In prices and consequent reduction in the hop acreage within the next year or two.     Failing this,  I may be oompailed to lay further proposals before the cabinet;    the duty however I consider necessary in any case.I am advised that the importation of foreign hops may be expected to settle down to about 50-60,000 owt. per year, on which basis the proposed duty will yield from  250,000 to  200,000 per year.I am informed that the duty will be welcomed by the great body of hop growers as satisfying the needs of the situation, though some of them are aware that it will do little to solve the problem of temporary over production and depression of prices.     I have also reason to suppose that it will not be strongly opposed by the brewing trade.Sl*F*L.i/I.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 17th March, 1925*
