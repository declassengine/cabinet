THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.SECRET..,Memorandum by the Minister of Labour. ) ;\CP.--------------------------------------176(85) .BASIS OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,Prom what I have heard in the House of Commons from some of the Labour Members I think it is likely that they may make a push onoe again to suggest that Unemployment Insurance should be made a non-contributory scheme.     There is always somewhat of a danger lest, if this be done,  the employers also should be attracted by the    idea, heavily burdened as production is by charges for looal rates and social servioes,     I take it that I may assume that the epinion of the Cabinet is that I should stand firm and should *obstare prinoipiisf as the idea may be sprung on any suitable occasion.(intld,) A. S-M.Ministry-of Labour, 24th Maroh,  1935.
