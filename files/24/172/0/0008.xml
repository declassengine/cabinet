[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.&quot; &quot;Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.SECRET.CP. 108 (25).CABINET.IRAQ:   TURKISH PETROLEUM COMPANY.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for the Colonies.THE latest telegrams from Sir Henry Dobbs indicate that the negotiations for the grant of an oil concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company have reached a. crisis. It is impossible to give within reasonable compass a statement of all the questions involved in the controversy, and this memorandum is merely an attempt, to summarise the points of first-rate importance.His Majesty&apos;s Government have always held that the Ottoman Government, on the 28th June, 1914, promised the grant of a concession for all oil-springs in the^ Vilayets of Mosul and Baghdad to the Turkish Petroleum Company. This view was very strongly expressed in Lord Curzon&apos;s correspondence with Mr. Davis, which was presented to Parliament in 1921 (Cmd 1226). The British view on this subject was repeated several times during the course of the peace treaty, negotiations at. Lausanne, and the Foreign Office memorandum gives expression to the official Foreign Office view as follows: &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have consistently claimed that the note addressed by the Turkish Grand Vizier to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Constantinople on the 28th June, 1914, secured for the Turkish Petroleum Company a definite right to the concession of all petroleum springs in the Vilayets of Mosul and Baghdad, and that it binds alike the Turkish Govern-ment, in so far as that Government is or may be still concerned, and any-Government substituted for the Turkish Government in Iraq.&quot;This is the first factor in the problem which has to be solved. Other complicating factors were introduced by the San Remo Oil Agreement of the 24th April, 1920 (Cmd. 675). By that Agreement between England and France it. was provided that, &quot; in the event of a private petroleum company being arranged to develop the Mesopotamian oil-fields, the British Government will place at the disposal of the French Government a share of 25 per cent, in such Company.&quot; It was further agreed &quot; that, should the private petroleum company be constituted as aforesaid, the native Government or other native interests shall be allowed, if they so desire, to participate up to a maximum of 20 per cent, of the share capital of the said company.&quot;It should be explained that the Turkish Petroleum Company, to which a promise was made by the Grand Vizier in June 1914, was an amalgamation of interests in the following proportions : During the war the German shares were sequestrated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the promise made to France at San Remo was carried into effect by handing over the German shares to the French Government. At a later stage it was decided that the best way of meeting the difficult attitude of the American Government on the subject of the Turkish petroleum concession, and also on the general question ofPer cent.Anglo-Persian Royal Dutch Shell German ......W50 25 25[12737]b
our claim to be the Mandatory for Iraq, would be to concede a share in the Turkish Petroleum Company to substantial American interests. This involved a great battle with the different Groups, but it was finally settled comparatively amicably, and the present constitution of the Turkish Petroleum Company is as followsPer cent.Anglo-Persian     ... ... ... ... ... 25Royal Dutch Shell ... ... ... ... 25French Companies to which the French Governmentsinterest has been transferred    ... ... ... 25An American group comprising the Standard Oil and sixother large American Corporations        ... ... 25The other provision in the San Remo Agreement quoted above for a 20 per cent, local Iraq interest in the Company is the main source of the present trouble.Negotiations jfor the determination of the terms of the concession to be granted to the Turkish Petroleum Company began in London in the autumn of 1922. They were conducted at the Colonial Office, and Sassoon Effendi, who was then, and is again now, Minister of Finance in Iraq, was present at the most important stages. The Colonial Office and the Petroleum Department of the Board of Trade both took part in the negotiations with a view to endeavouring to secure that the best interests of Iraq were served by the arrangement made, and that it was an arrangement not open to serious objection on technical grounds. These negotiations have been continuing ever since, mainly in Baghdad, where Mr. Keeling has been the repre-sentative of the Turkish Petroleum Company. The question of the possibility of allowing a share participation up to 20 per cent, to the Iraq Government or Iraq nationals was raised at the very first, but, unfortunately, was left by the negotia-tions of 1922 in a somewhat ambiguous position. Sassoon pressed the claim and the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s representatives emphasised the close connection which any such claim must have with the rate of royalty to be fixed and pointed out that they had already provisionally.agreed to a rate of royalty, and that their agreement had been based on the assumption that no claim to share participation wculd be preferred. The negotiations at Baghdad have been extremely long drawn out. They were interrupted by the political crisis of last year connected with the ratification of the Treaty, and Mr. Keeling came home again. When it seemed possible to induce Iraq to attend to something else besides the political crisis, he went back again, and &quot;we have had fairly full accounts of the progress of negotiations, both from the High Commissioner and also from the Turkish Petroleum Company. The Turkish Petroleum Company have given way on a very large number of j)points. They have conceded what must be regarded as a high rate of royalty, namely, 4s. per ton. They have agreed to put this on a gold basis, so that Iraq will be protected against any possible future depreciation of the pound sterling, or even the dollar (the period for the concession is 75 years). They have promised Iraq a local price; which shall be 30 per cent, below the Swansea price of the day (the Anglo-Persian refinery plant is at Swansea). They have, in fact, made every concession which we considered they could reasonably be asked to make, and a good many concessions which we could only regard as unreasonable. Iraq has pressed a number of absurd claims. She has asked, for instance, that the whole of the pipe line to be constructed, hundreds of miles of which will be in Syrian and Palestine territory, shall revert with the land on which it lies to the Iraq Government on the termination of the concession. We are justified in saying that the latest draft of the &quot; Convention,&quot; which embodies the concessions, contains terms more favourable to the Iraq Government than the terms obtained by any Government anywhere in any concession relating to oil.Iraq pressed the claim to a 20 per cent, share participation in the Company some time ago, and we then took the matter up with the Turkish Petroleum Company and were rather inclined to support the claim of the Iraq Government under the terms of the San Remo Agreement. At the same time we did not think that it was of any real advantage for Iraq to have such a share. The grant of shares in the Company would undoubtedly have to be attended by a substantial reduction in the rate of royalty proposed. The Iraq Government would therefore suffer a reduction in an item of revenue which would be a first charge on the Company before the calculation of any profits. They might appear to have a certain prospect of very high profits should, the Turkish Petroleum Company prove an enormously profitable undertaking; but this appearance was really deceptive. The whole of the ordinary share capital in the Turkish Petroleum Company was to be held by big oil
corporations, and they had absolutely no interest in securing a particularly high rate of profit from their investment in&apos; the Turkish Petroleum Company. In fact, it would pay them perfectly well to earn no profit at all on such investment, if they obtain the oil from the Company at a cheap rate. The French, the Americans and. the Dutch, representing between them 65 per cent, of the share capital, would prefer that the profits of the Company should be small, because those profits are subject to British income tax. Consequently, the Iraq Government would be the only share-holder in the Company which would have any interest in high profits being earned. Apart from this, the provision of a 20 per cent, share interest to Iraq would present probably insuperable difficulties in arriving at an agreement between the various National interests participating in the Turkish Petroleum Company. The French Group are already extremely dissatisfied in fact they were recently believed to be no longer on speaking terms with their British and American partners because they are being required to contribute towards the claim of Mr. Gulbenkian, who has a 5 per cent, interest in the whole affair, dating back to the very earliest days. It seems quite certain that it would be impossible to induce the French and Americans to consent to a reduction of their 25 per cent, interest to a 20 per cent, (or, allowing for Mr. Gulbenkian, 18f per cent.) interest; apart from the difficulty of getting the Anglo-Persian (who started in 1914 with a 50 per cent, interest) and the Royal Dutch-Shell to accept such an arrangement. We have put all the considerations very clearly before the Iraq Government, and pointed out to them that there was no certain prospect of a high rate of profit, and that subscription by Iraq of  2,000,000 towards the capital expenditure required was impracticable. Until recently, we supposed that the claim to direct share participation had been abandoned by the Iraq Ministers. This appeared to be indicated by the minutes of the Conferences about the drafting of the &quot; Convention,&quot; which we received from Sir Henry Dobbs. It appeared to be a reasonable attitude in view of the very big surrenders made by the promoters of the Turkish Petroleum Company on a variety of points, surrenders which were made under the distinct impression that the share participation claim was dead. It now appears that three Ministers out of seven have refused to vote for the signature of the &quot; Convention.&quot; The Prime Minister suggests that they would sign it if we accepted a new clause providing that the Iraq Parliament may desire the Government to apply to the Company for an allotment of shares up to 20 per cent., and that such an application shall be followed by negotiations as to the proportion of shares to be allotted and the consequential reduction, if any, in the royalty. Failing agreement between the Government and the Company on these points, the matter shall be referred to arbitration. The High Commissioner has told the Prime Minister that it was useless to submit this suggestion. It has been communicated to the Company, and they have declared that it is quite inadmissible and could not be entertained without a complete rewriting of the whole Convention and the with-dfawal of many of the points which they have already conceded. It involves the submission to arbitration of a point wholly unsuitable for decision in that manner. The promoters of the Turkish Petroleum Company recently indicated to the Secretary of State that their patience was practically exhausted, and that they considered that in agreeing to a royalty on a gold basis and making several other surrenders on minor points they had exhausted their stock of surrenders. The January draft, which the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram No. 9 of the 7th January treated as the last word, has in fact been further amended, and the Company have accepted all the amendments except one dealing with the calculation of &quot; cost price,&quot; which is said to be technically impracticable.It will be seen from the above that the grant of a concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company is regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as a clear inter-national obligation of Iraq. Apart from this, on general grounds, there can be no doubt that it is to the substantial interest of Iraq. The Turkish Petroleum Company as now constituted will be probably the most powerful financial Corporation in the world. It can face with comparative equanimity a probable capital expenditure of from  10,000,000 to  20,000,000. It can ensure every possible effort being made to develop the resources of the Mosul oil-fields. The international position of the Company will result in several countries having a direct interest in the &quot; peace, order and good government &quot; of Iraq. We are likely to hear nothing more about the State departments qualms on the subject of a Mandate if America holds a 25 per cent., interest in the Company, and the sacred principle of the &quot;open door,&quot; to which the American &quot; Observer &quot; bore testimony at Lausanne, is inscribed on its banner. It is, therefore, an international obligation of Iraq to grant a concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company, and it is very much in her interest that such a concession should[12737]      &apos; b 2
be granted. If we are to wait until the; Organic Law comes into operation then the concession can only be granted by the new Legislative Assembly. Our past experience with the Constituent Assembly indicates that this will lead to endless talk and endless agitation and intrigue. There is only too much reason to believe that it will also lead to free-handed bribery on the part of several somewhat shady interests which have been seeking to obtain oil concessions in Iraq. It is also extremely probable that the American Group at present in the Turkish Petroleum Company will break away from it and go concession-hunting on its own, and that this development will be accompanied by a renewal of diplomatic activity on the part of the State Department at Washington.The draft telegram is an attempt to state the substance of these considerations quite clearly in a form which may be suitable for publication, if necessary, hereafter. There can be no doubt that many accusations will be brought of undue regard to monied interests, and that there will be the usual talk about the taint of oil politics. The easiest thing to do would be to disarm these criticisms by allowing the whole matter to go over to the Legislative Assembly. It would be the easiest thing to do at the moment, but would probably lead to indefinite diplomatic and other troubles hereafter. Apart from the question of easiness, or difficulty, it would certainly not be the best thing to do for the future financial interests of Iraq.Copies of the following telegrams, which indicate the most recent developments-of the situation, are appended :-High Commissioner to Secretary of State, No. 6, January 2. Secretary of State to High Commissioner, No. 9, January 7. High Commissioner to Secretary of State, No. 42, January 21. High Commissioner to Secretary of State, No. 66, January 30.

A.Colonial Office, February 23, 1925.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of Statefor the. Colonies, dated January 2.(Received Colonial Office, 5-55 p.m., January 2, 1925.)No. 6.   Priority.Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s Concession. Please refer to my telegram No. 686 of 23rd December and your telegram No. 537 of 18th December (last part).1. Substitution of Iraq Government for Company in whole area outside twenty-four selected plots. Telegram refusing to entertain proposal has been received by Keeling. Iraq Government is actuated partly by amour-propre, partly by suspicion that if prospecting and development of the whole area is left in hands of Company and its sub-lessees they may fail to develop with utmost vigour if market conditions are unfavourable. However unreasonable this attitude may be, I feel confident that negotia-tions will break down if Company does not give way on this point.2. Gold basis for royalty. Recent appreciation in sterling and improbability of serious depreciation while present British financial methods continue is fully recognised by Government of Iraq, but they cannot shut their eyes to possibility of deliberate policy of inflation being adopted by some future Government as remedy for unemployment or on other grounds, in view of persistent advocacy of such.policy by influential school of British Economists. I consider that this apprehension is fully justifiable, and that they are entitled to guard against it. I fear that they are likely to be inflexible on this point also.3. Sliding scale for royalty. Proposal accepted by Company in alternative B Clause I 10 was that royalty should be readjusted after twenty years, according to a sliding scale based on difference between percentage
increase or decrease of price and percentage increase or decrease in cost, Government of Iraq represent that under this scheme Company might be making larger profits per ton without increase in royalty (vide letter from Keeling to Company of 18th December), and that increase or decrease per ton is a fairer basis. Company will not accept, and Iraq Government have refused to yield. Keeling and I consider the arrange-&apos; ment fair.4. Customs on materials for operations. It is pointed out by Iraq Government that if there are large numbers of sub-lessee companies serious abuses may result from unrestricted permission to- import free of duty housing materials for employees, since these materials cannot be identified and may easily be disposed of in the country. After prolonged discussions, compromise, which has Keeling&apos;s support, was reached as follows : that in case of each separate oil-field, all materials required within ten years, after starting of drilling for construction of houses in oil-fields and refineries and along pipe-lines, shall be imported duty free. This prevents material for the construction of offices and houses in populous centres where they could easily be dishonestly disposed of being imported free, but gives all that- is required outside such centres for first ten years after which duty payable on housing material will not be serious burden.. Individual Ministers state that they obliged to insist on this restriction by their experience of methods of Trench-American concessionaires, elsewhere. I consider compromise is reasonable, but Company have telegraphed to Keeling refusing to consider it. Iraq Government will, not give way.I trust you will be able to induce the Company to accept Iraq views on all four-points.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theHigh Commissioner for Iraq.(Sent 5-55 p.m. January 7, 1925.)No. 9.Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s Concession,-reference your telegram No. 6 of the 2nd January. I have communicated with Company and have urged them to go to the utmost possible limit on all four points to meet Government of Iraq. At the same time I think that I ought to tell you that I am not satisfied that Government is taking up a reasonable attitude in these matters. Their practice of constantly raising entirely new points has led me to doubt both bona fides and business capacity of Government and has produced bad impression here. Turkish Petroleum Company have shewn me their telegrams Nos. 65 and 66 which they have sent to Keeling. You will realise that point raised in 66 is of vital importance and that area of concession must remain as in previous drafts, Company retaining rights and obligations over whole original area, though administration of &quot;open door&quot; formula by Iraq is-admitted in principle. I am of the opinion that telegram No. 65 gives Iraq all that she can reasonably ask on all four points; it is more than I anticipated Company would - concede. Now that settlement appears to be in sight on all matters of importance I sincerely hope that Company will not be faced with fresh proposals for amendment, and that, final conclusion of Convention will be arranged. Unless foreign capital is introduced to develop Iraq&apos;s resources I cannot see that she has any hope of meeting her expenses. Capital represented by Turkish Petroleum Company is so great that similar favourable opportunity is unlikely to recur, and best testimony to her financial capacity that Iraq could produce at present moment would be conclusion of Agreement with such powerful interests offering good prospect of real development of Iraq resources and consequent substantial improvement of financial position. You must realise that it has been very difficult for Turkish Petroleum Company to carry on negotiations owing to variety of International interests involved, and I consider that Company deserve credit for repeated readiness to meet Iraq in spite of serious difficulties thereby caused with their own associates.

Paraphrase Telegram from the. High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated January 21.(Received Colonial Office 4&apos;50 p.m. January 21, 1925.)No. 42. :Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s Concession : Reference to your telegram No. 22 of the 20th January. Ministerial Committee has been reviewing whole draft convention with Keeling in the light qf discussions over which I presided before Christmas. Keeling seems fairly optimistic. During the past few days whole business of Iraq Government has been suspended owing to visit of Frontier Commission, but I intend to resume discussions when Commission leaves for Mosul in a few days&apos; time. There is, I think, a fair chance of settlement before Organic Law is promulgated.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated January 30, 1925.(Received Colonial Office 9-35 p.m. January 30, 1925.)No. 66.Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s Concession : Gold basis for royalty. Reference paragraph (2) of my telegram No. 6 of the 2nd January. As you are aware, Turkish Petroleum Company have agreed that royalty must be expressed as the equivalent of 4 shillings in the United States currency at par. It is pointed out by Iraq Government that concession is to be for seventy-five years, and that policy of inflation may at some time during such prolonged period, be adopted by the United States quite as probably as Great Britain. They are unable to understand why similar expression to &apos; francs d&apos;or &quot; or gold francs which is used to safeguard against depreciation of the franc in all Ottoman debt bonds which they have examined should not be used without offence or objection in order to guard against depreciation of the shilling. This obvious argument has already been anticipated by Keeling, who referred it to his company. Company have telegraphed flatly refusing to entertain the suggestion without giving any reason. This bullying attitude over perfectly reasonable copten-tion of Iraq Government merely arouses intense resentment here and defeats all chance of securing grant of concession which otherwise is good. Iraq Government now propose formula on the following lines, which I trust you will be able to induce the Company to accept, if you consider the formula effective, &quot;Royalty shall be one-fifth of sovereign of present weight and fineness. The two contracting parties shall, failing agreement, resort to arbitration as to the amount of royalty to be paid.&quot;If this is not acceptable I should be grateful for suggestion of better formula to provide payment in gold shillings. Although Ministers are showing themselves much .more accommodating they refuse to yield over this point.   I concur in their views.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theHigh Commissioner for Iraq,(Sent 11-20 a.m. February 7, 1925.)No. 52.Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s Concession : Reference to your telegram No. 66 of the 30th January. I have had an interview with Turkish Petroleum Company and have persuaded them to accept payment of royalty on gold basis, but only on express condition of prompt signature by Iraq Government of the draft Convention of January, copy of which Keeling will give you. Company have stipulated that there shall be no further amendments of that draft, and after perusing it I concur in their&apos; view that they have met Iraq handsomely on all counts and that any further modification would be serious handicap and might render Concession unworkable. All amendments to draft of July have, I am advised, been to Iraq&apos;s advantage and their cumulative effect has been to render terms of Concession exceptionally, favourable to Government. You should impress this upon the Government of Iraq and make every endeavour to obtain signature at a very early date. You should emphasise advantages of this course as (1) securing assistance of a corporation of
-almost unlimited financial resources in development of Iraq oil; (2) offering prospect of revenue which Iraq so badly needs; and (3) tending to remove whole question from political arena. As regards point (3) there are indications that there will be revival of international complications (which I am most anxious to avoid) if matter is not disposed of very shortly. Groups constituting Turkish Petroleum Company have plainly indicated impatience over tediousness of negotiations and the constant raising of fresh issues by the Iraq Government. After careful consideration of the case with every desire to protect Iraq interests, I feel that this impatience is not unwarranted. I trust; therefore, that you will be able to find means to avert undesirable developments by prevailing on Iraq Government to accept and sign January draft,I am advised that it is not necessary to introduce ratio of weight and fineness of gold sovereign into formula, and that royalty payable in shillings (gold) will provide adequate safeguard against any currency depreciation. In view of comprehensive terms of Article 37, reference to special arbitration also appears unnecessary. I am informed by the Turkish Petroleum Company that of the four alternatives submitted under Article 15 Iraq Government incline towards alternative (D). The Company propose this alternative should be redrafted as follows : &quot;The price at which requirements of any refined product under sub-section (c) hereof, shall be supplied at any Iraq Refinery in any calendar month shall be at least 30 per cent, less than the market price of the nearest similar product, sold in similar quantities, at Swansea, during the last calendar month but one.&quot;I am advised that this arrangement will be in favour of Iraq and should be accepted.As, in view of Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s attitude, which has my support, it would be useless to submit further&apos; amendments favourable to Iraq, I trust that negotiations can be so steered as to bringxabout immediate signature. Amery.Paraphrase Telegram from, the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated February 17.(Received Colonial Office, 5-30 a.m., February 18, 1925.)No. 94.Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s Concession, see your telegram No. 52 of the 7th February. During the past week newspaper attacks on Turkish Petroleum have greatly increased, and the two principal parties, the People&apos;s party and Nahdha, have combined to make protests and demonstrations against the grant of the concession before Parliament meets. Moreover, the three Ministers of Justice, Works and Education are absolutely impervious to argument, and have declared their intention of resigning should the Prime Minister, using the bare majority in the Cabinet of himself and Ministers of Auqaf, Finance and Interior, force the concession through. With the probability of his political opponents sweeping the country in the coming elections on the plank of the condemnation of the grant of the concession, it is almost certain that the Prime Minister cannot face this immediate opposition, and that the concession cannot go through unless His Majesty&apos;s Government takes immediate and drastic action. Right of the Iraq Government to share under the San Remo Agreement is the point on which criticism centres. Some days ago Prime Minister told me that if the clause permitting arbitration on question of shares (which is set forth in my immediately following telegram) could be added, he could secure the immediate signature of the concession. I replied that it was useless to submit the suggestion to you. I have used every conceivable argument, taking full advantage of the Frontier Commission^ attitude already reported, and of fact which now appears, that Paulis, before taking his departure from Baghdad, declared to Minister of Finance that the first of the two parties to the frontier dispute to grant oil concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company would get Mosul Vilayet. I have also stated plainly that I anticipate that if the Iraq Government gives proof of its complete business incapacity and ignorant obstinacy by refusing to grant concession in the circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government will lose interest in the future of Iraq and will confine themselves to meeting their barest obligations under the Anglo-Iraq Treaty, and will certainly- not be prepared to give Iraq any generous assistance. I have prophesied that the United States will refuse to agree to His Majesty&apos;s
Government&apos;s treaty arrangements with Iraq which the League of Nations has-accepted, and may try to insist on the immediate re-establishment of the Capitulations for herself. . Recalcitrant Ministers merely reply that they, are perfectly well aware of the difficulties and dangers which &apos; will be caused by the refusal of the concession, but that they are confident that Great Britain will pull them out of the hole. Under the San Remo Agreement they have a right to shares which they cannot abandon without . the sanction of the Mesopotamia Parliament; although they admit that they would be unable to find the capital required, such right must, they argue, be recognised in the concession. Meanwhile, the council has formally indicated its refusal to pay the 30 lacs instalment of Ottoman Debt which is due this year on the grounds that payment would entail the suspension of the payment of salaries and bring the machinery of the administration to a standstill. I am replying that I have satisfied myself that they possess sufficient cash for payment if they exert themselves, and that refusal constitutes a grave breach of the treaty, which I am reporting to His Majesty&apos;s Government. I consider that this presents an opportunity for immediate [ ?forcible] action, and [ ? accordingly] recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government send message on the following lines if I report within the next few days that Cabinet refuse to pass the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s concession : 1. His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that the grant of the concession on the terms proposed is in the best interests of Iraq and is the sole means of preventing financial collapse, interesting foreign capital and influence, and securing Iraq from many pressing diplomatic difficulties.2. Refusal of the Government to pass the convention prior to the meeting of Parliament practically constitutes indefinite postponement of concession, as all are agreed that inexperienced assembly will be incapable of dealing with it.3. Simultaneous refusal of Iraq Government to meet Ottoman Debt obligations constitutes breach of the treaty.4. In the circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government must immediately and fundamentally reconsider their relations towards Iraq, and must hold themselves free again to consult the League of Nations in the matter.5. Visit which is contemplated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for Air (of which I have been informed by side-wind from Air Headquarters) will not take place, as no purpose wculd be served, in changed circumstances, in their discussing financial and defence problems.6. Nor will proposal to despatch financial commission to Iraq be proceeded with.Unless His Majesty&apos;s Government are either prepared to send some such message or [ ? to propound], it should be understood [group corrupt : 1 that without] proviso regarding shares advanced by Prime Minister I see no. chance of getting convention through.Postscript. Since drafting the above I have seen King Feisal. He informs me he has talked with the recalcitrant Ministers for hours, but has been unable to make them see reason. He is prepared to dismiss the Cabinet and to appoint one which would be ready to grant the concession; such action would, I am afraid, place him in an impossible position. He begs me as last resource to induce His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to despatch strong message immediately on lines indicated above, without waiting for definite refusal of Cabinet, as he is of the opinion that this might make the recalcitrant Ministers see reason and force them to give up the delusion that they will get Great Britain&apos;s help whatever they do.Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for theColonies, dated February 17.(Received Colonial Office, 11-40 a.m., February 18, 1925.)No. 95.   February 17.Priority.   My immediately pieceding telegram.Following is the suggested additional clause to the Petroleum Convention :-Begins: &quot; Provided that Iraq Government shall submit to next Parliament of Iraq at the earliest possible moment after its first meeting question as to
whether the said Parliament desires that Iraq Government shall apply to the company for an allotment to the Government of shares in the company on behalf of its subjects up to 20 per cent, of the shares of the capital at par. If the said Parliament shall request the Government to make such application to the company, the Government and company shall forthwith, and in any case no later than three months after signature of this convention, enter into negotiations as to what proportion of shares of the capital shall be allotted to the Government not exceeding 20 per cent, of such shares of the capital, and what, if any, con-sequential reduction shall be made in royalty fixed ,under article 10 of this convention, and, if they cannot come to an agreement, they shall refer the afore-said questions to arbitration under article 37 of this convention, and the terms of this convention shall, if necessary, be amended according to the agreement between the Government and the company, or according to the decision of arbitrators failing such agreement.&quot;   Ends.-Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated February 18.-(Received Colonial Office 10-29 a.m. February 18, 1925.)No. 96.Please refer to my telegram No. 94 of the 17th February. Prime Minister under pressure from political parties has made public announcement to the effect that the promulgation of the Organic Law will take place in two weeks and that the elections will be rapidly completed. Decision regarding His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government^ action as to Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s concession must therefore be taken urgently.Draft of Proposed Telegram to High Commissioner for Iraq.Financial position and prospects of Iraq have been made subject of most anxious /consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The whole object&apos;of their policy has been to hand over country to its new legislature with its financial independence, which is the necessary condition of political independence, reasonably established. H.M.G. are convinced that Iraq cannot hope for financial stability, except through development of its resources through introduction of foreign capital. Of their resources by far the most promising is oil development. HM.G. have publicly committed themselves again and again to view that Turkish Government definitely promised in 1914 to grant oil concession to Turkish Petroleum Company, and that Iraq inherited the obligation of the Turkish Government, and Concessions Protocol attached to Treaty of Lausanne makes this perfectly clear. H.M.G. have viewed with favour and done their best to promote reconstruction of T.P.Co., under which it has become representative of principal oil interests of England, France, Holland and United States. Risk of international rivalry and diplomatic complications over Iraq oil-fields has thereby been reduced to a minimum, and fullest possible develop-ment has been assured by creation of an enterprise of unrivalled financial resources, technical experience and skill. H.M.G. have watched negotiation of convention and have repeatedly used their influence with success to induce promoters to make concessions to Iraq. They believe latest draft of convention to embody terms more favourable to Government of Iraq than terms secured by any Government elsewhere in any oil concession. To postpone signature of convention at this juncture and throw responsibility on shoulders of legislative assembly may look like a tribute to democracy, but is in fact an act which deprives new legislature of economic security which it has a right to expect, and imposes on it impossible task which will cripple its usefulness in performing its other functions. H.M.G. had hoped that present Iraq Ministers would not shirk responsibility in the manner described in your telegram, but if they continue to do so H.M.G. are clearly of opinion that you should advise Feisal to dismiss them and substitute Ministers prepared to sign T.P.Co. Concession. They fully realise that both Iraq Government and they themselves will he subject to attacks based on plausible misrepresentation of action taken solely on considered grounds of public policy, but they do not think that consciousness of this should deter either Government from course of action which they believe to .be :right.o
