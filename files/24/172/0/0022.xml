[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] -Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of State.CONFIDENTIAL,C.P.122(25)CABINET.BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY AND THE PROBLEM OF SECURITY.SO completely does the question of Security dominate the Europe of to-day that in the discharge of my duties as Foreign Secretary my thoughts are hardly ever allowed to leave it. No Ambassador or Minister ever calls upon me without raising it directly or indirectly. Despatches from abroad are full of it. All negotiations depend upon it, and without a decision in regard to it this Country can have no foreign policy; our relations with our neighbours remain Unsettled and at the hazard of their uneasiness; our relations with Germany make no progress, and our influence in Europe is diminished by the knowledge that we do not know our own mind and cannot decide what role to play in the society of nations.2. I have used the common phrase &quot; Security.&quot; But in truth it is not so much the negative absence of security as the positive sense of insecurity which poisons international relations at the present time. The pre-war European system has been consumed in the fires of that great struggle and buried under the ruins that it created. No effective substitute has been found. After the Napoleonic wars the first task of British statesmanship was to reconstitute Europe through the concert of the great Powers and to make a place in that system for the France of the restoration. The; statesmen assembled at Versailles undertook a more ambitious task. They attempted to substitute a world-alliance for the concert of the great Powers. Unhappily their scheme was from the first vitiated by the Iwithdrawal of the United States&apos; and the absence of Russia. But  here is another reason why the guarantees for peace provided by the covenant were thought insufficient at Versailles and are proved insufficient to-day. Guarantees of such extensive scope, embracing every cause of quarrel in every part of the world, must always or, at any rate, till the world has greatly changed leave a doubt in the minds of men as to whether, if a crisis arises in which some of the Powers have little interest and others none at all, these guarantees will be effective; whether, in fact, nations unaffected by the cause of the quarrel and the fate of the disputants will expose themselves to all the inconveniences, burdens and damages of the action expected from them; and whether, if they did indeed act, their assistance could arrive in time to protect the injured or to secure redress. In other words, the more universal the guarantee, the greater the doubt as to its efficacy in any particular case. Is it conceivable, for example, that a generation hence any British Government will risk a clash with America in defence of the Polish: corridor ? Is it likely that the British Government will at any time be prepared to spend British lives and treasure in defence of the independence of the Baltic States ? And if we have in our own minds reservations in regard to British action in such matters, must we not suppose that other Powers make similar mental reserves, and what is left, secure and definite, in this ambitious world-wide pact ?3. These considerations influenced the Allied and Associated statesmen when they were considering the terms of the Peace Treaty and framing the Covenant. M. Clemenceau claimed on behalf of France as her only effective protection against a new violation of her soil, the separation of the left bank of the Rhine from Germany. The Allies successfully resisted this effort to break up the German Reich, but only by pledging to France the support of the whole strength of the United States and Great Britain in case of fresh unprovoked aggression by Germany. Thus France abandoned her claim, as she conceived, for value received. But owing to the action of the American Senate the consideration has never been paid. France, therefore, not only feels herself insecure, but insecure by reason, first, of the action and then the default of her friends. I do not think that anyone can properly appreciate1 the French point of view who does not take as his starting-point this fact : that President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George, the representatives of their respective2710   [12759]
States, recognised France&apos;s need for a special security which, in fact, she has never received. It was, I think, largely the sense that we had an unpaid debt to France which caused the British Government again to offer a pact of security at Cannes. This time the offer was rendered of no avail by the folly of M-.- Poincare. Few Frenchmen to-day would justify his attitude either then or at the time of the Paris Conference with Mr. Bonar Law. But can we fairly argue that his impolitic and uncompromising attitude discharges us from our obligations?4. So far I have spoken of the uneasiness of Europe and of the feelings of Frenchmen. But the case for an agreement with France does not rest only or mainly&apos;upon these considerations. British interests are affected at every turn by the insecurity of the European situation. We live too close to its shores to escape being affected by the unrest of the Continent. We have never at any time in our history succeeded in separating our interests from events across the Channel. When we have attempted a policy of isolation we have indeed forfeited much of our influence in world affairs, but we have never been able for long to remain disinterested spectators of the troubles of the Continent.5. But our interest is even more direct and absolute than this. British foreign policy has been permanently governed by the determination not to allow a single Power to dominate Europe. This is the true meaning of the doctrine of the Balance of Power; but it has had a special purpose in British eyes and has met a special need in British policy. Our interest in the ports of the Channel and North Sea is vital. We have been ready at all times in our history to defend that interest and to fight to the bitter end to prevent the coasts opposite our shores from being dominated by a single great military Power. This necessity has given to the foreign policy of this country in European affairs whatever consistency it has possessed. The creation of the British Empire may almost be said to be a by-product of its execution. Its maintenance must always be of vital concern to our own safety. But we can no longer regard the freedom of the Channel and our predominance at sea as giving us this security. The development of air warfare and of artillery expose us to the possibility of destruction even if our fleets continue to dominate the narrow seas. The frontiers of France and the Low Countries now bear the same relation to the heart of the Empire as the Channel ports did 100 or 200 years ago. Whether, there-fore, we have a pact with France or not, we can never allow a restored Germany to break down those frontiers. If ever Germany makes the attempt, pact or no pact, we must fight for our own existence, for a Germany established in the Low Countries a,nd dominating France would hold the heart of the British Empire at its mercy.6. What then do we gain, and what do we lose, by recognising this fact and proclaiming it to our own people and to the world ? I submit that we lose nothing and may gain much. As an Ally we have a right to speak with an authority and to expect to exert an influence with France that we can neither claim nor expect whilst we hold ourselves coldly detached. In the second place, it is far less likely that we shall ever be called upon to act, if it is clearly known that upon such a challenge we should again exert all our force and never cease until our end was accomplished just as our forefathers did in the great war against Napoleonic France and we ourselves in the greater war of yesterday. Lastly, our own people would understand upon what their safety depended, and the democracy, upon whom the future of the British Empire depends, would have the basis for a foreign policy drawn directly from the necessities of our own security, directed only to defence and not to aggression, and giving scope to the British Empire for the full exercise of its authority and influence in promoting the peace of the world.7. If this policv be rejected, I know not what other can be substituted for it. The provisions of the Treaty in relation to disarmament will never be completely fulfilled. France can always find Treaty reasons good or bad for continuing the occupation of German soil. Her policy towards Germany will not merely continue to be one of constant irritation and offence, but will be exacerbated by the increase of her fears. Feeling herself deserted alike by the British Empire and the United States, she will pursue her own way, dragging us impotent and reluctant in her wake; and when the inevitable crisis follows, we shall either be forced to take part in a fight which we might have prevented, and perhaps on an issue which we disapprove, or we shall see the whole European situation vitally altered to our disadvantage and be left to face the consequent dangers to ourselves without a friend in Europe upon whose assistance or even goodwill we can count.AC&apos;February 26, 1925,
