THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. CABINET. J*  CP.173(25). COAL.Note by the President of the Board of Trade. I oiroulate herewith (a) a statement of the lino which the Secretary for Mines proposes to follow In the debate on retail coal prices,  (b) a note on the Coal Mines  (Minimum Wago) Bill, which is first order on Friday, the 27th March.    As regards the latter   I think the argument which the Secretary for Mines proposes to use is the best in the circumstances.Board of Trade.P. C-L. 20. 3. 26.
RETAIL COAL PRICES.In accordance with the recent decision of the Cabinet I propose to deal in debate with the question of Government action in relation to retail coal prices on Wednesday, March 25th, on the following general lines:At present, owing to the circumstances to which I have referred, e.g., the very large sboeks of soal in the coal merchants1 hands, the small demand owing to the mild weather and the steady prices and o.bsenoe of general complaint, the situation doss not sasin to call for immediate action on the part of the Government. But I shall continue to watch it very carefully, and if necessary the Government will ask parliament to enlarge the powers at present entrusted to the Secretary for Mines by the Mining Industry Act so as to enable a compulsory investigation to be made of the accounts of retail coal dealers with a view to publishing the full facts and figures if it is found that the public is being exploited; and if the resulting pressure of public opinion proves insufficient, the Government will be prepared to take further action.G. Lane Fox.
0(0COAL MINES (MINIMUM WAGE) BILL.I should like bo have Cabinet approval of the views whioh I proposo to express on the Second Reading of Mr. Walsh&apos;a Coal Mines  (Minimum Wage) Bill on Friday, March 27th.The Bill is not yet printed but I am informed by those responsible for its drafting that it is to be a short Bill providing that ho adult employed at a colliery shall bo paid at less than the following rates:-I attach a note dealing with the probable effect of the Bill upon wages in the industry.   From this it is sufficiently clear that the proposal in the Bill is an impracticable one in present conditions, but I do not propose to deal with the matter from this point of view. I propose rather to point out that this Bill, whatever its title may be, is not a Miniumm Wage Bill in the sense of the Coal Mines (Minimum Wago) Act, 1912, but is a Bill whioh would have the effect of altering the general level of wages now current in the industry; that it deals therefore with a matter that should be settled between the owners and workmen as in other large industries that not only are wages at present paid under an agreement between masters and men whioh will in the near future be under reconsider a-tion but that friendly negotiations are already on foot between the owners and the workmen&apos;s representatives to examino the general condition of the industry including wages j and that it would be quite improper therefore for parliament to attempt to pronounce upon the matter in the manner proposed by this Bill.Coal GettersOther underground labourSurface Labour12/- per shift. 11/-   &quot;       &quot; 10/-   &quot;       &quot;G.

Mr. Walsh&apos;a Bill.It is understood that in form this will be a Bill to amend the Goal Mines (Minimum Wage) Aot, 1912.     But sufficient is known of its proposals to make it clear that it is in fact something essentially different.     The negotiations which led to the Aot of 1912 were concerned primarily with the underground pieceworker who, owing to unfavourable conditions, might have been unable to earn a proper wage on piece-work.     It is true that, before the Aot was passed, it was extended to all olasses of under-ground workers, piece-work and day wage, and that, for day-wage men therefore, it did provide, at any rate at pits where rates were lowest, an actual advance in normal wages.     But even so the most It oould do was to level up these &quot;laggards&quot; to a figure being about the average rate of the class in the district, or rather less. It did not, and could not, alter the general level of wages either for the. coalfields as a whole or even in any separate district,     A separate Board for each distriot had to fix the minimum rates of each class of underground workman, and, in doing so, they were directed to &quot;have regard to the average daily rate of wages paid to the workmen of the class&quot;.In south Wales the minimum rates were fixed at or about the average of the current rates of each class and so affected a comparatively large number of men.     In other districts they were fixed below the average, and affected &amp; smaller proportion of men.
The essential points of the Act -were(a) that there were to be separate rates for each class ineach district j(b) that the. amounts were to be fixed with reference torates generally current in the district.The great difference of the present Bill is that it definitely sets out to raise the rates generally current. Its promoters may say that they are laying down only minimum rates, not actual rates, and that in fact the average value of these new minimum rates is very little, if at all, in excess of present average (adult) earnings.     But that does not alter the fact that this Bill would raise the general level of wages very considerably.It should be noted in the first place that it takes no account of present differences in wage-rates as between districts, nor, except to a very small extent, as between different classes of men.      The figure of present average earnings not only represents earnings as distinguished from rates, but is made up from the earnings of an enormous number of differently-paid classes, scores of which are below the appropriate figure proposed in this Bill.     When all these rates are brought up to the new figure, obviously the average earnings are largely increased.     But that is not all.      In practice it would next be necessary to grade upwards from the 10/- surface minimum figure, so as to preserve something like the present proportionate differences between the rates of different classes - probably to such an extent that the 11/- or in any case the 12/-, figure for underground men would in practice never be operative at all. The process of grading upwards would at once put the 12/- up to something higher.      And there would then be the question of piece-rates to be adjusted.       With the increase in the piece-workers minimum there   would   at   once
be a reduction in rate of output. To meet this, piece-work rates would have to be increased.As regards its effect upon the wages now current in the industry,  the following figures may be quoted:-	Present wages rate of lowest paid men.	Percentage Increase over lowes t pre-war rate.	Average earnings of all classes last quarter 1924.	Percentage increase over pre-war .Northumberland.	7/7f	73*g	9/5	52%	7/6*	641% -    -	10/-	61%South Wales . . .	8/0f	5Qt%	10/10*	ei%Yorkshire &amp;				East Midlands.	7/5  - 7/8	60% - 79$	11/8	76%Lancashire etc.	7/6*	115*$	10/0f	67%	7/10*	105-1%	10/8 -	58%Other Districts	varying	i...........: ... , .--......--	9/5	71%These figures show only (a) the lowest adult rate and (b) the average earnings of all classes and ages.     It is Impracticable to give similar figures for all the different classes in the different districts.     But it will be seen that sb regards the lowest paid men the Bill would mean an increase of about 2/- - 2/6d per day (and incidentally that in many districts the minimum rate proposed even for the lowest paid surface hands would itself be as much as, or more than,  the present average earnings of all classes -even after making allowance of boys and youths).      It is probably safe to assume that by the time the necessary grading-up from the lowest paid men had taken place, it would mean a total increase equal to   not less   (if not more) than about 3/- per ton.      The average profit on the working of
the last 8 months of 1924 l.e. the currency of the present agreement was 3d. per ton.     Out of this there is taxation, interest on loans etc.  to be paid.      Where an additional 3/-  (or whatever the exact figure would be) is to come from it is impossible to see.     Even at present wages pits are closing down and men being thrown out of work. Mr. Walsh&apos;s proposals moreover would hit hardest the districts in which wages at present are lowest and which would be least able to pay the new minima.     The impossibility of improving the position of the general body of workmen merely by increasing their rates, without regard to the conditions of the industry, is illustrated by the figures of 1924.     Wages rates were increased as from 1st May, and average earnings per shift during the rest of the year were about&quot; 7d higher than in the first four months.      But owing to declining trade, accentuated by the higher wage-rates, with consequent short-time, actual earnings for the second period were at approximately the same annual rate as in January - April.     And this  takes no account of the large numbers of men who were thrown out of employment altogether.
