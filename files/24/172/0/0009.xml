PRETORIA,January, 192 5.MINUTE NO,  63.Referring to the Governor-General&apos;s Confidential Minute Hp.23/569 of the 27th December 1924, it is noted that the British Government shares in the&apos; view that at this stage the proposal for a special enquiry in connection with the present syBtem of consultation on matters of foreign policy and general Imperial interest is not likely to prove of any advantage,-MINISTERS desire to avail themselves of the present opportunity of submitting to the British Government that accords ing to their views the difficulties which have been encountered in making the present system of consultation effective, are due, not so much to any inherent defect in the system itself, as to-the failure, in the case of negotiations with foreign powers, to insist upon the recognition by such powers of the fundamental fact upon which that system is based, viz: that every member of the Commonwealth by itself constitutes a distinct National entity with equal Status.MINISTERS are of opinion that experience during the last years has shown that while the members of the Commonwealth have inter se acceded wholeheartedly to this view and have formed&apos;it the basis for joint consultation and common action in relation to foreign affairs and common interests, they have, in the event of opposition by foreign powers to its application, not shown themselves prepared to give it the measure of support necessary to overcome that opposition.As a result, foreign powers, whenever they find it:    -:; V&apos;\:&apos;    -convenient or to their interest to have the Dominions excludedfrom participating in any negotiations as distinct nationalentities refuse to recognise their distinct existence;    and, asa consequence, wherever this refusal ultimately prevails - asin the recent Conference over the Dawes Report - the system of consultation and representation necessarily cannot be giveneffect to.94
This is felt as creating a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs;    for no matter what may be the responsibility incurred by a Dominion through its share in any Joint Consulta-tion with other members of the Commonwealth upon a matter of foreign affairs, it is Ultimately left to the discretion of the foreign power concerned to say as to whether such a Dominion shall he barred or not from actual participation in the final decision.MINISTERS feel convinced that the only remedy that, can be applied here is whenever opportunity arises, to insist that the distinct Status of every Dominion and its right to separate individual representation shall be recognised by foreign powers concerned.     Unless this attitude is frankly adopted in our relations with foreign nations and the correctness of - it recognis-ed by these nations, it is felt that all efforts to devise methods of closer co-operation In matters of foreign policy must of necessity prove fruitless.&quot;While the international recognition of the Status of the Dominions as distinct nations entitled to separate representation in the case of international negotiations, seems to this Govern-ment so &amp;ssential as to constitute a condition precedent to the success of any attempt at a satisfactory method of consultation upon foreign affairs and general Imperial interest, MINISTERS feel satisfied that it will at the same time prove of incalculalSe value in removing suspicion and thereby many of the difficulties at present constantly interfering with the speedy determination of international questions.     As between the different members of the Commonwealth the definite and explicit recognition of the international status of the individual Dominions cannot but load to a most salutary increased measure of confidence.    But that will, not be all.      Such international recognition of individual status must necessarily reflect upon and enhance the collective status of the Commonwealth, and force upon the world an inter-national recognition of the Commonwealth relationship to which international law will eventually be forced to adjust itself,J.B.M.HERTZOC.3 -
APPENDIX,Copy of Despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Cjanada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and the Irish Free State,  and the Governor of Newfoundland.(Por copies of previous correspondence v/ith the Dora-inions on the subject see Crhd. 2301 of December, 1924).-. -.&apos; --&quot;&apos;.;.&apos;!&quot; v!&apos;&quot;-&apos;/      - - -: - -&apos;t . -;&apos; -f     .&apos;,..-!...r&apos;,.-.i-&apos;Downing Street \] 2nd December, 1924*My Lord, Sir,I have the honour to request  (Your Excellency)  (you) to inform your Ministers that His Magesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration the suggestion of their predecessors that an inquiry might be held in connection With the present system of consultation on matters of foreign policy and general Imperial interest - vide Mr.  Ramsay MucDonald&apos;s message of the 23rd Junex.2.    The resulting correspondence, which has already been com-municated to your Ministers,  disclosed considerable doubt as to the advisability of taking action in the sense suggested In Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s message.    It was generally agreed that the time had not come to revive the idea of a special Constitutional Conference, though ultimately and after some hesitation participation in a preliminary inquiry was accepted in principle by all the Dominions., provided that a convenient time could be found-    It had not,however, been found possible at the time of the dissolution of Parliament to make any arrangements for the holding of such a preliminary inquiry, chiefly owing to the difficulty of fixing a date which would be suitable for all the Governments concerned.3*   His Majesty1s present advisers are very sensible of the importance of the issues involved; they find themselves fully in agreement with the principles of consultation and concerted action set out in the opening sentences of Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s message and they are determine.&apos; to carry out those principles to the utmost.    But, whilst difficulties undoubtedly exist in making the present system of consultation fully effective, Eis Majesty1^ Government have grave, doubts whether some of the suggestions set out in the latter part of Mr.  Ramsay MacDonald!s message would improve the present system;    they also question whether at the present stage an inquiry of the nature suggested would lead to any practical result,4*    Mr.  Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s message made special reference to the Resolution en the negotiation,  signature and ratification of Treaties passed at the Imperial Conference of 1923, and suggested that further examination of the Resolution might be worth while, in order to consider how far the Resolution needed to bo supple-mented and interpreted,  and.whether the principles embodied in it could usefully be extended to other matters affecting foreign relations.      On this point,  in particular, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that the time which has elapsed since the Resolution was passed is hardly sufficient to enable any very definite opinion to be given.      For themselves, they would prefer to defer a considered judgment until they have had an opportunity of studying for a longer period the wo king of the Resolution In practice.x   No.1.
;5o      For these reasons His Majesty^ Government doubt whether there would be any advantage in pursuing further,, at this stage, the proposal for a special inquiry into the matters referred to in Mr,  Ramsay MacDonald1s message.      On the other hand I need hardly add that, in carrying out the policy of working in concert with the Dominion Governments in all matters affecting foreign relations and the common interests of the British Empire, they desire to avail themselves of every opportunity that may present itself for personal consultation &quot;between Ministers or with such other representatives as the Dominion Governments may at any time wish to entrust with the task of representing their own views or of ascertaining, those of the British Government.6.       There is one pressing matter raising issues which affect the vital interests of the whole Empire, on which personal consultation is., in the view of His Majesty1^ Government, essential.    I refer to the Protocol for the pacific settlement of International disputes. With regard to the arrangements to be made for securing personal consultation His Majesty5s Government hope to communicate with your Ministers at a very early date,I have, etcL.S. AMERYoU5.
