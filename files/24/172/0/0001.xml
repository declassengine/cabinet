[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1-Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 101 (25). [C 2426/70/62]COHERING NOTE.AN important and, it may Jbe, a contested decision must be taken at the forthcoming Council meeting of vhe.-League of Nations on the question whether or not a unanimous vote is to be jtafen wfeWlthe Council has to reach a decision (a) as to the composition of commissions of investigation into the armaments of ex-enemy States, and (b) as to&apos; tbA action to be taken on the reports of the commissions of investigation.I therefore circulate (1.) A memorandum giving the ^history of the question to the end of theCouncil meeting in December last. (2.) An opinion by the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office.The &quot;War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry have concurred in Sir C. Hurst&apos;s opinion, by which I propose to be guided when the matter comes up again at Geneva.A. C.a-)Decisions of the Council of the League on Reports of Investigations into the A armaments of ex-Enemy Countries.ON the 27 September, 1924, the Council of the League approved a scheme of &apos;&apos; organisation with a view to the exercise of the right of investigation in the four States subjected to investigation by the Treaties of Versailles, Saint-Germain, Trianon and Neuilly.&quot; A copy of the scheme is attached. Certain points were, however, still left unsettled and, at the request of the. War Office, the following item was pla,ced by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the agenda of the December meeting of the Council:  -&quot; Organisation with a view to the exercise of the right of investigation in the four States subjected to investigation by the Treaties of Versailles, Saint-Germain, Trianon and Neuilly.&quot;The particular points upon which the decision by the council was required were whether or not a unanimous vote is to be taken when the council has to reach a decision (1) as to the composition of commissions of investigation, and (2) as to the action to be taken on the reports of the commissions of investigation.2. The matter was considered by Sir C. Hurst and the various interested Departments, and on the 9th December the Secretary of State made a statement to the council to the following effect :-&apos;&apos; By the peace treaties the ex-enemy countries undertake to give every facility in any investigation which the Council of the League of Nations, acting, if need be, by a majority vote, may consider necessary.&quot;It is therefore certain that when the council has to decide whether or not an investigation is necessary, it has to proceed by a majority vote. The question is whether (1) the composition of the commissions of investigation, and (2) the action to be taken on the reports of the commissions of investigation, should also be decided by majority, or by unanimity.2696    [12720]
&quot;I am advised that it is doubtful whether article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, and the similar articles in the other treaties, can be held to introduce a majority rule in connection with the League&apos;s investigations to a greater extent than the letter of the article indicates. If, therefore,, these articles of the peace treaties cannot be held to introduce the majority rule save where the necessity or otherwise of the investigation is under discussion, the other matters in question must be decided by article 5 of the covenant.&quot; The first two paragraphs of article 5 run as follows : Except where otherwise expressly provided in this covenant or by the terms of the present treaty, decisions at any meeting of the assembly or of the council shall require the agreement of all the members of the League represented at the meeting.     :\&quot; &apos; All matters of procedure at meetings of the assembly or the council, including the appointment of CommitieeS; to investigate particular matters, sJidll be regulated by the assembly of^bjj the council, and may be decided by a majority of the members of the &quot;League represented at the meeting.&apos;&apos;&apos; Of the two special cases raised by the British Government, the first, i.e., the decision as to the composition of a commission of investigation, can be held to fall within the matters of procedure,dealt with in the second paragraph of article 5, and as such would be determined by a majority.&quot; The second point, i.e., the decision as to the action to be taken on the report of a commission of investigation, would seem to be by the first paragraph of article 5 a question upon which the council&apos;s decision must be unanimous.&quot;3. The Secretary of State&apos;s statement met with no objection so far as his first point was concerned, viz., that majority decisions will be sufficient for choosing members of a commission of investigation. This point was agreed to. The second point, however, that the council must vote by unanimity when deciding what action is to be taken on the reports of sub-commissions, caused considerable apprehension to the French delegate. He pointed out the consequences which might ensue if the British thesis was accepted. The words he used are of sufficient importance to be quoted in ewtenso: &quot; Suppose,&quot; he said, &quot; for example, the council decided by a majority that a serious situation had arisen and that an investigation should be held. Suppose the council for this purpose set up a commission. This commission would proceed to the spot, and might bring to light facts of the utmost gravity, amounting to a formal breach of the treaties. It might discover a whole series of acts calculated to trouble the peace of the world, and might present a report to that effect. What then could be done? If it were possible for only one member of the council to declare that no action should be taken as a result of such a report, the council would be rendered powerless. It would have decided by a majority upon an investigation and would have appointed a commission by a majority, and this commission would have drawn attention to very serious facts.&quot; The whole of the council, on being notified of these facts, with the exception of a single member, might consider that it was advisable to take action in the interests of the peace of the world. As, however, unanimity did hot exist, the council would be unable to act. Such appeared to be the consequences of ah interpretation in this sense.&quot; The case would be even more serious, and would result almost in a state of chaos, if for the sake of hypothesis it were supposed that the Geneva Protocol had been adopted. In this case, not only would the council be prevented from taking action, but also, if the interested Power, on being informed that the council could do nothing, took action on its own account to safeguard its existence, this Power might, under the terms of the protocol, be regarded as an aggressor, in spite of the fact that it had respected the treaty which had been violated by the country to whose action the attention of the council had first been drawn.&quot; Doubtless a jurist might be consulted, but if the jurist were to lay down that under the first paragraph of article 5 of the covenant, failing an express provision to the contrary, a decision by majority was impossible, this would imply that the League of Nations would be unable to act in the execution of one of the most important duties assigned to it by the treaties of peace.
(2.)Opinion by Sir C. Hurst on the Powers of the League of Nations under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles. (Extract from Foreign Office Letter to War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry, of January 27, 1925.)1. Mr. Chamberlain is advised that the French Government are pushing this question of the action to be taken in pursuance of reports under article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles unduly. The question as placed before the council at the sugges-tion of His Majesty&apos;s Government was whether the Council of the League must take a unanimous decision &quot;as to the action to be taken on the reports of the commissions of investigation.&quot; Attention thereby became concentrated on the question whether unanimity was or was not required as to taking any such action. No adequate attention was paid to the question, which is really more important, what action, if any, it is within the power of the Council of the League to take when they have received a report from a commission of investigation appointed under article 213.2. No provision in the Treaty of Versailles, Part V, or in the Covenant of the League of Nations, confers any general power upon the League or upon the Council of the League to enforce the provisions of treaties in general or of the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles in particular. What article 213 does is to confer upon the Council of the League the power to hold investigations, i.e., to enquire into and determine the facts.3. The military, naval and air clauses of the Treaty of Versailles providing for the disarmament of Germany fall into two groups: (a) those which impose a transitory obligation upon Germany which she was bound to fulfil within a limited period, and (b) those which impose upon her permanent obligations, such as the provision relating to the construction or acquisition of submarines or that relating to compulsory military service. Special Organisations were set up to control the execution of the transitory clauses (see article 203), and for the permanent clauses the League of Nations was given the right of investigation. This right of investigation is the sole function conferred upon the League in connection with Part V (the military clauses).4. One of the great difficulties in the way of any scheme for the limitation of armaments is the difficulty of ensuring its observance, and the chief difficulty in the&quot; He would, accordingly, ask that this grave question should not be too quickly settled, and that before a solution was reached, which would be obligatory for all the members of the council, the matter should be very thoroughly considered.&quot; It would also be well that the attention of the Governments should be drawn to this problem before the council was called upon to take a final decision. The question was extremely serious, and the peace of the world was certainly involved.&quot;4. The Czechoslovak delegate reminded the council that this problem had already been examined at Geneva at the time when the Geneva Protocol was adopted. The protocol in such cases contemplated a two-thirds majority. If the protocol came into force, the situation would thus be. less dangerous. (The article of the protocol to which M. Benes was referring is article No. 8, which reads : &quot; The signatory States undertake to abstain from any act which might constitute a threat of aggression against another State.&quot; If one of the signatory States is of opinion that another State is making preparations for war, it shall have the right to bring the matter to the notice of the council.&quot; The council, if it ascertains that the facts are as alleged, shall proceed as provided in paragraphs 2, 4 and 5 of article 7.&quot;The procedure provided for in paragraphs 2, 4 and 5 of article 7 is decision by two-thirds majority.)5. At the end of the discussion in the council, it was agreed that the question should be referred to the Governments, who would be able to give it careful consideration before taking a decision at the March session.Central Department, January 1, 1925.
way of ensuring observance is the difficulty of getting at the truth. Presumably, therefore, it was considered by the f ramers of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles that if the League was given a power which would enable it to investigate the facts and get at the truth, the probability of Germany violating the disarmament clauses would be greatly minimised, if not entirely removed.5. The Treaty of Versailles has no status different from other treaties, and the League of Nations has not been given any general function or duty of enforcing the provisions of all treaties. The action which the council can take on the report of a commission of investigation is thus very limited. Such a report will establish the fact whether or not a breach of the treaty has been committed. The type of decision which can then be taken by the council is, for instance, to publish the report, or to communicate it to all the other members of the League, or to consider the question of strengthening the machinery for making further investigations in the future. The council certainly has not the power of setting all the other members of the League in motion for the purpose of applying coercion to Germany merely because she has broken a treaty engagement.6. It is no doubt because no such power is conferred upon the League by the terms of the covenant or by the Treaty of Versailles that the French Government have been anxious to bring into this discussion, as to the unanimity required in respect of article 213, the provisions of the protocol recently signed at Geneva. That protocol contains an article which, if it came into force, and if the breach of Germany&apos;s treaty engagements which had been brought to light was of sufficient importance to constitute a threat of war, would give the Council of the League power to institute coercive action (see articles 7 and 8). But those articles stand quite apart from article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles and from the question whether unanimity is or is not required in connection with action to be taken on a report under that article.7. &quot;What, then, is the position where an investigation ordered by the council under article 213 results in the establishing of some violation by Germany of her treaty engagements under the military, naval or air clauses of the Treaty of Versailles ? It is that Germany has violated the engagements which she has entered into with the other parties to the Treaty of Versailles. There would then arise between them and Germany a dispute, but it is a dispute in which the League of Nations will not play the part of a party to the dispute. The role of the League will be that of endeavouring to prevent war and of bringing the parties to the dispute to an amicable solution. The parties to the dispute will be Germany on the one side and one or more of the Allies on the other. The role of the League under article 213 will have been fulfilled by its enquiry into and determination of facts, and its role under the articles of the covenant as an organisation for endeavouring to bring the disputants to a harmonious conclusion of their quarrel will begin. The Council of the League will then act under article 11 of the covenant (which necessitates the concurrence of the parties to the dispute in any action thus taken, as well as the unanimity of all other members of the League represented on the council) or under article 15, which excludes the parties to the dispute from the calculation with regard to unanimity and provides also what is to happen if the non-parties to the dispute cannot arrive at a unanimous conclusion among themselves.8. Finally, it may be said that one of the fundamental principles upon which the League is based is that the members will promote international co-operation and achieve peace and security by a scrupulous respect for treaty obligations (see the preamble to the covenant). There is, therefore, an obligation upon all members of the League to co-operate in securing the observance of treaties. Consequently, a member of the council may be held to be under an obligation not to take any such action as that of rejecting a report of a commission of enquiry or refusing to put it on record, or refusing to publish it where the circumstances warrant publication, if a breach of treaty obligations is brought to light. That is the method by which the Council of the League enforces a treaty, not by the application of coercion or by setting in motion the armed forces of the individual members of the League.9. Corsequently, it may be doubted whether any difficulty would be entailed in practice by holding to the rule of unanimity when the council has to decide upon the action to be taken on a report of a commission of investigation. Unanimity in the council should not, in fact, have the vital and deleterious effect which the French appear to apprehend.o
