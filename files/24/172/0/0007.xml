,&apos;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos; S j&amp;VERNMENT 3.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I,      The first part of the Treasury memorandum circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. 99 (25)) deals with the question whether legislation will he necessary for the revival of the Tuberculosis Order, 1914, and ?se have no comment to make on It.2.      But we find ourselves In disagreement with the proposal in the second part that th6 Exchequer grant towards the compensation payable by Local Authorities should be cut down from 75$ to 50% of the gross compensation.5.       We do not share the view expressed by the Treasury thai: an Exchequer grant exceeding 50$ will lead to extravagance. We believe that the fact that Local Authorities will have to pay 25$ minus salvage but plus administrative costs will certainly make them very careful what claims they admit. -   We are confirmed in this belief by the fact that when the Order was in operation on a 75% *- 25^ basis, the valuation placed on the animals was a low one .U4,      The&apos;important question, however, la whether at a time when the public are taking a much greater Interest In a pure milk supply we should propose to do less than was done In 1914. The Exchequer contribution was in that year raised to 75$ because tha previous Order had been almost a dead letter in Scotland, a large number of the Scottish Authorities having refused to work that Order at all on the basis of an Exchequer(EGRET..P. 107(25).CABINET.MILK LEGISLATION.
grant of one half ttie net compensations     $hat chance ia there now that they would agree to anything less than the 1914 terras? And how can a number of Local Authorities in practice be compelled to work such an Order against their will?5.       Whatever may be the merits on general grounds of keeping Exchequer grants down to 50$, we must have an Order which will work; and as far as experience enables us to speak positively we believe that with an Exchequer contribution of only 50$, the Order would not be put into operation by a large number of Local Authorities.6.      Our objective is to eradicate tuberculosis from our herds.     We can only achieve it by a general attack throughout the whole country.     If, owing to lax administration nothing effective is done over a considerable area, much of the expenditure of the Local Authorities who work the Order will be wasted because their districts will continue to be subjected to infection from the unclean areas.7.       We hope, therefore, that the Cabinet will agree to an Exchequer contribution of 75$.N,C ,E.F.L.W.23rd February, 1925.
