[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]   rjPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1925.SECRET. Copy No.O.P. 156 (25.)CABINET.Construction of Extensional Section of Floating Dock.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I CIRCULATE herewith an official letter sent by the Admiralty to the Treasury asking sanction for proceeding at once with the construction of the extensional section of the Floating Dock for Singapore. This seems to me to follow directly from the recommendations already made by the Committee to push on with the arrangements for this Dock with the object of its being in operation by April 1928.It will be seen from the annexed letter that by waiting until the Naval Programme Committee have reported we run the risk of postponing the completion of the Floating Dock for a year without gaining any financial advantage.I therefore ask the Cabinet for sanction to proceed with the preliminary work necessary to admit of the construction of the Dock being commenced next July.(Initialled) W. C. B.Admiralty, S.W. 1, March 12, 1925.Enclosure. Admiralty to Treasury.(No. S. 1258/25.)Sir, Admiralty, March 11, 1925.I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, that, among the items of the New Programme of Shipbuilding proposed to be commenced in 1925-26, was one for the construction of an extensional section required for ex-German Floating Dock No. VII, in order to accommodate British Capital Ships therein. The provision proposed to be taken for this service in 1925-26 was  175,000, of which  80,000 was for Dockyard Labour, chargeable to Vote 8, Section I,  70,000 for Materials, chargeable to Vote 8, Section II, and  25,000 for auxiliarv machinery, chargeable to Vote 8, Section III, Sub-head B. As a decision has not yet been given on the New Programme of Shipbuilding proposed for 1925-26, no provision has been taken for this work in the Estimates about to be presented to Parliament, which have now gone to press.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government, have, however, on the 2nd March, approved of a programme of work on the site at Singapore where this Floating Dock is proposed to be stationed. This programme is designed for completion in 1927-28 so that the Dock may be put in operation by April 1928. In order that the Dock may be at Singapore when required for this purpose, and that suitable conditions of weather for the voyage thither may be ensured, it will be necessary for it to be ready to be towed out by the Spring of 1927. This entails preliminary work and the ordering of materials at a very early date, so that the actual construction of the Dock may be commenced in July next.3  I am to request, therefore, that you will move Their Lordships of the Treasury to give their sanction at a very early date to the construction of the dock section to make No. VII Dock suitable for use at Singapore. [12838 b]
4 The total cost of the work is estimated at  310,000, of which  175,000 is estimated to be required in 1925-26, the incidence of this sum on the several sections of Vote 8 being as stated in paragraph 1 of this letter. No provision having been made for the work, My Lords propose to include it in a Supplementary Estimate to be laid before Parliament at a later date when a decision respecting the New Programme of 1925-26 has been given, if funds are not otherwise available, and in the meantime to inform Parliament of the action proposed.I am, &amp;c. (Signed) O. MURRAY.
