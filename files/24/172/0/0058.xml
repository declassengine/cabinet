(This document is the property of .His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government),CABINET.q o -CRET.P. 158 (25). LICENSING REFORM.Further Memorandum by the Home Secretary.Since I wrote my memorandum of the 13th instant I have seen the Lord. Privy Seal and discussed with him his memorandum of the 10th instant.      I have also seen Lord Lamington&apos;s Question in the House of Lords, which is much more limited than I imagined from Lord Salisbury&apos;s note.It is as follows&quot;To ask His Majesty&apos;s Government whether they will &quot;have an enquiry on the different systems of dis-&quot;interested management of licensed houses,  and in &quot;particular on the licensing system in Carlisle, as &quot;was agreed to by His Majesty&apos;s Government last July &quot;and accepted by this House without a division;    and &quot;to move for Papers.&quot;While I still feel a personal objection to holding any enquiry as to licensing at the present time, I am much impressed by the very awkward position in which the Lord Privy Seal would bo placed if the Cabinet were not to authorise him to make the same answer as he made last year, namely, to assent to a limited enquiry.I think if the enquiry is limited strictly to the terms of Lord Lamington&apos;s Question and a definite decision is taken not to permit its widening,  then a great deal of my objection would disappear.W.J.H.16th March,  1925.
