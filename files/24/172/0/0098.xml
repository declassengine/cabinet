(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY 1S GOVERNMENT ) 0a K C R E T . -   C tP.  198  (25) . C A B  II! E T 3INTERNATIONAL - LABOUR POLICY COMMITTEE ,REPORT tl.o     At their meeting on December 17th, 1924, (Cabinet 67 (24)  6), the Cabinet agreed that a Committee composed of the Lord Chancellor. the Home Secretary, the President of the Board of Trade,  the Minister of Labour and the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should meet to consider the general Government policy on Inter-national Labour Affairs,   &apos; By the Prime Minister1s direction the Parliamentary Secretary*to the Ministry of Labour was subsequently added to the Committee,2-,      The attention of the Committee was in the first-place directed to a general survey of the activities., of the  International Labour Organisation and an examination of the various criticisms which have from time to time been directed against that Body.      In the course of their deliberations the Committee have, been supplied by the Ministry of Labour and others with detailed information a3 to the working of the Or^anisa-. tion and with suggestions for its improvement and also with a confidential Memorandum by Mr. James Lithgow, the President of the &quot;National Confederation of Employers&apos;-Organisations, who has since 1922 been one of the
Employers&apos;  representatives on the Governing Body of the Organisation.     The Committee, subsequently considered the policy to be followed, in the case of the Eight Hours Convention,      In Part  I of this Report the Committee deal with the general question of the attitude to be adopted in future by the British Government towards the Inter-national Labour Organisation and in Part II the Committee make certain r ec ormnenda t i on a respecting the Eight Hours Conventi on,PAjaT   I.3.      The International Labour Organisation was set upin June,  1919,  under Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles,and comprises 58 out of the 66 States in the world.     -Thepopulation of the 58 States in question is 1,300 millions,or 84 per cent of the world population.      The 8 States not members of the Organisation (population about 300 millions)include the United States of America and Russia 04.      No Conventions have been adopted since 1921, but inthe years 1919, 1920 and 1921,  16 Conventions were adopted,,If all the 58 States Members of the Organisation hadratified each of these Conventions there would have been925 ratifications.      The actual number of ratifications upto 31st January,  1925,  is 142  (15^ of the possible number).The 142 ratifications are accounted for by 22 States;19 of these are European States, which between them account for 127 of the 142 ratifications;    the remaining 15 ratifiest ions are  India - 8; Japan. 5; South Africa - 2.    36 states have not yet ratified any one of the 16 Conventions..      These36 States include Prance and Germany and cover a population(Appendix I)of - fully 650 millions.      The attached chart /hows the rat ifi cation position as on 31st January,  1925.      It will be observed that more than half the Members States have no
ratifications to their credit and that the most generally&apos;accepted Convention,  that dealing with Unemployment, i hes been ratified by only 17 States out of a possible 56.,    Great Britain has so far ratified 7 of the 16 Conventions:    in addition a Bill has just passed through the House of Lords which will enable three Merchant Shipping Conventions to be ratified.5.      At the same time it is pointed out that while the chart accurately represents the number and distribution of the formal ratifications so far registered,  it is hardly fair to regard it as a complete picture of the results achieved by the work of the Organisation.    The Conventions adopted by the International Labour Conferences have undoubtedly been the starting point of a considerable portion of the social legislation passed by various European countries during the last few years, although in many oases the Governments have hot seen their way formally to ratify the Conventions, or the measures actually passed have not conformed precisely to the text of the convention involved-An instance of such legislation is afforded by the laws on hours of work now in force in Belgium, Holland,  Italy and Spain, none of which countries has unconditionally ratified the Hours Convention..

jj MAIN 6.     The principal concrete criticisms which have beenRITICI3MSt THE levelled at the Organisation may be shortly summarisedRGANISA-I0N. aa follows:-(1)    That owing to lack of effective control of the Office and its Director by the Governing Body the efforts ef the Organisation are to a great extent absorbed in political propaganda. (2)    That there is no restriction as to the scope and activities of the Organisation and that consequently subjects are often brought up for discussion which have little or no connection with labour problems. (3)    That Conventions are drafted by the International Labour Office without full and impartial enquiry &apos; or adequate information as to the conditions in the various countries concerned and are often adopted by  the Organisation without any opportunity for their proper examination and elucidation. (4)    That as regards ratification great divergenciesof practice exist between Great Britain and other countries.      In Great Britain the constitutional practice is to pass through Parliament such legislation as may be necessary to bring the law into line with the Convention and thereafter to &apos; ratify the Convention itself.      Moreover,  in Great Britain the text of the particular Convention is regarded as authoritative.      The constitutional practice in other countries is exactly the reverse;-A
in seme countries considerable freedom of adaptation and interpretation ir; held to be justifiable  in converting the te:::t of the Convention into legislation, while,  in eases where existing legislation is considered to carry out the obligation, the legislation differs from the Convention on points which British practice would treat as material in deciding whether ratification was  justifiable. &apos;(5) That while In Great Britain the law is strictlyenforce?,  inter alia by energetic administrative action, in foreign countries laxity of enforcement (whether due to the existence of systems of exception and exemption or to inadequate and. inefficient administration) renders the obligation much less severe than is the case in this country.(6) That under the,common form clause usually inserted in Conventions it Is not practicable for a Convention -which has once been ratified to be denounced until after the expiration of 10 years.(7)  That after taking Into account the difficulties of economically conducting an International Body,  the International labour Organisation is extravagantly administered and that  considerable economies could be effected if the activities of the Organisation were to be strictly limited in  -accordance with the original intentions of the framers of tho Treaty.7, It is difficult to estimate the direct and indirecteffects of the activities of tho International labour Organisa-tion on British industry. ho doubt in so far as those activi-ties have resulted in the promotion and enforcement of
social legislation in backward industrial countries the British manufacturer has been indirectly benefitei to the extent of the addition;,,! burdens imposed on his foreign competitor.      On the other hand there is no doubt that British employers on the whole regard the Organisation with suspicion and dislike.      There is a widespread feeling (for which there Is no doubt some justification) that owing to the manner in which the Organisation is conducted and the essential differences between British and foreign legis-lative and administrative methods British industry is hampered by restrictions from which the foreigner competitor is either altogether free or which he manages to evade. The Committee consider that the adoption and enforcement of the recommendations set out below will go far to meet the present objections to the Organisation while at the same time leaving the British Government completely free to deal with future Conventions on their merits. 8.      The Committee have carefully considered the possibility of securing greater economy in the conduct of the Organisa-tion by the adoption of a drastic policy of expenditure reduction.      In this connection the Committee desire to draw attention to the considerations contained in a Memoran-dum by the Minister of Labour (Appendix II) with which they fina themselves&apos; In general  agreement.     It will be seen that in the year 1983,  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour (Mr.Better ton, M.P), succeeded in prc-curing a reduction of the International Labour Office Budget by more than 2 million Swiss franoa and this year, through the efforts of the British Government Representative supported by the Representative   of the British Employers, the Budget for 1926 shows a reduction on the figure for 1925, a cut of nwarly 300,000 Swiss francs having been made In the original estimates.      In these circumstances it seems to the Committee that there would bo great difficulty in pressing for a further substantial /

The financial benefit to this country would he small, while in the event (by no means improbable) of failure the blow to British prestige would be humiliating, 90      The Committee accordingly recommend :-(l)    That with a view to restricting the future activities of the International Labour Organiba-tion within the limits originally contemplated the British Government Representatives,  in approaching the subjects from tiae to time proposed for discussion, either at the Conference or at the Governing. Body, should ascertain whether the subjects proposed would normally be dealt with by a British department dealing directly with labour or with the specific labour aspect of general problems, and should normally only ass ant to the discussion if the answer Is in the affirmative.(2)    That before a Conference is invited upon a proposal for a Convention,    the British Government Representatives should request that there be submitted to the Conference by each oountry-materially affected by the proposed Convention, a full statement of the industrial position in the industry concerned in each country, the statement in question to be made on the authority of the Government concerned. (3)    That with a view to the effective operation of (2! above the British Government Representa-tives should endeavour to secure -(a)    That the information side of the Office is steadily developed and strengthened as against the side of the Office responsiblefor dealing with propaganda;
(b )    That in the strengthening of the information side -(i)    a very careful survey of all publications issued should  be maintained by the Governing Body; and (ii)    it should be insisted that the provisions in the Standing Orders should be observed, which require full information to be obtained before subjects are placed on the Conference Agenda by the Governing Body, and  that such, information is avail-able to the Members of the Governing Body not less than a month before the meeting. (4)    That in order to ensure so far as possible the effective carrying out of Conventions by countries whose representatives have agreed to suoh Conventions, there should be inserted in each future Convention a provision to the effect that every State ratifying the Convention shall make an annual return,  setting out precisely all exemptions and exceptions granted under the Convention by the State in question,. With regard to Conventions already adopted the Government Body should be invited to prescribe that the annual reports rendered under Article 408 of the Treaty should contain the same information. (5)    That in future Conventions there should be substituted for the existing common form 10 year clause    a provision that any party to it should be at liberty to denounce the Convention at any ti-ve after the expiration of the first 5 years by giving reasonable notice.
(6)    That with a view to securing economical administration close observation should be kept on the various activities of the International labour Office and a steady pressure exerted  to prevent any further increase in the present rate of expenditure.    While some increase of expenditure of an automatic character may be unavoidable on certain items,  a0g0 salary incre-ments,  every opportunity should be seized for effecting counterbalancing economieso      opportunity-nities of this kind will arise as existing enquiries are brought to an end and when vacancies occur on the staff from any cause. (7)    (i)    That in future a Bill giving effect to the terms of a Labour Convention should contain a clause to the effect that the Act shall commence as from the date of the ratification of the Convention and  shall continue to have effect so long es the Convention, shall be binding upon this country.fix)    That on the introduction of such a Bill it should be announced that the Convention will not be ratified until His Majesty1s Government are satisfied that the Convention in question has been or will be ratified by those countries which are the principal industrial competitors with Great Britain in the field covered by the Convention,  including    in the ordinary course Italy, France,  Germany and Belgium and any other country to which the Convention may be specially applicable but not the United States of America. Q
(iii)    That the course indiestea in  (ii) above should be followed b;v the Government in regard to all future Labour Conventions unless either  (a) There is general agreement between Employers and Employed in the industry concerned that the Convention should take effect earlier;    or(b) His Majesty1s Government consider it to be in the national interest of Great Britain to legislate irrespective of the action of other countries.(iv)    That while in cases where existing British legislation carries out the provisions of a Convention the British Government need not bind themselves in advance not to ratify until other countries had done so, the question of delaying British ratification in order to  secure ratification elsewhere would always be considered by the Government of the day.P A R T   IITHE WASHINGTON       10.

APPENDIX II.:?HIS DOCUMEM1 IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.CABINET COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL LABOUR &apos; POLICY. &quot;---MEMORANDUM   BY   THE    MINISTER_OF    LABOUR.SECRET X.L.P.8.1,        The first part of Conclusion 2 of the first meeting of the Committee reads as follows:-   &quot;To request the Minister of Labour to submit to the Committee his suggestions for improving the general organisation of theInternational Labour Organisation.  ,......wThe effective control, in so far as the work and staffing of the Organisation is concerned, is through the Finance Committee of the Governing Body, upon which the British Government have a representative.     From the notes in the attached Appendices A and B, it will be seen that successive British representatives on that Committee have always, and not without success, pressed for economical administration. The question remains whether further economies coupled with a further increase in efficiency are not possible, and by what means this can be attained, 2. It may be admitted at once that though theefficiency of the Office is increasing it has not yet reached the point when even for a cosmopolitan organisation it can be regarded as beyond criticism.   It may further be admitted that if the Office were staffed purely on British principles as a British Department all the work at present performed could be performed by a substantially smaller staff.   It is clear, therefore, that further efforts to secure efficiency and eoonomy are necessary.   These efforts divide themselves into controlling the policy of the Office so that it is brought on to the right lines and, secondly, in seeing that the staff for that policy is adequate and not more than adequate. On the first head it has already been decided by the
Committee that pressure should be put upon the Office to restrict itself to its obvious tasks, and this may be developed in more detail by saying that It should be the business of British representatives to see(a) that the information side of the Office is steadily developed and strengthened as against the side of the Office responsible for dealing with Conventions;(b) that in the strengthening of the information aide -(i) a very careful survey of all publications issued should be maintained by the Governing Body; and(ii)it should be insisted that the provisions in the Standing Orders should be observed, which require full information to be obtained before subjects are placed on the Conference Agenda by the Governing Body, and that such Information is available to the Members of the Governing Body not less than a month before the meeting.Steady and continuous pressure on these lines should shewdefinite results.On the second head, it is doubtful, as will be Indicatedbelow, whether effective cuts In the numbers of the staff employed could be carried through, but it should at least be possible to insist on the following policy ^(a) to see that the existing salary bill represents roughly the stabilised figure (subject to Cof L, variations which occur automatically) for the salaries of the staff subject possibly to a small addition for increments;(b) in consequence, attempts to increase this figure should be steadily resisted from year to year; and(c) opportunity should be taken as resignations or other vacancies in the staff occurred to consider whether the   vacancies should be filled.3. The policy outlined above is not drastic.   It is,however, suggested that a more drastic policy would not belikely to succeed, and for the following reasons-2-

The policy outlined above is not drastic.   It is,however, suggested that a more drastic policy would not belikely to succeed, and for the following reasons:--2-
(a) It must be remembered in the first plaoe that Great Britain has only one Government vote on the Governing Body out of 24.   Of the remaining votes, theaix Workersr votes will always be opposed to any reduction In the sphere of the Office and any consequent reduction in expenditure.   Of the six Employers&apos; votes, it is never 3afe to count on more than one, namely, the British Employerfs.    Of the Governments, a proportion, seeing that the sums involved are small, are always willing to vote for the full budgets either beoause they wish to curry favour with the Labour   Parties in their own countries or sometimes because of an anti-*BritIsh bias.   It is probably true to say that of the 24 members of the Governing Body not more than three or four are seriously concerned with securing either the efficiency of the Office as we understand it or the economy which might help to promote that efficiency.(b) But even if a more drastic polioy were likely to succeed it should be remembered that the Office is in any case a cosmopolitan one with a Latin Director and with a considerable French element.    It is clearly impossible to attempt with varying national standards to run an office as cheaply or as efficiently as any office run on one national basis.   But even allowing for some necessary difficulties in this regard, it must further be remembered that the real reductions can only be effected by a substantial reduction of staff.   Upon this, it should be remembered that the staff, with the exception of the Director and Deputy Director, have a twenty-one years contract.
The contract provides for compensation on lc-ss of office, but nevertheless a drastic cut would involve great personal difficulties and accusations of breach of faith.   Nor must it be forgotten that in 1923 when the British did effeot a substantial out a number of the staff were dismissed and a feeling of bitterness and Insecurity was created.   To repeat that action within two years would, it Is suggested, be both unfair to the Officers and to the work unless the movement is a firm and final one made in such a manner as to be assured of success In reducing the expenditure to a level, which will be a more or less permanent settlement.   It oan hardly be expected that with the persistent threat of dismissal hanging over their heads the Officers concerned would turn out the best work of which they are capable.(c) It must not be supposed that the Report by Mr,Watson, to which reference Is made in the Annex to the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum, had no results.    In the first place, the reductions obtained in 1923 were only made possible by virtue of the existence of that Report.   In the next place it is the fact that in the progressive reorganisation of the Offloe the main principles outlined In Mr.Watson1s Report have been kept in mind and to a certain extent followed,     An important instance Is provided by the arrangement for a central secretariat which was one of the main features of Mr.Watson&apos;s Report.   Thi3 proposal was made by Mr.Watson as a means of drawing together the work of the Office and of eliminating, if possible, the Director&apos;s &quot;cabinet&quot;.    The &quot;cabinet&quot; has in fact not altogether disappeared but has been substantially reduced
ana a central administration section has been established which is justifying its appointment.Moreover, it should be borne in mind that Mr.Watson throughout his Report called attention to the real difficulties presented by the cosmopolitan nature of the Office and the special conditions which applied to an organisation under the direction of a Body consisting of Governments, Workers and Employers.   Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the Office is still suffering from personnel which was brought in  . at the time of the signature of the Treaty as a concession to the various national prejudices.   Certain of the Officers appointed had no qualifications whatever for the posts to which they were assigned and though they are gradually being, weeded out in every case, national prejudices have to be overcome before they can be dismissed,   a striking example is an Italian Officer in charge of one of the two Intelligence Divisions,   By common agreement he is regarded as inefficient but when an attempt was made to arrange for his departure, the strongest possible objection was taken by M,Mussolini personally, who indicated that he would regard any such change as an affront to Italy,(d) Finally, as stated above, the best way of keeping the staff within reasonable limits is to see that the work is kept within such limits.   An$ attempt to cut down the work is always regarded by a majority of the Governing Body as an attack on the Office.   Accordingly, the easier plan) and the one in the eVd more likely to succeed is for the future rigidly to watch new developments, bearing in mind the general definition of the tasks of the Office, which have been proposed in another paper.
4. The conclusion upon this head, therefore, Is that if great Britain had a free hand, and if conditions were favourable, we should&apos;be glad to see further reductions in the expenditure of the Office.   As things are, it seems extremely difficult to obtain any such reduction unless it were obtained by means which would be certain to succeed and which would settle the matter once and for all.   The only possible means to this end would be for a definite agreement to be reached by the great Powers, namely, Great Britain, Prance, Italy, Belgium and perhaps Japan, by which a definite figure for the Office would be settled, or, alternatively a Commission of Enquiry would be demanded.   Such a course could only be arranged by previous diplomatic action and it would be essential that the representatives of all these Governments should come to the meeting with firm instructions.   It may, however, be questioned -whether, in the present state of opinion with regard to the League generally, the moment for such action is suitable.   It. must not be forgotten that it is a common complaint by the French against us that whereas the British Government is constantly attacking the International Labour Office which has a French Director, no such attacks have ever been made against the League with its English Director.    In this connection, it should be mentioned that in November, 1923, the Ministry raised with the Treasury, the question of further economies in the I.L.O., indicating that if they could be assured of the necessary diplomatic support, they would be prepared to work for a substantial further cut in the Budget, down as far as 5,000,000 frcs,   A copy of the correspondence which ensued is attached - Appendix C,   It may be that even this course, which seems to be the only possible course (if drastic action is desired), may not be opportune and that It might be better to wait for the time when the term of office for Monsieur Thomas expires, which would In any case, be a reasonable moment for reviewing the shole position.(Intd.)

APPENDIX BoSTEPS TAKEN BY THE MINISTRY OP LABOUR FOR REDUCTION OF THE EXPENDITURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR OFFICE.Tho British Government have consistently taken steps to reduce the expenditure of the international Labour Office as far aB possible without impairing its efficiency for carrying out the duties assigned to it under the Treaty of Versailles. It may be ef use to indicate the nature of these efforts In reapeet *f the budgets for the years 1925, 1924 and 1925.   A statement is appended giving the figures of recent budgets with brief remarks thereon.in 1922 when the 1923 budget was under oonsideratien Sir Montague Barlow, who was at that time not only the representative ef the British Government f*n the Governing B$*dy but also rapporteur of the Finance Gommittee,  circulated a memorandum to members of the Governing Body emphasising the need for eoonomy.     He succeeded in induoing the Finance Committee to. adopt his motion that the Office should be incited to revise their budget to bring the total down as close to the 1922 budget as possible (7,957,325 Swiss franos),  the Director &quot;having proposed for 1923 a sum of 8,901*780 Swiss francs.     as a result the Governing Body adopted a budget of 8, 532,712 Swiss franc-s, a reduction of 369,068 Swios francs.Sir Montague. pointed out that there had been a tendency in the Governing Body, and more particularly in ths Conference, to arrive at a decision involving expenditure without reckoning the cost beforehand,,   He suggested that it should in future be made a definite rule included in the Standing Orderb that no decision involving expenditure should be taken without a report being first called for from the Finance Committee as to the cost entailed.    This proposal was accepted./At
At the January 1933 session of the Governing Body %hQ Director of the international Labour Office proposed to utilise the vote of 200,000 Swiaa franoa set aside in the 1923 budget for emergency expenditure in the engagement of additional permanent staff.   This proposal was reaiated by the British Government representative and as a result of his opposition it was arranged that the Director of the Office should invite Mr. Watson, the Director of Establishmenta of the Ministry of Labour, to make a detailed enquiry into the staffing of the Offioe.At the April 1983 meeting of the Governing Body Mr. Betterton, who represented the Britiah tfovernmerit, strongly urged that the budget for 1924 should net exceed Q\ million Swiss francs, exolusive of any provision that might be required for compensation on abolition of posts to seoure ultimate economy.     protracted negotiations between the Direotor and Sir Montague Barlow led to the British Government representative accepting by way of compromise at the June session of the Governing Body a total budget of 6,942,295 Swlee francs, as compared with 9,118,780 Swiss franca originally suggested by the Direotor.   Thie sum was increased by the Assembly to 7,032,295 Swiaa franca.   To arrive at this reault it waa necessary for the Office to be re-organised and for a number of dismisaals t** take place partly in accordance with the recommendations of Mr. Watsons report and partly in the light of the experience of the Offioe itself.She effect of the British Governments policy of continually urging the necessity for economy on the Internatio-Labour Offioe was apparent when the Director submitted his proposals for the 1925 budget.   He suggested a figure of 7,574,203 Swiss franos, an increase over the 1924 budget of only 541,908 Swiss francB./Mr. Maodonald&apos;s
Mr. Macdonald&apos;e Government, then In power, decided, however, to pursue the policy of their predecessors and press for all possible economies consistent with efficiency.   A memorandum emphasising the need for retrenchment was circulated to the members of the Governing Body by Miss Sondfield.   As a result the Directors proposals for the addition of 25 new posts oosting in all 273,4B0 Swiss franos were reduced to the creation of 12 new posts and the upgrading of 8 at a total oost of 130,000 Swiss francs,   in the end the Governing Body were Induced to adopt a budget of 7,119,595 Swiss francs, representing a reduction on the Director1a original proposals of 454,60P Swiss franos.   Had the Assembly of the League not seen fit to entrust certain temporary new work to the international Labour Office (a course of action against whioh the British Representative on the Governing Body protested) and to increase its budget by 831,000 Swiss francs for this purpose, the budget for 1925 would still have been lower than the actual expenditure In 1922 and 1925, although the staff had during those years become entitled automatically to a number of increments on their salaries.The proposals of the International Labour Office for the 1926 budget are not yet to hand but it is anticipated that they will not indioate any increase on the present budget, except in so far as they may make provision for the automatic incremental salary increases.
Correspondence with Treasury (November end December 1923) regarding the expenditure of the International LabourThank, you for your letter of 8th December, 1923, about the I.L.0.I realise that last year the Treasury carried the question of economy in the Secretariat and the I.L.O. to the fullest limit that seemed to them possible,     I must say, however, as explained in my previous letter,that to me the position seems to be materially changed by the declarations made and assented to by British representatives at the Council and Assembly.I gaiher you think there is little likelihood of our being able to rely in 1925 on the support of the British Representatives on the Council and Assembly of the League in a general move for economy, such as was contemplated last year.     It seems probable, therefore, as jou say, that we may have to rely on detailed sugges-ti-ons. for particular economies.     We should have no chance of winning on any substantial cuts unless effective support from other nations were previously assured by diplomatic Action, more especially in view of the declarations of last year.     As I see the position now, we should not De able to carry the Governing Body in anything but quite small economies, and as I explained previously we cannot continue to antagonise the other Members of the Organisa- ion.     To do so would re-act detrimentally on our work  here in many ways.     We shall, of course, continue to ^ratch the situation and from time to time seek detailed suggestions for specific economies.Office.I.L.208/1923.28th December, 1923.Dear Bars tow,Yours sincerely,(Sgd) H. J. WILSON.Sir George Barstow, K.C.B H.M, Treasury, S.W.1.
I,L.208/1923. 27th November, 1923.Dear Bars tow.At the end of January, when the Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation next meets, some reference will probably be made to the Budget of the Office for 1925, which, as you know, will have to be adopted by the Governing Body at its April Session in order that it may go through the requisite stages of examination before it is finally voted by the Assembly.2, In connection with the 1925 Budget certain considera-tions of a departmental end political character arise on which I think it desirable to consult you without delay as, in certain circumstances, we ought to be prepared to take action before the January meeting,3. As you are aware, the Ministry of Labour have for sometime felt that the administration of the Office was not free from extravagance *     The efforts of the British Government representatives on the Governing Body to effect retrenchment culminated in March last in the Director&apos;s inviting to Geneva, A, W, Watson, our Director of Establishments, for the purpose of advising him on possible savings in connection with technical questions of office management and establishment.   For Watson to have entered into questions of policy would have doubtless led to more drastic recommendations but he would then have trespassed upon the functions of the Governing Body, who; in theory, have sanctioned each and every activity of the Office and whose sense of sovereignty is readily excited.     Watson recommended to the Director (a) modifications of office pro-cedure whereby substantial savings could be effected and (b) a re-arrangement of duties whereby the savings could be increased by as much again, the total economies proposed amountlrig to about 1^ million Swiss francs on a Budget of approximately 8,000,000 Swiss francs.4, On the basis of Watson&apos;s report we pressed, at lastApril&apos;s meeting, for a Budget for 1924 which should riot exceed 6f million francs but M, Thomas (fortified by the majority of the Finance Committee) was not prepared to accept many of Watson&apos;s recommendations.     With the support of mosi of the Governing Body he resisted the reduction of the credit to the extent proposed.     After difficult and complicated negotiations (which were authorised by the Cabinet) we ultimately accepted with reluctance a Budget amounting to just over 7 million francs. It will be remembered that this figure Includes 200,000 francs of non-recurrent expenditure and compares with the original estimate for 1924 of 9,118,780 francs.     The expenditure in 1922 was 7,300,000 francs..     In so doing we did not contemplate that our right to press for further substantial reductions in the 1925 Budget would be compromised by certain political develop-ments to which I am about to refer.Sir George Barstow, K.C.B., Treasury Chambers,SrW.l.
5 *) 3W tl  ij5.     Throughout the whole of the financial proceedings of the Governing Body no real support, was given to the British Government representative except by members from the British Empire and particularly by Cols Lithgow the representative of the British Employers, nominated by the National Confederation of Employers Organisations, although the French Government representative was prepared to agree, in principle, to the reduction of the 1924 Budget to the level of that of 1923.     After the June meeting (at which the 7 million francs&apos; Budget was voted) the French press and even the reporter to the Budget in the Senate chose to regard British action at Geneva as having been inspired by a desire to embarrass the head of the Office because of his French nationality, and I fear also that the fact that an Englishman had undertaken the inspection contributed to the atmosphere of suspicion and oritloism.     The Reporter reoommended that at the forthcoming Assembly the French Government should retaliate by proposing a similar reduction-tion in the Budget of the Secretariat?   and, as events showed, at the ensuing meetings of the Council of the League and the Assembly the French representatives acted accordingly.6.     Anticipating that this would be the oourse of the events we had suggested to your Department and the Foreign Office, before making our proposals to the Governing Body for retrenchment, that, in order to avoid all accusations of partiality or discrimination, a similar investigation to that undertaken by Watson at the International Labour Office should be carried out in the Secretariat of the League,     Mr, Wood, who at that time had just become the British representative on the Council, did not feel that he had sufficient knowledge of the working of the Secretariat to Justify him in proposing this course to the Council and the suggestion was not acted upon.     When M, Hanatoux, at a subsequent meeting of the Council, moved that the Budget of the League and of the Secretariat in particular should be reduced, Lord Robert Cecil (who had succeeded Mr. Wood as British representative) defended the administration of both organs of the League and expressed misgivings as to the possibility of any substantial retrenchment.   As you will remember, he again expressed these views with vigour when Sir William Joynson Hicks made proposals to the Cabinet for a drastic reduction in the Budget of the League,     The Ministry of Labour still favoured an investl-gation by an expert committee into the staffing and salaries of the League offices but, after due consideration and in view of the very difficult circumstances through which the League was then passing, Lord Robert Cecil felt that he could not appear to throw any discredit upon that institution by proposing investigation either by an ad hoc committee or by the Supervisory Committee,     In the end I understand that arrangements were made whjlch would enable a Treasury representative to be associated with Lord Meston at meetings of the Supervisory Committee,A.
7.     In proposing that an impartial enquiry, free from any suspicion of national bias, should be held, we had hoped to demonstrate to the Governing Body that there was a cause.for further retrenchment.     For we were always conscious that without outside corrobcration there would be great difficulty in obtaining sufficient support from the Governing Body to insist upon a policy of economy in regard to the 1925 Budget, Through circumstances beyond our control, we have failed to secure the inquiry, and the position has been further prejudiced by the following passage In the Report of the Fourth Committee to the last Assembly&quot;Finally, the Pourth Committee is of opinion that the &quot;reductions made in the Budget will not adversely affect &quot;the essential work of the League of Nations.    It is, &quot;however, of opinion that It would be difficult to effect &quot;further economies without endangering the very existence &quot; of the League&quot;.The British Delegation to the Assembly appear to have accepted this paragraph without comment and,   in the circumstances, I see much difficulty in bringing about, at any rate for the time being, an improved administration of the International Labour Office,8.     As you probably know, Colonel Lithgow was a very important factor in bringing about the economies already secured:     I have had some talk with him and find that he Is very much disturbed at tho position In which he now finds himself.     He feels that it is Impossible for him, as an Employer, to lead an attack of this kind on a second occasion, especially in view of the inconsistent attitude of the various British Government representatives.     Whatever we do in the matter, we must see to it that we continue to have Colonel Lithgow&apos;s support if we can   devise means of securing it.9.     If, however, this difficulty can be surmounted and we can rely on the support of the British Representatives at the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations, I should be prepared, notwithstanding the failure to obtain an inquiry, to work next year for a substantial further cut In the Budget-and would have justified it on the broad ground that, under existing conditions of financial stringency, a sum of say five million francs was sufficient to provide an adequately equipped office, capable of undertaking all the duties assigned to it under Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles.    I recognise that our past efforts to economise have not been popular with the Governing Body and that this unpopularity has re-aeted on non-financial questions of interest to the British Government, but notwithstanding this, we are in so small a minority on the Governing Body in matters of economy that, if we desire to secure economies it would be necessary to obtain before the January meeting, through diplomatic channels, the support of the principal States represented on the Governing Body, difficult if not Impossible as the task must appear at the present time.     Without such support I doubt whether it would have been worth the whole of the British representative to incur for the Government the odium of an attempt which would assuredly be unsuccessful.I have written you fully In this way, as I shall be glad to know how the Treasury think that we ought to prepare for^the January meeting and in particular what you think should be the next step.Yours very truly,(Sgd) H. J. WILSON.
I.L.208/1923. TREASURY CHAMBERS,Whitehall, S.W.I.6th December, 1923.Dear Wilson,I have read with great interest your letter of the 27th ultimo on your difficulties with regard to the International Labour Organisation economy, but I am not quite sure -that you have got the complete story of what happened at Geneva. Sir W. Joynson-Hicks&apos; memorandum on economy did not get consid-ered by the Cabinet, but when Lord Robert Cecil left for Geneva he did so with a clear understanding with the Treasury as to the line he was to take.     When the French attack on the Secretariat developed, he was to propose an enquiry into the staffing and organisation of both the Secretariat and the I.L.0* (thus giving effect to your plea for no discrimination) by British and French experts.   The reason this plan did not materialise was political.      It was found that the expert Committee would not get sanctioned without additions, notably an Italian. This was when the Corfu dispute was in full blast and the attitude of France as well as Italy was very doubtful.    The risk that the expert inquiry, on which the British represent -tative would have been in a minority, would be used illegitimately as a lever for destroying the useful functions of the League, appeared very serious to the British Delegate and the Treasury had reluctantly to concur.     So we had to content ourselves with some actual reductions in the Budget and with securing the right to attach technical experts to Lord Meston to assist him when the Supervisory Commission examine expenditure.The Commission meet in the middle of January and we shall shortly have a meeting with Meston to examine the position.   We will tell you when this takes place and I think it would be very useful if you could send some one over.   The Supervisory Commission do not I think, go into the I.L.O. Budget in much detail and I am afraid the primary responsibility for securing economy there will continue to rest with your delegate.   The position does not seem to be changed from last year, except that, although we would prefer the adoption of a round sum for the Budget of the I.L.0, we would be unable to assure you that we could press for a round sum for the Secretariat, and you may,&apos; therefore, have to rely on detailed suggestions for particular economies.     On this it would be very desirable that you should be kept In touch with the corresponding proposals we shall put up with regard to the Secretariat.     If, however, you would be prepared to fight for a round sum,t   we ourselves would prefer that course and hope therefore, that you will.Yours sincerely,-   (Sgd)    G. L. BARSTOW.H, J. Wilson, Esq., C.B., C.B.E.
draft GTAT:;-1::;i;T OH TH3 ffASHII-IGTpir,HOUHS CONVEX TIQIT.His ^aj9Styrs Government have had under consideration the position of Groat Britain with regard to the Washington Convention on hours of work in industry.The practice of British industry already in large measure conforms to the spirit of the Convention and to some extent indeed is ahead of it.    Hot only is it the almost universal custom to fix &quot;by agreement a standard maximum normal working week, and &quot;by agreement to pay extra rates for over-time , hut in almost all industrial undertakings that maximum is 48 hours, or, in a number ox important industries, less. Indeed, the general objects at which the Convention aims have already been at least as completely secured in this country as in any of the countries who participated in tho Convention. The Government are not aware that any representative opinion In the country desires that there should ho any alteration in those agreements in the direction of raising the normal working wook above 48 hours at most.But tho variety of British industries is very great and they have advanced in this matter &quot;by voluntary agreement and by diverse methods,  each adopting such an arrangement of hours as best suits its particular needs.    The terms of the Convention are unfortunately vary precise and rigid, particularly in regard to the limits of daily working hours and the duration, occasion and arrangements of overtime.    It hardly appears to have contemplated tho necessity of providing for continuity of operation in certain industries,  such as railways, or the effects of the British custom of observing a half holiday or,
in some instances , a whole day off in addition to S.unday0 Neither the present nor any preceding Government has found It possible to frame a Bill which will conform to the terms of the Convention in its present form and will not involve the abrogation of existing agreements in important industries and gravely impair, if not destroy, that elasticity and reasonable freedom of self-government , which both employers and employed in British industry rightly prize,,It was for these reasons that His Majesty1 s Government in 1921 suggested consideration of the possibility of revising the Convention in the light of experienceHis Majesty1s Government wish to make it clear that they are in the fullest accord with the aspirations expressed in the Preamble to Part XIII of the&apos; Treaty of Versailles0      In their viewc  the International Labour Organization can and ought to be utilised, more fully than in the past for the purpose of improving the conditions of labour in the more backward countries of the world, conditions which constitute an obstacle in the way of nations whioh, like Great Britain, desire to of..&apos;...at still further improvements in the lot of their own workers.    The Government are not satisfied that as much has been done by way of ratification of conventions by othor countries as could have been done.     While His Majesty1 s Government do not at. present see their way to overcome the difficulties which prevent the formal ratification of the Hours Convention in its present form, it is their intention to oo-oporate to tho fullest possible extent with the International Labour Office in carrying out the principles laid down in Part XIII of the Troaty0
