[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]    9 8Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 110 (25).CABINET.HIGHER COMMANDS IN THE EGYPTIAN ARMY.IN authorising Lord Allenby, as I have done, to accept Sidky&apos;s final proposal, as contained in the penultimate paragraph of the Cairo telegram printed below, I had the following considerations in mind : Shehata Kamel Pasha has been chief military aide-de-camp to the King of Egypt and in that Capacity commanded the Sultan&apos;s bodyguard of cavalry. He was closely connected with Lord Kitchener throughout the latter&apos;s Egyptian campaign, and in contrast to most Egyptians the foreign language he used was English and not French, which he neither spoke nor understood. He is intimately associated with the King, and this association has remained unaffected by, a dispute on a minor matter which arose between them two or three years ago. So far as sympathies in Egypt can count for anything, Shehata is generally credited with well-disposed feelings towards the British, sentiments believed to have been engendered in him by long companionship with them in arms. He therefore appears to be as satisfactory an Egyptian officer as we could find for appointment to a high post of authority in the Egyptian army.As regards the appointment of Colonel Spinks to be acting Adjutant-General, it appears from the last paragraph of Lord Allenby&apos;s telegram No. 67 (circulated in CP. 91 (25)) that the Egyptian Government have already intimated their readiness to appoint this officer to the substantive rank of Adjutant-General on a two-years contract, and to make him definitely second-in-command of the Egyptian army.The results from our point of view of accepting Sidky&apos;s proposal may therefore be summed up as follows: The question of the Sirdarship remains untouohed: Colonel Spinks remains in undisputed authority until a Sirdar is appointed and in a position which virtually assures him the post of second-in-command of the Egyptian army when the appointment to the supreme command is made; and, lastly, Sidky is satisfied.A. C.Foreign Office, February 24, 1925.Annex I..)Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby to Mr. Austen Chamberlain. (Received   ;;) - ; February 20.)(Nos. 78, 79 and 80.) &apos;&apos;(Telegraphic.) Cairo, February 20, 1925.(R.) YOUR telegram No. 57. &quot; fSidky approached me a few days ago with request that no time should be lost in nominating an Egyptian Sirdar.He explained that -in doing so he was moved less by obvious political advantage that Government would derive from such an appointment than by urgent necessity he felt of putting some high officer in whom he could count in a position of authority in the army at present moment.He confessed to feeling some anxiety about the state of mind of the young Egyptian officers in regard to the political situation in general and elections in particular.   There had been some striking cases during the past few days of active2 7 02   [12740]
and open participation in election campaign. He was taking severe measures, but this was not enough. What was needed was someone who could influence the young officers and keep them under close personal control.  (End of Ft.)There was also another aspect of question. Possibility of Zaghlulists provoking troubles in the event of their defeat at elections could not be excluded. Secret reports that reached him tended to show that this was their intention. Again, if elections went against the Government and it was necessary dissolve Parliament a second time possibility of troubles would be greater.He had no reason to think that any trouble would be serious or widespread, but he wished to leave nothing to chance, and to be in a position to deal quickly and firmly with any situation.It was clearly undesirable that British Inspector-General should find himself mixed up in matters which were purely Egyptian party question.(R.) Government&apos;s candidate for post of Sirdar was Sheata Kamel Pasha (until recently the King&apos;s chief aide-de-camp), and on his nomination Colonel Spinks would be appointed Adjutant-General.I explained to him that it was inopportune to raise the question of Egyptian Sirdar at the present moment, and he was quick to appreciate the reasons for this.He then proposed that Sheata should now be appointed Adjutant-General, a post which he could vacate later in favour of Colonel Spinks. As Adjutant-General Sheata would be able to perform the duties of control which were now necessary.I replied that I was unable to acquiesce in this proposal because Sheata was senior to Colonel Spinks, to whom Acting Sirdar had delegated his powers, and there could be no question of delegation of these powers to an Egyptian officer.He begged, nevertheless, that I should submit proposal to you, and indicated that, in so far as Sheata personally was concerned he had acted at the instance of the King, who was particularly anxious to find a post for that officer, and that he -would like to be able to inform His Majesty that he had made an attempt to secure your assent.He himself would be satisfied if some superior Egyptian officer in whom he had confidence were promoted to a post of authority.V He thought that this could be done by appointing Colonel Spinks to be Acting Adjutant-General, a post in which he could be confirmed later, and an Egyptian officer to be Acting Inspector-General. Sidky would thus have the instrument he needed, and in case of trouble Colonel Spinks could give Acting Inspector-General the necessary authority to deal with it.I recommend your acceptance of this last proposal, which would have the double , advantage of giving wider powers to Colonel Spinks and would obviate the not impossible criticism that a British officer in exercise of his duties as Inspector-General was mixing himself up with local politics.   (End of R.)[J 530/133/16] Annex II.Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Field-Marshal Viscount Allenbv (Cairo) (No. 63.) V(Telegraphic.)
