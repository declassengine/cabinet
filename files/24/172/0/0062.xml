(25).THE CABINET.THE ARMY AND AIR FORGE (ANNUAL) BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.It will be within the recollection of my colleagues that when the Army and Air     110 Force (Annual) Bill was before the House last year, the late Government were confronted   General by a series of amendments of a far-reaching and controversial character of which notice     3938 had been given for the most part by members of the Labour and Liberal parties.   The attitude to be adopted by the Government to these amendments was considered by the Cabinet and, in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision, my predecessor announced in debate that although the Government could not accept any of the amendments, the Army Council, with the other Service departments, would, during the ensuing year, examine the proposals made, including the proposal to abolish the death penalty, and report to the Cabinet. 1The interdepartmental Committee, whose report I circulate herewith, was accordingly set up under the chairmanship of Mr. J. J. Lawson, M.P., who was succeeded on the change of Government by the present Financial Secretary of the War Office. The Committee&apos;s report has been accepted by the Service departments, and I propose to include in this year&apos;s Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill the amendments to the Army Act which the Committee recommend.   The draft bill is attached.L. W.-E.The Wae Office,23rd March, 1925.26/Ptg/3ti4   75   3/25   W.O.P.   1768

Draper.TEEMS OF EEFEEENCETo explore the questions affecting the discipline of the Services which were raised by the amendments on the Order Paper of 2nd April, 1924, and to report to the Admiralty and the Army and Air Councils.
REPORTInteoductoey1. Some of the amendments moved in last year&apos;s debate in Committee on the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill have little direct bearing on discipline, but to avoid doubt we have thought it desirable to deal with them all, and they are reprinted, numbered for convenience of handling in a somewhat rearranged order, in Appendix I. The list of witnesses who appeared before us is given in Appendix II.2. For simplicity our Report refers in form to the Army only, but our conclusions on all questions of policy apply also to the Royal Air Force and to the Air Force Act.The Death PenaltyQuestion of its abolition for military offences. (See Appendix I, Amendments Nos. 1-9.)3. The main grounds on which the abolition of the death penalty on active service is urged may, we think, be summarized as follows : That there have been miscarriages of justice owing to failure to distinguish between Teal cowardice and physical breakdown, or owing to harsh or unfair conduct of trials ;That other penalties, combined with moral pressure, would be equally or more efficacious ;And that the code of military law is in itself unduly severe, and is unequal as between officers and other ranks.4. With reg-ard to the first of these contentions, we do not think that any actual case of miscarriage of justice was substantiated before us. The alleged instances which have been brought to our notice are not numerous, and we have found that the particulars given turn out, on comparison with the records of proceedings preserved in the Judge Advocate-GreneraPs department, to be frequently inaccurate or incomplete. The allegations of harshness and unfairness are not supported by any weight of evidence, and we do not think that such charges can stand against the general testimony of service witnesses, given both to us and to Lord (then Sir Charles) Darling&apos;s Committee of 1919,* as to the conduct of courts-martial during the Great War.5. As to the suggested efficacy of alternative penalties, the witnesses who appeared before us, so far as they did not frankly* This Committee was constituted by the Army Council in April, 1919, &quot; to enquire into the law and rules of procedure regulating Military Courts-Martial, both in, peace and war, and to make recommendations.&quot; Its Report was published as Gmd. 428.am)
disclaim all responsibility for finding any alternative, advocated some form of imprisonment (i.e., penal servitude, imprisonment or detention), and it seems clear that this is the only alternative under the Army and Air Force Acts. With the possible exception of cashiering, which applies to officers only, the other available punishments, field punishment No. 1 having been done away with are inappropriate for serious offences.6. On this point there was a consensus of opinion on the part of all the service witnesses of all ranks who were not professed advocates of abolition that penal servitude or imprisonment would have little if any deterrent effect; and indeed, looking to the conditions of modern war, and to the fact that the offender concerned ex hypothesi finds these conditions almost beyond his endurance, it is hard to see how a measure which removes him into safety with a certain prospect of amnesty at the end of the war can in many cases be anything but attractive to him.7. The view that offenders should be left to be dealt with by the moral pressure and example of their comrades has in many cases much force, but very full advantage is already taken of this means of securing discipline. It was precisely with the object of avoiding in this way the infliction of the death sentence and other punishments that the Army (Suspension of Sentences) Acts of 1915 and 1916 were passed, and have since, in substance, been permanently embodied in the Army Act (see Section 57 a).8. But situations arise in war when nothing will avail to preserve discipline but the enforcement of the extreme penalty for offences which endanger the safety of the Army, the success of its operations, and the lives of other officers and men. If no other resource than moral pressure were available one or both of two consequences would ensue. Either the bad example of the offender, coupled with the obvious inability of the authorities to deal with him, might lead to the undermining of discipline and moral, or the comrades of the culprit might take the law into their own bands and shoot him themselves. In either case more suffering, demoralization and loss of life would result than under the present system.9. As to the alleged undue severity of the code, the offences punishable with death are fully and carefully defined. A soldier, for instance, cannot be charged in general terms with the offence of &quot; mutiny,&quot; but only with one or other of the offences specified in detail under that head in Section 7. Again, he cannot be tried for his life, even on active service, simply for the offence of using violence to his superior officer. Under Section 8 (1) the alleged offence must have been committed whilst the superior was &quot; in the execution of his office.&quot; Similarly, dis-obedience to a lawful command is not, as such, punishable with death, even on active service. Under Section 9 (1) it is necessary to prove three further facts, viz. : that the command was given &quot;personally,&quot; that the superior giving it did so &quot; in the execu-tion of his office,&quot; and that the accused disobeyed &quot; in such manner as to show a wilful defiance of authority.&quot;    Disobedience to a
general order, or disobedience, however culpable it might be, which was only due to negligence or self-assurance, would not suffice, unless defiantly persisted in, to bring the culprit within the terms of this narrow definition. The careful definition in the code thus operates for the protection of the individual.10. It is further to be observed that there is under the code no military offence punishable with death for which any of the lesser punishments provided for in the Act may not be awarded instead&apos; at the discretion of the court-martial, and that in cases where a less punishment is thus awarded it cannot in any circumstances be increased by higher authority. But the higher (confirming) authority, or any reviewing authority, may at his discretion reduce a sentence of death to any less punishment; and the Darling Committee emphasised the fact that during the Great War no fewer thau 89 per cent, of the death sentences pronounced were, in fact, so reduced by the confirming or reviewing authority.11. In all the circumstances we do not think it can be contended that the code does not allow freely the exercise of a merciful discretion.12. As to the alleged differentiation in favour of officers, it may be pointed out that all ranks, including officers, are at all times equally required to obey all lawful commands; that in war all ranks, including officers, are equally deprived of the option of leaving the service ; and lastly that all ranks, including officers, are equally liable to incur the death penalty for each of the. offences for which it is authorised.13- Turning to the views of those service witnesses of all ranks who appeared before us as advocates of the retention of the death penalty, we have little to add. Two points should, however, be brought to notice. In the first place, the officers of high rank who were directly charged during the war with the duty of final decision in particular cases, were unanimously of opinion that the death penalty is only required in the last resort and in extreme cases, but that for such cases it must be retained as a power in reserve. Secondly, both these officers and all other ranks regarded the purpose of the penalty not as vindictive, but simply as deterrent. From this point of view the question of the effect of the penalty on the general body of the troops, including the firing parties-an effect which the critics of the existing system regard as bad, but sometimes consider to be of minor importance becomes the heart of the matter. The officers, non-commissioned officers and men with whom we discussed the question agreed that the effect was good, especially because. it enforced on the troops the lesson that complete self-sacrifice is demanded by military duty in war.Recommendations as to the Death Penalty on Active Service.14. In view of the above considerations, we cannot recommend that the death penalty should be abandoned as the extreme penalty for the most serious military offences on active service. Further, we cannot advise any very extensive reduction in the list of those offences. After very full consideration we feel bound to say that almost all of them when committed on active service, and proved against the accused under the conditions and
reservations defined in: the Act, may in the public interest require to be visited: with death. We think therefore that generally speaking the relevant sections of the Act should be left as they stand. We recommend, however, that the various offences defined at (e) (f) and 0) of Section 6 (1)* should be transferred to Section 6 (2), which includes offences for which the maximum penalty is cashiering or imprisonment only.15. We have given special consideration to the question of the retention of the death penalty for the offence of sleeping on post when acting as sentinel (Section 6 (1) (k) (i)). The cases fall into two classes ; sleeping may be due to deliberate dereliction of duty, or may be the unconscious and inevitable result of exhaustion. The latter class of cases should naturally be treated with the greatest leniency possible. The fact that only two men were shot for the offence of sleeping on post during the whole course of the Great War shows, however, that the death penalty is awarded  or this offence only very rarely, and only carried out when the Commander-in-Chief thinks it indispensable in the interests of the whole force. The failure of a sentry to watch is a matter which may imperil not only the lives of his comrades but the success of the whole operations of the Army. We therefore think it necessary to retain this punishment in reserve. We see no reason to suppose that the same discretion and clemency in enforcing it will not be shown in the future as in the past.The Death Penalty in Peace. 16. The question of the retention of the death penalty for military offences in peace is on another footing, and we recommend that it should be abolished for all of them except mutiny. Mutiny necessarily involves collective or combined insubordination, or a conspiracy to that end. It may lead to a total subversion of discipline and is the most serious of military offences. We feel bound in these circumstances to recommend that no change be made in the relevant section (Section 7) of the Act.* The relevant part of Section 6 (1) reads as follows : &quot; Every person subject to military law who commits any of the following offences ; that is to say,ft &amp; ft * &amp;(e) Impedes the provost marshal or any assistant provost marshal or any officer or non-commissioned officer (jr other person legally exercising authority under or on behalf of the provost marshal, or, when called on, refuses to assist in the execution of his duty the provost marshal, assistant provost marshal, or any such officer, non commissioned officer, or other person ; or(/) Does violence to any person bringing provisions or supplies to the forces ; or commits any offence against the property or person of any inhabitant of or resident in the country in which he is serving ; or* ft * * * *(j) Irregularly detains or appropriates to his own corps, battalion or detachment any provisions or supplies proceeding to the forces, contrary to any orders issued in that respect ;* * * ft * *shall, on conviction by court-martial, if he commits any such offence on active service, be liable to suffer death, or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned ;   .   .   .   .
17. Certain offences of individual insubordination and violence which do not amount to mutiny, however much they may tend towards it, are at present liable to the death penalty, even in peace, under Sections 8 and 9. For these offences when committed in peace we recommend that penal servitude should in future be the maximum penalty.Appeal in Cases op Death Sentence to the Cottet of Criminal Appeal(Amendment No. 10).18. Little evidence was offered to us in support of this proposal, but the subject has been ventilated in debate in the House, the general argument being that a right of appeal to a higher court would secure review in a calmer atmosphere.19. The question was fully dealt with by the Darling Committee (paragraphs 95 and following), and their general conclusion was that the automatic review of all trials which is carried out both by the confirming authority on the general merits, and by the Judge Advocate-GeneraFs Department on the legal aspect of the case, coupled with the right of the soldier to petition against his convic-tion, places the soldier convicted by court-martial in a better position than the civilian convicted upon indictment in a civil court. The Committee drew attention to the extent to which the power of commutation had been exercised by the confirming authority (the Commander-in-Chief) in the Great War (see. paragraph 10 above) and added (paragraph 107) : &quot; We doubt very much whether any Court, necessarily not possessing the information which he possessed as to the discipline and moral of the Army, would have ventured to. exercise clemency to any such extent. The Commander-in-Chief, of course, commuted sentences in many cases where the Court of Criminal Appeal would have had no legal grounds for interfering, and must therefore have dismissed an appeal.&quot;20. After alluding to the importance of the deterrent effect of punishment, the Darling Committee proceeded (paragraph 110): &quot; In our opinion, a Commander-in-Chief, who is entrusted with the safety of his Army, must not be fettered in his decision as to a point which so vitally affects the discipline of that Army. The essence of military punishments is that they should be exemplary and speedy. This is recognized by the Preamble to the Mutiny Acts and Army Acts which have been passed annually by Parliament for centuries. An exemplary punishment speedily carried out may prevent a mutiny from spreading or save an Army from defeat.&quot;21, We have little to add to these observations except that they are supported by the service evidence which we have taken, and that we fully agree with them, and can recommend no amendment of the Act on this subject. The gravest offences are generally committed on active service outside the United Kingdom, and appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal would involve very great delay and would thus defeat the primary object of military punishments, viz., that they should operate speedily as an example and deterrent to others.   If witnesses had to be brought back before
the Court of Appeal great difficulty and further delay might be involved.22. The Darling Committee found that the existence of the right to petition against sentence was not sufficiently known in the Array. The King&apos;s Regulations have been amended to remedy this weakness (see paragraph 656 of the edition of 1923) and we have no further changes to recommend.Compulsory Church Parade(Amendment No. 11). 23, This is a matter on which men&apos;s personal views naturally vary, and different individual opinions have been expressed to us by all ranks. A committee constituted as we are is not in a position to deal with the question in its religious aspect, and we must disclaim, as the witnesses who appeared before us in general disclaimed, any such intention. But we were impressed by the testimony, given to us by several officers of wide experience, regarding the desirability of retaining the present practice in the best interests of the Service. The view was expressed by a number of witnesses that what men object to is the parade which precedes the service rather than the service itself. No doubt individuals naturally sometimes grumble over the trouble necessary to appear smart and well turned out on this parade, but we think that the effect of this requirement is over-estimated, at any rate so far as the great majority of well-conducted soldiers are concerned. Other points which should be remembered are that the existing arrangements provide normally for the issue of week-end leave passes to a high proportion of well-conducted men ; and that men are not - compelled to attend services of denominations other than their own. Such compulsion is prohibited by the King&apos;s Regulations, and we are satisfied that this prohibition is duly observed.24. Altogether, the general conclusion seems to be that attendance at Divine Service under the present arrangements, for men present with their units on Sunday, should be retained. A parade or roll-call of some sort would in any case be necessary, and after, full consideration we recommend no change in the existing system.Cashiering of Officers for Scandalous Conduct (Amendment No. 12).25. Cashiering is expulsion from the Army with enduring profes-sional and social ignominy, and &quot; scandalous conduct&quot; is intended to cover only cases in which the conduct has been so scandalous that cashiering would be the only appropriate punishment. Accordingly under Section 16 cashiering is the only penalty admissible for the offence, the theory which is of very old standing being that no lesser punishment can be adequate. The amendment would enable the lesser punishment of dismissal to be awarded in cases of minor gravity.26. So far as the discretion of the court-martial is concerned, we think the existing law is sound, and indeed, in the interest of
offenders. If a lesser punishment were admissible, the tendency might be. to convict of the disgraceful offence of &quot;scandalous conduct &quot; for less serious offences.27. In the circumstances we do not recommend any amendment of Section 16, but inconvenience sometimes arises from the fact that in the case of this offence the confirming and reviewing authorities have no power to commute the sentence of cashiering by the substitution of any lesser penalty. This is because under Section 57 of the Act, commutation, except in the case of murder, is limited to such punishment as might have been awarded by the court. We think therefore that Section 57 should be amended to exempt the confirming and reviewing authorities from this disability in cases of cashiering for scandalous conduct.Disgraceful Conduct(Amendment No. 13).28. Section 16, as above indicated, lays down cashiering as the penalty for scandalous conduct on the part of an officer, whilst Section 18 provides imprisonment (or any less punishment) as the penalty for several specified forms of disgraceful conduct on the part of a soldier. The original intention appears to have been to prescribe parallel and appropriate punishments for equivalent offences in different ranks. The amendment would extend the provisions of Section 18 so as to cover officers as well as soldiers.29. We believe that in many cases cashiering is a punishment at least as severe in its practical effects as imprisonment, if not more severe. In law, however, it is, under the scale of punishments given in Section 44, a less punishment, and therefore in order to remove any suggestion of differentiation between classes we recommend the adoption in substance of this proposal.Exemption from Duty in Aid of the Civil Power in Trade Disputes(Amendment No. 14).30. Soldiers, in their capacity as citizens, and like all other citizens, are liable under the Common Law to be called upon by the civil power to stop or prevent disturbance of the peace. This Common Law liability necessarily remains in force when the disturbance or risk of disturbance arises out of a trade dispute or strike, since the illegality of disorder, and the consequent duty of preventing it which the Common Law imposes on all citizens, lies in the fact of the disorder itself and is not dependent on the original merits of the dispute. Otherwise the troops have no concern whatever with trade disputes and strikes as such, and we would here add that duty in aid of the civil power in such cases is a task imposed upon the troops with the utmost reluctance, and undertaken by them with equal reluctance.31. The amendment would enable individual soldiers to contract out of part of their liability to aid the civil power.
32. Experience shows that strikes may be attended by sporadic disorder, and we do not see how any Government, having regard to its duty of enforcing the law, could so far divest itself of the legal powers which it now possesses for carrying out that duty. Further the effect of the amendment would be disastrous to discipline, since it would enable individual soldiers, serving in barracks and under military law, to exempt themselves from the necessity of obeying orders and so assisting their comrades in discharging a disagreeable task.   We cannot recommend the adoption of this amendment.33. In connection with this subject we desire to dispel an opinion apparently current outside (though not within) the Army, that an officer is allowed to exercise a discretion denied to his men, in the matter of obeying lawful orders which are not in accordance with his individual conscience. This supposed doctrine derives no countenance from the Army Act or King&apos;s Regulations, and is expressly discountenanced by the Manual of Military Law (Chapter III, paragraph 12, of the edition of 1914), but one alleged instance is frequently quoted, viz., the so-called &quot; Curragh incident&quot; of March, 1914, in which the question of how certain officers would act in certain contingencies was undoubtedly discussed between them and their military superior at the Curragh Camp.34. It is beyond the province of a departmental committee such as we are to discuss the merits of this case, which formed the subject of acute political controversy at the time. But whether or. not the officers concerned were offered, or supposed; themselves to be offered, some option regarding their future action, it is clear that such a proceeding was repudiated as a precedent for the future both by the Army Council and by His Majesty&apos;s Government. This was made plain by a special Army Order published in consequence of the incident on 27th March, 1914, and never since cancelled. This Army Order, which is reprinted in extenso in Appendix III, lays down for all ranks equally the absolute duty of obedience to &quot; all lawful commands &quot; in matters concerning &quot;the support of the civil power in the ordinary execution of its duty.&quot;Proposal to raise the Age Limit of Enlistment to 21 Years(Amendment Nos. 15 and 16).35.. Recruiting in a voluntary army necessarily competes with the general labour market, but the present normal ages of entering and leaving the Army are such as to reduce this competition to a minimum. The men are young enough not to have been absorbed in the labour market before enlistment, and to be still capable of absorption therein on discharge. Adoption of the present amend-ments would militate in both respects against the interests of the public and of the individual soldier, and we respectfully concur in the Secretary of State&apos;s (Mr. Walsh&apos;sl opinion, expressed in the House (Official Report of 2nd April, 1924, column 288), that no government could accept such a proposal.
of State to His Majesty thereon. There is no restriction as to the subject matter of the complaint, and there is quite rightly no power to penalise the officer for making the complaint. The effect of the amendments would be to introduce between the complainant and the Army Council an &apos;-independent tribunal,&quot; and, from the use1 of the word &quot; tribunal&quot; and the statutory position which the contemplated body would possess, we presume that.it is intended to be a species of judicial authority by whose award the Army Council would be more or less bound.43. No evidence on these two amendments has been offered to us, but the subject has on several occasions been ventilated in debate, and we gather that what mainly underlies the amendments is the belief that officers are liable to have their careers prejudiced by unfair confidential reports and similar means, and that their protests are really examined only by- the subordinate authorities who have made these reports, and not effectively by higher authority. We are in a position to state from intimate personal knowledge of the manner in which complaints are dealt with in the departments, that this is a quite inaccurate representation of what actually happens. No commanding officer could by himself destroy a subordinated reputation by an adverse report; due steps are taken to compare such individual opinions with those of other officers, and when the case comes before higher authority, care, discretion, and we think we may add, goodwill, are exercised. Further, under paragraph 224 of the King&apos;s Regulations, any officer called upon to resign or retire for reasons other than misconduct may claim, and he frequently does claim, an interview with a member of the Army Council.44. In all the circumstances, we do not think that the establish-ment of the proposed tribunal is necessary or desirable. In enquiring into the efficiency of any officer, such a tribunal would be dealing not with matters of fact but with matters of opinion. Such matters can, we think, only be dealt with, precisely as they would be in civil life, by the officers superiors, who are responsible for the results, of his work and for the effect which his further employment or pro-motion would have on the efficiency of the Service.Imprisonment of Military Offenders (Amendment No. 22).45. The object of this amendment is to give a court-martial power to place an offender either in the first, or second division of a civil prison, according to his character and antecedents. We believe, however, that the prison authorities already have power to place prisoners in various categories according to the merits of the case, and we think that this power is sufficient. We do not recommend, therefore, that the amendment should be proceeded with.
SUMMARY46. We may summarise our recommendations as follows :  (1) The death penalty on active service to be abolished for the offences indicated in paragraph 14, but otherwise to be retained as the extreme penalty for the military offences for which it is admissible at present (paragraphs 3-15). (2) The death penalty to be abolished in peace for all militaryoffences except that of mutiny (paragraphs 16 and 17). (3) No change is recommended in the existing arrangements for review of and petition against death sentences, and there need, therefore, be no right of appeal in these cases to the Court of Criminal Appeal (para-graphs 18-22).(4) No change to be made in the present arrangements as to compulsory Church Parade (paragraphs 23 and 24),(5) In order to secure greater freedom in dealing with cases of conviction on a charge of scandalous conduct, Section 57 to be so amended as to give power to the confirming and reviewing authorities to commute for a lesser punishment the sentence of cashiering, which is at present the only possible sentence (paragraphs 25-27).(6) Section 18, which deals with various forms of disgraceful conduct, to be amended so as to be generally applicable to officers as well as to soldiers (paragraphs 28 and 29).(7) The remaining amendments not to be proceeded with (paragraphs 30-45).47. Our recommendations apply equally to both Acts, Army and Air Force.48. We wish to place on record our great appreciation of the services rendered by our Secretary, Mr. B. M. Draper.H.

APPENDIX III.Special Army Order issued on 27th March, 1914,&apos;as the result of the &quot;Curragh incident&quot; (see paragraphs 30-34 of Report).Discipline.1. No officer or soldier should in future be questioned by his superior officer as to the attitude he will adopt or as to his action in the event of his being required to obey orders dependent on future or hypothetical contingencies.2. An officer or soldier is forbidden in future to ask for assurances as to orders which he may be required to obey.3. In particular, it is the duty of every officer and soldier to obey all lawful commands given to them through the proper channel either for the safe-guarding of public property, or the support of the civil power in the ordinary execution of its duty, or for the protection of the lives and property of the inhabitants in the case of disturbance of the peace.
Army and Air Force (Annual)Bill.NOTES ON CLAUSES.Clause 4.The effect of these amendments is to abolish the death sentence for offences described in section 6 (1) (e) (/) and (j), and to restrict its award under sections 8(1) and 9 (1) to cases where those offences are committed on active service.Clause 5.This clause extends section 18 so as to render officers liable to conviction for the offences enumerated in that section, which in its present form applies Only to offences by soldiers.Clause 6.Paragraph (i) This paragraph corrects an error, the effect of which would appear to be that a soldier summarily convicted of drunkenness cannot be fined in addition to any other punishment unless that punishment is detention.Paragraph (ii)-This amendment makes it clear that minor punishments are summary punishments. It does not alter a commanding officer&apos;s existing powers.Paragraph (hi) This amendment makes it clear that a man is not to be court martialled on a charge which has been dismissed by his commanding officer.Paragraph (iv) This amendment makes clear the meaning of &quot;pay&quot; and brings the section into line with section 138 of the Act.Paragraph (v) Minor punishments have in the past been inflicted by subordinate officers subject to the provisions of the King&apos;s Regulations. In view of the fact that it is now proposed to insert: in the Army Act an express provision that a commanding officer may award minor punishments and to repeal section 46 (9), it is desired that the power of awarding minor punish-93-3 A
merits hitherto exercised by subordinate officers should be preserved, and the amendment effected by this paragraph places the matter beyond doubt.Clause 7.Paragraph 1. The object of this amendment is to give the officer commanding overseas the same powers of dealing summarily with officers and warrant officers as are now possessed by the commander-in-chief in the case of active service.Paragraph 2. This is a drafting amendment, which makes it clear that where a charge dealt with summarily has been dismissed, the accused is not liable to be tried by court martial.Clause 8.By section 57 a confirming authority when confkming a sentence and a superior military authority after con-firmation have power to commute a sentence for any less punishment which might have been awarded by the court martial. By section 16 of the Army Act a court martial has no discretion as to the punishment which may be awarded for an offence under that section. The result is that there is no power to commute a sentence of cashiering awarded under section 16, and this amend-ment will remedy the defect.Clause 9.The object of this amendment is to make it clear that a combatant officer may be given command, so far as relates to military operations, over a non-combatant officer of higher rank.Clause 10.The powers of impressing carriages for the purposes of a route conferred by sections 112 and 113 of, and the Thud Schedule to, the Army and Air Force Acts (1) do not apply to mechanically propelled transport;(2) provide for rates of payment in terms which are not applicable to modern means of transport.This clause and the schedule referred to in it are intended to remedy these defects and to provide a means of settling the payments to be made in default of agree-
merit by reference to a county court judge, in the same manner as is already provided for in the case of impress-ment under section 115 which provides for impressment of vehicles in times of emergency.The schedule also makes certain minor alterations in the provisions as to impressment of carriages in order to meet difficulties which have arisen.Clause 11.At present, a deduction from the pay of an officer can be made to make good losses to public property occasioned by his negligence. The effect of this amend-ment will be to extend the power where the property damaged is regimental but not public property.,Clause 12.The object of this amendment is to make it clear that a deduction can be made from a soldier&apos;s pay for every day during which he is serving a sentence of penal servitude in like manner as when he is serving a sentence of imprisonment.Clause 13.The effect of this clause is that where a person subject to military law has been arrested or has surrender-dered and has been taken to a police station in His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, a certificate purporting to be signed by the police officer in charge of the station may be used in subsequent proceedings as evidence of the fact, date and place of the arrest or surrender.Clause 14.Owing to various amendments which have been made in the Army Act, some of the cross headings have become misleading. This clause proposes to take power to enable the Clerk of the Parliaments to make the necessary &quot;alterations in future editions of the army act.Clause 16.These amendments are necessary owing to the fact that the corps of Army schoolmasters has been disbanded and its place taken by the Army Educational Corps.93 A 2
Clause 17.The amendments contained in this clause are designed to simplify the definition of the expression &quot; corps &quot; for the purposes of the &quot;Army Act, and to make consequential amendments in the enactments relating to the reserve forces and the territorial army, so that there may be a uniform procedure viz.; Royal &apos; Warrant for estab-lishing corps in all cases.Clause 18.At present forfeiture of pay can be imposed as a punishment in the case of an airman on active service. This clause proposes to extend this provision to the case of an airman not on active service, but reducing the amount which may be ordered to be forfeited from three months&apos; pay to twenty-eight days&apos; pay.Clause 19.The object of this amendment is to authorise the prolongation of service of men whose time of discharge or transfer to the reserve occurs when invasion is appre-apprehended, though war has not actually been declared.Clause 20.The object of this amendment is to enable the air force to be billeted with men of the auxiliary air force when they have been called out in defence of the British Islands before the territorial army has been embodied.Clause 21.This amendment will have the effect of making officers of the Air Force Reserve subject to the Act at all times, thus placing them on the same footing in this respect as officers of the Militia, Territorial Army, Royal Air Force Special Reserve, and Auxiliary Air Force.
