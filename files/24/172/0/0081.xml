Appendix ...P ge 1415 24 27 81 36IN the present memorandum an attempt is made to appreciate the existing financial and economic situation of the Soviet Union. The moment is opportune for doing so, because the Soviet economic system seems at last to be acquiring stability, and the purpose and effect of Soviet economic policy are becoming clearer.. The form and content of the memorandum may call for explanation. The account which it gives of the Soviet economy is neither systematic nor exhaustive. The reason for this is that the facts in themselves are often in apparent contradiction, and the conditions ruling in the Soviet Union are so strange that the meaning of even such facts as seem to tell a plain story is not to be accepted without careful examination. What is required is therefore not a catalogue but a commentary. It is of less importance to describe the existing situation in detail than to enquire generally what the Bolsheviks are trying to do and how far they are succeeding in doing it. And as the economic purpose of the Soviet Republic and the conditions in which that purpose is being worked out are alien to the experience of western capitalist societies, it has seemed necessary to the writer to return to the first principles upon which the Soviet revolution was founded, to follow their application to the more serious of the problems that have faced the Soviet Government since its establishment, and to seek in them a standard by which the facts of Soviet economic history are to be judged. It also seems desirable to suggest reasons why, in the face of the common opinion that the Soviet economic system has since its inception trembled on the brink of the abyss, that system continues to exist at all. It is not pretended that a complete explanation has been found; and if the attempt to find one has involved excursions into the realm of speculation, the indulgence of the reader will, it is hoped, not be withheld. In order, however, to compensate for the discursive character of the memorandum itself, a selection of the more significant statistics has been added as an appendix.It should be added that the memorandum was written before the official report of the British Trade Union Delegation to Russia was published, though not, of course, before its general conclusions were known.I. The Soviet Economic System. The Theory of the Proletarian State.1. The theory of Marx on the development of human society, as expounded by Lenin * is in the briefest outline as follows :-The State, as we know it, is not the embodiment of a moral idea nor even the representative of the whole of society; it is the product and manifestation of* &quot;The State and Revolution,&quot; September 19;7.2711   [12760] b
the irreconcilability of class antagonism in the bosom of society, and is, in fact, the instrument of oppression of one class by another. In the world as at present constituted, the oppressing class is the minority, the economic exploiters, the capitalists; the oppressed class is the majority, the economically exploited, the proletarians. The present system offers no prospect of real progress. The capitalists cannot exist except by the toil of the proletarians, and cannot prosper except at the expense of the proletarians. The proletarians, on the other hand, can well exist without the capitalists; they possess all the elements necessary for the achievement in due time of that perfect society in which there is no class and therefore no State, as at present understood, and in which the two fundamental Communist ideas are realised : &apos;&apos; He that will not work, neither shall he eat&apos;&apos;; &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.&quot;As capitalism grew out of feudalism, so will Communism grow out of a capitalism run to seed. The more highly organised the society and the higher the standard of education of the industrial proletariat, the easier the transition from capitalism to Communism, for the proletarians will find their weapons ready made. Capitalism, as its enterprises become more huge and complex, prepares the ground for the participation of every individual in the administration of the State.The first duty of proletarians is to become conscious of their class; the next to gather strength by uniting; and the third, when they feel themselves sufficiently strong, to seize power by armed force and utterly destroy the bureaucratic and military machine of the capitalist State. In this manner alone, and by no evolutionary process, can exploitation of man by man be suppressed and a path towards the Communist society cleared.In the place of the capitalist State, now in ruins, the proletarians must introduce not a Communist community for this is the work of time but an oppressive organ of their own class, a proletarian State, a dictatorship of the proletariat, the purpose of which is to stamp out what yet remains of capitalism and its mentality, and to prepare the minds and habits of the whole population for the Communist society which is the next, the final, but maybe distant, objective in the advance to the non-State.In this perfect society all the functions of government are discharged or dischargeable by every individual of the community in his turn. Most of the functions of government in highly-organised States are relatively simple and need not be discharged by a privileged and highly-paid official class; they can in time be performed by even wider sections of the masses and will become a habit and finally die out as special functions. The population will learn little by little to work for society without regulation by law and in this way the proletarian State will gradually &quot;wither away&quot; and the non-State, the Communist society, will come into being.It is impossible to foresee how long will be the period of transition or what stages will be traversed; but one probable stage is a lower or Socialist form of Communism in which the proletarian Government, having expropriated the exploiters, possesses the entire means of production; recruits its officials from the former bureaucracy, but at workers&apos; wages; decrees that all must work in order to live; and allots to each, in recompense, a quantity of products from, the common store commensurate, not indeed with his needs, but with the usefulness of his labour for social purposes.The bridge between this transitional stage and the final stage is the &apos;&apos; gigantic development of the productive forces of human society&apos;&apos; which will surely result from the destruction of the chaotic and wasteful capitalist system. Men will acquire the automatic social habit and will voluntarily work &quot; according to their abilities &quot; so productively that there will be no need for the rationing of products by the proletarian State, and each will take freely &quot; according to his need.&quot;It cannot be promised that this Utopia will ever be actually achieved; but the only possible path towards it lies through the proletarian State; and, until it does arrive, the dictatorship of the armed workers must be retained with the strictest control by society and the State over the means of production, the quantity of labour and the quantity of consumption. There must be a &quot; factory discipline &quot; for the whole population.2. It is necessary to dwell for a moment on the significant admission that the achievement of the Communist Utopia cannot be guaranteed, for it supplies the key to
much that follows. It implies that &quot;factory discipline,&quot; which is the mark of the transitional government of the &quot;workers organised as the ruling classes,&quot; is justifiable and admirable, not merely as the necessary process by which alone a great ideal can be achieved, but also in itself and for its own ends, even though the ultimate goal be in fact unattainable. The oppressiveness of the regime for the working classes, as compared with the more advanced capitalist societies, is not denied; its possible, even probable, economic inefficiency not concealed. These things do not matter. Once it has come into existence, a proletarian State is to be perpetuated for its own sake at no matter how heavy a cost to the population, including the working classes, even though it may be manifestly failing of its ultimate purpose. And it is to be preferred to the most prosperous democratic society organised on capitalist principles, however high the political and social status of the working classes within the capitalist frame. People must be taught to live for society alone and not for themselves.The Theory, and Practice of the November Revolution.3. What the Bolsheviks sought to establish in November 1917 was a transitional proletarian State as described by Marx. The State that has actually come into existence is a very different thing, as will now be explained; but although the Bolsheviks have had to abandon much of the Marxist plan, they have held firmly to this principle, that the individual is nothing, and that the community is all.4. The work of Lenin upon which the foregoing summary is based was written in August and September 1917, on the eve of the Bolshevik revolution. When, a few months later, Lenin thought that the kingdom of Marx was at hand and that the moment was ripe to precipitate a proletarian revolution in Russia, which was to be the first of a series of world proletarian revolutions, his project was condemned as rash and premature by the purer Marxists, amongst them Zinoviev and Kamenev, later to be his whole-hearted collaborators. They believed with Marx that the proletarian revolution would first appear in one of the industrial countries of the West, and that Russia was not ripe for it; Lenin, on the contrary, held that in the welter of an imperialist war a proletarian revolution in Russia, however incomplete, would fire the train. It was to be not simply a domestic revolution, but the herald of world revolution. Events have proved that Lenin miscalculated. The Bolshevik revolution of November 1917 did not provoke a world revolution, and as it failed of this, its true purpose, it must be held to have been premature. As a domestic revolution, too, it was in the nature of things premature from the Marxist point of view, as the conditions in which it was precipitated, except in so far as they were generally conducive to upheaval, fitted very ill into&apos; Marx&apos;s scheme. Instead of an industrial society highly organised, intelligent and politically mature, there was a huge and primitive peasant community, largely illiterate, together with a small industrial proletariat, unaccustomed to corporate action and unskilled in practical politics. Everything was against the execution of much more of the Marxian programme than the mere seizure of power by the armed workers. On the other hand, once the transfer of authority had taken place, the backwardness of the population, which had stood in the way of full revolutionary achievement, made it easier for the new rulers to consolidate their position and to ensure that, however their policy might change, their authority should not be seriously challenged.5. There were, nevertheless, some among the Bolsheviks who thought that although the revolution may have been premature, the rules of Marx ought still to be strictly observed. Lenin was not one of these. He insisted that Marx had based his theory on a study of events and tendencies; that he had modified it after the experience of the revolutions of 1848 and again after the Commune of 1871; that he would have had lessons to learn from the Russian revolutions of 1905 and March 1917; and that therefore he himself, as leader of the latest proletarian revolution, had a right to be guided by realities. He recognised that it would be wise to be content with something short of even the transitional proletarian State, as defined by Marx, and to consolidate what was won rather than to hasten on towards the unattainable. It is curious to notice that already in August 1917, before the establishment of the Soviet Government, he had foreseen the possibility of a mixed kind of State after the revolution. &quot; Por a certain time,&quot; he says, &quot; not only bourgeois law, but even the capitalist State may remain under Communism without the capitalist class .... It is not Marx&apos;s own sweet will which smuggled a scrap of bourgeois law into Communism, he simply indicated what is economically and politically inevitable in a society issuing from the womb of capitalism.&quot;   He was
overruled by those to whom every word of Marx was law, and an attempt was made to establish at one stride &quot; the first or lower or Socialist phase of Communism,&quot; that is to say, the transitional proletarian State as described above. The attempt failed. Lenin&apos;s policy of compromise was at last adopted, and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic took up a station on the Marxian road very far short even of the first or lower stage of Communism. &quot; The style &apos; Socialist Soviet Republic,&apos; &quot; said Lenin, &quot; expresses only the determination of the Soviet Republic to forward the passage to Socialism. It in no way constitutes a claim that the new economic order in Russia is a Socialist one.&quot;The Economics of the November Revolution: The Single Economic Plan.6. In order to explain the character of the new economic order which has come into being in Soviet Russia, it will be necessary to touch briefly upon the economic aspect of the unsuccessful attempt which was made to establish a transitional proletarian State on the strict Marxist plan, as well as upon the economic policy advocated by Lenin and eventually adopted when the earlier system was seen to have broken down beyond repair.7. The economic system which it was the object of the Bolsheviks to put into operation after the November revolution is commonly known as the &quot; single economic plan.&quot; The objects of this plan were, in principle, two. The first was to bring into existence a system by which all production, distribution and consumption of wealth should be directly planned, organised and controlled by the State. The second was to dispense with the idea of price or of production with an eye to the market. A factory would produce articles, not because they could be produced and sold at a profit, but because the State production plan laid down that the output of that particular factory should take that particular form. A factory would, in the same way, receive raw materials according to plan and not because it had money with which to pay for them. A worker would receive wages, not as earnings, but as his share of goods under the State plan of distribution, and he would be paid, not in cash, but in coupons. In other words, there was to be a universal rationing system into which the conception of money did not enter, accompanied by &quot; factory discipline&quot; for the whole population.8. From November 1917 to March 1921 an attempt was made to put this plan into operation. Needless to say, it was unsuccessful. In order to supplement an ineffective rationing system illicit markets sprang up, and the idea of price persisted, as it were, underground. But what actually dealt the death-blow was the threat of starvation. According to the legislation of 1918-20, the peasants were only allowed enough grain to feed themselves and their families and to provide for the next year&apos;s sowings. The remainder of their grain wa,s to be surrendered to the State for the victualling of the urban population, and in case of necessity the State might, and in fact usually did, seize its quota by forcible requisition. The peasants began to restrict production to their own personal requirements, and it became impossible to extract from them sufficient food for the Red army and the industrial proletariat. It was this situation that by 1921 made the adoption of Lenin&apos;s policy imperative.The New Economic Policy and its Consequences.9. The bearing of the New Economic Policy upon the development of agriculture and industry will be discussed in some detail in the following chapter, but something must be said here of its effect upon the general character of the Soviet economic system. Its importance in this respect cannot be exaggerated, for it saved the Soviet economic system from total collapse by setting it to work again, and it revolutionised it by reintroducing the idea of price. The peasant was now permitted to dispose at his own free will of such surplus grain as might remain on his hands after the payment to the State of a tax in kind, and his surplus was no longer requisitioned but sold by himself in the market, The better situated and better equipped factories were grouped together and placed under the management of State trusts, which were expected to conduct them on business lines; others were handed over to co-operative societies or private enterprise. Both innovations brought with them the re-establish-ment of a market and the resumption of. money payments. The middleman appeared and became the type of the new economic policy, the &quot;nepman,&quot; abhorrent to the Communist mind but tolerated because indispensable. It had been thought that the national resources could be apportioned without recourse to money; and State services, education, transport, postal and telegraphic services, and medical attention had been provided free.  With the introduction of the new economic policy, hoAvever,
payment for railway, postal and telegraphic services, for municipal services and for food rations returned. Decrees were issued abolishing all limitation upon the possession and handling of money. State factories were allowed to buy and sell in the open market. Taxation was introduced, a State Bank was established, and as early as the end of 1921 the All-Russia Congress of Soviets recommended the stabilisation of the currency. So momentous was the change wrought by Lenin&apos;s new policy that to-day, largely as a consequence of it, the party whose purest aspiration is the &quot; withering away &quot; of the State, governs through the medium of a complex State machinery, planned and co-ordinated by a special State Planning Commission on the latest scientific principles; and the party, whose boast it is to be the first Communist party of the world and the leader of the Communist Inter-national, is using its most anxious endeavours to acquire these hall-marks of capitalism, a stable currency and a balanced budget.The Soviet Republic under the New Economic Policy.10. The Soviet Government is, therefore, a workers&apos; Government, conscious of its duty of establishing, if possible, perhaps in the distant future, the ideal Communist society defined by Marx, and by the process laid down by him. It has been compelled to adopt some capitalist forms and tolerate some capitalist relations, possibly because the realisation of the perfect Communist society is in the nature of things impossible, whether by the methods of Marx or by any other; or, possibly, because, finding itself isolated in a hostile capitalist environment, with no immediate hope of bringing the world to follow its example, it recognises that, in order to preserve its existence, both for its own sake and as a repository of the Communist idea against better days (should they come), it must in some measure conform to its environment. But it is a Government determined that, whatever alien forms it may have to adopt, it will remain at all costs and above all things a workers&apos; Govern-ment, and that exploitation of man by man shall be rigidly controlled if not entirely suppressed. &apos;11. The Soviet Republic is a society partly capitalist, partly Socialist, partly Communist. It is capitalist because the idea of price is universal, because its members, and indeed the State itself, produce with an eye to the market, and because a part at least of the means of production and distribution remain in private hands and are exploited for private profit. The whole agricultural industry, the bulk of the internal retail trade and a, fair proportion of the wholesale trade are conducted by private enterprise. The peasant, who forms 80 per cent, of the population and furnishes three-quarters of the national output and nearly two-thirds of the revenue, is, with the private trader and the small urban employer, the powerful capitalist element in this ostensibly Socialist State. It is none the less, a predominantly Socialist State. The whole national economy is subordinated in intention at least-to a unified State plan, drafted by a special department of the Government and imposed upon the community so far as this is possible- by the exercise of &quot; factory discipline.&quot; -The State retains under its own direct control, or delegates to State or semi-State organisations, the whole of the foreign trade, banking, insurance and transport, the whole of the heavy* and part of the light industry, part of the wholesale and retail internal trade, and, in particular, the bulk of the grain purchase. The fact that the State is itself a capitalist does not in any way destroy its Socialist character. As for the Communist element, this is not so much fact as aspiration; an idea not yet fully embodied, but continually seeking embodiment and informing the whole system. It uses Socialist forms as an instrument because this is the Marxian plan; it tolerates capitalist relations because Lenin said that Marx would have tolerated them if he had known; it disciplines the Communist party and restricts its numbers to the trustworthy and faithful, and defends their privileges; it watches the interests of the working class (by which is meant the urban proletariat) and promotes class, consciousness; it has its eyes in every institution and office and factory; it organises a State Political Department to destroy the enemies of the Workers&apos; Republic and of the Communist idea; it takes in hand the education of the young and teaches them the undiluted Marxist faith; it sends its purest souls to the Communist International to preach the gospel to every creature; and it combats the bourgeois mentality in whatever form it may be supposed to exist religion, illusions about the inalienable rights of man, belief in the efficacy of representative institutions or in the sanctity of private property; in a word, it conducts the propaganda of the faith.   But it has planted itself in a* In Soviet parlance &quot;heavy &quot;industry includes the mining, metallurgical, lieavy engineering- and heavy chemical industries.
society where the mass of the people is immune from its virus, yet does not possess the energy to destroy it. That is at once the tragedy (or, if you will, the comedy) of the Russian Revolution and the reason for its survival.The Soviet Republic compared with Western Societies: The Revolutionary and Russian Coefficients.12. Such a society is clearly alien to the societies of the West, but it is desirable to enquire more closely into the nature of the difference. The matter may perhaps be expressed by saying that, in interpreting facts and situations in regard to the Soviet Republic, it is necessary to apply two coefficients, a Russian and a revolutionary.13. The revolutionary coefficient has two factors, one economic, the other political. Economically regarded, the bourgeois State is, in Communist ideas, a sterile, parasitic organisation, standing above and battening upon the production of workers and peasants. In a purely Communist society on the contrary the State loses its identity as such, and the community is organised on a productive basis as one indivisible body whose members work for the benefit of the whole. In the intermediate proletarian society the State is partly parasitic and partly productive. On the one hand, it stands above production and distribution; on the other, it actively participates in them; and as it develops towards its ultimate aim it should tend gradually to lose its parasitic character and to melt into the community. The Soviet Government has this dual nature, but, far from tending to merge into the body of society, it appears to be retaining and fixing its own identity. It still, nevertheless, retains the essential character of a proletarian State, which is that it stands for the realisation of definite economic and material aims. Herein lies the principal distinction between the Soviet Government and the bourgeois Governments of the West. Western Govermnents regard it as their function to preserve the existing economic system, to allow it to develop of its own motion under adjustment, or at most to transform it slowly. The Soviet Government, on the contrary, has a militant mission, which is to create a new kind of economic system and to dragoon the population into compliance with the rules upon which the system is based, recognising no inherent right to the individual to live his own economic life. It is persuaded that it alone is the organiser of prosperity, and its problem is how to secure the immediate aim, which is prosperity, without sacrificing the ultimate aim the perfect Communist society.14. Politically, the complex organisation usually called the Soviet Government is legislature and executive in one, served by a dependent judiciary, whose function it is to administer and interpret the codes not solely in the light of statute law, but under the guidance of the revolutionary conscience. Not only so, but the Govern-ment itself, which is in reality the Communist party organised as an instrument of government, is under the effective if extra-constitutional direction of the Political Bureau, the small inner council of the party whose word is law. The ruling authority in the Soviet Union is therefore a free agent, unhampered by any rule of law or by public opinion or by the vested interests inherent in any system based upon private property. It has opportunities of experiment denied to other Governments, and therefore its measures must not be regarded as being necessarily in defiance of economic law, as generally accepted, for no other reason than that in complex and delicate Western societies they would be inapplicable or defeat their own ends. The standard of the possible is not the same.15. It is perhaps unnecessary to insist on the importance of the Russian coefficient. The value of that coefficient is determined both by the nature of the country and the character and habits of the people, if indeed the two things are separable. It has already been observed that Russia was not a favourable field for a fully developed Communist experiment, but that, on the other hand, it offered very favourable conditions for the survival of a revolutionary State. In a Western industrial society the fate of a proletarian revolution would, in all probability, be very quickly decided; it would either succeed and develop its success, or it would fail and disappear. In Russia it has neither succeeded nor failed it survives. Russia is difficult to conquer and need never starve unless, as periodically happens, there is widespread crop failure over vast regions of the country. Armed intervention or boycott from abroad are therefore not likely to be effective means of pressure upon a new regime, and so it has proved. Moreover, external difficulties apart, the advantages are with the usurping revolutionary power. The distress inseparable from political upheaval is less catastrophic where there is no delicate organism to
II. The Primary Economic Problem : the Relation between Agriculture andIndustry.16. Russia is a predominantly agricultural and pastoral country, which, before the war, supported a population of about 180 millions. The standard of living was, compared with Western Europe, a low one, and this was an important factor in enabling Russia to take her place, second only to North Amerca, as a grain-exporting region. There was also a small but rapidly-growing industry requiring and obtaining abundant foreign capital for its development, but supplying only a part of the home demand for nianufactured goods. The effects of war, famine, revolution and civil strife, and the loss of what was once Russian territory reduced the population to 130 millions, diminished the productivity of agriculture, lowered the standard of living, and for some years completely stopped the export of grain. The industrial machine was dislocated and, cut off from foreign capital, was thrown back on its own feeble resources.17. In a self supporting society like Russia the economic relation between town and country is direct and vital. In the earlier years of the Soviet regime the commerce between urban and rural workers which is the basis of this relationship broke down under the strain of the &quot; single economic plan.&quot; The Soviet Government was in nominal control at least of both sides of this commerce; the land was nationalised, industry was nationalised, and yet the problem of the exchange of their respective products remained. If any semblance of economic life was to be main-tained it was essential to promote an active interchange of products between the peasants, the principal producers of wealth, on the one hand, and the urban workers, the preservers of the revolution, on the other. In introducing the New Economic Policy, the Soviet Government took a first step towards the solution of this, its primary economic problem, and it is now necessary to show what further steps were necessary and how far they succeeded. But something must first be said on the general development of agriculture and industry respectively after the Revolution.Soviet A agricultural Policy and its Results.18. It would have been in strict keeping with Communist ideas if, on their accession to power, the Bolsheviks had at once established a communal agricultural system and constituted the peasants, as it were, members of one vast household. Nothing of the kind was even attempted. What happened in fact was that the poorer peasants, that is to say the bulk of the agricultural population, largely consummated their own revolution by seizing for themselves the land that they had hitherto tilled in return for an obligation to pay rent or give service to a landlord. All that the Soviet Government did was to nationalise the land, while at the same time confirming the peasants in perpetual occupation of their holdings, in usufruct,destroy, and falls less bitterly upon a population which, in the mass, has no experience of a way of life much above the bare subsistence level, and little conception of any purpose in life except to obtain the bare means of supporting it. Both the urban worker and the peasant have on the average a lower standard of life now than even the meagre standard of pre-war days, and there seems no reason why they should not acquiesce in a still lower standard, if need be, provided that the Government can persuade them (as it well knows ho w) by propaganda or by the parade of authority that there is no alternative but to endure. The peasant is, perhaps, the less dissatisfied with his present lot, seeing that he holds his land on somewhat better conditions than before, but he has no gratitude to the Government, nor indeed any cause for gratitude. There have been poor harvests since the Bolsheviks came, he says, and therefore God is against the Bolsheviks; but he is content to leave vengeance to &quot;Whom it belongs. He lives by bread alone, and if bread falls short he dies and there an end. The urban worker is favoured by the Government, but he is less docile. And if food failed in the towns the regime might pass, not through a surrender to capitalist methods, which may well be its ultimate fate, but in violence. Service with armies in the field has shown this generation that the comfortable bourgeois and the man of sensibility and culture can cheerfully endure conditions of the most extreme misery and danger, to which there is no calculable term and which may very well only be ended with life itself. If these can so adapt themselves, it is not surprising that the Russian worker or peasant should dumbly acquiesce in conditions differing only in degree from those that he has always known, imposed by an authority that has the determination and skill to permit no hope of an alternative.
and subject to certain conditions as to transfer. Adjustments in detail gave limited effect to Communist theory; and about 30 per cent, of the area of the larger estates was retained by the State for exploitation on communal principles as model farms, which were to serve either as object lessons to the surrounding district or as experimental and research stations. In the result, the actual increase in the area of agricultural land in the occupation of the peasants was not great, and has been computed at about -4 of a desyatin (i.e., 1 acre) per head of the agricultural population.19. The most apparent social effect of the two revolutions of 1917, so far as agriculture is concerned, was an increase in the number and a decrease in the size of the peasant holdings, for while in 1913 more than half the holdings were over 17 acres, 80 per cent, of them are to-day under 10 acres. The Soviet Government have, however, set a limit to the subdivision of holdings by insisting that each holding shall be large enough to be self-supporting. It has also, under the Agrarian Code of October 1922, freed the cultivator from the restrictions as to methods of cultivation (rotation, date of ploughing, and what not), partly customary, partly communal, enforced under the old regime by the &quot; mir&quot; or village council. The Soviet authorities and their apologists claim that the path is now clearer than ever before for the adoption of more intelligent and more productive methods of cultivation, and it has in fact been alleged by scientific agriculturalists that if the adoption of early instead of late ploughing could gradually be introduced, it would ultimately increase the agricultural output by 20 per cent, without any increase -in the area under cultivation or in the capital engaged in the industry. If, then, the position of the peasants is worse under the Bolsheviks than under the Tsar, the cause does not lie in the conditions upon which they hold their land.20. Working under these conditions and thanks to the New Economic Policy, the cultivators have shown a steady increase both in the area of land under cultivation and in the total product of their labour. Between 1921 and 1924 the area under cultivation rose from 50 per cent, of the pre-war area to 75 per cent.* Production, which fell in 1920 to under a third of the pre-war figure, was in 1924 about two-thirds of that figure, and this notwithstanding that it was a poor harvest.! In qualifica-tion of this statement it must be added that the proportion of the richer cereals (wheat and barley) to the poorer cereals (oats and rye) is smaller than before the war, but even here matters are slowly readjusting themselves. The &quot; ocean of rye &quot; which overflowed the wheat, barley and cotton lands in the days of grain requisition and famine has not yet retired to its normal limits.21. The Government depends wholly on the peasant for the victualling, of the country, and to a large extent also for the provision of revenue. The following are the measures that were successively adopted for the collection of the peasants&apos; surplus, whether in cash or in kind. The first plan, as already shown, was requisition pure and simple, the quantity of grain assigned for the peasants&apos; own consumption being fixed at a figure which was below even the very low pre-war average consumption, and the surplus being collected by a &quot; food army &quot; of 20,000 men. This plan failed : the peasants restricted their sowings, and the surplus fell away to nothing. In 1921, under the New Economic Policy, a food tax was; imposed and the peasant was left free to dispose by sale of such surplus as he might possess after providing for his own requirements; this freedom was in practice restricted by the fact that the Government was the principal buyer. The rood tax was originally collected in eighteen different products, a most cumbrous procedure. In the spring of 1922, the &quot; single food tax &quot; was introduced, computed in rye units, still payable in kind, but in six products only. In 1923 the tax was partly commuted for a cash payment and partly still paid in kind. In 1924 the tax became a graduated income tax, payable entirely in cash, and assessed upon the area cultivated, the number of livestock, and the yield per desyatin.This gradual recourse to cash payments is a characteristic of Soviet economic history during the last two years and has led to the stabilisation of the currency, an account of which will be given in its place. The importance of the change from the standpoint of this chapter is, however, that it to some extent allows the control of the price of grain to pass from the Government to the producer. So long as the Government collects some, if only a part, of the produce in the form of taxation at the close of the harvest, it possesses a reserve by which it can influence the market price at the very moment when the peasant is bound to sell to obtain ready cash.  With the whole of the grain at the disposal of the peasant, even though* See Table V.t See Tables IV and VI.
the Government has means of ensuring that it shall itself be the principal purchaser of grain, and even though the peasant may in fact require to sell the bulk of his stock immediately in order to pay his tax and to provide for current requirements, it may still be possible for him to withhold a proportion (if the price does not suit him), which, however small, may be absolutely vital to the Government, whether for purposes of export or for the victualling of the urban population. The Government has not failed to notice this change in the situation, and now aims at accumulating by purchase a large grain reserve by which to control the market.Soviet Industrial Policy and its Results.22. The industrial problem was of a different character and received a different solution. The field of action was smaller, but more complicated. Industry is by nature less homogeneous than agriculture, and its role was fundamentally of less importance in the national economy of the country. Nevertheless, there were two reasons why the Soviet leaders regarded the problem of industry as a pressing one from the start. In the first place, Russia being cut off from the rest of the world, the peasant was dependent on the products of internal industry for the goods he required in exchange for his surplus grain; and secondly, industry was manned bystances it is not surprising to find that industry has been a more important field for Socialist and Communist experiment than agriculture.23. The first step was nationalisation accompanied by workers&apos; control. During the first eight months of the Soviet regime, no less than 75 per cent, of all industrial enterprises became State property and were run on Communist lines, that it to say, were under the control of the workers themselves or of the trade unions. Nationalisation was dictated, not by considerations of economic necessity, but simply by the desire to complete the expropriation of.the bourgeoisie. Lenin in vain counselled caution and urged that the workers should wait until they had learnt how to manage the factories, but the forces of anarchy could not be restrained. The Supreme Council of National Economy was created in 1918 to co-ordinate industrial production throughout the country, but, though it could claim that by 1921 it had brought into being a new trade union apparatus for the management of industry in replacement of the outworn capitalist organisation, that it had organised the whole of national industry upon a single plan, and that it was working on a single definite programme of production and distribution on a compulsory basis, yet the only results that could, upon a most liberal interpretation, be termed satisfactory were obtained in the industries subsidiary to war purposes, where the strong hand of Trotski could be felt, or in isolated factories here and there, where energetic individuals, ruthlessly determined to get their own way, were at the head of affairs.24. The New Economic Policy transformed the organisation of industry. The day of the trade unions as organisers of production was over, and the era of State capitalism began. The new policy was one both of concentration and of decentralisation-tion. Only the best situated and most efficient works and factories were included in the scheme, and they were grouped according to the nature Of the industry, the management of each group being delegated to a State trust which was expected to work on an economic basis. The primary industries coal, iron, petroleum and the so-called heavy industries- metallurgical and chemical engineering were completely organised as trusts and remained wholly under State control. In smaller industries working direct for the consumer (textiles, food, tobacco, clothing, &amp;c), only the larger factories were given to the trusts, the smaller and less productive being leased to private enterprise^ Small scale and home industry, of course, remained in private hands. It was hoped that this reorganisation would result in a more efficient management, lower overhead charges and a greater volume of production at a lower cost. &quot; I am reproached,&quot; said Lenin, &quot; for my intention to introduce State capitalism info Russia. If anybody could realise what State capitalism would mean for Soviet Russia, he would know, if he were not mad or had not filled his head Avith extracts from little pamphlets, that it would be the salvation of Russia.&quot;25. The question whether and to what extent these hopes were realised will be examined later; but it would be as well to state here and now that there has* By the end of 1921, 406 State trusts had been established, controlling over 4,000 enterprises and employing nearly a million workmen. During the same period over 10,000 enterprises were leased, of which 58 per cent, to private capitalists, 36 per cent, to co-operative societies and workers&apos; organisations and 5 per cent, to local Soviet institutions.the very creators and upholdersthese circum
been, since the foundation of the trusts, a slow but apparently steady rise in the production of State industry. Even after making every allowance for the fact that the various invasions of Russia fell with especial force upon those regions which are the source of raw materials and the site of large-scale manufacture more particularly the Donets Basin, the Caucasus and the Urals the results cannot be regarded as brilliant, but their tendency cannot be denied. For example, it is true that the total value of the output of State industry was, in 1924, only 42 per cent, of that of the corresponding industries in 1913, but it nevertheless represents an increase of 93 per cent, over the production of 1922 and of 30 per cent, over the production of 1923.* Some industries have developed more rapidly than others-, the raw material industries (coal and oil) are making comparatively rapid progress, the production of coal being, in 1924, 52 per cent., and that of oil, 65 per cent., of the pre-war figure. Their production is a relatively simple process and requires less skilled organisation than, for example, the production of heavy machinery, and in fact the output of the heavy engineering industry lags far behind that of any of the others, for it is still only 20 per cent, of the pre-war figure. The lighter industries, again, which produce for the private consumer and are responsive to whatever demand there may be, have,done somewhat better, the production of the textile industry being between 40 and 50 per cent, of the pre-war value; others, like the paper and rubber industry, have done better still, with about 60 per cent.t26. It is clear, therefore, that the introduction of the New Economic Policy resulted in increased productivity both in industry and in agriculture, and to this extent that policy has justified itself. It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that, in itself, it was a complete solution of the problem. It certainly induced the peasant to produce a surplus of grain over and above his own requirements; it also, by a ruthless application of the knife to the more inefficient factories and by a new disposition of what remained, saved industry from total collapse; indeed, it did more, for, by admitting the private trader to the world of commerce with his speculative adaptability it created conditions in which the exchange of products between town and country might more actively operate; but, nevertheless, the development of this mutual commerce, which was the real problem requiring solution, still remained incomplete.-The Disproportion between Agricultural and Industrial Production and Prices. Trotski&apos;s &quot; Scissors.&quot; 27. While agricultural production has risen gradually to about 70 per cent, of the pre-war output, industrial output has risen little higher than 40 per cent. The peasant is therefore approaching the normal output more rapidly than the urban worker, with the consequence that the disproportion between the total product of agriculture and the total product of industry, already heavy in 1913, was in 1924 heavier still. Statistics show that the value of agricultural output has risen since the war from three to six times the value of industrial output.\ On the other hand, the peasant is at the present day obtaining for his product not more but actually less, in proportion, than he would have obtained before the war; for while the propor-tion of agricultural to industrial output in 1924 is higher than it was in 1913, grain is relatively cheaper than manufactured articles. To this the index figures bear witness. On the 1st December, 1924, the wholesale agricultural index was 145, and the wholesale industrial index 195, which means that, while the factory price of industrial products was twice as high as the price in 1913, the peasant received for his grain only half as much again as the pre-war price. The corresponding retail figures are 188 and 245.$ There is another important aspect of this situation. The free purchasing power of the peasant, by which is meant the net yield of his surplus produce, is estimated as being only about 40 per cent, of what it was before the war: four-fifths of this is swallowed up by personal expenditure, and only one-fifth is devoted to farm equipment; the expenditure on agricultural machinery per head is only one-tenth of what it was before the war, and on personal requirements, such as boots and clothing, rather less than half. The shrinkage in the relative purchasing power of the peasant is, therefore, considerable and has correspondingly reduced the effective demand for manufactured goods. In fact, during the autumn of 1923. the disproportion between agricultural and industrial prices was so great that the peasant was totally unable to buy and the factory to sell, and trade was at a stand-still. In October 1923, at the height of the crisis, the wholesale industrial index stood at 150,   and the wholesale agricultural index no higher than 42, the* See Table VII. t See Table IX. J See Tables IV and VII. 8 See Table XIV.
corresponding retail indexes being 244 and 107.* In other words, while the peasant was getting only half the pre-war price for his grain, he would have had to pay two-and-a-half times the pre-war price for manufactured articles, if he had been in a position to buy them; and to the consumer food was from two to three times cheaper as compared with manufactured goods than it was before the war.j28. Thus two years after the introduction of the New Economic Policy the Soviet Government was faced by a new crisis almost as serious as the crisis which had followed upon the failure of the &quot; single economic plan.&quot; The new problem differed from the earlier one in that, while the crisis of 1921 was a &quot;production crisis,&quot; the crisis of 1923 was a &quot; sales crisis.&quot; While in 1920 and 1921 the peasant refused to produce, in 1923, although he had grown a fair harvest, he could get nothing in return for it. The whole exchange of commodities between town and country had broken down.29. The relation between agricultural and industrial prices was likened by Trotski to a pair of scissors, the two blades of which represent the two respective sets of prices. When the two sets of prices are in their pre-war relation the scissors are closed; the greater the divergence from the pre-war relation the wider the angle between the blades. The history of the relation between agricultural and industrial prices from 1921 onwards is, in terms of scissors, as follows : From 1921 to September 1922 the blades were slowly closing, the &quot;agricultural&quot; blade being uppermost; by September 1922 the scissors had completely closed; between September 1922 and October 1923 they opened fast, the industrial blade now uppermost, until in the latter month they reached their greatest divergence; after October 1923 they began to draw together again, and have continued to do so, on the whole, until the present day.t Bhit, as has been shown, they are not yet completely closed, and they still remain a part of the Soviet economic problem. It is therefore the more necessary to enquire into the causes of the great crisis of 1923 and the measures adopted to meet it.The Causes of the &quot;Sales Crisis.&quot;30. Soviet economic history since the introduction of the New Economic Policy may therefore be said to fall into two periods : the first from 1921 to the closing of the scissors in the autumn of 1922 and the second from the autumn of 1922 onwards.  The first is the period of higher grain prices, the second the period of lower grain prices. The first period does not call for detailed treatment, but it will nevertheless be useful to enquire what are the general characteristics that distinguish it from the period that followed, which, since it has not yet expired, will demand a closer examination if the present economic situation of the Soviet Union is to be adequately explained. Broadly speaking, the differences are two.   There is a change in the conditions of agriculture and a change in the conditions of industry.   In the earlier period agricultural conditions produced what was known as the &quot; dictatorship of bread.&quot; The harvests of 1920 and 1921 were bad the latter so bad, partly owing to restriction of sowing and partly owing to climatic conditions, that it was followed by a famine. Such grain as there was commanded a very high price.   Industry, on the other hand, though heavily subsidised by the State, had little working capital and no credit facilities and could therefore not wait for payment; it was obliged to sell at inopportune moments at a heavy loss for the sake of obtaining ready cash.   The Soviet rouble was comparatively stable during the summer of 1922, and such peasants as could buy obtained good value for their money at the expense of industry.  By the autumn of 1922, however, the beneficial effects of the New Economic Policy began to show themselves, and the harvest of that year was a good one.    There was. over-production in agriculture as compared with industry; the accumulation in the hands of the Government of the proceeds of the grain tax enabled them to influence the market, and in the late autumn grain prices began to fall.   Meanwhile industrial conditions were radically affected  by  the  introduction of the new chervonets bank-notes at the end of 1922, which were issued for the express purpose of meeting the requirements of industrial finance.   Industry achieved thereby greater financial stability, even if its efficiency remained unaffected, and it also recovered the commer-cial initiative which agriculture had hitherto enjoyed.   With solid stable capital and credit from the banks, industry was no longer compelled to undersell; it could fix its prices in stable monetary units and (within limits) wait for its market.    The chervonets, however, was at first only issued in small quantities for purposes of industrial credit, and did not come into general circulation until much later.   The* See Table XIV.t See Table XV.
peasants still received Soviet roubles for their grain, and unfortunately, with the introduction of the chervonets, the Soviet rouble began to depreciate once again more rapidly than ever. Living for the most part at great distances from any banking institution, the peasants were unable to avail themselves of such facilities as existed for the insurance of rouble deposits against depreciation. The tokens of their purchasing power wasted in their hands; industry might wait for its markets if it pleased; the longer it waited the smaller the market grew. Industry was working on a stable chervonets basis, agriculture on an unstable rouble basis; there was not only a differentiation of value, but prices were expressed in two increasingly diverging currencies; and the scissors were opening under the pressure of both forces.31. In addition to these two primary causes for the appearance of this new movement in prices, namely, the revival of grain production and the introduction of the chervonets as the currency for industrial purposes, there were other contributory factors which gave the movement added momentum, and at length produced the deadlock of the autumn of 1923. The position was that, although it was becoming cheaper and cheaper to feed the urban workers, the State industries were so inefficient that they were quite unable to cheapen production, and, although they were producing only 30 per cent, of the pre-war output, the purchasing power of the peasant was so reduced that they were left with more and more of that output on their hands.32. Between September 1922 and October 1923 the weaknesses of State capitalism, as established in 1921, were laid bare. State enterprises were extravagant both as producers and as distributors. Although they were expected to work on &quot;commercial principles,&quot; all that this meant in practice was that they no longer received direct supplies of food and raw material from State sources, but had to buy in the open market or from other State institutions. The principal industries, as well as transport and foreign trade, were nationalised and were therefore removed from the pale of competition and enjoyed a monopoly; there was none of the incentive to initiative and responsibility characteristic of capitalist enterprises, nor the fear of immediate retribution for mismanagement; the principal preoccupation of employees was to obtain covering authority for their every act rather than to further the interests of production; it was easy for the trusts by book transactions to show illusory profits, and there was always a State subsidy to fall back upon as a last resort. Costs of production were kept high by the maintenance of inefficient factories, by &quot;Communist&quot; instead of &quot;expert&quot; management and by the heavy costs of raw material, due to the fact that this was itself either produced by other State enter-prises or else subject to excessive charges for transport. Overhead charges were double those of pre-war days. Rates and taxes themselves imposed in part for the payment of subsidies were also much heavier. Costs of distribution were large because the commodity passed through the hands of a succession of State or similar organisations, so that, for example, a yard of calico might increase in price in its passage from factory to consumer from two to seventeen times according to the number of hands through which it passed. In the autumn of 1923 a plough cost the peasant four times as much in grain as it did a year previously.33. The management of the trusts was not, however, solely responsible for this state of affairs. Part of the blame must be laid on the urban worker himself. The description which follows is drawn from more recent data, but unfavourable as are the conditions thus disclosed, they yet show a distinct advance upon those ruling during the period now under review. The fact is that the worker in State enterprises, unlike the peasant, is on the whole overpaid for the work he does. It is true that the purchasing power of wages is on the average only 70 per cent, of the purchasing power of the pre-war wage,* but on the other hand the productivity of the worker is only on the average about 55 per cent, of the pre-war figure. The legal working day is nominally eight hours, but the Bolsheviks themselves admit that the average effective working day is four hours only, the balance being occupied by absences, loitering, malingering, meetings, demonstrations, or party work. According to M. Dzerzhinski, President of the Supreme Council of National Economy, 80,000 workers in State metallurgical works now produce only a third of the output of 100,000 workers before the war. At some of the heavy industry factories the disproportion between wages and output is flagrant; at the Briansk works, for example, wages were at the end of 1924 63 per cent, and production only 37 per cent, of the pre-war average. On these facts, it is clear that to the inefficiency of the Communist as a worker, no less than
to his inefficiency as a manager, must be ascribed the inability of State enterprise to produce at a price at which the produce could be sold.The Results of the &quot;Sales Crisis.&quot;34. The results of the sales crisis made themselves more and more apparent; stocks accumulated unsold; retail prices of manufactured goods rose steadily until they were higher than in any other country in Europe; the trusts ran short of ready money and were unable to pay wages when due; numerous strikes recurred in the autumn of 1923; workmen were discharged and joined the ranks of the unemployed. By the end of 1923 there were a million workers unemployed. Trusts were running at a loss and depended for support on State subsidies, or on advances from the State Bank, or when this support was withheld they resorted to raids on their capital. The Government still had the printing press at its disposal, and granted subsidies in the financial year October 1922-October 1923 to the amount of 100 million gold roubles; bank advances, which in January 1923 amounted to only 25 million gold roubles, had risen by July to 150 million. Remedies of this kind were of course merely palliatives and indeed only tended to make matters worse, for credit inflation could only in the long run result in an increase of price, which was precisely the result it was above all desired to avoid.35. The position of the co-operative societies the approved channel for the exchange of commodities between town and country was equally parlous. Their liquid resources were fully absorbed by the purchase of grain, while their goods lay unsold in their warehouses, the banks and trusts meanwhile pressing for repayment of loans or for settlement for goods supplied. In September 1923 &quot;Centrosoyuz &quot; was in the debt of the trusts and banks for the sum of 11 million gold roubles. As for the peasant, unable to satisfy his needs by purchase, he was returning to the home industry that had served him before factories had been heard of.36. The peasant, upon whom all feed, had in 1921 almost ceased to feed any but himself. In 1923 the purchasing power of the peasant, upon which almost alone industry depends, faded to nothing, and the economic machine was once more threatened with breakdown. It was plainly necessary to restore the purchasing power of the peasant so that he might again set the wheels of industry going, and to stimulate State industry, to bear at least a part of its burden so that the task might not be beyond the capacity of the peasant.The Remedies: Reform of the Trusts.37. The first step towards the reform of the trusts was a declaration by the Congress of the Russian Communist Party in March 1923 that in future &quot;profit must be a criterion of successful management.&quot; But the trusts did not mend their ways. They merely increased prices so that should their goods be sold there would be no doubt about showing a profit; if their goods were not sold, they put them down as assets at the enhanced price and showed a profit all the same. Decrees were issued in April and July 1923 reaffirming the autonomous character of the State trusts and emphasising their obligation to stand upon their own feet as independent profit-seeking economic units; but it was plain that something more drastic was required than resolutions and decrees. The measures adopted were three. First, a new &quot; purge &quot; was carried out on the lines of that of 1921. Weak trusts were liquidated, and weak factories in otherwise sound trusts were shut down; that is to say, a new policy of concentration was adopted. Non-productive clerical and unskilled staffs were reduced. In the cotton industry, for example, 14 per cent, of the spindles and looms were stopped, and 14 per cent, of the hands dismissed, but the same output was to be produced, notwithstanding that over 50 per cent, of it could not be sold. Secondly, advances against goods and credits for industrial purposes were cut down, and bills were only sparingly accepted for discount, for the State bank had become alarmed at the expansion of credit, which was beginning to threaten the position of the chervonets. It was hoped that the immediate effect of the interruption of the flow of credit would be to force the trusts to realise their goods on the market, but this hope was not realised, and the situation, so far as the trusts were concerned, was so little improved that in October 1923 the third even more drastic step was taken of cutting the price of all manufactured goods of common consumption by an average of 25 per cent. It was essential to -convince the trusts that now that the chervonets had come and had at all costs to
be safeguarded, the days of unlimited subsidy were over, and that their one object must in future be to produce goods cheaply and at a profit.38. There were Communists who disapproved of these measures on the ground that the whole trouble was due to &quot;capitalist anarchy&quot; resulting from the New Economic Policy itself, and that the true remedy was a return to militant Communism, a new State plan, and the suppression of the spirit of commercialism and all idea of profit. To this the dominant section of the party retorted that there was a new State plan, and that a stable currency and a balanced budget were part of it. Others suggested that the price of manufactured articles should be averaged &apos;&apos; by purchases from abroad, but the suggestion was not entertained. There was also much talk of increasing the productivity of labour, but the moment was not yet ripe for any definite measure in this direction.Grain Prices and the Peasant&apos;s Purchasing Power: The Need for a New Currency.39. It cannot be said that any of the remedies adopted brought any very con-siderable reduction in the price of manufactured goods. The most that can be claimed for them is that they prevented prices from rising further. The retail industrial index, which touched its highest point at 244 in October 1923, has at no time since then been lower than 213,* and is now again approaching its maximum. On the other hand, the measures which were taken to increase the purchasing power of the peasant were more successful. Food prices, which stood at 107 in October 1923, rose rapidly to about 200 in April 1924, and they have remained in the neighbourhood of that figure ever since.* The first of these remedies was the gradual commutation of the food tax from a tax in kind to a cash payment, the effect of which was, as has been explained in paragraph 21 above, to restore to the peasant his power to drive a bargain for his surplus. The second was the resumption of grain export. During the spring and summer of 1923, 700,000 tons of the 1922 harvest were exported, followed, during the winter of 1923 and spring of 1924, by 3 million tons of the 1922 harvest. Both measures raised grain prices to a higher level, t The general effect of the attempt of the Soviet Government to liquidate the &quot; scissors &quot; crisis was, there-fore, that prices of manufactured goods remained stationary and prices of agricul-tural goods rose to meet them; and by April 1924 the two blades, as representing retail prices, had once more been brought together for the first time since 1922. There was still, however, a divergence in wholesale prices, to the disadvantage of agriculture 440. It might seem, therefore, that the problem had been largely solved, but in actual fact this was far from being so. In a general sense, no doubt, prices had been readjusted, but the essential thing was not simply to readjust prices but to promote a more active exchange of commodities, and this had not yet taken place. The peasant did not at first react to any great extent to the apparent increase in his purchasing power. There were two reasons for this. In the first place, he had supplied his more immediate needs from the revived home industries; he also expected that prices of manufactured goods, having once been cut in October 1923, would be cut again; he found, on the contrary, that in the early months of 1924 industrial prices, instead of falling, were once more displaying a tendency to rise. In the cir-cumstances he preferred to keep his grain. In the second place, if he did sell it, lie had only a small quantity to dispose of and was not likely to get as much as one chervonets in any one transaction. Thus, although the chervonets was by now in general circulation, the Soviet rouble was still the only currency issued in small denominations, and the limited produce of any individual peasant was still paid for in Soviet roubles. The Soviet rouble was depreciating more rapidly than ever in con-sequence, as it happened, of a huge emission in the autumn of 1923 for the financing of that very export operation to which the peasant owed the rise in the price of grain; so that, while the rouble helped to create his new purchasing power, it destroyed it again before he could employ it. Clearly, the purchasing power of the peasant, however high the price of grain, could never consolidate itself until it was expressed in a stable currency of small denomination. It was not enough to have adjusted price relations. The parallel currencies, which had provoked the sales crisis, were perpetuating it.4.0a. By the end of 1923 the blades of the scissors had been forced somewhat closer together.   They were closed a little more by new outs in prices (this time agricultural* See Table XIV, column B.-j- This rise is reflected in the course of the retail agricultural index shown in Table XIV, column B. % See Table XV.
-as well as industrial) in February 1924, aimed at the private trader, who was driving the co-operative societies out of the distributive trade, and was supposed to be finding large profits in the margin between wholesale and retail prices. But there was no effective revival in the demand for manufactured goods until after the completion of the currency reform in May 1924, when the Soviet rouble was withdrawn and replaced by a stable Treasury currency. How this currency was introduced will be described in the course of the following chapter.III. Soviet Currency.41. The history of Soviet currency falls naturally into four periods : The first, from the Revolution to the introduction of the chervonets in November 1922; during this period the Soviet rouble is in circulation together with whatever money tokens of the old regime still remain.The second, from the introduction of the chervonets to the introduction of the Soviet Treasury note (November 1922-February 1924); the Soviet rouble and the chervonets are in circulation simultaneously.The third, from the introduction of the Soviet Treasury note to the withdrawal from circulation of the Soviet rouble (February-April 1924); the Soviet rouble, the chervonets.and the Soviet Treasury note are all in circulation simultaneously.The fourth, from the withdrawal of the Soviet rouble onwards (April 1924 to date); the chervonets and the Soviet Treasury note are in circulation simultaneously.The First Period: The Soviet Rouble.42. The catastrophic history of the Soviet rouble is notorious. From the Revolution to the introduction of the New Economic Policy the Soviet rouble was not really a State currency at all. It was still thought possible to organise the country on principles which excluded capitalist relations between man and man, of which relationship a currency is the outward and visible sign, and, in fact, the indispensable medium. Nevertheless, there still persisted an irresistible demand for the maintenance of these relations, however illegitimate, and they were still maintained underground with the connivance of the Government. Currency was issued, not, of course, in order that contraband trading might be encouraged, but because the existence of such trading gave currency a value and made the operation of issue a source of profit to the Government. There was neither taxation nor a budget, and currency was no part of the State financial organisation; it was issued irresponsibly and without regard to its value or stability in fact, its uninterrupted devaluation was welcomed by some as a means of destroying the last remains of capitalism with its own weapon by a reductio ad dbsurdum; paper money of previous non-Bolshevik issues was even printed, as it was found that they still passed current in some districts. By a decree of the Council of People&apos;s Commissaries of the 15th May, 1919, the administration was authorised to issue paper money &quot; to the extent of the actual requirements of the national economy.&quot; In other words, no limit of any kind was imposed.43. With the introduction of the New Economic Policy in the spring of 1921 the situation changed. The legalisation of certain capitalist relationships, the re-emergence of the idea of price, the establishment of State trusts for the conduct of industry, the consequent demand for banking and credit facilities, and the necessity for taxation and a budget made currency again a recognised indispensable medium of exchange for which the State must take responsibility, and not simply regard as a means of profit to itself. When the new policy was introduced in the summer of 1921, the rouble had fallen to about 1/12,000 of its pre-war value in relation to the  , and the total issue amounted to 3 or 4 million million roubles. This figure was the nominal equivalent of 2,000 times the total pre-war issue.44. The increase in the trade turnover consequent upon the introduction of the New Economic Policy, the new dignity conferred on the rouble by the restoration of official status, and the reintroduction of taxation might have been expected to steady the downward course of the rouble; none the less, the descent continued. In 1922 a new issue of the so-callecl &quot; 1922 roubles&quot; was made, one rouble of this issue being equivalent to 10,000 of any previous issue; a year later the &quot; 1923 roubles &quot; was issued, equivalent to 100
&quot; 1922 roubles&quot; or 1,000,000 of earlier issues. The only effect of these manoeuvres, was to eliminate cyphers. The printing press continued to turn out roubles by the million in order to meet budget deficits, the nominal issue reached fantastic figures., and the purchasing power of the currency melted away.45. The disadvantages of such a position are obvious. Costing and accounting were impossible. The budget was meaningless, and there were no means of discovering whether State industries were or were not making a profit, whatever their balance sheets might show. Efforts were made to find a real basis for calculation independent of the financial exigencies of the State; one standard adopted was the &quot;gold rouble,&quot; which was reckoned as the price in Soviet roubles of a gold rouble; another was the &quot; goods rouble,&quot; which represented the cost in Soviet roubles of a selection of goods which before the war could be bought for a rouble. In 1922 and 1923 State finance, including the budget and taxes, were calculated in gold roubles; wages were calculated in goods roubles; but all cash transactions were nominally conducted in the paper rouble, which halved in value once a month. As a matter of fact, however, foreign currencies were by this time coming into general use as a medium of exchange for internal purposes, though naturally such transactions were technically illegal.The Second Period: The Chervonets Bank-note.46. The uselessness of the Soviet rouble for accounting purposes and the chaos resulting from official and unofficial attempts, under pressure of the growing economic life of the State, to discover a reliable criterion of value made the establishment of a stable currency imperative, if the Soviet Government in fact intended to pursue the path into which it had been driven by the agricultural crisis in 1921. It was in these conditions that by a decree of the 11th October, 1922, the State Bank was given power to issue bank-notes called chervontsi, the chervonets being the name of a gold coin which, if it existed, would contain the same amount of gold as a pre-war 10 rouble gold piece. The new bank-notes were issued in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 25 chervontsi, each chervonets being worth 10 &quot; chervonny   roubles.47. The chervonets was not a State Treasury note like the Soviet rouble but a bank-note issued under conditions, the stringency of which, together with the limited character and attributes of the note itself, shows with what circumspection the Soviet Government took its first step on the path of sound finance, The notes were not to be legal tender; they were to be inconvertible; they were to be issued only under cover, 25 per cent, of which was to consist of metal or stable foreign currency and the remaining 75 per cent, of good short-period bills or easily realisable goods. In regard to cover, the State Bank has done better than the letter of its bond; the first issue was secured by gold alone as to almost 100 per cent.; at the end of 1924 the issue, which now amounted to about 600 million chervonny roubles, was still secured by gold alone as to almost 28 per cent., and by metal and stable foreign currency together as to over 40 per cent., that is to say, nearly double-of what the decree requires.48. The chervonets was not at first legal tender, nor was it issued to serve as a medium for hand-to-hand transactions. It was issued to State enterprises, against acceptable security for industrial and general productive purposes, and as loans issued in chervontsi by the State Bank were to be repaid in chervontsi, the whole of the finance of Soviet State trade and industry were soon reorganised upon a chervonets basis, and the chervonets became the money of account. It was not intended at first to circulate side by side with, or to be freely interchangeable with, the Soviet rouble. The latter still continued to be issued in increasing quantities for budgetary purposes. The initial issue of chervontsi, on the other hand, was small and the issue was only very gradually increased. The bulk of the issue had at first a very restricted circulation among State institutions. Such notes as filtered down to the general public were, of course, easily exchangeable for commodities or for Soviet roubles. But though the banks could buy, they could not sell, chervontsi for roubles; and while chervontsi could be bought for gold at their face value, gold could not be given by the banks in exchange for chervontsi. Notwithstanding all these precautions, it was hardly expected that the chervonets would preserve its exchange value. It did, nevertheless, in its first year (1923) maintain itself within a few points of parity with the dollar except about the-time of Lord Curzon&apos;s ultimatum of May 1923, when it fell heavily.*
49. During the year 1923 a change took place in the function of the chervonets.. By the end of that year the chervonets had replaced the Soviet rouble as the principal currency of the Union. On the 1st January, 1923, the gold values of the total issues of chervontsi and Soviet roubles respectively were as 1 to 10. A year later they were as 5 to 1, the issue of chervontsi being worth 280 million gold roubles, while the value of the colossal Soviet paper issue had declined from 114 to 58 millions.*Hoio the Chervonets was Established: The Parallel Currencies.50. For a year and a half, from December 1922 to May 1924, these two incon-gruous currencies circulated in parallel and provided what is surely one of the most piquant comedies in the history of finance. There was the chervonets, an inconvertible bank-note with statutorily established cover, issued in carefully measured quantities for the most legitimate purposes by Dr. Jekyll; and the Soviet paper rouble, the most disreputable of all currencies, issued in almost measureless, numbers for that most disreputable of purposes, the meeting of budgetary deficits  by Mr. Hyde. Further, the stable chervonets, injected into the Soviet financial system in small cumulative doses, was reducing the Soviet rouble, still the sole legal tender of the country, to the status of small change. The Government made a vain effort to stem the course of the paper rouble by limiting&apos;the gold value of the monthly issue for budget purposes to 30 million roubles from May 1923 onwards and to 15 million roubles from August onwards. But they were compelled in the autumn to make issues of Soviet roubles to the value of at least 50 million gold roubles over and above this; the official explanation was that this issue was made for &quot; credit &quot;&apos; purposes, but it was, in fact, made to provide more small change for the chervonets and to finance the harvest.51. By September 1923, owing to this increased emission, to the rumours of the projected withdrawal from circulation of the paper rouble currency and to the very fact of the existence of the chervonets, the flight from the paper rouble reached its-final catastrophic stage. In November the chervonets was worth more&apos; in terms of Soviet roubles on the Black Bourse than on the official exchange, while the pound sterling was worth less than its official quotation a demonstration both, of the flight, from the rouble and of the strength of the position now occupied by the chervonets. even face to face with foreign currency. It was still not legal tender, but it had become the currency of the country. Foreign currency was no longer a dangerous rival as a means of exchange, and its importation into the country was therefore no longer forbidden, but its purchase and sale still remained a monopoly of the State Bank. Prices were expressed in chervontsi; gold coin had been almost eliminated as a measure of value; and foreign currenc3^ had fallen out of use as a medium of internal exchange. From December 1923 onwards the official exchange rate of the chervonets began to be quoted directly in terms of the   sterling and the dollai, and not indirectly through the equivalent of each in Soviet roubles as hitherto.52. The fall of the Soviet rouble had these disadvantages, that it rendered the rouble increasingly ineffective as a means of covering deficits and, in the end, inadequate even in its new role of small change to the chervonets. Further, as has been shown in the preceding chapter, it prevented the effective purchasing power of the peasant from rising with the price of grain, and perpetuated the &quot; scissors &quot; crisis. What was perhaps even more serious was that the rouble now began to drive/ the chervonets out of circulation. The original function of the chervonets was, as it were, to serve as a store of value for accounting purposes for the benefit of the State and its enterprises; it had subsequently acquired the most important function of a. true currency and had become a medium of exchange; but in the uncertainty of existing conditions it was now once more beginning to recover its original function, but this time it was a store of value for the public, who were hoarding their chervontsi and using their roubles for day-to-day transactions.53. The policy of the Government had been to use the rouble to protect the. chervonets until the latter was firmly established. This policy had succeeded. The chervonets was kept free from reproach; the expense of establishing the new currency fell upon the Soviet rouble that is, upon its holders. The policy was a clever one; it was also dishonest; but perhaps in the circumstances it was inevitable. It must be remembered that the problem facing the Soviet Government was in some ways more difficult, though in others more easy than that which has presented itself to other Governments. It was more difficult because the Soviet rouble was beyond repair, because the Government
had no credit, moral or financial, either at home or abroad, and because the volume of trade was not large enough to take up a new currency thrown in bulk upon the market. The process therefore had to be a slow one; the Government had to create a belief among its own institutions and the public that there was one thing if only one in regard to which its intentions were firm and unmistakable, and it had carefully to test the capacity of the market to absorb the 4 millions of chervontsi that were issued each month. On the other hand, the problem was easier as all the problems of the Soviet Government are easier because Russia is in an elementary stage of development and has no unmanageably large trade movement; because where there is a low degree of organisation there is small risk of dislocation; and, finally and chiefly, because the Government has a political authority over the daily lives ot the people unknown elsewhere, and governs a population that has no practical knowledge of the rights of man and few preoccupations other than that of obtaining the barest necessities of existence.54. The introduction of the chervonets and its circulation side by side with the Soviet rouble undoubtedly had a most disturbing effect on the Soviet national economy and lay at the root of the &quot; scissors &quot; crisis, which remained more or less acute so long as the parallel circulation continued. But it is difficult to see what other method could have been chosen. When in 1922 the decision to issue the bank-notes was taken, it was industry rather than agriculture that stood in need of support: agriculture was already upon its feet; industry was not. The Government had for political reasons a special duty towards industry and a direct responsibility for its welfare. It was therefore inevitable that, if, as circumstances in fact demanded, the new currency had to be issued slowly and to be carefully watched and controlled, it should be used in the first place for the service of industry, which was under the eye of the Government, rather than of agriculture, where its operations would be less easy to follow. Its effect on industry was, as has been shown, double edged. It gave the State enterprises stable capital, credit, initiative and, for a time, command of the market, but in the end they paid too dearly for their privileged position, for the gap between the two currencies killed their market.55. As for the peasant, it is clear that here, as always-he paid, but in this particular instance he paid twice over. In the first place, the chervonets&apos;, owing to its special and restricted circulation, only came slowly into the hands of even the urban workers and did not for a very long time reach the hands of the peasants; there was a growing chervonets circulation in industry and a purely rouble circulation in agriculture; the peasants were therefore paying more than their due share of the disguised tax, which was the true character of the rouble issue. In the second place, the existence of a stable currency in industry and an unstable currency in agriculture tended, as has already been shown, to differentiate the scale of values current in the two spheres; the peasants were there-fore not only paying for the instability of the rouble, but also for the stability of the chervonets. It was not until the Soviet rouble was withdrawn from circulation and the Treasury rouble took its place that the balance between industry and agriculture could begin to readjust itself.Third Period: The Treasury Rouble Note.56. The immediate cause of the issue of Treasury roubles was the shortage of small change. By the end of 1923 the gold value of all the currency in circulation of smaller denomination than 1 chervonets, that is to say, of the total issue of Soviet roubles, was only 15 per cent, of the value of the total currency, as compared with 40 per cent, before the war. The alternative remedies were to issue chervontsi in fractions, or to replace the Soviet rouble by a new currency. Though the chervonets was by now firmly established, it was thought unwise to depart from the strict letter of the decree and to increase the issue even for necessary and legitimate currency purposes. Instead, a new Treasury issue was made, which, as it was (unlike the Soviet rouble) to be freehy exchangeable at par with the chervonets in either direction, would test the chervonets quite severely enough, and would at the same time provide, if necessity arose, a line of defence for the chervonets, much as the Soviet rouble had been.57. The operation was carried out under the &quot;February decrees.&quot; By the decree of the 5th February, 1924, the Commissariat of Finance was authorised to issue Treasury notes in denominations of 1, 3 and 5 roubles, which were to be legal tender at their nominal gold value, the total issue not to exceed in value one-half of the total amount of chervontsi in circulation.   Unlike the chervontsi,
they were to be the official State currency and full legal tender, but would not be-quoted on the foreign exchange market. Unlike the Soviet rouble, they were by decision of the Government to be freely interchangeable in both directions with the chervonets, and they took the place of the Soviet rouble as a subsidiary coinage for purposes of small change. They were, of course, to be used for budget purposes to the extent* foreseen in the estimates for the then current year (1923-24), but the decision of the Government to bind the new uncovered, conventional paper currency to the chervonets shows how great was their confidence in the chervonets, how firm their intention to discontinue as early as possible the use of paper currency for budgetary purposes, and how high their estimate of the confidence in financial matters-which they had been able to create in the public mind. The first small issue of Treasury notes was made at the end of February, and for three months the three currencies (chervonets, Soviet rouble, Treastiry note) circulated together.By a second decree of the 14th February, 1924, the printing and issue of Soviet paper roubles was to cease from the 15th February, but they were to remain legal tender until finally withdrawn from circulation.By a third decree of the 22nd February, 1924, the issue of silver coins of denominations of 50, 20, 15 and 10 kopeks, and of copper coins in denominations of 5, 3, 2 and 1 kopeks was sanctioned; these metallic token currencies were designed to supplement the Treasury note as small change, to be legal tender for limited amounts, and to be included in the quota of Treasury notes to be issued under the decree of the 5th February.Fourth Period; Withdrawal of the Soviet Rouble.58. Finally, on the 7th March, a decree appeared authorising the exchange of Soviet paper roubles against Treasury notes, at the rate of 50,000 1923 roubles (i.e... 50,000 million original Soviet roubles) to 1 gold rouble. The operation was to be completed by the 10th April, but the period was later extended to the 10th May. Further, the State Bank and the Commissariat of Finance were forbidden to re-issue Soviet roubles for circulation after the 25th March; this period was extended later to the 25th April. This was the end of the Soviet rouble. In its last days, before the exchange against Treasury notes began, the total issue had reached 800 thousand million million (800,000,000,000,000,000) of the original issue. To the last, the Government mulcted the unfortunate holders of Soviet roubles. The rate fixed for redemption on the 7th March was four times less favourable to the holder than the market rate ruling three weeks before, when the issue of roubles ceased. The total issue was redeemed for 15 million gold roubles, or something over  1,500,000, which means that the cost to the Soviet Government of the redemption of what had been during several years its legal tender, its principal source of revenue and the basis of the economic life of the country, was 15 million Treasury rouble notes,, representing at present an obligation to pay 1,500,000 chervontsi on demand, but perhaps destined in the future to follow in the downward path of the notes which they redeemed. It may, perhaps, be a matter of surprise to some that anything was paid at all.59. Once the issue of a new subsidiary currency had been decided upon, it was natural that every effort should be made from the first to play for stability, that is for the free convertibility between Treasury notes and chervontsi. There was con-siderable doubt whether the chervonets could at one and the same instant dispense with the support of the rouble and bear the burden of the Treasury note. Initial lack of confidence in the Treasury note might cause a run on the chervonets, and its total disappearance from circulation. For this reason the Government retained the power to introduce inconvertibility by a stroke of the pen, if necessity arose, and to relieve the chervonets of pressure by allowing the Treasury note freely to fix its own internal exchange value. The Commissariat of Finance also, took the wise and uncovenanted step of building up a reserve of chervontsi (at present 12,000,000) as security for the Treasury note. The experiment has so far been, successful. The authorised proportion of currency of small denomination (half the value of the chervonets issue, i.e., one-third of the total currency issue) has not proved excessive, and the two notes are still exchanged freely at par.The Position and Prospects of the Chervonets.   Has there been over-issue f60. The effect of the completed currency reform upon the general economic life of the country and upon the power of the Government to shape its development willIn fact about one-third of the issue was so used.
lie considered in a later chapter. The remainder of the present chapter will be devoted to an examination of the position and prospects of the chervonets,61&quot;. The principal immediate cause of the depreciation of a currency is generally the issue of it in quantities appreciably in excess of the minimum amount which the economic life of the society normally requires in order that the exchange of commodities, in which that economic life essentially consists, may not be hampered for lack of a medium in which to conduct it. M. Sokoinikov said in his budget speech in October last that the issue of chervontsi had been and would be strictly proportioned to the legitimate requirements of trade, and that the chervonets would not be issued to bolster up unproductive enterprises or to cover budget deficits There is no reason whatever to doubt that the Soviet Government will, so long as is humanly possible, abide by its decision so to limit the issue of chervontsi. Indeed, so great is its solicitude for the stability of the chervonets that it is likely to underestimate rather than to overestimate the amount of currency which the volume of trade requires, the more so as an over-issue would be liable not only to impair the reputation of the chervonets, but to jeopardise the position of the bank of issue  the State Bank and consequently of the whole banking system of the country, which is dependent on that bank. Whether or not the actual issue is in fact closely proportioned to the existing volume of trade is a question to which it is impossible to give a positive answer, but such evidence as there is goes to show that it must be a fair approximation.62. For example, the total value of the present issue of chervontsi and Treasury roubles, together with the 150 million roubles in gold which M. Sokoinikov estimates is still in circulation or hoarded, amounts to about 1,050 million gold roubles, or about half the pre-war circulation of 2,250 gold roubles. The foregoing chapter has shown that the value of the total national production is somewhere about two-thirds of the pre-war figure. The total trade turnover may be taken as bearing about the same proportion, so that the currency issue would -primA facie appear to be very fairly measured. The economic system of the Soviet Union, however, differs so greatly from that of Imperial Russia that such analogies are of doubtful value : it is not known, for example, whether State capitalism as a system, requires more currency or less currency than private capitalism in order to do an equal amount of work.63. The presumption that there is probably no over-issue is also on the whole confirmed by the behaviour of the chervonets itself. In a society organised on the basis of freedom of exchange, internal and external (which the Soviet Union is not), the three signs of over-issue of paper currency do not fail to appear, namely, a premium on gold, a fall in the rate of exchange, a rise in nominal prices. The control of the Soviet Government over the economic system of the country is, however, such that even though none of these signs were manifested it would not be safe to infer that no over-issue of chervontsi had occurred, though the presumption would be that none had occurred; on the other hand, a rise in nominal prices will not be necessarily attributable to an over-issue of currency. It will be useful, nevertheless, to examine the behaviour of the chervonets in these three respects.The Testimony of the Price Level.64. The price level seems at first sight to tell against the chervonets. In December 1922 when the chervonets was introduced, the index of retail prices expressed in chervontsi was 130, compared with an equivalent pre-war figure of 100; the index rose to 1.88 by August 1923, and after falling a little in the winter of that year, rose above 200. early in 1924. At the end of 1924 it was 220, that is to say. 60 per cent, higher than when the currency was introduced.* Against this it should be noted that the index of December 1922 represents prices converted from the rapidly depreciating Soviet rouble, and therefore likely to be low in terms of stable currency; that the introduction of a stable currency would be likely to bring prices by degrees to their true level; and tha t a considerable part of the margin between prices in the Union and world gold prices, the index of which is between 160 and 170, must be attributable to unfavourable conditions special to Soviet State capitalism, such as high.costs of production, distribution and heavy overhead charges, rather than to currency conditions alone. The rise in nominal prices in the Union since the chervonets was issued is probably due, not to over-issue, but to the fact that in the presence of a stable currency the effects of high production costs cannot be postponed  or  concealed  as  they  can be when the  currency is  rapidly and
uninterruptedly depreciating. Nominal prices are not much higher now than they were a year ago, and in the interval they have been, within fairly wide limits, stable, there has not been that steady, uninterrupted and unmistakable rise in nominal prices which is the mark of a depreciating currency.The Testimony of the Home and Foreign Exchange.65. The testimony of the home and foreign exchange is favourable to the chervonets. The outstanding facts are that since April 1924 the chervonets has stood within a very few points of parity with the 10-rouble gold piece, and sometimes even above it; and that since the same date the chervonets has been quoted on the Moscow exchange at parity with the dollar.* These facts require explanation. So far as the internal gold value of the chervonets is concerned, the position is somewhat complicated. Imperial 10 rouble gold pieces circulate in the Union, but they are not part of the official currency; they are a small remnant of the pre-war gold currency, and are used more especially in Asiatic Eussia; they may be exchanged at banks for an equal number of chervontsi, but they cannot of course be purchased from banks in return for chervontsi, for there is no free market in gold. There is, therefore, no possibility of a natural adjustment in internal purchasing power between the chervonets and gold, and the only criterion of the value of the chervonets as compared with 10 roubles gold, is its exchange value as compared with the dollar. But the chervonets is at par with the dollar, and therefore the purchasing power of the chervonets and of 10 roubles gold should be one and the same. This has not always been the situation. So long as the Soviet rouble was legal tender and quoted on the Moscow exchange in terms of foreign currency, there was a corresponding official quotation of Soviet roubles in terms of gold roubles, this latter quotation being in fact for a long time the only basis upon which most of the current transactions ii? depreciating Soviet roubles could be carried out. When the chervonets was at length issued there was also a quotation of the chervonets in terms of Soviet roubles, which was not usually identical with the quotation of 10 roubles gold in Soviet roubles, although theoretically the chervonets and the 10-rouble gold piece were of equivalent value. Finally, there was, until December 1923, no direct quotation of the chervonets in terms of foreign currency, its foreign exchange value being only ascertainable by using the Soviet rouble as a common denominator. During all this time the chervonets, while not violently imstable, was not at par either internally with 10 roubles gold or externally with the dollar, nor did its gold value and its dollar value, as calculated through the medium of the Soviet rouble, always coincide.66. It is difficult to&apos; find a satisfactory explanation of the relative instability of the foreign exchange value of the chervonets in the period before April 1924, and for its unbroken stability at par with the dollar ever since. It may or may not be a pure coincidence that the withdrawal of the Soviet rouble dates precisety from the month in question; but it is certain at any rate that the Soviet rouble is the only factor of importance which is not common to both periods, and it may well have been a disturbing factor so long as it existed, seeing that it required its own quotations in gold and foreign currency. During the unstable period, the chervonets reacted easily to political influences. There was a considerable fall at the time of Lord Curzon&apos;s ultimatum in May 1923, at which time, it may be remerbered, the State Bank was also beginning to fear that it was being too liberal with its advances to the trusts. There was another smaller fluctuation between December 1923 and April 1924, which was the period of the change from the Soviet rouble to the Treasury note; of a rapid increase in the quantity of foreign bank-notes held as cover for the chervonets, the demand for which may have depressed the chervonets; and of an acute dissension in the Communist party followed by Lenin&apos;s death. What is clear, however, from these examples is that the power of the Soviet Government to control the exchange value of the chervonets was not then (and perhaps is not now) complete; but its power to do so is, nevertheless, considerable, and has been sufficient to maintain the chervonets at dollar parity for nearly a year. The chervonets is, of course, a managed currency, but it is idle to speculate what its value would be on a free exchange market. The chervonets is part of the Soviet economic system, an essential characteristic of which has hitherto been that there shall be no free market in foreign currency. Thanks to the system, the Government has found it possible to keep the chervonets at dollar parity. In any other system the chervonets would not be chervonets, for it has no existence apart from the system. How then and within what limits has the Soviet Government controlled the foreign exchange market %
How the Government controls its Foreign Exchange Market.67. The conditions hitherto governing the foreign exchange market in chervontsi are as follows :  ,The foreign trade turnover is small, and except for purposes of foreign trade there is little demand for foreign currency in Russia or for chervontsi abroad.*  The whole of the foreign trade of the Union is a State monopoly. Its. small volume renders its strict supervision possible.   Every import or export operation is either conducted by or approved by the competent Government organHitherto every exchange operation has had to be approved by the competent authority and conducted through the State Bank or other authorised establish-ments. Purchases of foreign currency for other than specific commercial transition purposes have been strictly limited, so that the speculator has been eliminated.The export of chervontsi abroad has been prohibited.68. As a result of these conditions the great bulk of the exchange operations in chervontsi have taken place on the Moscow exchange. The Moscow rate has been the ruling rate, in fact, the only rate; and such small purchases of chervontsi as have been made abroad have been effected a,t that rate. The chervonets has not in general been independently quoted on foreign markets.69. Further, the balance of imports and exports (visible and invisible) is not, as in societies where foreign trade is predominantly in private hands, automatic. In other countries an apparent excess of exports means that the excess is somewhere balanced by invisible imports. In Soviet Russia an excess of exports means that, apart from invisible factors (which in a society of low development like Russia are small), there remains in the hands of the Government at its free disposal an amount of purchasing power abroad in the form of foreign currency or foreign credits. An excess of imports will mean, on the other hand, that it has been raiding its reserves of foreign currency.70. Although the foreign currency thus obtained may be used as cover for the chervonets, or to buy gold for the same purpose, or to make further purchases of goods abroad for sale at home, the dominant factor is that, so long as there is a balance in hand, the supply of foreign purchasing power will exceed the demand, and the price of foreign purchasing power expressed in chervontsi can, so far as this is in all the circumstances possible, be kept stable and at parity.71. The importance of the foreign trade monopoly for the currency is therefore paramount. It is the instrument by which the Soviet Government measures the volume of its foreign trade from day to day; by which it determines what is to be purchased or sold abroad, where and by whom; and by which it provides for the excess of exports that enables it to control the external value of its currency. Whether or not the Soviet Government will always be able to maintain an excess of exports is impossible to foresee, but so long as it is able and its powers in this matter are very great it will do so in virtue of its trade monopoly. At present, the trade monopoly is vital to the chervonets, and there is no prospect whatever of its abandonment. Unpopular as it is, it is not likely to be attacked and overthrown from abroad. Foreign Governments and foreign capitalists will not effectively boycott it as the peasants boycotted and destroyed the internal grain monopoly in 1921. The time may come to dispense with it if, for example, the Soviet Union were to become a more fully capitalist State, or if Soviet foreign trade were to expand beyond the possibility of strict control; but in either case the chervonets should by then be strong enough to hold its own unaided.The Limits of Government Control.72. It would nevertheless be a mistake to conclude that the existence of the foreign trade monopoly confers upon the Soviet Government unlimited power to control the foreign exchange value of the chervonets. The real value of a currency depends primarily on its internal purchasing power, of which its foreign exchange value is merely a reflection and not always an accurate reflection. But there is, nevertheless, a vital relation between the two, and no very great disparity between them, can long subsist. If it should happen that owing to a large unproductive emission of chervontsi or to some other cause connected, for example, with the cost of production or distribution, the internal purchasing power of the chervonets should* The foreign trade figures are shown in Table XII.
steadily fall and nominal chervonets prices rise, it might be possible for the Government, by maintaining at all costs an excess of exports, or by the aid of accumulated stocks of foreign currency, to keep the external value of the chervonets at par for a time; but, in the end, this policy would strike at the very safeguard of external parity, the favourable trade balance itself. If such a steady rise in internal chervonets prices were translated at gold parity to the foreign buyer, export prices would be driven far above the world price, export trade would be killed and the chervonets could not long survive.73. There would be two possible remedies open to the Soviet Government. The first would be to curtail imports drastically and to preserve the favourable trade balance by selling abroad at a loss, making up the deficit from revenue. This is a grievous remedy, which has already from time to time been adopted by the Soviet Government on a small scale. Its efficacy in the face of a steady, uninterrupted rise of internal nominal prices is more than doubtful. There remains the second remedy, which would be to revert to the position existing in the days of the parallel currencies, and to cut the Treasury rouble free from the chervonets and let it depreciate. The Treasury rouble would be, as the Soviet rouble was, the currency for general internal exchange purposes, while the chervonets would remain the currency for governmental and foreign exchange purposes, until the time came to issue still another Treasury currency interchangeable with it, in replacement of the old, now depreciated, Treasury currency. If this were done, the gold value of internal prices would at first undoubtedly fall and the export trade could be resumed; but the previous experiment of a double currency had such disastrous effects that the augury is not good for the ultimate success of any such remedy in the future. The fact is, and the Soviet Government are well aware of it, that the best way to guarantee the chervonets is to maintain its purchasing power by stimulating the general economic life of the country and to keep down prices by cheapening pro-duction and distribution. Chapter V will show that the lowering of prices is now-one of the chief preoccupations of the Government. &quot;We cannot fix prices now,&quot; a Soviet official recently confessed; and that being so, attention is being paid to methods less arbitrary than this, though some of them are still far removed from what the Western capitalist would regard as natural or economic.Why is the Chervonets stable?74. If, then, it be asked how the Soviet Government has been able to maintain the chervonets at par with the dollar, the reasons are three. First, because it has adhered scrupulously to its published plan and has committed none of the more obvious sins which are fatal to stability; in particular, it has not over-issued nor applied the chervonets to unproductive or fiscal ends. Secondly, because it possesses in the monopoly of foreign trade a means of controlling, wdthin limits, any natural tendency of the chervonets to fluctuate. And thirdly, because the general economic position of the country is such that nominal chervonets prices have not risen beyond the capacity of the Government, with its peculiar powers of exacting the cost and distributing the burden of its operations, to maintain an excess of exports. The future of the chervonets depends in the last resort on the general economic position of the country, by which the price level is ultimately governed, and in developing that economic life the Government is constrained by its aspirations after a stable currency and. a balanced budget to have recourse more&apos; and more to natural as opposed to arbitrary methods.75. But the financial history of the Soviet Government has been, and is still, the home of paradox. The Soviet Government has little credit abroad, yet it maintains a stable currency at par. It has repudiated its inherited obligations, it has con-fiscated property, and has displayed a cynical disregard for the welfare of the bulk of its citizens, yet the latter have confidence in the chervonets, though the Govern-ment plundered them twice over in order to establish it, and is ready to plunder them again if necessary in order to maintain it. It still plunders them in other ways. For example, while the chervonets is now at par, the State 6 per cent, gold lottery loan is at 50 per cent, discount. The explanation is simple, but eloquent of the peculiar power of the Soviet Government in economic matters. Instead of covering budget deficits wholly by the issue of currency (which is incompatible with stability) it has taken to covering them by loans. The Russian people either have no savings, or, if they have, they show no readiness to lock them up in investments; loans are therefore compulsorily placed. The 6 per cent, lottery loan was forced, so far as it could be taken up, upon the bourgeois class in non-negotiable
bonds, and what remained was issued in negotiable bonds of small denomination in&apos; part payment of wages. Shops will not accept these bonds, and the fact that they carry interest is of no attraction, for ready money is the crying need. The holders, if they are lucky, sell them on the &quot; black bourse &quot; or pledge them with the banks for 50 per cent, of their face value, and the Government redeems them at half the issue price.IV. The Budget.The History of the Soviet Budget.76. Before the introduction of the new economic policy and for about a year afterwards, there was, properly speaking, no budget at all. The country was, in fact, financed by an ever-increasing issue of paper money. Such figures as are available show that in 1918 the excess of expenditure over revenue was twice as large as the revenue itself and was wholly covered by emission; in 1919 the deficit was more than three times, in 1920 seven times, and in 1921 more than five times, as large as the revenue, the revenue being obtained almost entirely by requisition and the deficit being wholly covered by currency emission.* An unsuccessful attempt was made at the end of 1921 to frame a budget for the nine months from January to September 1922, and it was not till the financial year 1922-23 (the financial year commencing, from now onwards, in October to correspond with the agricultural year) that estimates were made with any success, and even then they consisted merely of a rough general outline prepared at the opening of the year and supplemented by more detailed plans for each successive quarter. The 1922-23 budget was the first to be placed on a gold basis, and was, in M. Sokolnikov&apos;s phrase, &quot; an orientation or trial budget.&quot; In 1923-24 estimates were prepared which proved, on the whole, surprisingly accurate, t though it should be explained that the estimates shown in Table XXIV were not those compiled at the beginning of the year, but represent a final estimate prepared when the year had already run part of its course. The 1924-25 budget is the first to include estimates for the Far Eastern territory and Trans caucasia, the first to be based on a stable currency actually in use, the first to be prepared in detail before the opening of the year, and, still more striking, the first to balance without any issue of paper currency for revenue purposes.77. The principal facts that emerge from a comparison of these three budgetst are that, while expenditure has increased since 1922-23 by 50 per cent. (1,419 to 2.021 millions!), the deficit has decreased by more than 50 per cent. (447 to 210 millions); that, while in 1922-23 the gold value of the paper roubles used for revenue purposes was 262 millions, the only issue of currency shown in 1924-25 is 80 millions, and this, being not paper but metal, is not all profit; that the receipts from taxation, direct and indirect, have increased by 60 per cent.; and that the profits from State enterprises (excluding railways, posts and telegraphs) have increased by over 100 per cent., though they still amount to only 7-5 per cent, of the revenue, and must be off-set by the subsidy shown on the other side of the sheet. It is also claimed by Soviet apologists that the proportion of the total national wealth taken by the State in the form of revenue is 30 per cent, smaller than in 1913, the respective percentages being 13 and 19. Direct a.nd indirect taxation are also said to be lighter, being now 7 roubles a head as compared with 11 roubles per head before the war.The Construction of the Budget.78. The essential characteristic of the Soviet budget is that it contains not simply a statement of receipts from taxation and of normal State expenditure, but of receipts and expenditure on account of the operations of State enterprises. For the railways and the posts and telegraphs the gross receipts are given; for the other State enterprises, such as industry, commerce, banking and the exploitation of State property, only a profit and loss account is shown, the profits on the receipts side of the budget being off-set by the subsidies shown on the expenditure side. Receipts both from taxation and from State enterprises are classed as ordinary revenue. There is also a sum set down as extraordinary revenue, which is, in fact, the deficit and is made up of receipts from loans, sales of stocks and currency issues. There is a corresponding sub-division of expenditure into ordinary and extraordinary. The normal expenses of the various departments of State, together with certain central funds for subsidies and Treasury operations, are described as ordinary expenditure.
while the subsidies to agriculture, industry, &amp;c, the sums applied to public works and electrification, the advances to municipal institutions and such calls upon the public purse as relief for famine areas are classed together as extraordinary expenditure.The Taxes.79. Taxation is both direct and indirect. The policy of the Soviet Government is to rely to an increasing degree upon direct taxation, as this form of tax can be more easily levied on class principles; but indirect taxes still have a higher yield than afreet taxes, the most productive single tax being the excise, which falls on articles of common consumption. The direct taxes are three, all of them class taxes, namely, the agricultural tax, the industrial tax and the income and property tax, of which the first has already been described in paragraph 21 above.80. The industrial tax consists of a licence or patent, the fee for which is graded according to the character and scale of each trading establishment, and of a tax on. turnover. Nationalised industries pay this tax in the same way as industries which are in private hands, the corollary to this being that the State pays cash for its purchases of goods from the nationalised industries. The other direct contribution of State industries to the State Exchequer is the due proportion of their profits; but against this must be set the subsidy from State funds appearing under the head of extraordinary expenditure.81. The income and property tax falls principally upon the private trader. It is paid by persons receiving income for personal service, e.g., officials, &amp;c, or as independent workers, or from industry, or trade, or property, or any other source not involving personal labour. Above specified limits, it is imposed at progressive rates. In 1923-24 the average annual income of the 450,000 persons who paid this tax was only 1,800 gold roubles ( 190). Traders and brokers, i.e., the &quot;nepmen,&quot; constituted 60 per cent, of the tax-payers and paid 75 per cent, of the total proceeds. The last returns show that in 1924 there were as many as 1,321 incomes of between 16,000 and 20,000 roubles a year ( 1,750 to  2,200). The property tax is shortly to be abolished and the agricultural tax is to be assimilated to the income tax, which is beginning to yield well. The effect of this change will be to strike the richer and relieve the poorer peasants.82. As regards indirect taxes: the import customs tariff is highly protective, falling more heavily on manufactured goods and luxuries than on implements and raw materials of manufacture: the export customs tariff is based on considerations of revenue and falls more heavily on raw materials than on semi-finished articles, while manufactures are exempt; the excise duty is paid on sugar, oil, salt, tobacco, tea, alcohol, matches.General Economic Bearing of the Budget.   Incidence of Taxation.83. It will be of interest to enquire what are the contributions to the State revenue of agriculture, State industry, and commerce, and what light the budget for 1924-25 throws upon the general economic position.84. Agriculture is naturally the largest contributor. The yield of the agricultural tax is nearly double the joint yield of the industrial and income taxes; the yield of the excise, which, as a general consumption tax, must be also in good measure a peasants&apos; tax, is more than double the joint yield of the customs and other duties, which are not so largely though to some extent still peasants&apos; taxes. In the matter of loans the contribution of agriculture (Peasants&apos; Loan  50 million gold roubles) is greater than that of either State industry (8 per cent. Internal Gold Loan 30 millions) or private trade (Second Lottery Loan 40 millions).85. M. Sokoinikov in his budget speech Avas at pains to argue that the tendency now is for industry to pay a larger and agriculture a smaller proportion of taxation than before. In support of this he pointed out that if local taxation is taken into account the disproportion in the yields of the direct agricultural and industrial taxes is much reduced; and that agriculture was receiving much more help from the budget than ever before. There is&apos;some truth in this, but it does not go very far. Local taxation is in the nature of rates, paid to some extent to defray the cost of necessary services received, and is of direct benefit to the industry that pays them, and not, like State taxation, a contribution to a much more distant object. Further, if it is true that the total subsidy to agriculture has, unlike the subsidy to industry, increased since 1923-24 the reason is plain, for more than half of it is required for the relief of the population in regions, Avhere, from natural causes, the harvest of 1924 was[12760J 2
scanty. The best answer to M. Sokolnikov is, however, to point out that, although there was a partial crop failure in 1924, the direct agricultural tax and the excise which is a good deal of it paid by the peasant, are each estimated to yield an increase of 50 per cent, over 1923-24, while the yield of the industrial tax, of the income and property tax and of the customs, &amp;c., which fall chiefly on industry and commerce, are estimated to yield an average increase of 20 per cent. only.86. Against this it is claimed that though the peasant has paid successively greater sums in taxation since 1922, the relation which these sums bear to his total output has fallen from 7-5 per cent, in 1922-23 to 3-2 per cent, in the present year. There can be no doubt that this is largely due to the stabilisation of the currency and to the consequent rise in the purchasing value of the peasants&apos; output, and that one effect of the currency reform has been to increase the taxable capacity of agriculture.The Profits of State Enterprises.87. It is true also that, taxation apart, State trading and industry are becoming more productive of revenue or, it might be more correct to say, less of a burden upon the State Exchequer. It is very difficult to be positive about the meaning of the figures shown, for so long as the State itself conducts industry and commerce, and shows only profit and loss accounts, it is easy for actual results to be concealed, although perhaps in the long run tendencies will not fail to reveal themselves. State trading, for example, is estimated to yield a clear contribution to the revenue of 18 million roubles, off-set, so far as can be seen, by nothing on the other side of the sheet. It is quite impossible to saj^ what relation this figure will bear to the gross profits of the foreign trade monopoly. The expenses of the establishments of the foreign trade commissariat abroad will doubtless have been deducted, and provision been made for additions to the State reserve of foreign currency out of the gross profits, before a balance is struck.88. As regards State industry, what the budget shows-apart from the fact, already noted, that it is paying 20 per cent, more in taxation than during the previous fiscal year is that while on the one hand it is to contribute 50 million gold roubles as the share of its profits falling to the public revenue, it is receiving from the public purse a subsidy of 60 millions, supplemented, no doubt, out of the general subsidies fund of 20 millions figuring as one of the items of ordinary expenditure, but not otherwise explained. Profits are much greater than ever before and the subsidy appreciably less, but there is still an adverse balance. Nationalised industries are one by one being placed on a business footing and financed by short term bank loans instead of State grants, but the profits of those that are paying do not yet balance the losses of those that are working at a loss. The oil and coal industries, for instance, no longer receive grants under the budget, but the heavy engineering-industry is still a charge on the revenue and absorbs most of the available profits of the others. The whole profit, of course, does not pass to the State Exchequer. M. Sokolnikov estimates the gross profits of State industry in the present year at 119 millions, of which only 50 millions will fall to the State. The balance of 69 millions will be applied partly to meet depreciation and partly to improve workers&apos; conditions.89. It may be surprising that in the conditions of Soviet industry as they have been described in Chapter II there should be any profits at all. There has, however, been as the next chapter will show, a slight revival in industry consequent upon the stabilisation of the currency, which may help to lessen the surprise. But even so, the results are not brilliant, nor are they regarded as such by Soviet leaders them-selves; State industry is still in the toils of inefficient production and distribution. The plain facts are that, if no account is taken of taxation, which the State has a right to receive as a first charge, industry still receives from the State more than it gives; and the balance of the &quot;so-called gross profits which is used for development purposes by such enterprises as are making a profit at all is, even on M. Sokolnikov&apos;s estimate, remarkably small, when the magnitude of the enterprises themselves is taken into consideration. It can, nevertheless, be claimed for the Soviet system, with some justice, that, although it has so far been unable to produce and distribute cheaply, it&apos; is by its nature able to regard industry as one unit, and to spread the profits and loss of its enterprises over industry as a whole. By supporting the heavy engineering industry, which cannot yet make a profit, with contributions from the textile industry, which can, it is at one and the same time securing the production of articles necessary to the national economy and maintaining the rate of wages in a depressed industry.
The Prospects.90. M. Sokolnikov does not regard the prospects of obtaining the estimated revenue as very hopeful. The doubtful factors are agriculture and transport. There has been one poor harvest and there are now signs of another, which will not pre-dispose the peasant to pay taxes. The railways are to pay their way without a State grant, but it is not clear whether any adequate provision has been made for meeting depreciation of stock and permanent way. As, however, they have no capital charge to meet ^they were taken over without compensation, and loans were repudiated they should be able to make provision for wastage out of current receipts, and M. Sokolnikov says that this is to be done, although the Commissariat of Ways and Communications have their doubts about it. But the estimated receipts are 780 millions, that is, about 30 per cent, higher than last year&apos;s actual receipts, and will require a proportionate increase in the product of the national economy if they are to be realised.V. The Present Problem.The Results of the Currency Reform.91. The completion of the currency reform by the issue, in the spring of 1924, of a Treasury currency of small denomination interchangeable at par with the chervonets gave an immediate stimulus to internal trade. But its solicitude for the stability of its currency and the balancing of its budget set bounds to the liberty of the Soviet Government to deal with the still existing problem in the old adventurous way, and led it to seek reductions in the costs of production and distribution by more natural methods than before, namely, by increasing the. productivity of labour and by readmitting private capital into commerce and industry. These are the governing conditions in the present problem, which will now be considered.92. The results of the disappearance of the Soviet rouble were soon evident. The monthly turnover on the Moscow commodity market, as well as on the group of thirty-five provincial markets for which statistics are available, Avas doubled between April and October 1924.* The peasants, impoverished as they were, had at last some stable purchasing medium in hand and commenced to buy. Stocks of manufactured goods of general consumption were soon exhausted, and industry proved unable to keep pace with the demand. It was reported in the autumn of 1924 that many branches, textiles in particular, had sold their output for months in advance. It is true that the textile industry, almost alone, benefited from the revived demand, and that there have recently been signs that the demand itself is beginning to decline, but, nevertheless, the peasants&apos; purchasing power had once more become effective. What has been described in Chapter II as the primary economic problem Avas therefore on the way to solution, and the prospects were more favourable than at any time since the revolution. It would be a mistake to underrate the significance of this achievement, but it would be equally a mistake to imagine that it Avas any more than a first, though indeed a most important, step. How much remained, and still remains, to do, ic will be the purpose of the following paragraphs to show.IV;j:i&apos;i if;..; V&quot;&apos;;,.! j   ::\    !   :&apos;       ; ; &apos;.&apos;.       ; &apos;&quot;i &apos; &apos; &apos;     1The Present Problem Analysed.93. The following is an analysis of the present economic situation : The Conditions of a Stable Currency. (i.) The stability of the currency depends in varying degrees on an excess of exports, a budget balanced without further issue of currency, the maintenance of its own internal purchasing power and, generally, on the economic health of the community.(ii.) An excess of exports depends principally on the cheap and plentiful production of grain by the peasant and of timber and oil by the State trusts controlling these materials. In 1924 part of the grain exported Avas sold at a loss, for the enormous transport and administrative expenses added to the high initial cost had raised the price above the world level. Timber and oil similarly can only continue to be sold abroad at a profit if costs of production and transport are kept Ioav in relation to prices ruling abroad, that is to say, if the efficiency of labour and. management is stimulated.* See Table XIII.
(iii.) The balancing of the budget demands that the present expectation of a 30 per cent, increase in national productivity shall be fulfilled, and depends in particular upon revenue from agriculture, revenue from industry, and railway receipts, themselves a gauge of the general commercial turnover.(iy.) The stability of the internal purchasing power of the chervonets necessitates reductions in selling prices, more especially of manufactured goods; and such reduction can only be made possible by dismissing unproductive staff, bv increasing the productivity of. labour, and by introducing efficient methods of management.(v.) The general economic health of the community depends primarily on an active interchange of the products of industry and agriculture, the first condition for which is a good harvest.Grain Prices.(vi.) The harvest of 1924 was moderate, and. there is no surplus for export. The high price of grain has enabled the peasants in the more productive areas to buy, and the demand for some articles of manufacture actually exceeds the supply, though the total volume of trade remains unsatisfactory. But at the same time, this increased price of grain, by raising the cost of feeding the urban workers, will entail the payment of higher wages and an increase in the cost of production in industry. An attempt was made towards the end of 1924 to limit grain prices which did not wholly succeed. The Soviet Government is recognising and admitting that the more its enterprises are placed on an economic basis the less easy it is to control industrial prices by administrative means. Still less can grain prices be fixed. The peasant is in a strong position and can hold up the one indispensable commodity, and there is no likelihood of a return to the policy of requisition that precipitated the crisis of 1921. The alternative plan for the stabilisation of grain prices is the accumulation of a reserve fund of grain by which to control the market. The scantiness of the last harvest prevented the collection of such a reserve, and it is proposed now to purchase a reserve from abroad. This will reduce the balance of exports.(vii.) If the price of grain were reduced, the peasant would be less able and willing to pay his tax, and his consumption of manufactured articles would fall. This would be detrimental both to the finances of the State and to the demand for industrial products, unless industry could be brought to produce more cheaply. If the price of grain remains high, wages and costs of production will rise. In either case, therefore, it is of importance that the costs of production should be reduced, whether in the light industries, where the public is the chief customer, or in the heavy industries, where the State not only produces but is also the principal purchaser.Costs of Production: Productivity of Labour. (viii.) If this is to be done without a reduction of wages which is to be avoided, for the industrial worker is the true proletarian, the backbone of the revolution  it can best be done by the four normal capitalist methods of increasing the production per head with perhaps consequent reduction of staff; improving the management; improving the technical equipment of the factories; and reducing the margin between factory and consumers prices, i.e., the cost of distribution. These are the methods which are now being adopted. Piecework and overtime are repugnant to the Communist conscience, no less than to British trade unionism, though Lenin himself advocated them with all the irony at his command. Wages are on the average too high for the amount of work done, and the trade unions have decided, much to the surprise of the British trade union delegation, that in the interests of increased productivity a system of payment by results should be inaugurated throughout the Union. The workers complain that they will be thrown out of employment; the reply is that labour policy must be directed in the interest of the whole working class of the Union, and not of individual categories of labour. Thus do the trade unions do the bidding of the Workers&apos; Government, and thus does the Workers&apos; Government fulfil its educative and repressive mission. As Mr. Fred Bramley remarked: &quot;Everything is upside down here. No British trade union leader could go on a platform and advocate what the Russian trade unions are carrying through here.&quot; More efficient management will be difficult to secure so long as places are reserved for good Communists, both as a reward for their services and as a means of supervising the non-party experts.    The improvement of the
technical equipment of the factories involves the question of capital and will be treated later (paragraph (xi)). The reduction of the margin between wholesale and retail prices raises the question of the private trader.Cost of Distribution: The Private Trader and the Co-operatives. (ix.) Now, just as the purpose of the foreign trade monopoly is not only to provide a source of revenue for the Government, and to enable the Government to regulate the character and quantity of imports and exports in what it conceives to be the best interests of the State, and incidentally to allow the Government to control the foreign exchange market, but also to surround the country with a Chinese wall in order to ensure that the State shall be the sole intermediary between its citizens and the hostile and contaminating capitalist abroad, so, also, it is the policy of the Government in internal trade to surround the inert but latently hostile peasant mass with a wall segregating it so far as possible from the capitalist private trader within the country. The private trader cannot easily be dispensed with in the complicated retail trade of the towns, and can, if necessary, be easily crushed there; but the private trader, competing with and under or over-bidding the Government for the custom of the peasant, is a political and economic danger. That the Govern-ment should be the principal buyer of grain is comparatively easy of attainment, though even here the wall has in places been breached; but, as seller, the private trader, with his greater flexibility, can easily compete with State or co-operative institutions. In fact, by the spring of 1924, the private trader conducted 83 per cent, of the retail and 64 per cent, of the wholesale or wholesale-retail trade of the country. It was then decided to combat this ominous result of the New Economic Policy by imposing heavy taxation upon the private trader, by refusing him credit at the banks or goods from State institutions, by reintroducing a general policy of price control, and by arresting and exiling him. The effects of this action were a reduction of revenue, and a slackening of the flow of goods, detrimental both to the peasant and to industry. In order to restore a flow of goods it was decided to encourage the co-operative societies. This has not been very successful. The co-operatives have heavy overhead charges and require goods on credit from the trusts; their delay, in meeting their engagements at due date ties up the working capital of the trusts, who are consequently unable to pay wages or taxes punctually; the trusts have difficulty in getting credits from the State Bank, for advances are strictly limited to productive purposes lest the position of the chervonets should be shaken; they find it equally difficult to get subsidies from the Government, for there is now a budget to balance and no unstable currency to play with. Once again the difficulty of the trusts is lack of capital, for such capital as they have is frozen up in the channels of the distributing agencies.&quot; Goods intervention.&quot; ^ -(x.) In the meantime the peasant is not getting his goods as cheaply and plentifully through the co-operatives as he did through the private trader, and is becoming discontented, notwithstanding that grain prices are high. The remedy known as &quot; goods intervention,&quot; rejected with ignominy a year ago as contrary to the principles of the State plan, is now about to be applied, i.e., the purchase abroad and distribution to the peasant at prices within his reach of goods essential to him, irrespective of whether they can be produced at home or not. Only the most pressing necessity to conciliate the peasants who, as M. Zinoviev has recently said, are more dangerous than a hundred Kolchaks can have dictated this policy, which is likely to cost two or three million pounds in cash or on onerous credit terms, and which will disturb the trade balance and imperil the stability of the chervonets. On the other hand, the State trusts and distributing agencies may be spurred to new efforts to lower consumers&apos; prices.Lack of Industrial Capital. (xi.) The trusts have, however, as already noted above, their own difficulties in the matter of capital. They require an increase of fixed capital for purposes of equipment and of working capital for current business. They are the victims of a money famine, due primarily to the fact that the Government has no longer an unstable currency by which to transfer to the people at large the whole burden of inefficiency in manufacture and distribution. The trusts and co-operatives have now to bear their own burdens. When the trusts were created, they took over the factories as they stood and their capital was, by their statutes,
divided into basic capital, which, in theory, they could not touch, and working-capital, at their free disposal. Provision was made in the statutes for allocation from gross profits of certain sums to reserve capital fund, depreciation fund, &amp;c. The basic capital is further protected by the fact that last year the Government, in need of revenue, ordered that 60 per cent, of such capital should be invested in the 8 per cent, gold internal loan, for which there is a narrow market. None the less, when they found themselves precluded from disposing of their goods to private traders, and when their credits to the co-operatives froze, some trusts raided their deprecia-tion funds for current purposes. How, then, are the trusts to find capital for renewals and extensions of plant, upon which any increase of productivity will to some extent depend 1 The solution now proposed is to permit private capital to participate once again in wholesale distribution so that the private trader, who pays higher prices and pays them more quickly than the co-operatives, will free the working capital of the trusts from the unnatural role of financing distribution, and restore it to its natural function. The wheels of industry once more freely revolving, the trusts will be expected to build up their own reserve for improvements. Meanwhile the co-operatives will still continue to be encouraged, but only on condition that they meet their obligations at due date.General Aspect of the Problem and its Solution.94. This, in outline, is the present problem and the proposed solution. It is, in its purely economic aspect, * no worse than the problems which the Soviet Govern-ment has encountered time after time in its history. Its peculiar character lies in the restriction of the Government&apos;s power of manoeuvre in the presence of a stable currency and of a budget which is expected to balance, and in the fact that State enterprises are, in consequence, being more and more insistently invited to pay their own way. The desiderata are a good harvest, which does not depend upon man alone, and cheaper production and distribution, which do. Each j^ear brings its own problem, according as the harvest is good or bad and according as grain prices are low or high.Some of the remedies proposed are of the old arbitrary kind; some are of the new order. The accumulation of a reserve fund of a commodity for the control of the price of that commodity is a Socialist device practised before the war by the Imperial Government. Payment of wages by results is a business-like plan, but, in introducing it, the Soviet Government is more capitalist than the capitalists. To sell abroad at a loss in order to gain a countervailing advantage elsewhere is a trick well known to capitalists. &quot; Goods intervention &quot; is a form of relief to a productive industry, agriculture, and is only objectionable to Communists because it benefits the peasant at the expense of the urban worker. To insist that undertakings shall pay their way is plain common-sense, though it insults the Marxist conscience. To readmit the private trader is to recognise that there are limits to the efficacy of fixing prices and of subsidising cumbrous agencies like the co-operatives. Some of the remedies are repugnant to the Communist, some to the capitalist of the West, but they are not of their nature necessarily uneconomic, though they may be misapplied or for other reasons fail.95. If they fail, there is another remedy, already contemplated, for developing both the revenue and production of the country, namely, the grant of concessions on a royalty basis to foreign capitalists for the exploitation of mineral deposits. M. Dzerzhinski, president of the Supreme Council of National Economy, has recently advocated this policy, and declared it to be preferable to the raising of a foreign loan. Poreign capitalists will require very generous terms in the highly speculative venture which a bargain with the Soviet Government, in view both of its past record and of its general political principles, must of necessity be. The Communist shudders at the thought of exploitation by big business. But if the need is pressing enough, the bargain will be struck, and the Soviet Government will give its people the best account it can of it. So long as the Soviet Government has this asset in hand it is not at the end of its tether. If it concedes it to the foreign capitalist it may be renouncing as indeed it has done before the Communist society once thought to be at hand, but it need not in any way be jeopardising the existence of the &quot; Workers&apos; Republic,&quot; and this, for the moment, is all that matters.* There is a political aspect of the relations between the Government and the peasants which has of late been causing the former some anxiety, but into which it is hardly within the province of the present memorandum to enter,
VI. Comment.96. The facts of Soviet economic history have been variously interpreted. They would appear, on the face of it, to represent a steady advance in reconstruction. This is how the British Trade Union delegation regard them, and this indeed is, in the broadest sense, their meaning. On the other hand, it is said by persons less well disposed that progress would have been much more rapid under any other than a Communist or quasi-Communist system; or that, whatever the figures may say, the national wealth is not increasing but decreasing, and that the country is in fact still living on the capital accumulated before the revolution; or finally that, even if it is true that the Government is paying its way and increasing the productivity of the country, it only does so by combined spoliation, starvation and slave-driving.The Two Guiding Considerations.96a. These adverse views deserve examination, but before proceeding to discuss them it would be well to observe that Soviet economic progress cannot be properly estimated unless two important facts are borne in mind. These are : first, that progress (if any) has been achieved, not simply by evolutionary processes, but by a combination of sound business method and arbitrary expedient, whichever best suited the needs of the moment; and secondly, that economic progress to the Communist mind has a political connotation unknown to&apos; the West, which gives rise to widely divergent appreciations both of the ideal to be pursued and of the value of the progress made, according as they are viewed from the Communist or the non-Communist position.The Soviet Method.97. The foregoing chapters have provided numerous examples of the Soviet method : Thus, the history of the chervonets illustrates how the Soviet Government can combine sound finance with spoliation; the commentary on the budget in Chapter V shows that some of the nationalised industries are being supported partly out of the profits of those that are paying their way, and partly out of the general revenue; similarly, part of the grain export in 1923-24 was conducted at a loss in order to maintain an active trade balance, upon which the stability of the still sensitive chervonets depended; and it has also been reported that orders were recently placed with State factories for a number of locomotives which the Commissariat of Communications did not require and could not pay for, in order that engineering works might be kept running. So also, the &quot; scissors crisis &quot; itself was solved partly by natural, partly by arbitrary measures. The crux of the problem was that industry was stimulated by the new chervonets credits from the bank, while the peasant was losing purchasing power daily, having no medium of exchange except the rapidly falling rouble. The resulting stalemate was resolved by an arbitrary act and by a natural process. Industrial prices were in October 1923 reduced by a stroke of the pen by an average of 25 per cent., and grain prices were raised by the resumption of export, although there was none too much grain in the country and export had to be conducted for some time at a loss. On the other hand, a campaign was started to increase the productivity of labour and to reduce overhead charges by concentrating on the better-equipped factories; and the completion of the currency reform at last brought a stable currency into the hands of the peasants and enabled them to buy in the industrial market.The Communist Purpose.98. The second point has already been touched on in paragraph 13; but its meaning in relation to the Soviet economic situation is, more explicitly stated, this : that the Workers&apos; Government has been ordained to an educative and, if necessary, repressive mission, and is the infallible guide of the community; that&apos; though the pursuit of social wealth for the community as a whole is indubitably a legitimate and admirable aim, yet the real value of that wealth lies perhaps less in its mere quantity than in its distribution, and perhaps less in its distribution than in the social and political circumstances attending its acquisition; and that the present wealth of the Workers&apos; Republic, small as it is, may be more valuable in the absolute sense than a greater volume acquired by methods more efficient, perhaps, but more tainted with capitalism. What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul? &quot; The fundamental aim of the Soviet State,&quot; said M. Dzerzhinski in a recent speech, &quot; is the organisation of society on a basis that will exclude entirely the possibility of
exploitation .... The organisation of industry and its progress is of supreme importance, not as an end in itself, but because it is the necessary basis for the workers&apos; and peasants&apos; State.&quot; Capitalist relations may be admitted as a. concession to expediency, for Communism is not yet triumphant; but the Workers&apos; Government must, for the defence of its faith no less than for the preservation of its very existence determine the limits of concession. The policy of &quot; no surrender &quot; may entail misery for the population, Communist as well as non-Communist. It does not matter. The non-Communist suffers because it is his portion to suffer; the Communist should suffer with joy for the cause that is ultimately to prevail. What, under capitalism, would be servitude is, under the Workers&apos; Government, the badge of service.99. Since the great surrender of 1921 the fixing of the limits of concession in the presence of the developing economic life of the country has not ceased to be a matter of contention in the bosom of the Communist party. The ebb and flow of the battle are marked, for instance, by the acceptance and subsequent rejection of what we should call common-sense schemes, like the Urquhart Concession, or by the alternate encouragement and suppression of the private trader, who is a useful and productive element, but a threat to the safety and an insult to the conscience of the Workers&apos; Republic. The hand of the purer Communists may be seen in the opposition lately overcome to thy introduction of payment by results, and in the constant political supervision, in the interests of Communist orthodoxy, of the details of every State enterprise. It seems in fact to be the practice of the Soviet Government, whether or not it is its conscious policy, to have sufficient recourse to non-Communist method in order just to make progress and no more. If under capitalist stimulus rapid growths appear they are pruned back lest they should pass beyond control, and such stimulus is reduced to the minimum : the State, like the apple tree, will bear the sweetest fruit when it is hard put to it even to live. To change the metaphor; the Soviet Government would rather build slowly provided that it can build surely. &apos;&quot;&apos; A poor drab Russia, yes,&quot; said M. Zinoviev, &quot; but a Russia that is our own.&quot;The Three Objections: Communism Inefficient.99a. It is necessarynow to return to the adverse criticisms cited in paragraph 96. The first of these is that progress would have been more rapid under a non-Communist regime. This is undeniable, but it begs the question. Foreign trade and industry are undoubtedly overburdened with a vast, complex, inefficient and extravagant State machinery which outweighs any advantage gained by the sub-jection of both to an ordered plan. But, as has already been shown, what the Workers&apos; Government values is not progress (or efficiency) in itself, but progress in certain conditions, the first of these conditions being the preservation of the principles of the Workers&apos; Republic in so far as they are compatible with progress at all. Some of its principles have been found incompatible with progress in present circumstances and have been temporarily abandoned in the interests of self-preservation-tion; it is possible that the same fate will overtake thern all, but not yet.The Country Living on its Capital.100. It is also alleged that the wealth of the country is shrinking rather than expanding, whatever the figures may say, and that the country is still living on accumulated capital.  The argument is as follows i &quot; The Soviet Government took over the national economy wasted by war, it is true, but free of all liability; the national wealth was further consumed by civil war, by Bolshevik maladministration, and later by the famine; since the famine the Soviet Government has reorganised the economic system on State capitalist lines, but, notwithstanding that the system is entirely free from capital liability and is exploiting only the best equipped and most profitable means of production, it is not even making good the current capital depreciation, and will inevitably exhaust its resources in the long run.&quot;In industry, this has in the past undoubtedly been true, though the turning-point seems already to have been reached. In agriculture it is not true. Agricultural production, which is less dependent than manufacture upon expensive equipment, began to increase immediately after the famine, in spite of a dire shortage of implements and stock, and is steadily rising. Here the figures have a clear meaning. It is, on the whole, probable therefore that the total national wealth, actual and potential, is now on the up-grade.   The growing taxable capacity of the country,
illustrated in the case of the peasant both by an increased yield from taxation and a-falling proportion of tax to output, bears witness to this.101. Another.factor which has some little bearing here is the State gold reserve-In 1914 the State bank held a gold reserve of 1,600 million roubles, and the gold coinage in circulation amounted to nearly 500 million roubles, giving a total of 2,100 millions. Almost all the State gold reserve, including probably also the Roumanian treasure taken over by the Imperial Government during the German occupation of Roumania, is believed to have been exhausted by the end of 1921. M. Sokolnikov recently declared that since 1922 the State had accumulated by its own efforts 1,000 million roubles. This presumably is partly gold and partly foreign bank-notes, but the proportion is unknown, nor is it quite clear that the assets to which he refers are all as tangible as gold and foreign currency. What is certain is that the State bank holds as cover for its bank-notes about 145 million roubles in gold, 10 million in platinum and 100 million in foreign bank-notes, a total of 255 millions. The foreign currency has been acquired by financial or commercial operations, the gold either gradually brought in from circulation or drawn from the mines. The fact that the Soviet Government has now to purchase gold* on the New York market indicates that the limits of collection from the population have been reached, that the output of the mines is unequal to the demand, and that necessary reserves must be built up by purchase from abroad out of the profits of State trade; but it would also give one to believe that the gold actually accumulated in the hands of the State or its organs is not likely to be very much in excess of the sum actually shown by the State bank as cover for the chervonets issue, that is to say,. 145 million roubles.102. It is also significant that, even in its direst need, the Soviet Government was not driven to sell the priceless art collections which Sir Martin Conway tells us are being so carefully tended, and that the Crown jewels, in spite of all reports to the contrary, are believed to be still intact. These are not the marks of a bankrupt Government.Oppression, Spoliation and Slavery.103. There remains the charge that, although the Government may be paying its way, it does so only by oppression, spoliation and slavery. If this means that open requisition and confiscation are still the order of the day, it is not supported by facts; in any other sense it is substantially true. Political liberties do not exist, as is well known, and the population is at the mercy of administrative action, and of a propaganda, skilful, persistent and unsleeping, both of them designed to perpetuate the principles of the revolution. Given the existence of this regime of repression, which is part of the Marxian plan, there are some few compensatory factors which appeal with special force to those who, like the British Trade Union Delegation,, seek evidence that the workers are well cared for in a society where the workers are organised as the ruling class. Workers&apos; insurance is, by all accounts, ably organised; amusements, rest-houses and holiday resorts are placed at the disposal of the workers at cheap rates; workers&apos; clubs are set up in every institution, and there the proletarians gather to discuss the affairs of the republic and study the charts and statistics freely supplied by an active and benevolent Government; the sentiment of common work for a common purpose among the workers who are Communists, and also among those on the fringe of the party, is highly developed; and even the peasant, whose departure for military service under the Empire brought mourning&quot; to his family, now, it has been said, sets off for the Red army with a smile on his face.104.&quot; Economic oppression there has always been, though latterly it has been disguised. After confiscation had been abandoned as a policy, spoliation by currency depreciation and robbery by forced loans were still practised. The former has now in its turn been abandoned, but taxation by forced loans still remains, and about.  12,000,000 are to be raised in this way in the present year. Most of the burden of depreciation fell upon the peasant, but even the urban worker, in whose interest as the true proletarian the State is ultimately organised, receives only 70 per cent, of the pre-war wage, and is now, in the interests of the State, being reduced again to the status of a wage slave, that is to say, being told to stand upon his own feet. The best that can be said of his condition is that he enjoys a social status unknown m any other country, and, if he is a Communist, has his basic wage supplemented by benefits conferred upon him in virtue of his proletarian character.  But much of this* About  2,000,000 worth was purchased at the end of 1924. [12760] f
best is merely theoretic. Wages are often in arrears, and are liable to arbitrary deductions at source for party purposes, and they are partly paid in certificates and vouchers, for which it is not always easy to find acceptance. * Except for Communists there is little security of employment, arid unemployment benefit is almost non-existent. The few hundred thousand of Communist workmen may, indeed, be the spoilt darlings of the revolution, but to the bulk of the urban workmen the privileges of the ruling class have in a physical sense been very dearly bought.105. None the less, the die is still, economically, loaded against the peasant. Agriculture, which is the basis of all wealth in Russia, which is reviving almost entirely of its own energy, and the production of which only a natural cataclysm like the famine of 1921 or the most incredible stupidity, like the stupidity of 1918-20, can destroy, is producing relatively more and receiving for its products relatively-less than in pre-war days. It is paying for the administrative machinery by which industry and commerce are burdened, and making good to the urban worker to some extent the loss which the inefficient methods inseparable from Communist organisation would otherwise lay upon him. The only limit to the policy of making the peasant pay is imposed by the knowledge that he cannot both pay and buy, and that, unless he can buy, the towns cannot live.A Misapprehension.106. The foregoing paragraphs have indicated that, absolutely considered, the balance of Soviet economic achievement, though small, is most probably on the right side, and they have suggested that in estimating the value of that achievement it is necessary to regard it in relation to Communist method and purpose. It is still possible, nevertheless, to be under some misapprehension as to the meaning of this success, such as it is, for there are opinions commonly held on the subject which would seem to require qualification. One is to exaggerate the difficulties with which the Soviet Government has had to contend in putting his house in order. Another is to conclude that the Soviet regime is doomed to final collapse because the measures adopted appear to conflict with commonly accepted economic teaching.107. The difficulties of the Soviet Government are insisted upon by friend and foe alike. To the former, they are a consequence of the ghastly heritage bequeathed by Tsardom and the world-war. To the latter, they flow from the perversities of the Communist creed itself. Both views are well founded on fact, and for other reasons also there is ample excuse for holding them. If the difficulties of the Soviet Government appear more formidable and the economic situation of the Union more desperate than the facts upon a dispassionate consideration would seem to warrant, this must be largely ascribed to the habit of the Soviet Government of washing its dirty linen in public. Each crisis, as it develops, is discussed and analysed and exploited in the Soviet press with the object, clearly enough, of rousing the party at large to the seriousness of it, so that they may gird up their loins to meet it and be prepared for the new surrender which the solution may require. The Western press can hardly be blamed for reproducing these wrangles and con-confessions with the remark that surely this time the end is in sight. And the solutions themselves are often so alien to the normal custom of the West that their adoption is regarded time after time as the last throw of a Government in extremis.108. Yet the fact that each succeeding crisis, as it has arisen, has been duly solved and has passed away leaving the national economy no weaker and sometimes evert stronger than before, suggests that there must be resident, either in the Soviet practice itself or in the material in which it works, some element that resists disintegration and defies collapse. If this is so, then it would be much more to the point to emphasise the advantages enjoyed by the Soviet Government than to dilate on the difficulties with which it has been confronted. It is hardly possible nor is it necessary to believe that this element is to be found in the socialistic organisation of commerce and industry or in the Communist idea that inspires it; for the peasant furnishes all the explanation that can fairly be required. Numerically, productively and fiscally the peasant is the predominant factor in the Union, and all that he asks in order to support the whole body politic is to be left alone. This the Bolsheviks have in the end by bitter experience learnt to do, and this, reduced to its simplest terms, is the extent of their economic achievement. Politically, they have made themselves masters of the country, and created an administration whose authority is unchallenged from the Dniester to Kamchatka. Economically, what they have chiefly done and it is ail they have needed to do  is to permit the peasant to till the soil.   If they do not do this, there is nothing that
can save them, as the crisis of 1921 plainly showed. If they do this, it really does not very much matter what else they do in the commercial and industrial fields, for their base is secure. Upon this political and this economic foundation the whole structure rests. The peasant, once free to produce and dispose of his grain, can supply the essential means of subsistence both for himself and the small urban minority, at a meagre ration it is true, but one sufficient to sustain life, and in a good year he can supply a small surplus for export. Upon this firmest of founda-tions and by the exercise of its unchallenged authority the Government has raised a costty organisation to conduct a relatively feeble industrial and commercial activity. For a time it supported the superstructure out of the proceeds of a falling currency, largely drawn from the peasant; but when this device began to defeat its own ends, a new stable currency was introduced, and State industry amd commerce began to be put on a business footing and expected to pay their wray, as the peasant pays his. National wealth is now, for the first time, no longer falling but, perhaps, slowly rising, and in the absence of some fresh natural or political catastrophe should continue to do so. To those who insist on the undoubted difficulties, this may seem much to have achieved. To others it may seem surprisingly little. But the emotion which such a situation if duly appreciated should surely evoke is not surprise at all, but rather delight or disgust (according to taste) that the first Workers&apos; Govern-ment of the world should have fallen upon a country where, provided that it does not commit the unforgivable sin of rousing the peasant, it can, within limits, play its little games and conduct its little experiments with trade and industry without bringing the economic fabric or the daily bread of the people into jeopardy. The Workers&apos; Government has been highly fortunate, and its good fortune lies principally in this, that the small proportion borne by the field in which it may interfere with impunity to the field in which interference spells ruin, renders its preservation almost automatic. The proletarian urban worker may indeed be the darling of the revolution, but the capitalist peasant is, strange as it may seem, its preserver.W. STRANG.February 27, 1925.
APPENDIX.[The figures shown below are all drawn ultimately from Soviet sources. They are of varying reliability. The currency returns, for example, are probably accurate. The returns of total national, agricultural and industrial output must, on the other hand, be rough estimates only. Most of the others lie between these two extremes. They are not entirely trustworthy nor are they of necessity deliberately false. They are probably fair approximations. There are, for instance, numerous versions of the budget, all slightly different and no two versions of the foreign trade statistics ever agree; but. the differences are not usually material. Further, it is not always easy to discover what is and what is not included in any particular return. Their general effect, however, provided that they are considered, not absolutely ,,..but in relation to the system of which they are a record, and not as isolated facts but as general tendencies, is probably not remote from the truth. It has not been easy to isolate and compile them. The statistics most easily accessible to foreign readers are naturally presented with propagandist intent, and never tell the full story, nor always the same story. And of statistics in the original, the mass is enormous. The Soviet Government, true to its materialistic character, reduces every aspect of its economic life to tables and diagrams. In the words of an acute Swedish observer : &quot; The machine guns of the revolution have given place to typewriters.&quot;]Contents.PageTable I.
