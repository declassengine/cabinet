THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT. SECRETCP. 200 (25) . iCABINET. 4Trade Outlook.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate to my colleagues another monthly review of trade prospects by the Board of Trade Advisory Council. It is not more hopeful than its predecessor.    Here and there prospects are slightly better or slightly worse, but taken as a whole I cannot pretend that the outlook is any brighter. The picture given by members of the Council of the general situation in their respective industries Is supported by the evidence put before me by individual firms.     I am reluctantly forced to the conclusion that unless someaunforeseen improvement takes place, the Government will have to choose between affording some measure of direct financial assistance to certain of the most depressed industries, or facing an even worse position in shipbuilding, iron and steel, engineering and coal than exists to-day.P * C o -L.5.4.25.

ENGINEER I NO.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR said that he had Just returned from Belgium, where he founcl all the steel works in distress. They spoke of our competition much as we do of theirs.    They had some orders, but at low prices;    and these were running off rapidly, and not much new business was coming forward.It seemed probable that world demand for iron and steel products generally was on the down grade, and he considered that we could not keep    up    a big volume of world-trade, such as would make possible full-time operation of industrial plants, with Its resultant economies at to-day&apos;s level of prices: it was a necessary preliminary that costs of pro-duction and selling prices should be reduced.    The present high level of prices resulted In hand-to-mouth buying, with consequent spasmodic recoveries and relapses in the trade.The Sheffield steel and engineering tool trade remained in much the same situation as a month previously.    The section concerned with shipbuilding showed some falling off.    The Japanese trade could only be described a3 miserable.   The Canadian trade had, however, improved greatly this month: last month it had practically been non-existent.In France the position seemed hopeless for us.   A friend of his there had shown him certain quotations for goods required and it appeared that even when allowance had been made for the superior quality of the British goods, the French customers were looking for a price in the neighbourhood of twenty francs, whereas his own firm could only supply at thirty-seven francs.    It might be asked, why French costs do not go up proportionately with the depreciation of the franc?   As to this, It was his opinion that the French post of living was at present based on a franc valued at something like 65 to the   Instead of 90: this was made possible by the fact that they produce much of their food requirements themselves.It was a serious feature that the French were now attacking the Belgian market, which we had so far retained, with low-priced quotations for steel and tools.    The capacity of their industry was quite sufficient to enable them to do this business.It was true that their motor and luxury trades showed some falling off, and were not happy, but even so their situation was better than that   of the corresponding trades here.As regards the question of German import licences, he had had experience   of a case where he could have secured a German order at lower prices than those of foreign competitors, but had lost the business through the German Government refusing an Import licence.    It was to be hoped that the provisions of the Treaty on this subject could quickly be brought into operation.COLONEL ARMSTRONG   said that in engineering there had been a hope of better&quot;things, but numbers of orders were now
6 0 engineering.  (Contd).held up. owing probably to the general depressed condition of trade. Prospective customers were not going ahead with their schemes.He wished to endorse the remarks of Colonel Willey in regard to the supply of credit.   Credits of long term, such as one or two years, were more essential to the heavy trades than to the consumable trades, - the latter generally requiring only credit of the order of three to six months, which could generally be arranged without much difficulty with the banks.The President enquired whether the engineering   industry was availing itself of credit insurance or Export Credits; Colonel Armstrong said he thought it was doing so to a certain extent.   Replying to a question by Mr, Samuel, he thought that Insurance of bad debts would be of assistance.   Anything that would help to release unliquidated Bills would be of value to , the industry.IRON AND STEEL.MR, BAKER said that the situation of the iron and steel industry was still not good.   The number of blast furnaces in Operation remained as last month.    Press reports stated that continental competition was now weaker, owing to the Belgian works being full up with orders.A works at Bilston was now being dismantled with, the result that 500 men were thrown out of employment    and 700 men had been suspended in the Bessemer department of another works.MR. DORMAN had again to   -make a cheerless report about the heavy iron and&quot;steel trade.   The production of pig Iron was down to 534,100 tons in February, as compared with 574,500 for January, and a monthly average of 609,900 tons in   1924. The production of iron In 1924 was 29$ less than in 1913, and even lower than in 1880,The production of steel in February (646,400 tons) though higher than in January (605,100 tons) was below the monthly average for 1924 (685,100 tons).   The output so far this year was well below 1924.Imports of iron and steel in February were higher, at 234.,900 tons, as   against a monthly average of 202,434 in 1924;   while&quot; exports were down, being under 298,800 tons in February, as against 325,400 tons in January, and a monthly average of 321,088 in 1924.Several     furnaces were going out of blast on the North East Coast.   Two had been blown in, on hematite;   but six would probably go out during the next ten days, (four on hematite and two on basis steel-works&apos;  iron).It was, however, a gratifying feature that where plant could be kept in operation, the output per unit was better than had ever been obtained;   his own firm&apos;s works were breaking records in this respect.
CONFIDENTIAL. IRON AND STEEL. (Contd).Trade in galvanised and black sheets was quiet, as also in wire:    orders were getting difficult to obtain, though they had been better.    This seemed to be ascribable to a simple slacken-ing off of demand, and not to any particular new competition. No short time, however, was yet being worked in the galvanised or black sheet trade.Continental prices for billets and sheet bars had stiffened a little, as a result of exchange fluctuations.    Contrary to the experience of some other trades, the steel industry had found that, whenever the franc dropped, French quotations went up,SHIPBUILDING.COLONEL LITHGOW said that there was little fresh to report as regards shipbuilding.    Our costs of production generally, in this country, seemed to be on a thoroughly unhealthy basis.   There was, so to speak, no buying for investment, but only from hand to mouth; and this, he was convinced, was due to our present price level being a wrong one. On the other hand, at the prices quoted by the Germans,ships could be made to pay.    German costs seemed to be about two-thirds of our own, and we should have to meet this before we could get back our trade.    Our recent experience went to show that the pre-war level, or thereabouts, was the only one on which we could do business, and everyone ought to get back to it.He had been asked by shipbuilders to refer to the operations of the Trade Facilities Committee, about which there appeared to be a good deal of misunderstanding.    Orders were often received by shipbuilders subject to the Trade Facilities Committee&apos;s approval of schemes being received.   Recently many of the   reasons given for rejecting schemes seem-M to be hard to understand, and it appeared to be the inference that it must be the Committee&apos;s policy to restrict the giving of facilities for shipbuilding.The President said that the Trade Facilities Committee was, under Statute,  independent in its judgment.    There had been a good deal of criticism of the giving of assistance under the Act for shipbuilding, since it was thought likely to produce unhealthy and artificial conditions.    The rule now being followed was that where a foreign shipowner made an application, a guarantee wouldnot be given if without it, the order for the ship would not be placed   at all; but if it seemed reasonably clear that the ship would be built in any case, abroad,  if not here, a guarantee might be granted.Colonel Llthgow said that in some of the cases he had in mind British ship-owners were concerned, and there was no question as to the security being sound;   he would suggest that the matter be looked into.    The President said that the Government would not be willing to intefere with the
IjSHIPBUILDING. (Contd).direction of the committee, as the Committee had been given an independent judgment and there could not be an appeal from it to a Government Department where it is a question of the financial soundness of a proposition.   Colonel Lithgow said that some applications had been rejected, according to his information, for other than financial reasons.   The President said that if particulars could be given of the cases which Colonel Lithgow had in mind, where questions of financial soundness were not involved, he would show them to the Treasury.Proceeding, Colonel Lithgow said that in his opinion the publicity which had been given to the recent success of the &quot;Germans in obtaining a British order for building motor ships had been harmful to us, since it would induce shipowners who were thinking of building, to get prices from our foreign competitors.COAL .ADAM NIMMO (by letter)&quot;I regret that I am unable to give a satisfactory Report as to the conditions prevailing in the Coal Industry.&quot;Since the last Meeting of the Advisory Council the position has not improved.    There is a fall in output in February 1925, as oompared with February 19 24, of 530,000 tons in round figures, and for the two weeks ending 14th March, the reduction in respect of the first weak compared with last year is 550,000 tons and in the second week 527,000 tons.&quot;The quantity of coal exported in February 19 24, was, in round figures, 5,075,000 tons, whereas in February 1925, this quantity had fallen to 4,344,000 tons, a difference of 730,000 tons.&quot;It would almost appear from these figures as if there had been a larger inland consumption in February 1925, as compared with February 1924, but I think that a olose analysis of the position would go to how that this apparent increased consumption would be represented by an increase in stocks both at the Collieries and In the hands of the consumers.&quot;There can be little doubt that unemployment In the Industry is steadily increasing, the percentage having risen from 2.4,3 in 1924 to 10.4$ In February 1925.   Trade Is exceedingly slack In most of the districts of the Country and there has been a fall in the number of days on which the pits wound coal from 5.66 days per week in February 1924 as compared with 5.31 days per week in February 1925.    It was reported by the Minister of Mines in the House of Commons on the 3rd of March that the total number of pits that had been closed since 1st January 1924 and not reopened was 415, employing 68,400 tfage Earners.
CONFIDENTIAL. COAL.   (Ooaifcd. ) .&quot;The problem confronting the Collieries of the Country at the present time is an exceedingly difficult one. Volume of trade can only be developed in two leading directions, the one by an expansion of the Export   Trade and the other by a much healthier condition of things being established in the iron, steel and shipbuilding industries of the country.    In both oases an impetus of trade can only be secured by substantially lower costs In tho production of coal, but many readjustments of costs will require to take place before any further material reduction in the cost of coal oan be brought about.    Cost of materials and heavy transport charges bear substantially against the cost of production of coal, and until a lower level has been reached in respect of these charges the Goal Industry will continue to fight an unequal battle and, for some time at any rate, it looks as If outputs would continue to fall and unemployment to increase.&quot;ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. MR. HUGO HIRST (by letter)&quot;Business generally, has been distinctly quieter during the last few weeks over and above the normal slackening that always takes plaoe at this season of the year In supply material.    Buyers generally seem to be much more cautious, and are purchasing smaller parcels of goods, for day to day requirements only.   The incoming  work is not smaller than It was at this time last year, but the rate of Increase notice-able during the Autumn months compared with the. previous year, has appreciably slackened.    Competition is somewhat keener; this Is particularly noticeable in districts which are largely dependent on ooal, steel, and shipbuilding    industries, where owing to the slackness of trade, what orders are plaoed, are plaoed at extremely competitive prices.&quot;On the Heavy Engineering side of the business, things are still extremely quiet, and during the last few weeks, very little big work has been placed.    In some instances owing to lower costs of production, Contracts have been placed in Continental countries, Belgium, etc.&quot;Export business still continues poor. Australia and South Afrioa shew signs of improvement, but In other markets notably India, China and the Argentine, conditions are much below normal.&quot;Summing up the situation, I should say that generally speaking in the Electrical Trade, the outlook is not as satisfactory as It was last Autumn.&quot;SHIPPING. SIR ALAN ANDERSON&apos;(by letter):-I give below, a note from the Chamber of Shipping on the present position, which is, by general consent, as bad as,  If not worse than, it has ever boon.

The rough ground which the importing ootton trade there had, so to speak, to traverse, now seemed to have been crossed, and accumulations of dear goods had been cleared,     There remained, however, a restriction of trade between Indians themselves he was not referring to restrictions of bank credit - resulting from a laok of trust between man and man,     Thie state of affaire was not to be traoed to political causes, but was the result of experience in the past, when both merchants and customers had let eaoh other down,     This laok of confidence was one of the fundamental features of the Indian situation to-dayj    so muoh so that even if the price of cotton goods corresponded to pre-war prioes, he doubted if trade channels would at the present time be sufficiently open to do a pre-war trade for this reason alone.
TEXTILES: COTTON.   (Contd.)As regards Indian competition with this country, he did not consider that the Bombay mills were competing with us on the same lines, since they catered for wants which we could supply but did not.      The Indian mills could deal with cotton of     inch staple, and produce good material from it, without rejecting the waste as we do, but utilising it to make heavy cotton blankets, which are in demand for the Indian and South african markets.     He doubted If the Indian mills were producing more cheaply than ours, but their advantage lay in the fibre they use.     We also could use it, he thought, if we could organise certain sections of our cotton trade on the same lines to produce the same economical results:    some Pars.ee mill owners in Bombay- with whom he had conversed supported this view.     Other European countries used much more Indian cotton than Ourselves.     A considerable amount of Indian cotton is utilised in Lancashire, but this is largely for hosiery, and does not help in competition in the Asiatic world, and moreover none of it is of less than 7/8ths of an inch staple, even the 7/8th staple cotton being described here as &quot;low grad9M. .   Cotton of shorter stsple than this was never brought to this country at all.If steps could be takon to avail ourselves of the shorter staple Indian cotton in the way he had suggested, this should prove of much assistance to us in the Chinese market, for example, where Japanese competition was now acutel    this was regarded by the Bombay mill owners as a direct competition with themselves, and they felt it much more acutely than we do.He thought it should be possible for the Bombay and Lancashire mill owners to agree on a considered policy which, without prejudicing our own Indian trade, would protect the Indian industry against the severe competition which it is now experiencing owing to conditions of labour in Japan,MR. JUDSON said that,  so far as any change had taken place in the cotton industry, he thought it was slightly for the worse.      35 hours per week were still being worked in the American Section,    stocks were accumulating, and prices had declined somewhat.In the Egyptian Section a beginning was being made of stopping machinery, owing to the great increase in the price of Sakel cotton.It was true that the price of American Cotton had declined slightly during the last week.     Whereas reports of drought had before been used as a pretext in the States for discounting the prospects of their cotton crop, it was now being put about that there had been too much rain.
TEXTILES? COTTON (Oontd).It should be mentioned that there was to be a oonferenoe on the following Friday of the federated manufacturers, bleachers, &amp;c, it was to be hoped that, by getting together, the various sections, some of which at present seemed to be living on the others, might be able to come to arrangements between themselves whioh would enable prices to be reduoed.GENERAL TRADE: WOOL TEXTILES.COLONEL vWILLEY, speaking from the point of view of the Federation of British Industries, observed that the predic-tions which had been made last month, to the effect that if a rise took plaoe in the bank rate, comparative stagnation of trade was likely to ensue seemed now to be justifying themselves.The information received by the Federation from industry as a whole was to the effect that the early promise of January had faded rapidly.   There seemed to be a general damping-down of future prospects, though It was difficult to say whether this was due to deflation, paving the way to the anticipated return to the gold standard, or to economic forces asserting themselves, and to a realisation that our prioeB are too high to secure any large volume of foreign business.The point made by Sir Arthur Balfour as to traders&apos; disinclination, In view of the level of prices now ruling, to embark on a volume of trade such as would give a good continuous occupation to industrial plants, well merited consideration, he thought, from a bonking point of view.   If a volume of trade was to be done, approaching full-time operation, there would, he considered, have to be much more credit granted for export business.   In many trades a difficulty was being experienced, in dealing with foreign firms which pay by bills drawn on foreign concerns: If anything could be done to facilitate the liquidation of such bills, more trade would become possible.   In some trades it seemed doubtful If full time could be worked undor present conditions of oredit, since probably the oredit resources available at banks would not be sufficient to keep up the turnover.    In some such oases, full time operation should make it possible to meet foreign competition? but so long as they were working only to 50$ or 60$ of oapaclty they oould not compete, for example, with Italian works which, by means of night shifts etc were managing to work up to some 120$ of normal oapaclty.    This was true not only of tho textile but also of the metallurgical trades and heavy trades generally.In the wool textile industry, the present sentiment was disoouraging but the position was somewhat difficult to understand.    There had been a substantial fall of prices which had had a depressing effect? it was now also evident that the world oonsumption of wool textiles was not nearly enough to absorb an output of the volume whioh the home industry required to keep it fully active.A noticeable downward tendency had developed within the last few weeks in the United States in most lines of industry, and it was widely felt that prioe3 there would .soon show a fall.
GENERAL TRADE: WOOL TEXTILES (Oontd.)In general, costs of production in our wool textile trade were too high to make it possible to give good employment to labour.In reply to an enquiry by tho President, whether the fall In wool prices had stimulated buyers, Mr. Sutcliffe Smith said no, sinoo they were Inclined to hold off for a further drop: conditions took some time to readjust themselves to the new level.TEXTILES: WOOL.MR^ANDREWS said that the situation of the Wool sorting and oombing industries was much the same as the previous month, or a little worse.Prices were a little more stable, but no one oared to acquire large stocks of wool and wool products at the present cost of production.Some anxiety was being felt as to the supposed dosire of the banks for a return to the Gold standard: traders were wondering if the cost of that step would be worth while.There was a   desire throughout the trade to reduce their holdings and commitments and to avoid speculation. Costs still continued too high.TEXTILES: WORSTED ETC.MRo 3UTCLIFFE; SMITH said that textiles were much depressed, the &apos;Srop &quot;in wool prices had had a disturbing effect on the trade, and buyers wero holding off until the prioe of manufactured articles dropped correspondingly.The fancy and novelty trade had kopt going pretty well, but it was in any case a risliy and hand-to-mouth one, In which manufaoturers could not afford to keep stocks.Total unemployment was a littlo better, but there had boon an increase in short time.    Bradford spinners had been talking, of organising short time, but no decision in tlr*.s direction had yet been taken.    Spinners were only working to about 2/&amp;rds. of capacity.A census carried out by manufacturing firms showed that less than 50fo of looms were now running.   Ho had hoard that tho manufacturers had taken a ballot vote on the question whether a Government inquiry should be asked for, undor the Safeguarding of Industries scheme, Into the conditions of their trade, and some QOft of tho votes were in favour of an inquiry.The export trade was quieter, though tho demand fromthe Dominions was fairly good.
TEXTILEG: WORSTED, etc.The competition of France, Czecho-Slovakia and Italy-was serious in all markets.    Great hopes were placed however, in the possibility of a stabilized raw material; this would give confidence and help to steady trade.With regard to Japan, it was still uncertain what their new tariff rates would be.It was understood that negotiations were in progress between Czecho-Slovakia and Hungary for a mutually preferential treaty.    This, if it materialised, would be rather a serious development, since Czecho-Slovakia was a powerful competitor of ours in textiles.Mr. Sutoliffe Smith also referred to the Anglo-German Commercial Treaty, which had not yet been ratified, and observed that under the special provisions of the Versailles Treaty the French were believed to have exported to Germany a good deal of material described as produce of Alsace which was not really 30.The President said that representations had been made to both the French and German Governments to the effect that, in any event, we could not submit to receiving any Issb favourable treatment than was accorded to Alsace-Lorraine Textiles.CHEMICALS.MR......PERRY said that during the first three months of thisyear there had been a distinct falling off in the general chemical trade; the index commodity, Sulphurlo acid, was down by lO/o, and the plant was only working up to about half its capacity.    The same percentage held good for practically all ohemical products, except fertilisers:    In the case of Super-phosphates the position was much more serious and he was glad that a Committee was now to inquire into the application for an import duty.    Foreign competition seemed likely to kill our industry altogether.if no action were taken.In reply to a question by the President, Mr. Perry said that the deoline in the output of Sulphuric Acid was rather to be attributed to the falling off in consumption in thie   country,   than to increased competition from abroad. There appeared to be a slump in world demand.POTTERY.MR* HOLLINS    said that conditions in the Pottery trade remained muoh as during the previous month.    Export business continued good, but the home tirade was not so good.The Earthenware and fine China trades, which work for both gome and export, were doing well, as also were   electrical fittings, sanitary earthenware and fire clay.Unemployment and under-employment remained much as before.
CONFIDENTIAL. RUBBER    MANUFACTORES.MR.; BIRLEY said that, taken all round, the rubber trade had been very fairly employed; their chief difficulty was occasioned by the lovness of foreign prices.   The most important question at the moment from rubber manufacturers&apos; point of view was that of raw material.   Stocks of raw rubber in London were now much reduced, and prices had advanced. The manufacturers1 representative on the Stevens-on Committee was pressing for a speedier release to be allowed after the end of April, when the next revision was due to take place, than the 10% increase which would be warranted if (as there seemed every reason to expect) the price of rubber then stood at over l/6d per lb.   The present allowed percentage was 60$, Present indications seemed to point to the likelihood of a -serious stringency.   Stocks of rubber In the United States were apparently also down, though it was difficult to rely on... the reports received from there.The President enquired whether Mr. Blrley agreed with the statements being made that the present situation leads to a .good deal of speculation in rubber.Mr. Blrley replied that it was not easy to say, since spot transactions were not seen,&apos; but it was a possibility; and the likelihood of fluctuations did not help the trade.There had been a falling off in new business in water-proofs.   The surgical department of the trade was affeoted by German, and the rubber toy se-ction by French and American, competition.    The seasonal shipments to the Argentine   were up to the average, and the volume of business generally was good; but prices were low, and left little margin of profit, -our manufacturers following the quotations of their French and other competitors as far as possible.The President observed that the export figures appeared, to be going up: Mr. Birley replied that there was nothing to complain of as regards export business.   Importation of French and American solid tyres had, however, increased, and was a good deal larger than a year ago.Referring to Mr. Birley*s observations in regard to the restriction of rubber output. Sir Gilbert Grindle remarked that the Stevenson Scheme was automatic in its operation, and left no room for discretionary reliefs.   The President observed it was a question whether there should not be a power to give such relief.   Sir Gilbert Grindle replied that while this suggestion might well be considered, the scheme, which was put into operation by Orders of the Legislative Counoils In Malay and Ceylon, at present made no provision for It.
..GKNSRA&apos;L TRADE.MR. MACHIN, speaking from the point of view of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, said that in manufacturing generally business was being done, but not profitably.   There was less feeling of confidence now than a few months ago, and the outlook -was not clear.He had recently returned from a visit of some weeks to the Continent where he found that the Belgian outlook was better than for some years,past, but in France a certain amount of nervousness and uncertainty was noticeable.    In neither country, however, were there any signs of want of employment or of anxiety as to the general trade outlook.    The conditions from which we were at present suffering in this country were attributable to (l) excessive taxation, and (2) unduly high eost of production.   The wage earners here needed to realise that, to be able to compete successfully, we must get into reasonable correspondence with working conditions abroad. Generally it might be said that hours of work in European countries were ten a day, and costs 30^ less than ours.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON said that conditions in Australia continued good: there had been good rains.   The Wool clip had all been shorn, and all wheat harvested.   The next six months would be a quiet time from the producing point of vie?/.For the seven months ending 31st January, 1925, Australia&apos;s exports amounted to of-million   sterling, and imports 88 million  .    Of the exports the main items were, &quot;-Tool 44 million  , Sheep-skins 3^1111 on  , Wheat 8* million  , Flour 3 million  , and Meat 3i&quot; million  .The outlook for beef was better, and, according to reports received, the continued demand from the Continent practically ensured a profitable market for the beef surplus. There was likely also to be a larger export of apples. Arrangements wore being made for grading and supervising the export of dairy produce, meat and fruit;-the question of selling arrangements was also under consideration.This year Queensland reported 6,000 acres under pure Durango Cotton - a new variety of high quality introduced from Texas: the Government proposed to inspect all plots of this variety, with a view to maintaining a true type.The general position in Australia was decidedly hopeful.
INDIAN      TRADE,Mr. Lindsay said that India was now In the middle of the export season,  and exports were heavy;    but at the same time the rupee was weakening,  probably because there had been a good deal of rupee buying arranged forward, and export bills were somewhat scarce.The official rate for the rupee was now 2/-:    It had not stood as high as this for a long time,  the normal rate being considered to be about l/6d.    It was understood that the French Government were contemplating putting on a surcharge duty on account of the position of Indian currency, and there seemed a possibility that Australia might take some similar step.    This might discourage the fixing of the official rupee rate so high In future,Imports of gold into India were heavy, but if the Government were to fix the rupee at,  say,  l/4d,  probably there would be heavy re-exports of gold,A good deal of the distrust between dealer and consumer, to which Sir W, Clare-Lees had referred in connection w ith the Indian Cotton trade, arose during the post-war slump, when the demand which was expected up country did not materialise.    This state of affairs would no doubt be healed in time.As regards the utilisation of Indian cotton in this country Mr. Lindsay said that the demand In Manchester was now for the best type of Indian cotton only, but the trade was now a sound one, and there were repeat demands for the best types.     Last year larger quantities of Indian cotton had been bought, but much of it was practically   unusable,Mr. Lindsay also put in a provisional statement,  open to revision in a month&apos;s time,  showing the progress of the Indian cotton crop during the past ten years.    This showed the following main results:-Description	Average output 1915-18 (in 1,000 bales)	Output 1924-1925 ( in I. 000 bales)	% IncreaseShort Staple 7 (belovf&amp;ths inch)	5080	4180	35,71Long Staple 7 ( 8&quot;ths Inch and over)	1043	1808	73.35Total Indian Cotton	4123	5938	45,23The higher ratio of increase in the output of long-staple  cotton showed that India had not been inactive as regards improving     the Staple.
CHINESE TRADE,MR, LANDALE said that in the export of Manchester goods to China there was a moderate business being transacted.    In the export to China of machinery, railway material etc., however, little business was being done.As regards imports from China, business was increasing, no doubt owing to the lower exchange and the gradual improve-ment of Continental markets.With regard to the Trade Marks question, British owners of Trade Marks were now registering their marks under the new Chinese Law,  although certain provisions of the law are contrary to existing treaties? it was to be regretted that the British Legation had failed to obtain any modification of the Chinese Law,  such as the appointment of foreign experts to the Registration Bureau, or foreign judges to assist in appeal cases.    It seemed very doubtful whether registration would give the protection required for British traders,With regard to the Chinese Government Railways, Mr. Landale observed that the British Issue of the Peking-Mukden railway^r Loan amounted to  2,500.000, aid  1,150,000 was still outstanding.   Under the agreement with the Chinese Government this Loan ms to be a first charge upon the entire property of the railway, with Its freight and earnings.    Its surplus earnings were also hypothecated as part security for certain other British Railway Loans in China.In 1922 the section of the railway outside the Great Wall was illegally seized by the Fengtien military authorities, and had since been retained by them.   As a result of this, the financial position of the Railway had become very serious, and the payments for its loan service were now in default.In the interests of the British holders of the Loan Bonds, and British trade generally, he urged that it was of the utmost importance that the section confiscated by the military authorities be restored to the Railway Administra-tion and the whole line freed from military tyranny and control.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE. MR. R.J.HOSE (by letter):-&quot;Brazilian foreign trade continues to expand both as regards imports and exports, and, moreover, the favourable balance of trade continues to increase, with a corresponding advance in the potential purchasing power of the inhabitants. The political situation is more settled, and the Government appears to be   -making honest endeavours to adjust the un-satisfactory state of national finances, pending which the milreis . remains very depreciated and unstable, and present conditions are not favourable for the introduction of further foreign capital.    I can see no Immediate prospect of any Important expansion in the Brazilian market for British goods.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE. (Contd.)&quot;Conditions in Chile resemble those in Brazil in some measure, inasmuch as, whilst foreign trade Is inc.rea.sing and the favourable balance growing, the peso remains unstable at under 6d., and it is obvious that the large native exporting interests benefit thereby, but that importers suffer.    The recent political disturbances have also naturally induced traders to restrict activities.    I can see no prospect of any immediate substantial increase in demand for imported goods unless both the political situation and the nations], finances become adjusted, and it is therefore encouraging that cable advices received as recently as Friday last from a most reliable Chilean source stated that the situation now appears settled and the outlook more reassuring, whilst national financial equilibrium is also rapidly being restored, for, as compared with an accumulated deficit in 1923 of /110,000,000 (Paper), receipts and expenditure in 1924 are expected to balance, and the Budget far 1925 shows a small estimated surplus.    The Presidential elections will be held in May, and, If a strong sound Government were elected and the stabilisation of the currency seriously tackled (and it must be remembered that Chile&apos;s currency has a substantial gold backing),market prospects in Chile should then be much brighter.&quot;In Peru, trade is rather dull at present, and no Improvement is looked for until the middle of the year.   There is little money about, which is not to be wondered at in view of the expenditure on the recent Centenary celebrations. Representatives of foreign exporting houses report that local merchants are well stocked, and, owing to the uncertainty as regards exchange and the general dull outlook, they are not placing orders for more than immediate requirements.&quot;There can be no doubt that the brightest prospects for British trade with South America in the near future are in the River Plate district. In 1924, Argentina&apos;s wealth was con-siderably increased by her record exports of grain and meat, as well as her large shipments of wool, the favourable balance trade established being about $230,000,000 (gold) - say  40,700,000 sterling.   With regard to the current year, It is as yot rather too early to make any prediction of the world demand for Argentine products, especially in view of the. pre-present   unsettlement in the cereal and wool markets.    The estimated amounts of wheat, linseed, and oats available for export during 1925 average about 25)? lower than last year, but this fall will probably be counterbalanced to a large extent if not entirely by higher average prices, whilst the amount of maize available for export is only about 12% lower than last year.    Shipments of wool in the first two months of this year have been about 33/5&apos; less than those in the corresponding period of 1924, and, with the  recent drop of 10-15^ in London prices, Argentina&apos;s revenue from this source will be lessened.    Shipments of meat in 1925 to date are on about the same scale as last year, but, although the European demand may continue, it is believed that last year&apos;s enormous drain cn cattle herds is beginning to make itself felt,&quot;In all the circumstances, therefore, there may be a small diminution in Argentina&apos;s receipts of wealth from the sale of her commodities abroad during the present year, although such

Shipments of wool in the first two months of this year have been about 33$ less than those in the corresponding period of 1924, and, with the  recent drop of 10-15$ in London prices, Argentina&apos;s revenue from this source will be lessened.   Shipments of meat in 1925 to date are on about the same scale as last year, but, although the European demand may continue, it is believed that last year&apos;s enormous drain cn cattle herds is beginning to make itself felt.&quot;in all the circumstances, therefore, there may be a small diminution in Argentina1s receipts of wealth from the sale of her commodities abroad during the present year, although such
CONFIDENTIAL. SOUTH AMEBICAN TRADE  (GONTD.).receipts should still be proportionately very large as compared with those in the &quot;slump&quot; years of 1921-23.&quot;The increased value of tho Argentine dollar should stimulate Imports, especially as tho heavy stockn of goods laid up in 1923 in anticipation of higher tariffs have doubtless row been largely liquidated.      That this movement has commenced would appear to be indicated by an increase of about 10^ in the Buenos Aires Customs receipts for January-February,  1925, as compared with the first two month of 1924.     Whether or not these purchases will be iTiade in the British market depends up^n factors which are outside my province, but, other things being   equal, British interests are assisted by the popularity of British goods, whilst a possible fillip to the further adoption of English styles and goods may result from the visit of H.R.H. The Prince of Wales.&quot;The foregoing remarks regarding Argentina apply in proportionate degree to Uruguay&quot;.BANKING.MR. TENNANT said that he had been abroad during the past month, but was told that the principal feature here was the continued stringency in the short money market.    The rate for bills was now -1$ below last month and was slipping away. Probably this was due to the fact that a good&quot;deal of American and other money was being put into sterling Bills. The issue of the Conversion loan had been the principal matter of recent interest: it had had the effect of depressing the old Conversion loan, but this, it was to be hoped, would recover with time.With regard to the point raised by Colonel Willey as to the likelihood of a shortage of credit if trade recovered, Mr. Tennant said that it was difficult to give a definite answer.    Our traders were no doubt not as well situated now as before the war to give credit abroad, and if trade generally went up by as muoh as 100^ at the same prices as now, difficulties as to credit might well be met with: but it was unlikely that prices would, in fact, remain unchanged in that event.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE said, that with regard to Colonel Willeyfe question, there was plenty of credit at present available in the banks, and the supply could be increased if necessary.We had departed considerably from the pre-war situation as regards the proportion of advances to deposits, which was a good deal less than in 1913. It was true that at the moment advances were Increasing and deposits decreasing, but that was a normal feature at this period of the year when taxes were being gathered in, and probably the situation would be redressed shortly.
BANKING, (ctd.).The figures of all the Clearing Banks&apos; reaultB for   the last month were not yet out; but the figures for three of them were available, and showed a decrease of 28 million   in deposits, accompanied by an inorease of 9 million &amp; in loans; but, even so, as already stated, the proportion of advances to deposits remained a good deal less than in 1913.He did not anticipate any difficulty for the banks to-Inorease credit if required.   The real difficulty seemed to lie In a lack of confidence as between man and man, to which Sir W. Olare-Lees had referred as a feature of the situation In India.   Traders were afraid of shouldering the risk themselves of giving long credit to European customers; the banks would probably help up to 2 or three months, but credit for as much as two years would be abnormally long for them.Colonel Armstrong remarked that manufacturers had lost large amounts of working capital, and were therefore unable to look up large blockB of capital by giving credit to customers abroad, if they could not discount the bills.Mr. Beaumont Pease said he agreed,that, if large demands were made on them for two or three years&apos; oredit. the banks would have to revise their Ideas as to what constituted sound banking praotioe.Colonel Willey said that many firm now found it more difficult to discount bills on their old-established European customers than before the war. the attitude of the banks to such bills had undergone a oh&amp;nge.Mr. Beaumont Pease replied that the British banker 11 looks to his British customer   in this matter, and not to the latter&apos;s customers abroad.   It was true that the banks do not re-discount.   Possibly there might be a difficulties certain amount of difficulty if a large demand developed for-more prolonged oredit.Proceeding to deal with the general banking situation, MR. PEASE said that the chief recent event of importance was tne raxsing of the Bank Rate.    This action was generally attributed to a desire to make London a more attractive monetary centre than the United States, and this object seemed to have been attained.    The raising of the United States Bank Rate, followed by our own, had left us In a better posltionj the American exchange had improved by several Cents, and was remaining firm.The Press had made reference to the unsettled feeling oaused in some quarters by uncertainty as to the Governments intentions with regard to a return to the Gold Standard.; Some ofELoial announcement on this subjeot would be welcome; the present uncertainty produced a certain uneasiness in monay market circles.
BANKING.In spite of the rise in the Bank Rate, the market bill rate had not gone up to the same extent.   This was probably due largely to the increased demand from abroad for   British commercial bills, of which the supply was rather small and the price rather high.The stock markets were in a somewhat nervous and uncertain condition, and had been affected also by the new Conversion Loan.In reply to a question by the President, as to whether it would be true to describe the present position generally as one of stagnation, Mr. Pease said that the situation in the less important trades seemed slightly better, but In the main trades there had not been much change.The amount of overdrafts was slightly up in February as compared with January; this tendency had since gone on, and March showed a further increase over February.C J-DPgaATIVE, SOCIETIES . -SIR THOMAS ALLEN said that the figures of the Co-Operatl Societies&apos;  trading indicated that business was down by 6% on the year and 2% on the quarter.    Prices of all food commodities were up, except sugar and flour.   Y/heat was down by 7/6d. per quarter on the month; the importation of 8i million quarters of Australian wheat had been a contributory factor in this decline.   The benefit of the reduction had not, however, yet reached the consumer.Russia was a large buyer of wheat and flour at the present time; but for this she was going mainly to the United States; he thought that better facilities for credits were given in the United States than In the United Kingdom.Over the whole range of essential food stuffs there was little relief in commodity prices, and little disposition was shown by the distributors to pass on what relief there was. The purchasing power of the consumer was, at present, on the decline.   He hoped that the Food Commission^ report would bring home to distributors that they were falling in their duty to the public in this respeot.    The distributive system was, he considered, one of the weakest points in this country&apos;s trade organisation.UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES  (MINISTRY  OF&quot; LABOUR).MR. PHILLIPS said he had to report a series of small decreases in the unemployment figures during the last month, amounting in total to about 35,000.. Last year, in the same period, there was a decrease of 71,000, and the figure for March 23rd last was higher by 137,800 than the figure for March 24th, 1924.    It was truo that some 70,000 ought

HILL (Ministry of Transport) said that the latest available railway traffic.statistics showed that the earlier increase over last year, both in receipts and tonnage, had now diminished; for the week ended 22nd Llarch tonnage was actually less than for the corresponding period last year, in spite of the strike which was then in progress.   The general indication therefore seemed to be that traffic on the railways was falling.The figures he had referred to had not yet been sub-divided between heavy traffic and general traffic, but those for January, which were so divided, showed that general merchandise traffic had increased as compared with last year, while iron ore and pig iron showed a decrease.SIR HERBERT WALKER (by letter):-   uThe latest informa-tion I have is that traffics generally are shrinking appreciably.;&apos;This applies to some extent to general merchandise and to a far greater extent in the case of the heavy industries, such as where steel, iron and coal are concerned&quot;

Statement regarding the Export Trade position made at the Meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Overseas Trade on the 18th March, 1925.IROB AST) SgBBL.Mr. Bond could record no improvement In the heavy iron and steel industries.   The imports of steel into the country were still in the neighbourhood of 200,000 tons monthly,   The tinplate and sheet industry which was formerly holding its own was not now in such a good position. Tinplate manufacturers were faced with increasing competition from French and German producers and were hampered by high costs of production.   No bright outlook was envisaged in relation to the iron and steel industry.Mr. C.H. Wilson reported a better state of business in the lighter Sheffield industry.     German prices had recently bean increased so that competition from that country was less acute.   Great interest had&quot;been taken In Sheffield in an exhibition of samples of foreign cutlery furnished by the Department of Overseas Trade.   The samples had been examined by a large number of persons In the trade and the general conclusion reached&quot;was that foreign competition was less to be feared than had been hitherto supposed.gggglgg^Mr. H.W. Lee reported that no change had occurred since he spoke at the last meeting in regard to the hours worked in the cotton trade.   There was, however, no accumulation of stocks,   While he could record no definite improvement he saw no reason to be pessimistic about the future situation.   He was informed by the Chairman that the Licensing Committee of the Board of Trade was dealing with the question pf cheap reparation dye wares which certain countries were receiving, and that it was hoped to make a report on this question&quot;at the next meeting of the Committee.Colonel Willey, referring to his previous report, could only speak of intensified depression in the wool textile trade.   This state of affairs was not confined to Great Britain, as the entire machinery of the world was insufficiently employed, the real reason in his opinion being that demand was stationary at below the aggregate production capacity of the world.   He estimated that worsted machinery was only occupied to the extent of 607?-.   Prance remained our most powerful competitor in the world market. Unemployment in the Yorkshire woollen district was increasing and the present position was worse than at any time since 1920.     He desired to point out certain extraordinary advances in efficiency which had. been made in this trade in the United States of America.     In the cotton trade with the use of automatic looms sixty looms were under the supervision of one weaver and tender, while in the woollen trade sixteen looms were under the supervision of one weaver.     In machinery engaged on similar production in Great Britain the automatic loom&quot; was much less in use and the number of operatives required in order to comply with Trade Union rules, was
enormously greater.     To Illustrate the efficiency of the automatic loon he instanced that a reduction in the number of operatives In the cotton trade in one mill from 1,100 to 600 had. been made, without impairing the output.     Exports of woollen cloth from Great Britain were momentarily suffering from cheap competition from. Italy and. Czechoslovakia.     Raw material was in increasing: demand recent orders of considerable extent having, come &quot;from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Russia.INDIAN TRADE.Sir Charles MoLeod referring to India stated that export trade from there had recently been good, and as a corollary he expected that Imports would shew an Increase &apos; almost immediately.     Jute prices had risen to some considerable extent, while prices for tea had dropped,-   The cotton crop was reported to be good.     He had been informed that Lancashire was adapting its machinery for the working up of Indian cotton, which appeared likely to become in staple use there.     The rice crop in Burmah had been excellent, b$ct the financing of it was causing a certain tightness of money.     There had been a considerable demand for engines and. excavating machinery for new works.     There was a notable extension of railway facilities in that the main line of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway was being connected with the recently developed port of VIsagapatam,EAST AFRICA.The situation from East Africa had been reported to Sir Charles McLeod as very encouraging.     The cotton crop which amounted in 1924 to 130,000 bales had run out in 1925 at 170,000 hales.     In answer to an enouiry Sir Charles stated, that he was not of opinion that there was any shortage of ginning machinery as new ginneries were being put up freely both by Europeans and Indians.     The sisal crop had been a good one and had been aold at profitable prices. The Importation of general roods was &quot;on a free scale and generally speaking the whole of the Bast African Colonies were in a much improved state,CHINA TRADE.Mr, Dodwell stated that little or no change had occurred in the China trade.     Deliveries had recently been good, particularly In the South of China, but new orders were not corning forward in satisfactory bulk.
