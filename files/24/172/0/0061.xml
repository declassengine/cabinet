O f)THIS JJUOTM^T- IS TnE PROPERTY UP hlfc BRIT^ittilG MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT).0 A b I N E T.P. 161^125 )j,&quot;    &quot; London University, King&apos;s College andthe Imperial Institute,feemorandum by the First Commissioner of Works,I should of covr.se be very ready, if the Cabinet so desired, to examine the London University proposal out^ lined in the minute of the Controller of Supply Services (CP, 143(25)   ).   It would he necessary first of all to find out whether the Dominions would be prepared to leave the present building and accept alternative accommodation.. Secondly, would they require this accommodation for their administrative offices and. the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, or would they require the far larger amount of space necessary for the exhibition of their products,    would they, in the latter case, be satisfied with the money grant to assist the individual shows in the offices of. the High Commissioners?.I understand, however, that the Colonial Secretary is opposed to any negotiations with the High. Commissioners until the Imperial Institute Bill, which sets up a new governing body, shall have become ,law.   Pie is further opposed, I believe, to any amendment to that Bill which would enable the new governing body to accept a new site.    Clearly, unless I had some knowledge of the views of. the Dominions it would be difficult to proceed very far with my investigation.On the other side, the scheme assumes that the University would not be. unwilling to accept accommodation atthe
the Imperial Institute.    I 1\rv&amp; read the memorandum by the President of the Board of Education (G .P.153 (25)), who desires to keep open the question of the Bloomsbury site until the present Departmental Committee has reported and the Government has decided on this policy.    He himself does not despair of the Bloomsbury site,    If, then, I am not permitted to enquire into the views of the High Commissioners on the possible transfer, and if the question of the Bloomsbury site is to be kept open for some t ime, it is difficult to  see what scope, for the present at least,  there would be for my activities,(Intld.)     p&quot;17th March,  1925.
