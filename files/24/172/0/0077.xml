as^DOCUsra1 is the propertt of his Britishc lax^sTrs ao^RKJfiKT. ,      1^ CABINET. - -P  177 (OPl) -    &apos; &apos;JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS (REGULATION OF REPORTS) &apos;BILL*lemorandixm by the Secretary for Scotland. . j1, I concur in the view expressed by the Home Secretary &quot;     !j in Iiis Memorandum cp,, 163 (25) that it is important that adecision should bo taken on tho line to be adopted by. the Govorrraont towards Sir Evelyn Cecil&apos;s Bill.     &apos; .i   2. The Bill as drafted would be applicable to Scotlandand that is presumably the intention of those responsible for It.- 3. After consultation with tho Lord Advocate I consider.. :I that the Bill.in its. present form is yory unsatisfactory fortho following reasons;-. - &quot; - ....Clause; 1 ,(1) fa) makes it an;-offence to publish \e&apos;tcv, in i relation t*o any judicial proe codings any indecent master or ;]j medical, etc. &apos; details boii^g.matter or;details/&apos; the publicationof which would be &quot;calculated to injure public morals .cc or-her-I       -wise be to the public, misohiaf&quot;.&apos; ... This provision arjpears to beunworkable because it docs not sufficiently inform the&apos;li ogos I what they may:or may not do. - . The- Question -whether- a thing       ;I i3 Calculated, to injure public morals or otherwise be to tnepublic mischief&quot; is a matter of opinion.Clause 1 (1) Co),.,    It is not clear why this provision (if adopted at- aTi) is restricted to proceedings for dissolution    ..V ^^ of marriage, for nullity of marriage and for judicial separation. -If the particulars to be published ,are to be limited as proposed in this Sub-Clause similar considerations appear to beI       . applicable.in other consistorial actions, i.e., declarators of marriage.or of legitimacy- or bastardy, actiori3 of adherence or of1       -butting to silence.     The question of adding these ScottishI     -  auctions and their&apos;English analogues seems to be a matter forI     .   consideration if the Bill is to proceed.I ,In another respect, restriction of the scope, of clause 1 (1) (b) requires consideration.     In the case of proceedings for nullity of marriage the proposed limitations appear to be necessary only in the caso of actions relating to    - 1-impotency.     There is no reason why. an action of nullity of marriage, eg., on tho ground that the parties had not resided,.-for the requisite poriocl in Scotland, should be treated as the &apos; Bill proposes.i 4. i The Lord President of the Court of Session (lord        Clyae) concurred in the foregoing criticisms when a similar bill was be fore.. Parliament in 1923 and I have no reason to suppose      Vr&apos; I        that his views have altered although- i have not had anopportunity of consulting him on this occasion.I 5. My views upon the whole matter are briefly as follows.It is desirable that&quot;any legislation upon this,,subject should apply equally to England and Wales and&quot;to Scotland.     If,I ,    . however/
however,, the Bill were to be pas sod in its present form I regard.--i os provisions, as: so unsatisfactory that I should : P^l-er to excluae^ Scotland from their; operation.&apos; .  This is also the view of the Lord. Advocate and-it, was the view -expressed in the autumn of 1925 by the Lord President of the Court of Session. &apos;&apos;&apos;JChN GII&amp;OUR&apos;
