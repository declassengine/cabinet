[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.^Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.SECRET. CP. 121 (25).CABINET.REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS;   PACIFIC SETTLEMENT  OF  INTER-NATIONAL DISPUTES;   FRENCH AND BELGIAN SECURITY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE valuable report of Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s Sub-Committee clearly shows that the controversy over the Protocol is developing into a controversy over French and Belgian security. Whilst this evolution was inevitable, it seems to me that there is grave risk that, in our anxiety to find a substitute for the indefinite obligations of Geneva, we may involve ourselves in commitments that will become increasingly embarrassing and dangerous. It is anxiety on this account that makes me add another to the mass of papers upon this difficult issue.2. I believe that the big body of public opinion in Great Britain and almost the whole of public opinion in the Dominions wants to be as free as possible of European commitments. If this feeling had not already existed, M. poincare would have created it. Immediately after the war it was not yet mobilised, nor did it yet realise the militarist tendencies of French policy. It is possible, therefore, that in 1920, and even in 1922, a Coalition Parliament might have accepted an Anglo-French Pact. With things as they are in 1925, I am convinced that, if the country, still more if the Empire, is to accept a Pact, an overwhelmingly strong case must be made for it from the point of view of world peace and the definite advantages that will accrue to British interests.3. Can a case be made for it strong enough to satisfy British public opinion ? Let me first take the military case. The General Staff have issued a paper based upon the assumption that German aggression is still the chief danger to European peace (C.I.D. 562-B). I do not share this view, but, even if I am wrong, it is indisputable that for the next ten or fifteen years France is as militarily secure as any country could conceivably be. Militarily, Germany has ceased to count in Europe. The territory that she most needs for the successful conduct of a war of aggression is either occupied by the Allies or ceded to France. She has no heavy artillery, no military aviation, no navy and no colonies. With a peace army of 100,000 men she is hemmed in by the French peace army of 750,000 men, a Polish army of 250,000, a Czecho-Slovak of 160,000, a Jugo-Slavian of 115,000 and a Roumanian of 210,000 that is to say, by 1,485,000 potential enemies capable of expanding in war time to 5 or 6 millions. As to the future military potentialities to which the General Staff have drawn attention, their anxieties seem to be based upon the assumption that German industry could in a comparatively short time re-equip ihe German people with the armaments for a new European war. I have seen no evidence that Germany is likely to make this attempt, and I doubt whether, if the German Government wished to make it, German industry would or could concentrate its resources upon such a production of munitions. In any case, production upon any scale of this magnitude could not be kept secret, and, as Lord D&apos;Abernon says in his memorandum (C.I.D. 568-B), would be immediately interrupted by French or Allied intervention. As to the German mentality, upon which the Secretary of State for War makes certain observations at the end of his memorandum (C.I.D. 562-B), I hesitate to dogmatise. It does, however, seem to me significant that in the last five years Germany has become less, rather than more, truculent, and in the matter of the Dawes Agreement yielded with little resistance to the reasonable demands of the Allies.[12624 b]
4. The cumulative effect of these considerations leads me to think that, at least for the next fifteen years, France is militarily unassailable on the Continent. If this is the case, it will not be easy to convince a suspicious public opinion that she needs for the present any further military guarantee of her security.5. If, however, I do not admit that there is any present danger, I cannot deny that there may be danger when the temporary guarantees of the Treaty of Versailles come to an end in fifteen years&apos; time. In fifteen years&apos; time French man-power will be relatively weaker even than it is to-day in comparison with German man-power. Thus, according to the General Staff (Appendix (A) to C.I.D. 516-B), by 1940 the French population will be 35,000,000, as against a present figure of 39-g millions, by 1950 it will be down to 31 millions, and by 1965 it will have shrunk still further to 25 millions. As against these progressively diminishing figures the population of Germany in 1922 was 61^ millions; and by 1965 it will amount to over 80 millions. If these figures are correct, they are very disquieting, disquieting from the point of view of French security, but disquieting also from the point of view of British policy. For are we here and now justified in making a military pact when no military guarantee is necessary for fifteen years, and when, at the end of fifteen years, we shall be guaranteeing the security of a country that is swiftly and surely getting weaker every year? It certainly appears to me that it will be difficult to convince the British people, disillusioned by the events of the last five years, that we are not involving the British Empire in a commitment that, for the time being, is unneccessary, and in the future may be extremely dangerous.6. It may, however, be contended that, however strong these objections to a Pact may be, we cannot afford to cut out the effective clauses of the Protocol and to make no offer to France. Personally I do not feel competent to judge of the strength of French public opinion upon the question, or of the extent to which we ought to yield to it, but I have always had the feeling that, whilst the ordinary Frenchman is generally interested in the question, it is the French politicians and the French General Staff who, for obvious reasons, have made security their almost exclusive theme. But even if the French people are solid behind the demand for security, I should yet make two conditions before negotiating with them. I should first make them say definitely and categorically what they want. Time after time we have gone some way in making offers which have subsequently been repudiated or ignored by the French Government. It seems to- me that, in any negotiation, particularly in a negotiation in which we wish to give as little as possible, the first proposal should come from the French and should be made in categorical terms. Secondly, we should make it clear that, if we are to take the unpopular and perhaps dangerous step of giving a guarantee, we must receive in return some counter advantage for the British Empire. Such an attitude would be in strict conformity with our policv at Cannes in 1922, when we informed the French Government that pari passu with agreement to a Pact there must come the settlement of outstanding questions between the two Governments. In the present instance the two questions upon which we should insist upon French readiness to meet us are in my view the Anglo-French debt and the reduction of armaments. If we are to give the French greater security, there is, from all points of view, every reason for their spending less money upon armaments and more money upon the service of our debt. If the integrity of Western Europe is to be safeguarded by a Pact, France does not require a peace establishment of 750,000 men and an air force that is still more than twice the size of our own. A Pact is, in any case, likely to be unpopular enough in this country, and, in my view, the only way to get it accepted at all would be to accompany it with a. reasonable settlement of the French debt and a definite reduction of French armaments.7. Even so, I am doubtful whether we ought at the present moment to embark upon so dangerous a commitment of foreign and military policy. For the danger to European peace seems to me to come not from the possibility of German aggression, but from the division of Europe into two great camps, the camp of the victors and the camp of the vanquished, in which Russia will take its place. It is because I believe that an Anglo-French Pact upon the only lines that will be acceptable to the French will not only be unpopular in Great Britain and the Empire, but will also deepen the trenches between these two camps, that I take the view that further delay is wiser and safer than any immediate action. &quot;Whatever may be said to the contrary, Europe is beginning to settle down. Year by year the hold of finance and trade and industry will become stronger upon peoples and Governments; year by year
the cry for less expenditure upon armaments will become more insistent;.year by year the atmosphere of the war will be dissipated. It is surely wiser to give these forces of peace somewhat longer to develop than to stereotype existing though perhaps temporary divisions, and to embroil the Empire in a policy that is alien to its traditions and dangerous to its unity.8. Let us then try to restrict the scope of the Protocol on the general lines recommended by Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s Committee, and leave it to the French to make their definite proposals to us for security. When these proposals are made, we should test their expediency by the following questions. How far will the adoption of them encourage the more aggressive forces in France ? How far will it harden the division of Europe into two opposing camps? How far will it estrange big bodies of public opinion in Great Britain and the Empire ? At present I am doubtful whether the dangers suggested in these questions are not inherent in any pact proposals.S. H.,Secretary of State for Air.A ir Ministry, February 27, 1925.
