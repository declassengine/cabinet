(THIS DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)1.      The Unemployment Committee have recently had under consideration the serious position from the point of view of Unemployment in the Scottish Shale Oil industry.    The relevant facts are briefly as followsSo      Shortly after the war, in response to the request of the Government,  the Anglo-Persian Oil Company acquired a controlling interest in Scottish Oils3 Ltd0, whioh Company controls and manages the properties of the individual Shale Companies which are situated in Linlithgowshire and Lanarkshire.    At that time the Government were strongly of opinion that the industry ought to be continued both on the ground that this home source of oil was an asset of real value in case of wa r a nd also because of the serious unemployment position in the locality and the absence of alternative work. Scottish Oils,  Ltdo,  have a contract with the Admiralty expiring on 31st March, 1925,  to supply 30,000 tons of oil a year at  12. a toe-    The total output of the mines is approximately 200,000 tons of oil s year in addition to certain by-products and the number of men directly employed in the industry is about 0,200.3o      The total population of the area in which the industry is carried on is roughly 65,000 and it is estimated that 4S$ of this population is directly dependent on the industry. In addition the cessation of the industry would mean throwing out of work about 2,000 ooal miners producing coal used in the industry as well as a number of persons indirectly dependent upon It.    The area is already suffering acutelyC A B I N E TUNEMPL 0YMENTCOMMITTEE.REPORT. ON.....THJL.SCOTTISE. OIL SHALE! MINES

At the present time Scottish Oils, Ltd., are/losing about  240,000 a year;  this loss will be substantially increased on the termination of the present Admiralty contract.    The Company is said to be well and efficiently managed and there is smell prospect of any substantial reduction in the cost of production.    Changes in the future prices of commodities produced by the Company may produce    an increased revenue of about  60,000,THE PROPOSAL   5.    In order to enable the industry to be maintainedOF TEE ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL   Lord Bradbury and Sir Edward Packo.  the Government COMPANY 0Directors of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, have submitted a proposal that the Admiralty should enter into a contract with the Scottish Oils,  Ltd.,   to take the whole output of fuel oil, about 120., 000 tons per annum, at a price of  7. per ton, which, is equivalent to, say,  7.11.0 per ton, delivered,    The Company also offer the Government a share in the profits of certain by-products.    The  7.11,0 compares with  2,5,0. per ton,  the cost of Texas Oil delivered.    On  the basis of 140,000 tons per annum,  the cost would work out -Shale Oil  1,05 7,000Texas    &quot;     455,000

(3) that if once assistance is given political and other considerations will almost certainly compel its continuance* (4) that having regard to the present views of the Admiralty it would not bo easy to maintain the contention that the maintenance of the industry was desirable on defence groundso 8. The Committee are of opinion that if the industryis to be helped, assistance must be given by and through an Admiralty contract,   just ification for special treat-ment being based on the value of the home source of supply in time of war.      In no other way could the case &quot;be successfully differentiated from other distressed industry cases..9c It is not at present possible to estimate,  evenapproximately, the annual sum which would be required to keep the industry in being since the figure must largely depend on the outcome of negotiations between the Admiralty and the Company, and negotiations cannot be begun until a decision has been reached on the question whether State assistance should be given or not.      For the purposes of this Report the figure may be placed at a sum not exceeding  500.. 0C0 per annum. 10, The Committee invite the Cabinet:-(1) To decide the question of principle whether special State assistance to be given by mean-3 of an Admiralty Contract should be

Uir M?10YIaEM T C OLD -ii Tonns.V   T S   En. RipOIvT PIT THE SCOTTISH OIL SHALE MIHHS^1.       Th.a Unorapio.:/ni&apos;3nt Coo dtteo have recently n.nd under consideration the serious position from the point of view of Unemployment in the Scottish Shale Oil industry.     The relevant, facts are briefly as followsS,       Shortly after the war, in resxoonse to the request of the Government, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company acquired a controlling interest in Scottish Oils, Ltd0, which Company controls and manages the properties of the individual Shale Companies which are situated in linlithgowshire and Lanarkshire.   . At that time the Government were...strongly of opinion that the industry ought to he continued both on the ground that this home source of oil was an asset of real value in ease of war and also because of the serious unemployment position in the locality and the absence of alternative work. Scottish Oils, Ltd. have a contract with the Admiralty expiring on 31st March9 19S5, to supply 30,000 tons of oil a year at  12 a ton.    The total output of the mines is approximately 85,000 tons of fuel oil, 15,000 tons of lubricating oil, 36,000 tons of Kerosene and 20,000 tons of motor spirit, a year in addition to certain by-products.    The output of fuel oil could be increased by dropping one refining process.      The number of men directly employed in the industry is about 8,200. 3c,      The total population of the area in which the industry is carried on is roughly 65,000 and it is estimated that 42^ of this population is directly dependent on the industry In addition the cessation of the industry woul  mean throwing out of work about 2,000 coal miners producing coal used in the industry as well as a number of persons indirectly dependent upon it.    The ares,   is already suffering acutely
from -unemployment due to coal trade depression.     As there is no alternative employment in the area the great majority of those employed in the industry will, if the industry is shut down, have to rely on Unemployment Benefit or Poor Law relief.      If the mines are once closed they could only be re-opened at groat expense which might in some cases be almost prohibitive.4.       At the present time,  on the basis of existing costs of production and existinr market prices for the productst treating the favourable Admiralty contract as at an end and without making any provision for depreciation or debenture interest, the shale mining business of Scottish Oils Limited is said to be carried on at a loss of  150,000 a year. Depreciation is said to have been provided for in previous years at the rate of  80,000 a year and debenture interest requires  18,000 a year.      The foregoing figures are on the basis of the whole of the mines and works being kept working, but the closing of 4 works and the mines attached to them employing about 2,000 men and representing less than one-third of the total output would reduce the loss to about  65,000 a year - again making no allowance for depreciation or debenture interest,The Company is said to be well and efficiently managed and there is small prospect of any substantial reduction in the cost of production..Changes in the future prices of commodities produced by the Company may produce an increased revenue of about  60.000 a year with full production, thus reducing the loss apart from provision for depreciation and debenture interest to  88,500 a year if the whole undertaking is maintained and to  24,500 if partial closing down were put into operation..
1 PROPOSAL       5.      In order to enable the industry to be maintained the ANGLO-KSIAN OIL        Lord Bradbury and Sir Edward Packe, the Government Directors of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, have submitted a proposal that the Admiralty should enter into a contract with the Scottish Oils Ltd0y to take the whole output of fuel oil, about 120,. 000 tons per annum,  at a price of  7 per ton, which is equivalent to, say,   7*11.0 per ton, delivered..      The Company also offer the Government a share in the profits of certain by-products,    The  Voile.0 compares with  3o5o0 per ton, the cost of Texas Oil delivered,    On the basis of 140,000 tons per annum, the cost would, work out -Shale Oil  1,057,000Texas    &quot;     455,000Difference     600,000In other words for the cost sf 140,000 tons cf Shale Oil could be obtained 325,000 tons af Texas Oil.    While the Admiralty would regret the loss of the only home source of crude oil, having regard to the comparatively small present and prospective production, they do not now attach the same importance to the maintenance of the supply as was the case in 1920.      The Admiralty, raere-over,  consider that if the above proposal is adopted the increased cost  600,0 00 per annum? should, for Estimate purposes, be treated as a special Unemployment Service&quot; and should not ultimately fall to be charged against Navy Votes.But as the market price of the Company1 s fueSr oil is greater than the market price of Texas oil,  it might be possible to give the Company an equivalent benefit, with substantially reduced cost to the Admiralty, by negotiating a  contract for a comparatively small amount of oil at an increased price.
rrfjE case FORADOPTINGIKE PROPOSAL i60      In favour of the proposal it Is represented -(1) that even If the output of oil is comparativelyinsignificant yet it is important to preserve the only home source of supply-.(2) that serious consequences must result fromadding at least 10,200 men and their dependents to the ranks of the local unemployedc      Assuming these men are all adults eligible for Unemploy-ment Benefit the cost to the Unemployment insurance Fund would not be less than  600,000 per annum.      In addition of course large sums would have to be found locally for Poor Law Relief.(3) that it may prove possible as s result of negotiations to persuade the Company to continue the industry on terms substantially more favourable to the Government than those contained in the present offer.THE CASE 7,AGAINST THE PROPOSAL, (1)On the other hand it has been pointed out that to assist the industry as proposed by means of a concealed subsidy involves a principle which is open to great extension and that it might be difficult to withhold similar benefits from other depressed industries, such as coal mining.3A
(2) that if the industry is really moribund as is said to be the case, the only effect will bo to stereotype for an indefinite period a speoial form of State assistance of a highly uneoonomical and unsatisfactory nature, and pne particularly -ipen to political criticism, (3) that if once assistance is given political and other considerations will almost certainly compel its continuance * (4) that having regard to tho present views of the Admiralty it would not be easy to maintain the contention that the maintenance of the industry was desirable on defence groundso 8. The Committee are of opinion that if the industryis to be helped, assistance must be given by and through an Admiralty contrast,   justification for special treat-ment being based on the value of the home source of supply in time of war.      In no other way could the case be successfully differentiated from other distressed industry cases,9, It is not at present possible to estimate,  evenapproximately, the annurl sum which would be required t t Iceep the industry in being since the figure must largely depend on the outcome of negotiations between the Admiralty and the Company, and negotiations cannot be began until a decision has been reached&apos; on the question whether State assistance should be given cr not.      F.^r the purposes of this Report the figure may be placed at a sum not exceeding  500,000 per annum-10. The Committee invite the Cabinet;-(1) To decldoirthe question of principle whether special State assistance to be given-by me an-3 of an Admiralty Contract should be4.
entertained in the ease of the Scottish Oil Shale Industry.      If the answer is in the affirmative -(2)    To recommend the Cabinet to authorise theAdmiralty (in consultation with the Treasury,B&quot;)ard of Trade and other Depart merits concerned) to negotiate with Scottish Oils, limited, with a view to the best possible terms being secured, on the understanding, however, that no definite arrangement is concluded pending further can-si deration by the Unemployment Committee and the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the terms and conditions cf the draft contract and of the amount of State assistance involved.Signed on behalf of the Committee.
