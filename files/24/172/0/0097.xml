This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.Printed for the Cabinet, April, 1925.SECRET.Copt No. q Kcp. 197 (35).THE CABINET.SUPPLEMENTARY RESERVE.MEMORANDUM BY THE , SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.A deadlock has arisen between the War Office and the National Union of Railwaymen and the Transport Workers&apos; Union with regard to members of the trade unions joining the Supplementary Reserve.In the recent debate on the Army Estimates, Mr. J. H. Thomas stated the objection of the unions to allowing men to join the Supplementary Reserve so long as this reserve could be used in a period of emergency at home to carry out work which was suspended by a strike. He pointed out that the Supplementary Reserve was not a reserve of ex-soldiers, but was a reserve of tradesmen locomotive and motor drivers, etc. who could not be used in any military capacity, but only in the exercise of their craft, and if so used at home, would necessarily be doing work interrupted by a strike.The Trade Unions ask tor an undertaking that these men shall not be used except overseas.I am advised that we have no power to enlist men for limited service, and if we wished to do so, we should have to create a new force by Act of Parliament.I resisted an amendment to the Army (Annual) Act, moved from the Labour benches, which would have made it illegal to use the Army in aid of the civil power unless a proclamation of a state of national emergency had been issued, and I think it is extremely dangerous to admit the principle that either the Army or any of its reserves may not on the responsibility of the Government of the day be used in aid of the civil power and in extreme cases to maintain national services.The Supplementary Reserve is necessary to provide the tradesmen the Army requires for any large expeditionary force.The alternatives appear to be either to establish by Act of Parliament a reserve of technical men whose only liability is to be called up when warlike operations overseas are in preparation or commenced ; or to proceed with our plans notwithstanding the opposition of the Trade Union leaders.I propose to adopt the second alternative and I expect we shall get the men we require, or a substantial majority of them. The Unions have definitely refused to assist, and they may protest or even try more active measures, but unless my colleagues dissent, I shall proceed.L. W.-E.The War Office,Qth April, 1925.(BJo/17)   100   4/25   w.o.p.   1802
