Public Prosecutions, considered that the existing law is inadequate to deal with reports which unnecessarily encourage familiarity with what ought to be avoided and in consequence take away half the horror of it.    The President of the Institute of Journalists laid stress on the volume of space allotted in some newspapers to these matters and its degrading influence upon the young and impression-able.    The newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association saw no difficulty in giving effect to the provisions of the Bill as drawn.   Moreover the evidence showed that, owing to competition,  the press could not come to any agreement among themselves for eliminating objectionable and unnecessary details.    On the other hand the Kingls Proctor, Sir John Mellor, thought the Bill went too far, and Sir Ellis Hume-Williams, with many years experience of practice in the Divorce Court, advocated no change.    On the whole the Committee came to the conclusion that legislation was needed;    and they suggested some modifications in the terras of the Bill.    The Bill now introduced by Sir Evelyn Cecil is the Bill as recommended by the Select Committee.Resolutions and other information which have reached the Home Office since 1923 indicate that, speaking generally,  the Bill is supported by social workers but opposed by the press and the trades connected therewith on the grounds that it is a slur on the great majority of British newspapers,  that it is an unwise inter-ference with the liberty of the press, that to suppress reports on cases dealing with white slave traffic,  cocaine and other matters in connection with which sex questions arise will play into the hands of guilty persons by keeping their misdoings out of the press, etc., etc.The Second Reading of the Bill is at present blocked by my instructions, but I am being strongly pressed by Sir Evelyn Cecil to allow the Bill to take its chance.    Before, however, I should feel  justified in approaching the Whips on the question of allowing it to reach a Standing Committee, where much time might be spent on it, I feel that I mur.t ascertain the views of my colleagues on the line which should be adopted by the Government towards the general principle of the Bill. -   -l?th March,  1925.
