This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.   -SECRET.Printed for the Cabinet, February, 1925.CP. 113 (25). onCopy No.   ^ 0THE CABINET.THE IMPERIAL WAR GRAVES COMMISSION.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a memorandum prepared by Major-General Sir Fabian Ware, Permanent Vice-Chairman of the Imperial War Graves Commission, in support of the proposal that the present rate of annual contribution of  1,222,800 be continued for 6J years, so that with proportionate contributions by Dominion Governments the cost of completing the memorials and of maintenance during the period may be defrayed, and a capital sum may be accumulated which will provide an annual income of  210,000 to defray the cost of maintenance in perpetuity.I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer objects, and has reduced this year&apos;s estimate by  125,000, the British share of the proposed endowment.I ask that Sir Fabian Ware&apos;s proposal may be approved. In support of my recommendation I would draw particular attention to a telegram which has been addressed to the Prime Minister by Mr. Bruce, the Prime Minister of Australia (Appendix II).L. W.-E.The Wae Office,26th February, 1925.The Imperial War Graves Commission having now reached a stage in their work when they can no longer postpone setting up an establishment for permanent main-tenance, have, after long deliberation, passed unanimously the attached resolution (Appendix I). The Government of Canada has considered the alternative suggestions and Mr. Mackenzie King has cabled to the Canadian High Commissioner as follows :-&quot; Canadian Government considers that cemeteries should be maintained permanently in accordance with general understanding. We are in this connection prepared to endorse creation of trust or endowment fund based on continuing for next six and half years amount of Canada&apos;s appropriation for current fiscal year.&quot;Mr. Bruce, the Prime Minister of Australia, has also cabled to the High Com-missioner for Australia strongly urging the provision of an adequate endowment, which he advocated when in this country in 1923. The British Treasury has however declined to support either proposal and is pressing that the Commission^ Estimate for 1925-26 should be modified accordingly, and ask that the matter should be settled at once.I recommend that the Government adopt the proposal outlined in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s cablegram.The Imperial War Graves Commission are in a unique position ; the Charter they were granted had first been examined, amended and passed in draft, clause by clause, by the Imperial Conference of 1917 ; the cost of their work is borne (under a resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1918) by all the participating Governments in proportion to the number of the graves of their dead ; and the Dominion contributions* have been made on the condition, agreed to by the British Government, that the Commission should administer their own finances with the assistance and advice of a representative of the British Treasury at the fortnightly meetings of the Finance Committee. This clearly represents a new departure in Imperial co-operation, and it has, so far, met with* These have amounted to over  1,000,000 up to date.26/Ptg/364   100   2/25   W.O.P.   1737
remarkable success ; harmony has been maintained among the different interests ami, in comparison with... the. cost :. of. similar services before, they were taken over by the. Commission, very striking economies have been&apos; effected partly, no doubt, owing to the strictness of control essential to meet the criticism of six participating Governments..  .The work of the Commission and the policy which they recommended, which was approved by all the Governments of the Empire, are without precedent. A partial precedent was provided by the American Civil War, when vast numbers of civilians who had not been trained to arms lost their lives in their own country in a struggle which demanded readiness for equal sacrifice from every able-bodied male citizen. But there is no pi&apos;ecedent in history for the two fundamental principles of the Commission^ policy (1) that the dead should not be returned to their families but should remain buried in the countries where they fell, and (2) that the graves of officers and men of all ranks and classes side by side should be treated with absolute equality and marked by the same kind of headstone, the erection of private memorials being consequently disallowed.This policy could only be justified, in particular to those relatives who could have afforded to bring their dead home or to purchase their graves abroad and care for them themselves, if their Governments accepted the responsibility for permanent maintenance.. In defending the Commission^ policy in the House of Commons on the 4th May, 1920, the then Chairman of the Commission (Mr. Churchill) met the point frankly, and&apos;in eloquent and solemn words declared : &quot; The cemeteries which are going to be erected to the British dead on all the battlefields in all the theatres of war, wall be entirely different from the ordinary cemeteries which mark the resting place of those who pass out in the common flow of human fate from year to year. They will be supported and sustained by the wealth of this great nation and Empire,, as long as we remain a great nation and Empire, and there is no reason at all why, in periods as remote from&apos; our own as we; ourselves, are from the Tudors, the graveyards in France, of this Great War, shall not remain an abiding and supreme memorial to the efforts and the glory of the British Army, and the sacrifices made in that great cause.&quot;This pledge has been quoted and re-quoted by the Commission to relatives, a number of whom still ask for the return of their dead. It has been given as an explanation for the removal of graves, against the wishes of the relatives, to sites where perpetual concession of the land could be granted. Every French, Belgian, Italian and American family who have expressed the desire have had their dead returned to them at the expense of their Governments. The Governments of the British Empire decided otherwise on general grounds, and the approved policy will have led, at the end of the allotted 10 years (when the work of construction is completed, the cemeteries built, the graves marked, the names -of&apos;the &quot;missing&quot; inscribed on special memorials)1, to a total expenditure, including the capital sum required, to provide an endowment, of  14,000.000 while, on the other hand, the cost, if the dead had been returned to the relatives who desired it, would not have been less than  30,000,000. It. is not suggested that the Governments were in any way actuated by thoughts of economy when choosing between the two policies, but the fact remains that they adopted by far the less costly, and it is only by carrying it out in its -entirety that they can honestly avoid incurring the greater expenditure.The Commission in their discussions have had to meet the argument that the securing of real and literal perpetuity is impossible ; that is obvious, but what they are asking is that no more should be done by the Governments than the relatives would wish to do for themselves that is, to leave money for the purpose in the belief that posterity will not override their wishes.The Commission feel that there is real and serious danger of a demand for a change of policy, that is to say, for the return of the dead and for the right to erect private memorials, should the public begin to suspect that permanence is not adequately guaranteed.; and they are of opinion that it would be very difficult to resist such a demand.   The costly confusion which would ensue need not be emphasised.It should be remembered that the Commission have successfully subdued al 1 senti-ment that would have led to extravagant treatment of the graves. Their carefully organised and-well balanced system of maintenance is extremely simple, but they have gradually during the last five years won for it the approval of the relatives, whose confidence they enjoy, to an extraordinary degree. They now place their credit with the relatives at the disposal of the Governments they serve, and, on the authority they have established, make a proposal which definitely limits future liability. There are indica--tions and precedents that, if this is not accepted, appeals t8 sentiment in the future wilL surely lead to a more expensive standard of upkeep.
1.LoFinally, it may be observed that under the Charter the &quot; official &quot; members form a majority on the Commission, so that, however provided, the funds at the Commission^ disposal will be controlled by the direct representatives of the Governments who furnish them, so that there need be no hesitation in fixing the endowment at an adequate amount even at the risk of their having, from time to time, to deal with a surplus.APPENDIX I.COPY OF A RESOLUTION passed by the Imperial &quot;War Graves Commission at their 73rd Meeting,held on the 14th January, 1925.7. (1) That the Commission having considered the report of the Finance Committee on the subject of the organisation and establishments necessary for the permanent maintenance of the cemeteries, graves and memorials, and for the carrying into effect of the purposes or of the exercise of the powers of the Commission accept the Finance Committee&apos;s said report and order that it be entered on the Minutes accordingly.(2) That the Commission are of opinion that to ensure the permanent maintenance of their cemetries, graves and memorials on the present accepted standard and in accordance with their policy it is necessary that the annual income of  210,000 referred to in the Finance Committee&apos;s said report be secured to the Commission by the participating Governments either by the provision of an endowment fund to be held by the Commission under the terms .of Part VI, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Charter or by such legislative action on the part of the said participating Governments as may secure effectually to the Commission the said annual income of  210,000.(3) That the Vice-Chairman be authorised in consultation with the Dominion Representatives to take whatever action may be necessary to carry the preceding resolutions into effect. .APPENDIX II.Telegram from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Prime Minister, London.20th February, 1925.Personal. Understand that question of future maintenance of Imperial War Graves will be considered in the near future. I feel very strongly that War Graves Commission should be established on permanent basis and an endowment provided which will. be quite adequate for this purpose. I discussed the matter very fully with Ware while in London and I strongly urge that the views then expressed by me which I understand are the basis of the Commission^ present proposals should be adopted. Would greatly appreciate your sympathetic consideration of the matter and advice as to any development(s).S. M. BRUCE,Prime Minister.
