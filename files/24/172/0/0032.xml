(Intld.)      N.c ministry of Health.March 3rd, 1925.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRXTAKNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET. OHIHBt....--^. -- copy 2lo, tf^WEIR HOUSES. -C.P.132(g&amp;) . 1--&quot;&quot;J--MEMORANDUM   BY   THE   MINISTER OF HBAI/gH.In the absence   of the Secretary of State for India, owing to indisposition,   the Committee on Weir houses has further considered the c iroumatances and has unanimously resolved to recommend the Cabinet to authorise the Minister of Labour to set up the Court of Inquiry which has already been proposed.     It is anticipated that the result of the Court will be to elucidate the actual facts of the position and to make olear the natture of the operations Involved.   But of course these findings will not alter the existing legal position in respect of the Fair Wages Clause, and I desire, therefore, to warn the Cabinet that if the matter is to be carried further we may probably find it necessary to introduce into the House of Commons a fresh resolution modifying the Pair Wages Clause as it stands at present.   I should hope that the findings of the Court would make it easy for us to do this without laying ourselves open to any reasonable suspicion that we are making an attack upon trade unions or trade union standards.     If such a resolution Is passed by the   House of Commons, I should propose to announce that subsidy would be payable in respect of houses constructed in accordance with the revised Fair Wages Clause, whether by local authorities or private individuals.I circulate herewith a letter received from Lord Weir, from which It   will be seen that he is prepared to proceed with the work on which he is engaged in the meantime.
3, ADELHII TERRACE,Copy.- LONDON, W.C.2.28th February, 1925.My dear ChamberlaIn,This morning I had an opportunity of discussing the situation with my partners, and, as promised, I give you our views as briefly as possible in view of your meeting on Monday.Wq are all agreed that the preferential course would be for you to make a definite statement in Parliament that the Government have decided not to allow any interpretation of the Pair Wages Clause to persist which will have the effect of arresting progress in the development of new housing methods, comprising the simplification of operation and the consequent employment of men unskilled in the building crafts and paid at Trade Union rates of wages.     In our view, such action   on your part would not only receive an overwhelming body of support throughout the country, but it is unlikely, as a result, that any-one would raise legal action on the Fair Wages Clause.On the other hand, we admit that there may exist political considerations, the value of which we are unable to appreciate, but which might cause you to strengthen your position by holding an Enquiry before you make your final decision. Accordingly, if you should decide to hold an Enquiry, we are prepared to carry on in the meantime at full speed with our development and administration wox*k in the same spirit as we have done in the past - that of confidence in the national value and justice of our case.Yours sincerely, (Signed)   Weir.he Rt. Hon. Neville Chamberlain-, ! .?*, Ministry of Health, .   Whitehall, -s.w.1. .
