[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1/ /.$&apos; (2fr) j Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.[Circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State&apos;s Instructions.]Letter from Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Sir Eyre Crowe.My dear Crowe, March 7, 1925.MY conversation with M. Herriot was renewed after lunch to-day,&quot; and lasted nearly two hours. He began by thanking me for the frankness with which I had explained to him the position of the British Government, for which he was grateful, however painful it might have been. He had been reflecting upon what I had said, and he had jotted down some points which had at once occurred to him as being vital. First, as I had observed, the Germans had made no mention of the Belgian frontier, but he thought that this omission could not have been intentional, and he assumed that they meant to include the frontier of Belgium in their guarantee. This, I said, appeared to me essential. He then raised the question of Holland, the guarantee of whose territory was equally important to France and Great Britain. It might be worth while to consider whether Holland could not be included in any agreement that we contemplated. He had been somewhat surprised to read in a Dutch paper a statement by a prominent Dutch statesman that Holland would in no circumstances take any part in a pact of mutual defence. In reply to his mention of Holland, I summarised the relevant part of my conversation with Baron van Swinderen, as recorded in my despatch No. 73 to The Hague.M. Herriot&apos;s second point referred to the Rhine. He repeated, with even greater insistence than last night, that no French Government could contemplate as a condition of any pact that the fifteen years&apos;, period of occupation should be shortened. On this subject, he said, some anxiety had been caused to him by the &quot; Balfour note.&quot; At first I could not understand to what he referred, and he himself did not seem very certain, but I came to the conclusion that it was obviously some journalistic reference to the draft despatch on the Geneva Protocol which Lord Balfour submitted to the Cabinet, and I was able to reassure him. I again repeated that Dr. Stresemann had informed Lord D&apos;Abernon that this was not a condition which the German Government proposed.More important was his third point. He was, he explained, seeking tentatively a means of reconciling the British and the French point of view. I had explained to him that we could not make a separate pact with France and Belgium directed against Germany, but could we not begin by agreeing among ourselves on the terms which we might propose to Germany for a quadrilateral pact. Obviously, if the Germans were brought into the negotiations from, the first, there would be great embarrassment in their presence. He could say things to me as an ally that he could not say in the presence of the Germans. He could tell me the grounds for his fears and particularise his fears in a way which would be impossible if German auditors were present. As he developed this thesis at some length, he seemed to me to be edging round tentatively to the proposal that we should conclude, as part of one negotiation, two separate pacts, one Anglo-Franco-Belgian and the other of the three Powers and Germany, but he never expressly stated this, and, when I came to reply, I said that, if his proposal was for conference and agreement among the Allies before we put forward any proposals to the Germans, I was in entire accord with him, but that, if his proposal was for separate pacts, that was not, in my opinion, possible.His fourth point was Poland. He dwelt again on the obligations of France to Poland. On this occasion he went so far as to say that he could believe that the Germans did not mean to renounce all hope of winning back Alsace-Lorraine, but that the more they renounced their hopes in the west, the more certain it was that they would cultivate their hopes in the east, and France could not purchase her own security at the expense of her ally. This is very much what President Doumergue had said to me in the conversation which I had with him this morning. He had said that if the Anglo-American pact had materialised, there would very probably have been no Polish alliance, but France could not remain isolated. She had been forced to make this alliance, and she could not dishonour her word. I said to both the President of the Republic and to M!. Herriot that the undertaking to avoid recourse to war for the realisation of any hopes which Germany might cherish, even in regard.2737 a   [12809 a] b
to. the eastern frontier, was in itself a new.security for Poland, whilst the general appeasement-that, wpuld follow an accord between ourselves and Germany would tend to render more.secure the situation everywhere... Mi. Herriofs fifth point was that of the southern boundaries of Germany. He repeated that if an arrangement were come to in regard to both east and west which made no reference to the south, Austria would be rapidly absorbed. This would not only be a new danger to France, but in particular a great menace to Italy. Germany would be inclined to press forward to Trieste, and he did not suppose that the British Government would wish her to become a Mediterranean Power.The sixth point which ML Herriot had noted was the question whether Germany should be called upon to enter the League before or after the examination of her proposals for a pact. He did not do more than ask the question and, I think, had not himself reached any fixed conclusion on the subject, nor was it necessary for me to express an opinion, but my own view is that it ought to be a condition of the conclusion of the pact that Germany should enter the League. It would no doubt, from many points of view, be desirable that she should take that step in advance of negotiations for the pact.Lastly, Mi. Herriot asked me whether I had observed that Germany was at this moment refusing to conclude a treaty of arbitration with Switzerland.   The refusalgave occasion for thought : What was in Germany&apos;s mind; what motive had she in er refusal? I was able to throw no light on these subjects, for, indeed, I was unaware of the fact; and if we do not already possess information, I should be glad if you would have enquiry made. This concluded all that M. Harriot wished to say for the moment on that subject. He emphasised the fact that there had been no time for consultation with other Ministers; that the views which he expressed were purely personal, and that they might not be shared by all his colleagues; and, indeed, he evidently expected strong resistance from some of them to any idea of including Germany in a pact under and conditions whatever.I asked M. Herriot if he had anything to say to me on the subject of Danzig (about which we had exchanged a few sentences before dinner last night), and the patriarchate. He evidently was not prepared to discuss these questions in any detail; he professed agreement with the view I had expressed last night that we should preach as occasion arose moderation on both sides in each of the disputes; in the case of Danzig, proceed as quickly as possible to the delimitation of the port and see whether any means could be found to limit the number of appeals which Were made to the Council of the League. But he was evidently content to leave this matter to be treated with me by M. Briand at Geneva. In regard to the patriarchate, he doubted whether the Turks would consent to treat it as anything but an internal question. He was inclined to think that the best thing for Greece would be to remove the patriarchate to Athens, for, after all, even if the present difficulty at Constantinople were tided over, the position of the patriarchate, which, in the eyes of the Turk was a Turkish institution, and in the eyes of the Greeks a racial headship, would be certain to involve further difficulties at a later time. From conversations that he had had with Politis and other indications of the views of the Greek Government, he thought that they were not unfavourably inclined towards this solution.M. Herriot then invited me to speak of the question of Cologne. I impressed upon him with the utmost earnestness our view that the Germans should be admitted to a meeting with the Allies. I told him that, in deference to him, I was willing to waive my great wish that the demands should be handed to the Germans across the table, provided that, in return for this concession, he would meet me by consenting that, when the note was presented in Berlin, it should be accompanied by a statement that we were ready to receive them. On this point I found him very difficult. He dwelt upon the great difference which exists between the circumstances of the demands which we are now making and of the negotiations that were necessary to secure the adoption of the Dawes Report. In the latter case, of course, new conditions, not contemplated by the treaty were accepted by Germany. That could only be done by negotiation and agreement, but, in this case, there was no question of Germany undertaking new obligations, but only of the fulfilment of old ones. He did not desire &quot; un dictat,&quot; of which the Germans were always talking. What he wished was &quot; un constat.&quot; All we had to do was to establish that here were certain obligations which were unfulfilled, the fulfilment of which was necessary bcfpre&apos; Cologne could be evacuated. He repeated that he did not exclude the idea thai the Germans might be admitted to make observations at some time, but he obviously felt that my proposal would place him in a position of great difficulty with French public opinion.   I could push him no further for the time being, but I left
6 Lhim under no doubt as to the importance which I attached to this procedure. M. Herriot then developed a long argument upon : the i n ter-c lonnection bet ween security and evacuation. He dealt with the Anglo-American guarantee pact, and the framing of articles 428 and 429 of the Treaty of Versailles, and of the concluding words of that section. It was not, to me, very logical or very clear, all the more so as he accepted the British thesis that, legally, the two questions were distinct and that the question of evacuation must be decided in the terms of the treaty. But what was significant was that, even while admitting this, he could not separate the two questions for a moment in his mind, that he said to me plainly what I have always suspected was at the bottom of his mind, that he would have juridical justification for remaining in Cologne to all eternity because the terms of the treaty never would be fulfilled and never could be enforced. He asked me, therefore, whether our discussion as to security and the German memorandum could not proceed simultaneously with our discussions about Cologne. I said that I should report to my colleagues the points to which he had already drawn my attention, and we would proceed at once with their study; that I hoped on his side he would enter into a careful examination of the possibilities with his colleagues and would let me know, for the consideration of the British Cabinet, the conclusions at which they might arrive. I was quite prepared to press the urgency of the question, and to do my best to deal with it as rapidly as possible, for I said that what I feared was that if France insisted upon maintaining the occupation of Cologne on grounds which appealed to British public opinion frivolous or unimportant, that opinion might make it impossible for us to remain alongside of them. Should that happen, it would be indeed a disaster for both of the countries, from which their relations might not recover, and it would be no less disastrous for the peace of Europe. I pointed out that if we continued to act together in regard to Cologne, our troops would still stand alongside the French and Belgians in the rest of the occupied area, no blow could be struck by Germany against the French where the British troops would not be in the forefront of the battle, and, so long as we were together on the Rhine, France could never be isolated. I called his attention also to the terms of article 44 of the Treaty of Versailles, which provides that if Germany violates in any manner whatever the provisions for the demilitarised area it should be regarded as committing a hostile act against all the Powers signatory of the treaty; and I observed that he had there a most formidable guarantee for the security of France. I frankly could not share his apprehensions for any immediate or early date, but we could not hold Germany down tor ever, and our object ought to be to bring about such a change in the situation that by the time that Germany might really have become dangerous again she should enjoy sufficient well-being and have travelled too far away from the bitter thoughts of to-day to care to risk what she then possessed on the chance that she might recover what she had lost in 1914. This argument was in reply to M. Herriofs repetition of his profound mistrust of the German and his insistence on that factor of their psychology which leads them always to speak like masters or servants, and which he alleged rendered a conciliatory attitude with them perhaps less wise and less likely to be fruitful of good results than with other nations. I asked M. Herriot to consider whither any other course would lead to. I observed that France could, of course, hold Germany under the yoke for many years, and could place her foot on Germany&apos;s neck. M. Herriot at once interrupted to say that nothing could be further from his thoughts. He had shown his peaceful disposition in consenting to evacuate the Ruhr; he had risked a great deal, when a young Minister just arrived in power, to carry through the London Conference; and he had never contemplated such a policy as I was sketching, and could not let those phrases pass.Upon the whole he was calmer this morning than last night, but he looked tired and ill, and was indeed suffering acute pain from a sudden attack of rheumatism in the knee of his good leg. Finally, we agreed on the terms of the communique which you will have already seen. He may perhaps have more to say to me on my return, and we must set to work through aoftbassadorial channels to see how and in Avhat way we can arrive at agreement among the Allies. He knows now the limits within which we think it is possible for us to co-operate, and in the course of my conversation with the President of the Reoublic this mornine; I explained them equally clearly to him. M. Doumergue seemed to me not unhopeful. He Avas particularly anxious to impress upon me the peaceful disposition of the French. He himself was the first to allude to the conversation with Lord Grey of which Tyrrell had spoken to me, and this gave me the opening for explaining the Cabinet decision. There Avas nothing really of consequence, in what he said to me which is not covered by this letter.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.
