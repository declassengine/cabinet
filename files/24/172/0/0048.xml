FThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 148 (25).CABINET.THE DOMINIONS AND THE COLONIAL OFFICE.Proposals for Reorganisation.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.AN essential condition of Imperial unity to-day is the full recognition of the demand of the Dominions to be treated as equal in status if not in stature with ourselves as partner nations in the British Empire. Any failure, or even undue delay, in meeting that demand on lines that preserve imperial unity tends to create a demand for the assertion of that status in the direction of a position increasingly approximating to that of foreign nations. On the other hand, any action on our part which gives evidence of a spontaneous recognition of Dominion status, even in small matters, has what to us may seem a quite surprising effect on Dominion sentiment.Few things, in this connection, create more latent resentment in the Dominions than their &quot; subordination &quot; to the Colonial Office. They can never quite forget that their present position was won step by step against the assertion of Colonial Office authority, and, absurd though it may seem to us, are always suspecting the Colonial Office of endeavouring to reassert its old power by some devious scheme to the detriment of their hard-won autonomy. Mr. Mackenzie-King&apos;s speeches and actions continually reveal that attitude. Apart from this purely historical &quot; complex &quot; about the Colonial Office, they keenly resent the name as a badge of subordination, and dislike the idea that the same officials should deal indiscriminately with their affairs and those of the coloured races in the dependencies directly under Colonial Office control.The issue was raised by Mr. Deakin at the Conference of 1907, when he urged that Dominion affairs should not be &quot;jostled in a Department overburdened with administrative work alike and yet different in character.&quot; It was raised again in 1911 by a specific resolution from New Zealand, endorsed by South Africa, urging &apos;&apos; that it is essential that the Department of the Dominions be separated from that of the Crown Colonies, and that each Department be placed under a separate Permanent Under-Secretary.&quot; All the long discussions on constitutional relations during those two conferences were, in fact, really based on the one desire of getting away from the Colonial Office. The practical objections which disposed of the particular proposals for assigning all the Dominions work to the Prime Minister, or for creating a joint Empire Secretariat, did not dispose of the dissatisfaction which underlay those proposals. In 1917 and 1918 the underlying grievance was again ventilated in connection with the question of &quot;channels of communication.&quot; If the matter has not been more vigorously pressed of late it is, I believe, not because the position is less resented, as because the Dominions feel that it is hardly consistent with the principles on which inter-Imperial relations are based to go beyond a certain point in expressing their views as to the internal administrative organisation of another part of the Empire.Meanwhile practically nothing has been done to satisfy Dominion sentiment in this matter. The Colonial Conference was rechristened Imperial Conference in 1907, and of late years a certain number of the more important telegrams to and from the Dominions are headed as being from Prime Minister to Prime Minister. In 1907 also the work inside the Colonial Office was divided to the extent of establishing a separate [12817]
Dominions Department under its own Assistant Under-Secretary. The Dominions work is no longer done by the same subordinates who deal with the Colonies and Protector rates. But both sides of the work are still dealt with indiscriminately by the Permanent Under-Secretary, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State. And if there is, in fact, very little substance in the idea that the attitude of these functionaries in dealing with the Dominions is unconsciously influenced by habits of mind acquired in giving orders to their Colonial subordinates, there is a real and much more serious danger of Dominion problems not getting the thought and attention they deserve from the men at the head of the office compared with the more immediately urgent mass of administrative detail on the Colonial side with which they are continually overwhelmed.This brings me to the practical considerations which reinforce the sentimental demand of the Dominions for the division of the Colonial Office. The work of that office has increased beyond all measure in recent years. On the Colonial side the work in connection with the economic development of our African territories has more than doubled. The general standard, indeed, of what is expected of our Colonial administration not only in regard to trade, but in regard to health, to education, to the active promotion of native agriculture, to transportation, has risen enormously. It is rightly rising all the time,&apos;and all the time demanding more attention and consideration at headquarters. To all this has been added a very considerable additional section of work in the administration of Palestine and Iraq.On the Dominion side the liaison work of keeping the Dominion Governments posted on the progress of foreign and Imperial affairs, on matters arising out of the League of Nations, the discussions of the Committee of Imperial Defence, &amp;o, has grown enormously, and is growing in volume and importance all the time. The Foreign Affairs aspect of the work, indeed, is one where the slightest lack of attention or delay, due to the pressure of other work on the heads of the office, may easily lead to the gravest embarrassments in the conduct both of Imperial and of foreign policy. A new Dominion, the Irish Free State, with problems all its own, has been added to the work of the Dominions Department in the last two years. Lastly, a whole additional Department, requiring not only a considerable permanent staff, but the constant supervision and intervention of a Ministerial head capable of carrying on negotiations with the Dominions, has come into being in connection with Empire Settlement. The development of that most important work, which in most of the Dominions is in charge of a substantive Minister, has suffered seriously, owing to the fact that it has never had more than the merest fraction of the time of an overworked jtuYs.br Minister, usually not even connected with the Department to which the Oversea Settlement Office belongs.I have no hesitation in saying that one Secretary of State with one Parliamentary Under-Secretary and one Permanent Under-Secretary are quite incapable, under present conditions, of coping adequately with the two great fields of work which are at present lumped together in the Colonial Office.There is an additional reason for increasing the staff for dealing with the work now done by the. Colonial Office. That is the necessity for keeping the office in direct personal touch both with the Dominions and also with the work in the Colonies and Protectorates. It is most desirable that the Secretary of State should visit at least one of the Dominions every year; the assumption that all the travelling should be done by the Dominion Ministers when consultation is required is just one of those things which offend their sense of what is implied in equal partnership. It is no less important that some Minister should frequently see for himself the work in the Colonies. All this is obviously impossible under present conditions.A reorganisation which will strengthen the office at the top is urgently needed on practical grounds of the efficient conduct of the work, quite apart from the considera-tions of Dominion sentiment which call for a clearer separation of their affairs from the control of the &quot;Colonial&quot; Office. On the other hand, there are considerable practical objections to the creation, ; under present conditions at any rate, of an entirely separate Dominions Office with a separate Secretary of State in a separate building, or to the combining of such a separate office with some other office, such as that of Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary or President of the Council. There are many kindred questions which will always, I think, make it desirable that the Dominions and Colonial Offices should keep in close contact. The existing Colonial Office Library and Legal Department are of equal service to both, and could not be divided without unnecessary inconvenience or expense. The present building can, though not without great difficulty, house the essential staff.
The proposal which I therefore submit to the Cabinet is that, while the Dominion view should be fully accepted by the creation of a separate Secretaryship of State for Dominion Affairs and of a Dominions Office, the practical aspect of the case should be met by continuing to vest the new Secretaryship in the same person as the Colonial Secretaryship and by retaining the Dominions Office for internal administrative purposes as a part of the Colonial Office.The actual changes involved would only be two. The first would be the appoint-ment of an additional Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State to deal with Dominion affairs and to act as Chairman of the Oversea Settlement Committee. I regard this addition as urgently required in any case. The present Parliamentary Under-Secretary does not attempt, overloaded as he already is with Colonial questions, to touch these matters, and it is quite impossible for me to attempt to give effective direct supervision to the important work of Empire Settlement. The additional Under-Secretary would naturally be in the House of Lords, and this would get over the present unsatisfactory arrangement by which a junior Minister in an entirely different office has to try and keep in touch with Dominion and Colonial affairs.The second change- would be the appointment of an additional Permanent Under-Secretary, so as to enable each side of the work to be directly in charge of a man of first-class ability and of the right temperament It is necessary to remember that the Dominions and Colonial work are essentially different in character, as different as the work of the Foreign Office from that of the Admiralty. The Dominions work is entirely political and diplomatic. The Colonial&apos;work is administrative and directive. The one calls for great insight and infinite tact. The other for initiative and drive. Even if the volume of work were not, as it is, far too much for one man, it would be practically impossible to find the man who would be equally good in both capacities. Moreover, wherever administrative and policy work are thrust upon the same person, the thinking ahead of policy always tends to get neglected and thrust aside for the mentally easier and more urgent administrative decisions. It is this fact which really underlies the profound objection of the Dominions to the idea that any official who deals with Colonial affairs should deal with them.Under the proposed arrangement the control of the Colonial Office as an office would remain vested in the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Permanent Under-Secretary for Dominion Affairs would direct the work of his own subordinates, but not be otherwise responsible for the conduct of the office. His position would, in fact, in this respect resemble that of the Chief of Staff in the Service Departments. This appears to me the natural arrangement in view of the fact that the staff on the Dominions side is much smaller, and also that the qualities required in its permanent head are not administrative but political.I am advised that no legislation will be required to issue a new patent for the proposed Secretaryship of State for Dominion Affairs or to carry the other changes into effect. Nor is any serious expenditure involved. The total cost of the additional Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and Permanent Under - Secretary, with consequential expenditure on secretarial staff, should not exceed  6,000 a year. The amount required could be set down as a Supplementary Estimate in order to enable the new development to be fully explained to Parliament.I venture to urge these proposals very strongly upon my colleagues. I believe that they will not only greatly increase the efficiency of the work both on the Dominions and on the Colonial side, but that they will have a great effect on public opinion in the Dominions as a spontaneous recognition on our part of the new status of the Dominions in. the Empire.L.
