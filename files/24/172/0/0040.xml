GUARANTEE UNDER THE TRAPS FACILITIES ACTS A LOAN &quot;ffOR THE COMPLETION Off THE BENGUELLA&quot; RAILWAY.Note by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. &apos;I. circulate for the information of my colleaguesa memorandum setting out the views of the Colonial Office in regard to the grant of facilities under theterms of the Trade Facilities Act, in connection with the completion of the Benguella Railway.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a iaemorandumcirculated on this subject, CP. 137  (25),  states that I feel that serious difficulties attach to the granting of facilities:     and I consider it expedient that Ishould explain clearly the nature of those difficultieswhich personally I regard as very serious.L.  S. A.Colonial Office,6th March, 1925.
The Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee have had before them the question of guaranteeing a loan for thecompletion of the Benguella Railway.      This project contem-plates the construction of a line from Lob it o B&apos;;y on the coast of Angola (Portuguese West Africa) to the centre of theKatanga district of the Belgian Congo,      The total length ofthe line, when completed, would be some 1,230 niles,  of wbichPortuguese territory,  and 430 through some 000 would run through/Belgian.      The Bnnguella RailwayCompany are responsible for the construction of the line fromLobito Bay to the Angola-Congo border,  in which section about half the line has so far actually been built.      The BelgianGovernment on their side are under a signed contract tocomplete their line to a point  on the Angola-Congo border onthe same day as that on which the line from Lobito Bay reachesthat point.    The terms of this engagement are, however,  opento revision in 1930.      In the meantime the Belgian Governmentare engaged in building a Railway from Katanga to the Northwhich will provide am alternative route to the seaboard.In 1921 Mr. Robert Williams,   (the Managing Directorof the Bengiiella Railway Company and Tanganyika ConcessionsLimited) applied for a British Government guarantee for thesum needed to complete his part of the line, but the applicationwas rejected,      A similar application for a guarantee of 3,000,000 was made to the Trade Facilities Act AdvisoryCommittee in 1922,  and again, although the Committee were disposed to look upon it favourably,  it was eventually refusedon the advice of the Colonial Office.      In adopting this attitude, the Colonial Office was guided mainly by the advice of General Smuts and by that of the Directors of the RhodesianRailways.The question has now been raised again by Mr. Robert Williams as a result  of the receipt of an intimation,  in reply to his renewed enquiries, that the new Union Government had no objection to the Committee financing the Railway.      On this
point it may be explained., however,  that tho Union Governmenthave intimated confidentially to the High Commissioner for tho Union that in view of the necessity of maintaining friendly relations with the Portuguese (upon whom the Union depend to a substantial degree for tho supply of native labour for the Mines), the Union Government did not like to continue actively tc oppose a proposal in which the Portuguese might well be regarded as being interested.    At the same time,  they expressed the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not fail to safeguard the  interests of the Union and Rhodesia.    This makes it clear that although the Union Government no longer openly oppose the grant of a guarantee, they have no desire to see tho Trade Facilities Act made use of for the benefit of the Benguella Railway.The Directors of the Hhodesian Railways are still strongly opposed to the grant of a guarantee as are also the Southern Rhodesia Government.    A full explanation of their views is contained in the attached memoranda.It will be seen that the Rhodesian Railways do a profitable business in the carriage of coal and coke to Katanga northwards from Fankie in Southern Rhodesia, and inthe carriage of copper and other traffic from Katanga to BeIra.      This business enables the Rhodosian Railways to give facilities to Northern and Southern Rhodesia, which could not otherwise be afforded..     Any substantial diminution of these facilities woixld react very gravely on the interests both of Southern and of Northern Rhodesia.      It is not disputed that the Benguella Railway will in course of time be carried to Katanga, whether a guarantee is given or not, but the completion of tho project must necessarily result  in serious prejudice to the Rhodesian Railways and the British countries which they serve.      In the  circumstances it is submitted
that tho opposition of the Rhodesia Railways and the Government of Southern Rhodesia to the grant of a guarantee is well founded *It is realised that if a guarantee were granted a large sum of money might he expended in this country which would help unemployment.    It should be noted; however, that at present quite apart from any expenditure in this country by the Union Railways^ the Rhodesiah railways disburse annually in this country  734,000 in interest and between  200,000 and  300,000 a year in purchases of stores and rolling stock.   Any action tending to depreciate the Rhodesian Railv/ays would necessarily react on the expenditure which they would be able to incur in this country for stores, rails,,  etcIt would be embarrassing in any event for His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt a course which would be viewed unfavourably in the Union, and there are serious constitutional objections to their embarking on a policy which is strongly opposed by the Government of Southern Rhodesia on the ground of the serious reaction of that policy on the internal affairs of Southern Rhodesia.      Southern Rhodesia is itself a tiolony which gives substantial preference to British Imports. Further there are certain special considerations which restrict our liberty of action in such a matter.When Southern Rhodesia was granted self-government in 1923, His MajestyTs Government felt it necessary to insist on the insertion in the Constitution Letters Patent of provisions for the protection of the local Railways^  and it would be difficult to reconcile this action with the proposal to assist a competing line through a foreign country.      The position of His Majestyls Government vis-a-vis tho Rhodesian Railways is no less difficult.    The protective provisions in the Con-stitution of Southern Rhodesia are repeated in those of
Kortherh Rhodesia with the addition of safeguards in the matter of competition from new Railways within the Protectorate itself.      The provisions on this point form part of an agroo-ment between the Crown and the British South Africa Company of the 29th of September 1^23,   (Cmd.1984). of which the following is the felevant clause :-&quot;(K) The. CroWh recognising that the Company is entitled to protection in view of the magnitude of the investment made by It in the Railways already constructed in Northern and Southern Rhodesia and of the very heavy burden of financial obligation assumed by it in guarantees which it has given to the Debenture holders of the Railway Companies operating in Northern and Southern Rhodesia undertakes(jL ) That in any instrument providing for the future Government of Northern Rhodesia a measure of protection shall be granted to the Railways Companies operating there no less effective than that given to the Railway Companies in the Southern Rhodesia Constitution letters Patent above referred to.(ll)&apos; That no new railway or railways shall be constructed in Northern Rhodesia except under the authority of special-legislation in each case and that such legislation shall not be enacted unless His Majestyrs Government after full consider-ation are satisfied that the new railway or railways to be constructed will not have an unduly adverse effect on the Railway Companies operating in Northern and Southern Rhodesia and that those Companies&apos;are not providing and are not prepared to provide facilities reasonably equivalent to those to be given by such proposed new railway or railways.(Ill)  To accord the most favourable consideration which the public interests will allow to any schemes which the existing Railway Companies may submit for extending their present systems in the Territory&quot;.
Whila it- is true that it could not &quot;be argued by the British South Africa Company that the guarantees given to the Rhodesian Railways in terms preclude His Majesty&apos;s Government from giving financial assistance to the Benguella Hallway it would be wholly inconsistent with the spirit of the provisions for the protection of the Rhodesian Railways inserted in the Southern Rhodesia Letters Patent and the agreement mafia with regard to Northern Rhodesia that His Majesty&quot;s Government should give such assistance to this competing railway.COLONIAL OFFICE.5th Maroh, 1925.
MEMORANDUM from the TRADE FACILITIES ACT ADVISORY COMMITTEE to the COLONIAL OFFICE in reply to the COLONIAL OFFICE letter 3256/25 of 22nd January, 1925.The Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee met on the 2nd February,  1925, Sir Francis Newton,  the High Commissioner for Southern Rhodesia, Sir Henry Birchenough, and Mr. Hawkshaw of the Rhodesian Railways.    Afterwards they mat Mr. Falconer and Mr. Hutohinson on behalf of the Benguella Railway and Tanganyika Concessions..The principal points put to the Committee by Sir Francis Newton, Sir Henry Birchenough and Mr, Hawkshaw wer the followiner:-1.      The Rhodesian Railways recognise that the Benguella Railway will be built some time or other and that when it built they will necessarily lose part at any rate of the copper traffic which they are getting at the present time. If the Benguella Railway is completed with money raised in the ordinary way they will have nothing to say against it since this will be a matter of ordinary business competi-tion such as they are always compelled to face, but they protested most vigorously against the suggestion that the Imperial Government should use its credit to facilitate . the completion of a Railway owned by a foreign company running in foreign territory which in their view will damage the revenues of their railways.2.     The High Commissioner for Southern Rhodesia supported this view on the ground that the oopper traffic at the present, time coming out of iSatanga represents a very large and very valuable part of the revenues of the Rhodesian Railways.    The figures given are as follows:
Gross receipts of the Rhodesian Railways Working expenses8,000.000 .J1,^500^000 3,500,000Net receiptsTotal gross receipts duo to copper traffic up and down 1,250,000of which copper itself is430,000and stores are350,000The Katanga traffic provides, therefore, more than one third of the total gross revenues of the Railways.Owing . to vsrious technical considerations,  however, it provides considerably more than one-third of the total net revenues of the Railways.    It was submitted by Mr. Hawkshaw that the figure so far as net revenue is concerned would be nearer half than one-third.    If, therefore, this Katanga traffic is lost the result will be an increase of rates in Southern Rhodesia and so retard development in that territory.    It was, of course, this point which appeared particulaily important to the High Commissioner for Southern Rhodesia.3.      The Committee suggested that the present financial position of the Tanganyika Concessions group as exemplified particularly by the present quotations for the shares of Tanganyika Concessions Limited (the  1 shares stand at something over  2) made it clear that the group could finance the Railway on their own without any assistance in the -way of a guarantee, and consequently that the railway would be built and built quickly in any event so that the Rhodesian interests if they are going to be damnified by the completion of the Railway will suffer their loss quite irrespective of any Government guarantee.    It was also suggested by the Committee that if a guarantee were given the Benguella Railway would not be in a better position to compete
that if a guarantee were not given;  it was suggested that the net effect to the Benguella Railway of buying expensive British materials with cheap guaranteed money would be very much the same as buying aheap foreign materials with dear private money, and the Committee, therefore, submitted for discussion the suggestion that the guarantee might fairly be given in order to keep the orders for this country.    In reply to this the High Commissioner for Southern Rhodesia and Sir Henry Birchenough both said that Mr. Robert Williams had frequently in the course of the last twenty years deolared his capacity &quot;So finance the completion of the Benguella Railway but as a matter- of fact in twenty years only tbout 600 kilometres had been built and they shewed clearly from their attitude that they were not particularly impressed by the present financial position of the group as revealing their capacity and willingness to finance an expenditure which in all must  ^&quot;esent something over  2,000,000. 4.      The official attitude of the Government Southern Rhodesia can be seen from annexes 1 and 2 consisting of telegrams to and from Salisbury.5.     The repx-esentative3 of the Rhodesian Railways said that they did not find from their own experience that home prices were so materially above continental prices as had been alleged.    They gave examples, particularly of 40 ton steel trucks which could be bought as cheaply in England as abroad.    They also, said that whatever the differences in prices might be they had pursued practically continuously a definite and deliberate policy of buying only in England and that their annual expenditure here was in the neighbourhood of  250,000 to  300,000.    They therefore said that they felt that if there was anything
in Mr. Robert Williams&apos;  contention that foreign prices were very much below British thet they were really entitled to special consideration from the Imperial Government in view of their consistent policy of buying here against their own financial interests and that although they made no request for special consideration they did submit that this policy of theirs ought&apos; to be talten into account when a suggestion was brought forward that the British Government should.use its credit to hurt their interests,The points which were advanced by Mr, Falconer and Mr. Hutchinson were the following: -A,     There was no doubt at all in their minds that they could finance and finance at once the completion of the Railway but if they did so they would buy their materials from abroad and they said definitely that from tenders in their possession it was apparent that foreign prices were 40 per cent below the British.    They said therefore that unless a guarantee were given they would finish the Railway and finish it with Belgian materials.    It was pointed out to them, however, that since they last came to the Committee some three years ago they had built nearly another 200 kilometres of railway and haii usod only British materials although throughout that period British prices had been above foreign and &apos;the Committee therefore expressed some surprise that they shotild now be apparently proposing to depart from what had formerly been their established polioy of buying from this country.    In reply to this they said that they certainly did prefer and always would prefer to buy here rather than abroad and that they had been particularly influenced to continue-to buy from here for their recent construction in the
hope that if they were eventually able to obtain a guaranteed loan the expenditure incurred since they first approached the Committee could be included in the amount of the guaranteed loan.    It was pointed out to them that the Committee could not consider this for a moment.    But, however this might be, they were very definite that if they completed the railway on their own credit they would buy from abroad,B. They suggested that it was unfair to create prejudice against the application by speaking of it as a foreign company operating in foreign territory.    They said that as a matter of fact the work of the Tanganyika Conoessions group in securing a 40 per cent holding in the Union Miniers and thereby keeping for this country a large interest in the biggest copper producing area in the world was really thoroughly patriotic and deserving of Govern-mental support, and they instanced particularly the assistance which the Union Miniere, through their share-holding, had it was; alleged been able to give to the Imperial Government during the War in the w?y of providing -copper when it was urgently required.C. They also submitted that the Rhodesian Railways were showing very bad grace in opposing this scheme in view of the assistance which the Tanganyika Concessions group had rendered to the Rhodesian lailways in building the railway from Broken Hill to Sakania.    Their statement on this point which was afterwards submitted in writingwas as follows:-&quot;As a matter of fact, the British South Africa Company-which controls the Rhodesian Railways, was one of the parties to an agreement made, on the 11th July, 1900, the object of which was to form a company for the purpose of constructing a railway from Broken Hill - the Northern terminus of the Rhodesian Railways -to the Congo Border, and establishing certain arrangements for through traffic, and in that agreement it was expressly provided that it should be terminable on the completion of the Benguella Railway0
. One of the provisions of that agreement was that the British South Africa Company should use their best endeavours to urovide the capital to construct the section of the Hallway which was required to c onnect their existing system of railways to Katanga, but they failed to provide the capital and notified Mr.  vifilliams in a letter of 8th September, 1908, that it was not possible lor them to do so.Mr. Williams thereupon formed the Rhodesia Zatanga Junction Hallway and Mineral Company and by means of. debentures, the interest on which was guaranteed by the Tanganyika Concessions Ltd., for 20 years, provided the ry funds and under arrangement with Messrs,, Pauling &amp; Co., and Messrs. Brlanger oompleted the line. -The Company so formed .took over the. above agreement of 11th July 1908 which contained the express provision ::ith reference to the Benguella Railway above mentioned.The Rhodesia Katanga Junction Railway was thus constructed by Mr. Williams under that agreement, and it does not seem to. be open to the Rhodesian Railways novi to oppose in any way the completion of the Benguella Line&quot;..D. The Concession from the Portuguese Government for the completion of the Benguella Railway expires on 31st December 1926 and unless this concession were renewed it would mean of course that the completion of the Railway would have tobe pressed on with very rapidly.    In view, however, of the past experience and previous renewals of the period of the ooncession there seems no ground for believing that the concession would not again be renewed if necessary.E, In view of existing agreements between the Union Miniere and the Rhodesian Railways it will be necessary for the Union Mini ere to take over the Rhodesian Railways every year up to and Including 1930,130,000 tons of coal and to send 31,000 of copper as a minimum.    The consequence of this will be that the Rhodesian Railways will not immediately lose the whole of their copper traffic.P.       The representatives of the Benguella Railway and Tanganyika Concessions Limited submitted that the Southern Rhodesian Government and the Rhodesian Railways were
making&apos; a mistake in thinking that the ootnpletion of the Benguella Railway would he harmful to their interests. They maintained on the contrary that the completion of the 3?nguella Railway by helping to open up the whole treot of country would really facilitate and expedite development generally and would ultimately result in increased rather than diminished traffic and prosperity for the Railways and Southern Rhodesia,In conclusion the Committee wish to draw attention to two points which  seem well established.I,     That the Benguella Railway Company Limited and the Tanganyika Concessions Limited and their friands and associates could if necessary provide the necessary money to complete the line.Ho    That foreign prices for materials are on the whole considerably below British prices at the present time, particularly as regards steel rails oh which there is a difference of about  2. a ton.    The Committee regard, these two statements as incontrovertible.There are two other statements which the Committee wish to make, which statements, however, can only be treated as probable since they are matters of assumption rather than ascertained facts.    They are:-fa)    The Benguella Railway and the Tanganyika Concessions Limited and their friends and associates have definitely decided to proceed with this construction as rapidly as possible.(b)    If the money is raised without a guarantee the purchases will be made in the cheapest market which will mean that so far as considerable parts of the work are
3rd February,, 1925,oonoerned orders will not coma to this country..    They will probably amount ,.to  1,500,.000 approximate.In conclusion the Committee wish to point out that they have no reliable information as to the attitude of Northern -Rhodesia towards this scheme.      The opponents of the scheme, however, gave the impression that they thought that the Northern Khodesian interests would be generally favourable and in these circumstances the Committee are prepared to accept this statement.

NOTES ON POSITION OF RHODESIA RAILWAY SYSTEM IN-----.----------Kimgrthe; 1 goH6p1 tepprpT-----1. Capital- Invested in the Rhode a lan Railway System:   .&apos; The Capital invested in the Rhodesian system of railways amounts to  19,200,000..    This Capital has been raised without any practical assistance from the Government;   the only aid being a subsidy of  200,000 granted in 1894 spread over 10 years.       This was granted in consideration of the reduced expenditure by the Government on the police and other services in British Bechuanaland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate that would be secured by the construction of the railway, and in particular for the free carriage of mails in perpetuity of the direct value of  4,000 a year.Further, in 1899, when arrangements were being made for the construction of the main linos in Southern and Northern Rhodesia, the Government refused to grant any assistance towards raising the necessar?/ capital.This large capital of  19,200,000, which Includes  15,764,000 Debentures with interest charges of  800,000 a year, was therefore raised under the ordinary market conditions that obtained from time to time.     The railway companies have and can have no objection to the construction of competing lines which are financed under similar conditions, that is at the normal market price of money for such under-takings, but now that they are reaping the reward of their enterprise, it is submitted that Government assistance ought not to be given for a competitive line, the construction of which would Impair the power of the Companies to extend or improve the existing system of Southern and Northern Rhodesia.
m . 203-II , Effect of the Benguella. Line upon Southern and Northern Rhodesia.fApart from the general objection just referred to it is also submitted that the British Government ought not to assist in the construction of this line on account of the probable serious effects on the Colonies of Sodthern and Northern Rhodesia in regard both to their general development and prosperity and to their administrative revenues.The following figures will serve to Illustrate the importance of the Congo traffic to these two Colonies:-The approximate results of the whole Rhodesian system for the year ended 30th September, 1924, w,ere as follows:-Gross Receipts.  3,464,000Working Expenditure 1,945,0001,519,000Percentage of Expendi-ture to Receipts. 56.1This,gross revenue of  3,464,000 includes thefollowing receipts from traffic from the Belgian Congo:-General Goods  350,000Construction Material 80,000Coal and Coke 345,000Copper 430,000 1,205,000It will be seen that the receipts from this Congo traffic represent 34$ of the total gross receipts of the system.The whole system is working on the basis ofexpenditure to gross receipts of 56$;   but In view ofthe fact that the Congo traffic is in full truck loads forlong hauls lending itself to economical working,  it isestimated that it can be worked for 40$ of gross receipts,-18-
which gives a net profit of  723,000 out of the total net receipts of  1,205,000 or nearly half the net earnings of the whole system.The loss of the -revenues derived froin this traffic would be a serious&apos;Injury to Rhodesia, as these territories would Inevitably suffer from the higher railway rates that the railways would have to charge to meet the loss sustained by the deflection of traffic.&apos; Rhodesia at present holds a paramount position in the world&apos;s production of Chrome Ore, carried at very low railway rates, the tonnage exported during 1924 being 125&apos;,..000 tons.     It is also .obtaining an important position in the production of asbestos and 25,000 tons were exported during 1924.     The export during the coming year is valued at  600,000.     Again, the Wankie Colliery In Southern Rhodesia large I7/ depends upon its exports of fuel to the Katanga District.     The tonnage and vaLue of coal and coke sent to the Congo during 1924 was 176,000 tons and  500,000,  forming about 40$ of the whole business of the Colliery.     These and other developing industries would be seriousl7/ jeopardised.In addition there would be the direct loss to the Government of Southern and Northern Rhodesia of the Income Tax payable by the Railways.    &apos; For the year 1924 this amounted to  100,000 -Southern Rhodesia  66,000Northern Rhodesia 34,000Further, the railway companies paid Income Tax in Great Britain in respect of the same year amounting to  50,000.Ill, General Objections to British government assistance.It is submitted that the British Government ought not to assist in financing a railway - passing through a foreign
country to another&apos;foreign country - the construction of which may result in disastrous consequences to the British Territories of Southern and Northern Rhodesia *J&apos;or, if the British Government     guarantees interest and sinking fund on a Debenture Issue in order to build the Benguella line, it will obviously be to its interest to see as much copper and other traffic as possible diverted on to. the new line in order that it may escape being called upon to pay under its guarantee. In fact the British Government will have a direct financial interest in favouring the Portuguese and Belgian line at the expense of the existing British line.Further,  it is represented that the Benguella railway is a somewhat uncertain enterprise for the British Govern-ment to assist.    It is known to the Government that the Belgian Government is now actively engaged upon the construction of an all rail route from Bukarna to Leopoldville, and doubtless the Union Miniere will be strongly pressed by the Belgian Government to favour this route, and as the Rhodesian railway system would also be prepared to oompete for the traffic the future of the Benguella line is by no means assurod or attractive.    On this point attention is drawn to the attached letter of the 1st December, 1921, from the British Ambassador at Brussels to the Foreign Secretary.    Also in March, 1922, M. Franck,  the Colonial Minister of the Belgian Government, after explaining the programme of Belgian railway construction in the Congo declared that -&quot;Another question is to know whether the Benguella railway will have interest to push the construction of its line to the Congo frontier in view of the great competition of the Belgian Congo which it will have to meet.&quot;
IV.    Opnplusiori.it is submitted that the benefit to be derived lay Great Britain from assisting the construction of the Benguella line, namely the placing of orders&apos;for rails and sleepers, etc., would be but temporary and unimportant, whereas the disadvantages would be permanent and serious.The annual purchases in this country of stores and rolling stock for the Rbodesian system amount to between  200,000 and  .300,000 a year, which would be permanently-decreased.    Whereas it is very doubtful whether, after the first orders for construction had been effected, any part of the annual purchases of the Portuguese and Belgian lines would be placed here.The development of the colonies of Southern and Northern Rhodesia would be retarded and their administrative revenues decreased through loss of Income Tax, while the British Government &quot;would also lose Income Tax paid by the Railway Companies, the Wankie Colliery Co., and the Chrome and Asbestos Companies.Finally the British taxpayer might ba called upon to subsidise a foreign railway,  open to severe competition by British and Belgian routes, to the injury of a British route serving British Colonies and Dependencies constructed by British capital held by British taxpayers.-21-

Lippens further declared that the opening of tho branch line from Stanleyville to Kilo in the gold district was as important for the future of the Congo as the line from Katanga to the Lower Congo, and that it was necessary for Belgium to take care that the riches of the Eastern Province should be transported to Belgium by purely Belgian means instead of being carried ovsr lines laid down by peoplas more prompt that the Belgians to carry out what their interests commanded.   Mr. Lippens&apos; speech appears to me to have a distinct bearing on the prospects of the Benguella Railway, the coastal terminus of which is at Lobito Bay.I have,  etc. ,(Signed) GSOHG3 GRAHAMSThe Marquess Curzon of Kedlaston, K.G., etc. , etc.
