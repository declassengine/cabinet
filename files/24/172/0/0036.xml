fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1925.SECRET. Copy No.      38CP. i36 (25).CABINET.PROTOCOL FOR THE PACIFIC SETTLEMENT OF international disputes.Draft Communication to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. (As approved by the Cabinet, March 4, 1925.)Foreign Office,March     , 1925.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have given the most anxious consideration to the Protocol which was provisionally accepted last October by the Assembly of the League of Nations, and submitted by its Council to the various States Members; of the League. It is unnecessary to lay stress upon the sympathy felt throughout the British Empire with any effort to improve the international machinery for maintaining the peace of the world. Arbitration, disarmament and security are the main themes of the Protocol, and on all these great subjects the British Empire has shown, by deeds as well as words, that it is in the fullest accord with the ideals which have animated the Fifth Assembly of the League. Successive administrations in Great Britain, with the full approval of the self-governing Dominions, have not only favoured arbitration in theory; they have largely availed themselves of it in practice. They have not contented themselves with preaching disarmament; they have disarmed to the limits of national safety. They have taken their full share in creating and supporting the League of Nations and the Court of International Justice; while the immense sacrifices they have been content to make in the cause of general security are matters of recent history.If, therefore, His Majesty^psesent advisers, after discussing the subject with the self-governing DominionsjTsee insuperable objections to signing and ratifying the Protocol in its present shape, this is not because they feel themselves out of harmony with the purpose which it was intended to serve, or are opposed in principle to schemes for clarifying the meaning of the Covenant or strengthening its provisions. Amendment and interpretation may in themselves be desirable ; but His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot believe that the Protocol as it stands provides the most suitable method of attempting that task.II.The declared object of the Protocol is to facilitate disarmament, and it proposes to attain this most desirable end (1) by closing certain gaps in the scheme originally laid down in the Covenant for peaceably settling international disputes, and (2) by sharpening the &quot;sanctions,&quot; especially the economic sanctions, by which, under the existing system, aggression is to be discouraged and aggressors coerced. These two portions of the scheme are intimately connected, and it may be desirable on the present occasion to consider them together.It was, of course, well known to the f ramers of the Covenant that international differences might conceivably take a form for which their peace-preserving machinery provided no specific remedy; nor could they have doubted that this defect, if defect it was, could in theory be cured by insisting that every dispute should, at some stage or other, be submitted to arbitration. If, therefore, they rejected this simple method of obtaining systematic completeness, it was presumably because [12792]
they felt, as so many States Members of the League have felt since, that the objections to universal and compulsory arbitration might easily outweigh its theoretical advantages So far as the Court of International Justice is concerned, this view was taken in 1920 by the British Delegation, while the British Delegation of 1924 made a reservation in the same connection which, so far as Great Britain is concerned, greatly limits the universal application of the compulsory principle.Into this branch of the controversy, however. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not now propose to enter. It suffices to say that, so far from their objections to compulsory arbitration being diminished by the provisions of the Protocol, they have rather been increased, owing to the weakening of those reservations in clause 15 of the Covenant, which were designed to prevent any interference by the League in matters of domestic jurisdiction.His Majesty&apos;s Government are now more immediately concerned to enquire how far the change in the Covenant affected by the Protocol is likely to increase the responsibilities already undertaken by the States Members of the League. On this there may conceivably be two opinions. Some have held that, although in the language of the First Committee (p. 7) &quot;there are numerous fissures in the wall of protection erected by the Covenant round the peace of the world,&quot; there is in fact but little danger that through these &quot; fissures &quot; any serious assaults will be attempted. The changes made by the Protocol are, in their judgment, formal rather than substantial; they aim at theoretical completeness rather than practical effect. On this view no material addition is made to responsibilities already incurred under the Covenant, nor (it must be added) is anything of importance accomplished in the cause of Peace and Disarmament.But this (it need hardly be said) is not the view of the framers of the Protocol. They regard themselves as the authors of a &quot;new system&quot; (p. 6) through which alone can be realised &quot; the great ideal to which humanity aspires &quot; (p. 7). The last thing they contemplate is the possibility that their proposals will leave things very much as they stand under the Covenant. And in this His Majesty&apos;s Government are entirely of their opinion. How, indeed, can it be otherwise? Fresh classes of disputes are to be decided by the League; fresh possibilities of defying its decisions are thereby created; fresh occasions for the application of coercive measures follow as a matter of course; and it is therefore not surprising that, quite apart from the problem of disarmament, the question of &quot; sanctions &quot; should be treated at length in the clauses of the Protocol.III.It seems necessary to preface the comments called for by this part of the new scheme by recalling certain historic facts which, though very relevant to the subject, are never referred to in the documents by which the Protocol is justified and explained.As all the world is aware, the League of Nations, in its present shape, is not the League designed by the framers of the Covenant. They no doubt contemplated, and, as far as they could, provided against, the difficulties that might arise from the non-inclusion of a certain number of States within the circle of League membership. But they never supposed that among these States would be found so many of the most powerful nations in the world, least of all did they foresee that one of them would be the United States of America.It is no doubt true that there are many points of view from which these unfortunate facts have not proved to be of vital importance. The work of the League goes on, beneficent and full of promise. Though the United States remains in friendly aloofness, individual Americans have freely helped both by sympathy and service, while the generosity of the American public has greatly aided some causes in which the League is deeply interested. Could, therefore, attention be confined to the present and the past, it might be said with truth that the problems which even&apos;a weakened League has had to face have never overstrained its machinery.The hope may be justified that this good fortune will continue. But surely it is most unwise to add to the liabilities already incurred without taking stock of the degree to which the machinery of the Covenant has been already weakened by the non-membership of certain great States. For in truth the change, especially as regards the &quot;economic sanctions,&quot; amounts to a transformation. The &quot;economic sanction,&quot; if simultaneously directed by all the world against a State which is not itself economically self-sufficing, would be a weapon of incalculable power. This, or some-thing not very different from this, was the weapon originally devised by the authors of the Covenant.   To them it appeared to be not only bloodless, but cheap, effective
and easy to use, in the most improbable event of its use being necessary. But all this is changed by the mere existence of powerful economic communities outside the limits of the League. It might force trade into unaccustomed channels, but it could hardly stop it; and, though the offending State would no doubt suffer, there is no presumption-tion that it would be crushed, or even that it would suffer most.Were this the occasion for entering into a detailed discussion of the subsidiary provisions of the Protocol, it would be necessary to dwell at length on all those which, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, are open to serious objection. But for the purposes of the present communication the following observations may suffice.Articles 7 and 8 of the Protocol are designed for the purpose of preventing a State which has a difference with a neighbour from making any preparations for war between the moment when a dispute arises and the moment when proceedings for a pacific settlement have been concluded. The intentions of these provisions are most laudable. But its framers have not perhaps sufficiently considered that it may embarrass the victim of aggression even more than the aggressor. The aggressor is at liberty to select his own date for picking a quarrel. Until that date arrives he may distribute his armies as he pleases provided only that he neither mobilises them nor adds to them: When the distribution is as favourable to his designs as he can hope to make them, he starts the dispute. Immediately the military position becomes temporarily unalterable. His troops, which are more or less in the right position for attack, may (indeed must) be kept there till he wants to use them. The troops; on the other hand, of his prospective victim are (by supposition) in the wrong position for defence. But there they must be kept, or the victim may find himself charged with a breach of the Protocol. Is this a tolerable situation ? Is it one that could possibly survive the day of trial ?.It may be replied that if the aggressor attempts to concentrate troops for attack before the dispute arises, means may be found to stop him. Grant that such means exist, which is extremely doubtful, how does the Protocol deal with the case where the peace distribution of the troops belonging to the aggressor is normally more suitable for attack than the peace distribution of the troops belonging to its opponents are suitable for defence ? If a dispute were to arise, would the defender be counted as an aggressor solely because he endeavoured to redress this accidental inequality ?These are some of the difficulties suggested by Articles 7 and 8 of the Protocol as these affect forces on land. But these articles raise even more embarrassing problems when applied to the case of forces at sea. The whole value of a fleet depends on its mobility. Its distribution is in all probability quite different in time of peace from what it would be under threat of war. To suggest that directly a dispute arises, which in any way concerns a maritime power, its ships are to remain immovably fixed on the stations where the chance conveniences of peace may happen to have placed them, is asking the threatened State to make a surrender of its inalienable right of self-defence, to which it is never likely to submit.It may be desirable to add that, besides the obvious objections to&apos; those clauses already indicated, their great obscurity, and the inherent impossibility of distinguishing, in any paper definition, military movements genuinely intended for defence, and only for defence, from movements with some ulterior aggressive purpose, must always make them a danger to the unwary rather than a protection, to the innocent.   They could never be accepted as they stand.There is one other clause in the Protocol which cannot be passed over in complete silence, namely, clause 15.This contains two provisions. By the first, the aggressor State is required to pay all the costs of the war for which it is responsible, and full reparation for all damages, public or private, which the war has caused. By the second, it is protected from any alteration of its frontiers and all interference with its internal affairs.With the sentiments which have dictated these two provisions there will be general sympathy. His Majesty&apos;s Government, at all events, have no desire to relieve the aggressor of the duty of repairing to the utmost of his ability the damages for which he is responsible; they hold strongly to the view that frontiers are neither to be lightly made nor lightly violated; and they, of course, accept the broad principle that sovereign States should be left to manage their own affairs. But they cannot think it wise to embody these generalities in dogmas of inflexible rigidity, designed to control the actions of the League in all circumstances and for all time. In the sternest codes of law mitigating circumstances are allowed to modify the judgments of the courts; and His Majesty&apos;s Government fail to see why the League of Nations should deliberately deprive itself of a discretion which all other tribunals are free to exercise.r&apos;12792j
Moreover, there is a certain want of harmony between the two provisions of the Article, which in rare arid extreme cases (and it is for rare and extreme cases, among others, that we are asked to legislate) might well shock the consciences of the world. These cases cannot, indeed, be foreseen, but they may be imagined. Is it impossible (for example) that in a war arising out of some very complicated situation, involving perhaps a State not a member of the League, the guilt of the combatants might be fairly matched, though only one of them was technically the aggressor ? In such circumstances, would the League feel no misgivings when they found themselves compelled to throw all the cost of the war upon one party and none at all upon the other ? Would not the universal verdict be that, under the first half of Clause 15, .the aggressor had in this case been hardly treated?But now consider the second half of Clause 15. This protects the aggressor, whatever his misdeeds, from losing anything under any circumstances but money or the equivalent of money. Is this quite satisfactory ? The aggression may have been utterly unprovoked; it may have been barbarously conducted; it may be the work of a corrupt and tyrannical administration; and it may be the inevitable result of cruel mis-government on the aggressor&apos;s side of an ill-drawn frontier. Are we to lay it down for all time that, in such&apos;a case, the League shall do nothing to prevent a repetition of the offence, but ask for money ? This may, indeed, be all that is possible. But would it not be wise to let the League itself resolve this problem, if unhappily the occasion should ever arise ?There is one general reflection which His Majesty&apos;s Government venture to add to the specific criticisms they have made in the preceding paragraphs. The Protocol purports to be little more than a completion of the work begun but not perfected by the authors of the Covenant. But surely this is a very inadequate description of its effects. The additions which it makes to the original document do something quite different from merely clarifying obscurities and filling in omissions. They destroy its balance and alter its spirit. The fresh emphasis laid upon sanctions; the new occasions discovered for their employment; the elaboration of military procedure, insensibly suggest the idea that the vital business of the League is not so much to promote friendly co-operation and reasoned harmony in the management of international affairs, as to preserve peace by organising war, and (it may be) war on the largest scale. Now it is unhappily true that circumstances may be easily imagined in which war, conducted by members of the League, and with its collective assistance and approval, will become a tragic necessity. But such catastrophies belong to the pathology of international life, not to its normal condition. It is not wholesome for the ordinary man to be always brooding over the possibility of some severe surgical operation; nor is it wise for societies to pursue a similar course. It is more likely to hasten the dreaded consummation than to hinder it. And it certainly seems to His Majesty&apos;s Government that anything which fosters the idea that the main business of the League is with war rather than with peace, is likely to weaken it in its fundamental task of diminishing the causes of war, without making it in every respect a satisfactory instrument for organising great military operations should the necessity for them be forced upon the world.IV.It may perhaps be urged that these objections to the Protocol, whatever be their value, are far outweighed by the blessings of the disarmament which would immediately follow its acceptance. But why should disarmament immediately follow its acceptance? Why should the new scheme succeed when the old scheme has so lamentably failed? it no doubt claims to have closed some &quot;fissures in the wall of protection erected by the Covenant &quot;round the peace of the world.&quot; But it is not the possibility of an attack through these (alleged) weak places in the Covenant which haunts the imagination of those who hesitate to disarm. They do not doubt that the Covenant, if kept, would be sufficient to protect them, at least from attack by those who have signed it. What they doubt is whether, when it comes to the point, the Covenant tvill be kept. Either some faithless member -of the League will break its pledges, or some predatory nation outside the League will brush Covenant and Protocol ruthlessly aside, defying all the sanctions by which they are protected. Brute force is what they fear, and only brute force enlisted in their defence can (as they believe) give them the security of which they feel the need.His Majesty&apos;s Government fail altogether to see how this situation is bettered by the Protocol. Is it to be&apos;supposed that the &quot; security &quot; promised by the new system will be so complete that no armaments capable of being used or improvised for
offensive purposes will remain in being ? If not, is the balance of power between, the States who desire peace and those who are plotting war to be adjusted in favour of the former ? If so, on what principle ? If not, then how are we advanced? How will the unscrupulous aggressors be relatively weakened? How will their potential victims be rendered more capable of defence ?And if the particular case of aggressors who are outside the League be considered, is not the weakness of the Protocol even more manifest ? The -aggressors within the League are traitors in the sight of all mankind. Their moral position in the face of any opposition within their own borders will be immensely weakened, while in neutral countries they will find none to plead their cause. However low the practical importance of moral considerations such as these may be rated, the eagerness of competing propaganda in times of international crisis may convince the most cynical that a good cause counts at least for something. If so, aggressors outside the League will have a smaller load of infamy to carry than aggressors within it, and will be by so much the more formidable. How does the Protocol deal with them ? It requires them to treat the situation as if they were members of the League, to accept its methods and conform to its decisions. If they refuse they are counted as aggressors, they become the common enemy, and every signatory State is bound to :go to war with them. They may be in the right and have nothing to fear from impartial judges. Yet national pride; in some cases perhaps the sense of power; dislike of compulsory arbitration; distrust of the League (to which presumably they have already refused to belong)- all these motives, or any of them, may harden their objections to outside interference. If so, the Protocol, designed to ensure universal peace, may only extend the area of war a possibility which, if realised, will not improve the chances of general disarmament.v.It may perhaps be replied that, while every scheme of sanctions is open to criticism, some scheme of sanctions is certainly necessary. Without it a League of Nations would be as insecure as a civilised society without magistrates and police. International engagements which cannot be internationally enforced are little better than a sham. Those, therefore, who object to the plan proposed in the Protocol are bound to suggest a better.To this challenge His Majesty&apos;s Government might be content to reply that as between the Covenant unamended and the Covenant amended by the Protocol they have already given reasons for preferring the former. But they are unwilling to conclude their argument.on a purely critical note; and though they cannot believe that &apos;&apos; security&apos;&apos; can be reached by the route so carefully explored by the first and third Committees of the League in 1924, they are willing to consider whether some approach to it may not be made from the side unsuccessfully attempted in 1923.They do not agree indeed that without &quot; sanctions &quot; the League is powerless and treaties no better than waste paper. Doctrines like these seem to them not only mischievous, but self-contradictory. Every &quot;sanction&quot; referred to either in the Covenant or the Protocol depends on treaties; and if no treaties are of value, all sanctions must be worthless. Do what we will, we have no choice but, in the last resort, to depend upon the plighted word.But this, it must be admitted, does not settle the question whether the sanctions contemplated by the Covenant cannot in certain cases, and for certain purposes be supplemented with advantage to the general scheme of the Covenant itself. That scheme may no doubt be trusted in ordinary cases to work smoothly and effectively. The mere threat to employ sanctions will commonly suffice. And if, unfortunately, it does not, their effect, when put into operation, will doubtless be speedy and conclusive. But it is easy to imagine extreme cases, about which we dare not speak with the same assurance; and it is precisely the possibility of these extreme cases, remote though that possibility may be, which fosters international suspicion, makes Governments hesitate to disarm and keeps the world on edge.His Majesty&apos;s Government do not share these alarms, but they recognise their serious effect, and believe them to be the main obstacles to the complete recovery of our shaken civilisation from the disasters of war.  How are they to be allayed ?The first expedient that naturally suggests itself is to strengthen the provisions of the Covenant. If the Covenant, as it stands, does not supply an adequate machinery for preserving peace in all conceivable cases, why not alter it till it does ?
The futility of this plan is, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government,, abundantly proved by the Protocol.  For whatever else its proposals give us, they da not give us security.   They multiply offences, bait do nothing to strengthen remedies. They increase the responsibilities undertaken by individual members of the League, but do nothing to readjust their burden.What expedient remains? How is security, and, above, all, the feeling of security, to be attained ? In answering this question it is necessary to keep in mind the characteristics of the &apos;&apos; extreme cases,&apos;&apos; to Which reference has already been made. The brooding fears that keep huge armaments in being have little relation to the ordinary misunderstandings inseparable from international (as from social) life  misunderstandings with which the League is so admirably fitted to deal. They spring from deep-lying causes of hostility, which for historic or other reasons divide great and powerful States. These fears may be groundless; but if they exist they cannot be effectually laid by even the most perfect method of dealing with particular disputes by the machinery of enquiry and arbitration: Tor what is feared in such cases is not injustice but war- war deliberately undertaken for purposes of conquest or revenge. And, if so, can there be a better way- of allaying fears like these, than by adopting some scheme which should prove to all the world that such a war would fail ?Since the general provisions of the Covenant cannot be stiffened with advantage, and since the &apos;&apos; extreme cases &apos;&apos; with which the League may have to deal will probably affect certain nations or groups of nations more nearly than others, His Majesty&apos;s Government conclude that the best way of dealing with the situation is, with the co-operation of the League, to supplement the Covenant by making special arrangements in order to meet special needs. That these arrangements should be purely defensive in character, that they should be framed in the spirit of the Covenant, working in close harmony with the League and under its guidance, is manifest. And in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government these objects can best be attained by knitting together the nations most immediately concerned, and whose differences might lead to a renewal of strife by means of treaties framed with the sole object of maintaining, as between themselves, an unbroken peace. Within its limits no quicker remedy for our present ills can easily be found, nor any surer safeguard against future calamities.
