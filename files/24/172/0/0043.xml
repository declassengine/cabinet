CHANCELLOR 0 F QBE EXCHEQUER,L OH DON UNIVERSITY., AIIiG&apos;S COLLEGE AND TK4 IMPERIAL INSTITUTE,I think it ia very desirable that the Cabinet should be aware, of a question that arises in connection with the accommodation of London University.This problem seemed in a fair way 4o being solved, when in 1920 the then government bought a site of 11 acres in ploomsbury for  425,000 from the Trustees of the Bedford Estate and placed it at the disposal of London University with a view to (1) the erection thereon of the central buildings of the University (Administration Offices, Library, Hall,etc) and (2) the transfer thereto of King^ College, which now occupies a Crown site in the dtrand adjoining Somerset House.     The Bloomebury site is contiguous to  that of University College Gower Street,  and the   main object of the proposal following a recommendation of the Haldane Commission on London University was the creation of an 1 outward and visible&apos; London University with its two principle teaching Colleges, University College and iLingrs College grouped round it,  the whole forming the nucleus of a &quot;University quarter&quot; in the heart of London.     It was one of the conditions of the transaction as between the Government and the Bedford Bstete that if it was found impossible to employ the site for the purpose of London University before the 1st April 1926 the Trustees should have the right to repurchase the site at the price paid therefor, via;  425,000.The government made it quite clear to  the University . that the offer was limited to the site alone, and that
provision for the new buildings both of the University and of Elng&apos;s College would have to be found from sources other than Votes of Parliament, subject however to a promise that the Government would compensate Aing&apos;s College for the loss of their existing buildings in the Strand.       There was much divergence of opinion within the University as to the advantages of the proposal and it was only after considerable internal debate-and public discussion in the Press that the - Senate of the University in the autumn of 1920 finally accepted the Governments offer, attaching to their acceptance certain conditions^ The purchase of  the site was then completed,,Since that date the difficulties of carrying the proposal into effect,  especially on the financial side, have become increasingly clear.    It has been estimated that the headquarter building of the University would cost  1,000,000 and that a further l,500,000 would be needed to erect a suitable building for x\ing-Is College,     Mo progress was made in raising the necessary money and in March last deputations representative of the Senate of the University and of the Council of *.ingla College attended upon Mr.Snowden and placed before him the facts of the situation and their views as to  the terms upon which the removal should be effected.   As a matter of fact, quite apart from the financial problem it was made evident in the course of the proceedings that there was in the minds of the king&apos;s College authorities a very real doubt as to whether it would be in the interests of the College and of the purposes which in their view it existed to serve, to cut loose from their Strand associations and move- to a new home in -Bloomsbury; and this impression was confirmed in an official letter received from i.ing&apos;s
College dated the 16th Deoember last.Mr.Snowden offered to King&apos;e Collage to ask Parliament to Vote the sum of  570,000 towards the cost of a new King&apos;a College on the Bloomsbux^y site, that sum representing the value estimated by the Valuation Department of the present site and buildings of King&apos;s College.     The College find the offer insufficient and I have no doubt that the only terms on which the scheme could now be carried through would involve the provision by the State of practically the whole of the monies required for the new buildings both of the University and of king College.     This is a course which we ought not to contemplate, both having regard to the doubts entertained by King&apos;a College as to the desirability of the move   from their point of view, and because of its effect on other Universities and Colleges.I believe therefore that we must, however, reluctantly, regard the Eloomsbury plan as having definitely failed and that we must search elsewhere for a solution of the problem of the accommodation of London University.     It is suggested that such a solution might be found In the following direction.As is well known the headquarters of the University have been situated for many years in a portion of the Imperial Institute Building in South Kensington, the external maintenance of which is undertaken by the Office of Works.      The remainder of the building is at present occupied by tho Imperial Institute itself, and the University Offices are, in their portion of the building, seriously overcrowded.     The proposal I have in mind is that the whole of this building should be&apos; handed ova r to
the University;    and that.the Imperial Institute Should he provided, with other and more suitable accommodation elsewhere&apos;.(a) from the point of view of the University the long vexed question of a suitable headquarter buildingproviding adequate apace for any expansion that canbeat present /tore seen would be once and for all settled. In view of its close proximity to the Imperial College of Science and Technology, the Royal School of Mines, the Science Museum, the Natural History Musuum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, the site appears as appropriate as any other for the centre of University work in London.     Moreover I have some reason to believe that the authorities of the University would welcome the proposal, which would provide them with a   stately and adequate building at small expense.(b) As regards the Imperial Institute it wou2dbe idle to disguise the ft. ct that it has up to the present never been successful, and there can be no doubt that in its present situation it is not well placed to fulfil the purposes for which it was founded.     I doubt if the prospects for the future can.be regarded as any brighter, and in my view the only chance of its achieving any success lies in transferring it to start, afresh in appropriate surroundings with a building better adapted for business uses.     The question of situation would be for consideration;    and it/
would of course be necessary to provide a building, but towards this there could be devoted a part of the sum ( 425,000) to be realised by the resale of the Bloomsbury site.(c)     At the same time King&apos;s College could be left to work out its destiny on the site in the Strand with which It has so long been connected:   and a further portion of the proceeds of the resale of the Bloomabury site might be devoted if this were thought desirable to providing for the limited amount of expansion which is considered to be necessary.(d)     Final!y there is no reason why the latter site need be lost to educational purposes.    For it should not be difficult to secure the development thereon of bodies associated wi th the University by making suitable arrangements either with the Trustees of the Bedford  state if they exercise their option to repurchase the site next year, or in the event of their failing to do so with the Commissioners of Crown Lands if the latter take it overQOn these grounds I hope the Cabinet will agree that the scheme merits at any rate close consideration,. But in the meantime 1 understand that it is intended to push on as rapidly as possible with the Imperial Institute Bill, which provides int er alia for the transfer to the new Governing Body which is to be formed, thereunder of that x part of the existing Imperial Institute Building which is occupied by them.    It would be a great pity if, supposing after further examination it is considered desirable to proceed with the scheme I have outlined above, it should then be found impossible to persuade the Governing Body to
part   with the building and I very much hope that before the Bill&apos; ia passed it will be possible to insert an amendment which will enable the Government to take the course I have indicated if it sod ecides.    In any case this is one reason why the suggestion should be explored without delay.I accordingly suggest that you should ask the Cabinet to invite the First Commissioner of Works  (assisted if he so desires by a small Cabinet Committee) to examine the plan from, all points of view, and, if he then regards it as feasible, to draw up definite proposals for putting it or any variant thought preferable into effect;    and that he should have authority to negotiate, through the High Commissioners, with the Governments of the Dominions and India with a view to obtaining their concurrence in the scheme.G.L.B.
