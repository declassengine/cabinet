ANHFX I.OOMCLUSIOHS OF THE COfe&amp;TITTEE OP PgERIAL DEFENCE on APRIL 2, 1925.1* The Coiiaalttee of Imperial Defence recommend that the policy of leaving to the Admiralty, subject to the paramount authority of the Cabinets the responsibility for the naval defence of the Empire on the basis of the one-Power standard, should not be reversed or modified;    Even before the War it was x^ecognised that the two-Power standard did not necessarily imply that our fleets were able simultaneously to deal with the con-centrated fleets of two first-class leval Powers in different quarters of the globe as well as to provide for all other naval requirements.  &quot;This is equally true of the one-Power standard today.     The requirements of a one-Power standard are satisfied if. our fleet, wherever situated, is equal to the fleet of any other nation, wherever situated, provided that arrangements are made from tine to time in different parts of the world, according as the international situation requires, to enable the local 4NMtpL forces to maintain the situation against vital and irreparable damage pending the arrival of the main fleet, &quot;and to give the main fleet on arrival sufficient mobility..2.    The Committee accept the view of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that in existing circumstances aggressive action against the British Empire on the part of Japan within tho next ten yea.rs is not a contingency seriously to be apprehended.The Foreign Office should be responsible for warning the Cabinet and the Oonmittee of Imperial Defence of any change in the inter-national situation in the Far East which would necessitate a fresh review of the question.3.    Although, in accordance with recent decisions, preliminary &apos; ar-raiipeijents to establish docking facilities for our largest shins at Singapore and to develop gfactually the necessary oil fuel installations on our Eastern routes should proceed, there is no necessity, in view of Conclusion 2,to make preparations involving additional expenditure for placing at Singapore for a decisive battle in the Pacific, a British battle fleet with cruisers, flotillas end all ancillary vessels superior in strength, or at least equal, to The sea-going Navy of Japan 4 &quot;
This decision should be reviewed automatically&apos; by the Committee of Imperial Defence ever;/ year, in the light of the international situation.Further, in order that all the data required for a decision nay be readily available In the event of a change in the&apos; situation in the Par East, the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Singapore Sub-Committee should inquire and report as to the preparations which would have to be made if it became necessary to reverse the above decision.To meet the unlikely contingency of war occur-ring before the base at Singapore Is capable of sustaining a British fleet superior to the Japanese&quot;Navy, the Admiralty^should consider in advance what, facilities can be made available from Great Britain or else-where to supplement the facilities which already exist in the Par East.-4-iniiiiiiriiwiBiiimiiiiiniiiniiwiiiiiiiiiiuiiiiiiiiiiii iiii   i minn nn mm i.........r  , i, u
v p **jdo 7mmz ii.QUSSTIOI-iS referred to tps committee OP imperial defgjcf by the oabinbt (Cabinet 16 (25), Conclusion 2. )(a) The policy or leaving- to the Admiralty the responsibility for the Naval defence of the Empire on the basis of the one-Power standard was last reaffirmed by the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1923.Is it proposed to reverse or modify this decision&apos;-5If not, what does it in practice involve?   In what waters are we to be as strong as any other Power?   Do we satisfy the requirements of a one-Power standard if our fleet wherever situate is equal to the fleet of any other nation wherever situate&apos;?(b) Is aggressive action on the part of Japan, such as would tend to involve this country in armed conflict in the Pacific during the next ten years, a contingency so seriously to be appre-apprehended as to impose upon the Admiralty the responsibility of mailing material preparations to meet ita upon the basis *hat we must Inthe Pacific be able to confront and defeat their whole maritime strength?(c) If the decision referred to in question (a) still stands 5 ought the British war plan to contemplate placing1 at Singapore for a decisive battle in the Pacific a British battle fleet with cruisers, flotillas and all ancillary vessels superior.in strength? or at least equal, to the sea--going Navy or Japan?   If so, on what -date could this, or ought it to, be achieved having regard to the strength which must be retained in Borne Waters?(d) In the event of war occurring before the base at Singapore is capable of sustaining a British fleet superior to the Japanese Navy, what ought the interim British war plan to be?(e) If the answers to (b) and (c) are in the negative, what should be the griding principles on which to form a war plan,, with particular reference to the development of the base and the maintenance of fuel and other reserves in the Singapore area?(f) If, on the other hand, the answer to (b) is in the affirmative, and to (c) in the negative, on what principles should the British war plan be based&quot;0
