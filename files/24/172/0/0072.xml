a, n p,abbThis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.CABINET. -j, , --,_ *HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. NIGHT CLUBS BILL. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I ask my colleagues to approve the introduction in the House of Commons of the annexed Bill relating to Night Clubs.It is notorious that there are a number of Clubs, particularly in London, where the law relating to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor is frequently and flagrantly broken,  and alcoholic drinks are provided at exorbitant charges in the small hours of the morning.    The Police are severe^ handicapped in bringing offenders to justice owing to legal and other difficulties in gaining entry, and the sense of the public has been shocked at seeing culprits who are brought to book promptly opening a similar establishment elsewhere,  and defying the law because detection and punishment are small risks in relation to the large and rapid profits of the business.    I feel therefore that the law should be strengthened and that the general public would endorse this view.The establishments in question mostly belong to a generally recognised type and are usually dancing clubs, but it is not easy to devise a satisfactory legal definition of them which would not on the one hand leave easy loopholes for evasion and on the other hand would not include a number of clubs of quite a different kind;    and I am most anxious not to interfere more than absolutely necessary with clubs other than those at which the above observations are directed.    The definition in the Bill coupled with the nature of its operative provisions will, I hope,  achieve this object as nearly as is possible oEC RE T. .P. 172(85).
3.67The operative provisions of the Bill, while giving much stronger powers of dealing with objectionable Night Clubs, have therefore been drawn bo as not to apply automatically undue burdens on&apos;unobjectionable Night Clubs which may fall within the definition.    They are based on the temporary Act of 1915 but are somewhat more stringent,, and provide  (as regards &quot;Night Clubs&quot;  only however)   (1) for a careful review of the circumstances indicated in the Bill on application to be registered,   (2) for greater discretion in the Court as to whether or not to grant registration, and (3) for periodical reconsideration by the Court after a similar review. The other important point in the Bill is that it gives as regards &quot;Night Clubs&quot; more effective powers of entry and inspection.    Mention should perhaps be made of Clause 9 which applies to all clubs and imposes a penalty on anyone having control of a club who knowingly permits it to be used as an habitual resort of reputed prostitutes or of persons who have been convicted of certain offences.As I have indicated in the House of Commons that I hope to introduce the Bill before Easter, I shall be glad if the Cabinet can deal with the matter at an early date,W.  J. H.20th March,   1925.Ell-12.
