* o ^ 9  ej &amp;THIS DOCUiviENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * 3 GOVERNMENT.Secret CABINET.CP. 151(25).TRADE OUTLOOK.Aiemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.&quot; &apos;In continuation of CP. 74(25), I circulate, for the information of the Cabinet, a summary of the views expressed at the last meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council.Last month, the forecast given at this meeting was much less hopeful than that given two months before. This month the feeling of depression has grown and is more general.     Moreover, increasing stress is laid on the fact that in coal, iron and steel, and in some &quot;branches of engineering, the real position Is worse than the volume of business transacted would lead one to suppose.     Orders are constantly being taken at a loss in order to reduce the rate of overhead charges and to keep works going.      This is depleting reserves?   and the process cannot be continued indefinitely.     It is this fact which makes the delay in any general revival of trade more serious.     It will he seen from the statements on the Iron and Steel Trade how serious Is the effect of the railway rates consequent upon the present standard of railway wages.(Intld.)    P.C-L.-board of Trade,12th March,  1925.

ENGINEERING AND SHIPBUILDINGSIR GLYNN WEST said that the small tool trade had shown a slight improvement, probably due to the running out of stocks at home;   but this had been followed again by a decline.Other branches of the Engineering trade were not doing well; there was increased foreign competition for locomotives and boilers.     Indian orders for boilers,and   locomotives also, had recently gone to Germany,at prices which would here represent bare wages and material costs, including no allowance for overhead charges.     The position was becoming serious for the locomotive makers:    they had faced adverse conditions bravely for a long time, but their situation was now extremely bad.Shipbuilding also was experiencing extraordinarily keen foreign competition.     Those orders which had been placed here lately had been at very low prices, making practically no allowance for overhead charges.In connection with the case mentioned at the last meeting, where a German quotation for ships was  153,000 as against a British one of  225,000. the President said he had had enquiries made in Berlin and Hamburg as to whether the German prices contained any subsidy, and had come to the conclusion that they did not.     There was certainly no Government subsidy but the particular yard in question in that case was connected with the A.E.G., and could probably do the work cheaper than other German yards.     There was probably now no Government moneyTHE TRADE OUTLOOK.ENGINEERING - GENERAL TRADE.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR said, with regard to the Sheffield steel and tool trades, that! home business was good, hut export business had shown a considerable falling off during the last two or three weeks.    The Canadian and Japanese trade was almost dead.   They were moving into a difficult period for the smaller firms, some of which had been very much tried   financially for a long time: two or three failures had now taken place,  and this fact would have repercussions on other small firms.   More financial difficulties in Sheffield were to be feared if trade did not improve.As regards German Import Licences, Sheffield had experienced no difficulty;    there was now more trade being done with Germany than at any time since the tV&apos;ar, and no difficulty was being met with in pbtaining payment.The situation generally however was not satisfactory.    There was, 30 to speak, no weight behind the trade.    Turnovers were not as good as in January of last year, largely on account of the loss of Canadian and Japanese trade.The home trade however, as already mentioned, was good.

ENGINEERING AND SHIPBUILDING.available in Germany for shipbuilding or other subsidies, except loans for repayment during and after construction, which were not really in the nature of a subsidy, and moreover had not been taken advantage of in this particular case.Resuming, Sir Glynn West said that Dutch quotations also were about 20)? less than ours, though their wages were not very much lower   as in the case of Germany; but in Holland, in spite of denials, probably some sort of subsidy was granted,especially in the form of relief from local rates.   The President said he was having inquiry made into this point also. He understood that the capacity of the German yards was now about 1,100,000 tons per year and this was believed to be occupied at present to the extent of about one-third.Sir Glynn West stated that the heavy iron and steel trade in this country had shown no improvement.   The published trade figures were somewhat misleading, since the industryin order to compete at all, must keep its output up.    If it fell below a certain level, it would have to close down altogether.   He was afraid that, unless some new development took place,  a good many firms would have to  close down*   There had been much borrowing from banks, and losses were being incurred.   He looked forward with apprehension to the development of the situation this year.There was little demand from abroad now.    India was sending her orders to Germany,though there was some prospect that the Argentine railways would come forward with orders for rolling stock and rails.The motor-car industry was keeping up fairly well, but was not quite so good as formerly.    It was a good sign, however, that the builders of the smaller oars were now competing with Fords.    In reply to a renterk by the President that the unemploy-ment figures did not seem to show an increase, Sir Glynn West replied that this wa3 due to the fact that,in mass production processes, employers could not venture to dismiss surplus &quot;hands&quot; whenever a depression took place.The ?*iaehine Tool Trade was decidedly better, though perhaps this was to be attributed to the deferring of orders for the last few years.     Sir Arthur Balfour&apos;s remarks as to the financial difficulties of the small tool trade in Sheffield also applied, he believed, to the machine tool trade.     The wire and rod trade was slightly improved both for home and export, especially the latter.     Prices, though they could not be called good, were somewhat better.Continental makers&apos; prices for semi-manufactured material, such as billets and rods, were now a little higher,   and their competition was not as keen as formerly.     There were reports that our competitors in Germany were also losing money, though it seemed difficult to understand how this could be so.Billets and sheet bars Imported into this country last year amounted to 1^ million tons:    this was higher than the year before, and indeed constituted a record.     In 1913 the corresponding importation was only about 1 million tons.- 2 -
O Q ip  o oENGINEERING AND SHIPBUILDING.Our total normal output of Iron and Steel goods was about 8 million tons a year;  against this had to be set the present importation of 1-h million tons of billets and bars, which should, under normal conditions, have been made in this country.The British industry was suffering especially from high railway rates; about 25)1 of the total selling prices now realised were having to be paid over to the railways.    Railway rates per ton were about 50?o above 1914 figures, and their cost amounted to something like  2 per ton of iron and steel, as against only about  1 before the war.    On the other hand, owing to the bad state of trade, the selling cost of iron and steel was only some 35/2 higher now than before the war.SHIPBUILDING - IRON AND STEEL.COLONEL LITHGOW said that not only in shipbuilding, but in the iron and steel trades generally, the fact must, he thought, be accepted that German costs were about two-thirds of our own. It had been said that the Germans were losing money, but ho could hardly believo that was the case.    Dantzig also had recently become a competitor in shipbuilding.Prospects appeared to be gloomy on a long view.   He feared that in future, instead of leading the world in shipbuilding, we should be likely to be confined to a section of our own home trade. Everything seemed to point to German costs being only some two-thirds of our own, and this was not due to their lower overhead charges.Mr. Samuel asked whether it was not rather&apos; to be attributed to the lower level of wages for skilled men (61 gold pfennigs per hour) and the longer working week - 52-? to 54 hours.Colonel Lithgow agreed, but remarked that thero appeared to be an impression ourrent in this country, both among employers and workpeople,  that the lower level of German costs was due to transient conditions, such as depreciated currencies,  subsidies, and the like; he wished, however, to emphasize the view that conditions in Germany were now stabilised, and the lower level of their costs was on a permanent basis.Sir G. ?,rest observed that their wages had not kept up to increased cost of living by some 25 to 30^.Proceeding, Colonel Lithgow said that the shipbuilding trade was experiencing a difficulty in some cases owing to inability   to pay its artisans of certain olasses wages as high as those paid in similar employment outside; thus ship-joiners, for example, were earning lower wagos than house joiners, with the result that difficulty was being mot with in getting joiners for shipbuilding work.    Skilled shipbuilders got less than skilled men- in other similar occupations; he thought that for skilled men, 55/- per week of 48 hours was about our average,  as compared with the German wages of .61 gold pfennigs per hour for a 52-h to 54 hour week.Sir G-lyn West thought, however, that actual drawings on piece work were nearer  3 a woek than  5/- per week;  in Germany the corresponding drawings would probably be about 35/- per week.Colonel Lithgow observed that at this time last year our Shipbuilders were paying 7/- a week less than now;  the men realised that the industry could not afford to pay more and
a q f] fa s3 5SHIPBUILDING - IRON AND STEEL.admitted as much., but pointed out to the Industrial Court the increased cost of living and increased wages In other industries,Mr. Gallacher observed that if wages here were reduced to the German level the result would probably be  that employees&apos; conditions of life would be such that it would not be possible to get efficient labour from them.      Engineers  to-day in Glasgow were getting some  2.14. 6 a week, as against  2.11.0 before the war.Sir Glynn West said that the figure of  2.11.0 before the war might perhaps have represented drawings on piece work, but would not represent the standard wage, which was about 36/- to 38/-, at any rate in England.Lliners, Mr. Gallacher, observed, were now earning some  2,10.0 a week as against 35/- pre-war.Sir Glynn West said that a most marked difference, comparing present with pre-war conditions,   was  that between the increase obtained by the unskilled man as against the skilled. The wages of unskilled labour had been practically doubled, while in the case- of the skilled man the increase was nothing like as much.Colonel Lithgow remarked that the iron and steel Industry had done their part in reducing costs to a much greater extent than the industries which might be  termed their &quot;sub-contractors&quot;.IRON AND STEEL.Mr. DORkAM said that the position in the iron and steel industry was very unfavourable.      The production of pig iron in January of this year was 569,000 tons,   as against last year&apos;s monthly average of -609,000 tons, and of steel 605,000 tons as against 685,000.&apos; tons.On the other hand imports of iron and steel and manufactures  thereof had   risen - they amounted to 235,000 tons for January,  as against a monthly average of 202,000 tons in 1924.Exports were, however, slightly better, at 325,000 tons, as against a monthly average of 321,000 tons  in 1924.      Exports had been been the industry&apos;s great disappointment during the last eighteen months and this slight improvement was welcome, even if it were only a temporary development.Continental competition was still very keen.      It was found that, every time their exchanges weakened, a new flood of low quotations came in from the Continent,  especially France and Belgium, for semi-manufactured material, and also more finished products such as steel joists.      The latter were being quoted at from  5.9.0 to  5,11.6d. per ton, which, adding 6/- for delivery in British ports, gave a figure of about  5.16.0 per ton - the cheapest price yet known.Chief among the difficulties with which the British industry was contending were the increases In railway rates,  of over 50 per cent.j in dock charges of 85 per cent.j rates and taxes, 200 per cent;    and coal, from 60 to 80 per cent., over pre-war; while  the selling prices of their own products had only gone up
c 9 o 6 0 0CONFIDENTIAL. IRON AND STEEL.some 35 per cent.In several cases blast furnaces had been put out, with the incidental result that coke prices had beoome very easy.   There had been a slight falling off in black and galvanised sheets, and his experience was that there had been a slight decline in wire alBO.     Constructional steel was the best situated branch as regards quantity, but the prioes were very muoh cut.Generally speaking, British steel works were never in better order than now to produoe cheaply, but they required assured markets.     He considered that in semi-manufactured steel alone British makers could reduoe their cost of production by about 15/- per ton if they could keep their works going at full oapacity.     Perhaps our blast furnaces, on the whole, were not quite up to the German standard, but many of the rolling mills were so.A point had   now, he thought, been reaohed In the history of our iron and steel trade where, unless a speedy revival took plaoe, a good many firms who had been living on their resources for the past year or two, would be compelled to go out of business, and production would have to be on a less soale for the future.Wages in the industry were comparatively on the low side. The real difficulty lay in the faot that the employees in the sheltered trades had succeeded in establishing themselves in a disproportionately favourable position. (MR. BAKER reported that although he had not had an opportunity of going into the matter closely, all the indications seemed to him to show that the position had worsened during the past month.He would mention that, according to press reports, one large firm are erecting new tinplate mills and, in the opinion of experienced workmen, the opening of these mills will cause others to be closed down.     This could not, In his opinion, be accepted as an indication of improved trade.There were some rumours current in the House of Commons that ship-plates have been sold abroad for as muoh as 30/-a ton les3 than they are sold in the home market.     This might, however, be a special internal arrangement between associated firms.Indications also pointed to the likelihood that the Bank Rate would be raised on the following Thursday, (5th Maroh). This, it was to be feared, would have a disastrous effect on the financial position of some of the weaker firms in the iron and steel industry.COAL. iSIR ADAM NIMIIO said the situation in the coal industry was a good deal worse than a month previously.     Production was on the down grade, and was now some 500,000 tons per week less than a year ago.     The ooal trade was probably one of the blackest  J spot3 in the Industrial situation of the whole country.
CONFIDENTIAL. COAL.Collieries were running very short time in many districts, espeoially those working for export.     The plight of the inland collieries, however, was also bad, as a result of the situation in the heavy trades generally, whioh seemed to have beoome worse of late.     Very few blast furnaces were now working In his firm&apos;s area in Scotland,The finanoial strain on the ooal industry was becoming severe.     The companies had been endeavouring to carry on in spite of serious losses, but oould not oontinue to do so indefinitely.     There was bound to be a substantial lessening of output on acoount of the slackening of demand.     This decline of output would probably be first apparent in lancashire, South Wales and Sootlandj   in the Notts and Derby districts it would be likely to manifest itself later on.     In spite of the expense of keeping oollieries idle, a point was reached at which it became oheaper to do this than to continue to work them at a loss.The only remedy for the present state of affairs, he considered, lay in bringing the industry into line with Its competitors elsewherej    in the long run, he thought, the British industry would have to come down to French and Belgian wages and hours.Conditions in the German mining oommunities did not seem to be resulting in any hardship to the workman there. They appeared to be fairly well satisfied at present, and to be enjoying a reasonable standard of comfort.     German workmen, however, seemed more disposed to accommodate themselves for the time being to prevailing conditions.ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.MR. HIRST (by letter).    &quot;There is little change in the Electrical Industry, as compared with the state of affairs for the previous month.     The order books are still satisfactory though orders during the last month have not come In quite so freelyj    there seems to be slight hesitanoy in oertain parts of the country, particularly those dependent on wool, ship-building, and the coal and steel industries,&quot;There is no change in the export business.     India, China and the Argentine are still considerably below normal:    the improvement notioeable in Australia and South Africa referred to at previous Meetings still continues,&quot;Foreign competition, though not exactly serious, has shown more activity during the last month but, on the whole,      () the situation in the Sleotrical Industry is not unsatisfactory.
CONFIDENTIAL . SHIPPING.SIR ALAN ANDERSON said that the general feeling in the. shipping industry was gloomy.Referring to the Preston Report, it was curious, he remarked, that both in Canada and Australia the feeling existed that conferences of shipping lines were dangerous.    It was in fact not possible to have lines without a conference, since they must be to some extent protected, from the fluctuations of the general freight market.   The tramp vessel competed solely on price, but the liner on regularity and quality of service. Conferences did not have the effect of abolishing competition, and indeed these expensive vessels could not be run without a conference.    Though it did not matter to a shipowner if he were formally In a conference or not, without some understanding between themselves, the various lines would kill each other by cut-throat competition, and only tramp services would bo left.With regard to the Australian Commonwealth fleet, attempts were being made to sell this on two conditions (1) that the buyers would not increase rates.  (2) that they would not enter a conference.   The first of these conditions involved a mere gamble, and no such undertaking could be given: the second was equally impossible of acceptance.    If the Australian Government insisted on these conditions they would, he suggested, do better to keep their fleet.The general feeling among ship-owners about trade was very gloomy, and shipbuilding was suffering from offers from abroad at lower prices.Sir Alan referred to the recent trials of the :,Rotorw ship; on the occasion in question the vessel was difficult to operate, and only made a slow speed.TEXTILES - COTTON.COLONEL SSDDON BROvvN said that the Cotton trade had deteriorated.The Egyptian side of the trade was still working full time, but was making less profit, on account of the high price of Egyptian cotton and the fluctuations of the sxipply.The American section was now working 35 hours per week only; its prospects were not good.   Cheaper cotton and a reduction in costs of production were necessary in both the Egyptian and American sections,  if improved trade were to be secured.The Empire Cotton-Growing and British Cotton-Growing Associations were doing good work; more Empire cotton had been used this season than ever before, and the prejudice against new sources of supply had to some extent, he thought, been broken down.As regards import licences in Germany, the cotton trade was suffering severely from the inability of their   German customers to obtain licences.    German Cotton manufacturers had been doing so well recently that they were now trying to produce the finer grade goods such as are made in Lancashire;    also, they
TEXTILES -   WOOL.MR. ANDREWS said that conditions in the wool trade were gloomier&quot;this month than last.There had been a fall of 25 per cent.in wool prices from New Zealand and Australia: this was not entirely attributable to bad trade here, but was generally the case with all wool-using countries.    There appeared to be a kind of strike against the high prices ruling In September and October last.TEXTILES    -   COTTON.were apparently endeavouring to damage our trade by putting about reports that it was dangerous for German buyers to come to England to buy goods.The trouble In obtaining licences was, according to the cotton traded experience, worse now than for six months past,-perhaps on account of the larger demand for our fine goods at the moment.   The method of obtaining licences seemed to afford a good deal of scope for questionable practices; some of the more knowing German merchants contrived to obtain licences in (advance and keep them until they were wanted.MR , JUDSON said that, in spite of the biggsr United States cotton crop, and the shorter hours now being worked in the American section of the trade, the price of the raw material was still going up.The reduction of hours from 39% to 35 a week had been a bitter disappointment to the workpeople.It was noticeable that some excuse was nearly always found in the States for discounting in advance the prospects of the cotton crop, and so putting up prices.The British industry was not afraid of the increase of spindles and looms in foreign markets;    thus, for example, although the United States now made up more cotton goods for themselves, yet we were exportingmoreto them.In India the unsettlement of conditions was such that, whereas before the war some 40$ of our exports of ootton goods had gone there, the present amount was not half as much.In China also trade was affected by the prevailing disturbancea.We had,- however, done more business with Germany, the Near East and South America than before the War. This had helped ,, . to tide over the situation.In conclusion, Mr. Judson wished to emphasize that what &apos; was wanted above all was cheaper cotton.
o a toTEXTILES: WOOL.The industry was passing through a period of depression, and some failures were likely; but an improvement might take place if prices could be brought down to a reasonable level.Under-r-employment was the worst feature of the labour situation: the Industry was probably employing larger numbers than economically It should do.TEXTILES: WORSTED,  ETC.MR. SUTCLIFFE SMITH said that a general wave of depression was passing over the textile trade.&apos;   Botany spinning was unfavourably situated, though cross-breds were a little better. Mohair was bad, and 60 per cent, of spindles only were running.With regard to the question of import licences for Germany, he thought that, before these could become freely obtainable, Germany would first have to work off the flood eif stocks which had come in from Alsace before the expiry of the special Treaty provisions.Generally,- only about 50 per cent, of looms were running. The home trade was stagnant, while for export the place of worsted was largely being taken by the cheaper woollen goods. Italian competition was strong In the Near Eastern countries, and also French competition both in our Home and export trade. Business with Australia, however, was pretty good, and in China also the outlook was more hopeful, though severe competition from Japan was being encountered there.    In India, where the course of business usually showed a tendency to follow that in China, some Improvement in demand seemed likely,A large amount of artificial silk was now being used in piece goods, and might to some extent permanently replace cotton in the future,   British manufacturers could turn out as good artificial silk yarns as any country, in spite of some statements to the contrary in the Press.GENERAL TRAPS - FOOD INDUSTRIES.MR. STANLEY MACHIN (by letter):- &quot;So far as the Food interest is concerned there is nothing new.   Export trade still shows signs of increasing activity, but so far as the general home trade is concerned,  I regret that the optimism which existed.during the first few weeks of the year does not now continue. Things are drifting back to a dull state and complaints are pretty general,I yesterday had to attend a Chamber of Commerce function at Newcastle-on-Tyne when I met most of the leading commercial men of the district.     You are no doubt aware of the conditions in. this Port, but I think I should let you know that nothing can exaggerate the seriousness of the commercial outlook.     Without exception the leading
POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS   said he had not much to add to his report in the previous month on the Pottery Industry.    The total of exports was still maintained, but their distribution was different: Canada had taken less and Australia more.    The export of high-grade products was fairly maintained, but larger quantities of the cheaper grades had been exported, notably to France.    There had been a very definite increase in the export of low-grade material to France - a trade which had fallen off considerably two years ago.Employment had shown a big improvement.    The beginning of the year was generally a bad season for the pottery trade, but they were now getting back to normal.    The English and Scottish stone-ware trade, however,  was still slack.As regards wages, a practice had long existed in the industry for six weeks&apos; notice to be given before the 25th March in each year of any intention on the part of either employers or employees to call for u change of wages;    none had been given this year, consequently wage rates would remain stable now until 19 26,Summing up, Mr. Hollins said that the export trad9 was well maintained; the home trade, though not as good as might have been hoped, was not bad.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON    said that conditions in Australia continued good: the pastoral, dairy and fruit industries were doing well. There had, it was true, been a drop in wool prices recently, but even so an adequate remuneration remained for the grower . Some 70,000 bales of wool (about half the total clip) still remained to be sold in Australia:    this was the outcome of the new policy not to sell the whole at once.GENERAL TRADE - FOOD INDUSTRIES.members of both the Coal and Shipping trade reported deplorable-able conditions, one concern stating that they were losing at the rate of nearly  10,000 a week.    Without being unduly pessimistic.  I may add that during a somewhat long business career,  I have never seen such a state of commercial depression as appears to exist in this important centre.    The existing conditions of labour seem to have made it Impossible for sellers of British coal to compete with foreigners and Germany appears to be in a position to control the Continental market. Indeed, one of the oldest and most representative traders stated that it was only a question of time for German coal  to  he&apos; imported into Newcastle-on-Tyne,    It is not easy to suggest a remedy, but It would appear impossible for existing conditions to continue for any length of time11.&apos;
2iiCONFIDENTIAL. AUSTRALIAN TRADE.There had been an interesting development in cotton-growing in Australia, namely the planting of an experimental area in the Northern Territories.In the meat trade   prospects were better.As regards Coal, New South Wales had produced 12 million tons in 1924, at a pit mouth value of  9,500,000; this set up a reoord to date.With regard to the financial situation, the total amount of deposits in the State and Commonwealth Savings banks at the end of the year amounted to  176,000,000: this was the largest figure so far reached.    Shipments of gold had already been arranged for to the value of seven or eight millions sterling, and Government permission had been given for re-export of this if required, free from the restrictions applying to gold already in the country.CHINESE TRADE.MR. LAND ALE said that, generally speaking, there was no improvement In the import of Manchester goods into China, prices being still too high.    In Engineering business also there was very little doing.In Exports from China there was a fair business, slightly better than last year.The Railways were still to a large extent in the hands of tb Military.    Traffic had been resumed on the Northern Railway to the extent of about 60$ of normal,  and on the Shanghai-Nanking Railway to about 40$.    The Shanghai-Ningpo Railway was a little better at 80$. The Chinese portion of the Rowloon to Canton Railway was still practically closed.    The country was still in a very disturbed state, and further fighting on the Shanghai-Nanking Railway was expected.Trade in and around the waters of the Colony of Hongkong was being seriously menaced by the piracy of steamers, whether flying the British flag or flag of other nationality. TheChinese had hitherto shown themselves powerless to suppress it. Measures had been imposed by the Hongkong Government, but experience had shown them to be ineffectual and in some degree harmful.    Their character had been the erection on the steamers of grilles, the enlisting of Indian guards for service on the steamers and the arming of the Officers on the Bridge,A Report had been drawn up by Representatives of the Hongkong Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Combined European Officers and Engineers Guilds, passing severe criticism on the system prevailing, which had been given&quot; a fair trial but &quot;which from experience they are convinced is wrong&quot;.    Constructively it was urged that piratical attacks would cease if an adequate fleet of patrol craft could be provided, and police supervision, both ashore and in /the Harbour-, of Hongkong,materially reinforced.

K (* &apos;l dconfidential .CHINESE TRADE.This matter seemed to require cooperation between such Departments, as the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office and the Admiralty) and their respective Representatives on the spot.indian trade, &apos; 1.......&apos; - .&apos;&apos;mr. lindsay 3aid that India&apos;s&quot;export trade was well maintained. Prices had risen during last year,, and rupee, values had gone up; the margin between exports and imports of merchandise had&apos;also : increased.At the same time imports of gold and silver into India bad increased.    Some misunderstanding appeared to exist as regards:the imports of gold;    these were not really disproportionately higher than before the war, when compared with the increase in imports of merchandise.The two points of chief interest this month were (1) the Indian exchange, and (2) the tea question.As to the former, the Indian exchange had been very s teady during the last six months, on account of the Indian Government^ action in selling currency bills regularly at a price of l/6d; the commercial community knew that the Government would not sell if rates were below l/6d, though on the other hand If they rose above l/6d the Government would sell more and more at each rise, and this had tended to keep rates steady.The Finance Member had obtained a surplus by over-buying in the present year, having bought sterling to the value of  35,000,000 during the past ten months, as against  28,000,000 during the whole of the previous year.   He had used this surplus to increase the India Government&apos;s holding of British securities, with the object of keeping the exchange down,  thus counteracting the effect of the surplus of exports over imports, which, if left to itself, would have.sent the rate up.As \regar.d.s...Tea; there had been criticism of the gardens for &apos; hot increasing their output to meet the demand; 1 but, having.lost heavily in 1920 on account of t^e slump In tea prices and the fall in the exchange, the growers now hesitated to increase their labour supply.   Labour supply was the root of the whole question, since labour wab necessary&quot;for the weeding and draining df;the gardens. &apos;-&apos; Extensions bf&apos; the : g ar d e ns&apos; woul d ;&apos;t ake three &quot;to five years to make their--effect &apos;felt -in increased &quot;output.&apos; Moreover, new : labour was difficult to:obtainj  &apos;and this -difficulty as well-as the fear of the possible risk involved, deterred the growers from taking steps to increase their output.    Some gardens had sold forward for two &quot;or three years;   but this had led to 6r$ii-&amp;i&apos;ii^ had&apos;forbidden forward sales.    This step,  In turn, had not gone . uncriticised, &apos; -   ;;   -c;y- ^-v x&quot;     -     - .:.r:.-       t;&apos;o&apos;a p-&apos;:Both the United States and the United Kingdom were now taking more tea, while &apos; there was no immediate prospect of a substantial increase in the supply.      -;v ; &apos;&apos;;: r!&apos; r;;: -newZealand trade. &apos; :;&apos; ;! sir JAMES allen , said that&apos; New; Zeal and *a total trade last year (imports and exports) had been;to the value of  101,000,000,-the largest volume recorded, except during the import boom of
With regard to the organisations created in New Zealand to control trade, Sir James observed that the Meat Board had proved able to carry on its operations without interfering with the ordinary channels of distribution.The Butter Board, which was to be armed with large powers, was not yet functioning, and he did not think that the control provided by it would operate till October 1925;    the Dairy industry in New Zealand wished to have discussions with those concerned with the distribution of dairy produce    in this country.Boards had . also been constituted by the last New Zealand Parliament to deal with Fruit and Honey, but their powers only extended to inspection and similar matters in New Zealand: they had no power to establish their own agencies in this country.Prospects in New Zealand were generally good.    It was true that the price of wool had gone down, but the present price still left a good margin. -Emigration was improving; the nomination system was working better than he had anticipated, and this year probably the figures would reach the full quota of 10,000.    It was being found that those who went out to New Zealand were nominating their friends.FINANCE.MRf BRAND said that the financial situation in Germany remained about the same as when he last reported, except that the Bank rate there was now down to 9%, but private discount rates were not down.     It sswaed that the Bank Rate had been lowered somewhat prematurely.    The demand for capital in Germany continued to be as large as before;    in particular, there was still a great demand on Lonion for credits, but probably the Germans were now finding it harder to get accommodation here. The difficulty in the case of Germany, and&quot;indeed the whole of the Continent, was that&apos; they required working capital but could only get short credit.    A few five-year loans had been granted to Germany in London and some of rather longer terms in New York, but most were short-dated.    Such long-term loans as &quot;had been made in New York were only to a few first-class firms, and had not been   notably successful;    so that he thought It was not likely that more would be floated.The French financial position was not at all good.   All sorts of remedial projects were before the French Government, but none seemed satisfactory.The Bank Rate here, had, he thought, only been kept down during the past year by the restrictions which had been placed on lending abroad.    The very high interest rates ruling abroad were bound to have their effect on the rates in this country so long as we continued to lend abroad.NSW ZEALAND TRADE.1920. The export balance was better than last year, exports being to the value of some  52,500., 000, and imports some  48,500,000.
CONFIDANTIAL. Finance.721. PEASE observed as regards United States credits to Germany, that statements were current that &quot;facilities for lending to Germany were now being withdrawn&quot;; he was not sure of the meaning of this, but presumed that it referred to credits granted by banks and others in America to Germany.MR. BRAND replied that  although he personally had not heard this report, it was a fact that many United States houses would not make German issues.    The Krupp loan had not gone well, and there was reason to think that the A.E.G&apos;s recent public issue in New York had not proved as successful as had been made to appear.A long-term loan of large amount had been made in New York to Poland during the last week or two, the rate being about 8% or 9%, on the security of the Polish Government&apos; guarantee only.The United States also had been lending to France:    the Chemin de Fer de l&apos;Est had recently borrowed a large sum.Banking.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE said that, as regards monetary conditions, the chief matter of interest was the situation of money rates.    Our rates here were lower than those ruling on the Continent and the United States, and with the rise of the American rate last week there had been a general anticipation that some similar steps would have to be taken here:    this had been strengthened by the Bank of England announcement that they would charge 5-k% for weekly loans instead of A^fo.   Hence expectations had arisen that the Bank of England Rate would go up this week.There had been a corresponding effect on the exchanges; the Dollar exchange had depreciated, though it had since recovered slightly.Much nervousness was felt as regards the French position, as much among the French themselves as others: the weakness of the French exchange was specially noticeable in Paris.The hardening of rates here had lowered gilt- edged investments.    The fact that Australia had been obtaining gold from the United States had affected the United States exchange, since this gold had been paid for by the purchase of dollars from this side,   Australia had also obtained some gold direct from South Africa: this might have an indirect effect on the United States exchange, but not a direct one.In reply to a question by phe President, Mr. Pease said that not much change had been shown during the last month in the industrial demand for money.  .Rajlways .SIR HERBERT WALKER    said that it was difficult to draw any useful conclusions from a comparison of the current railway statistics with those for the corresponding period last year, because of the strike at that time: but such conclusions as could be drawn were of a discouraging kind. The three Railway Groups which dealt specially with the heavy
CONFIDENTIAL. Rajlways .industries were feeling the effect of the depression in a marked degree.   General railway opinion was that trade conditions were on the down grade at present, and were likely to continue so in the immediate future.   Coal and iron and steel for export, were especially had.    General tonnage however was steady and, if anything, slightly up.MR. HIRCOMB&apos; (Ministry of Transport) said he had little to add to Sir Herbert Walker1s remarks on railways.   With regard to the point raised by Sir Glynn West and Mr. Dorman as to railway   -rates on iron and steel goods, the increase in that case amounted to about SQ%, as on all other goods in the corresponding Class of the railway goods tariff.   The incidence of this increase on the selling price must In turn depend on the relation of the present selling price to that ruling before the War.COLOMEL LITHGOW observed that the increase in the selling price over the pre-war level was about 55%.   There were however, additional railway charges to be taken into consideration, such as siding rents and demurrage.Co-operative Societies (Scotland).MR. GALLAGHER said that the Scottish Societies&apos; half-yearly report had now been received.    This showed some falling off in sales as compared with the previous half year *? mainly In the Glasgow district.   Generally speaking, trade in the east of Scotland was better than the west.   To some extent the deoline was due to the fall in values, - especially that of sugar, where there had been an actual decline in price, apart from the removal of the duty.   For the whole year, there was, however, a small increase in sales, amounting to 0,3 per cent, over 1923.   The Society had been able to distribute a dividend to their members at the rate of 4d. per   on sales.   Business so far this year had shown a slight decrease.   The price of tea had now risen again, and the commodity was dearer than in last April, in spite of the removal of the duty; but sales were, nevertheless, high.At the Society&apos;s Annual Show demand had not been, as good as a year ago.   This was largely to be traced to the slackness in the shipbuilding and coal-mining Industries.   The East Scottish mines were now only working some three days a week and a good many were closed:    the coal trade in that area was largely for export, and it had been rather hard hit by the situation on the Continent, resulting from Reparation coal deliveries and other factors.Generally, prospects appeared to have taken a somewhat adverse turn.Unemployment Figures:   (Ministry of Labour).MR. PHILLIPS said that since the last meeting of the Council, the unemployment figures had been very disappointing. At this time of the year a substantial fall normally took plaoe.   This yearhowever, the fall between the end of January and the end of February was under 5,000.    Last year
CONFIDENTIAL. Unemployment Figures:  (Ministry of Labour).there was a fall of 166,000 in the corresponding period, but a large part of this was due to the inflation of the figures at the end of January, 192 4, by something approaching 100,000, owing to a railway dispute, and the real fall was probably 80,000 or so.   The figures at the end of February 1925 were about 82,000 higher than at the end of February, 1924, and after allowance had been made for the additional numbers    &apos; brought on the registers   by the Unemployment Insurance Act of last year, these figures meant that unemployment was rather worse now than a year ago.

O   9sj ^REGARDING- THE EZPORT gHABg POSITION MAMS A3? THE MEETING OF THE ADVISORY CamiTOEDB TO THE DEPAROMEIta?       OVERSEAS 3?RAbE OH THE 18th FEBRUARY, 1925.IBOH AMD STEEL.Sir Arthur Balfour reported regarding the Sheffield trade that the promise of much improved trade, which was apparent at the end of last year, had hardly been maintained.Certainly a better volume of trade is being done, but it is still being done with too fine a margin of profit.-The disappointing features are our Canadian and Japanese trades, both of which have practically collapsed.$here are also serious signs of weakening in the engineering trades in Australia, and in consequence, Sheffield is likely to be affected.On the other hand our Central European trade is improving, but the French trade is practically dead, and it is going to be very difficult for Sheffield firms to continue their organisations in France at all, in view of the combination of tariffs and exchange.Mr. Hichens recorded no improvement in the iron, steel&quot;and shipbuilding trades.     He regretted that certain threatened increases of wages made the outlook less satis-factory and his opinion was that any stability which might be attained in rates of wages would probably bring an instant improvement in the general state of the trade. At the end of 1924 there were definite signs that we were overtaking our rivals in competition in the world&apos;s markets for various reasons which combined to make our competition effective.     He predicted that if wages in the iron and steel trade are raised to any extent in the near future our export trade would suffer heavily.Sir Charles Barrie could not draw a bright picture in regard to shipping.     The tonnage afloat was still far too much for the trade offering at present.     The bright spot of the chartering world was Australia, where a crop amounting to 2,000,000 tons required to be moved, but it was regrettable that vessels should have to proceed thither In ballast.      he Elver Plate trade appeared disappointing:, owing to a short crop.     The general outward cargo trade, which reflects the state of the manufacturing trade in the United Kingdom, could be characterised as fairly satisfactory. Other trades were in bad order, notably China and the Baltic, which was exceptionally bad.     With regard to the ship repairing trade, the tendency to send vessels to PLOtterdam for this&apos;purpose, which was being sedulously encouraged bythe/
0 w 9 &amp; t)-B-Confidential.the Dutch Government, was continuing in the same measure as before.     She British shipowner was faced with conditions which roughly amounted to the work being done there in one-third less time and at a quarter less cost, and until the wages question was adjusted to meet this, he was of opinion that the outlook could not improve.Mr. g.W. lee could bring forward little fresh to note in the cotton trade.     SEae hours in the American cotton section Had been reduced from 39^ to 35 per week. il!he fine cotton trade remained, however, on full time, but was somewhat hampered by speculation in raw material.Mr. Kenneth liee desired to report difficulties in the cotton printing trade arising out of the sales of reparation Indigo.     SDhis synthetic indigo is being sold in very large bulk in the United Kingdom at l/4^d. per lb; in JSrance it is being sold at 8d. per lb, and in Italy at 3d. to 3 d. per lb, also in the China and other markets at the same price.Mr., Boothman referred to the short time being worked in the American&apos; section of the cotton trade.   He stated that in spite of this reduction the future appeared to contain hopeful features *Colonel Willey had a bad report to make.     Machinery was not running by any means full time in any branch of the trade, the average being about 50 per cent capacity, and orders were not coming forward in good quantity.     It was abundantly proved that owing- to high prices the present world demand was insufficient to occupy to anything like the full the existing wool textile machinery, and owing to the likelihood of a continued lack of demand prospects were not encouraging.     In regard to those sections of the trade where competition was having a depressing effect on the industry in Great Britain, the most notable was the continental compe-tition experienced from Prance and Italy in dress goods, which was felt principally in the Near Eastern markets.In response to an enquiry, Colonel Willey gave it as his opinion, that as stocks of half worked material in Germany were now extremely low, orders for yarns and tops were soon likely to follow.ZQEEEBY.Major Wedgwood was able to congratulate the pottery trade on having achieved an annual settlement of the wages question to the great advantage of the trade, which could now proceed for twelve months on the basis of that settlement, which amounted to labour accepting the same remuneration as during the previous twelve months.     The general condition of the Industry remained unchanged, tiles and sanitaryware firms all being busy, and other potters on the slack side.-$ he/
She best markets at present were the Dominions and Colonies and the United States of America.     He referred also to the North Staffordshire Colliery trade which was in an exception-ally bad way.jgAHBB. STATIONERY AND ALLIES TRADES.Mr. Walker, speaking for the paper, stationery and allied trades, was ablo to record an improved trade with the Dominions and Colonies and South America.     3?he continental markets on the other hand appeared at least temporarily to be completely lost owing to various causes, among them being the question of the rates of exchange.CHINA TRADE.Mr v Dodwell stated that trade with China on the whole&quot; was better than when he last reported.     Deliveries had in the interval been good.     The railway situation however, was still chaotic and until it was brought into order a general improvement in trade could not be looked for.     He referred to severe competition, especially in machinery, in the China market.     He cited a case in which he had tendered a figure of  20,000 and found that the business was secured by a German firm at  5,000 less,   $lie terms of payment were one-third on signature of the contract; one-third on delivery, and one-third a year later, and he understood that the Germans complied with these conditions.EXPORT CREDITS.Colonel Peel reported that the Export Credits Department had been subjected to a considerable amount of work with only a small result.     It was his considered opinion that lack of credit was not a ruling factor in hampering export trade.     He was of opinion that the Export Credits Department acted undoubtedly as a stimulus to bankers in offering credit, and further that its effect on traders had also been good in causing them to look more carefully into the nature of the risks on which they were embarking.Confldentlal.
