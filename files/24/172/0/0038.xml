Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1925.(Ministry of Labour Industrial Memoranda Serial No. 1)35CABINET.WAGES AND  CONDITIONS  OF  RAILWAYMENTraffic Grades. The 1920 Settlement.THE rates of pay and conditions of service of the traffic grades (usually referred to as the &apos;&apos; conciliation &apos;&apos; grades) on the railways are governed by a series of agreements dating from March 1919 to March 1920, subsequently modified by decisions of the Central and National Wages Boards. The agreements of 1919 were concluded between the Railway Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the Government, and the National Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and those of 1920 between the Negotiating Committee of the General Managers, acting on behalf of the Minister of Transport, and the same two Unions.2. Under the agreements rates of wages were fixed to apply so long as the Cost of Living number remained at 125 per cent, above the pre-war figure, the rates to be subject to fluctuations in accordance with variations of the index figure. In addition, standard rates were also determined, the agreements providing that whatever might be the fall in the Cost of Living figure, no- man&apos;s rate could fall below the standard rate for his grade. These standard rates were fixed at a level approximately 100 per cent, over the pre-war rates.3. The last alteration under the sliding scale took place on the 1st January, 1925, when, owing to the increase in the Cost of Living index number, a proportion of the men in the traffic grades received an advance of 2s. per week.4. In addition to rates of wages, the agreements referred to above make provision for all other conditions of employment, such as overtime, Sunday duty, night duty, holidays, &amp;c. They also provide for a standard working week of forty-eight hours, a guaranteed week, exclusive of Sundays, and a guaranteed day.5. A table is attached (Appendix I) showing for the main traffic grades the rates at the highest level in January 1921, the present rates and consequent reductions since January 1921, the standard rates and amount of the excess of the present rates over the standard rates.Nature of Machinery for Negotiation.6. Negotiations on all questions relating to rates of pay, hours of duty and other conditions of service in the traffic grades, are conducted between the railway companies and the three Unions concerned, viz., the National Union of Railwaymen, tho Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association. In default of agreement such questions must be referred to the Central Wages Board or, on appeal, to the National Wages Board, in accordance with the provisions of Part IV of the Railways Act, 1921. Part IV was inserted at the request of, and with the agreement of, the Companies and the Unions, and the value of the machinery lies in its voluntary nature.7. The Central Wages Board is composed of .8 representatives of the railway companies and 8 representatives of the railway trade unions, 4 from the National Union of Railwaymen, 2 from the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and 2 from the Railway Clerks&apos; Association. The National Wages Board is composed of 6 representatives of the railway companies, 6 representatives of the railway trade unions (2 from each Union), 4 representatives [12796] bSECRET. CP. 138 (25).[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty-s Government.]
of the users of railways, and an independent Chairman (at present Sir William Mackenzie) nominated by the Minister of Labour.8. Following the enactment of the Railways Act, 1921, the Railway Companies and the Unions agreed upon a scheme for reconstituting the existing National and Central Wages Boards and for establishing Railway Joint Councils in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In this scheme it is provided that the National Wages Board shall come to a decision on any matters referred to it within twenty-eight days of the date of reference from the Central Wages Board, and it is agreed that no withdrawal of labour shall take place before the expiration of the twenty-eight days.Strike of Locomotive Drivers, January 1924.9. The reduction of hours of enginemen in 1919 from ten to eight per day led to the adoption of a common standard of 120 miles per day for mileage payments. In 1923, the Railway Companies put before the Unions claims for a revision of the National Agreements, including a claim for the abolition of mileage payments. No agreement was reached on this question, and it was referred, with the other claims, to the National Wages Board in December 1923. They decided that the system of payment on a mileage basis should continue, but that the basis should be 150 and not 120 miles per day. This finding was accepted by the N.U.R. and Railway Clerks&apos; Association. The A.S.L.E.F. referred it to a ballot of their members, the result of which showed a large majority against acceptance. The A.S.L.E.F, failed to persuade the Railway Managers to alter their decision to carry out the finding of the Board and, after an unsuccessful attempt at intervention by the General Council of the Trade Union Congress, the strike began at midnight on the 20th January. Further negotiations took place between a committee of the Trade Union Congress and the Managers, which resulted in a settlement on the 29th January. The companies agreed to deal with certain special grievances and, as to mileage payments, agreed that from the first pay week in January 1924, 130 miles should equal one day&apos;s pay, that from the first pay week in july 1924, 140 miles should equal one day&apos;s pay, and from the first pay week in January 1925, 150 miles should equal one day&apos;s pay, &quot;unless in the interval it was agreed otherwise at a meeting to be convened for the purpose.&quot;Thus a strike successfully upset a decision of the National Wages Board to which the Union of which the strikers were members had been parties.During the latter part of 1924, after the A.S.L.E.F. had failed to come to an agreement with the Railway Companies on the question of the mileage to be in force from January 1925, the question was referred to the National Wages Board, who decided that the 150 miles basis should not come into operation; mileage payments to enginemen accordingly continue to be made on the basis of 140 miles.Recent Demands of N. V.R. and Railway Clerks.10. On the 10th December, 1924, the National Union of Railwaymen and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association presented to the Railways Staff Conference, as covering the main trunk lines, and the London Electric and Metropolitan Companies, an &quot; all grades&quot; programme. The demands contained in this programme affect all grades in the railway service, including salaried staffs, traffic staffs and shopmen. So far as the salaried staffs are concerned, the proposed new scales of salaries for the male clerical staff are based on an increase of  10 a year in the minimum for practically all classes. For the traffic grades, the demands include proposals for a Tate of 16s. a day for all locomotive drivers, 12s. Qd. a day for firemen, rates varying from 60s. to 93s. per week for signalmen, rates for porters of 63s. per week in London and 60s. at all other stations, and rates for guards of 78s. for London and 75s. at other stations.11. In regard to hours, the demands include a proposal to abolish the provision for extended rosters for locomotive men, the 8-hour day to be rigidly applied. For certain signalmen a 36-hour week is proposed, for the signal and telegraph staff, 44 hours, for the dining-car staff, 48 hours, for the goods and cartage staff, 44 hours, and for permanent-way men, 44 hours.12. Other claims include a demand for time and a half for night duty between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., double time for Sunday duty from midnight Saturday to midnight Sunday, time and a half for overtime from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and double time from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., a minimum of twelve working days for annual holidays, and pensions at 60 years of age for all grades.
13. The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen refused to co-operate with the National Union of Railwaymen and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association in drawing up this programme, and accordingly are not parties to it.Counter-Claim by Companies.14. The Railways Staff Conference have considered the proposals put forward by the two Unions, and a conference was held on the 3rd February, 1925. At this meeting the Unions were informed that the claims put forward would involve an increase in the annual wages bill of the railways of 45 million pounds, which would more than absorb the net receipts of all the companies, that the pre-war annual wages bill was 47 million pounds, and the present wages bill 120 million pounds, which was an increase of 155 per cent., that if the present demands were granted it would bring the wages bill up to 250 per cent, above pre-war, that the railway receipts had decreased by over 3 million pounds in 1924 compared with the previous year, and that, in the circumstances, not only could the railway companies not concede the claims of the Unions, but it was also necessary to press for a reduction of the labour costs. The Companies therefore proposed that there should be a reduction in the wages of men in the traffic grades of 4s. per week in London and Qs. per week in the Provinces. It will be noted that a reduction has not been proposed in the case of the Clerks and Shopmen.15. This counter-claim of the Railway Companies has been considered by the Executive of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, who have decided to refer the &quot; all grades &quot; programme, so far as they are concerned, to the Central Wages Board. The Executive of the National Union of Railwaymen on the 7th February decided to refer their claim to the Central Wages Board, but on condition that the Board should consider the whole programme for all grades. As the Railway Shopmen (see below) and the Restaurant Car Staff are not within the scope of the Central or National Wages Boards, as defined in the Railways Act, 1921, Part IV, this stipulation raises difficulties. It may be actuated partly by the desire to gain time, for the National Union of Railwaymen were undoubtedly taken aback by the Companies&apos; summary treatment of their claim, partly in furtherance of their policy of winning over the Railway Shopmen to their Union. The majority of the Railway Shopmen are still represented by the Amalgamated Engineering Union and other craft unions, who have hitherto refused to condescend to joint negotiations with the National Union of Railwaymen. Even if these Unions would agree to let their case go to the Wages Boards, they would certainly demand representation upon them, for which there is no provision in the Act.16. The Railways Staff Conference sent their proposals for reductions in wages to the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and met them on the 16th February. The Society took the line that the difference between the Companies and the N.U.R. was no concern of their Society.17. A table is attached (Appendix II), giving a comparison of the present standard and current rates with the rates claimed by the Unions and by the Companies.18. It is not expected that a serious position is likely to arise at the present moment. As indicated above, conciliation machinery exists for dealing with claims and counter-claims. It is certain that no agreement is likely to be reached on these claims by the Central Wages Board, in which case they will be referred to the National Wages Board, when the cases of both sides will be publicly stated. Each side will naturally desire that the Board should be responsible for recommending either an increase in wages or the abatement or rejection of the &quot;all grades&quot; programme, as the case may be.Railway Shopmen.19. Many of the difficulties affecting railway shopmen in recent years have arisen as a result of the rivalry between the National Union of Railwaymen and the various craft Unions. The National Union of Railwaymen is an industrial organisa-tion catering for all grades in the railway service, and they have incurred the enmity of the craft Unions because they have endeavoured to organise in their Union some of the skilled men in the railway shops. At the present time a Committee of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress is endeavouring to settle the differences between the National Union of Railwaymen and the Craft Unions, and unless success[12796] B 2
attends these efforts the rivalry between the Unions is bound to lead to further difficulties in the future. ;20. The rates of wages and conditions of employment of railway shopmen on all the railways in Great Britain, except the Great Central Section of the London and North-Eastern Railway, are governed by Award 728 of the Industrial Court, dated the 8th July, 1922. This Award proceeded upon the principle of regarding the railway service as a distinct industry to which special conditions should attach, and prescribed rates of wages and conditions of service for railway shopmen as such. Hitherto, the rates of railway shopmen employed on the various railways had not been determined according to any uniform principle, and the result was that wide variations existed in the remuneration of similar classes-of men according to the line on which, or the place at which, they were employed.21. So far as wages are concerned, Award 728 deals primarily with base rates. Previous to the Award the war bonus of railway shopmen had followed the war bonus in the engineering industry, but after the Court &apos;s decision the reason for following the engineering trade lost its force, and during the latter part of 1922 the war bonus was reduced by only 10s., from 265. 6d. to 16s. 6d., whereas the engineering war bonus was reduced by 16s. Qd., from 26s. 6d. to 10s. per week. Since 1922 the railway companies have endeavoured to get the various Unions concerned to agree to a further reduction in the war bonus of the railway shopmen, but they have not been successful, with the result that the bonus still stands at 16s. 6d. per week.22. The question of the rates of pay of railway shopmen has again been raised by the National Union of Railwaymen in their &quot;all grades&quot; programme. In this their demands include a proposal that all grading of mechanics in the railway shops should be abolished, and that a flat rate of  4 should be established, applicable to all men who have been five years at the trade; semi-skilled men are to receive a basic rate of 70s., and.unskilled men  3 a week. At the meeting between the Railways Staff Conference and the National Union of Railwaymen and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association on the 3rd February, 1925, the Railway Managers informed the National Union of Railwaymen that, so far as the demands in regard to railway shopmen were concerned, they were unable to negotiate with the National Union of Railwaymen alone, as the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Boilermakers&apos; Society, the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades and other Craft Unions repre-sented the majority of the skilled men in the railway shops, and were therefore affected. The Railway Managers could therefore only negotiate on a claim affecting-railway shopmen with all the Unions concerned and not with only one Union.23. Apart from the general difficulties arising out of the rivalry between the National Union of Railwaymen and the Craft Unions (see paragraph 19), there is one other question affecting the railway shopmen with might have led to a serious position at the present time. As stated above, Award 728 has been put into operation on all the railways with the exception of the Great Central Section of the London and North-Eastern Railway, but it only came into operation on the Great Northern Section of this Railway on the 2nd March, 1925. Following repeated requests by the National Union of Railwaymen for the Award to be put into operation on the Great Northern Section, there was a possibility of a serious dispute arising, with the result that the Minister of Labour appointed, in March 1924, a Court of Inquiry to inquire into the threatened dispute and to ascertain and report on the facts in connection therewith. The Court reported to the Minister on the 15th April, 1924, to the effect that it was their opinion that Award 728 should be applied to the Great Northern Section, but that it should not be put into operation earlier than the 1st March, 1925. The Court also expressed the opinion that, before the terms and conditions of the Award were applied, the Railway Company and all the Trade Unions concerned should negotiate and agree upon all the necessary details involved in such applica-tion, and differences, if any, should be brought to the notice of and decided by the Industrial Court before the date when the terms of the decision actually commenced to operate.24. Following the report of the Court of Inquiry, the Railway Company opened negotiations with the various Unions concerned, with a view to the application of the Award as from the 2nd March, 1925. Differences arose over the question of the classification of towns and the rates for labourers, and these were recently referred to the Industrial Court for decision. Although the Amalgamated Engineering Union, who were not parties to Award 728, and have opposed its application to their members, attended the hearing before the Industrial Court in regard to the classifi-cation of towns, they did so on the understanding that they had not agreed to accept the application of the Award to the Great Northern, and, as they failed to get the
Court to place Doncaster, where the main workshops are situated, in Class I, it was anticipated that they might refuse to accept the application of the Award on the 2nd March, and call out their members at Doncaster and the other workshops on the Great Northern. In this connection, it should be mentioned that there is an offensive and defensive alliance between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, so that, if the skilled men in the workshops of the Great Northern had ceased work, it is quite possible that, they would have been supported by the locomotive drivers and firemen. Mainly owing to the tactful handling of the situation by the Railway Company, the applica-tion of the Award has been effected without any stoppage of work, and, although there are still a number of difficulties outstanding, including, in particular, differences with the Boilermakers&apos; Society regarding the rates for rivetters, platers, &amp;c, it is not anticipated that these will prove incapable of settlement, and it is confidently expected that a position which has been a menace to peace on the Great Northern for many months will very shortly be finally cleared up.Events in the Engineering Industry will doubtless affect the Railway Shopmen position.25. It will be seen that, although there are many possibilities of a serious position arising at any time in the near future on the railways, there is no need, on the whole, to be apprehensive of the position at the moment.Ministry of Labovrr, March 5, 1925.
