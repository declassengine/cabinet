CABINET.SECRET.CP.  188(25).FACTORIES    BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I circulate to my colleagues a White Paper reprint of the Factories Bill introduced last year by the Labour Government in which the substantial additions to,  or alterations in,  the existing law are indicated by black lines.    In substance the Bill is based on the Bill which Mr, Bridgeman had under consideration when the Conservative Government went out of Office in the Winter of 1923-4,  hut which was never before the Cabinet,  and the important alterations made in the Bill by Mr. Henderson after the change of Government have been marked in red in the copies I am circulating.These changes will be found.in clauses 9(2),   12,  ST,  45,  51,  54,  55,The Bill which was being prepared by Mr. Bridgeman was both a consolidating Bill and an amending Bill,  and the amendments were numerous and important.    As my colleagues will be aware, more than twenty-three years have elapsed since the principal Act at present in force - the Factory and Workshop Act,  1901 - was passed,  and no general amending legislation has been undertaken during that interval, though a number of minor Acts amending or extending the principal Act on particular points have been passed.    On the other hand,  during that period there has been a great development both in the investigation of the conditions of health and safety in industry and in the application of new methods for securing the protection and welfare of the workers.    For instance,  during that period,  almost the whole of the large body of regulations for dangerous and unhealthy trades has grown up and the entire series of Home Office Welfare Orders under the Police Factories 6c. Act,  1916, has been issued.    Again,  the war has brought about great changes and given rise to new movements in industry.    For example, the hours of work in factories and workshops have been revolutionised, by the Introduction86,  91.of
of trie eight-hour day by agreement,  and the provisions in the Act of 1901 which regulate the hours of employment of women and young persons have become obsolete.    In many other respects the provisions of the Act of 1901 are now out of date.    In the main the amendments proposed in the Bill prepared under Mr. Bridgeman&apos;s instructions did no more than give effect on the one hand to improvements which had been recommended by a series of Committees on various questions of health and safety,  or had been suggested by the investigations and experience of the Department itself;    and on the other hand to actual changes in factory practice which had been introduced by the industries themselves, as, for example,  the change in the hours of work.    The Bill was introduced in May of last year and has been carefully studied by the organisations both of employers and workers, and a large number of representations have been received.    These have been cafefully examined by my Department and the Bill has been revised to meet some of the difficulties of substance which have been pointed out.It is only right, however, that my colleagues should know that the chief representations which have come to me from the employers&apos; side, namely from the National Confederation of Employers1 Organisations, make a sustained attack both on most of the important features of the Bill and on many of Its details,    They criticise chiefly the following pointsthe abolition of the distinction between factories and workshops;the extension of factory legislation to classes of premises at present outside,  or partially outside,  the Factory Acts, e.g, engineering works, building operations,  ship repairing;the general application of particular requirements,   such as welfare requirements, which have hitherto been applied by means of orders to particular cases only;the alleged extension given by the Bill to the powers of the Secretary of State and the Department;the introduction of the 48-hour week for women and young personsthe
the interference with the hours of work of adult males by-such clauses as the weekly rest day clause  (45)., the night baking clause  (54).Generally they contend that the effect of the Bill will be to add greatly to the  charge placed on industry by factory, legislation, and in this connection 1 quote the following passage from their memorandum:&quot;It cannot be questioned that the  cost involved by existing factory legislation, more especially in some industries, constitutes a material element in the total cost of production. In every industry the element of cost would have been seriously increased if the provisions of the Bill  (that is the Labour Government&apos;s Bill) had been brought into force.    British employers have not asked to be relieved of that element of cost, but having regard to the advanced state of social legislation in this country,  they do respectfully submit that a stage has been reached when further requirements cannot be imposed without clear proof of their necessity and practicability. - Employers feel that in these circumstances the onus of proof as to necessity and practicability lies upon any Government which proposes to recast on a higher standard the existing factory legislation of this country.&quot;Ho doubt a great deal of the criticism directed against the Bill in the memorandum submitted to me by the Confederation is exaggerated and misplaced, and a good deal of misapprehension exists as to the effect of various provisions in the Bill,  but it is a  , factor with which we have to reckon in any attempt to pass a Bill on the general lines proposed.    I should have been glad personally to have had a longer time in which to study the measure,  to consult with the representatives both of employers and of workers and to familiarise myself with its practical application by visiting a number of the industrial centres in the  country.    At the same  time the Bill has now heen for a long&apos; time before the public,  and 1 recognise the political advantages in passing the Bill at an early date.    Prom a Departmental point of view also I am advised that itis
is desirable that tire Bill should pass at an early date.    There are many matters in respect of which important aotion is being delayed by want of the necessary powers.Another factor of importance,  if an attempt is to be made to pass the Bill this Session,  is that of time.    The Bill is a long one of some  140 clauses,  and we must expect that the discussion in Committee will last several weeks at least.    Several days also will probably be required for Report Stage.    In order to get the Bill through this Session we ought to make very substantial progress with the Committee Stage before the Whitsun holidays  (Whit-Sunday is the 31st May).    That would involve taking a Second Reading very soon after the Easter recess and the Bill should be brought in either before the Easter reoess or immediately after - preferably the former.    The Bill is ready for introduction on short notice, provided its main outlines are not substantially changed.If the Cabinet decide in favour of introducing the Bill at once and passing it this Session,  there are a number of points on which I must have their decision.The most important question on which I wish the opinion of the Cabinet is that of the hours of work for women and young persons. The existing law allows for all factories and workshops other than textile factories,  a 10-f--hour day, exclusive of meals,  and a 60-hour week, a 5-hour spell of work and overtime in certain industries.    In textile factories the legal hours are somewhat shorter,  a 10-hour day and a 5&amp;g-hour week,  a 4^--hour spell and no overtime.    It was proposed in Mr. Bridgeman1s Bill as well as in the Labour Governments Bill to substitute for these hours a 9-hour day, a 48-hour week,  a 4^--hour spell, and an allowance for overtime in the same classes of industry as under the existing Act.    The working week of 48-hours or less is now general throughout the country and the provisions in the existing Factory Acts as to hours of employment have in consequence become obsolete, and it would be very difficult to re-enact them in the new measure. Assuming, however,  that the existing provisions must be modified -unless they are omitted altogether -* it is difficult to see whatsystem
system could be substituted for them except one which corresponds approximately to the actual practice of today.    Any other system that may be devised would be purely arbitrary and would be difficult to defend on any grounds of actual practice or experienced-It is contended by the Confederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations that if the hours of work of women and young persons are limited by Statute to 9 hours a day and 48 hours a week,  the effect would be to limit to the same extent the hours of men employed in the same industries.    It may be observed, however,  that the men are already working the shorter hours and that it will only be in cases where longer hours have to be worked on account of pressure of orders or for other reasons and where there is no allowance, or only an insufficient allowance, for overtime for women and young persons, that any difficulty can arise.     (In the iron and steel industries and other important industries where work is carried on continuously by a succession of 8-hour shifts,  that difficulty would of course not arise.)    The question of hours should be considered therefore with the question of the overtime provisions. Under the existing Acts young persons under 18 (male or female) are not permitted to work overtime,   but a restricted amount of overtime is allowed to women in certain non-textile industries which are subject to seasonal pressure, etc.    On the other hand the present difference between the actual-48-hour week which is being worked and the  statutory 60-hour week allowed by the Factory Acts gives the employer a margin which he can utilise for overtime purposes for young persons as well as for women on occasions of emergency or special pressure.    The amount of overtime proposed to be allowed by the Labour Governments Bill  (45 hours annually in industries- liable to seasonal or unforeseen pressure and 75 in industries handling perishable materials) has been strongly criticised by a number of employers&apos;  organisations as insufficient to meet the legitimate requirements of the various trades.    It is possible to meet these representations hy increasing the amount of overtime and I should propose to do this,  but this will not remove the whole difficulty.    In cases where the work of men is dependenton
on the work of boys the overtime work of the men will be hampered if the boys have to stop.    This is a difficulty which arose of course under the old system,  and was got over in one way or another.    There would doubtless be a great outcry if a proposal were made to restore overtime for young persons  (which was abolished in 1895) or even for male  young persons under 16,  but if the point is strongly pressed by the industries it may be necessary to make  some provision for cases where special circumstances exist and where the work of the men is dependent on the work of the boys. It could be pointed out in support of such provision that it is permissible under the Washington Hours Convention.There is another method by which relief could be given to the employers,  and that is by the two-shift system.    This system allows the employment of two shifts of women and young persons over 16,  in the day.    The shifts must not average more than 8 hours a day and must be fitted in between 6 a.m.  and 10 p.m.    Thus one shift might work from 6 a.m.  to 2 p.m.  and the other from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. The system was made a part,  though only temporarily,  of our factory system by the Employment of Women,  Young Persons and Children Act, 1920,  and will,  unless re-enacted,  expire at the end of the present year.    Owing to depression of trade as much use has not been made of the system as was expected,- though a considerable number of orders have In fact been applied for  and granted.    The Factory Inspectors report favourably on its working so far as their experience has gone,  and If the  limitation of hours to 48 in the week is decided upon there will be a strong case for making the two-shift system a permanent part of our Factory Acts.    It provides the employer with the means of working the  longer hours that his business may require during pressure without placing a strain on growing boys,  and at the  same  time has the merit of increasing the number of persons employed.The real fight of course Is on the question of Foreign competition.    Our employers say they cannot meet this when limited by a 48 hour week unless foreigners do so too.    I am inclined to adopt this Clause on condition that our competitors say,  France,Germany,
Germany, Belgium dec.  do so also on the lines which will shortly come before the Cabinet in the report of the Committee on the International Labour Office Convention.I should much like the views of the President of the Board of Trade on this and similar points in the Bill.I also submit for the  decision of the Cabinet the followingpointsSome objection has been taken to the proposal in the Bill to remove the old distinction between factories and workshops (i.e. roughly, places where power machinery is used and places where power machinery is not used respectively^ and to treat all workshops as factories.    This distinction has in fact largly lost its meaning - in recent years in particular the extensive introduction of small power plants or electric motors has converted numbers of small &quot;workshops&apos;  into &quot;factories&apos;.    Further, the only substantial difference of treatment made by the existing Acts between them are that  (l) in Workshops the sanitary condition is looked after by the local authority instead of by the Factory Inspector,   (2) young persons do not require before being employed in workshops to be examined and certified, as to their fitness for employment,(3) workshops in which men only are employed are exempted from certain provisions of the Acts.    As regards  (1),  the work is often very inadequately done by the smaller local authorities^s^and it is proposed to transfer it to the Inspector^ who )3%AVe to visit the workshops for many other purposes, including certain sanitary purposes,  and when so doing is required to satisfy himself as to the sanitary condition generally.    In those larger towns where the work is well done,  it will be left with the local authority.    As regards  (2) the present system of certification which works very unsatisfactorily is to be radically altered by the Bill.    As regards  (3),  it has long been recognized that the exemption of men&apos;s workshops from the provisions of the Act as to ventilation,  temperature,  drainage of floors,   sanitary conveniences,  inquests,  &quot;Particulars&quot;,  posting of abstract of the Acts, &amp;c. was anomalous.The
The present distinctions between textile factory,  non-textile factory,  workshop, men&apos;s workshop.&amp;c.  greatly complicate    the Acts and it will be a great gain from the point of view of simplification to have only one  class and to make,  where necessary,  exceptions for places where no power machinery is employed or the like.Clause 5 increases the  cubic space per worker in a workroom from 250 feet to 400.    It has been represented that this will press hardly on many works where extension of premises is impossible and may involve the displacement of machinery or workers.    The standard of 250 cubic feet is undoubtedly a very low one and in the vast majority of factories the higher standard is already being observed,  but my Department inform me that there are a number of small works, especially workshops,  which will find it difficult to comply with the higher standard,  and they are disposed to recommend that the higher standard should only apply to new factories.Clause  12.  This  is a new provision inserted by Mr. Henderson,  the object of which is to enable the  Secretary of State to take  action in the case of factories or classes of factories where sickness or a low standard of health is&apos; found to prevail,  though there is nothing substantially dangerous or injurious in the processes carried on Avhich will warrant the making of regulations for the industry.    A good instance of this kind of case is the boot and shoe trade where the  incidence of tuberculosis is high.    The printing trade is another instance. A similar clause was accepted by Mr. Bridgeman in his Workmen1s Compensation Bill of 1923    (with general approval)  in respect of the prevention of accidents.    That clause is being re-enacted in clause 34 of the present Bill.    A movement is beginning in this country,  of which we shall probably hear more,  for the introduction of medical supervision of the workers in our factories from the point of view of the effect of the occupation on their health. Any general scheme of the kind seems to be out of the question under present conditions,  but a provision on the lines suggested in the Bill will enable the Government to take  action in special
oases and to olaim that they have met the real necessities of the case.Clause Slo    This clause lays down a number of requirements,  based on the  investigations and experience of the Factory Department,  to secure safety in the working of hoists and lifts.    They do not go beyond what are accepted now as safe practice and are already widely adopted.    It is recognised that in some  cases where arrangements are not in accordance with present day standards the necessary structural alterations may entail a good deal of expense,  but the number of accidents yearly with hoists and lifts is heavy in proportion to the number of persons working them -in 1923 there were 376 accidents,  of which 24 were fatal. Provided that employers are treated considerately,  as they would be by the Department,  and are given sufficient time in which, to carry out the necessary alterations the Department thinks the clause is one which the Government should retain, I    may add that 1 propose to amend the  clause  so as to make it clear that it is not intended to apply to certain special classes of lifts,   such as blast furnace lifts, platform :hoists,  hand lifts,  etc.,  about which some special apprehension has been expressed by the employers.Clause 57. .   Strong objection has been taken to thisclause on the ground that it places an excessive- power,which may be used in an arbitrary manner,   in the hands ofthe Factory Inspector.    This is not really the case.    the employer,  if he disagrees with the view of the Inspector,has the right to take the matter before a referee for decision.    The clause follows a section which has beenin force for many years in the Coal Mines Regulation. Actsand which has worked there without any friction orhardship.    Some provision of the kind is wanted to&apos; enable
enable the Department to deal with various dangerous practices In factories which are not covered by any provisions in the Acts and which, from their miscellaneous character,   could hardly be dealt with by a statutory provision.    Instances of cases which have come under the  consideration of the Department are the dangerous stacking of goods or material;     dangerous methods of working slag heaps at blast furnaces;    insufficient cleaning of benzine tanks before repair work;    insecure shoring of the timber in excavation work;    soaking of celluloid sheets in spirit in a room in which there was a fire;Clause 59.    The proposal in subclause 2 to fix a standard of 1 basin for every 10 persons employed has been objected to by many employers.    It is claimed that a large proportion of the workers will not make use of the accommodation and that a standard of 1 in 50 would meet all reasonable requirements.    It is no d.doubt the case that many of the workers will not use the accommodation, and I should be disposed to make  some  concession on the point.    The standard of one in 50,  however, seems to be too low.Clause
Clause 45.    This clause was introduced by Mr. Henderson and is based on a Draft Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 1931.      It represents the existing practice in factories in this country, but it has aroused a good deal of opposition from the employers.      This opposition was certainly in part due, and perhaps mainly due, to the fact that it was not understood that the power of exemption given by subclauso 2 was intended to provide for cases whore work had necessarily to be done over the weekend, in order to keep an industry going, e.g. repair work, Installation of new machinery,  shift work, and the like.      The clause, however,  is not necessary to secure to British workers the benefits of the weekly rest, as they already have it, and as it it is not intended to ratify the Weekly Rest Day Convention,, at any rate until other countries have done so, there is no special object in keeping it in the Bill.Clause 54.    This clause for the prohibition of night baking was inserted by Mr. Henderson.      It givos effect to the rocommenda-tions of the Departmental Committee on Nightwork in Baking, which reported in 1919.     The question is a very controversial one;    the employers in tho baking trade are strongly opposed to the olauso, As my colleagues are aware,  the question has also come up In connection with a Convention proposed to be adopted by the International Labour Organisation, and Sir Auckland G-eddes&apos;s Commission has been asked to investigate the question whether the prohibition of night baking would add to the increase of the cost of the loaf as is claimed by the master bakers.      Pending a report from the Commission and further consideration of the matter by the Cabinet the clause would-be premature, and I propose to omit it.Clause 55.      This clause was also one of those inserted by Mr. Henderson.      The matter has been inquired into by a Departmental Committee which could find no direct evidence of injury to health arising from the practice, but reported that local opinion was overwhelmingly opposed to the practice on tho ground of its uncleanliness.     A Trade Committee which reported in 1919 wero also unanimous in recommending that shuttlo-kissing should be abolished.
abolished.      The practice, however,  still continues, though in some mills hand-threaded shuttles have been successfully substituted.      The main difficulty appears to be that the employers think the substitution of the hand-threaded shuttle will tend to reduce the earnings of the operatives and are unwilling to make a change unless the operations&apos;  organisations are willing to guarantee that no claim for increase of wages will be made.      I am disposed to think that  the best course would be to omit the clause and let it be brought up by a Private Member in Committee.Clause 58.    This clause is based on a Bill  (called the Underground Workrooms Bill) which was introduced in 1913 in the House of Lords by Lord Salisbury and which proposed that under-ground rooms In certain classes of factories or workshops should not be used unless thoy had been certified to be suitable.      This Bill was very favourably received and I am advised that   there are strong grounds for special powers to regulate the use of under-ground rooms for factory employment.      The Confederation of Employers1  Organisation has objected to the clause, but the clause is an important one.      Safeguards are provided against any arbitrary action by the Inspector.      The proposal in Lord Salisbury&apos;s Bill was much stronger.      It prohibited the use of any underground workroom until it had been certified to bo suitable.      In the present Bill the use of an underground room is not prohibited unless it has boon certified by the Inspector of Factories to be unsuitable.Clause 98.      This clause is to enable tho Department tosecure decent conditions of work and to take measures for theprevention of accidents in connection with certain operations on ships while in harbours or wot dooks whero tho Factory Acts atprssent do not apply.      These operations are  (l) the cleaning ofbilges and boilers and scurfing and scaling of boilers;    (R)structural and other work which, if the ship were in a dry dockor shipbuilding yard, would be subject to the Acts and which isattended
attended with, risks for which no precautions at present oan he required;    and (3) the breaking up of *ships, which has given rise to numerous oases of lead and other kinds of poisoning among the workers employed.     As regards bilge cleaning, boiler scaling, etc., the work is largely done by boys, often under very trying and disagreeable conditions.      Protective clothing is only r&amp;rely provided.      In some oases the hours worked are excessive, and facilities for obtaining meals,forjdrying clothes and for shelter during intervals of work are reported to me to be urgently required. The question of the conditions under whi*h these boys have to work has been raised on many occasions in Parliament during the last few years.     As regards structural work on ships in harbour or wat dock, the need    of further precautions ha3 recently been reported on by a Departmental Committee, presided over by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for my Department, and including representatives both of employers and employed, who have unanimously recommended the extension of the necessary provisions in the Acts to this work.      Considerable objection has been taken, however,, to the power proposed to be given to the Seoretary of State to apply by special order  (that is an order subject to review by Parliament) such provisions as he thinks necessary, and I am proposing if possible to set out on the face of the Bill the clauses to be applied.The Shipping industry I am informed intend to fight this clause tooth and nail but they are not very powerful in the House,Clause 99.      The proposal to bring certain classes of engineering works under some of the provisions of the Factory Acts is objected to in the memorandum of the Confederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations.      This is a question which has been under consideration for a long time.      There is no power at present to make any regulations for the prevention of accidents or to safeguard the health of the persons employed on ^ig works of construction, and a Home Office Committee whioh was appointed in 1910, in consequence of two very serious acoidents in deep excavation work, to inquire into the dangers attending on suchworka^BWWMWWMtttMl^^ &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
30th March,  1925.work recommended in their Report  (Cd. 6261) that precautions should be required on a number of points and that powers of inspection should be given to the Factory Department. Objection is also taken to the extension of the Acts to building operations;    but the factory Act&quot;1901 already applies to building operations which are being carried on by aid of madhinery. and the effect of the clause is only to bring in building operations where machinery is not used.      This extension was unanimously recommended by the Home Office Committee on Building Accidents which was appointed in 1901 and which contained representatives both of master builders and of operatives, and, as far as the Home Office is aware, is till accepted by the industry, who are in process of settling a general code of safety regulations for all building operations with the Home Office,These are the main objections though the Employers perhaps naturally dislike the whole Bill still I think we can rely upon the undivided support of Lady Astor, Lord Henry Bentinck and the Labour Party which will enable us to vote down the opposition of some of our own side.W.J.H.
