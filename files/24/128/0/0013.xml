(This Dogranent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government!]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1921.SECRET.CP.-3314.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF  IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 12th September.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.Although on the whole the country remains undisturbed the number of breaches of the truce shows an increase which is somewhat disquieting. The most serious cases occurred at Bandon, co. Cork, where on the 7th instant a soldier of the Essex Regiment was kidnapped; he succeeded in effecting his escape three days later. In the early morning of the 8th instant a sentry on duty outside the Police barracks was fired at by three men at close range. He was not hit, and returned the fire. A further incident of a serious &quot;nature occurred at this place on the 9th instant, when for the second time two Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary were kidnapped. In my survey for the week ended the 29th August, I dealt with the events which.led up to the kidnapping of two Constables on the 23rd August. These men subsequently escaped from Sinn Fein custody, and the later outrage on two other Constables is a sequel. The men are being released forthwith. Another case in which two Constables were kidnapped is reported from co. Roscommon. These men were seized while on leave in the Strokestown District on the 12th instant, and were rescued later on the same day by Royal Irish Constabulary. Three men who were guarding the Constables were&quot; detained.An escort of the I.R.A. men arrived at Annaghs, Dundalk District, on the 6th instant, in charge of the remains of a male civilian who is thought to have met his death in a disturbance which occurred outside Armagh after the meeting addressed by Michael Collins on the 4th instant. The relatives refused to give the Police any information, and declined to allow them to examine the body on the ground that the matter was in the hands of the I.R.A. Another sequel to this meeting was the wounding of two civilians who were returning home in motor cars;. neither case, however, is serious. It appears that a Unionist crowd jeered and threw stones at the occupants of the cars, one of whom thereupon fired. The crowd replied, and in all about sixty shots were exchanged. Armagh was also the scene of an attempt to derail a train. This outrage took place on the 12th instant, but the attempt was unsuccessful, and no one was injured.Other breaches of the truce reported during the week include 20 illegal arrests of civilians. A raid on mails, a case of cattle-stealing, and one of malicious hay burning also appear to come into, this category. The removal of the Standard Weights and Measures from the Ballickmoyler Court House, Abbeyleix District, on the eve of a general test, must also be recorded as a deliberate act of Police obstruction.State of Belfast.No actual disturbances have occurred in Belfast during the week, but an atmosphere of unrest still prevails and a general feeling of nervousness is apparent in both parties. A notable development took place on the 9th instant, when a number of representative Unionists and Nationalists in the York Street district, the scene of recent rioting, met at the Police Barracks and agreed to use their influence towards the prevention of disorder. This agreement has probably not been without its influence, but to herald it as an&quot; Unofficial Truce,&quot; as certain[6948]
newspapers did, is to exaggerate its usefulness. There is no doubt that party-feeling still runs dangerously high.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.One trial of a civilian by court-martial was reported during the week. The charge was attempting to escape from a place of internment, and a sentence of 1 year&apos;s imprisonment with hard labour was inflicted.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 10th instant.Total orders made .. ... ... ...      4,245Orders cancelled for reasons other than release        162 Releases ordered ... ... ... ...       428-        590Number of persons now interned    ...         ... ...      3,655The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 29.State of the Police Forces.The following figures show the present strength of the Irish Police Forces : Royal Irish Constabulary.Regular Force.Strength on the 4th September, 1921      ...         ... ...    14,062Deaths during week        ...         ...         ...

Present Political Situation in Ireland.Though somewhat bewildered by the unexpected discussion between the Prime Minister and the Irish envoys on the 13th instant, the Nationalist press has shown unwillingness to give the incident a sinister significance, and the &quot; Independent,&quot; which has been associated most intimately with Sinn Fein policy, has again laid stress on the fervent desire for peace and security. In this there is no doubt that it still expresses the feeling by which practically the whole country is animated. While, however, there is a general eagerness for an early conference of plenipotentiaries, there has been no manifestation of impatience nor any indication of the possibility of a moderate &quot; cave &quot; either in the inner circles of Sinn Fein or in the country.H.
