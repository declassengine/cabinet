McGEATHMR. BOLAHDsir edward griggMr McGrath and Mr Boland arrived about 5.15 and delivered aletter from Mr de Valera which was immediately opened and read bythe Prime Minister.   The letter was as follows:-&quot;Sir,     We have no hesitation in declaring our willingness &apos;to enter a conference to ascertain how the association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the British Empire can best be reoonciled with Irish national aspirations&apos;. Our readiness to contemplate such an association was indicate-ed in our letter of August 10th.    We have accordingly summcn-ed Dail Bireann that we may submit to it for ratification the names of the representatives it is our intention to propose. We hope that these representatives will find it possible to &quot;be at Inverness on the date you suggest, September 20th.In this final note we deem it our duty to reaffirm that our position is and can only be as we have defined it through -out this correspondence.    Our nation has formally declared its independence and recognises itself as a sovereign State. It is only as the representatives of that State and as its chosen guardians that we have any authority or powers to act on behalf of our people.As regards the principle of 1 government hy consent of the governed&quot;, in the very nature of things it must be the basis of any agreement that will achieve the purpose we nave at heart, that is, the final reconciliation of our nation with yours.   We have suggested no interpretation of that principle save its every-day interpretation, the sense, for example, in which, it was understood by the plain men and women of the world when on January 5th, 1918, you said:&apos;....The settlement of the new Europe must be based on such grounds of reason and justice as will give 3omo promise of stability.   Therefore it is that we feel that government with the consent of the governed must he the basis of any territorial settlement in this war.vThese words are the true answer to the criticism of our position which your last letter puts forward.    The principle was understood then to mean the right of nations that had been annexed to empires against their will to free themselves from the grappling hook.    That is the sense in v/hich we understand
;** &quot;it.     In reality it is your Government, when it seeks to rend our ancient nation and to partition its territory, that would give t o the prinaiplcjan interpretation that would undermine the fabric of every democratic state and drive the civilised world hack Into tribalism1.i am, Sir,Faithfully yours,Eamon de Valera.&quot;THE PRIME MIKiaEER, after reading it, said at once that thosecond paragraph made it impossible for him to hold the suggest--ed conference at Inverness nest week.   He explained that he had 3done his very utmost to make it possible for Mr de Valera to come, but it was absolutely out of the question that he should consent to moet Mr de Valera and his colleagues in conference as the representatives of a foreign power like Prance or Germany.   Even if he were willing to do it himself - which he was not - his action would not he tolerated by the oountry.   There was no British statesman of whatever party who could enter a conference with leaders of Sinn fein on such terms.     He had no objection to any part of the letter except the second para-graph, although, of course, he did not agree with the argument regarding &quot;government by consent of the governed.&quot;     He.did not in the least mind the quotation from his own speech of January 1918.    It was a good controversial score, and - he repeated -he did. not mind it in the very least, but the second paragraph was different; he could not express his objection to it too strongly.    It made it impossible for him to hold the caference. Why had Mr de Valera put that paragraph in?MR. McGRATH said that Mr de Valera had had great difficulties with his own people, and that it was o&amp;ly by inserting language of this kind that he would probably be able to get the support of all his followers.     He begged the prime minister to remember? Mr de Valerars difficulties- which wero very considerable.THE PRIME MJIISTBB replied that he had always shewn the greatest consideration for Mr de Valera1 s difficulties.   He under-stoooyfchem perfectly, and he would never have gone to the lengths which he had in order to meet him unless he had appreciated to the full the obstacles which Mr de Xalcra had to overcome.   It was, however, absolutely impossible to go any further than he
ffcrious.    IE3ie--lktoUa*n^i3^        oaawtfuaJ^MtSWQ^  term Association&apos; in order to help Mr de Yalera to accepts-their terrlfa&quot; ation.   He refused all help and went out of his way to*-Jreas&amp;ert a position whioh he-toiew^ould. never he accepted by any British Government-and -which he had--already aasertod in all previous o ommunlc ati ons.ME BOLAJKD intersected that Mr de Valera had done his best to overcome his diffioultics.THE PRIME MINISTER asked what he had done.   So far every single, concession had been made by the British Government and not a single concession had been made on the side of the Irish.   He had very great experience of conference and negotiation, with many different nations, ariSfche had never met representatives of any nation who were so difficult to deal with as Mr de Valera and his colleagues.        Their idea of negotiation appeared to be that the other side should make all the concessions and that they should, simply adhere to thelx-original-position.   Thau was not the way to do business.   It would lead them to ruin.   The tragedy of Irolaad&apos; at present was that there was not a single -man of experience...among the Sinn Eein leaders.   They might-be-very clever sen, but th^sr had absolutely n* -experieaae.   If they had any glimmer of exper-iance they would have known that he (the Prime Minister) had done his utmost, and that to reitorate this.... claim to sovereignty must make- -oonfererKje-impossLble.MR mcgrath &quot;asked whether Mr Lloyd George co-aid not overlook this paragraph until they got into the conference.   He said it was voxy easy to settle tb.ings---acr-o.ss a. table but very hard to make &quot;concessions beforehand on paper.     He begged the Prime Minister to let the oonfererjoe meet and to overlook the second paragraph in the letter.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he would not do so if he could, and he could not do so if he would.   It shewed their utter lack of experience that they should come to him with such a suggestion.   They seemed to think that they were the only people
&quot;iii l&amp;e^^ and great difficulties.     Hobegged, them to understand that the strong feelings and the difficulties wera not all on their side.The people of Great Britain had shewn-wonderful forbearance and great generosity* but their temper was being very sorely tried, and he had received many telegrams ana letters to shew that feeling was rising very strong-ly against any further discussion of tho extreme demands of Sinn Fein.   He was not in the least surprised at this   in spite of his desire for a settlement, which had made him. go all this length to meet Mr de Valera, he found it very hard to preserve a remnant of patience with Mr do Valora&apos;s proceedings.0*he Prime Minister then withdrew to consider his course of action, asking the Irish representatives to wait for his answer.He Returned in five minutes and said that he could only tfepeai - if possible even more strongly - what he had already said.   He would not meet Mr de Valera as the representative of a foreign power.   He felt that there was not a single man with experience amongst them at the Mansion House, and that they, had, by this letter, made the conference absolutely impossible.MS McGRATH asked if this was absolutely final.TH3 PRIMS MIlTISTSR replied that it was.   Ho could only make two suggestions.    On the one hand, if they liked, he would givo them back the letter and treat it -as &quot;if he had never received it; they.&apos; in the meanwhile, communicating his observations on it to Dublin; or else, if they preferred it, he would keep the lettor but would not publish the fact that he had received it, and would allow them time in Dublin to think better of it.   He was perfect-ly Beady for cither of these courses, but they must understand that if Mr do Valora persisted in the attitude shewn by the second paragraph of the letter that conference would be absolutely impossible.The Irish delegates asked time to consider these tw* alternatives, and were left to themselves to do so.   After an interval of about 5 minutes they explained that thoy preferred thg
sWnad-A2rtwmtiYe.   They would return to Dublin immediately la order to tell Mr do Valera what the Prime Minister had said to them, and undertook to oemmunioate again on Friday or Saturday.They asked whether they should send counters again to delivor tho-answer, or whether they might communicate it through Mr Cope hy telegraph,THE PRIME MINISTER said that they might communicate it to Mr Cope, who would be Instructed to hand it te the Viceroy to be forwarded by telegraph Immediately.   Ho again repeated that they must understand themselves, and make it perfectly clear to Mr de Valera, that the conference would not be held unless he eliminated the second paragraph of his letter.   Assuming that, and provided he received their reply by Friday, he would be prepared to moot them in conference, as originally suggested, at imromoss tn Tuesday -the 20th,   If their reply was not received till Sattirday he would prefer that the conference should not meet at Inverness till Thursday the and.   They agreed to this, and asked the Prime Minister to assist them In getting the necessary accommodation. He replied that he would do so and enquired how many delegates they would send.   They said probably five.   They then asked what the Prime Minister would tell the Press.   By the Prime Minister1 a instructions the- following communique was drafted and accepted by them;-&quot;Mr mcgrath and Mr Boland had an interview with Mr Lloyd George *his afternton, and discussed some points in reference to the Conference suggested in the british Governments last communication.   They are returning to Dublin with Mr Ll*yd George&apos;s views for further consideration.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said he would mako no conmunieatien what-ever of having received a letter, and understood that they would do the same.   They said they would be very careful that no montienof the delivery of a letter was made nn their side.*The Irish representatives then withdrew, the prime Minister repeating ikxx as they left that he wished them to report every-thing that he had said most carefully and completely toMr de Valera.-
It was noticeable throughout the interview that both Irish representatives were anxious for a oonferenoe.   They almost begged the Prime Minister to overlook their phrases and to let them meet him round a tablo in spite of them.   They shewed no resentment whatever at the very strong observations which he Aaude, and they gave the impression that they, at any rate, would do their utmost to secure the elimination of the second paragraph from the letter.   It must, however^ in justice to them be n&amp;de perfectly clear that they said more than once that they had no authority to discuss or interpret the letter, and were merely acting as couriers.GairlochSeptember 13th 1921
