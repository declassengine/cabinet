ALFRED MOND.13th October, 1921.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT * SECRET CABINET.C.P.3400. ECONOMY IN NATIONAL EXPENDITURE. M.H.40.MHvlORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a copy of a Memorandum which I have submitted to the Treasury.
TREASURY CIRCULAR ON ECONOMY.In the previous memoranda by the Minister of Health on the question of reductions on the Estimates of the Ministry in 1922-3 it was pointed out that there was considerable uncertainty as regards the liability under the scheme of subsidy to private builders and that the estimate taken for the purpose of the 1922-3 forecast, which was made in July, was highly conjectural.At the time this forecast was made it was anticipated that not more than 25,000 houses would qualify for grant.    About 31,000 houses had been provisionally certified by local authorities before 23rd December, 1920, when the provisions of the Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919, ceased to have effect, but of these only 15,000 houses had been completed and it was thought that a large number of the provisional certificates would bo cancelled under the provisions of the Housing Act, 1921, on the ground that building had not begun before 1st July, 1921. Nothing was known, also, of the extent to which building, in anticipation of the extension of the subsidy, had been begun during the period between the two Acts, but it was not considered that it would amount to very much.     Further, no estimate could be made of the extent to which private builders would take advantage of the concession subsequently made by the Government under which subsidy could be earned where commitments had been entered into before 15th July, 1921, and building was actually begun within 6 weeks of that date.From the Information now available, it is clear that the number of houses which will qualify for grant will very largely exceed the number which seemed probable whenthe/
the previous estimates were made.     In all, provisional certificates have been Issued for 46,000 houses and only 4,500 certificates have been cancelled.     It is possible that some of the houses for which provisional certificates have been Issued will not be proceeded with, but It Is reasonably clear that provision must be made for at least 40,000 houses under the Scheme.Tie total liability must, therefore, be put at not less than  10,000,000 for England and Wales.     It is not possible to state with any accuracy how many of the 40,000 houses will be completed in time for payment of the subsidy in the current financial year but it would seem to be fairly certain that at least  2,500,000 will be required In 1922-3 for this purpose.In the forecast of the 1922-3 Estimates made in July the provisional figure inserted for housing was  9,400,000 net, of which not more than  500,000 would be available for private builders&apos; subsidy.It win now be necessary, therefore, to amend this forecast by the addition of at least  2,000,000.
