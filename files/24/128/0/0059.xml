This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.THE CABINET.NAVAL BASES IN IRELAND.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to the Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP. 3310), I circulate a Memorandum by the General Staff on the Defence of the Naval Bases in Ireland.L.W.-E.The War Oeetce, 13rd October, 1921. /&apos;1. With reference to a Memorandum (OP. 3310) circulated by the First Lord of the Admiralty, the General Staff wish to put forward for consideration certain military aspects of the questions raised therein. It is evident that bases on the Irish coast will be of no use to the Navy in war time unless they are adequately defended against attack, whether from the sea or from the land. Even assuming that the responsibility for - the latter will rest with the local Irish forces, there remains the question of defence against attack from the sea, which is a joint naval, military and air force responsibility, in which the fixed defences, provided and manned by the Army, play an important part. These defences will be required on the first day of mobilization, or even during the precautionary period, and must, therefore, be armed and manned in peace time&apos;. In the past, the invariable policy, in the case of Dominions, has been that the Imperial authorities should lay down the scale of attack, and consequently the scale of defence required to meet it, and they have continued to furnish the means of defence until it was clear that the Dominion itself was in a position to do so. For instance, an Imperial garrison remained in Canadian bases for many years after the creation of the Dominion of Canada, whilst although South Africa was given Dominion status in 1909, responsibility for the defence, of certain Cape ports is only now being handed over to the Union Government. Moreover, this is being done on the understanding that the latter agree to accept the advice of the Committee of Imperial Defence as to the scale of defences required, and will ask the War Office to provide such technical personnel as they themselves are unable to furnish.2. The General Staff are. therefore, of opinion that, to carry out the essential naval conditions laid down by the Prime Minister in his letter of 20th July, the following are necessary from a military point of view in the case of Ireland : (a.) That the scale of attack and defence should continue to be laid down by the Committee of Imperial Defence, and that its ruling should be accepted by Ireland.(&amp;.) That land forces exist which can be relied upen to secure naval bases against attack from the land, (c.) That the Imperial authorities should continue to provide the garrison requiredto man the seaward defences until such time as it is quite clear that Irelandherself can provide the highly skilled personnel required for the purpose.It may be added that, in present circumstances, the numbers involved willprobably be comparatively small.SECRET.C P. 3360.(B21/322)   100   10/21   h&amp;s, Ltd.   9484wo
