[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1921.SECRET.CP. 3328.GREECE AND TURKEY.THE serious reverse which the Greeks have sustained in their attempt to take Angora should add another to the long series of opportunities which have occurred for making a good settlement in the East. It will indeed be disgraceful if we do not make a real effort now to secure such a settlement. The waste and ruin by which the whole of this part of the East is ravaged and its reaction upon the general impoverishment of the world is in itself a sufficient reason. But we have also a much more particular one. As the Greek Army retires they will no doubt destroy the railway behind them, and if they are able to continue in the possession of the junctions which they took in the earlier battles the Turks should find it very difficult to come forward and menace them with active operations. The war is therefore likely to come into a condition of stalemate so far as the Mediterranean side is concerned. Mustapha Kemal, if he is wdse, will not attempt to attack the Greeks once their retreat is complete, but will rather be content with forcing them to keep a very considerable army indefinitely in the field. This is bound to produce in the long run most disastrous reactions in Greece. But what will happen to us during this indefinite and possibly lengthy interval ? Mustapha Kemal, unable to develop any strong offensive towards the West, will have only one outlet for any forces at his disposal, namely, Mosul. Here, for the very smallest expense of troops and ammunition, he can cause us enormous embarrassment. We are steadily and swiftly withdrawing our troops from Mesopotamia, and only in this way can the abatement of the cost be obtained. The arrangements which are contemplated after the troops are gone make no provision at all for the defence of the country against external attack, but are only devised to maintain internal order on the basis of a political system agreeable to the great majority of the people. A few thousand Turkish troops sent into the Mosul Vilayet will compel us to choose between stopping the evacuation of the Army or even bringing back new troops and embarking on field operations at the cost of at least 5 or 6 millions on the one hand, or giving up the Mosul Vilayet altogether on the other. The Arab Army and the levies are not yet ready to take any effective part in a defence against external attack. I have never been an enthusiast for Mesopotamia, still less for Mosul; but I should be sorry if jusfc when things are beginning to go well internally in these regions we were forced to throw aside all our work and admit failure. Those who have supported on the one hand the retention of Mosul, and on the other a forward policy on the part of the Greeks, ought really to explain how these policies can be reconciled.Is it not, therefore, the very moment now for decided intervention to secure a settlement, whether for the sake of Greece or for the sake of Turkey ? It may well be that this further spell of bloody and disappointing fighting may have induced the wish for peace on both sides. Mustapha Kemal may no longer be in the unreasonable mood in which the Bekir Sami negotiations were conducted, and the Greeks must be getting nearer and nearer to bankruptcy and revolution. Now is the time to address ourselves to both sides in the mood which we had reached before the Greek resumption of the offensive. No doubt the terms proposed would have to be remodelled. But having decided ourselves what we think is reasonable, we ought to press upon both sides to the utmost limit of our force, not excluding a blockade of the Piraeus if Greece is unreasonable, or direct assistance in money and supplies to her if Turkey is unreasonable. We seem to have done absolutely nothing during the last three months but watch the progress of this disastrous conflict, and if we continue in this attitude we shall certainly find ourselves formidably disturbed in Mesopotamia..I ask that this matter should be considered by the Cabinet at an early date.W. S. C.Colonial Office, September 26, 1921.[6964]
