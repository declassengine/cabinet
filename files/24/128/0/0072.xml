f/P /errifhurvd&apos; - -   - 349 (THIS POOUMEMP IS peb PROPERTY OF HIS BREEANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S QOVKRMM!) .CABINET.VlQzl Conventions and Recommendations of the Genoa International Labour Conference.1920.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour. SEC ESS. 1. Before the Prorogation, I circulated with CP,C-n    f 1 n 17.32S9, a draft Parliamentary Question and Answer dealing with the action of the Government in respect of the Draft Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference, held at Genoa 1920. Ehe question was not asked, however, and in view of the fact that there is to be au Autumn Session, I suggest that the question should not now be put. but that in accordance with the course adopted for the Washington Conventions etc. in the Debate of 1st July last, a resolution approving the course the Government propose to adopt with regard to the Genoa Conventions and Recommendations be set down for discussion in the Commons, during the short meeting of the House in October.2.        The Genoa Conference closed on 10th July, 1920, Under the terms of Article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles., each Member of the Organisation is under an obligation to bring thu draft Conventions and Recommendations before the competent authority within one year, or, in exceptional circumstances, 18 months, of the closing of the Conference.        It will be seen, therefore, that tho normal poriod of one J^e&amp;r expired on 10th July and that- 1 -
the extended -period will expire on 10th January next; therefore, if we wait till the new session next Spring we shall be out of time.3.      It is necessary that a motion as follows should he put down for the coming Session in accordance with precedent established in the Washington Convention Debate on July 1st:-&quot;That this House approves the policy of Eis Majesty&apos;s Government respecting the Draft Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International labour Conference, held at Genoa in June and July,1920&quot;. 4.        I have set out in an appendix, for the consideration of my colleagues, a statement of the position with regard to each of these. Conventions and Recommendations, and the con-elusions reaohed as a result of inter-clepertmental consultations.   Where necessary, I have indioated.the nature of the statement which I.would propose to make when the motion Is debated.?Sgd.) 3\J, MACUAMARA,October 6th.1921.
APPENDIX *1. The Genoa Conference adopted three draft Conventions and four Recommendations as follows:-Draft Conventions.1,   Draft Convention fixing the minimum age for admission of children to employment at Sea,2.   Draft Convention concerning Unemployment Indemnity in case of loss or foundering of the ship.3.   Draft Convention for establishing facilities for finding employment for seamen.Reo ommendati ons.1.   Recommednation   concerning the limitation of hours of work in the Fishing Industry.2.   Recommendation concerning the limitation of hours of work in Inland Navigation.3.   Recommendation concerning the establishment of Rational Seamen&apos;s Codes.4.   Recommendation concerning Unemployment Insurance for Seamen.These draft Conventions and Recommendations have been published as a Command Paper (Omd. 1174/1921).2.        The first proposal is covered by the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Act, 1920.    The draft Convention was ratified by Order of Council on 5th July, 1921, and came into operation on registration by the Secretary-General of the league of Hations on 14th July, 1921.S.        With regard to the seoond draft Convention, concerning Unemployment Indemnity in case of loss or foundering of the ship, the present position is that Section 158 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, provides that &quot;where the service of a seaman terminates before the date contemplated In the agreement by reason of the
&quot;...352wreck or lose of the ship ..... he shall be entitled towages up to the time of suoh termination but not for any longer period.&quot;    It will, therefore, be neoessary to amend this Section before the draft Convention oan be ratified.If and whan the Board of Trade introduce, a Merchant Shipping Bill, they propose to inolude a clause for this purpose, putting the draft Convention in a schedule and mentioning it in the preamble.I would propose therefore to state that the Government are prepared to accept the Convention but prefer to postpone ratification until the existing legislation is amended in the manner indicated.4.      The Ihird Draft Convention deals with the establish-raent of facilities for finding employment for seamen.   Effect oan be given to this draft Convention without the intro-duction of fresh legislation.      Certain administrative changes may, however, have to be made, in consultation with the seamen and ship-owners.      Thus Article 4 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a system of free public Employment Offices to be established and maintained either (a) by representative Associations of ship-owners and seamen, or (b) in the absence of such joint action, by the State itself.    The question of the extent to which existing arrangements satisfy this Article is one on which the Board of Trade are consulting the representatives of ship-owners and seamen.I would propose accordingly to say that the British Government accept this draft Convention, but prefer to postpone formal ratification until the necessary adminlstra-tive changes are effected.5.      In addition to these draft Conventions, the Conference adopted four Recommendations, the first of which recommends the limitation of hours of work in the Pishing industry.- 4 - .
There ere difficulties in the way of such limitation,, . such as e.g. the fact that the industry is-organised at present on the basis of a twelve hour day and the proposed ohfii-re to t-.n eight hour day would mean an increase of staff, f.Ox- v-fcich no accommodation is available.      Bven if the necessary changes were made it is considered that the fishing vessels would have to be run at a loss.        It is pointed out, moreover, that the hours of work are necessarily governed by weather conditions and the fact that fish is a perishable commodity,I would propose, therefore, to inform the House that the Government do not propose to accept this Recommendation. 6. The second Recommendation concerns the limitation of hours of work in Inland navigation.     In vie% of the conditions in this particular industry at present, I would propose to inform the House that the Government are not in a position at present to announce their final decision regarding this Recommendation, but would propose to postpone consideration of it until the return of more normal conditions. 7. The third Recommendation deals with the establishmentof lation^l Seamen&apos;s Codes.      Sffect could be given to this Recommendation by the passing of legislation consolidating the Ilerchant Shipping Acts.     In the view, however, of the Board of Trade, while such consolidation is in itself desirable, it is not by any means necessary and would not, under ordinary circumstances, be undertaken yet.     In view of the great-pressure of urgent parliamentary work, the Board of Trade prefer to postpone the question of such.consolidation at thepresent time.I would propose accordingly to state that theGovernment are prepared to accept this Recommendation but propoeto defer the necessary,legislative action until the pressure ofoth er w ork le s s ens.*- 5 -
8.      The fourth Recommendation o one erne establishment of schemes of Unemployment Insurance for Seamen.   effect  is already given to this Recommendation under the Unemployment Insurance Acts 1911-1921.
