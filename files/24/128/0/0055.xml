Hankey:-You have doubtless in mind, if Ireland gets anything whioh puts her on a level with Dominions, she will claim to join League of Nations as an independent member.     Existing status of India and proposed position of Albania must be also remembered in. this connection.     I do not know that ireland s membership of League of Nations would be necessarily a very serious calamity but if she was out to wreck machine she would not find it very difficult;    and to me personally it would not be pleasant to reflect that South Ireland had privileges denied to North.Whitehall Gardens, SvW. stober 3rd. 1921.
