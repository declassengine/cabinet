[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government!260Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1921.SECRET. 3CP.-3349.CABINET,WEEKLY SURVEY OE THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 26th instant.General State of the Country. Observance of Truce. -Outside the Ulster Six Counties Area the country continues to enjoy conditions not very different from those of normal times, except that the Sinn Feiner is triumphant in local government and in local life. There are noticeable increased signs of strain due to the protracted negotiations which have kept the more active spirits fn the rank and file too long in a state of enforced inactivity combined with uncertainty afe to the future. The announcement that the Government and. the Sinn Fein leaders have composed their preliminary differences and have fixed a date for the holding of a Conference would no doubt have the effect of relieving this tension, but in view of possible further delays in the next stage of the negotiations, it may probably be desirable to set up some more efficient machinery than at present exists for dealing with breaches of the truce, which, although comparatively unim-poftant in themselves, may at any time be followed by grave unforeseen consequences. This matter is already under consideration and will be proceeded with if a Confer-ence is definitely agreed upon.In reference to the truce, one very ugly incident occurred which might easily&apos; have led to deplorable results. Two private soldiers of the 1st Gloucester Regiment, who were cycling unarmed, though in uniform, through Gortnascragga, Newmarket District, Co. Cork, came upon the outskirts of an I.R.A. encampment, and on refus-ing to halt were fired upon by the sentries. Fortunately both escaped injury it is possible that the firing was purposely wide and intended merely as a warning but it would not require many incidents of this character to produce a dangerous effect on the minds of members of the Crown Forces which would render the continuance of the truce almost an impossibility. The Police reports point to an increase of drilling, by the I.R.A. in all parts of the country. An undoubted breach of the truce was committed by a party of the I.R.A., about fifty strong, who forcibly took possession on the 20th instant of Harristown House, Co. Kildare, an untenanted mansion belonging to the estate of the late Mr. Percy La Touche, and proceeded to use.it as a barrack and training ground. I am glad to state, however, that the place was&apos; evacuated on the 26th instant as a result of representations made to the Sinn Fein Liaison Officer, and that no damage of any kind was committed to the property during the time of its occupation.Renewed Outbreak of Rioting in Belfast.Another fierce outbreak of party rioting occurred in Belfast on the 24th instant. Sniping commenced at 7 a.m. and continued throughout the day. One man (a Roman Catholic) was killed and a man and a woman (both Roman Catholics) were wounded by revolver or rifle fire. The disturbances were renewed on the evening of the following day and continued throughout the 26th instant. The origin of the outbreak has not yet been ascertained, but from the following summary of the events of the 25th and 26th instant, issued as a communique by the Military Authorities in Belfast, it would appear that the Orange element of the population must bear a large share of the responsibility for the bloodshed.[6996] B
Military communique of the 25th September, 1921: -&quot; Rifle and revolver shooting broke out in Little George&apos;s Street just before 4-50 p.m., and was quietened by the military and police. No casualties or damage done. At 6-15 p.m. sniping began from the railway embankment in the Ballyrnacarret area.&quot;At 6-35 p.m. a crowd gathered in Wolff Street (Protestant area) and threw a bomb into a spirit grocery at the corner of Seaforde Street (Roman Catholic area), which is believed to have set fire to it.&quot;At any rate the grocery was destroyed by fire. The Roman Catholics retaliated by throwing a bomb from Seaforde Street into the crowd in Wolff Street watching the burning grocery, and caused twenty casualties (all Protes-tahts). Sniping went on all over the area until 9-30 p.m. All is quiet there since then.&quot; A Roman Catholic woman in her house was killed by a shot. It is not known from whence the shot came.&quot; At 8-45 p.m. a bomb was thrown in Mile water Street (York Road area) by Protestants&apos;, causing eight Roman Catholic casualties, none of whom was killed.  Sniping also took place in the area.&quot;Military communique of the 26th September, 1921: &quot;At 6-15 a.m. shots were fired from the burnt-out public-house at the corner of Seaforde Street into Seaforde Street (Roman Catholic locality). At 6-30 a.m. shots were fired in Clonallen and Sheriff Streets.&quot; At 8 a.m. Roman Catholic dock labourers were forced to leave their work on Queen&apos;s Quay owing to alleged intimidation. At 11 a.m. a mob proceeded to Ardenlee Avenue, Ravenhill Road, and attacked Roman Catholic workers employed on a football ground. One Roman Catholic was shot in the leg and two others were injured by missiles. *&quot; About 3 p.m. Roman Catholic workmen at McGladdery&apos;s brickworks in Springfield Road were forced to leave work by a mob. At about the same time a Protestant was assaulted and beaten in Butler Street (Roman Catholic area).&quot; At 8-42 p.m. three men entered the public-house of a Roman Catholic on the Antrim road and posted up an anti-boycott notice. When leaving one of the men fired a shot at the publican, striking him in the throat.&quot;At 9-30 p.m. shots were fired from Nelson Street into Garmoyle Street, and a Roman Catholic lad, aged 17, was wounded. At 10-15 p.m. shots were fired by both factions in the Little George&apos;s Street area. There were no casualties.&quot; Some assaults of a party nature took place during the day, and attacks were made on Roman Catholics, spirit groceries and publicans in the New-townards Road area.&quot;The. total casualties for the week-end were five killed and seventy-one wounded, bringing the total known casualties in the series of riots that have occurred in Belfast since the 1st July, 1920, to 128 killed and 970 wounded.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Three trials of civilians by court-martial were concluded during the week-In one case a fine of  5, or in default two months&apos; imprisonment, was imposed for the possession of arms and ammunition. The second case was that of a wireless operator, who was sentenced to a fine of  15, or in default four months&apos; imprison-ment, for the offence of purchasing an automatic pistol from a soldier; and the third that of a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who was convicted of theft and sentenced to one year&apos;s imprisonment with hard labour.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 24th instant: Total orders madeOrders cancelled for reasons other than release Releases ordered ...225 4534,353678Number of persons now interned The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 31.3,675

On the 25th instant a provisional settlement between the Midland Great Western Railway Company and the Dublin and South-Eastern Railway Company and their &quot;shopmen&quot; employees was come to at a conference -held in the Ministry of Labour, the agreement providing for immediate resumption of work without prejudice, and the arbitration within ten days of the question of the reasonableness of the 6s. per week reduction, the arbitrator being given power to determine : (a) the amount of the reduction, if any; (b) the date when the reduction, if any; comes into operation; and (c) the right to district rates of pay. The Arbitration Tribunal, which will be presided over by Lord Justice O&apos;Connor, has also been given the right to postpone its decision for a reasonable period at its discretion. The Great Southern and Western Railway Company was not represented at the conference, but has since expressed their willingness to accept the arbitration of Mr. Corrigan, K.C., the arbitrator appointed by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland under the recent agreement between the Irish[6996] - B 2
Railway Companies and the Railway Unions representing the majority of the railway workers. In view of the fact that the &quot;shopmen&quot; constitute a comparatively small minority of the railway workers, the appointment of a second arbitrator to deal with the question substantially similar to that affecting the general body of the workers is regarded by this company as unsatisfactory. To meet the objections raised by members of the locomotive staff upon whom the notices terminating their employment were served the company have offered to withdraw these notices and to substitute notices of suspension only, in accordance with the practice obtaining in Great Britain for men of this grade. This concession, however, has been rejected by the men affected, who demand an unconditional withdrawal of the notices, and at a meeting of the company&apos;s locomotive staff, held on the 26th instant, it was decided to cease all work that night, when the original notices expired. This decision was acted upon this morning, with the result that all passenger traffic from Kingsbridge Station to the south and west is for. the moment suspended.Present Political Situation in Ireland.Pending the Prime Ministers reply to Mr. de Valera&apos;s letter of the 19th instant, there has been no development of the Irish political situation. Public opinion remains optimistic as to the prospect of an early conference, and the statements made by Mr. Arthur Griffith in a recent interview given to a representative of the Daily Mail have done much to encourage the hope that the Sinn Fein leaders are prepared to enter a conference in a more reasonable and practical frame of mind than they have hitherto displayed. Special significance is attached to Mr. Griffiths statement that &quot; the only thing that matters or is binding on the parties that confer is their final agreement.   Interim attitudes are wiped out by that agreement.&quot;H. G.Irish Office, S.W., September 29, 1921.
