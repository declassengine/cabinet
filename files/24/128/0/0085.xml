The Assembly has not sufficient information as to the influences by which the Soviet Government are moved or the conditions under which thoy are working, hut it considers that Dr. Nansen1s successful repatriation of prisoners of war augurs well for any enterprise he may be prepared to undertake for the relief of famine-stricken regions in Armenia, Azerbaidjan, Georgia and Russia.(THIS D0CUM3NT IS THS PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.)
&quot;4. In view of the statements made by members of the Committee on behalf *f their Governments to the effect that these Governments do not think that under present circumstances they can grant official credits, the Assembly is of opinion that this fact settles for the time being this side of the matter, and disengages the possible responsibility of the League of nations.&quot;nevertheless, the League does not disinterest itself in so grave a problem and in the efforts which are being made to solve it.     It will rest with the Council of the League to take up the question, should circumstances so demand* and should it consider that its intervention could prove both useful and effective.The Assembly notes that an International Conference has been summoned to meet at Brussels on October 6th in order to consider the ^problem of the famine raging in Russia and the means of remedying it by the concerted action of Governments and private associations.&quot;The Assembly expresses the hope that the authorised representatives of the Governments may consider tho most expedient means of coping with the financial difficulties of this problem.   Amongst the forms of relief -which the Governments, might afford, the Assembly would urge the importance of gifts in kind from the liquidation of war stocks.n6. The Assembly considers that the Committee of the League of Nations formed to combat epidemics should be invited to co-operate with the associations which have undertaken the campaign against infectious diseases in Russia and the Caucasus.&quot;7. The President of the Assembly is requested to transmit to His Holiness Pope Benedict XV a copy of resolutions mentioned above in the hope that he may find therein a proof of the profound appreciation with which the League of Nations received the message in which His Holiness begged to draw the attention of the representa-tives of the Governments assembled in Geneva to the unhappy plight of the famine-stricken areas in Russia and the urgency of alleviating and rendering them assistance.&quot;The Assembly takes this opportunity of expressing to His Holiness its warmest gratitude for so generous an action, which manifests once again the anxiety with which His Holiness ever proceeds in the alleviation of all suffering.w
LgAGUg 0? NATIONS.RiSLiaB1 VfOm IN RUSSIA. REPORT PRESl&amp;TTSD TO TH3 ASSBH3LY BY THE SIXTH COIMlTgiilE tRapporteur:   ii. MbTTA.On Septerfber 14-th the Assembly forwarded to the Sixth Committee for consideration &quot;and report the following motion proposed &quot;by Dr. Han sen, Delegate of Norway, on September 9thj 1921 ..-&quot;That the Assembly refer to a Committee the question of the present famine in Russia.&quot;That the Committee consider whether it is advisable for the Assembly:*&quot;1; To make a pressing appeal to the Governments to -provide the necessary credits, and -&quot;2. To invite-the Council to offer the services of the Organisation*for International Credits . to act. as trustee for the financial control of any credits mada available and for the supervision of any security provided by the Russian Government against such credits.&quot;The Sixth C^ammittee&apos; at its meeting on September 28th adopted the following report, which it now submits to the &apos; Assembly1.   The gravity of tho famine is undoubted;   the problem which Dr. Nansen has laid before the Assembly is therefore of the very greatest importance, not only from a humanitarian, but also from an economic point of view.2, It is also an undoubted fact that- speedy action is required in order to assist the millions of human beings who are dying of hunger.3*   Although the Committee has not bean called upon to formulate a technical opinion on the programme drawn up by Dr. Nansen, it nevertheless wishes to express its confidence in the energy and devotion which Dr. Nansen has so often displayed.     The Committee considers Dr. Nansen* s previous successes especially for the repatriation of prisoners of war as serious reasons for thinking that the agreements which he has made will enable him to achieve the humanitarian end which he has in view.4.    It would seem both equitable and desirable that the Assembly of the league of Nations, should address an urgent appeel to tho charitable organisations of the whole world in order that they should make- a joint effort in bringing assistance to the unhappy, population which is dying of hunger. *Among these organisations the Red Cross Societies appear, from their nature and the- objects they aim at, as being particularly qualified for playing an important part in this work.This Organisation has boon established by the Council of the League in connection with the Ter Moulen Scheme.- j -
5&quot;.   The effort of tho charitable organisations should not bo confined only to Russia, but should extend also to Aaexhoi&amp;jan, Georgia and Armenia and to the Caucasian districts &quot;in general, as they, are suffering from a crisis no less terrible and thoir misfortunes have undoubtedly been aggravated by the prolongod occupation of the Bolshevik armies.&apos;6.   Several .statements made loy 1&apos;cmbers of the Committee on behalf of their Governments arc to the effect that these Governments did not think that under the present circumstances they could grant official credits.     This fact settles for tho time being this.side of tho matter, and disengages the possible responsibility of the league of Natibns.Nevertheless, the League does not disinterest itself in so grave a problem and in the efforts which are being made to solve it.     It will rest with the Council of the League to take up the question should circumstances so demand, and should it consider that its intervention Could prove both useful and. effective.7.   On tho other hand, the Committee thinks that it should adopt Dr. Hanson&apos;.s suggestion to tho effect   that the Governments should be ask3d to give up for the work of assisting Russia such military stocks (food, clothing, etc) as nay be at their disposal. , ,.   ,. 8.   The Committee recommends that the Epidemics Committee of the League of Nations should co-operate&apos;with the organisations which are combating typhus and cholera in Russia. &apos;9*   finally j tho Committee&apos; is of opinion that tile Assembly should take note of the summoning of the above^ mentioned Conference at Brussels, while, at the same time, refraining from- expressing a decisive opinion with regard to this Conference.&apos; The Sixth -Committee adopted at the same time the following resolutions, completing the above report, which it now likewise submits to the Assembly:-&quot;After having heard the Report of its Committee and the statement by Dri Nansen * to whose activity and devotion-it is happy to. pay tribute - and after having taken note of the generous appeal of His Holiness Pope Benedict XV, on behalf-of the famine-stricken regions of Russia, the.-assembly of the League of Nations adopted the following Resolutions&quot;1. The Assembly considers it an urgent necessity to combat the famine in Russia;,   it further considers that all efforts should be encouraged which, like the Geneva Conference, airn at alleviating this scourge.&quot;The Assembly addresses a pressing appeal to private organisations in order that the efficacy of the common endeavour may be assured by a close co-ordonation of all the efforts devoted to this cause. &apos;- .&apos;:.-&apos;&quot;/The Assembly further expresses a desire that the Governments of all.-..countries may interest themselves in the efforts of their national associations and should grant them, to the greatest possible extent, such material and moral support as they nay need.
&quot;2:. Tho Assembly.considers that relief work should he extended to include all the regions of former Russia which are visited;by,famine without,forgetting the populations of tho territories of the Republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azorbaxdjaniri . ,The Asscnbiy;aotos that an International Conference has boon summoned to meet at Brussels oil October 6th in order to consider the problem of the famine raging in Russia and the means of remedying it by the concerted action of!Governments and private associations.The Assembly expresses the hope that the authorised representatives of the Governments may consider the most expedient means of coping with the financial difficulties of this problem.     Amongst the forms of relief which the Govern-ments might afford, the Assembly would urge the importance of gifts in kind from the liquidation of war stocks.&quot;4. The Assembly considers that the Comnittee of the League of Nations formed to combat epidemics should be invited to co-operator with the associations which have undertaken, the campaign against infectious diseases in Russia and the Caucasus.&quot; %   The President of the Assembly is requested to transmit to His Holiness the Pope Benedict XV a copy of the four resolutions above mentioned in the hope that he may find therein a proof of the profound appreciation with/which the league of Nations received the message in which His Holiness had begged to draw tho attention of the Representatives of the Governments assembled in Genova to the unhappy plight of the famine-stricken areas in Russia and the urgency of alleviating and rendering them assistance.&quot;The Assembly takes this opportunity of expressing to His Holiness its warmest gratituue for so generous an action, which manifests once again the anxiety with which His Holiness ever proceeds in the alleviation of all suffering.&quot;2 Whitehall Gardens,October 10th, 1921.
