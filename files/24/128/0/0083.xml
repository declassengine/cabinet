[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]EASTERN (Turkey)[October 7.]confidential.Section 1.E 11096/143/44]No. 1.Intervention between Greece and Turkey.ANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.^sssssssi^RvO of my colleagues have written notes urging an immediate or early See.   intervention  in the  struggle, which  appears to have  reached a position of . stalemate between the Greeks and the Turks.   They maybe sure that the idea 33 * of such intervention at the first moment consistent with a reasonable chance of tya   success has never been absent from my mind since the rejection by the Greeks of the last offer made by the Allies after my visit to Paris in June.    But the problem is not to be solved by the &quot;mere expression of an a priori desire; and I will here endeavour to state, for the assistance of the Cabinet in arriving at a decision, the main conditions of the problem, as it now presents itself.   The story will necessarily be rather a long one.The first point to be determined is the military situation. Since the Greeks early in September failed to break through to Angora and retired west of the Sakharia, the Greek objective has apparently been to occupy a line about 20 miles east of Eskishehr, extending in front of Afion Karahissar, and some 16 miles south-eastwards along the Anatolian Railway, and to hold on to this territory as territory conquered in war, organising its administration on the lines of the zone round Smyrna. It is difficult, however, from the information reaching us, and while the situation changes from day to day, to form a clear opinion of the state of either belligerent &apos;s army.As regards the Greeks, Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 18th September that, although the Greeks had fought remarkably well, the moral of their staff appeared to be shaken and the Turks seemed to be working round both flanks. It remained to be . seen whether retirement could be carried out in good order. General Harington also telegraphed on the 2&apos;2nd September that he had received General Papoulas&apos;s appreciation of the situation, &quot; which was that of a beaten man seeing the enemy threatening him everywhere.&quot; He added that the Greeks might succeed in stopping on the Eskishehr line if the weather broke there as it had at Constantinople. Again Lord Granville telegraphed on the 26th September that his Italian colleague had good information that the Turks had completely cut the communications between Afion Karahissar and Ushak; that they were encircling the right wing of the Greek army, whose moral was low but discipline not lost. On the 23rd September Lord Granville telegraphed that the Greek Minister of Finance had informed his French colleague that the Greeks wouid defend Eskishehr, but if the Turks succeeded in driving them thence, the Greeks might consider themselves defeated and the campaign might be abandoned.On the other hand, Major Johnston, General Harington&apos;s liaison officer with the Greeks, reported on the 20th September that the Greeks were &quot; destroying the railway west of the Sakharia by blowing up each rail,&quot; and were laying waste the country. The Greeks, although their losses were said to have been 23,000 against Turkish 17,000, &quot;were not in danger, and the retreat will be carried out safely.&quot; General Harington also telegraphed on the 23rd September that &quot; the Greek army appears to be holding its own and retiring in good order on positions previously decided upon, despite the fact that the Turks are showing great energy and ability in carrying out cavalry raids.&quot;As regards the Turks our information is more meagre. Secret messages indicated, however, that, just before the Greek retreat, the Turks were very short of ammunition and guns and equally short of motor lorries and petrol. We know, however, that they are receiving ammunition in coasting boats from Batum, and General Harington admits a leakage from Constantinople, apparently from stores under French control, which the Greek warships can only partially stop in the Black Sea.   General Papoulas even admitted to General Harington that the[70409-1]B
Turkish troops opposed to him were stronger and better equipped than his own troops. It is also clear from secret sources that the French are negotiating for the direct supply of ammunition to the Kemalists, although actual delivery seems to depend on the outcome of the Franklin-Bouillon negotiations at Angora. -Meanwhile both parties are officially celebrating the tremendous victory that they have won. Te Deums have been sung at Athens, and public rejoicings have taken place at Angora. &quot;We are reminded of the Battle of Jutland, which we simul-taneously celebrated as a triumph in London and Berlin.On the whole, however, it seems unlikely that the Kemalists can for some time sufficiently rernunition themselves or become&quot; sufficiently mobile, with winter and the rainy weather setting in, to drive the Greeks from the two junctions of Eskishehr and Afion Karahissar. Though their lines of communication are long the Greeks have all the railways, other than the short stretch of the Anatolian and Baghdad beyond Tchai to Cilicia, and, if they can enforce it against the French and Italians, the command of the sea communications, other than those between Trebizond and Batuim A stalemate with both sides exhausted has been General Harington&apos;s forecast up to now, and this seems probable but not certain. On the other hand time seems to be on the side of the Turks since if the Greek troops cannot be demobilised, their moral is likely to suffer during the winter months in the trenches, subject to continuous raids and in the middle of a hostile country. If the situation changes at all it seems likely to be against the Greeks. From the military point of view the moment for intervention by the Allies would appear therefore to be propitious.I now turn to the political attitude of the Greeks.After the meeting of the Supreme Council in Paris in August and before the Greek retreat, Lord Granville sounded the Greek Prime Minister regarding his peace aims. They appeared to be a &quot; strategic&apos;.&apos; frontier for the Smyrna zone, apparently pushed north to the Sea of Marmara to include Brusa, and some form of autonomous international State for the Straits and Constantinople, in the administration of which Greece would participate with the principal Allies. About&apos; the same time there were indications that the Greek Government believed that His Majesty&apos;s Government would support a Greek entry into Constantinople. The idea seems to have been reluctantly dropped after strong representations by Lord Granville and a Beuter statement, and in an interview at Brusa just before the Greek retirement King Constantine was reported to have admitted that he realised that the Allies would not allow the Greeks to go to Constantinople, at any rate &quot;for the present.&quot; Since the Greek retirement there has been no clear indication from Athens whether mediation would be acceptable or what terms Greece would now accept. On the one hand Lord Granville reported on the 19th September that all the papers seemed to agree that the time had come when the Government must at last make a great diplomatic effort in order to secure the acquiescence of Powers in suitable terms of peace, and that the general tone of the i press indicated that mediation would be welcome. On the other hand he-telegraphed on the 21st September that M. Gounaris, &quot;who was not at all cheerful,&quot; had said &quot; no &quot; to an enquiry whether the Greeks meant to take the first step towards negotiation with Kemal. They would hold the line decided upon and see what happened. &quot;Gounaris made no allusion to mediation.&quot; In a more recent statement to the press (26th September), M. Gounaris announced- that &quot;the Greeks must organise the occupied territory so as to defend it with the least possible sacrifices and expense, and we shall proceed to that organisation making it as complete as possible.&quot;In August, before Parliament rose, M. Gounaris suggested a visit to London to see the Prime Minister and myself. The moment was, for many reasons, inopportune, and the reply was sent that the middle of October would be a better season. M. Gounaris has now revived the proposal, but has not yet been given a definite date. Until he comes he is not very likely to indicate with any precision how the Greeks view the situation or what terms they will accept. Meanwhile his own position seems to be somewhat insecure. Rival politicians are believed to have obtained the ear of the King, and, although M. Gounaris may survive the expected crisis, his Ministry does not seem likely to be long-lived.Such information as we have regarding the internal situation in Greece (necessity of floating an internal loan, drachma at 78, calling up of the 1922 class, an admitted shortage of reserves) points to the Greeks (even if they believe that they can hold the Eskishehr line, which is uncertain) being ready to accept Allied mediation if the Allies are at all insistent and if sufficiently &quot;face-saving&quot; terms
can be offered. Indeed, we hear of a spirit of depression prevailing at Athens when the real nature of the retirement came to be understood. This feeling will grow as winter draws on.The attitude of the Constantinople Government is a less important factor, but it is perhaps significant that on the 23rd September Sir H. Rumbold reported that Tewfik Pasha, the Grand Vizier, had at a recent Cabinet reviewed the situation in Asia Minor as a stalemate, and stated that he had advocated in i&apos;ecent conversa-tions with diplomatists at Constantinople the retention of Thrace by Greece, together with certain concessions in Smyrna, conditional on the immediate evacuation of Anatolia. He added that the time had come to approach the Allies officially. The more Nationalist members of the Cabinet had protested on the ground that Angora must make the first move. Tewfik&apos;s move was believed to be -inspired by the Sultan, and possibly to herald changes in the Cabinet in a direction unfavourable to the Kemalists. This, however, has not followed. Meanwhile we know the Constantinople Government to be in close touch with Angora through the Constantinople Minister for Foreign Affairs, Izzet Pasha.As regards the situation at Angora, our reports do not encourage any very sanguine hopes as to Angora&apos;s readiness for peace. One thing seems clear, however, namely, that, in spite of some hostile symptoms, the nationalist move-ment, Avith Mustapha Kemal either as dictator or figurehead, has a real hold in Asia Minor. It also seems probable that there is really not much difference of opinion in principle between the various parties at Angora, beyond personal jealousies, and that the pre-war C.U.P. elements have created a fairly strong centralised and comparatively efficient Government, of a military kind. These points were emphasised at the Foreign Office the other day by Dr. White, an American missionary of long experience, who has seen much of Kemalist Turkey and only recently left it.On the other hand, the material resources of the Kemalists cannot be strong. The shortage of ammunition, motors and petrol has already been noted. The recent forcible requisition of 40 per cent, of all stocks in Asia Minor was also significant. If intelligence reports may be trusted, a recent decision first to ask the Bolsheviks for labour and later for cavalry, and the removal of all troops from the Caucasus and Cilicia fronts show exhausted man-poWer. The same reports, confirmed by Dr. White, go to show that although the Kussians have undoubtedly helped with arms and ammunition and offered but not delivered warships, the Kemalists regard Bolshevik agents and Bolshevik designs with no small suspicion, while the Bolsheviks&apos;hardly conceal their intention of recovering Kars and Sarykamish at the earliest opportunity. The &quot; manage de convenance &quot; with the Bolsheviks, in short, seems unlikely to weigh strongly with the Kemalists at&apos;the moment if they thought that they could obtain acceptable terms from the Allies. Unfortunately it is very hard even to guess what their terms would be to-day., Before the Greek offensive of last July there was very little indication that the Kemalists would modify appreciably in negotiations the &quot;terms of the National Pact of February 1921, which, as it is so often referred to, I am printing at &apos;the close of this Memorandum. These terms, though admittedly susceptible of modification in detail in the course of negotiation, differ very materially from the Treaty of Sevres even as afterwards proposed to be modified in London and Paris.On the other hand, the indication of Kemalist terms communicated to us at the end of July by Mr. Toynbee, the correspondent of the &quot; Manchester. Guardian,&quot; who has transferred his sympathies from the Greeks to the Turks, showed a certain willingness to interpret the Pact more reasonably, especially in the matter of the Capitulations and finance, and possibly in the case of the Straits. That was, however, before the Greek retreat, and there was no sign of any abandonment of the Pacfs territorial provisions retention of Smyrna and Thrace.Since the Greek retreat, however, there has been some indication that Angora might be willing to accept intervention, though probably on her own terms. First, a telegram from Angora to Constantinople of the 12th September showed an inclination to turn negotiations about prisoners into negotiations for peace, and the Japanese High Commissioner, who had offered to intervene, was informed that the object of the National Assembly was to secure a peace guaranteeing the liberty and independence of the Turkish nation within its frontiers, and if the British Government would admit and concede these legitimate aims, they would be ready to start negotiations at once.On the other hand, there can be little doubt &quot;what the legitimate frontiers of Turkey, as interpreted by the Kemalists, are.   On the 21st September Sir H.
Rum bold reported that the Kemalist Minister for Foreign Affairs, Youssouf Kemal, in a long and not unreasonable reply to the High Commissioners protest as to Greek and Armenian deportations in Asia Minor, had concluded that the Near East could only be pacified if Smyrna were restored to Turkey. No palliatives would be of any avail. A complete end must be put to the invasion of Asia Minor by the Greeks, and, he added, in Sir H. Rumbold&apos;s words &quot; almost as an after-thought,&quot; a similar course must be adopted in respect of the Greek occupation of Thrace.Thirdly, in a very recent speech reported by the &quot; Morning Post &quot; Constanti-nople correspondent on the 26th September, Mustapha Kemal said &quot;... we want peace and we are ready to make peace. My own opinion is that there is not any - obstacle to such aim.&quot; All he demanded was recognition of their existence and national independence. &quot; Mr. Lloyd George on the 16th August in the British House of Commons indicated intervention in favour of the winner of the war, and I am hopeful that Mr. Lloyd George will not go back on his word.&quot;These are of course only vague indications of a readiness to treat, but they are perhaps significant coming after the Greek retirement. They seem to justify the general appreciation of the situation given in Sir H. Rumbold&apos;s despatch of the 20th September. &quot; I find that my colleagues share my impression that the Nationalists would be glad to make peace as they realise their exhausted state. I personally do not believe, however, that they would be satisfied with less than the solution contemplated at Paris in June last with regard to Smyrna &quot; (i.e., an autonomous province under Turkish sovereignty, a mixed gendarmerie under a proportion of Allied officers and gradual retirement of Greek troops). &quot;Looking at the situation from here it would seem that we must await further development of military situation and see whether the Greeks will be able to carry out their programme of destroying the railway between Eskishehr and Angora, and creating a desert without hindrance from the Nationalists. A few weeks should be sufficient to judge of the effect on the internal situation in Greece of the serious check they have received. &quot;We therefore think that towards the end of October the Allies may find the moment favourable for action.&quot;In short, the Kemalists would probably not refuse Allied intervention in the shape of an invitation to a conference by the Supreme Council. Whether terms could be agreed upon and offered on a basis acceptable to them is a very different matter, which I will discuss presently.One condition, however, it will not be disputed, is an essential preliminary to any such conference, supposing the two combatants to be willing to attend it.The Allies must agree in advance, preferably with Greece, but certainly among themselves, on the main modifications of the Treaty of Sevres which will be reasonably likely to satisfy the Kemalists.The terms of such a settlement can, for the purposes of convenient consideration, be divided into two main categories : I. Those which mainly concern Greece and Turkey. II. Those which mainly concern the Principal Allies and Turkey.I. The crux is undoubtedly, as it has been all along, the Smyrna zone. At the June Conference in Paris there was agreement among the Principal Allies in proposing an autonomous province under Turkish sovereignty administered by a Christian Governor (incidentally Greece would be more likely to accept and Turkey might,well offer a Turkish subject of Greek race as Governor) with the assistance of a mixed gendarmerie under European officers; Greek troops to be&apos; withdrawn as soon as the gendarmerie could ensure security in the province.It may I think be taken as axiomatic that the Kemalists will never make a peace with Greece on less favourable terms than these, unless the Allies are prepared to unite in support of Greece and in hostility to Turkey (by which I mean the formal supply of arms and financial assistance to Greece and the blockade of the Mediterranean and Black Sea Kemalist ports at the least). But it seems equally axiomatic that France, with King Cqnstantine on the throne of Greece, anxious to recuperate herself economically in Turkey, and probably committing herself to some support of Turkish aspirations in her negotiations in Angora, will not tigree so to support Greece. It is hardly more likely that the Italians will support Greece with regard to Smyrna. It is true that the Italian Government has recently sat rather carefully on the fence as between Greeks and Turks and as between ourselves and the French, but we know from secret sources that they
are now sending Signor Tuozzi to Angora and that they are really as anxious as ever to secure economic concessions from Turkey in southern Asia Minor.In these circumstances it would probably be impossible for Great Britain alone to enable Greece to defeat the Kemalists arid to hold Smyrna in the face of a benevolent French attitude towards the Kemalists, quite apart from the outweighing disadvantages of risking a split in the Entente.If these considerations are sound, it follows that if a profitable mediation is to be offered Great Britain must press upon the Greeks something like the Paris proposals of June with regard to Smyrna. These proposals might conceivably be made more palatable to Greece by abolishing any customs barrier between the Smyrna province and Greece, and possibly by admitting Greece, so far as the Smyrna province is concerned, to the Tripartite Agreement or to the &quot;under-standing between gentlemen&quot; which, it was proposed at Paris in June, should take the place of the Tripartite Agreement., In addition His Majesty&apos;s Government might offer recognition of King Constantine and possibly facilities for raising a loan here, though I doubt very much whether the French Government would join in any such proceeding. It is also a matter for consideration whether the islands in the Sea of Marmara left to Turkey by the Treaty of Sevres but ethnologically Greek might not be given to Greece.   They could not be garrisoned, as they are in the demilitarised area.Lastly, we shall have to insist on the Italians returning the Dodecanese even if it is too much to hope that they will throw in the concession of Rhodes.If, however, the Greeks are to be brought to accept such a solution as the above&apos; of the Smyrna area, it seems politically impracticable to change the settlement of Thrace provided for in the Treaty of, Sevres in the direction apparently desired by both the French and the Italians at the Paris Conference in June (the creation of an international zone under an international gendarmerie). Both on ethnological grounds and more especially in order to secure that the Dardanelles shall remain open, it seems essential that the Dardanelles peninsula and the northern shore of the Marmara, at any rate as far as Rodosto, should remain in Greek hands. This would rule out the return of Northern Thrace to Turkey or acceptance of the Enos-Midia line (which is no natural frontier) as the graeco-Turkish boundary. The Kemalists, and the French supporting them, ask for the return of Thrace or for its internationalisation in order the better to defend Constantinople. There are other ways of meeting this : (a) The Treaty of Sevres frontier can be brought across from its present point south of Midia to a point on the northern shore of the Sea of Marmara nearer Rodosto. (b) Greek troops in Eastern Thrace (as opposed to gendarmerie) might be stationed only in certain places and in fixed numbers. Correspondingly the number of Turkish troops in European Turkey would have to be fixed, (c) There would remain, to safeguard both Turkey and Greece, the existence of an international commission of the Straits and of an Allied force, however small, at the Dardanelles end of the Straits. Greek troops might participate in this garrison on the European shore and Turkish troops in the Allied garrison on the Asiatic shore.In addition, it must be remembered that we have promised our support for the strengthening of article 15 of the Greek Minority Treaty in such a way as to give the Moslem majority of Adrianople the predominant share in the executive functions and in the ministerial council, and some stronger provision regarding non-interference by the Greek Government with the management of Moslem sacred shrines or places of Moslem worship, the immunities of the latter to be guaranteed.II. I pass to the considerations that more directly affect the Allies in relation to Turkey. While we have no clear indication of what precise modifications of the Treaty of Sevres, apart from Thrace and Smyrna, would satisfy the Kemalists, it seems certain that in order to obtain a settlement now, the Allies may have to go further than the concessions offered in London in March last (see Annex I to this memorandum) in the direction of saving the face of the Turks so far as the financial provisions of the treaty are concerned. -At Paris in June M. Briand told me that with regard to finance, in which French interests were paramount, he would be willing to seek a method of securing essential control that would not offend Nationalist susceptibilities. He probably meant abolishing the Financial. Commission and falling back on the pre-war Debt Council. Our objection to this has always been that although the machinery of the Publio Debt is very efficient, and although we and the Italians are represented equally with the French on the Council, the French Government, [7040 0-4]      * C
owing to the preponderant number of French bondholders in the pre-war Debt, would inevitably cause French claims on Turkey to be given precedence over other Allied claims. Under the Treaty of Sevres the policy was to pool Turkish resources (revenues assigned to the Debt and other sources of revenue) for the payment not only of the pre-war Debt, but also of the cost of Allied occupation and the payment of Allied war claims for damages, &amp;c. For us therefore it Would be preferable to maintain the financial provisions of the Treaty of Sevres and in some form or other the substitution of the Financial Commission for the pre-war Debt Council. Having regard, however, to the facts (a) that French financial interests in Turkey are greater than British, while British economic interests in Turkey (share of imports and exports) are greater than French, and (bi that the Kemalists object to a body like the Financial Corn-mission under the Treaty of Sevres, which is responsible to the Allies and has practically executive powers, as an infringement of their independence, a &quot; way out &quot; might be found by going back more or less to the pre-war system of &quot;Allied , advisers to Turkish Ministries. The French might appoint an adviser to the Ministry of Finance who would be a servant of the Turkish Government; we might appoint an adviser to the Ministry of Customs; and the Italians an adviser to the Ministries concerned with concessions. The financial and economic obligations of Turkey under the Treaty of Sevres would remain, and these three advisers might form a council for advising the Turkish Government as to how best to meet their obligations. This plan would, of course, mean that we should recognise and make permanent the French preponderant control of Turkish finance. It would also mean that we should rely on the personality and influence of the Allied representatives to ensure Turkey meeting all her obligations. To safeguard ourselves against French pre-war and war claims against Turkey being met before our own, owing to the preponderant French influence at the Ministry of Finance, we might have to make a separate agreement with the. French Government regarding priority of payments, osc. These are very tentative suggestions, and the Treasury might have objections to offer, but in the case of Turkey, finance and politics are so mixed up that it is inevitable that in finding treaty terms acceptable to Turkey and France political considerations must carry great weight.I shall be prepared, if the situation arises, to make suggestions with regard to other possible concessions, military, economic and judicial, which might render our proposals more palatable to the Kemalist Turks. But it would perhaps be premature to dilate upon them now.My general conclusion, however, is that if something like the terms I have sketched could be agreed upon by the three Principal Allies and offered jointly and firmly to the Greeks and Kemalists in the near future, a settlement should not be found impossible. -As regards procedure, apart from M. Gounaris&apos; proposal to come to London in the middle of this month, a preliminary informal discussion with the Greeks seems essential, if only because we do not know their present attitude, and more especially because it seems absolutely necessary that His Majesty&apos;s Government should do their utmost to persuade them to take the line advocated above regarding Smyrna. The present position of the Greeks in Asia Minor is, after all, largely due to the mandate originally given them by the Supreme Council; and His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs obligations towards Greece, however slight they may be legally and on paper, render it desirable that we should treat their susceptibili-ties as far as possible with consideration, at any rate until we see whether friendly but strong persuasion fails to succeed. If the objection be raised that such a discussion would make it appear that we intended to back the Greeks strongly in the approaching conference, we could meet it by explaining to the French in advance what line we intend to take with the Greeks, and possibly by even suggesting that they should take steps to sound Angora in the same way as we are sounding the Greeks as to their attitude towards the conference and terms of peace.   The French may be in a better position to do this than we.The next step after discussion with the Greeks would appear to be to call an Allied Conference and to try to obtain an Allied agreement as to the main terms to be offered to both Greece and Turkey. The partial agreement reached at Paris in June would form the natural basis for such a resumption of Allied discussion, but the Allies should then be in a better position to know the Greek, and possibly the Kemalist, attitude, and it seems essential to remove the deadlock regarding Thrace which existed in June at Paris.
After the Supreme Council have reached agreement on the main modifications of the Treaty of Sevres to be proposed to both sides the Greeks and Turks might then be invited to attend, the invitation to Angora again being made through the Turkish Government at Constantinople. The latter point might perhaps be waived if necessary to ensure Kemalist acceptance of the invitation.Mr. Churchill in his recent memorandum to the Cabinet has proposed that the Allied terms when agreed upon should, if necessary, be enforced by the Allied Powers by blockade or by assistance to one side or the other, in order to assure that the unreasonable party be brought to heel. It seems impossible to come to a decision on this point until there has been another Allied discussion and friendly mediation has again been tried. Even then it can hardly be contemplated, unless the Greeks are intolerably unreasonable, that we should assist Kemalist Turkey against Greece. It is difficult to overlook the fact that the Kemalists are the actual, if not the legal, successors of the Turkish Government which waged a five years&apos; war against us, that the Greeks were our Allies until recently, and that they fought for, and the Kemalists against, the Treaty which was signed by all the-Allies a year ago, and, lastly, that the Kemalists have shown continual and bitter hostility to us ever since the London Conference. The Kemalists may generally wish, or at any rate circumstances may now make them ready, to change this attitude if more favourable terms are offered them, but time alone can show their good faith. Only a hopelessly intractable attitude on the part&apos;of the Greeks would, therefore, seem to justify our forcing our terms on the latter by help to the Kemalists. There are stronger grounds, already indicated, for enforcing our terms on the Kemalists, if they are unreasonable, but such a policy would require a change of French and Italian opinion, for which it is difficult to hope. In the circumstances it would seem better not to consider at this stage any form of forcible mediation.It will be seen, therefore, that I endorse the plea for an early handling of the case, and this plea is undoubtedly strengthened by the fears so naturally expressed by Mr. Churchill that a failure to come to terms with the Turks may gravely prejudice the situation in Mesopotamia, the burden of which he has undertaken with so much courage, but where the balance may easily be deflected to his detriment.On the other hand, Mr. Montagu&apos;s complaint that by the attitude of the Foreign Office we are prevented from exercising any influence at Angora, that we can conceive of nothing but official representation there, and that the consequences of our apathy are disastrous, seems to me quite unfounded.We have lost no opportunity presented to us of getting, into touch with Mustapha Kemal and of ascertaining his views. We received Bekir Sami Bey when he came as the official representative of the Kemalist Government to London last year, and we inade proposals and concluded agreements with him which were ignominously and, in the case of our prisoners, most dishonourably thrown over by Mustapha Kemal when his delegation returned to Angora. As regards our prisoners, Mustapha Kemal not merely Broke this engagement, but has treated oux prisoners, including officers of high distinction, with great indignity, ultimately forcing us, in order to extricate them before; the forthcoming winter, to. conclude a bargain against which the Commander-in-chief at Malta has just protested as deplorable and humiliating.Nevertheless, when Mustapha Kemal showed an inclination to be brought personally into touch with us last July through General Harington, we at once gave authority to the latter to proceed. Nothing came of it because Mustapha Kemal sought to attach the acceptance of his extreme political claims as a condition to discussion.Mustapha Kemal can let us know his views any day that he pleases through his personal friend and former colleague, Izzet Pasha, now Foreign Minister at Constantinople, or through his liaison officer there, Hamid Bey, with both of whom our High Commissioner is in constant contact. He has other emissaries in Europe: Dr. Nihad Rechad, Jami Bey and Bekir Sami, who can approach us when-ever they please.No private person has been stopped or dissuaded from going to Angora except General Townshend, whose qualifications were not considered suitable. As regards the unofficial representatives of our Allies, I cannot think that their reception and experience there have been particularly encouraging. Count Sforza gained nothing whatever by his prolonged flirtation with Mustapha Kemal except the final refusal of the latter to receive the Italian representative, Signor Tuozzi, at all.   The French first tried to come to terms with Mustapha Kemal through
M. du Caix, their representative in Syria, who negotiated the armistice preparatory to a treaty. They next made a separate agreement with Bekir Sami about Cilicia and their prisoners, which was at once thrown over by Mustapha Kemal and the National Assembly. Since then they have spent the best part of a year in trying to negotiate a substitute, first, in Paris, with Bekir Sami Bey (who was once again thrown over by Mustapha Kemal), and secondly, at Angora, through the instrumen-tality of M. Franklin-Bouillon, who has paid two, if not three, visits to Angora, and is believed, though officially disavowed by the French Government, to have made or to be making some, arrangement confined to French prisoners and the Cilician frontier.These examples are not particularly encouraging. Nor can I see the slightest reason to suppose that had any Englishman, official or unofficial, been at Angora during the last six months the results would have been very different. More probably he would have experienced the fate of Colonel Rawlinson. The time may come I hope it may not be long delayed-when we can again attempt to enter into relations with Angora, while not I hope forgetting that there is still such a thing as a Government at Constantinople, to which our High Commissioner is accredited, and without whose concurrence we cannot negotiate any settlement at all. But isolated action will not help us to solve the larger problem any more than it has already helped the Italians and the French. The problem remains an international problem, and the steps now to be taken for its settlement are in my judgment these : (a.) A very early effort to ascertain what are the bases on which mediation can now take place with a reasonable prospect of success-such effort involving an urgent conference with the Greeks, upon whom we alone can exercise a friendly pressure, to be accompanied or followed by a similar attempt to resume discussion with the Turks.(&amp;.) As soon as the bases have been provisionally determined, a meeting of the Supreme Council to draw up the proposed revision of the Treaty of Sevres.(c.) A summons to Greeks and Turks to attend and receive the revised conditions.C. of K.Foreign Office, October 7,1921.

Annex III.Text of &quot; National Pact &quot; as printed in the Proceedings of the Turkish Chamber of Deputies of February 17, 1920.The members of the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies recognise and affirm that the independence of the State and the future of the nation can be assured by complete respect for the following principles, which represent the maximum of sacrifice which can be undertaken in order to achieve a just and lasting peace, and that the continued existence of a stable Ottoman Sultanate and society is impossible outside of the said principles : First Article.-Inasmuch as it is.necessary that the destinies of the portions of the Turkish Empire which are populated exclusively by an Arab majority, and which on the conclusion of the Armistice of the 30th October, 1918, were in the occupation of enemy forces, should be determined in accordance with the votes which shall be freely given by the inhabitants, the whole of those parts, whether within or outside the said Armistice line, which are inhabited by an Ottoman Mbsleni majority, united in religion, in race and in aim, imbued with sentiments of mutual respect for each other and of sacrifice, and wholly respectful of each other&apos;s racial and social rights and surrounding conditions, form a whole which does not admit of division for any reason in truth or in ordinance.Second Article.-We accept that, in the case of the three sanjaks, which united themselves by a general vote to the mother-country when they first were free, recourse should again be had, if necessary, to a free popular vote.Third Article. The determination of the juridical status of Western Thrace also, which has been made dependent on the Turkish peace, must be effected in accordance with the votes which shall be given by the inhabitants in complete freedom.Fourth Article. The security of the city of Constantinople, which is the seat of the Caliphate of Islam, the capital of the Sultanate and the headquarters of the Ottoman Government, and of the Sea of Marmora must be protected from every danger. Provided this principle is maintained, whatever decision may be arrived at jointly by us and all other Governments concerned, regarding the opening of the Bosphorus to. the commerces and traffic of the world, is valid.Fifth Article.- The rights of minorities as defined in the treaties concluded between the Entente Powers and their enemies and certain of their associates shall be confirmed and assured by us, in reliance on the belief that the Moslem minorities in neighbouring countries also will have the benefit of the same rights.Sixth Article. It is a fundamental condition of our life and continued existence that we, like every country, should enjoy complete independence and liberty in the matter of assuring the means of our development in order that our national and economic development should be rendered possible, and that it should be possible to conduct affairs in the form of a more up-to-date regular administration.For this reason we are opposed to restrictions inimical to our development in political, judicial, financial and other matters.The conditions of settlement of our proved debts shall likewise not be contrary to these principles.January 28, 1920.
