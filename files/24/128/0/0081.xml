HOURS OOKVKHTIOIl OF THS WASHINGTON CONFERENCE.IHTBRNATION AL LABOUR OROaIISaTIOB.MI^RAHDUMBY TBS PaZIJAMIMTABY SECRETARY OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR.1.      In accordance with the directions of the Cabinet, the Ministry of Labour wrote on 2 nd July, to the Bireotor of the International Labour Office stating that the British Government were unable to ratify the Hours Convention adopted by the Washington Conference, and drawing attention to the difficulties (e,g. hours of railwaymen as established by agreement between the Companies and the Railwaymen, and over-time arrangements), whioh prevented ratification of the Convention.     In this letter it was suggested, as directed by the Cabinet, that a fresh Conference should be held with a view to securing a new and more elastic Hours Convention.2.      The Director of the International Labour Office has circulated a Draft Report for consideration by the Governing Body, (copy of which is annexed hereto).      M. Thomas points out in that Report the serious difficulties which arise in consequence of the decision of H.M. Government not to ratify the Hours Convention in its present form.     He draws attention to the fact that certain Members of the Organisation have already enacted legislation which fully oomplies with the Hours Convention and (in some oases) have formally ratified that Convention.    M. Thomas claims that it would be unfair to those Governments to re-open the question.
3.      I learn from various quarters that probably M, Thomas&apos; argument will be accepted by the Governing Body at Its next meeting on the 19th October, and by the General Conference of the Organisation which is to be held at Geneva a week later, and that the proposal of a further Conference on Hours will be rejected.4.      M, Thomas makes an alternative suggestion, viz. that the jurisdiction conferred upon the Governing Body by articles 409 - 415 of the Treaty of Versailles in respeot   &quot; of cases of non-compliance with the requirements of a duly ratified convention can be exercised by analogy in regard to the interpretation of a convention vis-a-vis a Government which has not ratified it:   And that the Governing Body might give a formal opinion that Ratification by the British Government was not incompatible with the Railway and Overtime Agreements.     A case has been submitted to the law Officers for their opinion on the powers of the Governing Body in this respect; but there does not appear to be any doubt that, strictly speaking, the Governing Body have no legal power to interpret conventions in the way proposed.5..     If the Governing Body adopt the Directors proposal and claim to give a formal opinion on the lines suggested, (assuming a &quot;representation&quot; hs.s been made to them), they presumably would publish a Statement under Article 410, and possibly the matter might be brought before the Permanent Court of International Justice under Article 4 2,    1 though I ao not think this likely,
6*     M.Thomas then makes a further suggestion, viz. that he should he authorised to discuss the matter with H.M. Government, with a view to explaining his proposals.Assuming that the Governing Body and the General Conference of the Organisation reject the proposal for a further Conference, it is suggested that the next best course   is to accept the suggestion that M.Thomas should discuss the position further with the Government, provided that discussion Includes the whole position, and not merely the proposed procedure under Article 409 etc.   Industrial conditions this winter are likely to be difficult.   In the interval between the Conference and the next meeting of the Governing Body in the Spring, M.Thomas would visit this country and in consultation with him the whole situationv.. . :.: r    .....:- &apos; &apos;. &apos; - . \..    &apos;1 .&apos;. v    ..... ...      -   :..       . . .   ......:   &apos;    - ;     ......     .could be more fully explored on both dides.7.     I therefore ask the Cabinet to authorise me,&apos; as british Representative on the Governing Body and as seniorBritish Delegate at the forthcoming International LabourConference to adopt the following position on behalf ofH.M. Government:-(1) That H.M. Government adheres to the proposal previously made to discuss the whole matter at a further conference.(2) That in the view of H.M. Government Articles409 etc. do not confer on the Governing Body any powers to give a formal opinion as suggested.(3) But that If (l) be not accepted, the labour ministry be authorised to discuss the whole matter with the Director9 between the closing of the conference and the next meeting of the Governing Body in the Spring.6th October, 1921.C.A.

INTERNATIONAL   LABOUR   OFFICE.NINTH SESSION OF THE GOVERNING BODY GENEVA, 19th October, 1921.Fifth Item ou the Agenda.THE APPLICATION OF THE CONVENTION OP THE HOURS OF LABOURLETTER OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.Information has been given in the Official Bulletin and in the summaries communicated to the Governing Body at each of its Sessions relating to the action taken In the different countries as regards the ratification of the Washington Con-vention.     This information included such details a3 were avail-able with respect to the situation in Great Britain and in particular, the answers given In the House of Commons by the Minister of Labour and a summary of the important points arising during the debates which took place on the 29th April and 1st July.     It will be remembered that it appeared, from the speech of Dr. Macnamara, the Minister for Labour, in the latter of these debates, that two main obstacles had been encountered by the British Government, namely the existence of agreements betweenthe Railway Companies and the Railway Trade Unions which do nottseem to be in accordance with the terms of the Convention and the question of the regulation of overtime.     The Minister of Labour pointed out that, although no legislation existed in Great Britain, nevertheless a working week of 48 hours or less was effectively secured to the great majority of the working population by collective agreements.The difficulties then Indicated by the Minister of Labour have now been more precisely defined in a letter addressed to the Cabinet which has been forwarded to the Secretary-General of
the League and communicated by him to the International Labour Office.     The terms of this letter, which was reproduced in the Official Bulletin of 17th August, are as follows:-From the Secretary of the Ministry of Labour to the Secretary of the Cabinet.22nd July, 1921.Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Labour to refer to the Draft Convention regulating hours of work in industrial under-takings which was adopted at the first meeting of the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation held at Washington In November 1919.2.        As you are aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government have recently had under consideration the possibility of ratifying this Con-vention, and I am now to request that you will transmit to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations the following in-f information.3.        Two principles would appear to be contained in the Conven-tion adopted, first, that the working hours of persons employed in industrial undertakings shall not exceed 8 in the day and 48 in the week, with certain specified exceptions, and, secondly, that overtime hours in excess of the daily or weekly maximum are in effect prohibited, with permanent exceptions In the case of &quot;preparatory or complementary work&quot;, and temporary exceptions so that, &quot;establishments may deal with exceptional cases of pressure of work&quot;&apos;.There are, in the opinion of His Majesty^ Government, difficulties Inherent in the present industrial conditions in this country which prevent the complete acceptance of these principles as set forth in the Draft Convention.4.        The first principle, namely, the fixing of a standard maxi-mum normal working week, has already received general recognition in the industrial undertakings in the United Kingdom.     By industrial agreements in the different trades, varying in detail, but with the same purpose, the normal hours of work in almost all Industrial undertakings are 48 a week or less.     The system of a daily maximum of 8 hours is not accepted to the same extent in view of the universal recognition of the principle of a half-holiday on Saturday.     The extent to which the position is covered will be appreciated when it is stated that it is esti-mated that from 10 to 12 millions of workpeople in the United Kingdom (about 70 or 80 per cent, of the total employed popula-tion and practically the whole of those employed in industrial undertakings, including engineering and shipbuilding, mining, railways, docks, textiles, building and constructional work)
are covered by agreements fixing a normal working week of 48 hours or less.    Although these Industrial agreements have not the force of law, they operate in practice, and workpeople in this country have thus obtained by agreement a considerable measure of the protection which the Draft Convention is designed to secure.5.      The majority of agreements limiting the hours of employment also make provision with respect to overtime, fixing a higher rate of pay, e.g, time and a quarter, time and a half.     In general, however, the extent to which overtime may be worked is determined by the individual needs of separate establishments subject to agreements between representative organisations of employers and workpeople in the trades concerned.     In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, a more rigid method of limiting overtime, whether by legislation or statutory orders, will not prove so satisfactory as this elastio system of Industrial agreement.6.      In addition the Convention applies to the &quot;transport of passengers and goods by rail&quot; .     By two agreements, to which the Railway Companies, the Railway Trade Unions and the Ministry of Transport attach great importance, the system adopted on the railways in the Waited Kingdom is an 8-hour day and a 48-hour week, exclusive of the daily overtime (paid for at   enhanced rates) which is necessary to the efficient working of the rail-ways, and exclusive, in addition, of Sunday duty, which falls at regular intervals.     It does not appear to His Majesty!s Govern-ment that the maintenance of these agreements would be con-sistent with the terms of the Draft Convention, and having regard to the views of the parties interested in the agreements, His Majesty&apos;s Government regret that they do not see their way to take steps to abrogate the agreements.7.      In view, therefore, of these difficulties, His majesty&apos;s Government have no option but to deoide that they cannot ratify the Convention,*8.      His ?f&apos;ajesty&apos;s Government understand that other countries are experiencing difficulties somewhat similar to those indi-cated In this comrriunication and they are of opinion that it might be advisable that the whole question should be re-considered at a future Conference, the ain of such a conference being to adopt a new Hours Convention, retaining those pro-visions of the Washington Convention which have proved generally acceptable in the light of recent experience, and omitting or modifying those which may appear to be too inelastic for the varying needs of the different industries in the respective countries,9.      To this end they propose to suggest to the Governing Body of the Organisation that it might consider the advisability of plaolng the question on the Agenda of the General Conference of the Organisation in order that the necessary arrangements for a conference to deal with the question may be made.10.     I am finally to ask you to convey to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations a declaration on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government that they would be prepared whole-heartedly to co-operate in the holding of such a conference
and In the attempt to draw up a convention sufficiently.elastic to meet with general acceptance.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd). J.E. MASTERTQN-SMITH.Permanent Secretary, Mini s try of Lab our.It will be noted that this letter puts forward officially the two difficulties referred to above, and concludes with the proposal that the Governing Body should consider the possibilityof a solution by bringing the matter before a General Conference of the Organisation with a view to the adoption of a new hours convention containing somewhat more elastic provisions.In the consideration which the Governing Body will becalled upon to give to this matter there are, therefore, two distinct but related points.     First, the nature cf the diffi-culties themselves, and secondly, the solution which the BritishGovernment suggests should be adopted in this particular case.The question is obviously of the greatest possibleimportance for the Governing Body will realise, in view of theinformation which has been laid before it with regard to pro-grees of ratifications from time to time, and in view of the declarations which were made by certain of its members at itslast meeting, that the decision taken by Great Britain withregard to the Hours Convention will have the greatest influence and may even be a deciding factor in the decisions which will betaken by other Members of the Organisation.    Other IndustrialStates are naturally reluctant to bind themselves to the termsof the Convention until they are certain that great industrialStates will do likewise, and smaller States will naturallyhesitate until they see what action la taken by States whoseindustrial importance and experience are greater than their own., The ratification of the- German Government will probably
be influenced by the decision of Great Britain.   Belgium, although she has adopted legislation in conformity with the Washington Convention, has indicated that her ratification must depend upon the ratification by Great Britain and other great industrial States, and Holland has taken up the same attitude.In Italy the Parliamentary Commission whioh examined the question of the ratification of the Draft Convention proposed to adjourn its examination of the question on the ground that certain Governments whioh were parties to the negotiations of the Draft had not ratified, and the Government declared itself in agreement with the Commission&apos;s point of view.She letter of tha Ministry of Labour suggests that the solution to be adopted is the consideration by a General Con-ference of a new Hours Convention.   Apart from the consideration as to whether this solution may be that best fitted for applica-tion to the present case, the question is evidently a general one of great importance for the future of the Organisation, as the circumstances in which it has arisen may be expected to recur.   It can scarcely be hoped that the International Labour Conference will always adopt Conventions which are so carefully drafted that they meet every possible difficulty which may bo met with when they are examined in the respective countries after the Conference with a view to their ratification.   Hence the action which is taken in the present case may be expected to determine largely the procedure which will be followed in similar cases in the future.   For this reason it is perhaps to be regretted that the British Government did not take the course of communicating officially fcts difficulties to the International Labour Office in order that all possible means of meeting them might have been explored before deciding to suggest the solution of a fresh Conference and a fresh Convention which,as pointed out above, if adopted, may condition the whole future procedure of the Organisation.
It is for this reason that I would suggest that the two points raised in the Ministry of l&amp;bour&apos;s letter, namely, thedifficulties themselves and the solution which is proposed should he oarefully distinguished.As regards the question of the Railwayman^ agreement, the British Government is obviously and rightly preoccupied with the considernation that since in its opinion the terms of the agreement are not in conformity with the provisions of the Washington Con-vent ion, if the Washington Convention were ratified it would lay itself open to a complaint that the Convention was not being observed.   It is naturally reluctant to override by legislation anagreement recently concluded after long negotiations between the railwaymen and the Railway Companies., and approved by the Ministryof Transport.   On the other hand, it is a matter for consideration as to whether the agreement as it stands is, in fact, incontradiction with the provisions of the Washington Convention..,andwhether, if so, certain slight modifications might not be accepted in it by both the Railwaymen and by the Railway Companies.   Shequestion of the application of the Convention to railways was raised at Washington and was discussed by the Commission which drewup the terms of the Convention and which believed that it had made provision for sufficient elasticity to meet any difficulties whichwould arise.   In this connection it may be remembered that one ofthe advisers to the British employers&apos; delegate was Mr. HowardWilliams, the Assistant Manager of the L. and H.W.Railway.The British Railway agreement provides for an 8&quot;hour day and a48 hour working week of 6 days.   It oould, apparently, be held that such a case was covered by Article 6 which provides thatregulations may be made by public authority to&quot;determine the permanent exceptions that may be allowed in complementary work which must necessarily be carried on out-side the limits laid down for the general working of an establishment
and, further, that those regulations shall he made only after consultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned.Since the normal working week on the British railways is one of 6 days and, in view of the absence of any definition in the Convention or elsewhere as to the meaning to be attached to &quot;the limits laid down for the general working of an establishment&quot;, it would seem possible to hold that Sunday work on the railways could be brought under the exception provided for in irticle 6. The British Government, however, apparently considers that if it adopted this interpretation such interpretation might subse-quently be challenged and a complaint might be made that it was not observing the Convention which It had ratified.In the face of each a difficulty it is clear that the British Government is entitled to take every possible precaution against the possibility of any charge of bad faith being subsequently laid against it.   On the other hand, it should not be forgotten that the decision is not purely a domestic one, but should take account of the position of Great Britain as a Member of the International labour Organisation, and its possible effect on the Organisation as a whole.   The adoption of the draft Convention in question was a collective act of the International labour        ^ Organisation and undoubtedly Its Interpretation must be held to be a matter of international concern.It is therefore of interest to note the procedure whioh has been followed by other Members of the Organisation when difficulties of interpretation have arisen.   They have displayed a solicitude to ensure that their interpretations should be in accord with the general opinion of the Organisation and they have made a practice of communicating their difficulties to the International labour Office and asking for its opinion.   The Offioe has always pointed
out that, although, no spooial authority is oonf erred upon it by the Treaty to give interpretations of the provisions of draft Conventions, nevertheless, it considers that it is fulfilling the function for which it was intended in endeavouring, by supplying them with as complete information as possible as to what would appear to have been the intention of the Commission or the Conference which elaborated the Convention, to secure that the decision which they take should be in accord with the interpretation which would seem to have been generally given.   In this way the office believes that it is performing a useful function by securing in as large a measure as possible that the interpretations given by the Members of the Organisation should be uniform.   Where consultations of this kind have taken place, the point of difficulty raised and tho reply of the Office have been published   in the Official Bulletin for the information of all the Members of the Organisation.   The interpretation which would appear to be indicated by the information which the Office has been able to supply has in no case been contested by the Member of the Organisation concerned, and no objection has been raised by any Member of the Organisation to whom it has been communicated through the medium of the Official Bulletin.More recently it has happened that the same point of inter-pretation has been raised by more than one Member of the Orgahisa-tion.   In those oases the Office has been able to point out that when the point was previously raised and it was consulted thereon, the information supplied by it and the conclusion to which it appeared to lead had been accepted by the Member in question and had given rise to no objection after publication in the Official Bulletin. The process of the development of interna-tional law is, in fact, an eraebiOy similar process, and the tacit
acceptance of an interpretation acted on by a Member and communicated through the Official Bulletin constitutes lm-portant authority whfch can always be invoked for that inter-pretation.Had the difficulties of the British Government been offlci-ally co.-amunicated to the Office in accordance with the procedure which has been generally aocepted by the other Members of the Organisation, it might conceivably have led to some solution. It is, of course, realised that it is possible that the prooedure indicated above might not have been considered by the British Government as giving it sufficient guarantees against the possi-bility of any complaint of non-observance in the future.   It would seem, however, that this guarantee might have been obtained by carrying the procedure a stage further and by submitting any interpretation to which the Government attached special impor-tanoe or in respect of whioh it desired to cover itself by all possible safeguards, to the approval of the Governing Body.   This point I propose to deal with more fully below.She second difficulty raised by the British Government is now presented in the letter of the Ministry of Labour in a form somewhat different from that indicated in the various replies which were given to questions in the House of Commons and in the speeohes of the Ministers during the course of the two debates which took place on the Washington Conventions.   The letter of the Ministry of Labour after having indicated that overtime Is regulated in Great Britain by collective agreements, states that &apos;in the opinion of. His Majesty^ Government a more rigid method of limiting overtime whether by legislation or statutory orders will not prove so satisfactory as this elastic system of Indus-trial agreement/1.The precise meaning of this sentence Is not altogether clear.   On the face of it it would seem to infticate that the
British Government declares that no limitation of overtime should be imposed other than such limitation as may be ensured by collective agreements which have no legislative sanction. It would seem difficult to believe that the British Government, In view of ita proposals at the Peaoe Conference in Paris, when the British delegates proposed the insertion in Article 427 of the clause relating to the establishment of the 8 hour day and 48 hour week, and in view of the attitude taken by its delegates at the Washington Conference, should now intend to suggest that there should be no legislative limitation of overtime whatsoever. Such a proposal would, in fact, amount to a oomplete negation of the whole principle   upon which the Washington Convention is founded.If, however, all that is meant is what would appear to have been indicated in the various answers and speeches of Ministers in the House of Comerons, namely, that the British Government felt that Article 5 and 6 of the draft Convention required the f cr-mal assent of the Government to every case in which hours were worked in excess of 48 per week other than in those cases pro-vided for in Article 3 and 4 (Emergency and Continuous Industries,) the difficulty would seem to be simply a question of the inter-pretation to be given to Articles5 and 6.   Here again it would seem that the interpretation of the British Government 1b unduJy rigid and that it could reasonably be held that all that the Govern-ment would be required to do would be to fix by administrative order in agreement with the Organisations of Employers and workers the maximum limits within which overtime might be worked and that these orders might be of a general character applying to a whole industry or even a group of industries.Assuming, therefore, that the difficulty with regard to over-time is not to be taken as an objection by the British Government to the fundamental idea underlying the whole of the draft Convention it would appear that the two points raised in the letter of the Ministry of labour are really questions of interpretation with
regard to tha action whioh is permissible under the terms of the Convention.It now remains to examine the solution which is suggested by the British Government, and any possible alternatives.The   British Government suggests that the whole question should be considered at a future Conference, the object of whioh would be to adopt a new Hours Convention, retaining those provisions which have proved generally acceptable, and omitting or modifying those whioh appear to be too inelastic for the varying needs of the different industries in the respective oountries.In the first place, it is doubtful whether the inelasticity of provisions of the Convention to which the British Government refers has been generally felt.   As pointed out above, the greatest difficulty whioh has been met with as regards the ratification of this Convention is the hesitation of many oountriea, and in parti -cular of the smaller oountiiee, to commit themselves to ratifica-tion until they are sure of the aotion which will be taken by the great industrial countries, and, in particular, by Great Britain, For instance, the difficulty whioh has been felt as to ratifioa-tion in respect of Sweden would not be solved by the adoption of any such new Convention as the British Government suggests.   The obstacle there is not that the existing Swedish legislation does not conform in detail with the provisions of the Washington Con--vention, but that the Swedish Act was deliberately adopted for 4 years as an experiment, and is subject to revision at the end. of that period.   The Swedish Government, therefore, find it im-possible in the face of this formal decision of the Swedish Par-liament, which was taken before the Washington Conference, to ask Parliament to modify its legislation now before toe period cf experiment has expired, and to bind itself for a period of 10 years as required by the Convention.
-    406It is doubtful, therefore, whether a new Conference and a new Convention are required by the needs of other States, and the question should really be examined from the point of view of deciding as to whether it is or is not the best solution whioh oan be found for the British difficulty.It will be evident at once that there are very serious objections to its adoption.   In the first place, it should be recognised that the present oiroumstancos are by no means suitable for the reopening of a complicated negotiation which only achieved successful results with great difficulty, even in the favourable atmosphere which surrounded the de liber a-tions of the Washington Conference.   Those parties to the negotiation which have succeeded in achieving agreement on a large number of delicate points may be expected to oppose any attempt   to reopen the whole question now.There is a seoond and an even greater difficulty, e^u supposing that anything like general consent to the reopening of the question could be obtained, and clearly, unless such general consent ware forthcoming, it would be useless to adopt the method proposed.   This difficulty is tnat a number of countries have already, as a result of the lashlngton Confer-enoe, either ratified the Convention or have adopted legisla-tion to give it effect.   That legislation is in strict conformity with the provisions of the Washington Convention as they now stand.   Article 405 of the Treaty contains a  r clause which states that &quot;in no case shall any Member be ashed or required, as a result of the adiption of any Recom-mendation or draft Convention by the Conference, to lessen the protection afforded by its existing legislation to the workers concerned.&quot;It will readily be seen that,- assuming the Conference were to adopt a new Hours   Convention, the position of those countries which have loyally satisfied the decisions of the
Washington Conference would be extremely difficult,   They would be unable, in view of the clause quoted above, to revise the legislation they had already adopted in conformity with the original Convention, and they might, nevertheless, be placed at a serious disadvantage in comparison with those countries which remained free to ratify the new Convention. It may be regarded as certain, therefore, that such oountries would feel compelled to oppose strongly the reopening of the whole question of the adoption of a fresh Convention.Hence it may be taken that, generally speaking, con-si considerable   opposition may be expected to the proposal which the British Government has made and that, therefore, it is doubtful whether it provides the most feasible solution of the difficulties to which they have drawn attention,There Is, however, a third difficulty of a practical character whioh would seem to be final.The British Government was responsible at Paris for the insertion of the Clause relating to the eight hour day and the forty-eight hour week in Article 427,   The British Government was closely associated with the drafting of the proposed draft Convention, whioh was laid before the Washington Conference by the Organising Committee, and which was in fact based on the recommendations of the Provisional Committee of the British Industrial Conference whioh were incorporated in a Bill introduced by the Government in the House of Commons. Again, the British representatives, Including both the repre-BentativeB of employers and workers, played a very prominent part in the work of the Commission at Washington, which shaped the final decisions of the Washington Conference on this subject.   Mr. Barnes has already indicated in the House of Commons that the general lines of his policy at Washington were definitely approved by his Government at home.   In spite
of the fact that this very full and lengthy consideration was given to the question, and in spite of the fact that the British representatives were closely ooncemed with evory stage of the development of the text, the difficulties which have subsequently come to light have led to the present situation in which the British Government declares that it is unablo to ratify,   ihat guarantee oan the International labour Organisation have that, supposing the present proposal of the British Government were accepted, and a Conference were convened at which the question was reopened and at which a new text was arrived at, the same kind of difficulty would not recur?   Undoubtedly, if one could be certain that the adoption of the procedure proposed in the Ministry of Labour&apos;s letter was bound to result in the ratification by Great Britain of a new Convention, there would be very strong arguments in favour of acoepting it, but it seems clear that no such result can be guaranteed, and that, therefore, the confusion and friction which would be involved in reopening the whole question might be without any beneficial result whatever.In these circumstances, it seems desirable to examine the possibility of adopting eome other solution if such can be found.It has been suggested above that the real difficulty of the British Government is presumably the desire that it should not bind itself to fulfil the terms of the Convention unless it is certain that the measures which it finds it possible to take will be regarded as a sufficient fulfilment of its obligation, and unless it haB e complete guarantee that no accusation of bad faith oan subsequently be levelled against it.   Seasons have been given above for suggesting that a careful examination of the texts of the Convention
might justify the opinion that the 3ritish Government&apos;s reading of those toxts is unduly strict and that a reading of them whioh would enable ratification to take place would be generally accepted by the International Labour Organisation.     It has also been Indicated that in many oases of similar difficulties, but cases whioh were adrait-tedly of less importance, Members of the International Labour Organisation have had recourse to the International Labour Office for the supply of information and advice. &apos; In view of the entirely praiseworthy scruples of the British Government and of the importance which it attaches to the meticulous fulfilment of its obligations, the application of the procedure of a consultation with the Office may perhaps appear insufficient in this case.    It is suggested, therefore that the procedure should be completed by laying the information and the suggestions which, after careful esramina-tion, tho Office may feel able to make, before the Governing Body for their consideration and for their formal approval if they so deoide.It is suggested that the Governing Body should give careful consideration to this proposed procedure.   In the first place, as pointed out above, the objections to a new Conference seem to be overwhelming.    In the second place, however, it seems that the International Labour Organisation must secure some procedure whereby difficulties of the kind which have been met by the British Government can be dealt with and solved.   As has been pointed out above, it is impossible to imagine that every Conference will always adopt every Convention so exactly and so clearly drafted that it will meet every conceivable circumstance arising in every oountry and will not be susceptible of differences of inter-pretation.
The solution which would consist in an examination of the question-by the Governing Body and an expression of its opinion thereon, therefore, requires to be examined from two points of view,   First, as to whether it possesses any legal validity, and, secondly, as to Whether it could provide the British Government with the guarantees against any future charge of bad faith against which it quite rightly wishes to safeguard itself.It will be remembered that tha Treaty Itself lays down in Article 409 and subsequent Articles that, if any representation is made to the International labour Office that a Member has failed to secure In any respect the effective observance of a Convention to tihioh it is a party, the Governing Body shall be oalled upon to decide whether or not the sanctions provided by the Treaty should be put into operation. Under the Articles in question no Commission of Enquiry eaa be set up and no appeal can be made to the Court of Inter-national Justice until the Governing Body has taken the first decision on the matter.   She Governing Body is, therefore, constituted by the Treaty as the first Court before which any complaint of non-observance of a Convention shall be laid.It seems, therefore, entirely reasonable that any Member which has any reason to suppose that there may be a doubt as to the interpretation which it proposes to give to an Article of a Convention should appeal to the Governing Body for its opinion.   Clearly, if the Governing Body, having carefully considered any such proposed interpretation, and having formally approved it, it would bo practically impossible for it at a later stage to go bach on its own decision and to put in operation the machinery of sanctions on a complaint based on the interpretation whioh it had itself accepted.It may be noted also from a consideration of the
general principles which underly the whole construction of the International labour Organisation that the Governing Body is specially fitted to perform this function.     In the first place it contains representatives of the eight chief industrial states, whose right to a permanent seat on the Governing Body may be taken as Indicating their exceptional interest in.all decisions taken by the Organisation, and it o ont sins four Government representatives who are elected by all the other Members of the Organisation.     It contains, further, six employers&apos; and six workers&apos; representatives,      i who represent the whole body of employers and workers in the Organisation.     It is, therefore, directly representative of the whole Organisation and of the three groups which partioi-pate in the Conference.     Any deoision, therefore, which it takes on such a matter is undoubtedly, apart from &apos;the&apos; fact that it is constituted by the Treaty the first Tribunal as regards complaints, to be regarded as possessing an excep-tionsl authority.It is not suggested that the Governing Body should be given or should assume authority to alter in any way the. decisions of the Conference.     Cases might easily arise in which only the adoption by the Conference of an amending Convention would afford a solution required; but, in so far as the Governing Body, under Article 400,.settles the Agenda of the Conference, it is clearly the proper procedure in such a case for the Governing Body to be advised of the difficulty and to decide whether it thinks it is necessary to put the item on the Agenda of the Conference or not.     If the Govern-ing Body thinks that it is neither necessary nor desirable to do so, it would seen to be a reasonable conclusion to assume that the Governing Body would be entitled to express an opinion as to any alternative solution which it might think
feasible.In the present case I am strongly of opinion that this is a procedure which the Governing Body should follow. I am inclined to think: that the British Government has been over-strict in the interpretation which it has given to the Articles of the draft Convention and that the Governing Body, on examination, may be able to come to the opinion that the ratification by Great Britain of the Convention in its present form would be possible.     If Great Britain desires still further guarantees, one further stage might be added,. The- decision of the &apos;Governing Body might be submitted to those Governments which hs.fi already ratified the Convention for an expression of their opinion as to whether they accept the Governing 3ody&apos;s interpretation or not.Those Governments are, in fact, in International Law the Custodians of the Convention and such a procedure would indeed be regarded by international jurists as being valid even as regards en amendment.     A fortiori, therefore, corn-bine d with the procedure indicated above, it provides the British Government with the most absolute guarantee possible, and at the same time initiates a valuable prooedure for the future,Briefly,-therefore, it would seem, for the reasons advanced above, that the proposal to bring the matter before the Conference should be rejected and that the Governing Body should attempt to secure the adoption of the alternative pro-oedure outlined above.     In the latter connection it may perhaps consider it desirable to authorise the Director to discuss the matter with the British Government with a view to explaining the advantages of the procedure suggested and securing its assent to its being followed.It is hardly necessary to emphasise onoe more the
importance of the decision whioh the Governing Body will take upon this question, since, es already pointed out, it involves not only the consideration of the particular (colleagues-* tion brought forward by the British Government, but the laying own of lines of prooedure which would profoundly affect the future of the Organisation.     lurther oases are bound to arise and the need is sure to be increasingly felt for some prooedure whioh will.permit of an authoritative definition of the elasticity allowed by Conventions.     She Governing Body will, I am sure, not shirk: the responsibility which would appear to belong to it under the Treaty, and whioh, if exercised within the limitations indicated above -that is with due regard to the sphere of competence of the Conference - must greatly facilitate the progress of the Organisation towards the great ends for which it was oreated.H.B.- In the appendix herewith will be found details of the length of the normal working week in the principal industries in Great Britain.Geneva, 24th September 1921.
