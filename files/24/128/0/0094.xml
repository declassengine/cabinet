This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. j16SECRET.CP. 3395.THE CABINET.THE  SITUATION  IN IRAQ.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to CP. 3328, circulated by the Colonial Secretary, I think the 121 Cabinet may like to see the following appreciation of the military position in Iraq. 3L. W.-E.2475aThe War Office,12th October, 1921.1. In accordance with the decision taken by the Cabinet in August, 1921, the administrative and financial control of Iraq has now been taken over by the Colonial Office, as from 1st October. It seems, therefore, that this is a suitable occasion for a review of the present military situation in that country, and of possible future eventualities which may affect military policy.2. Regular Garrison. The present military garrison of Iraq consists of: 1 Regiment British Cavalry, - 1 Regiment Indian Cavalry,1 Battery, R.H.A.,1 Brigade, R.F.A.,1 Brigade Pack Artillery,4 Battalions British Infantry, 14 Battalions Indian Infantry,3 Armoured Car Companies,4 Companies, Sappers and Miners,6 Squadrons, R.A.F.,with the necessary complement of administrative services.3. Local Forces. In addition to the above regular troops, there are the following local forces available for the maintenance of internal order : (a.) Arab levies, strength about 4,500, under  British  officers.    This force is administered by the High Commissioner of Iraq and is maintained from colonial Office funds. (6.) The Arab Army, strength about 1,000 (in training).   This force is at presentin course of formation, and has not yet assumed any of its military functions.It is entirely Arab, and is administered and maintained by the ArabGovernment of Iraq.4. Distribution. -The British garrison, mentioned in paragraph 2, is at present distributed roughly as follows.: 1 Infantry Brigade with attached troops in the Mosul area. 2 Infantry Brigades with attached troops in the Baghdad area.The remainder of the Infantry is%disposed at the Base and at various points on the Tigris Lines of Communication, the Euphrates line, north of Nasiriyeh, being in charge of the Arab levies, with a small British detachment at the Hindiyeh barrage.(B21/336)   100   10/21  h&amp;s, Ltd.   9495wo
5. Future reductions. During the course of this winter the British garrison will undergo further steady reductions until, by the end of March, 1922, it will consist of only 2 British Infantry Battalions.6 (or 7) Indian Infantry Battalions.2 Batteries, R.F.A.1 Indian Pack Battery.1 Armoured Car Company.1 Sappers and Miners Company.6 Squadrons, R.A.F.These reductions are, however, dependent on the ability of the Arab Army to assume control of the whole of the Mosul Vilayet. Until this can be effected, the opinion of the General Officer Commanding is that it is not possible to reduce the Infantry portion of the garrison below 11 Battalions. He anticipates, however, that the Arab Army will be in a position to relieve his troops in the Mosul area during March, 1922, and that the regular garrison will therefore be reduced to. the figures stated before the hot weather commences iii May.6. Communications. The British forces at Baghdad and beyond are at present connected with their Base, Basrah, by two main lines of communication (a.) By the Euphrates Valley Railway to Baghdad.(b.) By the River Tigris to Kut, and thence either by river on to Baghdad or by the Kut Baghdad Railway. This railway, however, is to be closed -and pulled up on 1st November, and consequently need not be considered.A few remarks on these two main arteries will not be out of place here.(a.) The Euphrates Valley Railway. This line runs from Basrah, via Nasiriyeb, Samawa and the Hillah branch of the Middle Euphrates to Baghdad. Beyond Samawa, for some 120 miles, it traverses a country which is closely intersected by a maze of irrigation canals, streams and nullahs, entailing a very large number of culverts and bridges. It is therefore very much exposed to the risk of interruption by evilly disposed persons, and when once interrupted, it can only be repaired from either end, since the nature of the country prevents repair material being carried by road to the point of damage. Moreover, this railway runs through the region which, out of the whole of Iraq, is perhaps the most open to disorder, owing to its being the great centre of religious fanaticism.(b.) The Tigris. This river is navigable up to Baghdad throughout the year. Navigation, however, is frequentfy difficult and always slow. In the high-water season, i.e., from about January or February until June or July, the current is so strong as to reduce the rate of progress of a steamer with barges to some 3 or 4 miles an hour. And in the low-water season the small depth of water in the channels and the numerous (and constantly shifting) sandbanks cause frequent groundings, with their attendant delays. Below Kut, except for a stretch of about 20 miles in length, known as &quot; The Narrows,&quot; there are, however, no very serious obstacles to navigation. The chief difficulties arise above Kut, where the river takes an exceptionally tortuous course, so much so, indeed, that, while the distance from Kut to Baghdad in a straight line is 98 miles, that by river is 250 miles. The average time taken by a loaded steamer between Basrah and Baghdad is 6 days, of which the journey to Kut&apos;(exactly half-way) usually takes 48 hours.7. The role of the Armed Forces. We see from the above that as from April, 1922, the forces responsible for the maintenance of order in Iraq, and their distribution, will be approximately as follows : (a.) A small regular British force of some eight or nine Battalions, of which thebulk will be stationed at Baghdad, with detachments guarding Basrah andthe Tigris Lines of Communication. (b.) An irregular force of Arab levies, which will be responsible for the safety ofthe Euphrates Railway and for policing outlying districts in the Baghdadand Basrah Vilayets, (c.) A small Arab army, which will be responsible for keeping order in the MosulVilayet.This organization and distribution is based on the essential condition that the armed forces are maintained solely for the preservation of internal order, and that they
-are not intended to defend Iraq against attack from without its borders. In the present temper of the country, which has accepted the accession of King Feisal with -acclamation, there is good reason to hope that we may obtain temporary immunity from an insurrection on a scale similar to that of last year, but that this state of things will last is very doubtful unless our relations with Turkey improve. In any case, it is tolerably certain that internal disorders will accompany, and very probably precede, any organized attack from without, and such risings would have a very great effect on our method of dealing with such attacks.8. Possibility oj external attack. The possible external enemies and the directions from which their attacks might develop are (a.) From the east. Persia.(&amp;.) From the north and north-east. Bolshevik Russia, either alone or in cornbina-tion with Persia, or with independent Kurdish chiefs, (c.) From west and south-west.-The Arabs of Central Arabia. (d.) From north and north-west. Turkey, either alone or in combination withBolshevik Russia.Taking these into consideration seriatim (a.) Persia, by herself, cannot at present be regarded as a serious menace. Her army is a mere rabble of individuals, ill-armed, ill-clothed, unfed and badly paid. Her finances are in a state of chaos; and her Government is so honey-combed with personal intrigues as to bo practically incapable of formulating a policy, and certainly incapable of carrying it out.(6.) We are, of course, aware that hostility to Great Britain is the chief tenet of the Bolshevik faith, and we must therefore expect to be attacked by Prussia wherever and whenever she considers that she can inflict damage upon us. The question is, therefore, whether an attack upon us in Iraq would, if successful, be of such value to Russia as to counterbalance the loss in the event of its non-success. We may take it that Persia, in her present condition, even if not in active co-operation with Russia, would place no obstacles in the way of a military advance on Iraq from the Caspian, and that certain of the Kurdish tribes would assist the Bolshevists in the hope of loot.Assuming then that a Bolshevist attack in force on Baghdad developed and that for any reason we were unable to maintain our position there, but retired to a line covering Basrah and the Ahwaz oil-fields would the Bolsheviks be any better off than before? The answer surely is &quot; No.&quot; To make a further attack and drive us from the country would be a military operation of great magnitude, and we could reinforce our position by sea more rapidly than the enemy could bring down troops via the Caspian and through Persia. True, we might lose some prestige in such a case, but it is doubtful whether this would create much effect in countries outside Iraq. The Bolsheviks, therefore, would only have succeeded, at a vast expenditure . of money, in compelling us to a course of action which we have already contemplated taking without such compulsion. For these reasons a serious attack by the Bolsheviks is considered unlikely.(c.) A deliberate attack by the Arabs from the Arabian deserts may also be classed as unlikely. In order to have any chance of success, a combination of the tribes would be essential, and this, in the practically permanent condition of enmity between the two great sections, is almost unthinkable. The establishment of Feisal as King of Iraq has made such a combination even more improbable than before.(d.) There remains, then, the menace of Nationalist Turkey from the north and north-west, and this is probably the great danger that we have to face. The hostility of Angora to Great Britain is well known, as is also its leaning towards friendship with France. Equally well known is France&apos;s objection to Feisal as a ruler. It may well seem good to the Kemalists, therefore, to endeavour, by one action, to destroy our power in the Middle East, to please the French&quot; by overthrowing the ruler whom we have set up, and at the same time to recover for Turkey a part at least of the territories which were wrested from her in the Great War. Consequently, when her operations against the Greeks are concluded, either by a stalemate or by conclusion of peace, she will very probably turn her eyes to the Mosul Yilayet which, as we have seen, will soon be garrisoned only by a weak and untried Arab Army.
9. The British position. It now remains to consider what action is to be taken by us in the event of attack from without.First of all we must regard it as an axiom that a complete military withdrawal from Iraq is inadmissible, since we cannot afford to leave the Ahwaz oil-fields at the-mercy of any enemy-Turk, Bolshevist, or Persian. Consequently our footing at-Basrah, at least, must be maintained at all costs.The force in the country, as stated above, is not designed to resist external attack. But, at the same time, we have established Feisal as King and are, therefore, morally bound to assist him against aggression.It follows, therefore, that in the event of organized attack from without we shall have to bring troops into the country in order to meet it, and this question is already under discussion with India. But, even under the best circumstances, there is but small chance of (say) even one division of all arms being concentrated at Basrah in less, than about six weeks. And what is going to happen during that time ? Most probably the small Arab Army will be defeated. It will certainly have to retire from Mosul. The enemy will occupy the Mosul Vilayet and will probably advance towards Baghdad. At the same time he will arouse the tribes of the Euphrates, with the result that the Basrah Baghdad railway will be cut, and, in view of a threat to Baghdad, no troops will be available for protecting repair parties. Hence the force at Baghdad will be in a thoroughly unsound military position, some 500 miles from its base, with an organized enemy in front and rebellious tribesmen behind. It will, in fact, be in the position of an advanced guard which has pushed ahead too far of its main body, and is open to defeat before support can arrive. Its communication by river with Basrah will be precarious, should the Tigris tribes rise in concert with those of the Euphrates.      -It appears, therefore, that the only course to pursue will be to withdraw the troops and the Government from Baghdad at the first sign of hostile action and to retire, probably as far as Amara, until reinforcements arrive.That such a course would be distasteful, and that the Arab Government would completely (and probably for ever) lose all its prestige, must be accepted.The only alternative, however, is to remain in Baghdad and there sustain a siege. The troops necessary to relieve a force there would certainly be not less than two divisions, and the despatch of a force of this size would be intensely tinpopular, both in this country and in India, even assuming that requirements elsewhere did not preclude it altogether. And, in any case, its. assembly would be so slow, and the reformation, ab initio, of the river fleet necessary to transport and maintain It would be such a lengthy process, that there would be a grave risk of a disaster to the force in Baghdad before a relieving force could arrive.10. Conclusion.   What, then, is the conclusion to be drawn from these considerations ?It has been seen that, of the possible enemies, Nationalist Turkey is the most probable one. It has been shown that, by allowing her to attack, we risk a possible disaster and a certain loss of prestige, not to mention the waste of all the efforts we have spent on the country. The only solution, therefore, appears t&apos;o be to prevent Angora from attacking Iraq, and the only means to that end is to effect a speedy friendship with Turkey as a whole.
