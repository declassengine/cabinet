r[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1921.SECRET.-&quot;KerfCP. 3369.CABINET.GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND ACT.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.i I CIRCULATE herewith two letters, dated respectively the 22nd and 27th ultimo, which I have received from Sir James Craig. In these letters he urges that full executive powers should be conferred forthwith on the Government of Northern Ireland by the transfer. to that Government of the functions now exercised by various Departments in Ireland in so far as they relate to Northern Ireland.In order to give effect to his wishes it would be necessary simultaneously to transfer a proportion of the staff of the varions Departments that are about to be partitioned together with the duties now carried on by those Departments. Under the Government of. Ireland Act, as explained below, such transfer cannot be effected otherwise than by the carrying out of an exactly similar transfer of staff and Services to Southern Ireland. There is no power under that Act to transfer either personnel or Services to one of the new Irish Governments, while retaining in the hands of the Imperial Government the personnel and Services which would normally be transferred to the remaining Irish Government.The Parliament of Northern Ireland met for the first time on the 7th June last, and on the same day Ministers were appointed and Ministerial Departments constituted by order of the Lord Lieutenant. Executive powers have, not yet been transferred to these Departments, and Sir James Craig complains of the embarrassing position in which he and his Ministers are placed, having the name and many of the responsibilities without the actual powers of a Government.2. The obstacle in the way of transferring services to the Government of Northern Ireland in present circumstances is that the Government of Ireland Act is based on the principle of equal treatment of South and North, the establishment of Parliaments and Governments both in Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the transfer of services and civil servants from the Government of the United Kingdom to the Southern and Northern Governments simultaneously.The Act does not contemplate one part of Ireland being under. a Parliament and Government of its own whilst the other part remains under the Parliament and Government of the United Kingdom. This principle is adhered to in the provision that is made for the contingency of either part of Ireland refusing &quot; to work the Act &quot; (s. 72). That contingency arose on&apos; the 12th July last, less than one-half of the members of the Southern House of Commons having taken the oath as members within the prescribed period which terminated on that date. There are 128 Members of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland. Of these, only four (the Members for Trinity College, Dublin) took the oath. Had the powers given by that section been exercised, the so-called &quot; Crown Colony&quot; government would now be in operation in Southern Ireland; that is to say, the Lord Lieutenant and a nominated committee of Privy Councillors would stand in the place of the constitutional Government of Southern Ireland, and a Legislative Assembly consisting of the said committee and other persons appointed by His Majesty would stand in the place of the Parliament of Southern Ireland, and the remaining steps for bringing the Act into full operation could be taken simultaneously as regards South and North.Bringing the so-called &quot; Crown Colony&quot; government into force would doubtless have prejudiced the negotiations for a conference; but the present position&quot; is that there is no legislative or executive body for Southern Ireland f7038J
which could be invested with powers pari passu with the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland. Three institutions which are essential to the working of the Act depend upon the existence of such bodies in Southern and Northern Ireland, viz., the Joint Exchequer Board, the Civil Service Committee and the Council of Ireland. The existence of a Joint Exchequer Board is essential for the financial provisions of the Act; the main body of civil servants cannot be allocated to either of the new Governments except by the Civil Service Committee, and the public services inconnection with railways, fisheries and the Diseases of Animals Acts cannot pass from the Government of the United Kingdom until the Council of Ireland has been established.It therefore becomes necessary to consider what steps (if any) should be taken to remove the deadlock and to enable the Act to be brought into full operation in Northern Ireland.3. The following would appear to be the alternative courses: (A.) To defer the transfer of further powers to the Northern Government until it is possible to make some forecast of the result of the conference. Under the Act the latest date that can be fixed for the coming into operation of the general provisions of the Act, including the transfer of Services, is the 2nd March, 1922, and if the course here suggested would involve a postponement beyond that date some slight amendment of the Act would be necessary.(B.) To amend the Act radically so as to provide for the complete establishment of a Parliament and Government in the North irrespective of what happens in the South. An amending Bill for this purpose would be complicated and require careful consideration.Sir James Craig has suggested a course which would, in his view, meet the &quot; real crux &quot; of the situation. Briefly, his suggestion is that the existing civil servants who desire to go to&apos;the North should be transferred forthwith. to the Northern Government, the remainder continuing under the United Kingdom Government until they are ultimately transferred to the Government of Southern Ireland or provided for in some other way.To carry out this suggestion it would be necessary to alter section 59 of the Act in so far as it provides for the existing civil servants being allocated between South and North by a Civil Service Committee. A change of this kind is so serious a departure from the provisions of the Act safeguarding the interests of existing civil servants and providing for a fair allocation between the two Governments that it could not properly be effected by an Order in Council, but would require amending legislation. Moreover, it would go a short way only in removing the existing difficulties. It would certainly enable a staff to be transferred to the North prior to the constitution of a Civil Service Committee, but it would in no way dispense with the necessity of such a body for determining claims and questions in connection with individual officers; nor would it solve the much more serious &apos; difficulties as regards finance, the Council of Ireland, and the general working of the Act, which have been pointed out above. In fact, nothing short of a detailed recasting of several of the main provisions of the Act would be sufficient to secure workable arrangements in Northern Ireland in advance of the establishment of a Government in Southern Ireland.I appreciate the embarrassing position in which Sir James Craig and his Government find themselves. He expects me to bring the facts before the Cabinet. I regret that there seems to be no way of meeting his wishes without legislation, and, pending the conference, I feel bound to. recommend to the Cabinet alternative (A) above, which, in short, means to leave things as they are at present.H. G.Irish Office, October 6, 1921.
Letter from Sir James Craig to the Chief Secretary, dated September 22, 1921.Cabin Hill, Knock, Belfast, Ulster, My dear Hamar, September 22, 1921.The situation here demands that I should communicate with you at once.  .We have had two days&apos; debate on the general position, with the result that I do not believe our people will be satisfied unless a transfer of the Services from Dublin is secured at a comparatively early date. There must be some way found to get over this difficulty. I have already thrown out the suggestion that Crown Colony government should be put into force, and I now put forward the further suggestion that instead of waiting until 1. Negotiations break down altogether,2. A conference if held comes to some agreement,Sir John Anderson, or anyone else you like to name, should be permitted to function under section 72 of the Act. It appears to my Cabinet and myself that to do this without fuss, simply allowing the necessary Order in Council to appear, cannot be taken as a provocative action, but rather will tend to bring Sinn Fein to some definite decision which otherwise it would appear to us may never be reached. I must press, with all seriousness, this vitally important matter. We are left in mid-air. The express desire of His Majesty at the opening of Parliament is flouted and the difficulty of maintaining the confidence of the people is vastly increased by the patience we have exhibited when they believe that by a more bellicose attitude we might have secured the full functioning of the Act within a few weeks of the State opening of our local Parliament.Another point of equal urgency and importance is the situation created by the open drilling, carrying of arms, posting of sentries and bombing classes being carried out by the Sinn Feiners in the Northern Area. Over and over again representations have been made on this subject to Dublin without eliciting even the courtesy of a reply. Unless steps are taken to refunction the Special Constabulary in this area, armed with revolvers and full authority to stop these gross breaches of the truce by the other side, I fear authority will slip out of our hands and that the more advanced section of the population will take matters under their own control and thus undermine the splendid discipline of the &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; Special Constabulary.Surely the urgency of this matter must be apparent to you and the British Cabinet. How can we justify in a part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions the absolute flouting of every authority by these extreme Sinn Feiners ? I am informed that each camp is controlled by special gunmen from Cork and other places in the South, and that under the very eyes of the loyal population a regular scheme is being energetically prosecuted for pouncing upon the unoffensive population immediately Sinn Feiners believe that their organisation is perfected.Both these matters require instant attention, and failing a satisfactory reply, immediately I can find time, I will cross over to consult with you and Mr. Lloyd George.One thing is certain, that unless we are to lapse into utter chaos in the North, with consequences of far-reaching effect, a complete change of policy must take place. There is ample material here, besides courage and determination, to stand no nonsense, and there is not a member of my Cabinet or myself who will be responsible if a match is put to the powder and a massacre takes place. We would be hounded out of public life, and quite rightly so, unless we took vigorous steps to protect the lives and property of those over whom the Govern-ment and people of England have determined we shall exercise that function.Yours sincerely, _     JAMES CRAIG.Letter from Sir James Craig to the Chief Secretary, dated September 27, 1921.Prime Minister, Northern Ireland.Cabin Hill, Knock, Belfast, Ulster, My dear Hamar, September 27, 1921.Following on my two letters of the- 16th and 22nd instant, to which I have not so far received a reply, I believe there is a way out of the difficulty regarding the transfer of the various Services from Dublin.
I am advised that there is nothing in the Act to prevent a day being fixed for the transfer of all the Services. What blocks the way is the Civil Service Committee.   Let us drop the clauses relating to this Committee altogether.. Sir John Anderson has submitted to &apos;us a draft letter to be addressed to the staff in Dublin with a view to separating the Services and the Civil Servants. It is the wording of that circular that has suggested to me the feasibility of meeting the outstanding difficulty your Government are up against in establishing Crown Colony government when you still hope that negotiations will lead to a satisfactory settlement. If Sir John Anderson invites to a conference the Heads of Depart-ments here to consult with their opposite numbers in Dublin and arranges with them the terms of a circular to be addressed to the Civil Servants generally, inviting them to choose under which Government they will serve (quite freely and uninfluenced), we would be able to secure sufficient nucleus to justify our taking over the Services on an appointed day yet to be fixed.Besides meeting the real crux to which I have referred, this method would, in my opinion, be much preferable to ordering the personnel here and thei&apos;e, possibly saddling on the North men who had no desire to come and whom the North were not particularly anxious to have.The feeling here is strong that as many places as possible should be found for the 1,600 odd applicants who have filled up forms for engagement in our local Civil Service. .It is true that the effect of this procedure may be to leave Southern Ireland with rather more than its quota of Civil Servants, but surely the advantages I have outlined would more than equalise this single disadvantage which in itself could be met by refraining for a few years from making any appointments by superannuation of some of the older Civil Servants and by absorption in the British Civil Service.If in this way we had sufficient staff, and if, as my advisers hold, -there is nothing to prevent the transfer of the Services, we could go ahead without having brought into operation the Civil Service Committee, and without your Government having to function under Crown Colony government.Will you kindly give this matter your immediate consideration.I am procrastinating the business of Parliament as long as possible in order to be able to make an announcement on this subject before we break up.I fully appreciate the difficulties of the situation from your point of view, but I would be wanting in candour and in my duty to the representatives of the people here if I were to minimise the gravity of the situation. Impatience, irritation, and a want of trust is springing up owing to the consideration showm to the other side. This suggestion is, therefore, thrown out by my Cabinet and myself as a simple, safe and unprovocative method of meeting the difficulties which confront us all.Yours sincerely,JAMES CRAIG.The Right Hon. Sir Hamar Greenwood, Bart., M.P., Irish Office, London.
