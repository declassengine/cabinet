Particulars are given of the antecedents of a number of the &quot;agitators.Tho General Council of the Trade Union Congress intends to organise a national campaign to &quot;educate&quot; public opinion on the subject of unemployment.    The National Administrative Council of the unero-iioyed is organising a week&apos;s &quot;agitat ion beginning on October 10th.    There will be demonstrations to put uniform demands for higher rates of relief before the Guardians.   These demonstrations may deteriorate into riots.The Council intends to send a deputat ion to the Government at an early date.There has been a serious disturbance at Liverpool and one on a smaller scale at Sunderland: in Liverpool 162 arrests have been made and in Dundee the damage done last week is estimated to exceed  3,000.Extracts from typical speeches made to the unemployed and a list of recent demonstrations are given in an appendix to this report.The FinanoeCommittee of the Bethnal Green Borough Councl^L is recommending the Council at its meeting on September 22nd to decline to levy the L.C.C. rates as a protest against the imprisonment of the Poplar Councillors: Stepney Borough Council has resolved to take similar action.The organisers of the Poplar tenants Defence League appear to be uncertain of a unanimous response when the order to pay no rent is given, but No Rent strikes are being suggested in other London boroughs and in a few provincial towns.A summary, pf the Trade Union Congress is given.Sylvia Pankhurst has been expelled from the Communist Party of Great Britain y/ith the approval of Moscow.
THE UNEMPLOYEDEvidence ia accumulating regarding the communistactivity among the unemployed and of the inspiration of theagitators from Russian sources.     It will he remembered that inApril of this year a National Conference of Unemployedorganisations was held at the International Socialist Club,London, at which 81 delegates represented 50 committees:     as aresult of this meeting a National Administrative Council ofUnemployed was formed, of which J.W, Holt is chairman and pr. Haye secretary;   the remaining members are the organisersfor the five English areas (North, South, Bast, West and central) and the women&quot;s representative;   all are - communists.The original aims and methods were as follows&quot;l.     To organise the whole of tho unemployed for the removal of the cause of unemployment, i.a-the capitalist system, and the -substitution of a system of Workers&apos; Ownership and Control of Industry.2.     Work, or full maintenance, for the unemployed and partially unemployed workers at Trade Union rate of wage s.As a means of finding employment for the unemployed in tho trades with which they are associated, the immediate putting into operation of the Trading Agreement with Russia, and the recognition of the Soviet Government.3.     All Unemployed Committoes shall make the fullest demands of the local authorities, and Government Boards, such as will ensure full maintenance of all unemployed and their dependents.&quot;The headquarters of the unemployed are at the InternationalSocialist Club whore the London District Council of theUnemployed and the London District Council of the CommunistParty also transact their business.     The club Is entirelycontrolled by the Communist Party, which.has paid  1,000towards its upkeep,    E.W. Cant, one of the leading officials of the Communist Party, who spends practically the whole of histime at the Club, has been, appointed chief communist organiser ofthe unemployed and instructs provincial delegates on the actionto be taken at frequent secret meetings.Although/
Although the communists are responsible for and doubtless have a fairly free hand in the arrangement of organisation in this country, there is&apos;little doubt that the national Administrative&apos; Council of Unemployed is a section of the International Union of Unemployed, which has branches in France, Italy, Belgium,&apos; Switzerland and Germany:   this Union takes its orders- from Soviet Russia and Its object is to prepare the unemployed for the World Revolution. &apos;   It is clear that the method pursued at present aims at the creation of a state of financial ch^os which, it is thought, may facilitate a revolutionIn this connection it is of interest to note that the representative of the Third International in this country last winter, a man named Fachers, has been recalled and is to be replaced by Anton Beratz, a member of tho West European Secretariat, which has its seat at Worms and is controlled by tho notorious Jacques SadouU     This Secretariat, which, according to Huorteva, Director of Propaganda under the Third International, &quot;assiduously supervises the activity of; individual nuclei, furnishing them with instructions, resources and literature&quot;has decided, that Fachors&apos; concentration on the mining districts and. &quot;heavy industrials&quot; was mistaken. Instructions have, accordingly been issued for special attention to be paid to ports and, although it may be merely coincidence, that the recent disturbances have.occurred in Bristol, Dundee, Sunderland and Liverpool, there is definite evidence that the Seamen&apos;s Vigilance Committees, which are an outcome of Moscow&apos;s propaganda for a Red International of Water Transport Workers, have joined forces-with the organised unemployed committees.Further proof of the&apos;interest taken by the Third International, which is merely a synonym for the Soviet Government in the unemployed.problem, is contained in the following confidential circular:,.;&quot;CENTRAL./
&quot;CENTRAL. COMMITTEE THIRD INTERNATIONALPropaganda Department for Western Europe.To the West European Secretariat.German Section.&quot;The Secretariat of Western Europe, by neglecting the instructions of the International Central Committee whioh were quite clear with respect to this matter, is very often guilty of considerable delay in rendering the necessary assistance to all those organisations which have been founded for the purpose of bringing aid to the unemployed proletarian masses of Western Europe,   This negligence constitutes a real obstacle to the development of these organisations,&quot;The International Union of Unemployed, which is a rank-and-file organisation of the workers, intends to render material aid.to its members without any underlying motive of a political character.   It has got into touch with a certain number of political groups comprised in the Third   International, thus manifesting clearly the spirit and foresight which animates the leaders of this Union in their endeavour to tighten the bonds which unite the proletarian masses.&quot;The Secretariat of Western Europe should therefore&quot;devote all its efforts to aiding the members of this new Union.    When the Union has attained its highest degree of development it may become one of the secret ramifications of our organisation in the West and. serve as a base for the future works of the Secretariat.   This is particularly necessary at the present time because a great number of the organisations affiliated to us have changed their attitude as a result of certain intrigues of which their leaders have been guilty.     Although these organisations have not yet taken up a point of view directly and openly opposed to the Third International, they have none the less freed themselves from our sphere of influence.&quot;The work which we have undertaken in Italy, in Serbia, in Czecho--Slovakia and in France is making formidable progress. The same can be said of the new organisations which we have ::ouiiaed&quot;in England&quot;, and especially of the organisations In in Ireland,&quot;In view of all this the International Central Committee of the Third International are firmly convinced that by means of skilful manoeuvres the International Union of Unemployed will constitute In the hands of the Agency of the Secretariat of ?festern Europe an efficacious means for the complete overthrow of capitalism not only in Western Europe but throughout the entire world.&quot;Although the leaders of the Secretariat of Western Europe are sufficiently acquainted with the arguments set forth above, they have neglected to satisfy numerous demands which have reached them from the International Union of Unemployed,&quot;H&amp;ving been apprised of this fact by indirect channels, the International Central Committee finds itself confronted with the disagreeable task of having to state here that its agents have&quot;heen guilty of a gross neglect of duty.&quot;After/
&quot;After having examined the actions and conduct of the Secretariat of Western Europe, which it considers to &quot;be inadmissible and ore judicial to the task which lies before it, the International Central Committee of the Third International at its plenary meeting on March 10th, 1921, decided1.      To instruct all the sections of the Secretariat of Western Euroue to givjsutheir,,,speci al attention to the - creation and development of all sorts of organisations affiliated to theTnternat ionai&quot;Union of ^Unemploye^^2 *           ender these organi satlgna ^material as si st an ce by employing7?,pr,, ,tb-is &quot;purpose, Jibe sgeoial ,iu&quot;n3.s wB&quot;lc&apos;E the Secretariat &quot;has at its -dis-posal?.addition     ^theae.....funds,&quot;ElM^3^^1^^secret^^-9$.^ ^^^WIMf^M.^. ^ 9yj^W^ ,; ibe&quot;j^icid at the ;disposaliof,&apos;^l&apos;he-^^axio^ja^aj^a^^oj^^ the Secretariat through the agency of . the competent.....authorities r,: ,3.

Meanwhile, the National Executive Council, which intends to send a deputation to tho Government at an early date, hasordered that processions of unemployed shall parade the streets of every town and city at least once a week.Provincial oomnittees are acting on this advice as is shown by the list of demonstrations which is given in thoappendix:   in several eases they are also agitating for thefree use of halls and exchanging ideas through the medium of &quot;Out of Work&quot;, the scurrilous organ of the London DistrictCouncil, which claims a fortnightly circulation of 14,000.The Sheffield secretary wrote in the currect issue:&quot;Maintain a hellish long memory for your enemies, and the day will surely dawn when we shall reckon with the opposing forces for all past injuries, etc.   Become a general nuisance, if you cannot&quot; get a hall, by getting on the streets In your hundreds, and congregating in the libraries and other places.   Don&quot;t stay at home and starve quietly.&quot;Mrs. jhrjng is;the editor of &quot;Out of work&quot;.&apos;   She is a russian Jewess, naturalised in England, whose husband was in the Public Service and was murdered by Egyptians in 1912:   her Government pension was stopped owing to&quot; her activities in the Women&apos;s Suffrage movement.   She is a member of the Communist Party, the Industrial Workers of the v. or Id and other revolutionary organisations end was one of the&apos;leaders in the house-seizing oampaign last winter-.    Mrs. &apos;Taring took an active part in the Islington riot in January, 1921, when she suggested;  burning down the Town Hall and claimed that theincendiary mixture, found on the half-caste Gilmour, was made in her rooms.    On September 1st she took an active part in the &quot;si^e&quot; of the Woolwich Guardians. In private Mrs.,Thring advocates sabotage:   she frequents the International Socialist Club and Is a woman of loose habits.Closely associated with, Mrs. Thring, as ringleaders of the organised unemployed, are Hannington, Haye, Holt, Jenaett and Squair...v.r. Harming ton is organiser for the London District Council &apos;of unemployed and has latterly been active in most London boroughs.   In May, 1921, he was elected to the London District Council of the Red Trade Union International. .: He is an avowed revolutionary and has been very active among the London, unemployed, recently.P. Haye was a member&apos;of the London Workers&apos; Committee anu*Hands off Russia Committee and took a prominent part in revolutionary movements in 1919:   last winter heassociated/
wm    6   &quot;*associated himself1-with&apos; the unemployed movement and was elected secretary of the national Administrative Council in April, 1921.. -; He&apos; organised the unemployed march to Brighton in June last, is vice-chairman of the Soho branch of the Communist Party and in&apos;July was nominated for a seat on the National Executive of that body.J.W. Holt is ohairman,of the National Administrative.Council and London District Council of Unemployed and&apos;was in charge of the Tottenham contingent In the unemployed march to Whitehall on 30.6.21.   He has advocated the adoption of &quot;forcing tactics&quot; by the London unemployed.3). Jennet t was concerned In a riot of discharged soldiers and sailors, who endeavoured to gain admittance to the House of Commons,on ,26,5.19;   ,he boasted of throwing wood paving blocks at the police on this occasion.     He was charged at Westminster with obstruction but did not appear owing to Illness*     Jennett appears to have served In the Army and deserted a^d wag ,active In the Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos;, and Alrmen&apos;s Union in 1919.     He took part In the raid on the Public Library, Islington,, in November, 1920, and was subsequently fined 40/- for obstruction. In Deoember, 1920, Jennett organised the raid on the Islington Town Hall which culminated.in a riot.     He is a member of the London Distriot Council of Unemployed, has advocated sabotage In London and in April, 1921, taught the Leioester unemployed how to throw the police in case of a baton charge.     He is now active among the London unemployed.   There are various convictions against him in Leicester fer minor offences.A. Squair Is a member of the industrial Workers of the World, chairman of the International Socialist Club, a member of the Communist Party and of the London Workers1 Committee, He&quot;negotiated the deal when the Communist Party paid  1,000 and took over the International Socialist Club, Squair frequontly addresses unemployed meetings in London and was one of the leaders of a deputation to the Shoreditch Guardians on 31,8.21.     On 7,9.21, he visited the Shoreditch relieving officer in oonneotion with the unemployed.   He is not a believer in constitutional methods.Although the Communist Party: dominates the. N&amp;tionalExecutive Council and the London District Council ofUnemployed it is leaving no loop-hole in other directions and,as a result of a secret committee meeting held in theInternational Socialist Club on September 5th, has issuedthe following confidential instructions to the provinces:&quot;1.&apos;   All members of the Communist Party, who are unemployed, are to actively associate themselves with the unemployed organisations in their localities. Every committee seat and every official position mus\t be held by a.reliable Communist, in order that the L.D.C. as the unemployed may also contain a reliable .,&apos;,&apos;, communist majority.
2. No attempt must be made by any member of the the Party with the unemployed agitation, to disguise the fact that he is a member of the Communist Party. Every endeavour should be made to convince the unemployed that our Party is a Party of action, the only Party to whom they can look for any effective work.

3. No attempt must be made to make any local unemployed organization a doctrinaire body, having as its objects such things as the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. If the unemployed understand and desire the Dictatorship of the Proletariat their place is inside the Communist Party. If they do not understand and desire it then it is no good making that the ostensible object of their organization. Every effort should be made to make the unemployed movement a broad mass movement which will unite every section of the working class on the basis of the slogan "Work and Maintenance" and it will look to the Communist Party as its natural leaders.

These instructions have been obeyed with the result that, apart from very few exceptions, communists dominate provincial committees; the situation in the various towns differs only on the degree of organization. It is universally true that the genuine unemployed wish to adhere to constitutional measures, but their natural desire to avoid privation is exploited by agitators. Liverpool constitutes an illustration of events which are liable to occur in any large industrial centre. The number of unemployed exceeds 22,000, and the Finance Committee of the Corporation is making arrangements by means of which work will shortly be provided for 500 men who will be given two to six days&apos; work per week according to their needs. The organization of the unemployed crystallised on September 4th, when ex-Police Sergeant Robert Tissyman urged a meeting of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers to demonstrate at a meeting of the City Council on September 7th: daily meetings followed, organized by the Seamen&apos;s Vigilance Committee and other extremists with the Rev. J. Vint Laughland, Braddock, and Breslow, members of the Industrial/
tm   Q   mIndustrial Workers- of tho World and tho other revolutionary organizations well to the foro. Tho demonstration on September 7th was dealt with in my last report and it was subsequently decided to organize daily marches through the hotter parts of.tho town, In ordor to impress the &quot;ruling classes&quot;; it was also resolved to demand the uso of St.Georgcfe,Hall for meetings,*On September 10th an unemployment committee was elected^ five of the seven members being avowed communists. On Soptembor 11th inflammatory speeches wore delivered by Meahan, who is tho Committee&apos;s link with tho National Executive Council and Meld, of the Vigilance Committee, but their remarks were repudiated by Tissyman, who supports laughland in the contention that orderly demonstrations which impede traffic and are a nuisance are more effective than violence or theft.     On Soptembor 12th a demonstration of over 5,000 on St. Goorgo&apos;s Platoau led to a serious riot. A rush was made for the Walkor Art Gallery and about SCO forced their way in; the police followed and closed the doors and after a free fight 153 people wero arrested. Among tho prisoners were J. Vint laughland, Tissymsn, and Mrs.Bamber, a member of the. British Bureau of the Sed Trade Union International:   the leaders were allowed bail in  50 each and the remaindor in five pounds each and all were romanded for a week when charged on September 12th with unlawfol and riotous assembly.Bev, Jo Vint laughland   is a prominent socialist speakerwh&apos;o&quot;fe&apos;aigie&apos;a. from the Wesleyan Church&apos; in 1919 owing to tho objections raised to Ma revolutionary ideas; in July 1920 he was elected Chairman of the Anti-Militatfism and Civil liberties League in Liverpool and, In the same year addressed several meetings aS . tL.3 unemployed and Irish Self-Determination Loague0 Laugh Lani bsc-jme President of the Liverpool bra;V?a of the Communist Party in January 1921 and in   Septombe was elected secretary of the Liverpool Unemployed&quot;Committee/
Committee. As the result of his activities on September 7th all the officials of his Chapel have resigned.

Resolutions have been passed by municipal authorities in many parts of the country urging the Government to deal with unemployment on a national basis and to provide financial assistance. Many of these emphasise the demoralising effect of doles and propose that work, even if uneconomic should be provided.

It is estimated that, after deducting the number of men who have participated in more than one meeting; about 85,000 unemployed have demonstrated within the last week; serious as is this total, it yet amounts to less than 6 per cent. of the wholly unemployed in this country, who total about one and a half millions. These figures indicate that although distress and extremist propaganda are gaining ground, the great majority of the unemployed are still quiescent.

POPLAR

As is usually the case when people go to prison of their own volition enthusiasm for the imprisoned councillors appears to be on the wane although the idea of a no-rent strike has gained ground in other Londo? boroughs and in a few provincial towns. The attendance at London meetings held in support of the councillors&apos; action has averaged only about 400, although between 3,000 and 4,000 attended a Trafalgar Square meeting on September 10th; a fair proportion of this audience, however, consisted of irresponsible youths, who were enjoying a holiday. The speakers included the Deputy mayor of Poplar, Key and Councillors Kelly, Watts and Edge. The resolution passed endorsed the action of the Poplar councillors, protested against their "monstrous prison treatment", demanded their instant release and "immediate consideration and/
and settlement of the issue involved".

George Lansbury, who does not appear to enjoy the prison life, has addressed a letter to Charles Key from which the following extract is taken:-

"We look to you, and to each one of our comrades, to bring pressure on the Government in every possible way, short of violence, not merely to release us, but, what is of much more importance, to secure for the workless and the poor the reforms we are in prison to accomplish".

The Tenants&apos; Defence League appears to be disappointing its promoters. The organizer, Fred Potter, said at a meeting on September llth:-

"...... if we have to declare a rent strike everyone must be in it. It is up to everyone to see that his neighbour puts a card in his window to shew that he is going to support the Council. Pickets will go round and find out the reasons in cases where people are too proud to put them up, or afraid of offending the landlord. It is up to Poplar to shew the Police or any representative of the Government who may come this way that we are united".

It is reported that the National Union of Police and Prison Officers is prepared to police Poplar should the Divisional Force be withdrawn; as, however, these men would require payment for their services the offer is not viewed favourably as a rate would have to be levied to provide the necessary money.

On September 12th an agitator named Poole stated that in a few days, probably on Saturday next, the organized unemployed of various boroughs would march through the City to Brixton prison; during the march they would deliberately hold up traffic and cause as much annoyance as possible. This statement was subsequently repeated by Conway and enthusiastically received by an audience of about 400.

THE TRADE UNION CONGRESS

The 53rd annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress was held at Cardiff from September 5th-10th inclusive;   the chair was taken by E.L.P0ULTON
( Boot      and Shoo Operatives Union) and was attondod by 023 delegates   representing 6,416,510 organized workers,   The outstanding features were the passing of the Parliamentary Committee/replaced by tho General Council and the oollapso of oommunism as a forco among tho   delegates.   Much money, propaganda and litoraturo woro oxpendod by the Communist Party and the Rod Trade Union International in their endeavour to influenoe the Congress and a special manifosto signod by Zinovioff, Losoveky and McManus, representing respectively p tho oxocutives of the Oommunist International, the Hod Trade Union International and tho Communist Party of Groat Britain, was addressed to the dologatos. This manifosto, whioh laid down the linos to bo followed by tho General Council and the Congress, was published in full in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and in the &quot;Communist&quot;, and would appear to constitute in fact, if not in namo, a broach of the Trading igreement.   Other manifostoeo on similar linos were issued and &quot;distributed by the British Bureau of tho Bed Trade Union International and tho Communist Party, but the axfcromists devoted most of their attention to &quot;intensive pormeation of the delegates,&quot;   Various meetings were held during the week but, in spite of the presonoo of &quot;star&quot; speakers such as Noah Ablott,McManus,Walton Kowbould,Pollitt, Ytettklcs and Murphy, proved a failure, tho audionco in no   oaeo ezoeoding 300,     In the Oongross itself the fieds fared even worso although thoy suoeosded in causing pandemonium on two or throe   occasions.The question of unemployment   dominated the opening stagos of the Congress and a resolution was passed urging the provision of work or adequate maintenance by&apos;    the/
the State, the relief   of ratepayers.^ronuburdens arising   fromTinemploymejrtand tho immediate summoning of Parliament and expressing the opinion that the Poplor councillors &quot;havo rondorod a real national service.&quot; In his opening address the president suggostod a shortor w&amp;king week as a solution of tho unemployment problem and endorsed a&apos;popular labour fallacy by saying that &quot;mho nation^ capacity for production has increased enormously, and the workors must reap tho benefit of this increase in tho form of a shorter working week.W The General Oounoil is to organize&quot; a national campaign to &quot;educate&quot; public opinion in regard to unemployment. The unemployed deputation, headed by John McLean, made moro improssion than was the case last year, but contributed nothing useful to tho debate;   his suggestion   of a general strike was scouted.Tho General Council   was empowered to use the whole power of Organized British Labour for the purposs of inducing the Government to furnish the necessary medical supplies, means of transport, raw material, and money credits that are so urgently.needed by the Russian people, and the Congress urged the British Government to recognise the ihiesian Government- so a3 to-make it possible to oarry cut these proposals.     A. sum of  1000 was voted to start a fund for the relief of the fhissian workers.After a somewhat lengthy debate a resolution moved by the Iron and Steel Trades Moderation, which advocated the provision of adequate machinery to settlo disputoo without strikes or, failing such settlement, to co-ordinate the whole   resources of the movement, was defeated by 5,628,050 to 981,000 votes,  ..Considerable friction arose regarding the disarmament rosoluti-? ?od the Congress demanded the
ri&amp;ht to appoint representatives to the approaching Washington Conference.

If that is tho monument they hold up to us I say, bad as is Our position &quot;God save us.from-the r&amp;medy1.&quot;- The discussion of the domestic quarrel between the National union of-Railwayman and the Amalgamated*Engineering 1&apos;nion: ended in uproar and tho carrying of the previous question. ,    *The Congress drew attention to the discrepancy botween   the index figure of the cost of living as calculated by the Ministry of labour and tho labour Party and condemned tho Government for failing to disclose the results of enquiries into profiteering,,.   The concluding session was - as stormy as the opening one owing to the mistaken policy of the scrutineers in the ballot for tho election of a General Council:   the proposals to elect a permanent chairman had previously been withdrawn by the Paraiamoiatary. Cowmilfbee in view of general opposition and, as a now ballot on the Council is to be taken,that body is unable to got immediately to work.THE C QMMUN 13T3 . ... &apos;    *&quot;Red Week&quot;, like its predooessor &quot;Famine ii/week&quot;, must be recorded as a failure;      despite the issue of tens   of thousands of leaflets and membership cards, it is doubtful.if tho party  s momberahlp has actually increased-5 per cent a   A special &quot;Rod i?oek1T mmibar of the &quot;5ommu.niat&quot; was issued. and bears traces of now   directions rowoPostgato/

Cathal O&apos;Shannon&apos;s speech at the Mansion House on the 4th in which he lauded the name and memory of Connolly, and belittled the Dail has proved very disturbing to that body. O&apos;Shannon told the Dockers that if they had to come out on strike to fight for their wages they must not remain hungry, and while there was food in the shops or in the houses of the wealthy, they were to go in and help themselves. They could rob banks and were at liberty to get what was theirs by right. They were not to mind the Dail or the British Government so long as these two continued to be Capitalists, and to sweat the workers.

The Prime Minister&apos;s reply to de Valera is reported to have caused a shock to the Dail. De Valera, Barton, Griffith, and McNeill are all in favour of going to the conference and Griffith was said to be confident that he will carry the Dail with him on Wednesday. The Left Wing of the "Republic" are equally confident that they will win the issue. It is disquieting, but it seems a fact that the younger men are all out for a refusal to meet unless they can do so free from any reservations.

It is reported that Messrs Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins, R.C.Barton, E.J.Duggan and G.Cavan Duffy have been appointed/

Thcso two aro at present engaged on a campaign to raise funds, tho short ago of which is beginning once again to bo a serious menace,and is hampering the development of some of the civil Departments of the Dail, and is of course vitally nooes3ary to the continuance of Military operations.Military preparations oontinue, and it is reported that a special emergency ordor has boon issued for all Volunteers who can drive motors to report at the different camps.There has been a slight fraoas between two oompanios of the *rish Republican Army in Dublin, when one of the oompanies composed of men of the labouring class came to blo-ws with the other, composed of mon of the usual Sinn Fein grocers and Drapers Assistants, because thero was a class distinction.Several of the &quot;soldiers&quot; had to be put under arrest.

The National Council of Unemployed are out to get a standard scale of relief. This meeting is called to organise the unemployed of Handsworth and I am here to assist in forming a Committee $r the Handsworth District.   This is a National affair, therefore it is *p to you to organiso yourselves and fall into line with those who are already organised.   Various Boards of Guardians have been receiving deputations and the reply received has been r0h, I am very sorry, we cannot do anything until we hear from the Ministry of Health1.   That reply is all tommy rot. We want the right to lire. -If the Capitalist Class refuse us the right te work then it&quot;s for us to say. *If you cannot find us &quot;work you. must maintain us till you ao.&apos;  We have come here to-night to ask you to endorse our policy.   We want your assistance and then we might get the demand we are out for until such times as we get work. We want yea to shew your solidarity.   We want to carry the National Council ef Unemployed to see the &quot;Premier, not only to make a standard scale for the unemployed, but to make the standard scale a law of the Healm.

We are determined to stand no more of it. and by your solidarity we are bound to win...&quot;New I am going to deal with the rent question.     The question of paying rent must be the farthest from the minds of the unemployed.   When the National Scheme is ad or/ted, which will be adopted if you stand solidly, you must feed your wives, children and yourselves.   You must get clothes for yourselves and whatevercis left, the landlord can hare.   No unemployed must pay rent.

September 9th, Councillor James BASSEL,of Lambeth, said atElm Park, Brixton Hill, S.W., that:Something would hare to be done.   It was no use going along qu3e tly as they were doing.     Something would have to be done.   He had mentioned the previous ovening, going to Downing Street; &quot;and if George Lansbury was not soon out of Brixton Prison, that is what they would have to do.   He did not wish to provoke any disorder, but if the timfc should come when they would have to go to Dovning Street, there would be no use in their announcing the matter for the information of the Police.   They would simply announce that a march was going &quot;to be heM, and their followers would be under sealed orders, and leave the authorities wondering as to where they were going.September 9th, W. POOLS, at Bromloy Public Hall, Bow:&quot;Ho damned man will find me a job, whilst I am your accredited leader.    When I want a job I will find one for myself without any one else getting it for-me, and while I em unemployed I shall remain your leader.

There are no leaders, you alone are the leaders, and we are your adrlsers.   The work of the Committee will be to &quot;link up with the Vigilance Committee in other large towns, then those Committees will link up into a national movement, and the national committee will link up with committees in other countries until there is one solid international movement... There will be trouble sooner or later.   It is, inevitable, and then you will be shot down by your own olass, the workers, for you hare sons er relatives soldiers or navy men or policeman.     I want to tell you right here and now that you must write to them and tell them that when the day comes when they are ordered to fire, and come that day will very Boon, they must turn their guns and shoot in the right direction.   You must be prepared for that day when the workers will take over the means of production and force tr* capitalist class to become workers also.&quot;September 11th, NIELD, at Islington Square, Liverpool: (samemeeting as above)&quot;I have heard the last speaker and I believe him. Members of this Committee are too fond of using the rno violenoe1 call.   I say, if you are hungry, tako what you want.   We have walked round the streets sinoe last Wednesday, and where are we?   Nowhere and no better off than when we started.   Are we to walk round for another week on a If bob dole?   What use will it be if they give us  3 a week, -for who will pay it.   It will be the workers who are employed who will have to pay it in taxes and then the capitalist class will &quot;nut up the urices until both emplovedand/
and unemployed will be in a starving condition.   The blood, suokera will lot us &quot;walk round until we o&amp;n stand no longer and we will have lost the game.   Are you content to walk round all the time?   Very well then if you want things, you*ll have to take action to get them and I for one will take whatever action I think fit&quot;. &apos; &apos;September 12th9 LYLE, at Battersea:xjyla attacked Comrade Holmes, Vioe-Chairman of the Batterssa Unemployed Committee, who ho alleged lot-him down on the occasion of the march to &apos; Fulhara cn        . September 9th,   Lyle said that he was in charge of the&quot; unemployed contingent from Battersea and not Holmes.   When ho arrived outside the Fulham Board of Guardians1 Offices he had absolute&apos;control of the situation.   The polioe were small in number, powerless, and he could have done as he pleased.     He saw to that;   he had placed his men to form barriers and thus prevent      any interference by police. Had it not been for Holmes calling the men and women together and marching them back to Battersoa. whilst he was with Hanson in the Pulham Board of Guardians4 Offices, they might have taken up a threatenong attitude and forced the Guardians to grant the men^B demands.September 12th (evening) LlIiE, Church Road, Tooting:lyle said that be intended to organise the unemployed of London and march to the West End to briig home to the aristocracy what labour can do.     It was no use marching round the suburbs of London, because if they want to pillage thoy must go where those commodities were in abundance.   He did not tell them to pillage but if the worBt came that was the only thing for them to resoot to.EOhliSS, of the Communist Party, at the same meeting said that he hoped these route marches would produce suffioient recruits to form a Red Army to take charge of tbe situation when the time came.   The workers in Russia had led the way and the British workers intended to follow in their footsteps.September 13th MCQUIGGAH at Liverpool:&quot;There will be an attempt to hold a meeting to-day at 2 p.m. at St. George*s Hall Plateau, and you saw what happened yesterday.     I want you all to come to-day, and donxt come with your hands in your pockets.   Show your backbone.   These are no good (holding up his hands). Jack Johnson may be able to fight with these, but you oanH.     They are no good against armed men.   Bring something in your hands or in your pockets, and if it Is going to be a fight with the Police I will be with you, I don&apos;t want to keep you here all day.   I want to go to the mooting thi3 afternoon, and I hare something to do In the meantime end that is to put something in my pocket,&quot;
