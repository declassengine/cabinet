[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]&apos; &quot;Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1921.SECRET.CP. 3345.&apos; THE UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I RECOGNISE how difficult it has been for the Cabinet to pursue a consistent course through the many disturbing, changing and obscure events and influences of the last two years. At the same time,&apos;the fluctuations of our policy are becoming both violent and rapid. These repeated changes, which arise from our not having reached a clear view on fundamental facts and principles of finance and trade, undoubtedly aggravate our difficulties and impair our credentials.For instance, in the early part of this year most determined efforts were made to accelerate and increase the building of houses all over the country in response to the undoubted housing shortage. This continued up till about April this year. The summer witnessed the growth of the anti-waste agitation, engineered chiefly by Lord Rothermere and- supported by the Northcliffe press, with the result that by August we had cast aside our housing policy and were vehemently devoting ourselves to &quot; anti-waste.&quot; Building operations were everywhere curtailed and new -ones prevented. Preparatory work for useful and necessary dwellings was arrested. Local authorities who in the preceding quarter had been lashed to the utmost exertions were now whipped off and ordered to shut down with the greatest promptitude. This was done in the face of the fact that it was known that unemployment during the winter must be of the most serious character. Now a new crisis is upon us, and these already twice-whipped local authorities are to be whipped a third time into starting relief works probably much inferior in economic utility to the housing schemes on which they were previously engaged and to which much thought had been directed. This sort of thing undoubtedly weakens our credit with the local authorities. They begin to think we do not know our own minds, and that our course is influenced by &quot;any gust of opinion or swirl of difficulty.The problem of unemployment now before us deserves to be treated on some basis of general principle which for good or ill we can expound and defend when we meet our constituents. It is not possible for a civilised State with a large portion of its members living in luxury and the great bulk of its members living in comfort to leave a proportion of its citizens with neither work nor maintenance. No doubt the standard of maintenance must vary with the resources of the State, and in hard times it must be reduced to the absolute minimum so as to encourage and, indeed, compel the most earnest efforts to seek economic employment. But we must have some answer to give in regard to every class of workpeople who are affected by the present trade depression. In answer to the question, which can be posed by hundreds of thousands of men to-day : &quot; What am I to do ?&quot; we must have an absolutely clear-cut reply. It may not be popular, but it must be comprehensive, and it must be complete. We cannot say, for instance : &quot; You had better starve.&quot; We cannot say : &quot; You had better go to the wOrkhouse &quot; : the workhouses could Hot hold a tenth part of the numbers affected.It seems clear from the discussions we have had at Gairloch and on the Unemployed Committee that the subject divides itself at the present time into five categories: (1.) Treatment of destitution before the new benefits of the Insurance Act are again available.(2.) Treatment of destitution through the Unemployment Insurance Act whenbenefits are again forthcoming. (3.) Provision of definite relief works of a quasi-economic character to minimisereliance on doles.[6990]
(4.) Measures to stimulate the general trade of the country by promoting the. placing of orders with existing industries. (5.) And incomparably the most important the general financial policy of the country in relation to values and credit.I venture to make a few remarks about each of these. As to (1), it is far better to rely upon Unemployment Insurance than upon Parish relief to able-bodied unemployed. Until the Insurance Act is again at work we are bound to rely on outdoor relief of able-bodied unemployed by doles given through the agency of the local authorities. In England, except in the necessitous parts of London, this is on the whole being met. In Scotland a very grievous situation has arisen in particular localities. Owing to the stringency of the Scottish law the Scottish Office has urged the local authorities to take illegal action to meet these cases. They are reluctantly taking it. They may at any moment suspend action, and their case for reimbursement by the Government is&apos; a very strong one. To regularise this position, two things are necessary : (a) an immediate declaration that we will pass an Act of Indemnity legalising what has been done; and (b) a precise definition of the circumstances in which national aid will be granted to the local authorities particularly affected. This definition should clearly relate to the proportion of expenditure on poor law relief (in accordance with approved scales) to the rateable value of the district affected. A carefully drawn definition of this kind would be found to protect the Exchequer from the opening of the sluice gates, while at the same time meeting the practical need which is highly localised.I trust that soup kitchens and other forms of relief in kind will not be neglected in this sphere. Private charity may be more readily enlisted in such endeavours than in subscriptions for doles.I am very doubtful about the provision of relief works, especially those set on foot in a hurry. They concentrate large masses of unemployed men violently discontented with the wages they receive. If trade union rates are paid,and economic results are almost entirely wiped out, the work done is of the lowest order, and of the least efficient character. They do not provide for women or for many classes of unemployed men. Nevertheless, it is inevitable that relief works must be a feature-Of our treatment of the present problem. It would seem, however, that they should be confined (a) to a revival of schemes already thought out in connection with the housing policy; (b) to a continuance of road making; and (c) to a continuance of the Lord St. DavicTs schemes. Apart from the above, I deprecate entirely the starting of large new relief works.All the above methods, whether local relief, national insurance or relief works, however they may be viewed, are mere palliatives to which we are forced by the emergency, but on which we cannot rely to stem the evil. When we leave this we enter a much wider and still more difficult field. It is, however, obviously far better to get the existing industries to resume their activity than it is to start new uneconomic enterprises. It is now suggested that the export credit scheme originally devised to help the bankrupt countries of Europe should be applied to any likely trading country and made to work effectually. It is suggested that the Treasury should assist the Colonial Office to increase the loans they propose to issue in the near future for the development of the various Crown Colonies. It is suggested, though this is more questionable, that special assistance should be given to public utility companies to undertake developments which they have in view, but which they are holding up owing to the present unsatisfactory financial situation. All these three methods deserve prompt and searching examination by small sub-committees, who should be instructed to present definite tabularised schemes for action showing as far as possible the remedial effect that would be produced upon the national industry in each case, and how far those effects can be made operative in the parts of the country and in the particular industries most affected. I consider we are bound to reject as fatal to the economic future of our industry the paying of subsidies, either in cash or credit, to ordinary private firms. Once you began there would be no end to this.But the last and greatest of all the parts of this subject is the view which is taken by the Treasury of the principles which should govern our financial conduct. I confess myself at the present time without information on this matter. Is our policy to pay off our debt as quickly as possible, thus diminishing the public burden by the direct exertions of the taxpayer ? Is our policy to inflate within certain limits the national credit so as to secure cheaper money and encourage a resumption
of enterprise? Should our policy remain the austere bankers&apos; policy which it has been since the banks got the traders in their power after the short post-war boom ? Is our policy to pay off the (internal) National Debt at something like its present value in relation to pre-war standards, or is it to bring it up gradually to its full face value of 7,000,000,000Z ? Are the interests of the State in ,the next year, next two years, or next three years best served by a fall in prices or by a rise in, prices, and within what limits in each case&apos;.It is perfectly clear that the process of deflation which the Government has pursued since the middle of 1919 has had whatever salutary effects were then expected from it. Nominal values have been beaten down. Enormous masses of capital have been written off. A sensible contraction has taken place in luxury spending. On the other hand, labour has also made its contribution,*willingly or perforce; great reductions of wages have been enforced upon workpeople. The distress in the country has induced a more reasonable spirit and a more efficient action upon those who are employed. There is no doubt that our industry has been approaching a more solid economic foundation than existed before. But as the price of this twelve hundred thousand unemployed persons are now upon our hands, the bulk of whom will certainly have to be carried through the winter.It seems to me that these very grave questions ought to be resolved by the Finance Committee of the Cabinet. They have been entrusted by the Cabinet for the last two years with the practically uncontrolled guidance of policy in this sphere. They ought shortly to be in a position to give us clear guidance upon this great subject, and in particular to formulate definite opinions upon the class of questions which,! have set out above.With regard to our external debts, to international debts, and to reparations, there can surely be no doubt of the direction in which we should strive to go. But here we are not free agents, nor have we the power to decide. We only have the power to discover and declare a policy and to labour though every channel of diplomacy, finance and trade to secure the concurrence of other Powers in^that policy.w. s. c.September 28, 1921.
