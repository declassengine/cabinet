l. Benes, the representative at the League ox Nations of 02echo--Slovakia, and. its Minister for foreign Affairs, asked me for an interview yesterday in order that he might explain: his-. views upon the question of. Upper Silesia.   His title to offer an opinion teas based on the importance to his country of a stable condition of things in the neighbouring areas of Germany,;and Poland*.    He .also claimed to have special knowledge of the - condition of things.prevailing in that part of Europe.He was himself in -favour neither -of the French nor of the .mglo-Italian solution.-   As regards the latter, he thought that, it did not sufficiently &quot;recognise, the-recent and:&quot;&apos;adventitious -character of-fl-ermaa -penetration into the Polish speaking &quot;area.   He &quot;clearly had in &apos;his mind, a similar&quot; &quot; German penetration into Bohemia, which, for-a certain, period,&apos; had&apos;made even the capital of that country a German-town. Fortunately for Czecho-Slovakia this condition of;things--had been remedied before the great war-, and- the towns which&apos; were historically Bohemian had again become Bohemian in fact, - He fully recognised, however, that the Treaty of Versailles must he carried.- out&apos;;-and that even if the plebiscite -gave an erroneous idea of the permanent racial distribution in the district, it must be accepted as the only true test..this view is, however, that in drawing the frontier the results of the plebiscite might be accepted in a far greater degree than Was contemplated either by the French experts, or the Anglo-Italian experts.     These experts, differing in everything else, held that the industrial area was indivisible, - the French thinking it ought
to go to Poland, the Anglo-Italians thinking that it ought to go to Germany.     .M, Benes thought that it should be divided, - tho division, of courso, following as near as possible tho ethnographic line as indicated by the plebiscite.The obvious objection to this course, and tho ono which has hitherto boon thought conclusive, is that the division of the industrial area was thought to carry with it the des-truction of its industrial efficiency.     Power stations would ho severed from the factories which they suppliad;    tho elect-trical system would be shattered;., raw metorial. would be rained on one si do of tho frontier in order to be used on the other; tho railway system would have to bo remodelled;    and the pressing problem of water supply would t&amp; difficult of solution.; M. Benos did not dony that these considerations had weight;   but he was confident that their weight was easily exaggerated.     He based his opinion upon his own experience In the Toschen district.     The.frontier problem in that region was very similar to that whioh had to he dealt with in Upper Silesia.     In both cases there was an industrial region which In its growth had come to include areas which differedin both the frontier which bost^divided tho races, was incom-patiblo with the frontier which &quot;best suited the industries. It was the ethnographical frontier rather than the Indus-trial frontier for which M. Behas had pressed, andvhich was ultimately obtained.     He had always calculated that., if the affair was managed witn-tact and.judgment, industry would he able to fit itself to the now conditions.     Some loss thero would i lie v it ably be,;   much friction would probably bo experienced at/racial
the beginning of the now system;   but sheer necessity would soon foroe tho opposing interests to corny tc an understanding;   and tho understanding would not proves to do so difficult as might at first bs anticipated.In answer to some questions of mine M.Bones fagaih founding himself, if I remember rightly, upon the Taschen experience) thought that there ought to he provisions for securing to the German capitalists, whose works were situated on the Polish side of the new frontier, immunity from expropriation for (say) 86 years. Other precautions might doubtless have to be taken to safe-guard, the interests of minorities;   but he   did not seem to think that arrangements of this character ware outside practical politics.This, I think, was the substance of M.Benos&apos; contention. I   oleo-rly gatberud from him that* in his judgment, either the so-called French or the so-called Anglo-Italian solution would leave behind it permanent sources of discontent; and that the only path by which final peace oould be, reachod, was one which deolinod to over-ostimate tho important but, after all, very recent effects of industrial development, and, basing itself on more fundamental considerations, left industry to readjust Itself to the new conditions.(Intd.)  .
