THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) SECRET.- CABINET.OcB.  3301* (C   (AIRELAND.MRs DE valera&apos;s REPLY DATED SEPTEMBER 1,2th, 1921 &apos;10 TH&quot;PRlME MINISTER1 S UTTER Oif SEPTEMBER 7th, 19-BTT(Reference Paper No. CcPrt)PSO).Dublin.Mansion House, September 12th 1921.Sir,We have no hesitation in declaring our willingness to enter a conference to ascertain how the association of Ireland with the Community of Nations known as the British Empire can best be rocon-ciled with Irish national aspirations.     Our readiness to contem-plate such an association was indicated in our letter of August 10th.   We have accordingly summoned Dail Eireann that we may submit to it for ratification the names of the representatives it is our intention to propose.     We hope that these representatives will find it possible to be at Inverness on the date you suggest, September 20th.In this final note we deem it our duty to reaffirm that our position is and can only be as we have defined it throughout this correspondence.     Our nation has formally declared its independence and recognises itself as a sovereign state..    It is only as t^eN representatives of that state and as its chosen guardians tha/t^we have any authority or powers to act on behalf of our people.As regards the principle of &quot;Government by consent of the governed&quot; in the very nature of things it must be the basis of any agreement that will achieve the purpose, we have at heart, thatis....
is     the final reconciliation of our nation with yours.We h^ve suggested no interpretation of that principle saveits every day interpretation - the sense for example, inwhich it was understood by the plain men and women of theworld when on January 5th 1918 you said:-&quot;The Settlement of the Hew Europe must be base! on 3ueh grounds of reason and justice as will sgive some promise of stability.   Therefore it is that we feel that government with the consent of the governed must be the b&amp;sis of any territorial settlement in this war&quot;.These words are the true answer to the criticism of ourposition which your last letter puts1 forward.   The principle was understood then to mean the right of nations that had beenannexed to Empires against their will to free themselves fromthe grappling hook.     That is the sense in which wo understandit.   In reality it is your Government, when it seeks to:\rendour ansiant nation and to partition its territory, that wouldgive to the prinoiple an interpretation that &quot;would undermine the fabric of every democratic statA and drive the civilisedworld back into tribalism&quot;.(Sgd.)
