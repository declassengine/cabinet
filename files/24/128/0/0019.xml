The status which you now claim in advance for your delegates is in effect a repudiation of that basis*I am prepared to meet your delegates, as I met you in July in the capacity of &quot;chosen spokesman&quot;, for your people to discuss the association of Ireland with the British Common-1    wealth.   My colleagues and I cannot meet them as the representa-tives of a sovereign and independent State without disloyalty on our part to the Throne and the Empire,   I must, therefore,-.
repeat that, unless the second paragraph In your letter of the 12th is withdrawn^ conference between us Is impossible.I am,Yours faithfully,(Signed) D.LLOYD GEORGE.2, Whitehall Gardens,September 19th.1921.,-2-..
