(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT *)SECRET. CABINET.CP.3329,UNEMPLOYMENT.Copy of letter from, Lord Stamfordham to the Secre t ary, Cahinet *Balmoral Castle,September  1st.1921.My dear Hankey,I do not know whether you have returned from leave, but I am writing to you because the King does not want to bother the Prime Minister with any letters whioh are not absolutely neoessary for him to receive.   At the same time His Majesty is very much troubled about the unemployment question and still more after reading Dr.MachamaralB Secret Memorandum to the Cabinet (C.P.3317) of the 17th Instant:   and, as the King hopes that the question will come before the Cabinet at an early date, he would ask you to lay before thorn either this letter or its general contents.His Majesty does not know what the Cabinet Unemployment Committee are likely to recommend:   but he does most earnestly trust that the Government will agree to some scheme by which work, and not doles, will bo supplied to the unemployed, the great majority of whom Hia Majesty understands honestly want to work..    Emergency work auch as road making, land reclamation, light railways, foraetation, although unremunerative, will nevertheless be doing some good and meet the claim of those who demand work and not charity.It is impossible tc expect people to subsist upon tho enemployment benefit of 15/- for men and 12/-for women.
108The King appeals to the GovOxntnent to meet this gravej but he believes temporary difficulty, with the same liberality as they displayed In dealing with the enormous dally cost of the War.Yours very truly,(Signed) STAMFORDS AM.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir MiHankey. GiOiBij Secretary to the Cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, 22nd September, 1921,
