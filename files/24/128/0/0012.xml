In^T^OCTJMEniCILJ^ HIS BRTTANNTCr mJ^STT^^&apos;^3^)VEramsN,r)he RE f.p. 3312.  CABINET.IRELAND.Mr, de ValeraS Reply dated September 16th-. 1921, to the Prime Ministers Telegram of 15th &apos; - September, 1921.(Reference ^aper No tO.?. 5311). THE RIGHT HON. D. LLOYD GEORGE,,Sir, 16th September, 1921.I received your telegram last night.     I am surprised that you do not see that if we on our side accepted the Conference on the basis of your letter of September 7th without making our position equally clear, Ireland&apos;s representatives would enter the Conference with their position misunderstood and the cause of Ireland&apos;s right irreparably prejudiced.     Throughout the correspondence that has taken place you have defined your Governments position.     We have defined ours.     If the positions were not so definitely opposed there would Indeed be no problem to discuss,     It should be obvious that in a case like this if there is to be any result the negotiators must meet ?/ithout prejudice and untrammelled by any conditions what-soever except those imposed by the facts as they,know them... .(Signed) EAMON de VALERA..2t Whitehall Gardens; S.W., 16th September, 1921,
