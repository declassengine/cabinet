War.I would draw attention to the accompanying report of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief upon the situation in Ireland for tho week ending 1st October, particularly to certain episodes recorded in Appendix I.     I do not understand how it was that on 25th September in Dublin packages 5 feet long hidden in hay were not searched, and how on the same date a squad of men were allowed openly to drill with a breech loading gun and shells uninterfered withoI am surprised also that on 28th Soptomber Huntington Castle was commandeered by the I8R.A. and that 50 men are accommodated there; in view of the instructions which I understand wore issued that such requisitions were to stop I do not understand why steps have not been taken for the return of Huntington Castle to its rightful owners.P.-33*77.i C RET.CABINET.(Intd, ) L.W.E*War Office, S.W.I.6th October, 1921.\
REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND POR WEEK ENDING   1st October, 1921;        ,.,1. GENERAL MILITARY SITUATION.The event of importance during the past week has been the reply by Mr. de Valera tc the Prime Minister&apos;s invitation to a Conference, on the 11th October;   that this reply was in the affirmative has given considerable satisfaction throughout the country, though it is not unmixed with a feeling of\ anxiety on the part of loyalists.     It is difficult to reconcile the ,.-acceptance of the invitation with the tone of the Speeches made by many Sinn Pein leaders throughout the country, where they . have been telling their followers that nothing but a Republic will be accepted.The I.R.A. is held up everywhere&apos;as .the organisation through which peace has been obtained, and although no one knows better than the members of the I.R.A. themselves, what their conditinn was 3 months ago, they are being gradually convinced by the boastful speeches of their leaders that the   present, peace . offer is a result of their &quot;victory&quot;.Throughout the country the I.R.A. have been collecting funds and food for the upkeep cf their organisation and their training, camps..   - Houses have been commandeered, loyalists have been forced to subscribe, boycotting of English and Ulster goods is still being carried out; and wherever possible efforts are made to induce the public to believe in the power and wisdom of Dail lireann. . .As was to be expected a Press campaign for the release of the internees has been started by the &quot;Freeman&apos;s Journal&apos;&apos; and has been energetically backed^up by the, &quot;Daily NeWs&quot;     Their contention is 4 that the retention of internees is a source bf irritation and.provocation and likely to he a cause of a breach of the &quot;truce&quot;.   It might be urged On the other hand that the possession of arms by illegal organisations such as the I.R.A.., the only object of whose existence is to fight against the British Crown, is a source of irritation and likely to cause a breach of the agreement.Luring the last week there were many rumours that there. would be an outbreak on the part of the I.R.A. in the event of the invitation of the Prime Minister being such that, in the opinion cf the leaders of Dail Bireann, it could not be accepted These rumours all pointed to the fact that no warning will be given between the breakdown of negotiations, and the actual, termination of the agreement in spite cf the arrangements, which it is understood have been made between the Prime Minister and Mr. de Valera, that a few days warning should be given.The number of cases reported of breaches of the truce is increasing rapidly - the usual list is attached to this report, but it is understood that the number reported since the 11th Jttly to the Civil Government by the Police (whose reports are more detailed than those which come to the ears of the Military Authorities) has now reached a figure considerably in excess of 500.The attached extract from the &quot;Irish Times&quot; of 4th October.
fives an account of a visit by journalists to1 one of the I.R.A. training camps1 in the neighbourhood of Dublin. Their description of this camp may be taken as     typical Of what is goitigjon all over the cduntry..      Advantage has been taken or the truce to convert the X*SUAL which was 3 months ago little mote than at disorganisod rabble into a well dls-cipHjaedr sell organised and wo 11 armed force.,     This force, according to iheir oath, exists for one purpose only, the establishment of a Republic- in Ireland,.     The question is being asked, oh all sides. &quot;How much longer is.the organiua-tion and training of a rebel Army to be allowed to continue without let. or hindrance5 under the- noses of those responsible for the maintenance, of the.

4,10.21.VISIT TO AN I.R.A.GAMP.MOUNTAIN DRILL OR PUMP.Trained Men and Recruits.March Past In the Rain.Volunteers of the Irish R epubli cm Array have been drilling in various parts of the country for a long time past, and it is obvious that there is no desire to conceal the fact.As proof of this a number of journalists on Sunday afternoon, by invitation, visited a camp not far from Dublin, while a cinematograph operator took a series of views, which will no doubt, be shown in due course in the picture houses.Twenty minutes&apos; ride in taxi-cabs brought the party into the mountainous region, where, in a couple of fields remote from the highways, some 500 young men were engaged in various military exercises.   A band played martial airs, and short, sharp words of command were heard on all sides.A field whose surface had anything but the evenness of a barrack square was not the pleasantest place for such exercises, but the men made the best of it.   A steady down-pctsr of rain emphasised the unpleasantness of the conditions.REMARKABLE SPECTACLE.The spectacle which met the view of the visitors on arriving was certainly a stirring one.   Batches of men in various parts of the ground carried out their own particular movements.   Here a company was engaged in marching and counter-marching, &quot;forming fours&quot; and so onj- there a detachment of sijnallers was being Initiated into the mysteries of the Morse codejothers were undergoing a musketry course, and a larger body showed themselves familiar with the use of the revolver.     A small knot of youths lying on the ground were &apos; being shown the mechanism of a machine gun, the parts of which were taken asunder and assembled again, while several specl-mens of automatic pistols-aome of them strange-looking weapons-were being examined and explained by an expert instructor.   At the lower end of the field stretcher-bearers were Instructed in the various essential duties of the medical corps.   In an ad-joining meadow platoons were operating in extended formation and other evolutions.After an hourfs work a sharp command from the Brigade Commandant brought all the detachments together, and a march past took place, a band playing suitable marching music. Some Important officials from &quot;G-.H.Q.&quot; were present, and the Chief of Staff (Mr.Richard Muloahy) took the salute, and afterwards, when the men were formed in a hollow square, de-llvered a short address.IRISH TIMES.
HO   PEAR   OF   ATTACK.Journalists--asked whether outposts were posted in order to advise as to an unexpected invasion, but the reply seemed to indicate that no such disturbance was apprehended.     Neither- were these warlike preparations regarded as-a breach of the truce.Only comparatively few either of the rank and file or officers wore uniform.   The vast majority --ere In civilian attire, but quite a number wore belts and bandoliers,   A few wore the ancient Irish costume.It was stated that since the truce cane into force recruiting had been quite brisk.   The training takes place several times weekly, Sundays included.The recruits on parade for the nost part reside within.a radius.of eight or nine miles of- the training ground, but sone had to travel as much as twelve or fourteen miles.The Brigade Commandant -^is particularly proud of his medical detachment, which&quot; he said,, had proved Itself &quot;in action&quot; to be quite equal to.the best;of its class.CHIEF OP STAFFrS SPEECH.-Addressing the 6th Battalion of the Irish Republican Army at an Inspection on the Dublin mountains on Sunday (says the press Association), *&apos;Ir.Richard Mulcahy, Chief of Staff, said that the army was In rapid training for war. The Government was negotiating.for peace, but the enemy 1 still had his foot on their throats.     The I.R.A. was a fabric which would never be broken.
