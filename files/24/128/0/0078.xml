The London Labour Mayors having failed to arrive at asiy settlement after their return from Gairltfehi, Mr* Harry Gosling was requested by tha Minister of Health to see. whether any action was possible, tending towards the release of the Poplar Councillors, as part of a temporary settlement of the difficulties which have arisen, pending the findings of the Royal Commission on the government of London.     Such a settlement Is extremely desirable In view of the fact that the Councils of other pooi&quot; boroughs are threatening .to follow the example of Poplar and in one case have determined to do ao*The Poplar Councillors have taken up the position, (1) that they could not usefully attend any conference while remaining In prison and therefore could not be parties to any arrangement for their temporary release to attend a conference, (2) that they are ready to put in an affidavit apologising for their contempt of court, praying for release in order to enter Into a conference to be arranged by the Minister of Health to arrive at a settlement of the difficulties, and offering hearty co-operation in arriving at such a settlement4     It is understood that this affidavit is being put in today.     It has been ascertained that the London County Council would not object to release, and there is reason to believe that the other authorities in respect of whose precepts Poplar has defaulted would take the same line.The general terms on whioh it is proposed to negotiate a/
a settlement are ae follows:-(1)   any arrangement to be expressed as temporary pending the report of the Royal Commission on the govern-ment of London j(2)   arrangements to be made, by legislation if necessary, whereby Poplar can borrow enough money to pay the arrears of precepted rates and thereby   spread the levying of the necessary rate to cover those arrears over a period of say two years (if the whole arrears and the current precepted rates are to be levied In the next quarter.
