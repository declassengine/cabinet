- \(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET. CABINET . j *XPC *P * 331S *IRELAND .THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;&amp; REPLY DATED SEPTEMBER 17th. 1921. (Reference - Paper N0.C.P. 3312.)Gairloch,September 17th, 1921.Sir,I have received the oommuriication which you telegraphed to me last night * ,-.It is idle to say that a conference in which we had already met your delegates as representatives of an-independent and sovereign State would be a conference &quot;without prejudice&quot;. TO receive them as such would constitute a formal and official -recognition of Ireland&apos;s severance from the King&apos;s Domains, It would indeed entitle you, if you thought fit, io make a treaty of amity with the King, hut It would equally entitle you to make no treaty at all, to break off the conference with \ls at any period, and by a right which we ourselves had already recognised to negotiate the union of Ireland with a foreign Power.   It would also entitle yo\i, if you insisted upon another appeal to force, to claim from foreign Powers by our implicit admission the rights of lawful belligerents against the King, if we dealt with you as a sovereign and independent State we should have no right to complain of other Powers for following our example.     These would be the consequences of receiving your delegates as representatives of an independent State.     We are prepared, in the words of ray letter of the 7th, to discuss with you &quot;How the association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the British Empire can best be reconciled with Irish national aspirations.HFOR RECORD.
We cannot consent to any abandonment, however Informal, of the principle of allegiance to the King, upon which the whole fabric of the Empire and every Constl-tutioh within it are based.   It is fatal oo that principle that your delegates in the conference should be there aa the Representatives of an independent and sovereign State, While you Insist on claiming that, conference between us is impossible.I am,Yours faithfully,(Sgd) D.LLOYD GEORGE.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. September l9th.!921.
