For reasons of economy, this Report will he discontinued, after this issue.GENERAL   SURVEY  OF  THE  WEEK.The important events of the week under review have been the negotiations in the engineering and shipbuilding trades upon the question of the withdrawal of the&apos; 12J- per cent, and 1\ per cent, bonuses, and between the Scottish, Railway Companies and the Trade Unions representing their employees upon proposals which involve both wages reductions and extensions in working hours. In the latter case, the agreement effected between the Railway Companies and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen gives a promise of an early conclusion to the series of negotiations, but in the former case, a deadlock has occurred which must be overcome before the 12th October if a national dispute is to be avoided.The general situation in the printing trades appears to be more hopeful : on the other hand, the employers in the soap and candle trades preserve a firm attitude, while the workers have not yet shown any sign of weakening. Two general features of the week have been the number of proposals for increasing hours of work, and the fact that conditions, as a whole, have been more disturbed in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, than in England.The industrial situation as regards strikes actually in progress continues to be quiet,, but minor disputes are of frequent occurrence. The strike of boilermakers at Barrow, mentioned in last week&apos;s Report, and the strike of sheet metal workers at Halifax, mentioned in this Report for the 10th inst., have been settled: on the other hand, a strike of bakers has occurred at Bolton in Lancashire, and a series of spasmodic disputes have disturbed the Irish Railways.The re-assembly of Parliament on the 18th of October will be preceded by a series of demonstrations in London and the provinces at which the grievances of the unemployed will be ventilated.The Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act, and the Safeguarding of Industries Act (in respect of the protection of key industries), came into operation on the 1st October.The estimated total of the live registers of all Employment Exchanges on the 23rd September was 1,445,400 as compared with 1,479,700, the corresponding figure for the previous week.(34747-31) Wt.78-E 9 300 10/21  h.

FEATURES  OF  THE   WEEK.General Topics.Unemployment.(a) Relief of Unemployment. The Cabinet Committee on Unemployment are continuing their deliberations and are considering measures for the prevention of, as well as the immediate relief of, unemployment. No further official statements, however, have been made with regard to the conclusions of the Committee. On 22nd September, the Prime Minister interviewed the London Labour Mayors, when the Government proposals for the relief of unemployment (outlined in last week&apos;s issue of this Report) were severely criticised as inadequate, in that they would provide very little work for the unemployed and would substantially increase the expenditure of local authorities. A number of suggestions concerning work on roads and public improvement schemes were laid before the Premier together with schemes for housing, town-planning, and slum-clearances, etc. The Prime Minister replied that he would look into, the schemes at once, particularly those with reference  to housing.On 26th September a meeting of Metropolitan Members of Parliament was held at the offices of Sir William Bull, M.P., to consider unemployment in the London area. A Sub-Committee was appointed to consider and discuss certain practical suggestions which were put forward in the course of the meeting. A further meeting will- be held on 3rd October to consider the report of the Sub-Committee.(b) Labour Policy. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Executive Committee of the Labour Party issued on 22nd September, a joint manifesto on the present unemployment situation. -In this manifesto it is urged that unemployment is a national problem and that to cope with it there should be a national policy aiming at the restoration of normal industry. The proposals of the Cabinet Committee, as formulated at their meeting of 16th September, are criticised on the ground that they lay too heavy a burden upon local authorities. With regard to re-establishing normal production in industry, it is suggested that the Government should place sub-stantial orders for staple commodities with manufacturers. These orders would be placed at prices agreed after an examination of costs. Under this scheme the employers would not receive normal profit but would receive sufficient to cover cost of production, including overhead charges and a margin for contingencies. It is also stated that it may be found advisable to establish a working week of 40 hours.The allocation of the total Government order within the industry should be left to the joint decision of the employers&apos; organisations and trade unions concerned. Produc-tion under the scheme would be on Government account, and it is suggested that the Government should export certain goods on credit to Continental countries needing them. The Government might deal directly with other Governments, with co-operative societies, or with other organisations able and willing ultimately to pay for the goods.With regard to public works, it is suggested that the Government should prepare a list of schemes of necessary national work, giving preference to those which are most calculated to stimulate the revival of industry. A comprehensive housing policy is advocated as a means of extending employment in building industries and through them, in other trades. With regard to questions of finance for local schemes more assistance than is offered in the Government proposals is insisted upon ; but the distinction between revenue-producing and non-revenue producing schemes is maintained.Throughout the manifesto, emphasis is laid upon the provision of work.   If, how-. ever, employment is still not forthcoming for all workers, it is held that provision for maintenance must be made by means of unemployment insurance benefits on an adequate scale.The Joint Committee also sent to the Prime Minister a letter requesting him to receive the General Council of the Trades Union Congress and the Executive of the Labour Party to discuss the question of a national unemployment policy, and 5th October has been fixed as the date for the meeting. The Joint Committee have decided to call upon all local Labour and trade union organisations to regard Sunday, 9th October, &apos;as &quot; Unemployment Sunday&quot; and to arrange to hold public meetings in every locality in support of the demand for a national policy to deal with this problem.There have been an increasing number of demands that Parliament should be summoned at once to deal with the whole question, and on 22nd September the Joint
Committee of the Labour Party; and the Trades Union Congress sent a request to the Speaker of the House of Commons and to the Prime Minister that Parliament should be assembled at once in order that &quot; it may grant all the powers and finance required to deal with the problem.&quot; Mr. J. R. Clynes, M.P., Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, also addressed a letter to the Speaker making the same request. In his reply the Speaker stated that he was informed that, if legislation were required to deal with unemployment, no Bill could be ready before 18th October, and no useful purpose could therefore be served by summoning Parliament immediately.(c) Unemployed Organisations. The unemployed still pursue their policy of demonstrations before workhouses and of deputations to Guardians. In a few cases, as at Camden Town, disturbances have arisen, which threatened to become serious breaches of the peace. The National Administrative Council of Unemployed Organisations is to organise a series of demonstrations during the week 10th- 16th October, and it is now reported that the 13th October is the day fixed for the organisation of special &quot; monster demonstrations&quot; followed by deputations to public authorities in London and throughout the Provinces.It is reported that local branches of the Independent Labour Party have been instructed to assist in the organisation of the unemployed.Trade Boards Acts. The personnel of the departmental committee appointed by the Minister of Labour to examine the Trade Boards Acts is as follows : Viscount Cave (Chairman), Lord Weir of Eastwood, Dame Adelaide Anderson, late H.M. Chief Woman Inspector of Factories, Dame Edith Lyttelton, Messrs. James Bell, M.P., Secretary, Oldham Weavers&apos; Association, W. T. Layton, Director of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers, Sir Arthur Pease, Messrs E. L. Poulton, J.P., Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, A. Pugh, Secretary of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, and A. MacCullum Scott, M.P.The terms of reference to the committee are : &quot; To inquire into the working and effects of the Trade Boards Acts, and to report what changes, if any, are required.&quot;Industrial and Other Organisations.Association of Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees.-. A meeting of this Association was held on 20th September at which Mr. S. W. Pascall presided. On the question of compulsory powers for the enforcement of Joint Industrial Council agreements, a letter from the Ministry of Labour was considered, and it was decided to send a, deputation to the Minister representative of those Councils in favour of compulsory powers to press for further consideration of the matter. Deputations are also to be sent to those Councils, which have not yet declared their policy, with a view to recruiting their support. It was stated that 25 Councils were in favour of compulsory powers and 4 were opposed.The Secretary of the Hosiery Joint Industrial Council proposed a resolution with regard to the Unemployment Insurance Acts urging that the Association should endeavour to obtain the restoration of the power of the Minister of Labour to sanction special schemes, and it was decided to send a deputation&quot; to the Minister in support of this resolution.The Secretary of the Asbestos Joint Industrial Council raised the question of the interpretation of the rates payable under the Fair Wages Clause in relation to rates agreed upon by Joint Industrial Councils. He stated that contract work for the Admiralty had been undertaken tby a firm which was not affiliated to the Joint Industrial Cduncil and that rates of pay lower than those agreed upon by the Joint Industrial Council had- been paid. A resolution was adopted by the meeting urging the Ministry of Labour to issue an instruction to all Contracting Departments to the effect that rates of wages recom-mended by Joint Industrial Councils should be recognised for the purposes of the Fair Wages Clause. It was further agreed that the deputation to the Minister on the matter of compulsory powers should also press this question.A deputation was received from the National Confederation of Foremens&apos;, Managers&apos;, and Supervisory Workers&apos; Associations which urged that supervisory workers should be represented as such on Joint Industrial Councils.   The deputation admitted the special34747 A 2
position of these workers, and proposed therefore, that at this stage, they should be represented in a consultative and advisory capacity only. The meeting decided to advise the deputation that it was not prepared to make any recommendations, but that the question was entirely a matter for the discretion of each Council.National Maritime Board. The National Union of Ships&apos; &quot;Stewards, Cooks, Butchers and Bakers has decided to secede from the National Maritime Board, and will in future negotiate separately with the shipowners. As a result of this decision the catering department panel of the Board has for the time being ceased to exist.The action of the Union is apparently an outcome of its refusal last May to&apos; accept a reduction of wages agreed upon by the National Maritime Board as a whole.National Federation of Class Teachers. The Annual Conference of this Federation took place at Portsmouth from 22nd to 24th September. In her presidential address Miss 0. Aston drew attention to the problem of juvenile unemployment, and suggested that children should be encouraged to remain at school until they secured&apos;employment and that registration for employment should take place at the school instead of the Employment Exchange.. She advocated also the setting up of Day Continuation Schools under the Education Act, 1918, as one method of dealing with the unemployed adolescent.A resolution was adopted urging the need for a revision of the present system of educational finance, and a further resolution strongly deprecated the action of the Ministry of Labour in setting up machinery which would have the effect of recruiting candidates for the teaching profession. The fact that this has been done in conjunction with the Board of Education is not referred to.Mr. W. H. Robinson was elected Vice-President, Mr. W. B. Steer, Treasurer, and Mr. Lumby, honorary Secretary.International Textile Workers&quot;1 Congress. This Congress was continued in Paris from 21st to 28rd September. Unemployment mainly in its international aspects, was discussed both on Wednesday and Thursday and was referred to a commission for consideration. The Congress adopted unanimously a resolution drawn up by a sub-committee on hours of work, and which declared that affiliated societies should immediately combine to obtain a forty-four hour week. The resolution further declared that every worker should be entitled to holidays without loss of pay and that overtime should be permitted *only with the consent of the trade unions. A resolution was also passed inviting the international secretaries to approach the Amsterdam Federation of Trade Unions in order to secure the application of an 8 hour day.A proposal from Switzerland to give the International Committee power to call a strike in an emergency was rejected.The Guild Movement. Developments continue to take place in the Guild Movement. The Manchester and Salford Trades and Labour Council decided at a Meeting on 21st September to support the Furnishing Guild recently instituted by the trade unions in the furniture-making industry. The Guild has now- adopted a definite constitution and started a fund in order to provide finances. The lines laid down by the Building Guild will be followed and prices will be fixed on a basis of time and material used, plus a charge for the cost of administration. Mr. A. A. Purcell, of 259, Upper Brooke Street, Manchester, is acting temporarily, as Secretary.The Direct Labour Committee of the Electrical Trades Union- announces that it is prepared to tender for any kind of electrical work in any part of the country, and is hopeful that its services may be utilized in connection with schemes for relieving unemploy-ment. A contract has recently been completed for the installation of electric light at Camberwell Borough Central Library. The headquarters of the Committee are at 9, Wroxton Road, Peckham, S.E. 15.The motor bus service instituted by the United Vehicle Workers at- Folkestone is continuing and developing. The service was originally started, with four buses, in order to absorb a number of men thrown out of employment as a result of a strike. The body set up by the union to run the service is named the &quot; Co-operative Transport Society, Limited.&quot;In a speech at Manchester on 24th September, Mr. S. G. Hobson suggested that Trade Unions should enter business as life assurance and rent collecting agencies. He advocated an expansion of trade union work along lines that would give them the means, the money, and the credit, to make a real success of industrial control.
* See this Report Vol. III., No. 1, 1st January, 1921, p. 8.t i.e., the August ascertainment which fixed the sliding scale percentage at 45 per cent, (plus 35 per cent, consolidation in base rates), to operate until the end of October.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Engineering and Shipbuilding Workers (National). A crisis has developed in the engineering and shipbuilding trades, in the negotiations on the question of the withdrawal of the Ministry of Munitions bonuses of 12J per cent, for time workers and 1\ per cent, for piece workers.A conference between employers and workmen in the engineering trades was opened at Caxton Hall, Westminster, on the 21st September to discuss the question. The unions represented were the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, the Amalga-mated Engineering Union, the Foundry Workers, and.the National Federation of General Workers. The employers claimed that the bonus automatically ceased with the official termination of the war, and further advocated the a withdrawal of the grant on the ground of the depressed state of trade and the necessity for reducing costs of production.The unions&apos; representatives contended that as the bonus was granted to meet the high cost of living, the reduction in wages involved in its abolition was not justified by existing conditions. They also pointed out that in certain trades the war bonus had been consolidated into standard wages. They therefore suggested an inquiry into the position and prospects of the industry.This offer was refused by the employers, who proposed to the men&apos;s negotiating committee that the reduction should be carried through in three stages, the process to be completed on 12th December. This was rejected by a. delegate conference of the unions, and proposals for a cost of living scale and reference of the case to-arbitration were suggested to the employers, to be in their turn rejected.On the 23rd September the negotiations ended in a deadlock. Sir Allan Smith, for the employers, demanded that the delegate conference should decide immediately to recommend the graduated wages reduction and stated that, in the event of a refusal to do this the full reductions would be put into operation forthwith. The delegates decided that they were unable to comply with this demand, but undertook to ballot their members on the employers&apos; proposal.On the same day a conference was held between the unions and the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation. The negotiations took a similar course, and it was finally announced that, unless the employers&apos; terms-were accepted, a lock-out of both engineers and shipbuilders would begin on the 12th October.Representatives of the workers in both trades interviewed the Minister of Labour on the 26th September and requested him to exercise his powers under Part II of the Industrial Courts Act with a view to effecting a settlement of the dispute.The Minister undertook to give the matter consideration and to communicate his decision.Tinplate Workers (Wales). The Joint Industrial Council of the Welsh Tinplate Trade met on Friday last, on a special application from the workmen&apos;s side, to consider proposals for the revision of the Sliding Scale Agreements The workers&apos; side submitted the following resolution : &quot; That in view of the impossible position created by the price of steel bars, we ask that the sliding scale shall be suspended at the point reached by the May ascertainment, namely, 85 per cent., till such time as the price of steel bars more accurately reflects the general cost of living, or until such time that the agreement lapses.&quot;The employers&apos; reply was as follows : &quot; The employers have very carefully considered the resolution handed to them, and must definitely state that they are unanimously agreed that the Sliding Scale Agreement cannot be altered. When the sliding scale was agreed to, there was no mention of the cost of living. Those employers whose mills are working, are all doing so at a loss, and in some cases have restarted partially, so as to give some work to their employees, and if extra wages were agreed to, it would be so much increasing the cost, that there would be a total stoppage of the trade.- We feel that all should do all they can to cheapen the cost of tinplates, and it would be unwise to add to the cost, and thus increase the number of unemployed. We would point out that as soon as the last ascertainment]&quot; was arrived at and wages reduced, the percentage of mills working increased from about 14 per cent, to nearly 50 per cent, of the trade.&quot;The workmen&apos;s representative suggested that in view of the possibility of a serious reduction on the next ascertainment, the employers should consider whether or not wages

The employers replied that they would be prepared at anytime after the next ascertainment to hold a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council, at the men&apos;s request, to discuss the trade position as it then existed. &apos;    .,Railwaymen (Scotland). In response to an invitation from the Scottish railwaycompanies, representatives of the National Union of Railwaymen, the Railway Clerks&apos;Association, and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, net the  general managers of the Caledonian, North British, Highland, Great North ofScotland,  and  Glasgow&apos; and  South Western  Railway  Companies in  Glasgow  on15th September.*    Detailed  proposals for the   re-adjustment  of hours  and wages were submitted on behalf of the companies, and may be summarised as follows : 1. Wages to be reduced by the increases graiited under the National Wages Board Award of June 1920 ;2. Special payment for night duty to be discontinued ;3. Junior employees not to be recognised as adults for the purposes of calculating wages before reaching 21 years of age ;4. The hours of work constituting the standard day of the several grades to be revised. An eight-hour day will be retained in first class shunting-yards and in signal-boxes where it was in operation before the war. Engine-drivers, guards, carriage and wagon examiners, some signalmen and others will work a ten-hour day ; signalmen in secondary boxes, and other grades on the Great North of Scotland and Highland Railways and at secondary stations on the other lines, will have ten hours duty spread over a twelve-hour day.5. As regards the clerical staff, proposals were made for reductions in salary varying from  5 to  20 per annum, with the establishment of a working week of 48 hours at head offices, 54 hours at intermediate stations, and 60 hours at the smaller stations.These proposals were considered by the Executive of the National Union of Railwaymen in London on 21st September, but no announcement was made of their conclusions.Mr. C. T. Cramp, industrial secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen, addressing a meeting of railwaymen at Edinburgh on the 25th September, stated that the companies had agreed, on condition that the railwaymen gave up the National Board&apos;s wages award, to withdraw their other proposals. In the event of this offer being rejected, the companies stated their intention of proceeding through the Central Wages Board, if necessary to the National Wages Board, with the whole of their original proposals. The meeting passed a resolution affirming that the proposals were unacceptable, and expressing dissatisfaction with the financial statement made by the companies as the reason for their proposed reductions. Similar meetings of members of the N.U.R. were held on the same day at the various railway centres in Scotland to discuss the companies&apos; offer.It was announced on the 28th September, that the Executive of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen had agreed to accept a wages reduction of 7/- per week for drivers, 4/- for firemen, and 2/- for cleaners, on condition that the national wages agreement, the eight-hour day, and other standard conditions are to be stabilised until June, ly23. The reductions will be made by two instalments : 5/- for drivers, 3/- for firemen, and 2/- for cleaners will be operated on 17th October, and the remainder of the reduction on 1st December. The wages reduction thus accepted is equivalent to the increases granted to these grades under the Award of the National Wages Board in June, 1920.Road Transport Workers (National). At a meeting between the National Road Transport Employers&apos; Federation and a Negotiating Committee of the National Transport Workers Federation on 21st September, the employers proposed the extension of the working week from 48 to 54 hours without any alterations on the present weekly rates of pay. The proposal was unanimously rejected by the workers&apos; side.Aerated Waters Trade Employees (England and Wales). The Aerated Waters Trade Board has issued proposals for the following reductions in the present minimum rates of wages and hours in the trade: male workers of 21 years of age and over, from 61s. per week of 47 hours to 58s. per week of 48 hours ; female workers of 18 years of age and over, from 33s. Qd. per week of 47 hours to 31s. per week of 48 hours.  &quot;
Settlements and Agreements.-Coal Miners (South Wales). The prevalent atmosphere in the South Wales coal-field at the present time is shown by two incidents of the last week.The first is the refusal of North&apos;s Navigation Collieries at Maesteg to allow the local officials of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation to conduct an examination of trade union cards at the pit head. The Glamorganshire constabulary were called in to support the company in excluding the miners&apos; officials from their premises. Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, M.P., addressed a mass meeting of miners in the district on&apos;the matter on the 22nd September, and announced the determination of the Federation to insist upon the maintenance of the &quot; show cards &quot; custom. The meeting adopted a vigorous resolution in support of what were regarded as the &quot; elementary rights &quot; of the Federation.The second incident is the difference now revealed between the South Wales owners and the Mines Department of the Board of Trade as regards the extent to which the State subsidy may be drawn upon in aid of wages in South Wales in the month of September. The settlement of the 1st July provided that the additional cost of the wages concessions included in the temporary scheme should be met by a sacrifice of profits on the part of owners and by a subsidy from the Exchequer. The subsidy was to be available during the three months of the temporary period, and in no event was it to exceed  10,01)0,000. The agreed ascertainment for the South Wales district for July showed that, under the permanent scheme, the wages of the miners for September would have been the 1915 standard rates plus 46-34 per cent. ; and it appears to have been assumed that the difference between the cost of such rates and the wages actually paid under the temporary scheme would be met out of the State subsidy. It became known in Cardiff on the 26th September, however, that the Mines Department considered that the owners were responsible for meeting during September the cost of wages at the 1915 standard plus 97*57 per cent. The value of the difference between the two calculations is reported to be  600,000. This incident seems likely to accentuate the demand that the Government should extend the period of the subsidy by a further month. The immediate effect it may have upon the employment position in South Wales seems to have been much exaggerated ; but it has caused a suspension of business at the Cardiff coal exchange, and the whole position will remain uncertain until the decision of the Government is known on the appeal, which it is expected will be made, for an extension of the period of the subsidy.Engineering and Foundry Trades (South Wales). A dispute between the Welsh Engineers&apos; and Founders&apos; Association, and the West Wales Allied Engineering Trades Committee on a claim by the employers that the wages of skilled workers should be reduced by 15s. per week and a pro rata reduction made in other cases was dealt with by the Industrial Court on the 13th September.Prior to the reference of the matter to the Court, conferences took place between the parties at which the employers&apos; claim was modified to the extent that a reduction of. 4s. should take place during August and September, and a further 4s. on and from 3rd October in the case of skilled workers with pro rata reductions in the case of other workers, and that a meeting should be held in October further to discuss the position. As this proposal was rejected the offer was withdrawn and the original claim was referred to arbitration.The employers submitted that during the war period wages were unduly increased as a result of the close connection between their industry and the South Wales tinplate industry, so that they were handicapped in having to pay a rate which was 17s. M. above that paid by competing firms in other districts. The workers&apos; representatives pointed out that the workers concerned suffered a reduction in wages in April, 1921, and argued that no further reduction could be justified, especially as there was no guarantee that the&apos; reductions proposed would have the effect of stimulating trade and increasing employment.The Court concluded that some reduction was justified and decided jthat : (1) The wages of the skilled workers concerned should be reduced by is. per week as from the beginning of the first pay period following the date of the Award, i.e., 19th September, and by a further 3s. per week as from the beginning of the first pay period following 1st November, 1921, and that the wages of other workers should be reduced in a like proportion on the same dates ;(2) In the absence of unforeseen circumstances the rates established by this decision should continue until 31st January, 1922, and that the parties should meet in conference not later than 31st December, 1921, to determine what alteration, if any, of these rates should be made after 31st January, 1922.
