September 1921.CABINET.MOPLAH  RIOTS.IX.I circulate to my colleagues the following&apos; further telegrams which have been received from the viceroy on the subject of the Moplah riots.E. S. M.26th September 1921.From Viceroy, Home Department, 20th September 1921.Pol. 719, II ome. Malabar disturbances.

Rebels : 10 killed.   Nothing further to report.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 20th September 1921.Malabar disturbances. Following military telegrams are repeated for informa-tion. First: from General Officer Commanding, Madras District, dated 16th September, 19&apos; 25 hours : &quot;Situation 18 hours. About 40 rebels arrested yesterday around Irembiliyam, Balujakunu and Parapannangadi. Columns getting into position for next mob. Telegraphic communication re-established with Ponnani. Motor patrol from Cannanore visited Irriti on Cannanore-Mercara road yesterday. Party of (? Leinsters) arrived at Nadghani from Gudalur report all quiet. Bezwada quiet. Strong guards Madras Auxiliary Force posted on Godavari and Kistna bridges, owing to persistent rumours of intended attempt to damage.&quot;Second : from Commander-in-Chief to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Command, dated 17th September : -&quot; Should the despatch of additional troops to Malabar area be necessary, you have sufficient to cope with requirements. Please keep me informed of your opinion of the situation, especially in regard to the area around Bezwada.&quot;Third : dated 18th September, in reply to Commander-in-Chief&apos;s telegram : &quot; Views on the situation will be separately sent, periodically. All probable demands for troops for Malabar or elsewhere can be met by troops in hand. At present all is quiet in Bezwada area. One company of Bedfords are there, and the main railway bridges are guarded.. The movable column from Secunderabad will, in my opinion, be able to deal adequately with any disturbances which may arise in that area. Some time may elapse before the settlement of the Malabar area can be completed, owing to difficulty of obtaining correct information of designs and movements of the rebeis, and the nature of the country to be traversed. For the present requirements, however, the military force in the area is adequate. If rein-forcement is necessitated by further developments, I can do this from within my own command. Fights in Madras City between mill (? operatives) are still source of slight trouble, but in my opinion it is not a serious matter. Throughout the rest of the Southern Command the situation is normal.&quot; 4662     100  9.21SECRET./-CP;:op/
