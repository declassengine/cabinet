British Delegation, Hotel Beau Elvage, Geneva.Mr, Spicer presents his compliments to the Secretary to the Cabinet and begs to transmit herewith, by direction of Mr. Balfour, a copy of the provisional Broods verbal of the meeting of the Council of the League of nations held on the 6th instant, and to call special attention to item -Ho. 507 dealing with the question of the despatch of a commission of three impartial persons to Albania.A copy of this communication is being sent to H.M. Ambassador at Paris.7th Ootober, 1981.
507.-    Despatch of a Commission to Albania.^MR. BAIFOtfR   read his report;.&apos;The Marquis ;* LMPER2ALI thought that :the .following paragraph: of the resolution proposed by Mr.Balf ourshould be modified&quot;The Council is of opinion that the Commission should arrive in Albania between now and the 1st November, 1921&quot;.The Assembly had decided that this commission could only begin its work after the Conference of Ambassadorshad taken a decision regarding Albanians frontiers.     It wasto be hoped that the Xtenfarenca-o ; A^by the 1st November, but should no decision have been takenby that date,, serious difficulties might arise If theCommission were sent.     Its arrival might excite public feeling, and moreover it would have to remain inactive until:the Conference of Ambassadors published its decision.MR. BALFOUR said that,, ih order to give satisfaction to the Marquis Imperiali, he proposed to draft the second paragraph of the resolution as follows!-&quot;The Council -conaiders tnat the Commission should arrive in Albania by 1st NovemberH 1921. hut that it should take no action in regard to the frontiers until the decision of the Allied and Associated Powers is given.&quot;It was essential .that the Council should mention in its? deoision a definite and. ah early datau.     The Assembly had &quot;requested the Council forthwith to appoint a Commission of three impartial persona- to proceed immediately to Albania&quot;.. The Assembly had insisted on the urgency of the question, and had clearly desired to convince the Principal Allied and Associated Powers that they were under the obligation.
to take an immediate deci&amp;ion. .   Several speakers in the   -Assembly had lai-d stress on the fact that the slowness of the Allied and Associated Powers in taking decisions hampered the Leaguers work of maintaining peace.     Tho Council, by fixing the date at the 1st November, should make it clear that it1 did not go against the declared; will of the Assembly.that the question of Albania&apos;s frontiers should be settled forthwith..      If the Council refuse to carry out the undoubted wish of the Assembly with regard to a date, and if it refused to carry it out because it foresaw the possibility that there would be another month&apos;3 delay before the Allied and Associated Powers could, settle the frontier of Albania, he thought the Council would,find that, if any difficulties occurred, either between Albania and Serbia or between Albania and Greeoe, an oxtremely bitter feeling would be aroused, in all those who belong to the League of Sations or took an interest in theLeague of Nations, or who had borne any part whatever in thewhoSecond Assembly, or/would bear any part in the Third Assembly.      He was quite sure the Counoll would make, a. great mistake if the Assembly oould say that, in inten^meeting its wishes it had weakened their expression.After an. exchange of views between-Mr.. BALPOUit,. M.. LEON. BOURGBOIS, the Marquis IMPERIAL! and M. HTi^ANS:,. Mr. Balfour*&apos;s report was adopted by the. Council with certain modifications..The Marquis IMP3RIALI declared that   he accepted the new draft proposed by Mr. BALPQUB, and amended by M.   HYMANS.
