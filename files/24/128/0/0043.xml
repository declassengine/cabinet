3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC. MAJESTY1&apos;S GOVERNMENT).RET. 0 A B IN E. T. VjA^344.          EFFECT OF WITHDEAWAL OF BRITISH. FORCES .     _FROM IRAQ.__j___Paraphrase Telegram from tho High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Dated 24th September,: 1921,.(Received Colonial Office 10.55 p,m. 26th September 1921)No.520 dated 24th September.In connection with proposals rcoently made for acoeler-atiag reduction of British forces in Iraq and tho War Office idea of withdrawing all British battalions,I thought it necessary to ascertain in confidence the personal views of advisers and senior British officials in the oountry as to effect whioh knowledge of aooeli*r*iV)d   programme and contingency of withdrawing white troops was likely to have either on Eritish personnel(who are waiting to hear terms Eis Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to offer them) on or various local communities.The result is a strong conoensus of opinion that with-drawal of all white troops is bound to have an unsettling effect on both communities.   With regard to the programme of reduction it appears that British personnel in general feel satisfied on the whole that a twelve battalion scheme will be sufficient to safeguard their interests and seourlty.     6n the other hand, having been witnesses of lamentable developments during&apos; past year in Persia and In view of future potentialities of TuruorBolshevik menaae, and of fact that peace with Turkey does not seemVany nearer, it can hardly be expected that they should olose their eyea alto-gether to remote contingency of British civilian community having to evacuate, and In this connection some doubt has been\displayed as to whether even with twelve battalions it would be possible for army to evacuato oivilian British community, whllie,. there is
a definite belief that evacuation would not be possible in the case of 8 battalions scheme and four battalions scheme.In view of the existence of this feeling, I discussed matter with General Officer Commanding ia Chief, who informs me that hitherto contingency of having to evacuate civilian British community has not entered into military calculations on which reduction programme was agreed upon.    The dispositions are simply designed to cover safe withdrawal to Basrah of military force itself.     In any case it is obviously impracticable for General Officer Commanding to formulate a scheme for evacuating British personnel without being informed whether evacuation would be made compulsory and without some details as to probable numbers to bo dealt with.   But I gather from him that with twelve battalions he considers prima facie that he could carry-out such evacuation,, and with eight British possibly, but not with four battalions.   I should say evacuation of civilian personnel was contingency which need hardly be considered if our calculations could be based on probabilities of internal situation in Iraq as a watertight compartment.   But while Turkey remains a hostile neighbour this is not a safe creed, and in view of the fact that all our deliberations at Cairo and pro-gramme resulting therefrom were based on hypothesis of a friendly Turkey I have thought it necessary to emphasise above aspeot ef situation in order that in our keen desire to effect economy and to reduce our force we may not close our eyes to fact that our calculations may be gravely vitiated by external situation.COX.2, Whitehall Gardens.
