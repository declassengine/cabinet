TRADES   UN I OH   CONGRESS - september, 1921&quot;This Congress;leafns. with satisfaction that the President of the United States is calling an International Conference to discuss the question of the Disarmament of nations with which policy it is fully in accord.In the opinion of this Congress, however, such a Conference will not be satisfactory unless Labour is ade,-* $uately represented thereon, and understanding that Great Britain will take part in such Conference, this Congress claims the right to appoint representatives of organised Labour to attend the Conference, seeing that the subject to be discussed is a matter vitally affecting the interests of the workers in all nations.The Congress further protests against the recent decision of the British. Government to carry out an oxten-slvo programme.of armaments which is contrary to the spirit and policy of disarmament arid peace, as advocated-repeatedly by members of the Government themselves.The Congress farther asks   for the suspension of all preparations for war at least until the Disarmament Conference has finished its work.
