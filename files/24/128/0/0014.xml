SURVEY  OP   THE   WEEK.The Trades Union Congress concluded its annual session at Cardiff on Saturday, the 10th inst. An account is given below of the more important proceedings during the last four days of the Congress.Taking the Conference as a whole, the two most notable debates perhaps were those on the question of armaments and on the central control of disputes. In both of these there was a real clash of reasoned opinion that was fought out in debate, instead of as is so often the case the Government, employers or some other dummy, being set up and shot at from all sides. The whole meeting, however, gave the impression that the importance of constructive thought is being more definitely realised : indirectly connected with this, the interest shown in matters connected with education was notable. The fate of the many resolutions, however, dealing with matters of domestic concern to the trade union movement, such as those regarding men in the railway workshops and the Triple Alliance, once more demonstrated the fact that Congress is not a body capable of settling difficult matters of dispute.No trade disputes of national importance are in progress at the moment, but there are indications that the last few days of the present month may be critical as regards the coal mining industry, the engineering and shipbuilding industries and the printing trades.Public attention is concentrated to a considerable degree upon the unemployment position and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress is about to conduct a national Labour Campaign in support of the policy on this subject adopted by the Congress last week. The centre-point of the campaign will apparently be a demand for the immediate termination of the Parliamentary recess. The estimated total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges on the 9th September was 1,502,600, as compared with 1,527,500, the corresponding figure for the previous week. It is estimated that some 290,000 persons have exhausted their unemployment benefit rights, for the current benefit period, which ends on the 1st November. ,(34644-31)  Wt.78  300  9/21  H.

FEATURES  OP  THE  WEEK.General Topics.Oversea Settlement. Details have now been published of the proceedings of a conference to consider the question of State-Aided Empire Settlement, held at the Colonial Office on the 29th and 31st January and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd February, 1921, between - representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and representatives of the Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and New Zealand. The object of the Conference was to formulate proposals for the settlement of this question for consideration at the conference of Prime Ministers and representatives of the United Kingdom, the Dominions and India, which was held in June, July and August, 1921. After considerable discussion certain proposals were submitted by Lt.-Col, Amery, M.P., as Chairman of the Oversea Settlement Committee, and were approved by the Conference.The following extracts from the minutes of the Conference indicate the scope of the proposals * : (1) His Majesty&apos;s Government to co-operate with the Oversea Governments in a comprehensive policy-of Empire land settlement and Empire directed migration extending over a period of years, and to this end to contribute up to a maximum of  2,000,000 a year in any year.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Government to assign normally about half its total contribution, namely  1,000,000, to land settlement. In view, however, of its commitments in respect of the free passage scheme for ex-Service men and women and other kindred expenditure arising out of the special conditions of the post-war situation the amount available for land settle-ment for the financial years 1921-2 and 1922-3 will probably not exceed  750,000.(3) His Majesty&apos;s Government to assign the balance of its contribution to assisted passages, including, if necessary, outfit and landing money allowances.(4) If the dominion would prefer in lieu of a joint contribution to assist passages, some alternative scheme for the assistance of settlers generally or for land settlement, His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider the allocation to such scheme of the amount it would otherwise have contributed to assisted passages in respect of settlers proceeding to that dominion.(5) In view of the commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government to its ex-Service men up to the end of 1922, and of the arrangements already made by other Governments for their own schemes of assisted passages, it is not contemplated that the general scheme for assisted passages referred to above should come into operation before the middle of 1922 or the beginning of 1923.The conference passed a resolution, recommending these proposals for consideration at the Conference of Prime Ministers of the Empire.A resolution was also adopted as follows :  \ &quot; That it is desirable in order to emphasise the distinction between the movement ofBritish subjects within the Empire and emigration to or immigration from foreign countries, that such expressions as &quot;oversea settlement,&apos; &apos;Empire settlement&apos; or &apos; British settlement,&apos; and &apos; oversea settlers &apos; or &apos; British settlers &apos; sb ould be used in connection with the movement of British subjects within the Empire in preference to &apos; emigration &apos; or &apos; immigration &apos; and &apos; emigrants&apos; or &apos; immigrants,&apos; these latter expressions being confined to movements to and from countries outside the Empire.&quot;At the Conference of Prime Ministers and representatives of the United Kingdom, the Dominions, and India, these proposals and resolutions were considered by a special committee under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The following resolutions were finally adopted by the conference : (1) The conference having satisfied itself that the proposals embodied in the report of the conference on State-Aided Empire Settlement are sound in principle, and that the several dominions are prepared, subject to parliamentary sanction and to the necessary financial arrangements being made to co-operate effectively with the United Kingdom for the development of schemes based on these proposals but adapted to the particular circumstances and conditions of each dominion, approves the aforesaid report. The South African representatives wish to make it clear that the limited field for white labour in South Africa will preclude co-operation by the Union Government on the lines contemplated by the other dominions.(2) The conference expresses the hope that the Government of the United Kingdom will at the earliest possible moment secure the necessary powers to enable it to carry out its part in any scheme of co-operation which may subsequently be agreed on, preferably in the form of an Act which will make clear that the policy of co-operation now adopted is intended to be permanent.(3) The conference recommends to the Governments of the several dominions that they shall consider how far the existing legislation on the subject of land settlement, soldier settlement, and immigration, may require any modification or expansion in order to secure effective co-operation, and should work out for discussion with the Government of the United Kingdom such proposals as may appear to them most practicable, and best suited to their interests and circumstances.* For the full text of the proposals and other resolutions and proceedings, see &quot; Summary of Proceedings and Documents of the Conference of Prime Ministers and Representatives of the United Kingdom, the Dominions and India held in June, July and August, 1921.&quot;   (Cmd. 1474.)
34644Considerable prominence has been given during the last few days to a detailed scheme for settlements on the Crown Lands at present undeveloped in Australia, which has been put forward by Sir Joseph Carruthers, a former premier of New South Wales. It is proposed to place 1,000,000 farmers on farms within 20 or 25 years, and it is expected that most of the farmers will be drawn from the British Isles. To enable this proposal to be carried out it is suggested that a joint British and Australian fund of  30,000,000 should be raised to be spent in the first six years, and that the construction of railways, roads and water conservation works should be put into operation at once, so that the land may be available for agriculturists at an early date.Unemployment. In view of the abnormal amount of unemployment and the conse-quent distress prevailing at the present time, a Cabinet Committee on Unemployment was set up before the beginning of the Parliamentary recess, consisting of the following-members : Sir Alfred Mond (Chairman), Sir Robert Home, Dr. Macnamara, Mr. Stanley Baldwin, Mr. Robert Munro, together with the Earl of Crawford (First Commissioner of Works), Mr. E. Hilton Young (Financial Secretary to the Treasury), and Mr. Arthur Neal (Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport).The Committee met on the 13th September and reviewed the whole position with regard to unemployment and considered reports by the Departments, including reports on special areas. Various proposals were examined as to methods of rendering financial assistance, in districts where unemployment is specially severe, to local authorities who are prepared to undertake relief schemes upon work of public utility. The Scottish Parish Councils have been circularised by the Scottish Board of Health with a view to their making provision to meet distress on the lines in force in the case of Boards of Guardians in England and Wales.In connection with the increased scales of relief proposed by various Boards of Guardians which have been submitted to the Ministry of Health for sanction, a circular was issued on 8th September to Boards of Guardians throughout the country for their guidance in dealing with this question. The circular states that relief given under the poor laws should be sufficient for the purpose of relieving distress, but that the amount of relief so given should be calculated on a lower scale than the earnings of the independent workman who is maintaining himself by his labour. Relief should not be given without full investigation of the circumstances of each applicant, and, in the cases now in question, the greater portion of relief should be given in kind. The attention of the Guardians is also drawn to the regulations allowing the granting of relief by way of loan, and the Ministry considers it desirable, wherever practicable, that this course should be adopted. The Ministry&quot; of Health has also arrived at the decision that the scale of relief suggested by the Islington Guardians of  &apos;6 IBs. 6d. a week, for a man, his wife and six children, cannot receive sanction, and the Guardians have therefore reverted to the old scale, while promising that the matter shall be further discussed. This has caused con-siderable discontent among the unemployed in the borough, and several deputations have waited on the Guardians.Deputations and demonstrations of unemployed demanding work or adequate maintenance are reported from all parts of the country, and breaches of the peace arising therefrom are reported to have taken place in several centres, the most serious being at Dundee, Bristol and Liverpool. At Bethnal Green, a meeting of representatives of London boroughs passed various resolutions which were sent to the Prime Minister with a request that he would receive a deputation from the meeting, and that Parliament should be convened at once for the purpose of dealing with the problem.A manifesto dealing with the question has been Issued by the executive committee of the London Labour Party to all Labour Mayors, party leaders, party whips, and secretaries of affiliated local trades councils and borough and divisional labour parties, which insists that the problem of unemployment is a national one, and that the Goverment should be compelled to &quot; cease its policy of shifting national burdens on to the shoulders of working and lower middle-class ratepayers in the poorer areas &quot; ; and it demands that the unemployed shall receive proper assistance out of national funds, and that machinery shall be set up to deal with the problem on the lines of the Labour Party&apos;s Prevention of Unemployment Bill. The National Administrative Council of Unemployed Organisations has decided that all local Unemployed ^ Committees shall, during the week October 10-16th, hold factory meetings and on 16th October organise mass demonstrations and arrange for deputations to wait on local authorities, while the Council itself will interview various Government officials.
It is reported that, at the national conference of the Amalgamated Engineering Union held on 2nd September a l-esolution was proposed that the Executive Council should take a ballot vote on the levying of Is. 6d. per Aveek in order to give additional benefits to those members who are unemployed, but the resolution was defeated. At the end of August there were 89,290 unemployed members of the union, representing a decrease of 13,572 from the previous month. The total membership was 438,844, showing a decrease of 5,136 from the previous month&apos;s figure.Com Production Acts (Re-peal) Act, 1921. At a meeting, held on 24th August, of the Council of the National Farmers&apos; Union; a resolution Avas adopted protesting against the action of the Government in placing this Act upon the Statute book ; but expressing the opinion that the best interests of the industry would be served by an endeavour to ensure the successful working of the local voluntary conciliation committees set up under the Act, by co-operation AAdth representatives of the employees. The Council also urged the members of the District Wages Committees appointed by the Union to accept the invita-tion extended to them by the Minister of Agriculture to become members of conciliation committees, and to take immediate steps to have such committees recognised.Safe-guarding of Industries Act, 1921. At a meeting of the executive committee of the National Joint Industrial Council of the Glass Industry, it was unanimously decided that representations should be made to the Board of Trade that, on any matter affecting the industry in connection with this Act, the Joint Industrial Council for the Industry should be the means of communication with the GoA^ei-nment. This decision was arrived at as a result of the.discussion concerning the action of the members of the flint glass section of the industry, who have already approached the Board of Trade to find out what can be done on their behalf under the Act.It was also decided that the Ararious Associations connected with the Industry should be asked to collect and collate all possible information which might be required by the Board of Trade under Section 2 of the Act.   -Industrial Organisations.Forthcoming Conferences. Several conferences of interest will be held in the near future.The annual meeting of the Labour Research Department takes place on 1st October and will consider a recommendation that the Avork of the Department shah be revised in order to avoid oA^erlapping with the new Joint Department of Research and Information to be set up by the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress. It is expected that the amiliation of trade unions to the Department will cease.The National Federation of Professional, Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Workers will meet on 17th September to determine upon the form of a questionnaire to be put before members of, and candidates for, Parliament and Municipal bodies. The meeting will consider the formation of a Standing Joint Committee to give effect to the wiews of the grades of workers covered by the Federation, it being considered that they represent a distinct third party in industry, coming between the shareholders and the manual Workers.A Delegate Conference of those unions affiliated to the N.T.W.F. which are to be amalgamated to form the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union will be held from 20tb-22nd September, further to consider the proposed constitution of the new union.Other Conferences to be held include that of the National Union of Pottery Workers on 17th September, the National Federation of Class Teachers on 22nd-24th September and the National Council of Women 27th-29th September.National Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks.-A conference of delegates of the above Union Was held in London on 11th September with the object of discussing the position of members under the Grocery Trade Board.A resolution was passed welcoming the establishment of a trade board but expressing disappointment at the delay of the Minister of Labour in confirming rates fixed by the Board. In addition the l-esolution regretted the reAdsions made by the Board when considering the objections to the rates originally fixed and considered that the last rates were quite inadequate. The resolution also pressed on the Board the urgent necessity of fixing rates for the higher grades of workers as quickly as possible.  &apos;
* See this Report, Vol. IV. No. 10.   3rd September, p. 95.National Union of Railway men. A Conference of the National Carriage and Wagon Grades Movement was held in London on the 9th and 10th September. The delegates present numbered 120 and a material strengthening of the movement was reported. The attack made by the Trade Union Congress on the cost of living index numbers was approved and it was decided to ask the N.U.R. to call a Conference to review the position of the grades represented in the movement.Trades Union Congress. The Trades Union Congress continued its proceedings on Wednesday, 7th September, when Mr. J. R. Clynes, M.P., introduced a resolution demanding specific representation of labour on the Council of the League of Nations ; and instructing the General Council to take steps to secure popular support for this policy, and to obtain the united aid of national and international labour in support of a League of Nations fully representative of the people, recognising the rights of all nations without regard to influence or power.   The resolution was carried unanimously.A delegation was received from the Belfast Expelled Workers&apos; Committee, and Congress instructed the General Council to take all steps necessary to safeguard the interests of trade unionists denied the right to work in the Belfast area.On the following day the chief resolution of interest was one welcoming the decision of the United States to call an International Conference on the question of disarmament, and claiming the right of labour to appoint representatives to that Conference. In the course of the debate Mr. Smillie drew attention to the possibility of an international miners&apos; strike in&apos; the event of another war. No decision was reached on the differences between the National Union of Railwaymen and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the debate being closed at an early stage by the passing of the previous question. The General Council was instructed to -report to Congress on the question of fixing a minimum wage for all workers, and a resolution was approved protesting against the attack made on the wages of lower paid workers and calling on the Government to set up Trade Boards in all industries where the workers demanded protection.The remainder of Thursday&apos;s session was devoted to the addresses of the fraternal delegates.On Friday considerable time was devoted to a discussion of the famine in Russia and a resolution was passed expressing the sympathy of Congress with the Russian people and authorising the General Council to start a fund for the purpose of affording financial relief. The General Council was empowered to use the whole power of organised British labour for the purpose of inducing the Government to furnish the necessary medical supplies, means of transport, raw materials and money credits and the British Government was urged to recognise the Russian Government in order to make these measures possible.An important resolution dealing with the conduct of industrial disputes was moved on behalf of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation. It pointed out the need for pro-viding adequate machinery whereby, in the event of any industrial dispute being likely to lead to a stoppage of work which would involve directly or indirectly large bodies of workers, suitable intervention might be brought to bear in order either to obtain an equitable settlement of the dispute without a stoppage of work, or, failing such a settle-ment to provide that the machinery and resources of the movement should be so applied as to secure a successful issue. The resolution was opposed by the Miners Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen and was defeated on a card vote by 5,628,000 votes to 981,000. Discussion on the resolution served however to indicate the presence of a growing body of feeling in favour of exercising stricter control over the strike weapon. Further resolutions carried demanded a 48 hour week for seamen and that procedure on the Hours of Employment Bill should be completed. The action of the Government in restricting its commitments on housing was deplored, and the scheme proposed by the trade union Education Enquiry Committee* for the provision of educa-tional facilities for adult workers was approved.The proposal of the Parliamentary Committee for a full-time paid chairman was withdrawn as it became evident in the course of a long discussion that the appointment had not the support of the meeting, and the election of members of the Council was declared void owing to a misunderstanding on the method of taking the ballot. The General Council- was therefore not constituted, and a fresh vote of the Unions is to be taken.
Apart from fairly strong indications of policy with i*egard to unemployment and to foreign affairs, the Congress did not succeed in throwing light on many outstanding problems. It showed, a marked inclination to avoid contentious issues and referred most of its resolutions to the General Council with very little indication o  how their objects were to be attained. There has been in the past a tendency to regard resolutions of the Trade Union Congress merely as expressions of opinion ; the proceedings of this Congress would appear to indicate that in future the truth of this criticism will depend to a very great extent upon the degree of activity shown by the General Council.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Plumbers (West Riding). A reduction in wages of l^d. per hour proposed by the West Riding Federation of Master Plumbers has been put into operation by the employers, notwithstanding the fact that at a conference on loth August, between representatives of the Master Plumbers&apos; Federation and the Operative Plumbers&apos; Society, no- agreement was reached.. Resentment against this action is felt by the men, but it is stated that the Area Committee, although authorised by the Executive to call a strike in the event of their deciding against the reduction, are not prepared to act on this authority. It is probable that the reduced rates will be accepted by the Area Committee at their meeting next week.Engineering and Shipbuilding Workers (National). It is anticipated that the question of the withdrawal of the 12J per cent, and 7J per cent, bonuses will be the subject of joint conferences of employers and employees in each 01 these industries, to be held in London in the near future.As regards the shipbuilding industry, the conference will be the one proposed by the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation on their withdrawal of their notice to the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades to discontinue the payment of these bonuses as from the 1st September.* This conference is to be held on the 23rd September. The conference to deal with the engineering industry will be the conference provided for in the agreement of July last, under which the advances granted in 1920 by Award 180&apos; of the Industrial Court were withdrawn. The date of this second conference is not yet known.A delegate meeting of the Amalgamated Engineering Union was held at York on the 2nd instant to determine the policy to be pursued by the union in the negotiations. It was decided to put forward as a basis of discussion the principle that no reduction should take place unless justified by a proportionate decrease in the cost of living.The Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades have invited the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Foundry Workers, the Foundry Trades&apos; Federation and the General Workers&apos; Federation to a preliminary conference next Tuesday, the 20th instant.Railway Wagon Workers (Midlands). The employers in the Railway Wagon Building and Repairing trades have notified the Joint Committee of Engineering Trade Unions, Birmingham, of their intention to deduct the 12^ per cent, and 7g- per cent, bonuses on and after 12th September. The Joint Committee has requested a conference to discuss the matter.Cotton Operatives (Oldham). A dispute is threatened between the Anchor Spinning Mill Company and their employees. A change from the production of coarse to medium counts necessitated an adaptation of certain machinery and the consequent temporary displacement of a number of operatives. The stoppage of their pay led to the tendering on their behalf of a week&apos;s notice by the Oldham Card and Blowing Room Association.The action of the Union has been brought to the notice of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, and the General Committee of the Federation have summoned a meeting of members at which they will submit a resolution pledging the members to take any action which the General Committee may recommend, &quot; if the operatives at the Anchor Spinning Mill Company do not return to work.&quot;Printers (National). It has been agreed between the Federation of Master Printers, and the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation that the employers shall suspend the posting of notices referred to in last week&apos;s Report, in order that the unions concerned may take a ballot of their members. The ballot, which is to be concluded by 27th September, will be upon a proposed initial reduction of 5s. a week to take effect on the* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 9, 27th August, 1921, p. 80.
Negotiations and Disputes continued,pay-day of the week ending 1st October.. In the event of the acceptance of these terras, the second reduction of 2s. 6d. per week will take effect on the pay-day of the week ending 7th January, 1922.Leatherworkers (National). Negotiations for wage reductions have been in progress between the Leather Producers&apos; Association, the National Leather Trades Federation, and the National Federation of General Workers. The employers&apos; proposals embodied a reduction of Id. per hour as from 1st August, and a further Id. per hour as from 1st September. The first reduction was accepted by the imions, but a ballot taken on the second showed a large majority against acceptance. The Joint Committee of the Federations, however, recommend that the workers should accept the second reduction, and it is probable that their recommendation will be adopted.Strikes and Lockouts.Tramwaymen (Saljord). As a result of the mass meeting held on the 10th instant, tramway workers employed by the Salford Corporation ceased work*on Sunday night in support of their contention that certain tramway inspectors should continue their member-ship of the United Vehicle Workers Union. An attempt by the Mayor of Salford to bring about a settlement has been unsuccessful.Settlements and Agreements.Building Trade Operatives (Peterhead District). A strike of building trade operatives was settled as the result of a conference on the 6th instant between representatives of the Peterhead Master Builders&apos; Association and the Building and Monumental Workers&apos; Association, Scotland.-A rate of Is. 10c?. per hour was agreed upon to operate from 7th September, until 1st February, 1922, when the building trade industry in the district&apos; will be grouped under the National Agreement.Electrical Engineering Workers (National). The ballot of the Electrical TradesUnion on the proposed agreement to regulate wages according to a sliding scale based on the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; index number, has resulted in a majority favourable to accepting the agreement.   A joint committee will meet this month to make the first adjustments.Railwaymen (Ireland). The award of the chairman of the Irish Railways Arbitration Tribunal* was issued on the 12th instant. The award approves the adoption of the principles of standardisation in the settlement of wages and conditions of service on the Irish Railways, subject to a classification of the various railway groups, or sections of railways, with a view to securing, as far as practicable, uniform rates of wages and conditions on all railway-groups or sections in the same class. The reasonableness of maintaining an eight-hour working day in some grades of Irish railway service is recognised, but the universal application of an eight-hour working-day is decided against as being inconsistent with the solvency of certain of the railways, and so rendering im-possible their restoration to that state of efficiency which subsisted prior to the period of Government control.Dissatisfaction with the terms of the award has been expressed by the men. A meeting between representatives of the companies and of the unions to consider the terms of the award will be arranged as soon as possible.Chemical Workers (Pontardawe). A dispute that threatened to arrest the application of the national settlementf to the chemical industry throughout South Wales arose in the works of Messrs. L. G. Lewis &amp; Co. through the employees action in withholding wages from men who had left work without notice, and in issuing summonses against them for breach of contract. The firm having now withdrawn their summonses, and the men having promised not to leave again without notice, work has been resumed on the terms of the national settlement.Brewery Workers (Sheffield) The following reductions in the wages of Sheffield Brewery workers have been agreed upon : inside and outside male workers 5s. per week on 8th October, and 2s. per week on 11th November ; women workers, 3s. per week on 8th October but no reduction in November.Yorkshire brewery workers generally will lose 4s. per week in September, 2s. per week in November and Is. per week in December.* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 11,10th September, 1921, p. 104. t See this Report Vol. IV, No. 10, 3rd September, 1921.  p. 99.
