[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1921.SECRET.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the following telegram which has been received from the Government of India.E. S. M.6th October 1921.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 1st October 1921.Priority A.2298 S. Turkey. So convinced are Muslim India, Afghanistan and Central isia generally that Great Britain is the dominant world (? Power omitted), that aothing we say to the contrary can disabuse them of the idea that Turkey&apos;s plight lies at our doors, and that her future lies in our hands. If His Majesty&apos;s Government could now come forward and assist Turkey in mitigation of peace terms, especially over Thrace and Smyrna, the result within India itself would be immediate, while externally, and especially in Afghanistan, Bolshevism would receive its most effective sounter blow. If (? His majesty&apos;s Government) feel unable at present moment to inter-rene effectively, even a generous gesture to Turkey would go far to ease general Islamic ferment in Central Asia against Great Britain. And in view of difficulties that now jonfront us in India, Afghanistan and on the frontier, we earnestly beg that His. Majesty&apos;s Government will favourably consider these suggestions.470S     100   10/21
