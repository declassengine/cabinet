There have also been disturbances in Leicester.There is evidence that the Communist Party is making the National Administrative Council of Unemployed a weekly money grant for propaganda.Last night Stepney Borough Council decided, by 29 votes to 21, to disregard the precepts of the London County Council, Metropolitan Asylums Board, and Metropolitan Police and to levy a rate to &quot;cover &quot; only local needs and the needs of the Poor Law Authorities as a protest against the continued imprisonment of the Poplar Councillors.According to the Town Clerk the Poplar Councillors expect to be released to-morrow.Extracts are given of the constitution and methods of the British section of the Young Communist International.Sylvia Pankhurst intends to join forces with the new &quot;Left Wing&quot;   -International which is being formed in Germany, Holland and America.Norah Smytbe has brought money back from the Continent which has enabled the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; to continue publication.A report of the recent Congress of the Women&apos;s Communist International in Moscow is given.v   There is much unrest in the Wwlsh coalfields.The Colliery Enginemen and Boilermen have decided to secede from the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain but are prepared to make an agreement which will not interfere with independent action.Negotiations between the enginemen and their employers are to be resumed to-day.
unemployed on September 23rd the wholly unemployed on the registers numbered 1,445,000 end the partially&apos; employed 345,000.Apart from the processions in London on October 4th the number of unemployed who have&apos; demonstrated shows a further decrease, the total reported-being about 55v000. On October 4th, however, largely aa a result of exhortation in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, from 12,000 to 20,000 unemployed (the newspapers greatly over estimated the number), who had marched&apos;in contingents and&apos;&quot;something approaching military ^formation from all parts of London, assembled outside the London County Council offices on the Embankment: they stretched in an unbroken line from four to twelve deep from Temple Station to Blackfriars Bridge.   A proposed meeting in Trafalgar Square   had b sen&apos;prohibited by the Commissioner of Police as the requisite four days&apos; notice had not been given and&apos; the unemployed were accordingly diverted to Hyde Park, where inflammatory speeches were delivered by members of the London District Council. Banning ton, the organiser, stated that&apos;on the previous evening he had been served with an order forbidding him to lead a demonstration to Trafalgar Square: in spits of  r this order he had intended to&apos;speak from the plinth and ha knew that others were anxious to go there.&apos; He- then said that certain Poplar Councillors, who were not in prison, had taken over command&apos;upon the Embankment and led them like sheep to the Park,   He, personally&apos;, had no intention of coming there, and providing that he had the support of his comrades, was quite willing to march back to Trafalgar Square and hold a meeting in&apos; spite of the Police.
Ho knew that it would be a case of being arrested but he did not mind that.   A shout then went up from the audience &quot;Let us go to the Square&quot;.   Hannington said, &quot;Who is willing to follow, me there?&quot; and practically the whole of his audience put up their hands.   Shortly after a procession was reformed and marched via Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road to Trafalgar Square.   Whilst in Charing Cross Road the various banners were furled and the poles of temporary ones broken up and handed to men in the procession, apparently to be used as weapons against the Police.   Mrs. Thring had told the crowd that they could easily unhorse the Mounted Police by twisting the toes of their left f*sot downwards.On arrival at St. Martin1s Church the unemployed, as correctly stated in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, &quot;attempted to pass through cordons of police&quot;.   Some of the demonstrators swarmed over the wall into the square and a number mounted the plinth.   A baton charge was made by foot and.mounted polios and a general meslee ensued in the course of which one policeman   and several unemployed were injured.   Mrs. Thring was arrested for using insulting words and behaviour and for obstructing the police.   She was &quot;bound over yesterday at Bow Street in the sum of  5 to keep the peace for twelve months.The processions in the earlier part of the day provided striking, evidence of the exploitation of the unemployed by the &quot;Reds&quot;.   A high percentage of themarchers/
- a -375marchers were lads who bore no signs of privation but wore large red rosettes:   several red flags were carried and officious stewards with red brassards struck a definite note of organisation.   Many banners were carried bearing inscriptions such as the following:&quot;1914 Popularity and Fags - 1921 Charity and Rags.&quot;&quot;1914 Mobilisation and War - 1921 Starvation and Jaw&quot;.&quot;1918 End of the War - 1921 Volunteer for Moor.&quot; Copies of &quot;Out of Work&quot;, which was advertised by posters bearing the words &quot;Getting them on the run&quot;, were sold and &quot;Daily Rerald&quot; posters urging the release of Poplar councillors were also in evidence.It is not without interest that at the meeting of. the London County Council, which&apos;was the nominal cause of the demonstration, Harry Gosling stated that the labour leaders were on the brink of losing their control over the unemployed.The London District Council is attempting to organise four area committees in London, South Eastern, South Western, North Eastern, North Western.    These committees are to be under the direct control of the London District Council and independent of local committees. This plan is probably the result of the dissensions which seem the rule on the smaller committees: in Kensington, for instance, there is controversy owing&apos; to the fact that one section insists on the use of collecting boxes, irrespective of the Communist party  s prohibition. Should these area committees materialise tney will strengthen the hands of the London District Council,;&apos; which/
which is to a great extent dominated by Mrs. Taring, who is a fanatic holding the opinion that the end justifies the means.   She is usually attended by a body-guard of irresponsible boys, who are ready to render her absolute obedience.Some of the London agitators begin to show signs of nervousness.   They are slightly more guarded in their utterances and show a disposition to adopt pseudonyms; Lyle, for instance, now speaks as Comrade &quot;Onions&quot; and Russell as Comrade &quot;Carrots&quot;.Hanson, wno has adopted the habit of leading the unemployed to Fulham Church, commandeering the front seats and leading them out before the collection! appeared at a Putney meeting of the People1fc League on October 2nd: in company with about 60 of the Pulham unemployed he persistently interrupted the speakers until told that a constable would be asked to remove him, when  ;his courage evaporated.Preparations for the &quot;week of national agitation&quot; are being pressed forward but as far as oan be judged at present, widespread disorder seems unlikely although some trouble is possible in certain industrial centres.In response to an enquiry regarding Boards of guardians the National Administrative Council ofUnemployed has sent the following reply to one of theLancashire Unemployed secretaries:&quot;Concerning the powers of the Board of Guardians, I da^t think that you can do better than obtain the book entitled &quot;poor &quot;Law Administration&apos;, which should be obtainable from the local library.   On the question as to how far they are allowed to go, if you will take into consideration that the Ministry of Health sent out notices to all the Guardians to the effect that they must reduce the allowances given in relief as much as possible, and also endeavour to establish as a principle -that all relief is granted as a loan, you will understand how far they are allowed to go.    It is just this far: as far as you can mgke them.&quot;As/
As anticipated in my last Report, the work of agitators such as Jennett and Ley has resulted in disorder at Leicester on September 26th about twelve unemployed visited two restaurants and demanded food without payment; the police were sent for and three men arrested but subsequently released with a caution. On September 28th inflammatory speeches were delivered by Jennett and Ley and on the morning of the following day these men headed a procession to the Poor Law Offices. Later, on the same day, unemployed entered a coffee-house and demanded food but were removed by the police, and Jennett and Ley subsequently told a Labour Exchange official, who had removed notices of an unemployed meeting from the Corn Exchange, that they would "sabotage" the Exchange. On September 30th about 1,500 unemployed attempted to rush the Poor Law Offices and the police were forced to make a baton charge: several people were injured and Jennett and Ley were arrested. An attempt had previously been made to take possession of the Trades Hall, but this was frustrated by the police. In the evening of the same day wild scene occurred in the thoroughfares and round the Clock Tower: police were jeered at and stones and iron bolts thrown at them: windows were smashed and ordinary civilians injured and the police were obliged to make a further charge. R.V. Harvey, the Birmingham communist, has now arrived in Leicester in connection with unemployed agitation and Remmington, of the Socialist Labour Party, is also active/
active. It is reported that three or four London agitators are also being sent to the city, where further disturbance is likely to occur. Jennett told my correspondent during the week that the recent fire in the East End of London had been caused by the unemployed, acting on the instructions of the London District Council.

There is dissension among the Nottingham Unemployed Committee, which has dissolved into a feud between a man named Callardine and the communist Harry King. There is increasing discontent in the outlying districts of Nottingham such as Beeston, Carlton, Colwick and Netherfield, where unemployed committees are being formed. In Coventry, Tom Dingle is still attempting to obtain  control of the unemployment.

In Birmingham 17 unemployed committees have so far been formed; the majority have been organised by Wakefield, Divisional Organiser of the National Administrative Council of Unemployed, and are affiliated to that body.

63 meetings were held during September, the average attendance at each being 400; many of the committees are dominated by communists but the police have the situation well in hand at present.

In Wolverhampton the unemployed became restive owing to the refusal of the Guardians to receive a deputation but have now told the Chief Constable that if the Guardians will award relief on the scale given in Birmingham they will undertake not to hold any public meetings or give any trouble.

                                                                                 There/

 

 
There is evidence that in Newcastle and Sunderland the communists have gained control of the -unemployed ^movement.In Lancashire and Cheshire meetings- and marches of the unemployed are of frequent occurrence and in several cases revolutionaries have threatened that unless their demands are met they will adopt other tactics.     In Liverpool, where daily meetings are &quot;being held, the doctrine is preached that hungry people have the right to steal food.   The unemployed --committee has announced that it is goins to publish a newspaper entitled &quot;Justice for All&quot;, edited by the Rev. J. Vint-Lgughland with the assistance of a Liverpool journalist.    Communists at St. Helens have engineered a strike of uhemployed because the&quot;Corporation refuse to pay more than Is. an hour for work for which the trade union rate is Is-S^-d.Communist organisation of the unemployed in ;Scotland has, so far, been on a more;or less local basis but Robert Stewart has now received instructions to link up the various groups.In the Glasgow district unemployed meetings are being held daily and- stone-throwing occurred at Greenock on September 30th.   My &quot;correspondent reports that there is considerable outcry among all classes owing to the profiteering of retailers: fieh, butter, fruit and vegetables are frequsntiy alj-ewed; to -rotbecause certain prices cannot be obtained icr theme    In &amp;pi te of the imprisonment.of John McLean,&quot; his hooligan followers are demonstrating   daily under the leadership ofMc Shane/
McShane, Duffy and Dundas.It is reported from Dundee.that the- unemployed, are controlled hy communists who seem to he in receipt of funds from-an outside source; the secretary is at present undergoing 3b(days&apos; imprisonment for child desertion and is to he charged on his release.with using threats against the Inspector of Poor, on September 17th.During the week reports have been received of meetings . in the following places:-   Ash ton, Battersea (5); Birmingham (2); Birmingham (Costa Green), Bolton, Brixton (3); Cable Street, Clapham (.6); Clapham Junction, Darwen, Bent on..

m. 9 -Apart from the demonstration on October 4th, little interest has heen shown in the Poplar Councillors during tho week, although the National Union of Police and Prison Officers continues to hold small meetings outside Brixton and the Communist Party outside Holloway Prison.     The audiences, whicii are usually composed of the same people must know the. : speeches by heart.    The councillors themselves are beginn ing to rue their ac11on.   The Mayor, Sam March, &apos; considers that he has been &quot;led by the nose&quot; and says.   that he would not have gone to. prison, had he knownwhat he knows now.     George Lansbury is accused of having appropriated all the kudos and the councillors are far from being united, thoitgh keeping up the appearance of a firm front:   they hope that somehow an easy way out&apos; of the difficulties will be found.According to the Town Clerk of Pcplar they are expecting to be released on Priday next.g?H]5-.-COMMUNISTSOne of my correspondents has obtained temporary .     possession-of some notes belonging to an.important member of...the Communist Party Executive:   from these it appears, that at a joint meeting of the Communist Party and the National Administrative Council of Unemployed, held in August, the former agreed to make a v/eekly financial, grant to the latter for propaganda, v/hich was to be taken out of the &quot;proper fund for ; .    -       - . general/
general expenses.&quot;     The money was required chieflyto finance &quot;Out of Work&quot;,   In connection with thismeeting occurs the entry &quot;Suggested Barrow-in-Furness,Coventry, other centres affected besides London militarystanding prepared.&quot;    The proposal for a nationalconference after the week of agitation emanated from theCommunist Party, which considered that it should be heldin the Midlands.     The notes continue:-&quot;Military service going to struggle for it... Police Bodyguard,     Quiet demonstration. Unemployed movement - an injury to one is an injury to ail.     Support the rent strike.     Leaflets the best use of Bame round the Wards.   Perth (Black Watch Depot) 63 arrested no communists - some drunks looting.   Parish Council window smashed.     Tuesday -Police to provoke.     3 o1 clock in morning.   Deal with question of no rent.   Chalked all street comers.   Why starve in midst of plenty.   Demonstrat Fight for Pood not Medals.&quot;Since the Moscow Congress of the ThirdInternational, at which there was a rupture between the supporters of bolshevism and the syndicalist group, a movement to set up a left wing or rival internationalhas been started.     Tom Mann appears to beconnected with this group and it is probable thatDick Beech and Sylvia Pankhurst will also join it.It is reported from abroad by a correspondentwho has seen the Russian document that, by order of the propaganda department of the Third International, Sbapiwho has recently been in Russia, is at present stationed;in England, and that Brandenburgsky, Kingsepp, a prominent Esthcnian communist and Ausen have been orderto come to England.My correspondents are of opinion that while theCommunist Party is making no progress as regards memberjfa large and growing section of the working class is beginning to believe that nothing could be worse than 1jpresent conditions and that communism might prove achange for the better.W
In reference to the article &quot;Civil War this Winter&quot;whioh was quoted in ray last report, the editor of &quot;TheCommunist&quot; in a secret report made to the Party Executivemeeting on September 24th wrote:-&quot;t think that the question that the paper should concentrate upon is unemployment, and Is its present revolutionary significance. In the current number we sail jts^ near the wind on this subject as we dare. it is most important thai these issues of the paper should be got into the hands of the unemployed.&quot;It will be notioed that articles on industrial questions, as suggested by the B.O. occupy a greater space in the peper than before.&quot;We have finally severed our oonneotlon with 1Glint&apos; the American artist who did some drawing for us, on the grounds of inoompetenoe.    Now ^Espoir&apos; is the only artist with a more or less permanent connection with the paper.   Be has done most effective work reoently and I am running a special pictorial number next week, of the kind which we ran to welcome the Crown Prince of Japan. The subject will be bourgeois justioe, and snob of the materiel as I have seen is excellent.&quot;Steps have been taken, in accordance with * suggestion made et the  .0. to approach Anatole Prance to ask him for some unpublished work suitable for a serialo   I have attempted some search alternatively, for any Russian masterpiece pro duo ed sinoe the Revolution, but without any success,&quot;The paper this week is somewhat more guarded butreports a conversation with Minnie Lansbury in Bolloway,whioh amounts to Incitement to violence.   The paperendorses her advice and adds &quot;Even George lansbury hasindignantly demanded that something be done outside.    but what can be done?   Only that the unemployed make themselvesnasty&apos;.&quot;On Ootober 3rd a correspondent had an interesting conversation with Leicester Kent/ one of the leading communists, in Lancashire and secretary of the Earl est own unemployed committee.   Kent said, in reference to the week of &quot;National Agitation of Unemployed&quot; that the Communist Party are fully aware that the Government cannot possibly concede the latter demand, because if they did concede it the result would be a complete smash-up of Capitalist interests.   the communists/
- IE -Communists consider this their trump card, as it is confidently expected that when the Government8s &quot;unjust refusal&quot; is diplomatically driven home to the unemployed by communist speakers, etc., the movement will) receive a tremendous fillip. &apos;   The main reason for organising a special Agitation Day on the 13th is that as] the unemployed will have numerical advantage over the Police, the latter will he powerless to interfere with an) plans made by the National Administrative Council In oonneotion with the demonstrations.   This did not necessarily mean that there would be any violent disturbances by the unemployed;   Por one thing, the average British working man is too much afraid of the powers that be.   The mere glimpse of a policeman^ uniform was sufficient to scatter a crowd at any time. Kent thought, though, that with men at their head to remind them at the orucial moment that a policeman was only a man like themselves and was powerless against numbers, it might have a steadying effect.   Personally, however, he was entirely opposed to violenoo in anj^fonu as he believed that more could be accomplished by us i^ oners brains.    Be considered it highly dangerous to inoite crowds to disorder, because a mob was liable $io run wild and be quite beyond the control of any commit^ Kent added that the Gommunist movement was.growing la; tlilj oountry, and he replied that the movement had made great strides sinoe the unemployment question beoame so acute.   He had found it expedient, however, not to use the word communism in his secretarial oorrespondence, as there seemed to be a wide-spread prejudice against the word.    Young, the previous secretary, had &quot;nearly smashed up ths show&quot; by hiffvstrong partiality for using the word communism at every opportunity.In/
In regard to a suggestion re the organisation of collections on behalf of the unemployed, Kent said that he had received instructions from Headquarters to the effect --r that such collections should not he encouraged j   the reason being that while the unemployed were receiving assistance they would remain apathetic, whereas if they were left alone until their condition was desperate they would be ripe for desperate measures.At the end of the miners&quot; strike, Crossley, theLancashire Divisional Organiser of the Communist Party,began the organisation of communist cycle corps which wereto be used as a means of communication between branches^ inan emergency &quot;particularly in such an emergency as would arise In the event of Government interference.&quot;    Elevencycle corps are now in existence and    monthly meetingsof &quot;Captains of sections&quot; are being held..       The South $ales Divisional Council of the CootmunistParty of Great Britain, which met in Cardiff last week,has sent to headquarters a review of the communistsituation:   this Is signed by A.E. Cook, a member of theKatlonal Executive, Jaok Leckie, national propagandistand Wilson, South Wales organiser and is notuninteresting in view of the present unrest among thelocal miners:&quot;Reviewing the general situation in South Wales we have reached the conclusion that the following questions need immediate attention.1* Industrial policy , Parliamentary policy, Question of publications In Welsh language4. Financial and office arrangements.- On the first item there is need for the Communist      41 Party to give a definite lead to the mining -industry^   The unofficial minors movement having oeaaed to exist it is necessary the&apos; CP. should give a lead on Industrial matters.     Prankly we assort that if the GbPi,   does not give that lead it will fail in its task, and will have to yield to some o-uher organisation,..To/
&quot;To secure the thorough thrashing out of an     -industrial policy locally we suggest first that a    &quot; special committee consisting of S.W. Divisional Committee and a number of leading industrialists in I 1 ^the C.P. of S. Wales meet together,and agree on a policy.   And in connection with this we request headquarters to back us up with the necessary finanol I to get this committee going, and then after we in the 0.P, have agreed on our policy, to convene a larl committee, calling in the leading-left-Wingers and industrialists In the S.W.M.2P. to co-operate with us.   An$we propose that the result of such deliberatl might then be embodied in a pamphlet under the title! of &quot;The Miners New Step&quot; giving a lead to the whole I mining industry.     The result of this would be to government  all criticism that the Party is failing to meat the j bill, and will absolutely raise and assure the status the Party here, and probably result in bringing the industrialists now out of the CP. into the Party. We suggest the following under this heading.(a)     &quot;That in view of the acute economio position the miners fighting 1 on the ropes1 as it were, we must make the slogan of the miners be 1 Save the organisation, and the reconstruction? -of-same.. *     The proposed new rules of the H.F.G.B. afford   us an opportunity to get to work on the question of reconstruction.(b)   &quot;Unemployed problem.   Securing the full co-operation of employed and unemployed. Pit 1 committees represented on unemployed committees!(o)   &quot;Speoial educative policy.   Education of rank and file on pit control and strike policy.(d)   &quot;Slogans, Shift your Leaders;   Five Days per Week, Sis Hours per Day.Point 2.   Parliamentary Policy.     In view of the possible nearness of a General Election we suggest the Party should define its electoral policy.    Is it to oppose miners nominees as labour candidates on the political field whilst urging the rallying to the organisation on the industrial fields   Bow many candidates is the Party prepared to finar.ee in South Wales at the General Election?   Whether the Party is going to give a lead to our members to push nominations of communists as official candidates&apos;Point 3.     Publications.   We hear on good authority that the Pioneer Press at Merthyr is likely to come oil the Market shortly.    It is a fairly up-to-date &apos; plant and includes the weekly labour paper &quot;The Pioneer&quot;.   The price is about  2,000.    We urge the Party to consider the advisability of purchasing this press.   A local pacer and press would be a tremew advantages   Pamphlets could be issued on the spot particularly in tha Welsh language.   There is the need for Welsh literature and Welsh speakers.   This side of our propaganda has&apos;been sadly neglected but it is an important factor hero.Point 4.   Party Machinery. \(1)   A, S.? Wales Divisional Office is absolutely essential.
(g)   Finance must be forthcoming for Party development:(a) To allow Divisional Organiser to utilise service^ of unemployed members. Particularly op Unemployed agitational work.   This means sufficient finance to pay fares, etc., fcr members to travel to meetings.(b) Por oonvening meetings in places where no branches exist.(o) To meet the expense of committee meetings for Industrial policy.&quot;Finance is absolutely essential for the development of the Division, especially in view of thfc bankruptcy of members and branches.   The Divisional organiser has on many occasions to pay out of his own podLet for meals for committee and other members engaged in Party work, and it must be borne In mind that although huge propaganda meetings oan be got together, yet same only furnish a few shillings by way of collection.&quot;There has been a sequel In Coventry to the recent opposition of ex-service men to the Chepstow communists: on September  9th Dingley, Cresswell and Graham were severely heokled at a meeting in the Market Square: a free fight between ex-service men and communists ensued and the police intervened and sent both parties away.The antagonism of communists to orthodox labour leaders found expression during the week-end at Sheffield and Glasgow:   in the former city Arthur Henderson was persistently heokled while J.H0 Thomas was howled down and left the meeting.     Oh the same day John Robertson, and Ramsay Macdonald were severely heckled at Glasgow by John Maclean&quot;b supporters, who several times reduced the meeting to uproar.An illustration of the oxpenses of the Communist Party Is given in a letter sent by Fred Poet to R*o )ort Stewart on October 1st.   He enclosed a cheque for  50 for rent, a money order for  50 for McGIllivray but asked that the  20 for rates might stand over for a week &quot;asthe/
the expenses for your end come pretty heavy this week&quot;. (They include  24 for salaries).Peat has also sent  8 to Roderick Connolly 8 who is to receive this sum every week, possibly far contribution to the Communist&quot;.Gallacher, who is deputy chairman of the communist Party, intends to spend two or three months in london to replace MacManus, who is shortly to escort Meanor Mar ashes to Russia:   McManus intended to start in September but has   been delayed on account of the 6erman visa.Whitehead is in Berlin in connection with the Russia Famine Fund.    He took over the money already collected amounting to about  1,000   and has sent back a long list articles which are urgently needed and for which &amp; &quot;Collecting Week&quot; is to be organised in October.Whitehead, who appears much impressed with his own importance, is in daily touch with continental revolutionaries end has asked that his wife shall be sent over with a typewriter.   He states that tho follow in decisions were reached at a conference of the Central Committee held in Berlin on September 3Cth:1.     The British Movement is in this action of  1the greatest importance owing to the ^igh value of the ppuxtd sterling.
