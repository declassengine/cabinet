(THIS DCHJUMBET 13 THB PROPERTY Of HIS BRITAHHIC 1J&amp;JESTYT&quot;S GOVERNMENT)0 A B t B ,B T J^SECRET. ,. &amp;UEBMPipYt-fflKT.CP.8571. Revise.The Cabinet Committee on Unemployment which mot this morning under the ohairmanship of the Prime Minister:   the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the Exchequer being present, mate the following Report to the Cabinet(1)   It is estimated that there will be ll million men, women and young persons out of work during the winter. The reports of experts, though not altogether unhopeful, do not indicate any likelihood of a restoration of trade to anything approaching the normal within less than two years.   . During this period Government action will bfe . required in relief of unemployment..(3)   Mere measures of maintenance are, from every point of view, the least satisfactory.   They constitute thd most demoralising form of assistance to the. unemployed, and they contribute, nothing towards the solution of the permanent, as distinct from the temporary j unemployment problem.(3)   Relief works are only slightly better1 than maintenance They are mostly of little economic value, they draw men to occupations to which they are unaecuBtoned,and irt which their work is therefore uneconomical. - -(4)   Nevertheless, both maintenance and relief works will be inevitable during tho present scute emergency, and must be provided -to deal with the considerable margin tehich willibe left unabsorbed by any other schemt-(5)   Simultaneously, however, with such maintenance and relief work as are unavoidable, as much as possible should be done to stimulate productive employment.   The most hopeful schemes in this direction are the following:-
(a) The proposals of the experts who aocom-panled the Financial Secretary of the Treasury to Gairloch (as set out in 0.3?*-3565) for enabling capital works to be undertaken in this country or outside it by means bf State assistance, which could not otherwise be undertaken at the present time, on the understanding that the money, is utilised to provide employ-ment in this country.It was explained by the President of the Board of Trade that, from conversa-tions which he had recently had with bankers, he believed that a guarantee by the Government of the interest on loans required to finance new works and expendi-ture on railways and similar undertakings in India, in the Colonies and South America, would lead to the immediate placing of large orders in this country.   The bankers believed that the saving of interest which would be gained by the Government guarantee would be a sufficient inducement to the undertakers to pay today&apos;s prices instead of waiting for a further fall in the market.\h) The relation of the Export Credit Scheme to the foregoing will&quot;require further con-sideration.     Doubt was expressed as to how far any extension of the present scheme woul(J/contribute substantially to relieve the present problem.
It is further recommended:-Tbat he set up(6) a Committae/to consider and advise theCabinet as to the practicability and expediency for raising from thoso persons who are so fortunate as to be employed * a special compulsory distress levy of 2d. a week from the workmen) 2d, from the employer, and possibly 2d, from the State, for the purpose of forming a Distress Fund providing for wives and ohildren. foar whom the Unemployment Benefit of 15/- a week for the husband will not make sufficient provis-ion.     The Committee to advise as to the best manner in which the Pond should be spent, l.e.t by grants in money or in kind through the agency cf the looal Authorities, bearing in mind that grants of relief in kind would probably be most, eaoaom-ical.     The Committee to consist of:-The Secretary for Sootland (In the Chair)Mr. MoCuariy,Sir Wo Mitoh9ll**Thomson,Mr, Herbert lewis,.Sir Montague Barlcw.(7) That the contribution of the State, under the scheme approved by the Cabinet Unemployment Committee (See Appendix) for the assistance of Local Authorities in finan.-olng sohemes of relief workst should be increased from 50 per cent of interest and sinkirg-fuM for half the period of the municipal lean raised for tho purpose, to 55 per cent.(8) That the rate of wages on any relief works provided must be appreciably lower than the standard rate of wages for work of the same character.     The Ministry of Health circular has stipulated a rate of 75 per cent of the standard.
(9) The great-etiteULu Jjhr^^ owing tocessation of benefits under the National Insurance Act and the large accretion of claimants id relief on Poor Rates will lead to a serious oMsia in local finance, and the Unemployment Committee feel oonvinoed that some form of assistance to Poor law Guardians in necessitous areas is likely to become unavoidable.     It is considered that the beat form will be loan rather than grant, and the Ministry of Health and Treasury are engaged in determining the proper -safeguards for such loans.     It is at present impossible to determihe-the amount of money whioh will be required for suoh purpose.    The greatest-oaution will be required to.prevent an undue burden being thrown by the Local Authorities on tho State.
10.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook ts the unemployment dommlttes to provide  10.000*000 to cover, inter alia, expenditure oh approved schemes of the following types:(i)   Works financed by the lord St. Davida&apos; Committee.% (ii)   Schemes of land Drainage.(iii)   roads.(iv)   Public Utility Works, e.g. hyiro-eleotriodevelopment- , light railways, electrification schemes.(v)   Assistance to Poor Law Guardians in necessitous areas.hut pointed out that separate provision would he requiredfor the scheme proposed under (5)..The Committee were also of opinion that:-11. Schemes of afforestation do not offer suitable means for relieving unemploymentin view of the small number of men employable and the long period required for the work to become productive.12. The. situation of national finance is so serious as to require the most careful consideration of the effect of any scheme proposed In adding to the Floating Debt, and in reducing the funds available for Investment in Government loans for con-version or other purposes.13. It is useless to disguise the fact that profound unrest and bitter feeling are growing among the unemployed throughout the oountry.     A very large proportion of the unemployed to-day are not the usual type of unskilled or work-shy men, hut are largely people who all&quot;their lives have bean used to regular work, at good wages and many of whom are still making averyeffort/
