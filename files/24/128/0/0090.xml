BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECREff.CP. 3391.MS opfERENCEICABINET. sRELIEF OE DISTRESS, COMMITTEE. &apos; J&apos;  &apos;   &apos;   RSPOCT. &quot;1.    At. a Mooting on 6th October, 1921 (Cabinet 76(21) Conclusion (S)) tho Cabinet approved in principle the Report of the Conference between the Prime Minister, the Lord Privy Seal and the Cabinet Committee uoa. Unemployment.The 6th recommendation in this Report reads as follows:-(6)   To set up a Committee to consider and advise the Cabinet as to the practlca-bility and expediency for raising from those persons who are so fortunate as to be employed, a special compulsory distress . levy of 2d. a week from the workmen, 2d. from the employer, and possibly 2d, from the State, for the purpose of forming a Distress Fund providing for wives and&quot; children for vSiom the Unemployment Benefit of 15/- a week for the husband will not make sufficient provision. The Committee to advise as to the best manner in which the Fund should be spent, l.e., by grants in money or in kind, through the agency of the Local Authorities, bearing in mind that grants of relief in kind would probably be most economical.     The Committee to consist ofThe Right Hon. R. Munro, K.C., M.P., (in the Chair] The Right Hon. C.A. McCurdy, K.C., M.P., Sir ^^Mitchell-Thomson, Bt,, K.B.E., M..?., The Right Hon. J.Herbert Lewis* M.P., Sir Montague Barlow, K.B.E., .M..P.
OPE Off 2,     (1)   The Commltliee/^saTisfu^^ termsSSKa o  reference to them in light of a statement made bythe Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour&apos;    and recommend to the Cabinet -That It is expedient that for a limited peridd of, say six months, a Distress Fund should be raised by means of contributions from employed persons, their employers and the State.(2)   The Committee are impressed on the one hand&apos; &apos; with the administrative clifficulties of extending the scheme to persons not employed in trades insuredagainst unemployment, and on the other with the factthat this limitation will exclude agriculture and domestic service.,After full consideration the Committee recommend -(1)   That the c Ontributions should be levied only from trades Insured against unemployment *(2)   That In the event of agricultural unem-ployment becoming seriousj the Cabinet ;   should give separate consideration to * the a agricultural aspects of the problem.   ;(3)   That the Distress Fund should be applied for the benefit of wives and children of men in receipt of Unemployment Benefit of 15/- a week.5.     In connection with the above the Committee^attention has beon drawn to the statement in paragraph 36of the Final Report of Lord Ahercon\?ay,s Committee onOut-of-Work Donation (Cmd 305 of 1919) to the e ffeotthat the payment of supplementary donation for dependent children Is out of place and leads to undesirable results.The Commlttoe consider that the greater gravity of thepresent unemployment situation as compared with thesituation at the date of the Report in qiestion and theand the. Donation scheme difference between the proposed scheme/justify the excep-tional treatment of dependent children on the lines indicated in this Report.
4*     Scheme &quot;A&quot;*   On the- basis of a levy at the following rates -Employer*    ;EmbloyecU     State.   3?6taljMen 2d. 2d. 2d,        6d,Women, Boys) id. Id. 2d.        4d/&amp; Girls   )approximately  189,000 gross a week would be available.     The cost of administration is estimated at 10$ so that roughly   170,000 a week could be devoted to benefits.     On the assumption that the weekly returns will show 1,500,000 unemployed and that no destitution test is imposed, the available money would enable payments&quot; to be made of 3,A- a week for a wife; l/6d. a week for each child.Scheme&quot;Bff     On the basis of a levy at the following rates, which it will be observed involve a State contribution in excess of that contemplated in the terms of reference -Employer^ &apos;   Employed.     State.   Total.Men 2d. 2d. 3d.        7d.Women, Boys)        ld ld 2d 4d.&amp; Girls)approximately  250,000 a week gross    .:-r, after deducting cost of administration ( 24,000),  216,000a week net would be available.   This figure on thesame assumption as above would enable&apos; grants on thefollowing scale to be paid -5/*&apos; a week for a wife.l/*- a week for each child;or alternatively&apos;.   4/- a week for a wife, andl/6d, a week for each child.. The Committee
The Committee are&apos; impressed with the gravity of the crisis and also with the unpreo^euanl^ed^hara^rter of thesoheme proposed.     Thoy are of opinion that the justification of any such scheme would he that; it should yield suhstantialresults.     They recognise the importance of securingthe support of public opinion ^mmm^mm^m^, and they feel doubtful whether Scheme &quot;A&quot; would obtain shch suppcrt.They accordingly recommend -(1)   That the scheme should be based on the contributions indicated..in-Scheme &quot;B&quot; above.(2)   That the benefits should be either 5/- a v.eek for a wife l/&quot; a week for each child;or alternatively 4/** a week for a wife, and l/6d. a week.for each child.5.     The Committee wish to draw attention to the facts that (1) the increased cost to tho Exchequer of Scheme ,rB&quot; over Scheme &quot;A&quot; is roughly about  1,000,000 for the;-... 6 months; (2) if the benefits of the scheme are to be Increased/this can only be done by increasing tho rates of contribution, and (3) that a suggestion has been made to them that far moro popular diipport would be accorded to a distress.. levy scheme designed, on more herois. lines, and giving substantially higher benefits to wives and children even than are contemplated in Scheme ,rB&quot; above, (4) under tho existing Health and Unemployment Schemes for men the total contributions from employers and employed weekly amount to 25d. while the contributions from the State weakly to both schemes together amount only to 6d.
METHODS. Offg&quot;oTleoti6n.IgS destitu-mm test.6.   The Committee reoommend -(1) That contributions should be collected by means of carls and stamps on the analogy of Health and Unemployment Insurance, and ehouid be carried out through tho Labour $changes and the Post Office, tho Ministry of Labour being responsible for the administration of the scheme,(2) That ths cards and stamps should be kept quite distinct from those used for Unemployment insurance purposes.(3) That evory effort should be made to secure that Employers should assist in making the scheme a succoss in such matters as the obtaining and filling up of the cards, etc.(4) That sanction should be given forthwith tn print the necessary cards and stamps In advanoe of any legislation which may be necessary.       The acheme can on that footing be put in operation within four weeks&apos; time of the order to print.7.     The Committee have carefully considered whetherthe benefits of the scheme should be confined to per-sons who are not only unemployed but are also destl-tute.      While fully appreciating the desirabilityof conserving the fund as much..as possihXe-^Jiy--limiting the grants to persons really in need of them, theCommittee consider that an unemployed person receivingonly 15/- a week benefit, may probably be treated asIn urgent need of assistance if he has a wife andchildren to support.     Moreover, the adoption of thisview would greatly simplify administration.     Anydestitution test could in practice be applied only by the boards of Guardians &quot;or Local Authorities or special ad hoo bodies.       This would involve,    theCommittee are informed, complexity and indeedconfusion in administration.On these grounds the Committee reoommend  That no special destitution test should be imposed.
8.      The Committee -alac xsoBSl^ere* the. aT^estion. of ^iMWtfattg d^.. ,h*ojaifTta should he given in kind or in cash. .The Committee, while fully- appTe-eiAting-.th-t a^rvsitiage-of- . a system of grants in kind, are impressed with the many practical difficulties   inseparable from such an arrangement, ana they accordingly recommend the Cabinet   -To adept the principle of money grants.pa^ablo by way of supplement to the Unemployment Benefit.iTHB ;axBBLV It has been represented to the Committee that anyZjfSODUC-      soheme for imposing a eompalsory distress levy in pwe3ejrtrEG A sSHKMR0a THE&apos; ABbVa^oijrtnpnytanoes is almost ooriain to excite strong opposi--&quot;IN 33,tion in Parliament, and from Employers and workpeople:-generally and may in, itself eaoise-furiihe^ trade ^^ and that it might be preferable to provide the money required for the scheme by an addition   to the Income tax.     The Committee wish to draw the attontion of the Cabinet to this aspect of the matter and to recommend -That,while in view of the Committee a soheme on tho linos indicated above is at the present time practicable and expedient, the best course would be to have a pre-liminary discussion of the scheme with representatives of Employers and Employed^ and that an, effort should be made before the Introduction of a bill to secure substantial support of the principle which it embodies.QUESTIONS&apos; 10. OF DETAIL.The Committee recommend -That any questions of detail which may arise on the scheme should be left for settlement by the Treasury and the Ministry of labour in consultation,if necessary, with any other interested Departments-(Signed) B0B332 MUNBC.2, -&quot;Whitehall Gardens, 11th October, 1921.
