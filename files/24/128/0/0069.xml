In Malabar, Colonel Herberts column occupied Nilambur 14.30 yesterday without further fighting. Of 200 rebels in the vicinity. 50 believed moved north across Chaliyar Aourna River and remainder moved south. Killapetta Rayan among killed. Two platoons Leinsters from Calicut left Feroke yesterday, proceeding up Chaliyar River, due Mambad to-morrow morning. Two platoons Sutfolks visited Mauharakkat 24th, but rebels had left after looting all Hindu shops. This detachment rejoined rest of column Karimpuzha, 5 miles south-west of Mannarakkat. Rebels round Cherpulcheri surrendering and handing in weapons ; 233 prisoners taken. Mambad post made 23 arrests and captured some weapons. Dett, 83rd Wallajahbad Light Infantry, made three arrests Madrepora Edakkolam. In Madras, two bombs thrown at mill hands 0(5.30 without effect; otherwise situation there quiet. Armoury guards central station, Madias and Rajahmundry, withdrawn 21st.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 28lk September 1921.Following telegram has been received from General Officer Commanding Madras District, dated 26th September : -&quot; I have arrived at the definite conclusion that the powers and methods at present available for dealing with, rebellion in Malabar are inadequate. This opinion has been formed after careful consideration and discussion with Mr. Evans and Colonel S. Radcliffe and Mr. Humphreys. The actions recently fought at Nilambur and Nammini prove that the Moplah programme is framed upon guerilla warfare, plunder, terrorisation and avoidance of battle. Their resistance is getting stronger, the armed fighting gangs probably total 10,000 strong, and this total is tending to get bigger. ,   - -&quot; It is evident that the rebellion has behind it a deep influence of unsuspected strength. In my opinion a new and foreseen state, of affairs has come about which demands more drastic measures&apos;.&quot; To effect this, I need two additional battalions of infantry, namely, the Burma one offered in your telegram, and another, which I should prefer to be a Gurkha one. A pack battery of. 3&apos; 7 howitzers is also required. 4690     100   10.21
&quot; The present section of 18-pdrs. would return to Bangalore as soon as the fore-going troops arrive, and also three companies of the 83rd Wallahjahbad Light Infantry could go to Madras, so that the 88th Oarnatics could begin their disbanding.&quot; Furthermore, it is essential that the Special Tribunals and the Summary Courts, which now enjoy limited powers, should be supplemented under the existing Ordinance by means of additional military courts having more ample power to deal on the spot with rebels in an act of Avar against His Majesty&apos;s forces.&quot; The powers should include that of the death penalty, subject to final confirma-tion by me. I. also recommend that these Courts should be modelled on the &apos; Instructions relating to Martial Law,&apos; page 30, Regulation No. 24. Attempts to handle the situation as an ordinary outbreak are liable to collapse when application of the minimum military force is practised ; such efforts have been exploited to the full, but they have failed before the task.&quot; The situation now is clearly actual war, and famine, widespread devastation and prolonged rebellion can only be avoided by prompt measures to deal with it as such.&quot;Madras  Government propose  to  confer with General Officer Commanding Thursday next, and will thereafter report.   When report is received we will consider &apos; Local Governments views on proposals made by General- Officer Commanding, and communicate our conclusions in due course.From Viceroy, Rome Department, 28th September 1921.No. 788 Poll.    Following telegram received from Headquarters of Madras District, Wellington, dated 27th September : &quot; Situation 18.00, and for the Madras Press : No further development to report in Malabar.
