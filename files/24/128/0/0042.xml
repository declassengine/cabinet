Jt(THIS DOCUMENT IS THI,1, PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITAlTbTIC MAJESTY&apos; S G0VER2IMENT ).SECRET. P-^ 33*3*CABINET.FUTURE 03? THE SUPPLY jMARTMTc Memorandum by the Chief Civil Commissioner.It is not clear from Sir Eric Gedcles1 Memorandum of September 15th as to the Future of the Supply and Transport Organisation (CP. 3308) whether the recommendation in the penultimate paragraph - that the Government should now disband the Supply and Transport. Organisation - is intended to apply to the Supply Department.   The actual passages in the Memorandum which deal with this Department on pages 5 a-fld 6, though immedi-ately preceding the general recommendation referred to, are con-fined to arguments in favour of its retention.In addition to the facts adduced in the Memorandum it may be stated - -(1) That the estimate of running expenditure during normal times, i.e.,  400 per annum, is not likely to be reached.   This estimate was based on a period when certain printing expenses, which need not be repeated^ were incurred.   It also included an estimated sum for the travelling expenses of Chairmen of Volunteer Service Committees.   The whole scale of expenses for Chairmen was based on the &quot;Memorandum for the Instruc-tion of Chairmen of Volunteer Service Committees&quot; which had been drawn up before&quot; the Supply Department came into being.    In view of the experience v/hich has been gained during the past l8 months, the Supply Department had come to the conclusion that a much simpler form of Instructions should be issued, con-taining a much more economical scale of expenses. It is understood that the Treasury agrees with this view.
How that the Chairmen have had sufficient experience of their possible duties in an emergency, unless a further critical period should occur, their expenditure could be reduced to a negligible amount. (2) The Supply Department itself involves no expenditure. It consists of a General Inspector of the Ministry of Health who actB as Chief of Staff or Chief Assistant to the Chief Civil Commissioner and also co-ordinates the work of the Chief Assistants to the Civil Commissioners (General Inspectors of the Ministry of Health) and the local organisation of Chairmen of Volunteer Serrice Committees. This work is combined with his ordinary work as General Inspector of the Ministry of Health. The services of three officials of the Department of Overseas Trade are lent when required and, together with the Chief Inspector of Audits at the Ministry of Health, who acts as Financial Adviser and Finance Officer, they form a nucleus staff for the Department.   They are familiar with the Emergency work not only of the Supply Department but also of all the other Government Departments with whom it co-operates^ and with their assistance the Supply Department could take up its duties at the shortest notice.   It may be observed that none of these officers receive any remuneration for this work.If the Supply Department is retained in its present nucleus forui, and if the organisation of &apos;.. Chairmen of Volunteer Service Committees is simplified ae is contemplated, no clerical staff would be required in normal times and the necessary accommodation would he . limited to that for the Chief of Staff to the Chief Commissioner and the archives of the Department.
The Civil Commissioners themselves have proved to he most useful during the recent emergency, and it would he advisable to retain them even on a peace footing, so as to enable them to keep in touch with the Supply Department and with the organisation of their divisions.   Ho expense need be incurred in this connexion.I would, therefore, suggest -(1).   That the Civil Commissioners should be retained.(2).   That the Supply Department should becontinued in a nucleus form, which would also keep in being the local organisa-tion of the Chairmen of Volunteer Service Committees.The expenditure thus involved would he practically negligible,(Sgd.)   L.S. AM-3RY.28th September, 1921.
