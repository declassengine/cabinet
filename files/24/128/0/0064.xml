RESOLUTION.The Committee having&apos; considered the letter of the 19th September, addressed&apos; to its Chairman by the Sub-Commit tee on Mandates, endorses the views expressed in that letter, and recommends the Assembly to make a communication to the Council in accordance with the suggestion of the Sub-Committee.Ill-Geneva,19th September, 1921.Sir^-  The Sub-Committ e has considered the Draft Resolution handed in at the Assembly by lord Robert Cecil, in the following terms;&quot;The Assembly regrets the delay which has taken place in the definition of the Mandates, recognises that the Council is not responsible for that delay, and is of opinion that it would be desirable that the liandates of the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;En classes should be forthwith defined.&quot;2.    The Sub-Committee fully endorses the view expressed in the first part of lord Robert Cecil1s Resolution,   it, too, regrets the delay which has taken place in the definition of the &quot;A&quot; and trB&quot; Mandates.        At the same time it recognises that the fault cannot be said to lie with the Council.   ,    ^3.    The action of the Council in this matter is fully set Wt on pages 46-47 of its report, which is.before the Assembly (A.9). in brief, being apprised of the objection of the United States to tho definition of the Mandates without previous consultation with themselves, the Council determined to defer confirmation \ of the remaining Mandates until:the Covernmentsof the United    \ States had an opportunity of expressing their views.    It is       V understood that negotiations between the Principal Allied Powers and the United States are still proceeding, that a- Memorandum from the United States was received by.these Powers only.a few days before the Assembly met and that its terms are now under examination, .    There would seam no Option to tho Council &quot;out to give.time for the conclusion of these negotiations before confirming&apos; tha remaining Mandates. &apos;   -4.   Nevertheless, the Sub-Committee realises that the delay in the issuo of the remaining Mandates may cause anxiety and&apos; apprehension, anxiety because tha trust conferred by Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of i-Jations on tha Mandatories has not yet been fully defined;   apprehension last, in the absence of the completed Mandates, the sacrsd trust laid down by that Article may not.in all respects be fulfilled.
5.   The Sub-Committee has not felt it part of its duties to examine the draft Mandates,&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, nor yet to consider the Reports which the Mandatory Governments have in some cases, at any rate, submitted, to their National Parliaments, and communicated to the douncil for information, upon the adminis-tration of the Mandated territories confined to theit charge during their preliminary period.      The w6rld* however, will he able to draw its own conclusions from these documents, which are now public property, and from others which will shortly be available, and.it is to be hoped that tha anxiety and apprehension alluded to in the previous paragraph will be allayed by their perusal.6.   With regard to the &quot;An Mandates, the Sub-Oommittee feels that it would be in any case premature to press for immediate action by the Council.       It takes note of the fact that the Treaty of Sevres has not yet been ratified by the Powers.     As to these Mandates, the Subcommittee would only express its hope that, so long as the transitory conditions continue, the administration of the territories in question will/c^dsrried out in the spirit of Article 22 of the Covenant.The &quot;B&quot; Mandates, however, are in a different category, seeing that they are founded upon the Treaty of Versailles, which ms &quot;Drfen ratified.     Moreover, drafts of all the non Mandates have been before the Council since the beginning of the present year. Evan if these drafts are still Bub^ect to alteration in details, are not the principles enunciated such as could command the approbation of the Council?     Finally, the French and British Governments were charged by the terms of the decision of the Supreme Allied Council of May 7th, 1919, with the duty of coming to an agreement upon the future of Togo and the Gameroons, which they would recommend the League of Nations to adopts This agreement has now been reached and it is desirable tha^c- the Council should, at the earliest possible opportunity:(a) Formally approve the application of the Mandate system to Togoland and the Cameroons;(b) In particular, adopt, in principle, the declarations signed by the Representatives of the French and British Govern-mants on July 10th, 1919, as to the respective sphereB which are to be placed under the authority of each Government,7.   Accordingly, the Sub-Committee suggests that much will be gained if the Council could be invited by the Assembly, forthwith to address a despatch to the Powers entrusted with the administration of the territories /referred to in Article 23, para. 5, of the Covenant, indicating that, whilst the Council has not felt able to proceed with the confirmation of the &quot;B&quot; Mandates pending the results of .the\negotIations now proceeding between the Principal Allied Powers Wd the United States, and whilst examination of the  details ofI these Mandates must necessarily bo reserveyd in view of modifications which it may
- &quot;^WsotcsJUUy be found sutt^ahls to make in tho term a-jodTtheseMandates, idwr^c^k^ its pexusaX--of the cbcaftBK(if such should he the case) thfftv-S&amp;naj^fc^^^ theprinciples there laid, down express the high oh j sots vjhicir-the- ... Covenant has in view and lay down, In a spirit in harmony with that of the Covenants safeguards for the rights of all &apos; Members of the League.The Sub-Committee would further represent that the Council: should now formally approve the application of the Mandates system to Togoland and the Cameroona, and, in particular, adopt, In principle, the Declarations signed by the Representatives of the prenoh and British Governments on July loth, 1919. as to. the respective spheres whioh are to be placed under the authority of each Government.     Finally, it might he suggested that the Council should express its confidence that Msjidatoory^powers will continue to exercise the administration of the terri4^orles --committed to their-charge in the spirit of the-uxaft Mandates---until Such time as the position^shall have been definitely regularised..8.   The Sub-Committee feels convinced that the aotion by the Council, in particular such a communication fiom the Mandatory Powers, and such a measure of confirmation of the terms of the &quot;B&quot; Mandates, would not only be welcomed by the Mandatory powers themselves, but would serve as a token to the world of the earnestness of the League in pressing for the speedy realisation of the aims of Article 22 of the Covenant.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) PRIDTJOP MOT.;President of the Suh-committee^FUr-gxcalle nay Count de Gimeno,&quot;      President of Committee Mo.
