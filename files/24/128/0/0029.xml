\GENERAL.The abandonment by the Soviet Government of many of the prin-ciples of Communism is raising doubts in the minds of Bolsheviks abroad. The Western European Communists consider that a revolution is at present impossible, and have no wish to sacrifice themselves fo internal affairs in Russia. Meanwhile, active operations by the Third International have been for the time suspended owing to lack of funds, and efforts are being concentrated solely on the distribution of propaganda.The Balkan and East European States appear to be carrying out a policy of severe repression against the extremists in their respective countries.Particular attention is drawn to the article on the activities of the Red Trade Union International in England, which appears in Part II. of this number.PRANCE.The struggle between the Right and Left Wings of the C.G.T. still continues, but is likely to end in a victory for the Moderates.In spite of the fact that the French Communists are receiving funds from Moscow, propaganda is on the wane, and efforts to obtain sympathy for famine-stricken Russia have met with little success.The strike of textile workers in the north has been extended by the C.G.T. to other industries.   So far no settlement has been reached.BELGIUM.The two Communist parties in Belgium, which are led by Van Overstraeten and Jacqnemotte respectively, are now to be united under the leadership of the latter as the result of a decision by Moscow,ITALY.The draft commercial agreement between Italy and Russia is very much on the same lines as the British agreement. It has met with considerable opposition in certain Government circles on the grounds that the Anglo-Russian trade agreement has turned out to be &quot; a complete illusion.&quot; The Government appears to be determined to suppress disturbance-bances between the Fascisti and the Communists. The Firearms Act is being rigidly enforced, and penalties for carrying arms are to be increased.SPAIN.The labour situation in Barcelona has suddenly become much oasior, but the adherents to Communism are said to be increasing, and it is anticipated that a union of the two Communist parties will take place shortly.NOEWAY.There are indications that the extremists in Norway and Sweden are trying to co-ordinate their revolutionary policy.It is thought that another meeting will be held &quot;shortly by the trade unions in order to enforce the policy of adhesion to the Moscow Inter-national.The Norwegian Government has signed a commercial agreement with Moscow, which implies de facto and quasi-diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Government,a 2
SWEDEN.The disaster in Russia has had its effect on the working classes, and there is little chance of their giving support to the Communist Party, which itself is urging a policy of making common cause with the Moderate Socialists at the coming elections.DENMARK.The negotiations for a trade agreement with Soviet Russia havo so far not been completed.Unemployment has given considerable impetus to the Communist movement.GERMANY.A split between the Right and Left Wings of the United Communist Party has been averted by a letter from Lenin. He criticised both sections and emphasised the fact that unity was necessary to win over the majority of the organised workers of Germany to Communism.The Communist Labour Party has definitely broken away from the Third International, and is proposing to found a new International, which all national groups, restive under the lash of Moscow, will be invited to join.German schemes for trade and concessions in Russia have been considerably hampered by the famine.SWITZERLAND.Moscow has apparently decided that it does not get valne for money spent in Switzerland. It is thought that even a successful revolu-tion there would make an insufficient impression on the surrounding countries.At the Tenth International Co-operative Congress at Basle, which &apos; was attended by Dr. Polovtzeva, representing Russia, it was decided to make an attempt to establish international trade through co-operative channels and to formulate a scheme for an international co-operative&apos; bank.AUSTRIA.The Communist Party is very short of funds, but is making every use of the industrial crisis and unemployment. The police have issued a warning that any extension of agitation will result in forcible dis-solution of the Communist Party.HUNGARY.Moscow is endeavouring to start agitation among the soldiers, but funds are short and police vigilance is acting as a severe check to propaganda.RUSSIA.It is difficult to estimate the extent of the famine, which, though serious, is probably not so acute as the Soviet authorities make out. The crisis is likely to reach its height in December. It is becoming increasingly evident that the Soviet Government will only accept relief under its own terms and under its own control. Even admitting that the Soviet Government is sincere&apos;in its wish to get food to the distressed areas, it is highly improbable that the grain would reach its destination, owing to transport difficulties and the activities of the Green bands. Dr. Nanseifs agreement witli the Soviet authorities is likely to prove
4aabortive. There does not appear to be any guarantee that the dis-tributiou of supplies can ho carried on without the interference of the Soviet Government, nor is there any security for the loan of 10,000,0007. sterling which Dr. Nanseu is asking from the Allied Governments at the request of the Bolsheviks. The arrest of tho members of the Moscow Relief Committee is thought to be an act of provocation by Litvinolf aimed at Krassin, who may have seen in the Committee a chance of co-operation with, the better classes and of building up little by little a coalition.There are no immediate indications of a fall of the Soviet Government, but if the worst happens tho leaders will probably try to hold the industrial centres and let the rest go temporarily.A religious revival on a large scale is taking place.Krassin has made a mournful confession of economic failure. &quot; The &quot; English treaty has produced no lasting results, and KerjentsefPs &quot; treaties in Scandinavia have led to nothing. English firms are only &quot; offering short credit, whereas the Soviet requires at least IV ,e years &quot; for small purchases and up to 15 or 20 years for larger transactions. &quot; As regards concessions, in spite of the. protracted negotiations, not a &quot; single contract has been completed.&quot;POLAND.Employees in many public services have been on strike, believed to be due to Bolshevist and German Communist agitation. The Govern-ment is preparing to mobilise soldiers to operate the trains and public services. -GREECE.The repression of the Communists continues ; their headquarters have been raided and most of the labour executive are in prison.JUGOSLAVIA.The Anti-Communist Bill has been passed by a large majority, resulting in the annulment of the mandate of the Communist Deputies. There is now definite evidence that the attempt on the life of the Regent was the result of a decision taken by the Communist Party as a whole.BULGARIA.So far the Government has avoided the renewal of official relations with Moscow. Sweejjing measures against the Socialists are being prepared to take place in the immediate future.ROUMANIA.The Government has declared the Communist Party illegal and dissolved every Trade Union.TURKEY.The Bolsheviks, in conjunction with Enver, appear to be doing everything in their power to prevent the settlement of. the Turkish question. Although the population of Anatolia maintains its attitude of hostility towards the Bolsheviks, Euver&apos;s intrigues with the Turkish Communists, some of whom are occupying positions in the Anatolian Government and in the army, are causing Mustapha Kemal considerable anxiety. j
4bEGYPT.The Third Internationa] is considering the advisability of turning its attention to Egypt, which it considers a promising field for its anti-British activities.AZERBAIJAN, ARMENIA, and GEORGIA.These countries are now faced with famine, due to the same causes that are operating in Russia, i.e., Soviet maladministration. In Georgia tho peasantry and working classes are showing a growing hostility to the Communists.CANADA.Unemployment continues steadily, and at Vancouver the temper of the workless is growing more bitter. It has been definitely established that 2,500 dollars have been sent by the Pan-American Bureau to organise the Communist Party of Canada. This money came from Moscow.UNITED STATES OP AMERICA.The Communist Party has decided to establish &quot;Labour Alliances &quot; on both sides of the boundary. The American Labour Alliance is being set up in opposition to the American Federation of Labour. The alliance with the Canadians is not yet complete.The number of unemployed is increasing, and a winter of unexampled distress is in prospect.Senator France has returned from Moscow and hopes to persuade the United States Government to recognise the Soviet Government da facto.
CONFIDENTIAL.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES. FRANCE.The Struggles in the Confederation Generate du Travail.The struggle between extremist aud moderate members of the Confederation Generale du Travail continues unabated. The extremists are in despair because the moderates wish to separate themselves from them. They fear that the followers of Jouhaux will retain all the buildings and material belonging to the Confederation Gerierale du Travail, and will leave the extremists without meeting places. They have lately been appealing to the conscience of the moderates, basing their arguments ou the liberty of opinion and the principles of revolu-tionary trades unionism.It is gradually becoming evident that the moderates have, the upper hand and are determined to be masters in their own house.The Communists have been called to order for holding a special congress on the day after the close of the&apos;Lille Congress. They are reminded that they are a defeated party, aud have no right to establish an &quot; imperium in imperio.&quot; The Confederation has also issued its ruling in the dispute that has split the Rail waymen&apos;s Federation since the last congress, when the Left Wing unions obtained a majority and elected a revolutionary executor. The Confederation now over-rules this election, on the ground that certain Belgiair unions were not admitted to the vote, and declares the election of the Reformist Executive appointed by Bidegaray aud Ms friends 1o be valid. A new national congress is to be called in two months&apos; time in order to restore unity between the two opposing sections.Another significant event is the decision of the Federation of Clerical and other Workers and the Federation of Agricultural Labourers to exclude the recalcitrant unions which adhere to the revolutionary trade union organisation. Two organisations will thus exist, as is already the case with the railway workers.The Central Executive of the Revolutionary Trade Union Committees, who represented the minority at the recent Congress of the Confederation Generale du Travail, have issued a declaration reaffirming the autonomy of the French Trade union movement, and declaring at the same time that they hope to affiliate with the Red Trade Union International at an early date. They hope that a second Congress of the Moscow International may be called shortly, which will make it possible for the French Unions to affiliate without losing their traditional independence.The Communist members of the Federation of Railway Workers who seized the Federation offices two months earlier, were expelled at the beginning of August, on the order of the Seine Tribunal.
It is stated that the French Communists receive subsidies from the Soviet Government, but the authorities have so far been unsuccessful in finding proof sufficient to justify a prosecution. Everything points to a continued relationship between the Communist leaders in France and those in Berlin and Moscow.The Communist campaign is for the moment directed chiefly to the revictualling of Russia. At the same time a campaign of suspicion and distrust, in which &quot;L&apos;Humanite &quot; has an evil pre-eminence, is being led against the Governments who wish to assist the Russian people. The workers have been asked, on the usual grounds, to refuse to manufacture war material, and the Confederation Generale du Travail has gone so far as to forbid the metal workers to make arms and ammunition of any kind. This order has met with some obedience in the north, but the manufacturers, whose only present orders are for war material, have locked out their, employees. This state of things is not expected to last. Some Parisian, workers have taken up a characteristically egotistical attitude, and havo refused to obey the orders of the Communist Federation and the Confederation Geuerale du Travail, arguing that they cannot remain unemployed.; The campaign has produced another incideut which satirises Communist professions. Gaston Moufflard, the secretary of the Communist Section of Pan tin, and a model among Communists, who was administrator of the local co-operative, has absconded with the funds collected from his comrades, amounting to some 100,000 francs.The first flush of propaganda has, however, now died away and has been followed by a period of apathy. The clever compaign by the principal newspapers, exposing Communist fallacies and contradictions, has not failed of effect. The proletariat is asking how it is that the adoption of Communist principles in Russia has resulted in ruin and death. The economic crisis and the reduction of salaries are another brake on proletarian ardour. In spite of the furious campaign of &quot; L&apos;Hurnanite&quot; and other organs of class hatred, hardly 4,000 people attended a mass meeting organised in Paris in favour of starving Russia. The Communist leaders are attempting to revive morale by a series of mass meetings, and that gentle, aged cynic, Anatole Frauce, is one of those who will make an extensive tour of France. The leaders are. announcing that Moscow has fixed the world revolution for September 15th. This-is a blind, however, and if any movement is attempted it will not take place before the end of September.The &quot;independent attitude of Laporte, secretary of the Young Communist Federation, at the Congress of the Third International, has scandalised the Communist Federation. Laporte dared to charge Lenin  -it is; thought at the suggestion of Trotsky with trying to enter into au alliance with the bourgeois parties of the Entente. Hence Lenin&apos;s great coldness towards the French delegation.Labour Troubles.The strike or lock-out of textile workers in the north is now general and involves some 60,000 operatives. Strikes among the textile workers are also proceeding in Alsace, the Tarn and the Vosges. The textile workers of the north have been on short time for two months, and have had to face a difficult time. The decision of the employers to reduce salaries.fired the smouldering discontent, aud the lock-out, decided upon in &quot;the case&quot; of workmen refusing to accept the reduced scale of wages, completed the rupturel
The dispute has now extended to the union of foremen and overseers who do not form part of the Confederation Generale du Travail, and to the transport and leather workers serving the industry. The metal workers are in a state of ferment. The disputed question of the index figure has moved the Conseil General of tho Department of the Nord to send a resolution to the Ministry of Labour for the immediate convocation of the Departmental Commission to examine the present cost of living with a view to revising the index figure. They also ask for a reconstitu-tion of the Commission. A good deal of bitterness between the extreme and the moderate labour representatives was shown during the voting of the resolution. The Socialists, who have up to the present managed to keep control of the situation, wished to preserve the purely industrial character of the struggle ; the Communists following their usual policy of inflaming class hatred witness the reckless calumnies of &quot; L&apos;Humanity &quot;  wish to transfer the fight to political grounds. They would also like to lead the strike in correlation with their campaign against the mauufac-ture of munitions and arms, which is beginning to boar some fruit in the Paris districts. Here the Government, which does not wish to be confronted with a conflict in Paris as well as with one in the north, has recommended the greatest prudence and tolerance to the employers. Fresh troops have been sent to the north. These have had to intervene against the sacking of bakers&apos;and provision merchants&apos;shops, but they did so with extreme gentleness, both on orders received and of their own will.The struggle is keen, aud the extremists may at any moment get the upper hand. The quarrel between moderates and extremists appears to strengthen the position of the employers, who show at present no intention of modifying their attitude.Trade union organisations are trying to arrange a general strike of protest if salaries are not maintained at previous rates.The lock-out of dockers at Havre ended in a compromise.A Bolshevik on the Situation.A certain V. Prihodko, apparently a Bolshevik agent in France, has communicated to the Agitation Section in Moscow his impressions of the situation. These emphasise the sharp division between the two currents of Socialist thought. According to Prihodko, the leaders of the syndicates-calists are obsessed with the idea that Moscow has concentrated its efforts at present not so much on fighting Capitalism and the Yellow Socialists, as on attempts to break down the Syndicalist organisations, The party arbitration, proposed by Prihodko, was refused by the Syndicalists. Prihodko hopes that when Sadoul arrives he will be able to bring influence to bear on both sides, aud thus help peacefully to end the conflict. He states that Antoine Barass, who is going to England to replace Fachers, has been working for the last two years in Brittany, the &quot;Red Vendee &quot; of contemporary France, where the workers are alleged to listen more attentively to Bolshevik doctrine than the population of Central France, and particularly that of the north-east.Miscellaneous.There are rumours that Hugo Stinnes is at present secretly buying the shares in several very important Paris newspapers.A ship laden with foodstuffs, medical stores and clothing has left St. Nazaire under the French flag for Petrograd.Sentence of eighteen months&apos; imprisonment has been passed upon Louis Williams, manager of the newspaper &quot; Le Conscrit,&quot; for publishing
BELGIUM.Communist Activities.The Socialist Federation .of the Borinage has decided, at the forth-coming election, to contest with all its energy both the &quot; bourgeois &quot; reaction and the Communist movement &quot; attempted by a handful of Brussels hot-heads.&quot;An effort is being made to induce members of the &quot; Vlaamsch Oud Strijdersbond&quot; (Flemish ex-Combatants&apos;Organisation) to break away from Parliamentary groups and develop on revolutionary lines. This policy, advocated by extremists, has little likelihood of success. The militant members of the organisation are freely discussing the question of &quot; direct action&quot; against what is termed, the Francophile military, ascendency.Anticipating the apparently inevitable fusion, the members of the two Communist parties are fraternising. Van Overstraeten appears for the moment to have sunk his differences with Jacquemotte and to be advocating the same methods. It is generally thought that Jacquemotte will lead the united movement under the name of the &quot; Parti Communiste Beige,&quot; and it is probable that Van Overstraeten will be a member of the committee to be formed of equal numbers of the two existing groups, to direct the propaganda and campaign of the party.The &quot; Committee for the Fusion&quot; of the party has practically completed its negotiations, and the final conditions for the joining of the two groups have been sent to all brandies for consent. The congress which will ratify the conditions and officially form the Communist Party will be held early in September. Communists are to be asked to stay in the trade unions for the time being, and to work individually to gain new adherents to the Communist Party. A united provincial campaign is to be organised in order to capture new members.At the end of July, at Brussels, Jacquemotte gave an account of his mission to Russia, before the largest Communist meeting yet held in Belgium. He glossed over the lamentable condition of Russia, and asserted that it was necessary for the proletariat of the whole world to revolt, if the Russian revolution was to triumph. A resolution was passed protesting against the actions of Belgian &quot;militarists&quot; in occupied German territory.Van Overstraeten has been criticising the Belgian workers&apos; organisa-tions, which, in his opinion, are not alive to the necessities of the moment, and not equal to the need of preparing for a Bolshevik regime.an article inciting soldiers to disobey orders. &quot; Lo Consent&quot; was an Anarchist-Communist journal, run by the Association of Communist Youth.One Sebastian Schwartz, born at Bucharest, is said to bo an agent of Lenin and also to be in touch with Hugo Stinnes. Schwartz was in Paris during June, and afterwards left for Berlin and Stockholm, whence he was reported to intend&apos; going to Dublin and London. He spends lavishly on propaganda and is reputed to be a millionaire.On the occasion of his last journey to London Krassin is said to have met Mikailoff in Berlin as the secret agent of M. Briand. Mikailoff is alleged to have returned with some 500,000,000 francs worth of orders for French industry. It is said that the Soviet would prefer to trade with France, from whom they fear no commercial tyranny, rather than with Germany and Great Britain, whose ambition they seem to fear.
Miscellaneous.Contrary to previous reports there is no evidence that appreciable quantities of Russian jewels are being sold or offered for sale in Belgium.The headquarters of the International Federation of Unemployed in Belgium are reported to be at No. 51, Ommeganckstraat, Antwerp. One, Jan Chapel, is the secretary of tho branch in Antwerp. It is believed that these offices are not only the branch offices for Belgium, but that the headquarters of the whole movement are situated in Antwerp.A woman travelling with a Belgian passport issued at Stockholm in the name of Alexandre de Kramer was recently arrested on arrival at Antwerp from Stockholm. She admitted her correct name to be Alexandre Pfingsthorn. She is a German subject and worked during the war for the German Secret Service. She has produced conclusive evidence that M. Bovy de Witte, chancellor at the Belgian Legation at Stockholm, whose mistress she was, finding himself in debt, sent her to Warsaw and Riga with a proposition that he was willing to issue Belgian passports to Bolshevik agents^ M. de. Witte has been recalled to Brussels and placed under arrest, but not before many transactions favourable to the interests of the propaganda bureau of the Third International had actually taken place.ITALY.Relations with the Soviet.In the Senate it has been stated, on behalf of the Government, that it is not possible to ignore the de facto Government of Russia, for Italian trade must not be shut out from Russia by the competition of other countries. The draft commercial agreement between Italy and Russia contains the explicit obligation on the part of the Soviet to abstain from all political propaganda in Italy. The agreement provides for a mutual undertaking to open negotiations immediately for an economic and commercial agreement of the widest kind. Russia will give Italy the same facilities and advantages as other countries and she will give equitable consideration to Italian claims for credits.Senator Gonfalo has sharply criticised the government&apos;s attitude to the Russian commercial delegation pointing out that no diplomatic precedent existed for italy&apos;s entering into an agreement with a govern-ment that was not recognised. He thought that the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement had turned out to be a &quot; complete illusion.&quot;According to the &quot; Epoca,&quot; Vorovsky&apos;s first important purchase in Italy for the Soviet is Italy&apos;s two greatest airships specially constructed by the Fiat Company to cross the Atlantic. They are to go direct from Turin to Moscow.The Socialist Programme.Sigouri Turati and other leaders of the Socialist party have issued a manifesto advocating a union of the Socialists at the forthcoming Congress. The document is resolute in tone; it openly condemns Bolshevism, and acknowledges that the bourgeois regime still has a mission to accomplish. Turati goes so far as to oppose the direct participation of the proletariat in the Government at a moment which is full of danger. The party may have to decide at the Rome Congress whether it is to remain aloof or to transform itself into a real Government party. In the latter case the Communists may succeed it as the party of the masses.
ioThe Government has determined to proceed with the disarmament of the Arditi del Popolo and tho Fascisti. The Firearms Act will be enforced ; exceptional powers will, if necessary, be given to the police ; and penalties for carrying arms will be markedly increased. Legislation is proposed for the supervision of the badly guarded-ammunition dumps aud arm stores scattered throughout Italy. In view of the vast quantities of arms and ammunition now in the hands of the populace, these measures can scarcely be effective.Moro trouble has meanwhile occurred between Socialists and Fascisti in several parts of Italy, though in some centres peace really seems to exist.The Fascisti in the province of Emilia Romagua having disapproved the peace with the Socialists, Signor Mussolini, who organised the Fascisti, has resigned from the Executive Committee. The Fascisti hostile to the agreement argue that they were duped into a peace which did not oblige the Socialists to respect the Fascisti. They complain that their party has been attacked in various towns by Communists and Socialists, aud that the Government has done nothing to prevent such assaults. The cabinet has, however, repeated its strict instructions to the authorities to repress the internal guerilla.Miscellaneous.The Turin police have raided the Communist daily, &quot; Online Nuovo,&quot; aud arrested 25 persons described as Red Guards.The metal workers have agreed to a reduction of wages in accordance with special circumstances at the various factories.The cotton masters have demanded a 50 per cent, reduction of wages, which has been flatly refused by the National Federation of Textile Workers. A general strike is threatened. The chemical workers have also resolved to resist a reduction of wages.Enver Pasha is reported to have referred to the recent Spanish reverse in Morocco as the beginning of a rising which would spread to Tripoli. Pan-Islamic propagandists appear to have been active in Tripoli.Ali Bey Shemsi&apos;s pro-Zaghlul propaganda is said to have resulted in the Egyptians in Rome protesting against Adli Pasha&apos;s going to London with the official delegation. The inducements offered by Ali Shemsi are said to have inclined various newspapers in Rome, Milan, and Genoa to&quot; assist his propaganda.Trebitsch-Lincoln, who is now  in Rome, has  submitted certain articles,  which  he  calls   &quot;wonderful,&quot;  and   for  which   he   wants 2,000 dollars, to the Hearst Syndicate for approval. -The&quot;French police.&apos; have issued instructions that Lincoln is not to be allowed to enter France.SPAIN.The Situation in Barcelona.The labour situation in Barcelona has rather suddenly become very much easier. Police action, however harsh it may be, seems to be succeeding in making the profession of murder risky. Anido has been ordered from Madrid to refrain as much as possible from arresting any more syndicalists, so that the working classes may not be ,unduly incensed.
The police and the press attribute importance to the arrests of terrorists which have recently taken place. These are mostly young-people between the ages of To and 21, who received a salary of 100 to 150 pesetas per week for their work. Their confessions are said to implicate other people more highly placed than themselves.The workers are glad of the peace which allows them to work quietly for good wages, and they are largely relieved from the unpleasant duty of subscribing to the syndicates, which are now collecting money on a very much reduced scale. Unemployment has considerably diminished. Anti-militarist propaganda continues at Barcelona and Valencia, but nothing serious seems likely to come of it.Recent discoveries are said to establish that the syndicalists are better off financially than was generally thought, and are estimated to possess about one million pesetas. It seems to have been intended to institute reserve funds all over Spain, but aa far &quot;as is known the syndicalists have succeeded only in Barcelona. The death of Boal, who manipulated all money, including the secret funds, will probably have a far reaching effect on the organisation in Barcelona. The income of the syndicates was put in July at about 15,000 pesetas a week, of which the collectors keep about 5,000 pesetas.The Progress of Communism.The Spanish delegates to the Third International were R. M. Garcia, secretary of the Spanish Communist group, J. Ramos, G. Sanz, R. Milla, A. Pnmarega, and H. Arlandis. At the last congress only one man was sent from Spain ; on this occasion the Spanish party, practically all of them manual labourers, was made as strong as possible. The delegation complained that they had great difficulty in reaching their destination. Four delegates represented the Confederation National del Trabajo, and the Partido Communista Obrero also sent four delegates. Spanish labour, encouraged by the representation of its three great parties, is expecting great things and the final disappearance of differences of opinion to result from the congress.Hopes of a split in the Communist ranks have so far been dis-appointed. Both the Partido Communista Espanol and the Partido Communista Obrero are members of the Third International, and in agreement upon all political and social questions. A formal union is a very possible outcome of the forthcoming Communist Congress. Some difficulties arise from Communist co-operation with the Syndicalists, who are looked upon as clearing the path to Communism throughout Spain. The adherents to Communism increase daily, and the Miners&apos; Syndicate of Asturias have thrown over their old leader Llaneza and joined the Partido Communista Obrero.John Arnall, the prominent Socialist and pro-Turk, whose activities in gun-running and subverting the natives in Morocco have more than once been mentioned, informed the Spanish Ambassador in London quite frankly that he was working for the Moors on the Riff.Miscellaneous.Documents regarding the arms stored in Spain have been sent from America to Berliu for transmission to John de Kay. It is suggested that knowledge of the movement of these arms and of the active participants in securing them may be obtained through the American Consular Service in Spain. The arms consist of 17,000 Spanish rifles and 1,000,000 cartridges and are held, according to de Kay, as security for money due to him from the Mexican Government,
PORTUGAL.Trouble with the Polieia Segnranca do Estado is reported. Many agents went, revolver in hand, to the office of the Chief of Police (Captain Campos Eego) and threatened, if he did not resign there and then, to shoot him and bomb the building. Under duress the chief resigned. The ground of tho mooting is that the men are all Democrats and the Chief is a Liberal. The Government is dismissing aud replaciug the mutineers.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES.NORWAY.Communist and Revolutionary Activities.A meeting of Norwegian and Swedish revolutionaries was held on August 14th at the Peace Monument at Charlottenburg on the Norwegian-Swedish border. Tranmael was one of the principal speakers. It is said that the main object of the meeting was to perfect an understanding between revolutionary Norway and Sweden and thoroughly to co-ordinate revolutionary policy. Tranmael said that the fight for the workshops could be divided into three stages, the first of which has already been won by the Trade Uniou movement. These are : 1, influence, 2, control by labour of work decided on ; and 3, decision by labour as to what shall be done and how. A Soviet system must be formed to attain the second and third stages.The Communists recently sent representatives to the naval port of Horten, to agitate for Communism. Here permission to hold a big open-air meeting was refused and naval ratings generally seem to have taken little notice of their visitors. At a meeting at the local Folkets Hus, Eugene Olaussen outlined Communistic fighting methods. It appears that a general meeting, of the Trades Unions will be called soon, at which withdrawal from the Amsterdam International aud affiliation to the Moscow International will be insisted upon. If the lock-out is used to enforce reductions when various industrial agreements lapse in the autumn, labour must take over the workshops, forcibly if necessary. Olaussen declared that arms were being obtained, to meet force by force. Workmen were advised to study the business methods of their employers and to report anything likely to serve the forthcoming Communist management.There are reports that Communists and Syndicalists alike have started a campaign of agitation among teachers in the national schools. The object is to spread Communism among the young ; the teachers in the senior boys&apos; classes are especially aimed at. This campaign is being carried out in fertile soil, for 50 per cent, of Norwegian school teachers have socialistic, if not revolutionary, leanings on account of their poor pay and consequent economic difficulties.Several Norwegian Communist leaders, including Scheflo and Tranmael, are said to be conscious or unconscious tools of the Anarchist International. Syndicalists aud Anarchists in Norway are now in tacit union ; Christiania and Ejukan are the main centres. The chief execu-tive centre of the Anarchist International is in Paris ; the main intelligence and courier clearing-houses are in Berlin and Amsterdam.It is reported from various sources that Tromso is at present, an important Bolshevik revolutionary clearing-house. The courier service runs through Murmansk via. Vardo to Tromso.   Captain Bochowsky
directs this centre. As has already been stated, the Russian Soviet has timed an attempt at Norwegian and, if possible, Scandinavian revolution for the late autumn of this year.Recent ambiguous statements in the extremist press may plausibly be interpreted as incitements to the workers to obtain explosives. &quot; Social Dcmokraten&quot; has contained an advertisement calling for offers of con-tracts for blasting work this is probably a method of getting bold of explosives.A curious development of Communist activity is reported from Christiania, where the local revolutionary party is trying to sell to the upper classes small red flags bearing the Soviet Star, on the&apos;under-standing that their possession will guarantee the holders against personal attack or looting when revolution or attempted revolution takes place. This scheme is admittedly one to make a little money, and has slender prospects of success.The Russian Trade Agreement.It. was reported at the beginning of August that the Norwegian Government had accepted in all its essentials the draft commercial agreement prepared by the Norwegian Delegation and the Russian Delegation at Stockholm. The Government was later reported to have telegraphed to Stockholm that Kerjentseff might come to Christiauia to sign the Commercial Treaty if he had full authority. The terms of the treaty will, almost certainly give the russian representatives some measure of diplomatic rights. The Conservative Press is criticising the agreement which implies do facto recognition of the Soviet. It is deplored that the Government has not obtained recognition of Norwegian compensation claims amounting to about 300,000,000 kr. for Norwegian property in Russia seized by the Bolsheviks.The Transmission of Russian Propaganda.The recent removal of the ban on the import of Russian literature into Norway appears to extend also to the export of such matter. The only check now existing in Norway against the sending of Russian propaganda literature to England is the unwillingness of the shippiug companies to involve themselves in difficulties in England. This attitude is annoying Folkets Has which may conceivably, by agitation on the ground that the companies have no longer any right to interfere, succeed in removing this difficulty.Miscellaneous.It is stated that the Employers&apos; Federation intend to make con-siderable reductions in the rates of pay for skilled mechanics. These reductions are to be : for first class mechanics 25 per cent, at once and 15 per cent, on January 1st next; for second class mechanics, 20 per cent, at once and 10 per cent, on January 1st.It appears that in the near future the Norwegian Seamen and Fire-men will undoubtedly follow the example of their British comrades, and break away from the transport workers. The Norwegian Engineers&apos; Union has expressed its willingness in such case to form an alliance with the seamen and firemen.One of the Finnish representatives on the Finnish-Norwegian Boundary Commission is reported to be Lampio, Finnish Consul at Vardb, who is alleged to be in Bolshevik pay aud a most undesirable individual politically. He has managed to conceal Ins sentiments and. activities from the Norwegian authorities,
The notorious Captain Bochowsky appears to be patrolling the Norwegian coast on a Soviet ice-breaker. He visited &quot;Vardii on the pretence of making contracts for the sale of fish, but he made no big contract to the disappointment of the fishermen. He ascribed his failure to the attitude of the Norwegian Government. Early in July Bochowsky received 50,000 kr. from Klishko. The money was sent to Vardci, for buying fish or for propaganda purposes.SWEDEN. Communism on the Defensive.The Communist Party has made a remarkable change of front. Frederick Strom, who has persistently derided Parliamentary methods, has now urged the Communists to make common cause with the Moderate Socialists at the coming elections. Strom confesses that the working classes have been beaten back to a position of defence. The action seems to be the result of pressure by the extremists who have induced the party to decide that the Stockholm section should vote under the name of the Communist Party and put up as candidates only thorough-paced Communists.The disaster in Russia has had an effect and it is thought that the workers in general will not vote Communist. The more moderate Communists share the prevailing scepticism about the Russian experiment, and see little hope of early revolution.A police report on the Communist plot divulges that Thun, one of the suspects, was engaged in 1919 in recruiting unemployed unmarried workmen for a so-called &quot;Swedish battalion,&quot; which was to support the Finnish Reds hi the event of a renewed attempt at revolution. The scheme faded away owing to the absence of instructions from Stockholm. Wanhainen, one of Thun&apos;s associates, was engaged in organising arms depots, and in aiiti-military propaganda. The great body of the workers are feebly interested in the affair, and sympathy with the men affected is non-existent outside the Communist Party.The Seamen&apos;s Strike over.Firemen and sailors have resumed work with 20 per cent, reduction of their wages. Only the leader, Grip, was for a continuance of the fight, and he was obliged to surrender to the majority. During the strike many sailors broke with their union and signed on, vowing that they would never pay another penny to the union again. Their keenest present desire is to be rid of Grip. Grip is a young man who has never been to sg!l  is or sailor. Most of the members of the Union resent Grip&apos;s rather dictatorial methods, and are hinting that it is high time he was sent about his business. Grip has Communist sympathies, and when the Firemeu&apos;s Union came to an agreement with the shipowners, he started a campaign with the object of forcing the sailors to strike. His propaganda, however, had little effect.The firemen themselves were never unanimous in their demands, and the strike was never popular. A considerable minority voted against the strike, and were willing to agree to 20 per cent, reduction of wages. The shipowners wanted a 30 per cent, reduction, but after a time agreed to 20 per cent. The majority of the firemen, who know nothing of social problems, however, voted for the strike, which continued. The firemen know little of the administration even of their own union or of its financial standing.   The subscriptions are entirely absorbed by expenses,
Miscellaneous.Moscow has reported that from August 1st Stockholm harbour will be enlarged to meet the increased shipping which is expected in conse-quence of trade with Russia.Lomonosoff has denied the report that the Bolshevik Commercial Delegation is being transferred to Berlin.It is said that Kcrjentseff was not informed before his departure of the Swedish Governments objections to his return, and that a return visa was given him. He will not, however, come back to Sweden. Oschmiansky is for the moment head of the Bolshevik Delegation in Stockholm.Litvinoff has informed Vorovsky in Rome that Brukwitz has been refused a permit to enter Russia ; that the Soviet is allowing Swedes to enter the country only in exceptional cases &quot; in view of the indecent behaviour of the Swedish Government.&quot;A reduction of 10 per cent, on the substantive wages paid on January 1st of this year will be introduced in the Swedish iron works from September 12th. This will affect all the workmen who have no contract. It is the third reduction following upon previous reductions of 20 per cent, and 10 per cent.DENMARK. Progress towards a Trade Agreement.Moscow reported at the end of July that negotiations had been taking place between Kerjentseff and representatives of the Danish Government with regard to the conclusion of a trade agreement between Russia and Denmark, and that agreement had been reached on a number of points.KerjeutsefFhas since declared that negotiations have passed the official stags, but that a number of questions have yet to be discussed.Miscellaneous.The prevalence of unemployment is reported to be helping the Communists, who are steadily increasing in number.It is reported from Copenhagen that the Commissariat for Jewish undertakings in Soviet Russia has invited the Skandinavisk Jodisk Hjaelpekomite to send delegates to a conference in Moscow, which is to discuss the question of Jewish emigration to Europe and America.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. GERMANY.United Communists in Congress.The&apos;United Communist Party opened their second party congress at Jena op August 23rd. The party was faced with taking a definite attitude on the recent decisions of the Third International, and sharp divergences of opinion were revealed. The extremists evidently desired a heresy hunt, but their ardour was damped by a letter from Lenin, in which, according to the &quot;Daily Herald,&quot; the &quot; majestic personality&quot; of that tyrant appeared. Adopting a pontifical pose Lenin censured the extremists on both sides. He criticised Radek for attempting to convey the impression that the party which criticised the March rebellion had been totally defeated at the Moscow Congress, and then, turning impartially to Levy, described him as an intellectual anarchist who mustO   15035 B
be expelled if he contiiuiod an agitation to justify bis breach of discipline. The problem before the Congress was, Lenin maintained, that of preparing means for.winning over the majority of the organised workers of Germany to Communism. This could not be clone by the Parliamentary democratic method, but by intensive propaganda in the trade unions aud the existing organisations of workers. This accords with the present policy of the Third International and with the general temper of the advanced workers in Germany, who recognise that revolution is not at hand, and that the next offensive must be preceded by the penetration and ultimate capture of the trade unions. But it is curious at a time when, in England, Moscow has ordered the submission of the Red Trade Union International to the Communist Party.Much time was given to party stocktaking. The Central Committee vehemently denies that the party is declining and now numbers only 160,000 members. The Committee puts the membership at a little over 300,000 ; there are in addition about 50,000 unemployed members who are unable to pay subscriptions. But the discussion on tactics made it abundantly clear that moral has declined and that it is doubtful if the party is able to fight in earnest. The party is at present divided into three groups, differing on how to attain the conquest of the trade unions. One group, probably the ablest, follows the clever but unauthorised leadership of Paul Levy, and looks with suspicion on the Executive of the Moscow International and its pretensions to govern the universe. The second group, the strongest at the Congress, is led by Wagner, and follows a policy of action, fearing that unless something is done soon, the masses will sink into a slough of apathy The class conscious and desperate elements in the great cities are behind Wagner. There is finally the group led by the veteran Klara Zetkin. Zetkiu is seeking to bring about a reconciliation between the followers of Wagner aud those of Levy. She is inclined to temporise, though she does not condone passivity. She preaches that Europe must be ripe before the workers can come into power. The great problem before the Communists is to rouse the workers to action without offending their feelings and making-theni think that action has beeu ordered from Moscow. That idea has bseu prevalent since the failure of the March rising.The resolutions finally accepted appear on the surface to indicate that the Communists believe that Germany is nearing a social upheaval. The Left Wing profess that they cau exploit the resentment at the impending heavy taxation and the fight for a wage standard, which is threatened by the rise of prices, to win over the local trade councils and provincial branches of the Majority Socialist parties to direct action. The Congress demanded the imposition of all the taxation caused by the sanctions and reparations on the propertied classes ; a rise in wages of 100 per cent. ; and the control of production by the workers&apos; councils, as put forward by the trade union officials during the Kapp coup, but shelved; ever since.The police kept a watchful eye on the congress aud especially ou the foreigners who attended it. Raids were made, but the result of them has-not yet been divulged.The Split in the Communist Ranks.It is now evident that a definite split in German communism has occurred. The Communist Labour Party broke away from the Third International in July, when a heated scene was followed by the expulsion of the party delegates from Russia. The sequel was a secret meeting at which the Communist Labour Party decided to lose no opportunity of attacking the Third International.   To this end a special
120party meeting is to be held in Berlin on September 11th, when an attempt will be made to found a new International, which all national groups, restive under the lash of Moscow, will be invited to join, as will also the groups and organisations which have not joined the Third International. One line of attack will be the distribution of propaganda designed to show that the Russian Communists surrendered to the demands of the peasants. The first expenses a sum of 620,000 marks for propaganda literature is mentioned are apparently to be met from reserve funds, and help from dissatisfied foreigners is suggested, though this is unlikely to be very great.The Communist Labour Party has also defined its attitude towards the Soviet. If the Soviet Government comes forward as protagonist of the proletarian revolution, the party will support it with active solidarity ; should the Soviet Government appear as advocate of the bourgeois revolution, the party will just as actively light against it. This decision is said to have so far placated the Third International that it affects to consider that the K.A.P.D. has not formally withdrawn from the Third International.The Communists and Upper Silesia.Bolshevik plans in Upper Silesia were mentioned in the &quot; Review &quot; for July. Three independent groups were apparently to be concerned with the organisation of propaganda. Prague mainly organises pro-paganda on the spot, and for this purpose detaches an operating subsection to Breslau ; the Russian section of the German Communist Party in Berlin is charged with undermining the German formations by propaganda ; and the Silesian subsection of the Section for Propaganda has to bring its influence to bear among the troops of the Allied Powers. The last-named group is probably a branch of the Mannheim Central, which spreads propaganda among the troops of occupation and has subsections in Silesia and temporarily in East Prussia. The West European Secretariat for Propaganda is informed that it must have no hesitation in using the Soviet Embassy for purposes of communication  an indication that the Soviet Government and the Third International work in collusion on the Upper Silesian question.Kopp has been instructed by Moscow to watch events in Silesia very closely and to keep the Soviet informed of affairs. Larin (not the notorious Communist of that name), Schneerson, and Pipper, who are employed by Kopp, belong to the military Chresvychaika, to which department Upper Silesia has been assigned. These men maintain direct communication with Polish and German Communists in Upper Silesia, and with the central office for propaganda of the West European Secretariat of the Third International. All money for Communist propa-ganda, on which the Soviet has so far spent over 20,000,000 Polish marks, goes through their hands. Moscow sees a chance in Silesia of settling accounts with Poland.The Red plans seem, however, to have failed. It is stated in explanation, that the peasants desired peace at any price, that the German insurgents were hostile to the idea of Communism or even Republicanism, and that the propaganda agents were unsuitable. Wager, the emissary of the Western European Secretariat, who investigated the matter, reported that it was impossible to establish any Soviet military organisations in Upper Silesia. He is reorganising the propaganda centres and basing them all on Cracow. The present object of the Communists is to control and exploit dissatisfaction,0   16935 c
The Russian Communists;The Russian group, numerically the strongest of the foreign Coin-munist groups in Berlin, has for chief task to watch the activities of tho counter-revolutionary groups in Germany. The Soviet Mission is greatly interested in the struggle in Ukrainian circles between the adherents of Skoropadsky aud of Colonel Poltawetz-Ostranitza. The -Hungarian group consists of 27 members, including Stefan Leiter, the murderer of Count Tisza. Its influence is considerable, and it employs numerous agents to collect information as to tho activities of German and Hungarian Government departments.Communism: General.Three persons named Yaroshenko, Ysif, aud Marchenko are said to have been sent by the Executive of the Third International to Germany to keep in touch with the French Communists.Dr. Curt Geyer, Diiwell, and Waldemar have been expelled from the Communist Party for contributing to Paul Levy&apos;s newspaper &quot; LTnser Weg.&quot;The Communists in the Ruhr are reported to be organising a Eed Army for a new &quot; Putsch &quot; to take place at latest in October. The central organisation is at Halle. A simultaneous movement is to begin from east to west across the Balkans.The illegal Bezirks Directorate of the United Communist Party is said to be daily increasing its activity in Northern Bavaria. The methods employed for the organisation of the Red Army in Bavaria accord with instructions issued from the Berlin Centre. Illegal organisa-tions in the district of Wurtemberg are also said to be in rapid preparation, and training corps for United Communist leaders have been formed.A Communist Committee of three persons is said to exist in Berlin, which has a very strong influence on all matters connected with the Soviet regime. This committee works independently, behind the backs of the official and leading members of the Soviet Republic and the Third International. The only member of the committee who is known is a Jew, Joseph Steinberg, a friend of Radek and Vorowsky.A fresh indication of the decay of Communism is provided by the election of representatives for the meeting of the Metal Workers&apos; Union, which is to take place in Jena in September. The Metal Workers have always been strongly radical and more obedient to Moscow than any other body of workers in Germany. Now Majority and Independent Socialists have combined against the Communists and have in almost every case obtained a victory. The Communists seem to have been successful only at Dresden.The Soviet Delegation.The Trade Mission has bought a house ou the lutzow Ufer, Berlin, and now calls itself &quot; Bevollmiichtigte Vertretung des Kommissariats fiir Aussenhandel.&quot; This bureau directs all espionage work and propaganda, and employs agents of all nationalities, including two Irishmen. The names of these men are given, doubtfully, as Fred Cowan and William Take.It was reliably stated early ih August that Victor Kopp had finally resigned his post as head of the Soviet Delegation in Berlin and had returned to Moscow. Krestinsky, formerly People&apos;s Commissary for Finance, who was expelled from Bavaria, bus been appointed to succeed Kopp in charge of the diplomatic -work of the Mission.    Krestinsky is an
irreconcilable Communist who was mainly responsible for the national-isation of tlio Russian Co-operative movement. It is suggested that his task is to ascertain how far the present situation and public feeling in Germany may be used to stimulate Communist action by oxploiting disappointment at possible decisions on Upper Silesia and possibly the sanctions, and to seize any opportunity of making bad blood between Great Britain and France. Krestinsky has been in the past an official of the Communist International,Trade Relations with Russia.Differences of opinion revealed themselves in the German Foreign Office during the negotiations for a trade agreement with Soviet Russia. The majority argued that the Treaty was useless as the Bolsheviks had no money to pay for supplies ; the minority that the Bolsheviks could give such privileges in exploiting Russia as no other Government could give. The sole reason for signing the Treaty was, it is said, to prevent England monopolising trade with Russia. The Government had hoped to obtain mining concessions in exchange for goods an end to which Hugo Stinnes particularly worked but the Russian famine has upset all the plans of the financiers, who are adopting a waiting attitudeHilger, the German representative in Moscow, has reported that the feeling in Russia was entirely pro-German, and Germany should profit by it. Credit must be given.; concessions should be made to the Soviet in the question of diplomatic and consular representatives in Germany and official diplomatic relations should be resumed. Hilger did not think that the present moment favoured the colonisation of Russia by German peasants. He advised the immediate establishment of ten German consulates.The various co-operative societies and companies interested in trade with Russia, have combined in an association called &quot; German-Russian Association for fostering and promoting mutual commercial relations.&quot; The best known business men in Germany head the Association, which lias behind it commercial undertakings with an immense capital. The firms concerned work with the Soviet representatives and for Soviet Russia. They intend to capture the Russian market, both at present and also in the event of a revolutionary change in Russia.The &quot;Novy Mir&quot; has published details, professedly authentic, regarding the milliard mark fund- assigned by the Soviet for the purchase abroad of manufactured articles to be exchanged for grain in those parts of Russia which have escaped famine. It states that a considerable part of these orders were to be placed iu Germany, whose industry was more adapted to the needs of the Russian population. For this purpose the German Government has been asked to admit specialists and to supply fresh premises. It is hinted that if all the orders cannot be executed in Germany, they may be placed mainly in England.The Standing of Hugo Stinnes.Competent opinion, judging that the greatest possible concentration of capital is the first essential for a healthy carrying on of big business, is predicting that Stinnes&apos; policy of dividing up capital will entail the ultimate collapse of his enterprises. It is pointed out that this policy renders impossible the carrying out in the long run of economic projects without the help of extensive bank loans.   Now that Stinnes&apos; scheme for0 2
gaining ascendency over, the Hamburg-Amerika line through amalga-mating with its own shipping line has failed, tho Stinues line has become an extremely unprofitable venture. It is reported that the Government has decided to iutervoue, in view of the injury likely to be caused to German interests at large through an economic struggle between tho Harriman (to which the Hamburg-Amerika line belongs) and Stinnes shipping groups.Economists see a second dangerous stroke in Stinnes&apos; participation in the Alpine Montane Gesellschaft. As no revival of Austro-Czech commercial relations has yet set in, and as Stinnes has gained no firm footing in Czecho-Slovakia, the Alpine Montane Gesellschaft is practically eating up its own resources. French intervention has prevented Stinnes from obtaining the coal necessary to run those works, but he has now acquired an independent source of supply by the purchase of the Witkowitz mines in Czecho-Slovakia. Stinnes&apos; political connections with the officers centring round Ludendorff are also hampering his industrial and business plans. Stinnes has no bright prospects in connection with Russian reconstruction work. The German-Russian shipping lines to Petrograd have slipped out of his hands, and he seems to be practically excluded from the reconstruction of the Petrograd metal industry. The failures may be in great measure attributed to the financial support which Stinnes is lending to the Russian monarchists. His opposition to Rathenau has caused the Stinnes enterprises to take second place in the reconstruction work of Northern France. Of late Stinnes has modified his attitude, and is willing to co-operate, but he cannot overtake his competitors.Following upon his turning out of the board of the Hamburg-Amerika line, Stinnes has been cast out by the German-African line on the ground that he has the controlling interests in competing concerns. His place has been taken by the directors of the Haniel industrial group, com-competitors of Stinnes in the coal, iron, and engineering world. Stinnes now has control only of the Hamburg Transport Company.Stinnes&apos; activities in the Succession States include a scheme for the wholesale buying up of securities and property of watering places. Arrangements have been left in the hands of German elements in Czecho-Slovakia. The plan for the amalgamation, of the Wittkowitzer Works with the Stinnes group is reported to have fallen through owing to the possibility of interference by the Czecho-Slovak Government, especially in the way of taxes on foreign capital.The ex-Hetman Skoropadsky is reported to have concluded an agree-ment with Stiunes, who has advanced 2,000,000 marks to Skoropadsky so that the latter may attempt to re-establish his power in Galicia and Bukovina. Skoropadsky has promised in return a series of mining concessions.An Indian named Desai, who manages the Berlin branch of A. Jeevanjee &amp; Co., a Bombay firm, recently proposed to Stinnes that he should combine with Jeevanjee &amp; Co. for the purpose of buying Indian raw materials for German industries and for flooding the Indian market with German goods. Stinnes was unwilling to buy raw materials owing to the unsteadiness of prices, but was willing to pour out German goods, especially machinery. He stipulated that Jeevanjee &amp; Co. must prove that the firm was well organised with branches throughout India, and that it had a strong press behind it, able to counteract any action by the Indian Government. As Jeevanjee &amp; Co. have not many branches in India, Desai sought to enlist the interest of another Indian firm. Desai consulted von Wosendonck, notorious during the war for his connection with German-Indian conspiracies, ou the matter of the Press,
and was advised that any paper over which Joevanjee might obtain influence should put itself on the side of the Constitutional Party. Stinnes has in the meantime arranged for the appointment of Jeevanjee &amp; Co. as sole agents in India of the Sieniens-Halske Co., of Berlin.Indian and Oriental Intrigues,During his last short stay in Berlin Enver Pasha is said to have busied himself in organising a pan-Islamic committee with headquarters in Berlin, and a branch at Lausanne for Egyptian pan-Islamic propa-ganda. Early in August Enver was reported to have arrived in Switzerland, travelling with a German passport under the name of Doctor Blei.Dr. Prabhakar has been in charge of the Berlin Indian Committee during the absence of the Nationalist Delegates in Mosow. The representatives of the Indian Section of the West European Secretariat for Propaganda of the Third International are said to be named Johnson, Wright, Black, and Nicholson. Nothing more is known of them, but it is supposed that they may be in Moscow.Information received in Berlin goes to show that the Indian agitators have, under pressure, accepted Bolshevism as the only possible organisa-tiou which can be introduced into the new state of India, and have pledged themselves to further Bolshevism throughout the world. Moscow refused to help under any other conditions, but agreed, as a concession, that the terms of the agreement should remain secret in order to prevent a split in the Indian Nationalist movement. It has, however, become known. Moscow appears to have decided that the time has come for action in India, and Chatto intends to organise an Indian National Congress. A propaganda campaign, subsidised by the Soviet, is to follow. In this connection efforts are to be made to win the support of some reputable German newspaper.Heramba Lai Gupta, who is back in Berlin from Moscow, believes that India must reach Communism through Nationalism, and be has advised Bhupen and Chatto, who are staying in Moscow, not to agree to terms which would force them to carry out all Soviet orders with regard to India.   They should remain free to make their own choice.Of tho three Egyptian parties in Berlin, that led by Dr. Eloui and Shekib Arslan is the most violently nationalist. There are 40 to 50 Egyptian students in Berlin, most of them wealthy Nationalists.At a Pan-Islamist Conference recently held in Berlin two Russian delegates one of them, Krestinski, the new head of the Soviet Trade Delegation pointed out that in the abseuce of arms use should be made of bacilli to inflict injury on the foreign garrisons and foreign population in the East, due precautions being taken to protect the local Com-munists. Inquiries are to be made as to the availability of the bacilli of typhus, cholera, &amp;c, and inquiries addressed to factories at Hochst and Frankfurt, where serum is produced in large quantities. Emir Shekib Arsalan reported that he had secured a large number of Blue Cross bombs. It was thought that all these, which were the latest thing in poison bombs, had been destroyed. The Pan-Islamist programme is directed specially against England, and envisages a Holy War if necessary.The officers who are reported to be sent almost daily to Afghanistan via Russia belong to the Nationalist group of Germans and Turks, calling themselves &quot; The Group of the late von der Goltz Pasha.&quot; The leaders of this group live in Berlin, and Hugo Stinnes and his friends seem to be involved with them.    Some 600 to 700 first-class officers, topographists
and engineers, and about 2,000 workmen have been despatched. Tho engineers and workmen go largely to the mountain passes, and their work and propaganda are being supported by an abundance of German money.A Tale of Passports.There appears to be pretty conclusive evidence that the German and Esthouian authorities connive with the Russians lit assisting the secret-transit to Moscow of certain delegates. An Australian delegate, William Smith, arrived in Berlin with a passport to visit the United Kingdom, bearing no German visa. On presenting a letter from the Trades Hall Council, Melbourne, to the Passport Office in Berlin, he was granted a Russian visa on a separate sheet of paper, which was gummed upon the British passport, the Soviet official considerately indicating that the removal of this sheet would efface all trace of Smith&apos;s visit to Russia. The German Pass Office readily gave their visa on the gummed sheet, and the Esthoniaus followed suit. There is reason to believe that the Germans and Russians have been following this practice for some time, the German excuse being that the occupation of the Rhineland deprives them of effective control of foreign arrivals.Labour Questions.The Independent Socialists are said to be trying to foment a general strike on the left bank of the Rhine, with the object of preventing the despatch of troops to the Ruhr in case of complications in Upper Silesia.The trouble in the mining industry appears to be coming to a head. The owners insist on settlement on district lines, while the men demand one on a national basis, because of the rapid and general rise in the cost of living. The miners ask for an immediate increase of 12 marks a shift, but the owners refuse any further negotiation until the present agree-ments terminate.The 50,000 workers of Danzig have been out on strike. Wages in the city have not been increased since the war, the employers pleading the uncertain future of the city and the foreign military occupation as an excuse to postpone increases. An incident of the strike was the arrest of all the Communist members of the City Council during a sitting of of that body.The Government has decided that no unemployment pay may be given to workers who were employed iu an industry wholly or in part closed in consequence of a strike or lock-out. It is also to be withheld from persons thrown out of work in consequence of a strike breaking out in another industry or iu another industry suspended by reason of a lock-out, so long as the strike or lock-out is the preponderating cause of the unemployment.Miscellaneous.All the persons who took part in the seizure of documents at tho residence of Colonel Freyberg, SemenofPs representative, have been arrested.   The documents havo apparently been taken to Russia.It was reported early in August that John de Kay was either in Berlin or in one of the holiday resorts near the city. His financial position is very precarious, and access to Switzerland has been forbidden him by the Swiss authorities.Victor Kopp has been expressing the opinion that nothing will come of the negotiations between the British Cabinet and the Irish rebels, but that in the meantime the Sinn Feiners will be better supplied with ammunition.   Contraband goods for Sinn Fein are said to be carried
6n small steamships and motor boats to various ports in the West of Ireland.Herman Midler, the former German Chancellor, is reported to be engaged at present on preparatory work in connection with the Congress of tho Majority Socialists in September. He is expected beforehand to visit Switzerland, where ho will meet French Socialists, in particular Longuot, with whom he wishes to discuss the Silosian question.SWITZERLAND.Extremist Movements.The Communist counter-demonstrations organised on August 1st, the Swiss National Day, had little success. The most important display was at Basle.Humbert Droz told a meeting of Geneva Communists that he intended to return to Russia as soon as possible, as he had been appointed a member of the Secretariat of the Third International. Up to the present the German authorities had refused him a visa. He explained away Russia&apos;s deviations from Communism, and admitted that the Communist Party could not enforce its principles until the revolution was supported by the majority of the nations.A new French Communist daily, &quot; Avant Garde,&quot; which made its first appearance on May 1st, is said to cost 285 francs a day. It has only 652 subscribers. A new subsidy appears to have been received from Berlin, but the publishers have feeble hopes of the continuance of Russian help. Moscow has apparently decided that it does not get value for money in Switzerland, and that even a successful revolution there would make an insufficient impression on surrounding countries.The Swiss Socialist Congress, which meets in September at Lucerne, will have before it a motion to establish a Press Fund. Each member will be asked to subscribe 1 franc annually, the subscriptions going in subsidies to small Socialist organs and eventually to the establishment of a new newspaper. A rival scheme will also be presented for the amalga-mation of all the Socialist newspapers into one organ, capable of competing with any bourgeois journal.The President of the &quot; Groupe Socialiste Romand &quot; is one Robert Kohler, a postman employed at Zurich. The group co-operates with the revolutionary &quot; Clarte&quot; group, and is also in close relations with an anarchist group.The International Federation of uuemployed is reported to have no section in French Switzerland, but a section in Zurich, where it is patronised by the &quot; Workmen&apos;s Union.&quot; The Federation is in touch with, and receive orders from Soviet Russia ; it has branches in Italy, FYance, Germany, Switzerland, and England; its object is to prepare the unemployed for the World Revolution.The Co-operative Congress.The Tenth International Co-operative Congress, which has been held at Basle, rejected an amendment proposed by the Committee to the report recommending the Congress to leave vacant until the next meeting of the Central Committee the places to which Russia is entitled on the Central Committee. The Congress elected a new Central Committee, including Krassin and Dr. Polovtzeva as representatives of Russia. It was decided to make an attempt to establish international trade through co-operative channels and to formulate a scheme for an International Co-operative Bank.
The Eastern Agitators.There are reports that Mohammed Fahmi has been expelled from Switzerland for debt and misconduct, and lias gone to France.Ali Shemsi Bey is said to be conducting, in co-operation with Mohammed Fahmi and without great success, an active Zaghloulist propaganda among Egyptian students. The current of opinion is turning towards Adly Pasha.Krishnavarma, who was present at a lecture given some time ago at the Geneva University by Rabindranath Tagore, is said to have then renewed his offer to tho University of 20,000 francs for the founding of an annual Congress for the Independence of India.Miscellaneous.The well-known Anarchist Vera Zassoelitsj died in Switzerland a few weeks ago. Her principle exploit was the shooting, in 1878, of General Trepof, Commander of the St. Petersburg police.AUSTRIA.The Position of the Communist Party.At a committee meeting of the Communist Party, held during July, it was reported that the regular paying members were 16,824, including 2,444 women and excluding 3,460 members of the soldiers&apos; group. The unorganised adherents number about 20,000. Tomann, who reported on the general situation, stated that the time for an offensive was not yet ripe, but would come when the industrial crisis, signs of which were already apparent, became acute. Lohner proposed a resolution, which, in view of the absence of important members of the party, was not put to the vote, favouring the. adoption of a more moderate attitude towards the Social Democrats, especially by the party organ the &quot; Rote Fahne.&quot; This is an important indication that a &quot; right &quot; faction is being secretly formed within the party for the purpose of actively lighting the extre-mists (Putschists) and gradually transforming the party with a view to. ultimate re-fusion with the Social Democrats, on whom the Right hopes to exercise a radicalising influence. Not until Strasser (who has gone to Moscow as representative of the Moderates or Levites) returns will the secret constitution be finally drawn up and operations started. Frey, the party chairman, remains in Vienna.The financial difficulties under which the Party labours are sufficiently indicated by the latest general directions. These order the permanent reduction by one half of grants from party funds to various organisations, and prescribe the strictest economy.Berlin has intimated that no money can be expected during August, and, in addition, that all money at the disposal of the party, even if already allotted, is to be held at the disposal of Berlin. It.was probable that no salaries would be paid in Vienna during August.The directions also enjoin, strict discipline and obedience. The Soldatengruppe is called upon to carry out the instructions previously issued, with special vigour, and particularly to do all in its power to widen the breach between officers and men. The creation of Communistic factions among the Soldatenraete of the various barracks is to bo systematically worked for. The approaching period of serious unemploy-ment is looked upon as an excellent opportunity for agitation and action. The liaison service with Moscow is to be improved, the closest possible connection established with the party in Germany, Czecho-Slovakia, and Bohemia, and  special  attention directed to conditions  in   Hungary.
Tomann has, however, been warned by the police that any extension of agitation will result in the forcible dissolution of the party.Vienna as Propaganda Centre?It is reported that the first plan of transferring tho centre of Communist propaganda from Moscow to Vienna has not been carried out. Alexandrowski, the secretary of the Vienna Soviet Mission, has taken up an important position in Germany, and has been succeeded by one Klotz, who was imprisoned during the Russian-Polish war, but escaped. An agitator named Marian Frankel, a close friend of Leuin and Trotsky, has arrived in Vienna with schemes for creating disturbances among tho White Russians. The Soviet is said to be afraid of tho Paris and lieichenhall White Russian movement.Communism : Miscellaneous.Communist propaganda is active among the troops, especially at the Reunweg Barracks.The staff of the &quot; Freie Tribune&quot; (the organ of the &quot; Poale Zion &quot; group) is becoming the centre of the Viennese Communist Party.Contrary to expectation, Bronski Warshawski has returned to Vienna to take up his former duties.Wiener Neustadt is seeking to become the headquarters of the Communist Party for West Hungary.The Bolsheviks are said to have sent a Commission lo Austria, which is to negotiate with the Steyer-Skoda Works for the construction and fitting up of an artillery factory in the Urals. The works are said to have been granted extensive concessions.The Viennese Anarchists.The Viennese Anarchists appear to consist of two groups the Theoretical Anarchists and the Anarchists of Action. Tho Theorists have been organised by Pierre Ramns (really a Jew named Grossmann) ; they are anti-Bolshevik, pacific, and opposed to all violence. They call themselves &quot; Masterless Socialists,&quot; and are forming a settlement near Vienna, in which to put their theories into practice. The Activists have been organised ou a communist basis, forming a separate union within the Communist Party.Poale Zion.The Left Wing of Poale Zion in Vienna has now organised a Press Bureau, in conjunction with the Communists and with financial help from Moscow. The Bureau collects information from and for Moscow, and has started a Secret Intelligence Department, which has for one task to obtain information about the anti-Revolutionaries in Europe. Similar Intelligence Departments have been formed in Berlin, Stockholm, Lemberg, and Danzig.A Communist settlement has been founded at Wolfsberg, near Hugel-dorf, where a hundred Poale Zionists are being trained for propaganda work in Palestine.Another International.The Convention of Boot and Shoe Operatives and Saddlers, which has been meeting in Vienna, has founded a new international, embracing all workers in the leather industries. After heated discussion the Conven-tion decided to adhere to Amsterdam. The secretarial bureau of the new organisation starts work on January 1st, 1922 ; a new constitution is to be drafted and presented to the next congress.    .......   -
Communism discredited.The revelations of Engelbert Kucera have completely discredited the Communist Parly, which is in a state of collapse. Kucera, who was an Austrian prisoner of war and formerly Communist Commissary in Moscow, disclosed during July that the Communist leaders in Prague had been receiving bribes from Moscow, and, acting under instructions from Bela Kun, were working, not for Communism, but for the re-partition of Czecho-Slovakia in favour of Hungary. Internationalism has not yet killed patriotism, aud these statements, which seem to be true enough, have altogether demoralised the rank and file. The future for Communism is very dark. Much depends upon Smeral, who has managed to vindicate himself at Moscow, and much upon events in Russia and the changed attitude of Moscow to Czech Communism.Communist activity is, however, not altogether dead. The Party is said to have decided to work for the formation of a united German and Czecho-Slovak Communist Party on a centralist basis, without federalism and with a definite Communist programme ; also for the control of trade unions and for linking them with the International.The Communist parties of Yugo-Slavia and Czecho-Slovakia are also said to have plans, as yet unmatured, for uniting their activities and forming a private &quot; Slav Corridor &quot; oE their own. Prague and Kaschau would be headquarters, with au intermediary station in Vienna at the headquarters of the Czech Communist group there. There appear to be objections from the Austrian national point of view to the creation of separate Czech groups in Austria, and of Slovak groups on the acquisition of Western Hungary.Secret Committees are being organised by the Czech Communists under cover of the existing legal committees. These secret bodies, which have for function to stir up agitation and to spread propaganda, cover the official committees, which can avoid responsibility in the case of direct action. The secret committee automatically replaces any official committee rendered powerless by governmental action. The central secret committee in Czecho-Slovakia has 60 members and has no fixed seat.The Czecho-Slovak Communist Press Bureau started operations iu Prague during July. It was opened at the instigation of both the Czecho-Slovak and German Executive Committees of the Communist Party.The Juvenile Communists.The Juvenile Communist Associations in Czecho-Slovakia are reported to be affiliated to the Untersekretariat in Vienna. There are three of these associations tho League of Czech Socialist Juveniles, harmlessly active ; the League of Social Democrat Juveniles in the German-speaking territory, undisguisedly and aggressively Communist; and the League of Socialist Juveniles iu Slovakia, controlled by the Hungarian Communists and centred at Bratislava. The German organisation had become so dangerous by April of this year that the police made a number of arrests. A large increase in Communist juvenile literature has been observed.For their part the Juvenile Communists of North Bohemia have decided to form a new United Communist Juvenile organisation working with the Czech Communist Party. Anti-militarist progapanda is to be recommenced on a great scale.
The National Socialists.The present political disruption does not affect the Communists only The National Socialist Tarty seems to bo near death, and will probably be largely absorbed by tho Social Democratic Right. The leader of the Agrarian organisations of the National Socialists, deputy Uobry, has left (he party and declared the independence of his group, thereby endangering all the success attained among the Agrarian working classes. Dobry is now negotiating for joint action with the Agrarians and their Associations of Small Farmers. Other secessions are threatened. There is no foundation for the tales of a split between Agrarian members and the rest of tho National Democrat Party.Esperantists in Congress.The Czech police persistently maintain that no Bolshevik represen-tatives attended the Esperanto Congress held in Prague during the first week in August, and. that the Congress in no way cloaked Communist communication. No representative from Soviet Russia and no Germans were present. The French delegates included some teachers apparently with Communist leanings. The Congress passed a resolution in favour of the development of Ido, an improved form of Esperanto.The French Anarchist Esperantists managed to secure a majority for a change of name from &quot; Librerer Stelo &quot; to &quot; Sennacta Asocio Tutmondo &quot; (S.A.T.). A resolution was also passed, on French anarchist inspiration, that a central board should be created, which, later on, when the world has been converted to anarchism, will become the executive for world administration.Russian Activities.The Government has decided that business people wishing to treat with the new Soviet Commercial Mission can do so only through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or an office which is directed by the Czech Vice-Consul. Dr. Hillerson has gone to Moscow, after delegating all his powers to Mostoveuko. Mostovenko is already in touch with the Communist centre in Vienna. The new Mission is said to subsidise discreetly the separatist movement of Jehlicka and Unger, in Cracow, and to have been responsible for recent trouble and communist agitation in Sub-Carpathian Russia.Hillerson is said to have been conducting negotiations, fruitless so far, with the Skoda Werke and other munition factories for the supply of artillery and munitions to Soviet Russia. Prague believes that these negotiations merely cloak Hillcrson&apos;s real object, which is Bolshevik propaganda.Telegraphic communication between Czecho-Slovakia aud Soviet Russia has been established.Miscellaneous.Proposals are said to have been passed between Hugo Stinnes and Baron Rothschild, by whioh the Stinnes group will acquire a large interest in the Czecho-Slovak mining districts.A Communist employed in a munition factory, who was caught filling shell-caps with wadding instead of with explosives, admitted that the Communist leaders had issued instructions to this effect.The Czccho-Slovak Government is holding hostage Alexander Abramovich, alias Frantisek Zalewsky, the Third International propagandist, in the hope of exchanging him for Czech agents held
prisoners iu Moscow. Abrarnovicli was known in France as &quot;The Eye of Moscow,&quot; and it will be remembered that he and Klara Zetkin represented the Russian Communists at tho Congress of Tours.HUNGARY. Communist Plans and Propaganda.A marked increase in the postal circulation of Communist literature was observable during July, but police vigilance checked any possible success of this propaganda. As far as Communism is concerned things are very quiet. 117 officers have recently been removed from the Army under suspicion and are under special observation.Communists were reported to be planning to create trouble in the Western Komi tats during the period when these districts are being handed over to Austria, in order to discomfort and possibly discredit the Hungarian Government. A special West Hungarian Communist Section is working to recruit members amongst the workmen. Both Budapest and Moscow were solicited for propaganda, funds.It was reported at a secret meeting of the military Sub-Committee held in Moscow iu connection with the Congress of the Third Inter-national that at present 300 persons were actively spreading propaganda in Hungary. These were sufficient for necessary work, although more money was wanted for agitation among the soldiers. Moscow has devised a definite scheme for creating trouble in barracks in foreign countries.The Treaty concluded between Hungary and the Soviet obliges Hungary to release 400 persons and allow them to return to Russia. The Hungarian People&apos;s Commissaries of the Belli Kim regime are included. Russia will liberate Hungarian officers and interned civilians hitherto held prisoners.4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.The Famine.The famine is the dominating concern, not for Russia only, but for Europe. It is still difficult, in the absence of independent official , information, to measure the precise extent of the disaster. The numbers affected, as estimated alike by the Soviet and by foreigners in Russia, show discrepancies of millions. It is doubtful whether the Soviet itself possesses much reliable statistical information, so great has been social dissolution since the Bolsheviks came into power. It appears probable that the height of the crisis will be reached in December. Colonel Ryan, the Commissioner of the American Red Cross in the Baltic, has gone so far as to say that over 2,000,000 Russians will die of famine, despite all the help that the world can offer, and it is,questionable if there will be one Communist among them. The Soviet, meanwhile, is fighting the despair and disillusion of the starving peasants with propaganda  its only weapon. Thousands of Communists are being sent into the stricken districts to carry on propaganda for the Soviet Government. These agitators ascribe the miseries of Russia to Tsarist rule and civil war,.and predict that the Western Powers will exploit the famine in order to turn Russia into a sort of colony. Agitation seems at present to be chiefly directed against France.It became increasingly clear during August that the Soviet would accept relief only under its own terms and under its own control. The Soviet Government and the Soviet Press, as before, have cried, now for
help, and now against capitalist measures of relief. The Soviet itself knows that it can do nothing, except pass such derisive measures of relief as the freeing of the famine region from food taxes and suspending internal trade in farm produce. The frantic appeal against &quot; Tsar Famine &quot; issued during August ordered the workers to load 400 trucks per day with seeds &quot;for winter crops during the short time that remained till September. It was admitted that hitherto loading had reached only 60 trucks, and that the seeds purchased abroad would not arrive in time. Kameneff has since proclaimed that 10,000,000 poods of seed have reached the famine area.TyDical of the hatred which bites the hand that would feel it is the outburst in &quot;Pravda&quot; of August 13th, denouncing foreign schemes of relief as a cloak for intervention and the robbery of the last of Russia&apos;s wealth. &quot; If in return for your assistance you demand the political rights &quot; of tho Russian people besides gold, we may frankly tell you that for &quot; our gold we can buy bread more profitably without your &apos; humane &apos; &quot; intervention. However hungry the Russian people may feel, they &quot; have not yet lost their senses, and they can very well see the cruelty of &quot; the wolf and the cunning of the fox concealed under your mask of &quot; humbleness and wisdom.&quot; On the same day the Third International issued another inflammatory appeal, making reckless accusations of cheating and lying, and alleging- that a war of extermination is being jirepared. The workers of the world were asked to form independent relief committees, but no indication is vouchsafed as to how such relief is to be collected or administered. The French workers are asked to prevent the Government from unchaining a fresh war against Russia, the German workers to watch all movements coming from the West.If any proof were needed of the determination of the Soviet to reject any aid but its own, such proof is to be found in the arrest of the members of the Ail-Russian Famine Relief Committee this a few days after ample independent powers had been conferred upon it. Thus are illustrated the distrust and the obscure jealousies of the Kremlin. With this maybe coupled the candid avowals of &quot; Pravda,&quot; which declares : &quot; We cannot hope to help the starving with the food supplies received, for all these resources are exclusively required for the Red Army.&quot;The only pretext revealed for the suppression of the Ail-Russian Famine Relief Committee is the vague charge of &quot; counter-revolutionary activities.&quot; The population was already beginning to look to the Committee as the only hope of relief from their troubles, and it is hinted . that the Soviet Government saw in the Committee a body capable of taking up Government in the event of an overthrow of the present regime. There seems, in fact, to have been a rush of delegations and deputations to Moscow, beseeching the help of the Committee and ignoring the Soviet and its institutions. The latest reports state that the members of the Committee have been released, with the exception of the three leaders, F. A. Golovin, Dr. N. Kishkin, and Professor Prokopovitch. It is not improbable that the Committee was suppressed as an act of provocation by Litvinoff, aimed at Krassin, who may have seen in the Committee a chance of co-operation with the better classes and of building up little by little a coalition. Litvinoff will probably do his utmost to protect Mr. Hoover&apos;s mission. There is said to be complete agreement between Krassin, Lenin, Kamcneff, and Trotsky. The opposition comprises Tchitcherin, Litvinoff, and Djerjinsky.Meanwhile, whether the foreign supporters of the Soviet can stomach it or not, relief can only come from the capitalist world, whatever talk there may bo of an international proletarian loan. Mr. Hoover&apos;s activities are voluntary, and concern the feeding of children only, and the
Soviet will only honour its guarantees as long as it is expedient to do so. Dr. Nansou&apos;s agreement with, tho Soviet authorities will prove abortive. His scheme appears to consist of the appointment of a committee of two, which, presumably, is to sit iu Petrograd and supervise relief, one of tho representatives to be a Bolshevik and tho other a nominee of Dr. Nansen. As to the local machinery, Dr. Nansen&apos;s personnel will also co-operate with the Soviet bodies. Further, Dr. Nansen does not seem to have been provided with any definite proposals regarding security for the ten millions sterling credit for too years at 6 per cent, which he is asking from the Allied Governments at the request of the Bolsheviks, nor is ho furnished with any statemetit regarding the attitude of tho Bolsheviks to their obligations to the Allies in respect of Russians indebtedness. The Soviet will undoubtedly argue that, being the principals responsible for the repayment of the loan, they are the people mainly entitled to participate in the distribution. On this point, either the negotiations will fail before they fructify, or, while the contract is in- operation after the main portion of the relief has reached Russia, the guarantees may be cancelled by reason of the international body having failed to carry out some portion of the agreement.Dr. Nansen has now gone to Paris, where he will meet the members of the All-russian Famine Commission and discuss with them his plan for dealing with the Russian famine before proceeding to Geneva for the Assembly of the League of Nations. He wishes also to place his agreements before Mr. Lloyd George and the French Government.The Delegation is under the impression that the British Government, especially the Premier, realises the necessity of affording assistance to Russia, and will be forced to find means to do so. They believed that Russia has no reason to hurry or propose other forms of security, and that it is essential to insist on the recognition of Russian state bonds.Further, it is thought that the offer of the Children&apos;s Relief Committee to arrange for Russian children to stay in England should be accepted as giving Englishmen the opportunity of knowing Russian children and of helping them.Gorviu and another person are in Riga, explaining that their main object is to find out the attitude of the Soviet towards the International Red Cross aud other relief organisations, and to attempt to secure the Soviet&apos;s request for relief credits from various governments. According to Gorvin the International Relief Credit Committee still has seven million pounds unallocated. He assigned two million from neutrals aud the balance from the British, which he hopes can be diverted to the Soviets, if they request it. A letter has been sent to Litvinoff outlining the above funds and emphasising that in their distribution Soviet machinery would be employed. . This offer of assistance through Soviet organisations, though it is very intangible, will probably help to consolidate LitvinofPs position, which is perhaps what they&apos; desire.The arrival in Riga of a party of about 12 representatives of various governments to discuss the means of assisting Russia bad already been notified. It was then considered that thoy were likely to make complications.The Political Position.According to a Stockholm newspajier, Lenin recently told a meeting of the People&apos;s Commissaries that the situation was very dangerous, and that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Government to
maintain its power until the winter. The Commissaries resolved to ask for help from abroad in order to save the people from famine, to convene a congress at which all the opposition parties would be represented, and to send delegations to all foreign countries with the task of endeavouring to enter into relations with the Government of those countries. The heads of these delegations are Professor Bekhtereff for France, England, and Spain; M. Lunaeharsky for Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and Belgium ; and M. Yoffe for Switzerland, Italy, Czecho-Slovakia, and Poland.The peasants do not scruple to admit that they were better off under the old regime, but it is very hard to shake them from their apathy. The Soviet authorities are probably justified in their belief that they have secured the bulk of hidden arms. The peasants are organised locally, but no larger and effective organisation exists. Much anti-British feeling is apparent. The Bolsheviks have taught the masses that England is responsible for the blockade and for much of their suffering ; the signing of the Trade Agreement is considered an admission of Great Britain&apos;s defeat. The other side is inclined to regard the agreement as a betrayal of the &quot; White Cause.&quot; If the worst happens, the Soviet leaders will probably try to hold the larger towns and industrial centres, and let the rest go temporarily. The people who prefer authority of any kind, however bad, to anarchy, may continue to support the Soviet:The position of the people in Petrograd, exhausted with hunger and privation, is reported to be tense. The &quot; non-Party &quot; movement is pre-dominaut, and one of its organisations, the &quot; Military League,&quot; is preparing to take over the maintenance of order when the Soviet regime collapses. The attitude of the organisation is generally inde-pendent, and they refuse any relations with the West and with the Russian emigres, declaring that any support or assistance by the Tatter is quite unnecessary. They are well supplied with printing-presses, which allow them to circulate propaganda. A marked exodus of Jews has been taking place.Abandoning Ship.The flight of Soviet intellectual elements continues. Besides this, many Soviet administrators are constantly coming and going between Russia and the Border States, evidently on special missions for the Soviet Government. Simultaneously various banks have been established abroad for the sole purpose of carrying out financial operations for the Soviet. These activities may indicate that the Sovitt is preparing to transfer the centre of its activities from Moscow and Petrograd to the West, and is establishing a financial base beforehand. Efforts are being made to induce the various Socialist and revolutionary elements to participate in this transfer. Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries are being amnestied, and the so-called non-party elements are being, if possible, induced to occupy posts in the administration. A quite probable development may bs the introduction of non-Communist socialists into the Government, under the guise of a coalition cabinet consisting of representatives of all labour parties standing on the platform of the Revolution. The Bolsheviks may in time be content to abandon Russia to the Social Revolutionaries and concentrate their energies on new bases, tempting the Red Army by promises of new plunder.It was reported last month that the Soviet had acquired banks in Warsaw and Bucharest. The Warsaw bank may be a banking agency firm, owned by a shady individual named Volyansky and chiefly occupied in selling lottery tickets and Polish premium bonds.
The Collapse of Communism.Determined to sa,ve something from the wreck, tho Communists are jettisoning principle after principle. A decree orders house property in towns to be returned to the former owners if the latter are willing to accept. The sale and purchase of house property is made legal. Another decree recognises as private property furniture and other movable property in houses, and declares that it can be sold and transferred at the owners&apos; will. Co-operative unions and private citizens have been given the right to build houses in municipal territory. They will be guaranteed non-eviction.The Soviet is now considering the reintroduction&quot;of a general com-pulsory levy on all agricultural produce. The food tax has failed completely, the peasauts, even in districts where the crop is satisfactory, refusing to part with a tithe of their grain. A decree is also to be issued making the cultivation of all land in the famine area compulsory, and troops will bo sent to enforce this decree. The ban on the con-sumption of alcoholic drink is to be removed. The sale of wines containing not more than 17 per cent, alcohol is permitted, at a tax of 15,000 roubles on each bottle. The Soviet is also reported to be seriously considering the reintroduction of the vodka monopoly. Free education is also at an end. From now onwards all education, including elementary, must be paid&apos;for. The free transport of passengers on the railways has also been abandoned, and fares at something like commercial rates are being charged, at an increase of 2,500 per cent.The Religious Revival.Various reports, supported by the evidence of Englishmen who have lately returned from Russia, emphasise the importance and extent of the religious revival. Hunger and misery have strengthened the reaction against Bolshevik and Atheist doctrines, and the Orthodox Church is coming back to its own, in town and country alike. Many priests are said to be telling their people that their misery will only cease when God again gives them a Tsar.Norwegian foreign missionaries, for their part, report that Russia is in a state of religious hysteria. Religious hatred is concentrated against the Jews, who are murdered daily in all parts of Russia, and whoso houses are sometimes demolished, their sites ploughed, and salt strewn in the furrows. In their misery the wretched people are having recourse to the black art.The reports of a religious revival, unpleasant though some of its manifestations may be, add force to the growiug opinion that after the approaching collapse of the Communist regime there will be an almost inevitable call for the Patriarch Tikhon to become the spiritual and political head of Russia. There is a universal cry for a personal dictator, and no Russian except the Patriarch is known and obeyed throughout the country, and has the organisation for keeping his authority and influence alive.The Divisions in the Third International.So sharp is the division of opinion between the Western delegates ou the one hand aud the Russian and Eastern delegates on the other that an internal split among the members of the Third International appears to be inevitable a split which will be repeated in the various national Communist parties.
The Left extremists are disappointed because of the decision to stop active operations and to concentrate on propaganda ; the foreign repre-sentatives complain that tho Executive Committee has misled them as to conditions in Russia ; and the agents working abroad are annoyed that unlimited funds are no longer forthcoming for their propaganda of class hatred. The shortage of funds is, indeed, the real reason for the decision of the International.The representatives of the Western European Bureau are said to have decided to call a new congress, in which the French will take a leading part, and the Communists of Western Europe may not improbably form themselves into an independent organisation. The Russians insist that a revolution must be started immediately in Europe ; the Western European Communists consider that a revolution is at present iinpos-sible, and have no wish to sacrifice themselves for internal affairs in Russia.It is clear that coutact, which ia now weakening, between the International and the Communist organisations in Western Europe was kept up exclusively through the Bolshevik representatives abroad. This order will continue for the future also. Moscow is said to be placing increasing reliance on the Alliance of Youth which, according to Trotsky, is not yet infected by opportunism and bourgeois spirit. It is hoped through the Alliance to introduce great activity into the workers&apos; movement in Western Europe.The more extreme Russian representatives of the International are, meanwhile, said not to be averse from war ou one or more border countries, in the hope of diverting the minds of the people from their present miseries.The Red Trade Union International has issued a manifesto, in which it sets itself &quot; the immediate task of uniting all really revolutionary fighters in the formation.&quot; A sop is thrown to syndicalists, who are told that new mutual concessions will be necessary, but that they must remain in the International and strengthen it if they wish to accomplish really revolutionary work.The Bed Army.Through the Press the Soviet is giving the impression that a new attack is being planned against Russia. This move may be set down to nervousness or interpreted as an attempt to prepare public opinion for an offensive by the Red Army. A circular to the leaders of the Red Army points out, however, that Russia has no aggressive imperialistic plans. The Red frontier guards on the Finnish frontier north of Petrograd have been considerably strengthened, and troops have been transported to the Murman district. The Finnish Geueral Staff, however, does not take the increase of Red. forces on the Isthmus very seriously, though they cannot explain the reason for it and are strengthening their frontier guards very considerably. Zinovieff has made a very inflammatory speech against Finland.The sixth and seventh Communist regiments, mainly composed of Poles, have been ordered to Smolensk, and the first and fourth Communist regiments, also largely composed of Poles, have been transferred to Minsk. These changes have been made in order to bring the Polish Red soldiers nearer to Poland, where they can more easily influence their fellow countrymen. Trotsky is said to be making a tour of inspection of the troops on the Polish-Russian front.Disquiet is, meanwhile, said to prevail in leading circles in Moscow at the receipt of strong notes from Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, and Poland, Q   15935 d
kpointing out the Soviet Governments breaches of the respective peace treaties.Trotsky has stated that the numerical strength of the Eed Army is three times smaller than it was eight months ago, and continues to decrease. The Bolsheviks are, however, increasing the number of military schools. Trotsky denies that Red troops are concentrated in the Caucasus and that Red Divisions are fighting for Mustapha Kemal.The Soviet Delegation at Helsingfors is said to have been informed that Brusiloff has disappeared with important documents and with part of his staff. The latest information places him in West Siberia, where he is organising a rising which the Army is joining.It was reported some time ago that the well-known General Kuropatkin had been implicated in a conspiracy against the Soviet Government and subsequently poisoned. It is now stated, however, that he was shot for refusing to proceed against below iu Siberia, and that General Leman has been appointed in his place.The Co-operatives return to Grace.At a Congress of Ceutrosoyus representatives in Moscow it was admitted that the failure of the harvest had frustrated the entire barter plan. Efforts were being made to counteract this, and the Soviet of People&apos;s Economy had already granted a certain increase in power to the Ceutrosoyus.The Soviet, in fact, is sparing no efforts to restore the co-operative movement, which it was at great pains to destroy two years ago. It has of late made repeated advances to the leaders of the Centrosoyus. The Moscow Centrosoyus leaders have, however, required, among other conditions, that a full amnesty be granted immediately to the members of the Russian co-operative societies at present in London, who have been sentenced in contumaciam by the Soviet Government to forced labour, and that they be permitted to return to Russia, that the right of the Centrosoyus to control without interference the Russian Co-operative movement be acknowledged, and that freedom of purchase and sale of goods, and the immediate abolition of the Government monopoly of foreign trade be recognised. The Soviet is reported to have accepted these conditions.The People&apos;s Commissariat for Finance assigned five milliard roubles for the month of July to the Central Workmen&apos;s Co-operative for the requirements of the Co-operatives.Khinchuk has been elected president of the new Board of Directors of the Centrosoyus.Krassin on Trading Failures.Through the &quot; Krasnaja Gazeta,&quot; Krassin has made a mournful confession of economic failure. The English treaty has produced no lasting result, and KerjentsefPs treaties have led to nothing. English firms have offered only short credit, whereas the Soviet would require a credit of at least five years for small purchases and up to 15 or 20 years for larger transactions. As for concessions, Krassin is disappointed that in spite of the protracted negotiations, not a single contract has been completed. He thinks, however, that before the present year is out concessions will have been completed in respect to forest and paper factories. Discussions are progressing with England and Belgium iu regard to concessions in the naphtha regions.In connection with these avowals the sharp criticism of the work of the Commissariat for Foreign Trade which was beard at a meeting of the
Soviet of Labour and Defence during July should be noted. The Com-rnissariat was accused of producing exaggerated reports of its purchases abroad, of improper keeping of accounts, of unbusinesslike methods of working, resulting in purchases being paid for twice, and of large organisation expenses. Krassin defended unprofitable transactions in England by pointing out that they had interested British firms in further transactions and had produced offers from German firms, which meant that prices were brought down to the normal. He also protested against the system of constantly changing the personnel of the delegations, and demanded that espionage on members should cease. It was ultimately decided that Soviet Delegations abroad might distribute their funds at their own discretion, provided tbey did not exceed such funds and carried out the general purchasing programme in accordance with the conditions prevailing on the foreign markets.The Soviet and Concessions.Reports as to concessions are conflicting. It is reliably stated that Krupps have acquired the Obukhovsky Works in conjunction with the Skoda (Austrian Krupps) as well as the Semeuikovski Works. They have further taken up iron-ore concessions on Mount Blagodat, in the Urals. Hugo Stinnes is said to have acquired the Treugolnik Rubber Factory, in which he was largely interested before the war.On the other hand the negotiations between Kopp and the German heavy industrials for the reconstruction of the Petrograd industry are said to show little chance of ending favourably. The Soviet is still intransigent, and advances one-sided proposals which give the German firms all the work and expense and the Soviet Government all the rights and advantages.A reliable report states that Krupps&apos; negotiations for securing a concession to work the Putilov factory have collapsed. Negotiations between Stinnes and Krassiu with regard to extensive forest concessions in Russia have not yet reached a definite conclusion. Kopp is trying, so far without success, to win over the Allgemeine Elektrizitiits Gesellschaft. The Hirsch Copper Concern has shown itself interested in the recon-structioii of the Rosenkranz Works at Petrograd and the cable works formerly belonging to Siemens, but has concluded that it cannot risk the necessary capital of from 200,000,000 to 30 3,000,000 marks. It has made a counter-proposal that it should undertake the purely organising work and the Russian Government supply the capital, but it is very doubtful whether this proposal will be accepted. German industrial circles are becoming less and less inclined to bear the sole financial risk of reconstructing Russian economic life, and appear to desire a partici-pation of British capital. They would prefer the floating of an inter-national loan, a plan which is said to be supported in the German Foreign Office by Wiedenfeld. Kopp is still determined to exclude British capital, at least as far as Petrograd industry is concerned. The Soviet is trying more and more to come to credit agreements, and various large German tool factories have tried to grant credits for goods against the mortgaging of Russian objects d&apos;art.A report from Reval states that negotiations between the British financial group owning the Vickers and Armstrong dockyards and the Soviet Government regarding the concession of Russia&apos;s largest naval dockyard at Nikolaieff, on the Black Sea, are nearly completed. The terms of the concession provide for the staff the same ex-territorial rights as for foreign diplomatic representatives in Russia. Twenty-five per cent, of the output will be the property of the Soviet Government.D 2
Mr. Urquharfs Visit to Russia.Mr. Leslie Urquhart has gone to Russia at the invitation of the Soviet Government to arrange the fiual formalities of an agreement between himself, on behalf of tho Rnsso-Asiatic Consolidated, and the Soviet, by which the company&apos;s properties are to be restored to them and they are to bo given facilities for working them. Mr. Urquhart has offered to place his own services and those of his organisation at tho disposal of the authorities in fighting famine and pestilence.Jt is believed that Mr. Urquhart is seriously seeking to bring influence to bear upon the British Government through industrial circles for opening a credit of 10 million pounds for Russia.Mr. Hoovor has telegraphed to Mr. Urquhart questioning whether the time is ripe either inside or outside Russia for his suggestions, as a further swing to the right is vital before confidence can be created abroad upon which such vitally constructive plans as Mr. Urquhart&apos;s can be erected. &quot; In the meantime we must do the best we can to promote sane progress both ways.&quot;Personal Notes.One Penoff has been appointed head of the Visa (?) department of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.It is reported, whether reliably is not known, that Zinovieff, disposing of unlimited funds, is now in charge of all Bolshevik propaganda.Bela Kun is said to be in charge of propaganda work in the countries of the former Austrian empire, while Radek superintends that in Poland, Germany, and Roumania.One Sarah Ravich is reported to be in charge of tho Foreign Office in Petrograd under control of the Moscow Foreign Office. Her assistants are Zalkind and Levitski.   All three are Jews.Bogdanov is said now to be president of the Supreme Council of People&apos;s Economy and Trades Unions and Smilga (ex-chief Military Commissar for the Polish front) one of the chief members. Neither is in the least qualified for his work.Schliapnikof, leader of the Workmen&apos;s Opposition Group, is now chief of the Soviet of Trades Unions.Quarrelling in London.The enmity between Litvinoff and certain members of the Trade Delegation in London is evidenced by tho sending of a telegram en clair by v/hich Litvinoff deprives Klishko of the right of signing passports and visas in view of the fact.that Klishko granted these contrary to instruc-tions from Moscow. In view of this lack of confidence Klishko has officially requested that he may be recalled to Moscow. Berzin has, however, refused to satisfy Klishko&apos;s request to resign, considering that Litvinoff has acted incorrectly. The visas in question were given by Klishko on the basis of Krassin&apos;s instructions, and it had been decided that in future visas and passports should be signed by Berzin. litvinoff has in consequence been asked to cancel his telegram. Berlin affirms that Klishko has not merited the affront he received in LitviuofFs telegram.Quarrels are also raging in the Areos Company now that the mollifying influence of Krassin is removed,   Klishko informs Tchitcherin
2,1that Solomon has taken the bit between his teeth and categorically refused to work with the Boardaccording to the Collegiate scheme.In his defence, Solomon states that the non-presentation of the accounts demanded from Arcos is solely the result of the chaos into which Gaastra has brought the Accountant and Finance Department. Solomon complains that his instructions and orders have not been carried out by Gaastra and the most open and impudent sabotage has resulted. He states that as the result of a severe reprimand Gaastra resigned. He was afterwards reinstated by a majority of two votes against Solomon&apos;s single vote. The board decided to transfer the control of the manage-ment of the Accountant and Finance Department to Krysin. Solomon declares that his attempts to regularise the work of Arcos are frustrated by a majority of two votes to one and that the dismissal of Gaastra is essential. Krysin states ou bis side that Solomon&apos;s statement is largely based ou misunderstanding aud that they propose that no decision should : be made until Krassin&apos;s arrival, when a detailed report will be presented.A Venture ot Arcos.The Arcos Society in London has organised an expedition consisting of five steamers and an ice-breaker, which left Murmansk in the middle of August for the Polar Seas and was joined at Archangel by another 12 steamers. The fleet carried chiefly agricultural machines and imple-ments, and hopes to convey wheat for Archangel and other goods on the return journey. S. L. Solomon seems to have had most to do with the organisation of this venture. The Berlin and Stockholm Trade Delega-tions co-operated.Miscellaneous.Moscow is re-registering the members of the Communist Party and cleans;ng the ranks by vigorous measures of expulsion. The members have been called upon to help by denunciations.The Bolshevik Press - credits the Soviet with a proposal to summon a &quot; Pacific Conference &quot; simultaneously with and in opposition to that at Washington. China, Mongolia, the Far Eastern Republics, and the various Soviet States are the suggested participants.Tho centres of Esperanto iu Russia are said to be in Simbirsk, Samara, and Kherson. The Soviet has voted 200,000 roubles (a few shillings) for assisting the work of the Esperanto branches abroad.. The Red Academy at Moscow, for the World Revolution, is directed by Tukotchevsky and is attended mainly-by Jews, aud also by certain emigrants from abroad.&quot;Isvestia&quot; remarks that though the Communist University for the Women of the East has been in existence only for a few months, hundreds of young people are streaming to it from the border provinces of the Soviet Republic, from the Near and Far East. Thirty-two nationalities are represented. In from six to eight months 600 to 700 young men and women will return to the East aglow with revolutionary kuowledge and ardour.The Special Department and the provincial Tcheka in Odessa and district are said to have been responsible for. the murder of about 28,000 persons since the beginning of the year. Moscow is said to have trans-ferred to Odessa its chief bureau for the fabrication of forged foreign
passports, chiefly Bulgarian and Italian. There is some talk also of transferring the central institutions of the Third International to Odessa.The British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International has intimated that after September 30th it will not be able to meet any deficit incurred in propaganda as formerly.According to Moscow the British Miners&apos; Federation has expressed its gratitude for tho Soviets gift of 2,000,000 roubles during the miners&apos; strike, and promised help for the starving population of Russia.The first cargo of Welsh coah to be shipped to Russia for several years has been despatched to Black Sea ports. Several orders from Petrograd are said to be pending.It is stated that up to July 15th the Bolsheviks had in hand 37,000,000 roubles in coin and 240 poods of platinum. All other resources have been exhausted. During 1920 only 7 poods (252 English lbs.) of platinum were produced in Russia, as against approximately 300 poods per year before the war. Some 300,000 poods of naphtha are being stored in the Grozny district, as there is no possibility of transporting it into the interior. Moscow admits that the position in the oil fields is very serious. Here the bore holes have been flooded, and li Baku is in an agony ; tho strong organism of Grozny is wavering.&quot; The Soviet news-papers state that actual catastrophe threatens in the Don, where rations are so short that 70 mines are being closed down. The workmen are deserting, and what has been accomplished by months of work is destroyed in a few days.The Soviet has been obliged to sell as quickly as possible 600,000 poods of cement and to purchase coal, small implements, clothing, and footwear.   It is proposed to make Constantinople the base of operations.With reference to the establishment of a Soviet bank in London, it is considered by the Delegation that to open a bank it is essential to have iii London at least  500,000 free. This sum should be transferred immediately and set aside. Directors have apparently not been obtained.The Bolsheviks consider that the refusal to permit Chialapin to enter England is a scandal. It is pointed out that the right of private earnings is not abolished. Chialapin has also been entrusted by the Commissariat for foreign trade with organising the export of articles of Russian art.FINLAND.The Government and the Red Question.The Finnish Government are reported to be at present fairly easy in their minds over the Red question. The stories told by Finns who have escaped from Russia make the best possible counter-propaganda, which is being encouraged by the Government. The Government have acceded to a demand from the Socialist Party and have announced that they will give passports to Finnish workmen who wish to seek employment in Russia. So far only six workmen have applied and only one has crossed the frontier.Before his departure Berziu presided over an emergency secret meeting in connection with the question of germ cells.The Difficulties of Traders.When the Finnish Trade Delegation arrived in Petrograd early in August it was informed that other foreigners had been first in the field
and that practically the whole of the stocks reserved for foreign trade had been exhausted this iu face of the list of articles which Russia was able to sell to Finland, published a few days previously by Krassin. The Delegation decided to move on to Moscow and see Krassiu.Kopp has demanded that negotiations for the purchase of paper in Finland should be stopped, as he has had an offer in Germany of paper of all kinds at prices considerably lower than those in Finland. The offer amounts to 50,000,000 Finnish marks. This demand violates the powers of Shvedchikoff, who arrived in Fitdand recently with the news that the local Bolshevik Trade Delegation was the centre for transactions in paper and was permitted both to regulate prices and to alter orders. Shvedchikoff has now hurriedly left for Moscow, as he was afraid to continue negotiations iu Finland without consulting the authorities. .Miscellaneous.The real name of Comrade Koronetz aud his wife is Jackson. They are American subjects.The only member of the Bolshevik Trade Delegation who is reported to be a Communist is the cashier, A. I. Kiriakoff.Sadoul has been staying at the Bolshevik Delegation^ headquarters. Rumour says that he came to Finland to meet Albert Thomas, who made a very brief stay at Helsingfors.Strong pro-German influences are reported to prevail in the Finnish Schutz Corps, in which nearly all the regular officers of the army are enrolled. A Committee of Jaegers is also a pro-German organisation and exercises a considerable influence on army policy.The latest development in the manufacture of false passports in Stockholm is said to be the forging of a visa stamp in Stockholm, where the visas are affixed in order to obviate the necessity of getting the Swedish visa from Helsingfors to Stockholm.The&apos; Soviet contre-espionago organisation in Finland is named &quot; Torse.&quot; It has 45 agents, of whom 17 are experienced Tcheka workers, and has for main object to combat White organisations. It is in touch with the Red Finns.Baltic States. ESTHONIA.The Activities of SeheePs Bank.The dubious activities of the bank of G. Scheel &amp; Co., Reval, have already been mentioned. It appears probable that Scbeol conducts, under cover of great secrecy, most of the financial transactions of the Russian Soviet Government in Central Europe and obtains for them the necessary valuta of other countries. There is evidence that the bank has received, through the Enskilda Bank at Stockholm, large sums of money in British notes sent by the British Banks on account of Scheels. Certain of these notes have later been discovered in the hands of well-known British revolutionaries.The bank at Reval is said not long ago to have written a draft on the Harju bank at Reval for over 130,000 reich marks. The Harju bank gave a draft on the Deutsche Bank, Berlin, where the money was paid
to tho Soviet Delegation. The Deutsche Bank has informed the Harju Bank that it does npt wish such transactions to occur in future, as the bulk of the money in question was used for propaganda purposes.Russian Matters.Litvinoff left Reval for Moscow on August 23rd. The appointment of Leonid Stark to replace him is confirmed. The work of the Delegation is going on as before : the rumour that owing to lack of funds employees have not been paid their salaries is untrue.The Esthonian and Lettish Ministers in Moscow are reported to have presented to the Soviet Government riotes protesting against the failure of Russia to observe the peace treaties.Trotsky&apos;s family passed through Reval towards the end of July en route for Germany.LATVIA.Soviet Proposals and Threats.While in Riga Krassin is said to have discussed with M. Meierovich a project for an economic alliance to be concluded with Soviet Russia by Latvia, Esthonia, Lithuania and Finland. It is understood that the Baltic Alliance will reply in the negative. As far as Latvia alone is concerned she will not even consider the proposal;With regard to the Military convention between Latvia and Poland, the Bolsheviks are reported to have unofficially warned the Letts that such an agreement would be regarded by the Soviet Government as a casus belli.Ganetsky has intimated that if the final reply of the Lettish Govern^ ment to the Soviet Note is unsatisfactory, Russia will sever diplomatic relations with Latvia.Riga reported on August 10th that a peace treaty has been signed in Moscow between Latvia and the Ukraine. The treaty settles questions concerning the return of refugees and option for citizenship.LITHUANIA.In order to check in some degree the growing discontent in the army, 10 per cent, of the men were released under certain conditions, for a month for work in the fields.Baron Fircks &amp; Co., of Riga are said to work with the Lithuanians in the secret purchase of arms from Germany. Although he hails from Latvia, Baron Fircks has been issued a Lithuanian passport by a special order of the Lithuanian Cabinet, as a reward for special services rendered to Lithuania.   He is a member of the Lithuania CE.POLAND.Labour Troubles.The Posnanian railwaymen have come out on strike for an extra month&apos;s wages as bonus to meet the increase cost of living.Warsaw has been deprived of gas, electricity and tramcars, and cut off from railway communication with Paris and Danzig by strikes of various bodies of workers.   The Government maintains that the strike is a result
of! Bolshevist, and German Communist agitation and is preparing to mobilise soldiers to operate the trains and public services.Bolshevik Intentions.Vosnesensky, a member.of the Soviet Repatriation Committee in Warsaw, has stated that the Bolsheviks will not conduct propaganda among the Polish population, but that they reserve to themselves the light to conduct propaganda among the Russian citizens in Poland. Propaganda among the Poles can only be successful if it comes from the West and not from the East.Personal.Karakhan, the Soviet emissary to Poland, has arrived in Warsaw with the members of his legation.According to Moscow, the Counsellor of the Polish Mission at Moscow is to be Knoll, and the First secretary Moravski.Jack Mills, the Labour M.P., with Professor Seager, has gone to Poland to make personel investigation into the assertions that Poland contemplates a new attack on Soviet Russia.It is reported that Dimitry Rubinstein, the ex-Petrograd and now Berlin banker, who exorcised a very evil influence during the war, has not been invited to Berlin for negotiations concerning the improvement of the currency value of the Polish mark, but is using this rumour to disguise his objects in Warsaw. He is arranging personal financial affairs and establishing relations with Polish banks in order to finance the Bolsheviks, who are using his Berlin firm and its branches in Vienna and Dantzig.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.GBEECE.The Anti-Communist Campaign.The repression of the Communists continues. Pamphlets have been confiscated ; the Communist headquarters have been raided and portraits of Lenin and other Commissars removed.As in Venizelist days the Royalist workmen used to vote for the Communists, so the Venizelists are now voting for Communist candidates. In this way they have captured the machinery of the Athens Labour Centre. The policy is of doubtful value, as it gives the Government a double handle.   Most members of the Labour executive a*&apos;e in prison.Miscellaneous.According to the &quot; Patris,&quot; a Greek envoy has arrived at RostofF to negotiate and conclude a commercial convention with the Soviet Government.Leon Pavlides has now become chief editor of the Communist organ &quot; Rizospastis,&quot; in place of Petsopoulos, who ia in goal. The paper, which is violently anti-English, displays increasing Bulgarophil and Turcophil tendencies.In consequence of the opposition of the landed proprietors, the Government have temporarily shelved the question of land expropriation. It has to be remembered, however, that all Thessaly voted Royalist on the assumption that expropriation would be continued. The Communists have sent agitators and propagandists to Thessaly and elsewhere.
YUGOSLAVIA.The Breaking of Communism.The Bill for the better security of the State, the drastic terms of which were mentioned in the Review for July, was passed by 190 votes against 54. The minority was composed of Communists, Clericals, aud Social Democrats, the latter voting against the Bill not because they approve of terrorism but because they disagreed with the annulment of the mandate of the Communist deputies. The loss of their mandates is not the only evil that has come upon the Communists. It now appears that Stejic, the author of the attempt on the Regent Alexander, did not act ou,his own initiative or at the instigation of Copic, Filipovic aud Kavacevic, the three arrested Communists deputies, but as a result of the activities of all the Communist deputies. The Communist Club had decided to answer the proclamation of December 29th by terrorism directed against the Regent and prominent politicians, and the decision to make the attempt on the Regent was taken by the Communist Club itself in the National Assembly Building and communicated to Stejic there. The Communist deputies have now been arrested. New members must be elected to replace the Communists, but the elections will not take place for about three months. Simon Marcowics, the leader of the Communists, is said to be on his way to England.The &quot; Baranya Republic.&quot;The &quot; Barauya Republic &quot; proclaimed at Pecs before the occupation of the Barauya area by the Hungarians was speedily at au end, aud the threats to blow up the mines if Horthy&apos;s troops entered the district never materialised. 30,000 persons of all classes are said to have left the Baranya at the approach of Horthy&apos;s troops. About 6,000 fugitives have, according to the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; been put into an internment camp by the Yugo-Slavs and have so far been well treated. It is expected that most of them will be distributed among Yugo-Slav mines and industries. There are 600 &quot;Intellectuals&quot; to whom Yngo-Slavia will not permit permanent residence, while Austria will not allow them to come to Vienna.BULGARIA.The Government and the Soviet.The country is said to be constantly visited by Soviet agents who are doing their -utmost to induce Bulgaria to renew political and trade relations with Russia. A convenient opportunity was found in the organisation of tho repatriation of Russian prisoners of war. Varna, the only Bulgarian port, maintaining communications with Russia, is the centre of propaganda.The Grovernment has, so far, been cautious. Before replying to the blandishments of the Bolshevik Trade Delegation it sent a mission of inquiry to Russia. The report submitted stated that Bulgaria had nothing to gain economically from trade relations, but that from a political point of view it was necessary for Bulgaria to renew relations with Russia. The Government could not, however, bring itself to renew official relations with the Soviet, and confined itself to the establishment of a regular boat service between Varna and Odessa.The Government is said to be preparing sweeping measures against the Socialists in the immediate future.
Threats from the Soviet.The Russian and Ukrainian Commissariats for Foreign Affairs liave addressed a note to Roumania, protesting against the alleged hostile operations which are being prepared against the Soviet in Roumania. Roumania is accused of supporting Petlura&apos;s organisations,&apos;and warned that should Petlurist bands escape into Roumanian territory, Soviet troops will continue their pursuit there.The Commissariat for Foreign Affairs was previously reported to have forwarded a project for a treaty between Russia and roumania. There are various provisions for the control of the Dniester, and one for a commission to proceed to Russia to arrange for the return of prisoners.The Communists and the Government.The Social-Communist Congress of Roumania had decided to adhere without restrictions to the Third International. Tho Socialists who voted in favour, of adherence, with certain restrictions, have been refused the right of vote in .the Party Directorate but have not been excluded from the Party.The Government has declared the Communist Party illegal and dissolved every trade union. In quarters inspired by Moscow this is considered a move to eliminate disturbing elements in the event of trouble with Russia.Miscellaneous. .On the discovery of a plot to derail the train in which the Crown Prince was-to travel to Transylvania, six Communists suspected of mining the track were arrested.,The new agrarian reform law, which has been passed by the National Assembly at Bucharest, provides for the parcelling out of at least 10 per cent, of the feudal ownings. The owners will receive total compensation from the State.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.Angora and the Bolsheviks.Rumours that Brusiloff is in Angora and that Bolshevik troops have arrived in Anatolia have been circulating in Constantinople. There is little doubt that these rumours owe their inspiration to the Angora Government, but the actual state.of affairs is very difficult to unravel. Brusiloff&apos; is certainly not in Angora, though he may have been appointed head of a military advisory mission, which was expected to reach Angora about the beginning of September. Ali Fuad Pasha in Moscow is reported to have informed Angora during the latter half of July that the Soviet was of opinion that the Kemalists could not decisively defeat the Greeks without assistance. If Angora refused the offer of the Soviet it was possible that the Bolsheviks would act independently and without invitation. The same source states that Angora recently learned that Enver Pasha was preparing to cross the Turkish frontier at the head of a Moslem army which he had recruited in the Caucasus. The Angora Government took immediate steps to prevent the fulfilment of his plans. The truth of the matter may be that Angora is seeking to frighten the
Ailies by the Bolshevik bogey, and to check tho despondency of the army and the population by persuading them that a Russian army will shortly help in driving tho Greeks into the sea. A relatively small force of Moslem troops may have crossed the Turkish frontier, and a Bolshevik military mission may have been appointed, to study how some assistance may best be given. Bolshevik policy appears to be directed to pre-venting a settlement of the Turkish question by every possible means.For their part the population of Anatolia are reported to maintain their attitude of hostility towards the Bolsheviks. Bagirov, the Soviet Consul at Trebizond, has been recalled to B,ussia at the request of the Angora Government. The name of his successor has not yet been ascertained. A Sovie&apos;t Consulate has been opened in Sarasun, the Consul being a Jew. named Golub. The Soviet Mission in Angora is said to have been cut down in numbers.The Bolshevik representative in Angora is said to have notified the Kemalists that the Azerbaijan Republic would be represented in Angora by its own ambassador, Comrade Ilieff (not identical with the notorious Eliava), who has been appointed by the Russian Soviet. Moscow intends to send a commercial mission to Angora in order to arrange, amongst other matters, for the exchange of Turkish cereals for petroleum.The Kemalists and Envei Pasha.The most valuable link binding the Bolsheviks with the Turkish Communist Party in Anatolia is said to be Euva Pasha. Enverists and Communists are, indeed, synonymous. But Enver is in Kemalist opinion an enemy of his country and his presence in Anatolia is not tolerated. His parly is, however, far from being destroyed. As many as four hundred Turkish Communists are said to be working secretly and general   -getically in Anatolia, most of them cloaking their activity under Govern-ment emplo&apos;ment. The majority of the members of the party are keen young Turkish intellectuals. They are present&apos; in the army itself, and Mustapha Kemal is said to be in fear of the organisation and of the popularity which Enver Pasha&apos;enjoys among certain circles in Anatolia, of his connection with Germany and of his activities in Turkestan and Afghanistan. For their part, the Bolsheviks are prepared to use the Turkish Commnnists for their purposes in Anatolia, as they did in the case of Uaghestan and Azerbaijan. It is conceivable that present event3 may create the situation required by the Bolsheviks and Enver Pasha.It is said to have been decided some time ago between Bolsheviks aud Enverists that in the event of a decisive defeat of the Kemalists by the Greeks, the Bolshevik army would enter Anatolia, but that if the Kemalists held fast the Bolsheviks would move against Persia. It is also suggested that the drive towards the Caucasus of hordes of starving Russian peasants may force the Bolsheviks into Anatolia.It was reported late in August that the antagonism between the supporters of Mustapha Kemal and the adherents of Enver Pasha was growing and had become particularly acute among the headquarters staff of the Eastern front. The Kemalists seem to have more than held their own.The Communists in Constantinople.The Border Commissariats of the Bolsheviks are being warned of the position of affairs in Constantinople and are being strictly forbidden to go there unless they have previously obtained a visa from the British
Military Authorities in Constantinople, otherwise they will most certainly he arrestotl and deported. It is stated that Kuzuetsoff was arrested on the evening of August 1st.Secret Turkish Communist centres, working underground, are said to have existed for some time in Constantinople. One such centre, known as the Turau Artisans&apos; Club, exists in Stamboul, and is an offshoot of the notorious Unionist institution known as the Turkish Club. Its activities have hitherto limited themselves to Communist propaganda amongst Turkish workpeople, university students and professors. Funds are obtained by begging. Nuri Bey, Inspector of Public Instruction, is president of the Club.The District Communist Committee of Constantinople has sufficiently recovered from the fright occasioned to it by the raid on the Soviet Trade Delegation to call a general meeting at which one Leikin, was appointed temporarily president. Leikin pledged himself to active support of Communism and terrorism, but au extreme discretion prevailed generally. No active work is to be undertaken ; the distribution of propaganda is to be stopped, and the Committee is to cut away altogether from the remaining members of the Trade Delegation. In was also decided to hold aloof from the Beikos organisation and the Kemalists until the position is clearer. A small centre has been established at Scutari. The appointment as temporary president of Leikin, a member of the Russian Communists Party since 1919, gives the organisation a semi-official footing as regards recognition by Moscow.The Boikos Committee is even more nervous than the District-Communist Committee. It, too, has stopped all active work, and has taken extraordinary precautions as regards secrecy. The members have scattered. As the result of a letter commenting upon the work of the Committee and demanding exhaustive information concerning the military and political situation in Constantinople, the Committee are arranging a general meeting at which a new executive committee will be chosen and the future of the organisation discussed.A reliable source states that a new Bolshevik financial organisation is about to be formed in Constantinople&apos;, called &quot; The Financial Industrial Bank &apos;-&apos; (Finansovo-Promishlonny Bank). This concern will subsidise the Turkish Nationalists&apos; undertakings in Constantinople, provided these allow the spread of Communist ideas in the Near East. It will also be responsible for financing the various Bolshevik-Kemalist secret organisa-tions in Constantinople, whose work has been approved by the-authorities themselves. The organisers count on establishing branches in Georgia, Persia, and South Rttssia, as well as at Trebizoud and Samsun.The activities of the Trans-Caucasian Trade Delegation, of which a certain Georgian named Modabadze is tho head, have aroused some suspioiou. Strong reasons exist for the belief that the organisation is likely to replace the former so-called Trade Delegation as the new centre for Communist activity in Constantinople.Kuznetsoff on Current Affairs.Certain Russian refugees have asked Kuznetsoff whether they might return in a group to their native country for the purpose of tilling the soil for the next harvest. If this is permitted they intend to bring with them some agricultural implements and seeds, but they wish to know whether they would suffer penalties as some of them in the past belonged
to the Anti-Soviet Army. there are also suggestions of organising a systematicexport of foodstuffs to relatives who havo been left behind in Russia. .A Committee for organising help for Russia, which appears to consist largely of anti-Soviet elements has been formed in Coustanti-nople, but according to Kuznetsoif, most of the local refugees are dissatisfied with this Committee.With regard to questions of trade Kuznetsoff complains that local foreign trade committees arrive in Constantinople with all kinds of money and raw produce and try to transact business independently of the Soviet Trade Delegation.The Zionists.The Constantinople Zionist Committee has for head of its Palestine Emigration Bureau a certain Dr. Temkin, who appears to be iu touch with the Bolshevik Trade Delegation. The Committee exists officially in order to provide relief for- Jewish emigrants from Russia and arrange for their disposal in Palestine and elsewhere. Its unofficial activities are wider ; an intelligence centre has been established which appears to watch the proceedings of real or supposed anti-Semitic groups, and the members of the Committee are markedly interested in politics.Miscellaneous.A sum of half a million Turkish pounds, believed to be a subsidy from the Soviet Government, is said to have reached Angora during the first fortnight of July, and to have been used in paying in gold the salaries of civilians and militaiw officials.The Persian Diplomatic Mission arrived in Angora during July, ft is headed by Amir Hashmet Khan, a Baili chief, who is in reality a leader of the Persiiin Turcophiie revolutionaries, and who means to resume, in co-operation with the Bolsheviks, certain &apos; revolutionary activities iu Persia.Recent information goes to show that the Pan-Islamic Association known as the &quot; Muvabidin Jemieti &quot; has changed its title to &quot; muhammadan-madie Jemieti,&quot; aiid has grown iu importance with the growing influence of the Nationalists and with the religious revival iu Anatolia. Letters taken from an Indian deserter in Turkish territory and designed to promote sedition among Indian troops, go to prove that there exists an Indian section of the society.EGWT.The Progress of Bolshevism.The decision of the Third International to turn its attention towards the East may indicate an imminent Bolshevik campaign in Egypt, which the International appears to consider a promising field for the opening of its movement against Great Britain. It is considered that a. successful rising in Egypt will be the signal for setting the whole Mohammedan world ablaze. Bolshevik efforts are to bs devoted mainly to the Nile Delta and the Suez Canal area. Moscow cannot give much material assistance, but the Communist nuclei can support the rising and Western representatives can assist through communications established via, Marseilles, Messina and Crete.The Egyptian Bolshevik organisations are meanwhile reported to be working for the enlistment of the Nationalists under the Red Flag.   The
extremist Nationalists are displaying a revolutionary tendency, and are ripening for the reception of Bolshevik propaganda. I his propaganda has for present aim, not the establishment of Communism, but revolution a-ainst Great Britain and British rule. The Egyptian army does not appear to have so far been infected with Bolshevism.The Activities of Joseph Rosenthal.Joseph Rosenthal, mentioned in the Review for July, has been known to the Alexandria police for 20 years as a holder of extreme opinions. There is little doubt that he has very strong Communist ideas, which he actively disseminates. But he is a cautious person. While he does not apparently favour violent methods, he has for present aim to unite all workers in Egypt into one big confederation. He seems to be an agent or correspondent open as far as is known of the Third Inter-national ; he is in touch with LitvinofF and with Third International agencies in Vienna and New York. There is little doubt that Rosenthal is also in touch with Bolshevik elements in Palestine. His Workers&apos; Syndicate includes a good many Jews with Communist ideas. Tho Club in Alexandria known as &quot; Groupe d&apos;Etudes Sociales &quot; is said to require watching in view of its connection with Rosenthal and his activities. It need not, however,&quot;be taken very seriously for the moment. It is believed to be responsible for the distribution of an inflammatory Communist manifesto.Miscellaneous.Outward political excitement is completely stilled, but the followers of Zaghlul are doubtless working along their chosen lines of attacking the Government for its &quot; coercion &quot; and &quot; tyranny &quot; ; of discrediiing the official delegation at home and abroad and of organising for the sweeping of the country when the elections for the National Assembly takes place. Zaghlul has gone to his property in the country where he will remain for some weeks. The Greek advance in Anatolia has chastened the Kenialists. -   *A large number of influential Egyptians, including many dissentient members of ZaghluPs delegation, have formed an.&quot;Independent Egypt&quot; Party for the active support of the Adly Cabinet.PERSIA.Rothstein&apos;s Activities.Theodore Rothstein&apos;s attitude is mild and apparently reasonable, on the testimony of the Shah himself. But the Shah, like all Persians, official or other, is sceptical of the value of Russian assurances. He showed the British Minister the volume presented to him by Rothstein, which he referred to as &quot;1&apos;album des assassins.&quot; This book contains very large photographs of all the leading personalities of Soviet Russia, in whose features the Shah professed to detect strong signs of criminal tendencies.At the beginning of August it is believed that a fairly large sum of money was transferred through London by Litvinoff to Rothstein or to the representative of the Commissariat for Foreign Trade.
According to Moscow, a revolutionary movement lias broken out on the frontier of Persia and Turkestan, on the Caspian coast. The leader has ordered the division of the land among the peasantry,Mohammed Taki, who was appointed Military Governor of Khorasan by the Sayyed Zia ed Din&apos;s Government, has refused to accept dismissal from the present Government, and has proclaimed the independence of Khorasan.The Government is rcjxnled to havo gained an important success in Mazandaram over the Persian Bolsheviks, who appear no longer to enjoy Russian support.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES.CENTRAL ASIA.AFGHANISTAN. An Outpost of Revolution.There can be no question of the aims of the Bolshevik penetration of Afghanistan. It is directed towards spreading revolutionary teaching in India. Within 18 months Suritz has secured concessions which have been withheld from British missions during the last 70 years. The Soviet envoy has secured treaty rights for the making of roads, the laying of a telegraph line along the Herat-Kabul route, and the installa-tion of printing presses in Kabul. Railway connections with Afghanistan are being completed on the Persian Afghan frontier, a junction is being made with the Herat and Kabul roads, and the Oxus line has been pushed down to within 70 miles of the Northern Afghan outposts. This line is connected with tho great highway of the East towards India.For their part, according to statements by Rabindranath Tagore, the . Indian revolutionaries have the idea of converging towards Afghanistan where they feel that they have a friend in the Amir. This idea appears to be gaining ground. The&quot; Indians look for help to Enver Pasha, who is said to be organising the frontier troops on the Pamir side, as well as an army in Bolshevik Turkestan.Seventy German officers are reported to have gone via Russia to Afghanistan, where General Leman is workiug. His Headquarters are near the frontier, and these officers are proceeding to Horat.AZERBAIJAN.Both Azerbaijan and Armenia are, like Georgia, now faced with famine. Systematic requisitions have stripped the land and driven the peasants to sow no mere than the bare area of land required for their own needs. Deaths from cholera in Baku alone amount to 400 a day, and children are perishing in thousands from dysentery and other epidemics.GEORGIA.The Russification of the Country.The fears of the Georgians that Moscow means to Russify their country are being strengthened by present events. Russian policy and practice were mentioned in the Review for July. The Russians seek to justify their continued presence in Georgia on the ground that the organisation of the Georgian Red forces has not beentcompleted. 20,000 men are said to have been enlisted, and a force of 36,000 men is aimed
at. Shalva Eliava&apos;s plans for organising the Georgian army on a national basis have been modified as a result of representations by Gekker, Commander of the 11th Red Army, and the Georgian army has been set under the direct orders of the Army Commander of Rostov, instead of under Gekker in Tiflis. These are potent sources of diseon-tent. Meanwhile the internal administration is being organised ou lines which broadly resemble Communist policy in Russia.The strong national feeling in the country, expressed by the virile Georgian. Menshevik Party, is the greatest enemy to Communism in Georgia. The opposition works through the formation of illegal Socialist organisations, the boycotting of Communist efforts at propaganda, the formation of partisan detachments, open demonstrations, aud the efforts of the anti-Bolshevik organisations to take joint, action with the Armenian insurgents. The peasantry and working classes are showing a growing hostility to the Communists. Many of them have joined the Mensheviks, and they have proved their mettle in various ways notably by the powerful protest which defeated the attempts of the Communists to arrest popular Georgian leaders. Various counter-measures have been attempted by the Bolsheviks.The Communist Party itself appears to have split into Russophile and Russophobe elements. The pro-Russian element has been strengthened by the recent nomination of Budu Moivani, the late Soviet representative in Angora as People&apos;s Commissar for Foreign Trade in the Tiflis Government, The Communists are becoming more hostile to the Social Democrats, It was, in fact, stated at a party meeting that should the Communists be compelled at any time to leave Georgia they would first of all clear the country of all Social Democrat Mensheviks.Famine and Ruin.The economic ruin which has befallen Russia is rapidly overtaking Georgia. The price of food rises continually, and grave fears are enter-tained that the harvest will fail. The same causes are operating here as in Russia. Anatolia is looked upon i as a possible granary. The towns are taking on the air of destitution characteristic of Russia, and depression and hopelessness are increasing. The salary of employees has been fixed at 15,000 to 20,000 roubles per month the price of one pound of meat.Typhus, and cholera, introduced from Russia, are raging. The Bolsheviks privately admit that the position is desperate, but they continue to provision the Red Army at the expense of the Georgian people. Flour imported from Constantinople is sent away to Baku and Georgia ; only absolute necessities are left in Georgia to meet the immediate requirements of the Communists. Bread is dearer in Georgia than iu the famine regions of Russia.An Abkhasian Soviet.The Abkhasian Province is said to have been declared an &quot; Abkhasian Soviet Socialist Republic,&quot; which has asked Lenin, through the Com-munist leader, Eshba, to be allowed to join Soviet Russia without being subordinated to Russia. Lenin replied that Eshba could play at being an Abkhasian president, but that Abkhasia was bound with Georgia economically and historically, and the sooner she joined Georgia the better for her. The Abkhasian Revolutionary Committee has nationalised all raw material in the country ; nevertheless, all supplies of wood are controlled by the Tiflis Wood Department and the Georgian Sovnarkhoz. o 15935 b
The Bolsheviks are said to meditate transferring the Caucasus Army headquarters from Rostov to Tiflis.The Georgian Soviet Government has sent to Constantinople two com-mercial delegates, one Zhuruli, a National Democrat, and one Modebadze, a Bolshevik acting as Georgian Reople&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Trade. Zhuruli, who was Minister of Finance under tho former Menshevik Government, has been authorised to deal with the question of exporting manganese from Georgia ; Modebadzeis trying to arrange for the purchase and exchange of various commodities.TURKESTAN.Nizam Bai, who has constantly been waging guerilla warfare against the Bolshevik invaders in Ferghana, is said to have won a considerable success by capturing Irkishtam, on the borders of Chinese Turkestan, and almost annihilating the Bolshevik garrison. Slier Mohomed, another guerilla warrior, is in control further south, near the Kara Lake. He has embraced the cause of the ex-Khan of Bokhara against the Bolsheviks.It is reported that the Bolsheviks have removed to Tashkend and Orenburg the country&apos;s coal and oil, which are being used chiefly for running propaganda trains. The people are gathering the dried roots of sumach bushes, which will be their only fuel in the coming winter. All payment is in kind.   There are no holidays and no recreation.8. FAR EASTERN STATES. SIBERIA.Anti-Soviet Movements.Ungern-Steinberg is said to be still resisting the Reds in the area south-east of Lake Baikal, and the stories spread by Moscow of his com-plete defeat are untrue. Kappel&apos;s troops have cleared the littoral of the Coast province of Bolsheviks, and at Vladivostock MerkulofTs Govern-ment is consolidating its opposition. It refuses for the present to embark on an aggression policy against the Bolsheviks. Sporadic revolts continue further west, in the territory held by the Bolsheviks. The Moscow wireless was alleging early in August that the position of MerkulofFs supporters was desperate, and that the financial crisis was becoming catastrophic,. A Chita report, sent via Moscow, declared that Merkuloffs Government was terrorising&apos;the strikers, with the object of provoking them and securing Japanese intervention.According to Moscow the Cossack Conference at Vladivostock deprived SemenofT of the title of Ataman. As a consequence the Cossack groups have become divided.JAPAN.A Russian newspaper is responsible for the statement that a Communist movement among Korean revolutionaries has spread considerably among the Korean proletariat during 1921. Owing to circumstances in Korea the Congress of Korean Communists was held on Russian territory.It was reported to the Congress of the Third International that the Japanese Socialist League has a membership of a little over 3,000. An underground party, with which the Communists of America are said to be in direct touch, is being formed.Considerable and increasing unrest is reported to prevail among the workers, due in great measures to the contrast between vast war fortunes
and excessively low wages. A deputation representing 25,000 workers in the munition factories is said to have been recently denied the release of its leaders, whereupon the crowd stormed the War Ministry in. Tokio. Tho appearance of troops compelled the withdrawal of the mob. So strong is the agitation that the Government may be forced to allow the trade unions to function.CHINA.Extremist Movements.Information from China states that during the past year undoubted progress has been made by the Russian Bolsheviks and the Chinese Anarchist Societies, whose tenets, but not control, are Bolshevik. Nevertheless, the prospects of the Russian Soviet obtaining serious hold over China and the surrounding countries have diminished. Moscow, though it sends missions from time to time, and is very far away, is even now sending another; and no Bolshevik State, in Siberia is strong enough to be of much support to a Bolshevik party in China. Tho outstanding features of the past year have been the establishment of a Far Eastern Mission at Pekiu, covering a direct Bolshevik intrigue in China, and the success of General Chen Chiung-ming and Dr. Sun Yat Sen at Canton.Sun Yat Sen.has lately been devoting much time to Socialism, and has refused foreign concessions. It is understood that a delegate has been sent to the Russian Soviet Government, and it is thought that Bolshevik propaganda will be extensively spread in Southern China. The Chinese Press has published the outline of an agreement said to have been concluded between Canton and Soviet Russia. The alleged terms provide for mutual recognition, commercial intercourse, financial help from Russia to the Associated Provincial Government, and help from the latter in spreading Bolshevik ideas in China. This report must, however, be taken with reserve.Shanghai has been the chief centre of extremist activity. Here the establishment of a Bolshevik paper called &quot; Shanghai Life&quot; and the control of the Russian Ob-operative Society enabled finance and propa-ganda to work hand in hand. The offices of the &quot; Shanghai Life &quot; are a centre for disaffection in Shanghai, and for the various agents who visit the place. Funds are low, however ; the agents have received no money for the last two or three months, and representatives have been sent to China to try to obtain funds.As for the Anarchists, their progress owes much to the open action of Chen Chiung-ming and the secret support of Sun Yat Sen. The leading Anarchists have congregated in Canton, and have founded Societies in China as well as in Malaya, the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. They circulate much literature and appear to have made special efforts to tamper with the troops in North China a danger which the Peking Government is seriously fighting. But the chief danger lies in the anti-British and anti-foreign feelings and propaganda of the Chinese Anarchists, and in their influence over labour at the ports. The Kung Tang, or Labour Union, has a very real control over Chinese Labour, particularly at the ports, and the Anarchist leaders have a powerful hold on its organisation. Bolshevism in the North, possible general strikes&quot; in the South, and Bolshevik propoganda designed to exploit anti-Japanese feeling, are the chief dangers. The Central Government is said to have little authority outside Peking, and the real power is in the hands of the reactionary military governors.e 2
Miscellaneous.Turkish emissaries, affecting a profound interest in the future of the Far East, are said to be busy in China.   Their activities are anti-British.The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; alleges that the Military Governor of Chinese Turkestan has thanked Lenin for the courageous support given to the Chinese authorities by the Russian Red troops in liberating the province from White Guard bands.Yourin has been replaced by Alexis Agariev, a former Mayor of Vladivostock and a worker on the &quot; Shanghai Life,&quot; and a strong propaganda organisation is reported to have been established at Chita under the leadership of Vorvowsky, who has had a successful career in Europe.Sudhindra Bose, the well-known Indian agitator, is reported to have been in Shanghai for a few days during June. He affirmed that he was one of 50 Indians scattered all over the world serving &quot; The Mother.&quot; The chief centre of the work in the East would be Tokio. Bose visited Sun Yat Sen, who is said to have a genuine desire to help India against &quot; the common enemy of mankind,&quot; Great Britain. According to Bose, all the leaders in Canton are very anti-British, and are trying to prevent British trade finding a market in Kwangtung.9. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.The Unemployment Problem.Unemployment continues steadily, and at Vancouver the temper of the workless is growing more bitter. The unemployed in South Vancouver have demanded the control of all relief work, and have gone so far as to threaten to use force in making men leave a job which is not run according to their wishes. In the city of Victoria relief work is rapidly nearing an end. Heavy dismissals a reduction from 8,000 to 4,000 men  are taking place from the Hydro-Electric canal works in Ontario. The men here are a rough class and have already talked of violence.Many of the unemployed at Regina are reported as refusing to take works on the farms at wages now quoted, and are holding out for better pay when  the harvest starts. The dissatisfaction among the workers appears to be greater than at any time during the last two years.The radical and especially the foreign element in Montreal is said to be under the impression that the unemployment problem will force a revolution in Canada during the coming winter.Communist Movements.It seems to be pretty definitely established that 2,500 dollars have been sent by the Pan-American Bureau to organise the Communist Party of Canada. This money came from Moscow. The Bureau is keeping its Canadian adherents short of cash, perhaps, because the Canadian party has not yet obtained the formal recognition of Moscow. That may not, however, be much longer delayed, as the head of the Pan-American Bureau recently inspected the Toronto headquarters and expressed him-self satisfied with the progress made. Jealousy prevails in the party. Bell is busily trying to oust Macdonald as chief organiser.The Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Canada state that they have appointed district organisers covering the whole country, and that the structure of the new organisation is almost complete. Language bureaux have been appointed for the Russian, Jewish, Lithuanian, Finnish, and Bulgarian groups, and a convention of the Ukrainians has been called to form its own language section.   Quo
sinister activity is reported the Party is said to be trying to place adherents in munition works and factories for making explosives. The purpose, apart from sabotage, is to train as many Communists as possible to manufacture explosives, with an eye to contingencies.Various activities are reported from the local branches. The English-speaking Communists in Ontario are proceeding with the work of organisation. In Hamilton the party has resolved to purge itself of five active agitators, two of them men who were tried and acquitted on charges of sedition last April.The Communist organisation of Western Ontario now has three sub-districts Toronto, the Hamiltou-Kitchener-Guelph area, and the Niagara district.Toronto is said to have been visited recently by a representative from Moscow. The Communist Party there is being looked over with a view to being recognised and subsidised, and is working furiously.With reference to individuals it has been discovered (hat the Com-mnnist Convention held in May appointed Jack Kavanagh, chief organiser for the whole of canada west of Port Arthur. During his recent journey Kavanagh organised several centres and laid the foundation for the establishment of at least one group.A rumour prevailed in Edmonton some time ago that a certain &quot; George Carscadden &quot; had gone to Moscow as a delegate to the Red International of Trade Unions. Inquiries in Windsor show that the revolutionary journalist, Gordon Cascadden, has been absent some time, aud that it is regarded as probable that he has gone to Moscow.F. W. Kaplan, of Winnipeg, appears to be an important link in the Communist organisation. He is trying to found a Communist group at Regina.The Ukrainian Organisations.The connection between the Ukrainian Labour Temple Association and the Communist movement appears to be now established. Speaking at Ottawa, a travelling organiser named Hoculiuk revealed that the party was united with the Third International and now called itself the Cauadiam Communist Party. He had been told by the Communist head-quarters at Winnipeg that the Canadian Communist section would hold a secret congress at Toronto as soon as the delegates arrived from Russia. Hoculiuk is to go west during the harvest, on a propaganda and organi-sation campaign.Not all the Ukrainian movements are revolutionary. The society called &quot; Bogan &quot; in Calgary opposes the Ukrainian Temple Association, and is described as&apos; being supported by the Catholic and Orthodox churches, a statement which seems to contradict itself. It is strongly nationalist and opposes both Bolshevism and Canadianisation.Ukrainian teachers and students have held a convention at Winnipeg. A new organisation was formed, which is to promote higher education among the Ukrainians, to acquaint them with Canadian history and Canadian poetry, to check Bolshevism among the people, and to promote the interests of the Ukrainian from the educational point of view.A proposal has been made to float a million dollar issue of bonds for the &quot; Western Ukrainian Galician Republic.&quot; The revolutionary group of Ukrainians seems to be strongly opposed to this project.The Canadian National Union of Ex-Service Men.The activities of that dangerous body, the Canadian National Union of ex-Service Men, have somewhat subsided, but the membership main-tains itself.   The Union say, without mincing words, that they are out
for straight revolution and that they will not bo hound by the theories of the Socialist Party or of its leaders when the time comes for action. Headquarters in Vancouver frequently avow themselves to be in touch with the National Union of ex-Service Men in England, and hint occasionally that they are connected with an international organisation, presumably the Union of Former Combatants.In Vancouvor itself the Union is said to be declining, in some measure owing to the transfer of Jack Kavanagh&apos;8 interest to his newest toy, the Communist Party. It may also be surmised that the Union has completed its organisation and enrolled all possible recruits, and so has time to spend in squabbling. It should be noted that for reasons at present unknown, the Communists are fiuding it difficult to organise in Vancouver.Tho prospects of the Union elsewhere are not very bright. In Toronto, where local opinion is much divided, it is difficult to found a branch. At Prince George, where the Union is seeking to establish a unit, its efforts are received on the whole.with indifference. Henry Sullivan, who calls himself the &quot; military leader&quot; of the Union, is at his wits&apos; end for money. His schemes for procuring funds are said to extend even to highway robbery. As far as Calgary is concerned the Union is an absolute failure, the returned men refusing to have anything to do with it. After great trouble in getting a permanent secretary the Union has now completed its organisation in Winnipeg.Extremist Labour Movements.The position of the One Big Union appears to be declining. The Fort Rouge unit, the strongest financially in the Union, has seceded, and the gravity of the situation for the Union is thereby considerably increased. R. B. Russell lias withdrawn his request for employment in the railway shops and will continue to organise for the One Big Union. R. J. Johns, on the other hand, has declared that he is &quot; through &quot; with Russell, and wants to get back to work. In Winnipeg the One Big Union is still torn with strife. On the other hand, One Big Union sentiment is said to be growing in the Alberta mine fields.The disintegration and financial embarrassment of the Loggers&apos; Union continue. A fresh blow has been the action of the One Big Union in admitting persons to membership without paying dues. Two lumber camps at Ocean Falls have deserted the Loggers&apos; Union for the One Big Union.The north-western states of America are said to be full of Industrial Workers of the World and bad characters moving north. Though pains are being taken to close the border, au irruption of these undesirables into Canada is to be feared.The Labour Congress.Five hundred delegates attended the Trades and Labour Congress at Winnipeg. The delegates who have decided to form a national political party are to confer with the leaders of the Farmers&apos; Party with the object of effecting a working alliance. Planks in the party platform are the removal of taxation on necessaries of life, abolition of fiscal legislation leading to class privilege, nationalisation of the banking system, and a capital levy for the reduction of the war debt. Mr. J. W. Bruce, of Toronto, has been elected President of the Labour Party, and Mr. Dixon, who leads the Labour group in the Manitoba Legislature, vice-president.
Miscellaneous.The Vancouver Sikhs are issuing a weekly publication called &quot;Bande Mataram,&quot; which seems to be largely intended for circulation in India.It has been discovered that the membership of the Samo Obrazowania Society includes a number of Bolshevist-minded Jews.A feature of the election campaign in Calgary was the scant interest taken iu the Socialist candidature. The two Labour candidates were, however, elected.The paper strike which has lasted since May 1st has come to an end, an average wage reduction of 20 per cent, having been accepted by the employees of the Anglo-Newfoundland Developments company&apos;s Paper Mills.The British Empire League, which works hard against disloyalty, has made much headway in British Columbia, particularly in Vancouver. The radical element is trying to plant spies in it.The International Bible Students&apos; Association appears to propagate a very subtle species of Bolshevism. It also promotes an expectancy of tumult and revolution which is favourable to the efforts of other agitators.SOUTH AFRICA.A Council of Action.A letter from the International Socialist League at Johannesburg to the Secretary of the British Bureau at Manchester mentions that at present &quot; The International&quot; is the only paper iu South Africa which is devoted to Socialism and the Workers&apos; interests. It is stated that the League is watching very carefully the lied Trade Union movement in Great Britain and has attempted to follow the British example, but so far there has been no successful co-ordination of the efforts of the Left Wing Trade Unionists in South Africa. The latest development has been the formation of a Council of Action within the South African Mine Workers&apos; Union. It is being organised by the fighting section, who allege victimisation by the Union at the request of the Chamber of Mines for calling an unauthorised strike. The leaders were fined from 151. to 20/. each and suspended from office in the Union for periods varying from one to four years, The International Socialist League was to meet with other Left Wing organisations in Cape Town on July 30th for the purpose of forming a United Communist Party (South African section of the Third International).Miscellaneous.Employees in the building trade have been instructed by their Union to accept a lock-out rather than a reduction of wages. Some 9,000 men are affected.The Band strike has terminated by an acceptance of the owners&apos; terms, and work will be resumed as soon as possible. Kecent amalgama-tions have resulted in placing every mine in South Africa and Rhodesia under the authority of the South African Mine Workers&apos; Union, as far as trade union affairs are concerned.The municipal elections at Durban, fought exclusively on the tramway strike issue, have endorsed the city council&apos;s rejection of the strikers&apos; demands and its refusal to submit the dispute to arbitration. Durban has been tramless since June 12th.
AUSTRALIA.The Queensland Premier, Mr. Theodore, has denounced the Industrial Workers of the World as simply a baud of destroyers, who have only a policy of direct action opposed to the spirit and hopes of the Labour movement. Labour, if it is to survive, must rid the community of the Industrial Workers of the World.Mr. Barwell, the Prime Minister of South Australia, has stated that there is increasing evidence that arbitration is bringing disaster to the Federal and State Governments and people, and causing unemployment by imposing impossibly high wages. Tho system needed revision at the earliest possible opportunity.The Labour caucus in New South Wales met at the end of August to elect 10 nominees to the Legislative Council, who will be appointed afterwards according to constitutional practice. The caucus already elects the Ministers, but this is the first time that it has elected councillors. The candidates are required to sign the Labour pledge, including the abolition of the Legislative Council. Councillors are unpaid but travel free, and the appointment is for life.NEW ZEALAND.The One Big Union condemned.Serious opposition to the proposal to form One Big Union of all Trade Unions throughout Australasia is apparent in Labour circles. The officials of the Seameifs and Watersiders&apos; Union and the &quot; The Maoriland Worker,&quot; the organ of the extreme Labour Party, are dissuading the workers from the scheme. The newspaper is advocating the cohesion of the workers of New Zealand and the finding of some common ground which shall deprive the capitalists of control of the Government. But it has departed from its policy of advocating any and every means to a change, and now pleads for constitutional methods.Miscellaneous.Unemployment has not yet become acute. Financial stringency continues, with marked effects in the larger centres.It is reported that Communist literature from Russia is reaching the Dominion through the medium of Karl Malmsten, of Stockholm, who is apparently a distributing agent for Bolsheviks.Branches of the Irish Self-Determination League have been established at Wellington with a membership of about 300, and at Christchurch with a membership of about 200. There are indications that the movement is spreading throughout the country.WEST   INDIES. The Negro Question in Jamaica.The well educated negroes in Jamaica are reported to have little or no actual racial prejudice. During the last few years, however, the cry of &quot; Jamaica for the Jamaicans &quot; has been growing among the ignorant peasant class, but it is not likely to cause any immediate trouble. Trade Unionism, which has been introduced into Jamaica, may present a graver problem, if it is recklessly used, but the chances are that it will break down. The Universal Negro Improvement Association has been active, but its propaganda has not greatly impressed the Jamaican negro.   The
nature of the people and the general conditions are adverse to any general native rising.The Jamaican Government has been obliged to repatriate hundreds of Jamaicans who had been working on the sugar estates in Cuba, where the situation is serious owing to financial stringency and the closing down of estates. The repatriated Jamaicans report that there is a large number still in Cuba without food or money.Marcus Garvey&apos;s Campaign.Marcus Garvey was in Belize at the beginning of July, and left on tho 5th of that month for Guatemala on a tour of the Spanish Republics. Garvey addressed several meetings, which were not well attended. His speeches were moderate in tone, and he stated that his movement was not intended to overthrow any established Government. The aims of the Universal Negro Improvement Association were, he said, firstly the establishment of a Black Star Mercantile Marine, and secondly the forma-tion of a negro empire in Africa. Garvey made fervent appeals for funds for these objects.PERU.Reports have reached Lima of a revolt of Government workers and troops in Iquitos, the capital of the province of Loreto. Soldiers looted the Peru and London Bank, carrying away  23,000. Troops have been sent to Iquitos, a three weeks&apos; journey distant.10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Communist Developments.An important recent development is the decision of the Communist Party to establish &quot; Labour Alliances &quot; on both sides of the boundary. There is to be an American Labour Alliance and a Canadian Labour Alliance the latter as yet but a project. The idea is to federate all the Labour and other bodies which are controlled by Communists. The American Labour Alliance apparently hopes to set up as an opposition to the American Federation of Labour, and has won the support of a number of extremists and revolutionary associations. The secretary is &quot;Caleb Harrison,&quot; the Communist organiser, who until lately was living in Toronto under the name of &quot;Caleb Atwood,&quot; and who orgauised the present Communist Party of Canada.The American Zionists.The quarrel of Dr. Weizmann, the International Jewish leader, with the leaders of the American Zionist organisation has resulted in the resignation of 36 out of the 50 members of the Zionist organisation of America. This split is likely to affect the raising of funds in the United States for the development of Zionist activities in Palestine. The American Zionist Organisation, a rich and powerful body, has hitherto been directed by a committee of prominent American Jews. Its aims have been practical; it has been opposed to political interference in Palestine, and has considered it unwise for the Jews to attempt to form any kind of political organisation in that country. Dr. Weizmann and his supporters, however, thought themselves justified in spending money raised by the American Jews for Palestine on the foundation of a Jewish college in Vienna ; they also hold that they may spend these moneys on general Jewish propaganda in Europe and on improving the status of Jews in such countries as Poland and Roumania.   Weizmann&apos;s party also
wish to encourage immigration into Palestine on a democratic and some-what sentimental basis. Weizmanu is suggesting that tha Zionist organisation of America is anti-British in order to damage it in the eyes of the British Government. The facts, however, seem to be rather the reverse.Labour Problems and Troubles.A report submitted to the Senate by the Secretary for Labour shows that 5,730,000 persons are unemployed in the United States. The number of unemployed is growing, and a winter of unexampled distress is in prospect.   In New York alone there are half, a million unemployed.Strike ballot-papers have been sent to the 400,000 members of tho four railway brotherhoods on the question of the acceptance or rejection of the order of the Railroad Labour Board reducing the wages bill by  30,000,000 annually.The United States Steel Corporation has decided to reduce the wages of its day labour seven cents per hour.Mr. Gompers has appealed to labour in tho countries which will participate in the Disarmament Conference to endeavour to have labour represented on the Delegations.The President has drafted a proclamation declaring martial law in the coal region of West Virginia, which is terrorised by bands of armed miners and other marauders. The proclamation refers to the movement of the miners as insurrectionary and threatens that failure to disband will entail dispersal by armed force. The attitude of the men is defiant. Heavy fighting has since been reported. 6,000 miners are opposing a force of almost equal strength, composed of State police, deputy sheriffs, and citizens. Military aid has been summoned. An effort to recruit a body of ex-Service men to fight the miners failed.The Movements of Senator France.Senator France and Mrs. Harrison left Riga for Berlin on the 2nd August. It is confidentially stated that the Senator has little real knowledge of the Russian situation and apparently expounds without question the misinformation given him by the Bolshevik leaders. He is carrying with him a large quantity of Bolshevik propaganda. Senator France will try to persuade the United States Government to recognise the Soviet&apos; Government do facto, as he hopes thereby to help them to continue their work.Notes on Extremists.Dr. N. S. Hardiker arrived in San Francisco in July with the inten-tion of going ou to New York and London and possibly to India. His views are milder he is. not now opposed to British rule in India and is dead against violence.According to the &quot;Daily Herald,&quot; George Andreitchine, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, who was sentenced to 20 years&apos; imprisonment, but managed to escape from America before his incarcera-tion, has arrived in Moscow, where he is serving as an American member of the executive of the Red Trade Union International.Louis C. Fraina, an Italian Jew, who is credited with the formation of the Communist Party of America in 1919, appears to be trying to enter the United States. Before lie devoted himself to Communism he was actively engaged in what was known as the left wing movement of the Socialist Party, of which he directed the official organ, the &quot;Revolu-tionary Age.&quot;   He is said to be a prolific writer and a man of no mean
intellectual ability. Since leaving America be has been in Russia, where he was in close touch with the Moscow Foreign Office and the Third International.Miscellaneous.A pamphlet written in Greek, which was found at Hull, England, deals with the troubles iu the American steel trade, and violently attacks tho steel companies and capitalists generally. It is a plea for membership of the Industrial Workers of the World.The anarchist publication &quot; Free Society &quot; appears to be issued by the Anarchist Communists formerly known as the Union of Russian Workers. The place of publication has never been definitely ascertained, but at present it appears to be issued in New England.Tho attempted boycott of British goods by Irish organisations has taken a new development.&quot; Women carrying placards exhorting purchasers to buy only American goods have been parading the shopping district of New York. The ringleader is a Mrs. Rita McNamara. Though the usual Irish camouflage that there is no organisation behind the campaign is employed, there is little doubt that it is of Irish origin. Mrs. McNamara admits that some 2,000 women are being recruited.11. CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES. MEXICO.The Liberal Constitutional Party in the Chamber of Deputies have proposed that the President should be asked that urgent measures be taken to deal,with the serious situation in Yucatan, &quot;where political assassinations are now the order of the day.&quot; The press states that Moscow has decided to establish in the State of Yucatan a general agency for propaganda in Latin America. It is also reported that a Mexican Commission of Labour leaders left the country to attend the Communist Congress in Moscow, aud that an active centre of Communist propaganda will probably be set up in Merida, the capital of the State of that name. There are rumours that a deputy of Congress was president of the Commission in question.Great friction exists between the Catholics and the Reds. In Morelia, for instance, the Reds have sworn to kill two Catholics daily, and iu Mexico City itself they have sworn to profane the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadaloupe and to kill the Archbishop. An astonishing story has reached New York that President Obregon threatened at a Cabinet meeting to execute three Archbishops as the only means of stopping their alleged activities against the Government. The cause of the trouble is that the Archbishops have protested against the promulga-tion of the Constitution of 1917 on the ground that it outlawed the funda-mental rights of Catholics.12. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. CHILE.The New Labour Code.The new and comprehensive labour code which has been drafted contains some 500 articles covering the industrial field. It recognises the right to strike, and prescribes severe measures for protecting the right to work of those who do not wish to strike. It provides for the creation of conciliation and arbitration courts to adjust differences between capital and labour and to eliminate strikes.    Labour is, however, reported to be
increasingly impatient at the failure of the Presidents pre-election promises to materialise.A movement is on foot to federato tho agricultural labourers and to bring them under the control of the Workmen&apos;s Central Federation. The danger of this is generally recognised. Tho National Society of Agri-culture, on behalf of the labourers, has indicated to the President the grievances of the labourers, and asked for improvements in their condition. In reply the President proposed a Ministry of Agriculture and legislation in the form of a labour code, and suggested conditions to landowners and to labourers alike. He appears to have dissatisfied the labourers by his advice against joining the General Federation, and the employers by his recommendation that the labourers should form local federations.Socialists in Congress.The two deputies for Antofagasta, Luis Recabarren and Victor Cruz, who are the first Socialists to be elected to Congress, have taken their seats. The judge who investigated the labour troubles at Antofagasta, now some considerable time ago, recommended that Recabarreu should be brought to trial, and that Congress should suspend his privilege of immunity as a deputy. There is little doubt that Recabarren instigated the movement which culminated in the massacre at the San Gregorio Nitrate Oficinas. He is one of the principal agitators in the North and has published a violently revolutionary pamphlet.THE ARGENTINE.A serious Soviet movement is said to have been discovered in the 20th Infantry at Jujny. The documents seized revealed an extensive Communist plot. The Anarchist Federations are also reported to have been active in Army circles. The principal centres are in Uruguay and Chile, where the work is less risky than in the Argentine. Jose Rugel-mann is one of the Argentine leaders, and took part in fomenting the violence at Forestal and Las Palmas works in the north and outrages in the south.The Argentine Communist Workers&apos; Federation has informed Tom Barker, who represents it in Moscow, that it repudiates centralisation, and refuses to accept the 21 points as a condition precedent of admission to the Red Trade Union International. If such a condition is insisted upon, Barker must withdraw. He is informed , more or less politely that he is a servant and not a master.
PART II.1. MOSCOW, THE WESTERN EUROPEAN SECRETARIAT AND THE BRITISH BUREAU OP THE RED TRADE UNION INTERNATIONAL.The firm John Lawrie &amp; Co., of Walker Lane, Tony, Aberdeen, and Vernon Mansions, 40, Shaftesbury Avenue, London, dealing mainly in its early days in scrap metal, but latterly in electrical and other appliances, acts as cover in the financing from abroad of the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International, whose centre is in Sheffield and whose principal officials are Albert Edward Booth, George Poet and Edward Lismer. 1The partners in the firm are (1) John Lawrie, private address, 87, Ashley Road, Aberdeen, about 40 years of age, a native of Peterhead. About 1911 he began business in Aberdeen on a small scale as a scrap metal merchant, his business prospering during the war till early in 1919 he bought the house in which he now resides. Formerly a preacher of extreme socialism, he no longer appears on the platform at Aberdeen, though he occasionally attends Communist meetings, carefully eschewing a prominent part.(2) Arthur Fraser Mackintosh, a town councillor, of 7, King&apos;s Crescent, Aberdeen, who also holds extreme Socialist views, began to work with Lawrie in the scrap metal business about 1916. Lawrie gave lip bis broker&apos;s licence to him in March 1920, since when the actual business has mainly been carried on by Mackintosh and Lawrie&apos;s son, formerly a bank clerk, who is responsible for the firm&apos;s clerical work, Lawrie himself taking a comparatively small part in the management.(3) Anton or Antonen Berate, stated variously to be a Czecho-Slovak and a native of Brittany, France. Born 28th April 1881, single, describes himself as general merchant. This man is in possession of a Czecho-Slovak passport; 40 years of age ; 5 ft. 8 ins. ; stout; full face ; imperial beard and moustache, otherwise clean-shaven. He is, as will appear below, the principal link between John Lawrie &amp; Co. and extremists abroad. He came to this country early in May of this year ; stayed at the Waldorf Hotel in London ; proceeded from there to Aberdeen, where he arrived on 10th May 1921, and stayed with Lawrie, leaving Aberdeen on the 18th May for the Waldorf Hotel, London, and finally leaving that address for Berlin on the 9th June 1921. During this visit Berate entered into partnership with Mackintosh and Lawrie in the firm of John Lawrie &amp; Co., and an arrangement was made with the Company&apos;s banks that cheques should be signed conjointly by any two of the partners in the business.(4) John Westermark. This man, who is married to a daughter of John Lawrie, and who resides with him at 87, Ashley Road, Aberdeen, is not a partner iu the firm, but conducts a certain amount of its corre-spondence and is known to be in its secrets and to be cognisant of the accounts of the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International. He was a munition worker during the war and is about 28 years of age, and came to Aberdeen from a situation in London at the end of 1920.Messrs. John Lawrie &amp; Co. bank with the North of Scotland and Town and County Bank, head office Aberdeen, and have also an accouut with Lloyds Bank, Limited, 22, Fenchurch Street,
Connection of Messrs. John Lawrie with the British Bureau of the Bed Trade Union International.On examination o  tlio banking accounts of Joint Lawrio and Company at Lloyds Bank, Fehehurch Street and at the North of Scotland and Town and County Bank Limited, Commercial Road branch, Aberdeen, it was found that when cheques were cashed in Aberdeen drawn upon Lloyds Bank, English notes were taken in payment. Unfortunately the Aberdeen bank had omitted to take their numbers and nothing further could be done. An examination of the Lloyds Bank account, however, ied to interesting disclosures. In. addition to amounts cashed in English notes by Lawrie himself in Aberdeen, there was a cheque for 2,500Z, dated April 19th, drawn in favour of W. S. Unkles on the Union Bank of Scotland. Stockwell Street, Glasgow, and a cheque for 850Z., drawn on May 17th in favour of one Fletcher, at the Yorkshire Penny Bank, Attercliffe, near Leeds.W. S. Unkles was not known to belong to the Communist Party, but was friendly with them because he hoped to trade in herrings with the Russian Government. The circumstances in which the cheque for 2,500Z. was cashed were as follows : on the afternoon of tho loth April, Unkles came to the Union Bank of Scotland, Stockwell Street, with John Lawrie. They explained that Lawrie had come from Aberdeen to London, and was held up on account of the railway strike, which threatened to take place that night. They requested the manager to cash the cheque for 2,500Z., Unkles guaranteeing Lawrie&apos;s identity and Lawrie producing his passbook, showing a balance standing there to his credit of 5,000Z. to 6,000Z. The manager answered he could not cash the cheque without first wiring the Lloyds Bank to satisfy himself that it would be honoured. This was agreed to. The cheque was made payable to Unkles and he endorsed it. On Monday, 18th April, Unkles called at the bank and received payment of the aheque, payment being made to him in 100Z. notes of the Union Bank of Scotland. Unkles then observed that the notes were going to Sheffield, but did not say for what purpose or to whom. Shortly thereafter, however, an examination of the account of George Peet, corresponding secretary of the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International in Manchester, disclosed a corre-sponding payment in 100Z. notes, which were later ascertained to have been notes of the Union Bank of Scotland.The cheque for 850Z. drawn on May 17th, by John Lawrie and Company on their account at Lloyds Bank, Fenchurch Street, in favour of Fletcher at the Yorkshire Penny Bank, Attercliffe, was paid out by that Bank to George Henry Fletcher of 67, Crinicar Lane, Sheffield, a prominent local extremist, who, on 9th June, was fined 50Z. or two months&apos; imprisonment (the latter of which he elected to serve) for making a speech at Rotherham on 29th May calculated to cause disaffec-tiou among the Rotherham police. This man, in February this year, had endeavoured to go to Germany and thence to Russia, but the German authorities refused him a visa, and in consequence he had never left the country. He cashed the cheque for 850Z., in two sums ; 100Z. on May 9th in 1Z. Treasury notes and ten 51. Bank of England notes, and 750/. on May 18th in 1Z. Treasury notes. When cashing the cheque he told the bank clerk, in the presence of the bank manager, that the money was required for strike pay.   This was during&apos; the miners&apos; strike.On the 15th June 1921 it was ascertained that certain bank notes had been issued to Lawrie &amp; Co. by Lloyd&apos;s Bank, Limited. Among these was the 5Z. Bank of England note No. A/25 17,414. On the 27th June information was received that this note had been received into the
headquarters branch of tbo Sheffield Banking Company, George Street, Sheffield. It bore an endorsement showing that it had passed through the account of the Brightside and Carsbrook Co-operative Society, Pagc-hall Branch, Drapery Department, Pagohall Road, Sheffield, and also bore what was proved to be a momber&apos;s trading number in that Society, 10,344. Confidential inquiry elicited that the member designated to that number was Elizabeth Ann Booth of 14, Lander Street, Sheffield, the wife of Albert Edward Booth, Financial Organiser of the Provisional International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions.More recently three additional lots of bauk notes paid out to John Lawrie &amp; Co. on the 7th June 1921 by Llovd&apos;s Bank, Limited, viz., 20/. notes 19/M 27,743/5 and 10/. notes, 75/fc. 96,122/31 and 75/K. 96,138/9, were traced into the hands of E. Lismer, Organising Secretary of the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International, who paid them to the Wayfarers&apos; Travel Agency, Geoffrey Franklin, 31, Alfred Place, W.C., to furnish letters of credit for H. Pollitt, Ellen Wilkinson, Forster, and other Red Trade Union International extremists on that mission to the Congress of the Red Trade Union International in Moscow, from which the remnant, who havo not succumbed to railway accidents and disease, has now returned.Three distinct financial transactions have therefore been traced between Messrs. John Lawrie &amp; Co. and the officials of the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International in Sheffield, while one instance of the financial support by that firm of strikers in this country has also been brought to light.This connection of the firm with tho British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International is considerably strengthened, by the intimacy of Lawrie, Mackintosh, &amp; Co., with a British revolutionary named Ian MacPherson of 21,Nelfield Place, Aberdeen, who receives correspondence c/o A. E. Booth, Financial Organiser of the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International, and is an important member of the Bureau&apos;s Publicity Committee.The Relations of John Lawrie &amp; Co. with Agents of the organisations of the Communist International in Berlin.The credit side of the account of John Lawrie &amp; Co. ou Lloyd&apos;s Bank, Fenchurch Street branch, was scarcely less interesting than the debit.   For the most part credits were paid in up to May 17th in dollar notes, 10,000 of which were paid in ou December 20th, shortly after John Murphy had returned from Russia via Berlin and the Red Trade Union International had been formed in this country.   A further sum of 15,260 dollars was paid in on April 19th ; dollar notes are untraceable and pass from hand to hand virtually until they fall to bits.   A cheque for 5,000/. on the Swiss Banking Corporation London, E.C., and signed Carsch, Simon &amp; Co., Mohrenstrasse, Berlin.   The account of Carsch, Simon &amp; Co., at the Swiss Banking Corporation showed a payment in drafts from Berlin which has proved untraceable.   Investigations in Berlin, however, with regard to Anton Beratz, whose connection with one Friedrich Feyerherd, 2, Mauerstrasse, Berlin, had been established by an intercepted letter, led to exceedingly interesting-oresults.   The Feyer-herd family had been fugitives from East Prussia and arrived in Berlin in the winter of 1916.   Their shop in the Mauerstrasse deals in stoves and electric fittings, but it has no customers and the business has been discovered to be a cloak for propaganda and courier activity.   The shop is run by one Carl Fcyerhcrd with his son, Friedrich Feyerherd, and his nephew Franz Feyerherd,   There are also two daughters, Freda and
Martha. It was established that Anton Beratz had at one time, under the name of Sturm, frequented Karl Feyerberd. Beratz cheated the elder Feyerhord in some way and their friendship ceased. That Beratz had continued his relations with Friedricb, the son of Karl Feyerherd, is proved by the fact that it was a telegram from either Lawrie, Macintosh or Ian MacPherson, sent at the request of a person signing him or herself &quot; Esther&quot; and writing from the Mauerstrasse address which brought Anton Beratz to this country in April last. It would appear, therefore, that though Beratz is reported no longer to be in friendly relations with the father he has maintained an intimate and confidential connection with the son.Now Karl Feyerherd is known and reported by the German Goveru-ment to be a courier in the employ of the German United Communist Party and the German Government states that there is no doubt that in this capacity Feyerherd has close connections with the Soviet Mission in Berlin and with the Third International in Moscow.Particular interest attaches to the alias Sturm under which Anton Beratz was formerly known to Karl Feyerherd. It was reported in June that Feyerherd was a pseudonym for Samuel Marcovitz Sachs, alias Sturm, formerly Soviet State Secretary for Commerce, more recently in charge of their Printing Department, who had resided in Reval for some time. This Sachs alias Sturm had in September, 1920, been elected principal director of propaganda in Germany. It is known that he had been in custody in Berlin and liberated after a short period of imprison-ment. When matters became too hot for his liking in Berlin he decamped to one of the larger cities in the North of Germany where he took an active part in the organisation and execution of Spartacist disturbances and the distribution of propaganda. In view of the intimacy of Beratz with the two Feyerherds, it seems just possible that Anton Beratz, the partner of John Lawrie, known to the Feyerherds as Sturm alias Beratz, may be identical with Sachs alias Sturm and may have, for convenience sake, at some time taken the name of his friends, the Feyerherds, as a further alias. This possibility is strengthened by the fact that among the agents recently subordinated to Jacques Sadoul on his taking over of the direction of the West European Secretariat for communist propaganda, occurs the name of one Sachs, who may well be identical with Samuel Marcovitz Sachs alias Sturm.Intercepted communications have proved that Arthur Fraser Macintosh, the partner of John Lawrie and Beratz, and Ian MacPherson, the friend of the firm and of George Peet of the Red Trade Union International, are also in relations with the Feyerherds, though the presence of neither has hitherto been detected at the shop, 2, Mauerstrasse, Berlin. Both, however, travel pretty frequently to and from Berlin.Interest in A.nton Beratz and in his firm, Messrs. John Lawrie &amp; Co., has quite recently been much enhanced by a letter, dated Paris, 14th June, and addressed by one V. Prihodko to the Agitation Section, Bolskaya Dmitrovka, 15, Moscow. This letter is stated to be addressed to one Taratoulla, a Ukrainian working in the Foreign Office, Moscow, who may be identical with a personage named Taratouta who was, in the earlier months of this year, reported to be coming to England as the organiser of a system of Communist agents. The writer of the letter states that, on the previous day, he had seen &quot; Antoine Barrass, who is going to England to replace Fachers.&quot; Fachers has been known to us as the English representative at the Secret Conference of the Communist Party held at Sachsa in the Hartz Mountains on December 24th, 1920. He is now stated in the letter to have been the principal organiser for the Red International in Great Britain, a statement largely confirmed by
signatures on Communist doeumeuts intercepted iu the country. The writer of the letter to Moscow says that Ban-ass intends to repair the mistakes made by Fachers in England, where the latter concentrated his attention exclusively on the organisation of the mining districts and the workers cf the heavy industrials, remaining entirely indifferent to the newly created Union of Seamen. Barrass will probably take up his abode in Cardiff where Fachers lived, but he considers it necessary to establish one of the chief bureaux besides Plymouth in Bristol or Exeter, as those two towns are the most convenient for establishing constant connections aud communications with the seamen of the commercial fleet. Barrass himself, who, from this letter and in the covering report, seems to be a native of Brittany, is full of hopes and energy, but the writer is afraid that the activism with which he is so completely saturated may lead him to commit indiscretions undesirable in the present situa-tion of Great Britain. There are indications in the letter that Barrass is also engaged in the transmission of literature to Ireland.This letter bears all the marks of authenticity. The &quot; newly created Union of Seamen &quot; is known and its secretary at Hamburg, Otto Rieger, is known to be a principal intermediary for dispatching secret Bolshevik agents to this country. Details in the letter correspond exactly with information received from domestic sources as to the foreign organisations here, and certain documents interpreted in the new light not only confirm the information supplied but will, it is thought, considerably extend and unify our knowledge of the machinations of the International of Red Trade Unions in this country.Anton Beratz, in his journey to England in April and May last, was the bearer of Czecho-Slovak passport No. 70630 granted at Berlin on the 14th April 1921. The fact that no such number was issued by the Berlin Office makes it more than probable that this passport is a forgery. On this count, as well as others, Anton Beratz has now been circulated in the UK. for arrest. He is believed recently to have attended the conference of the unemployed at Jena and may go on after a short stay in Germany to the so-called Kissingen Conference in Czecho-Slovakia. The German authorities have been told about his movements and given the gist of his activities, and it is believed that they will co-operate in effecting his arrest. Quite recent information indicates that Beratz is not now in .such favour with the Central Executive Committee of the Third International as he was earlier- in the year. In a document dated the ] 3th August and intercepted between Moscow and the Propaganda Department of the Western European Secretariat in Berlin the activity of Beratz is noted as having for some time not been remarkable for that energy and resolution which at the moment of his appointment seemed likely, and it is suggested by the Agitation Department that, should he not produce satisfactory explanations, the Secretariat should signify their desire for a candidate to replace him.Meanwhile, the premises of the firm of John Lawrie &amp; Company in Aberdeen and London, as well as John Lawrie&apos;s private address in both centres, have been searched and John Lawrie and Arthur Fraser Mac-intosh separately interviewed. Compromising documents were found at 87, Ashley Road, Aberdeen, John Lawrie&apos;s private address. The courage of the partuers rather evaporated under interrogation. The spectacle of Lawrie aud Macintosh each simultaneously shifting the blame for their connection with&apos;Beratz on to the shoulders of the other showed that the solidarity inculcated by Communism tends, in its application, to be universal rather than familiar.o  15935 .

A SOVIET RUSSIAN REVIEW OF THE SITUATION AND PROSPECTS IN THE NORTHERN CAUCASUS.The following report on the situation in the Northern Caucasus is condensed from.the original by Pavlovich, political commissary of the Second Soviet Army and member of a special Revolutionary Commission sent to carry out an investigation in that area by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. It is remarkable for its indication that local Communists look to the religious community of the Dukhobors for an example, both moral and material, which may enable the demoralised population to stave off the disaster , during the coming winter.The district of the northern Caucasus, embracing the Terskaya, Kuban and Stavropol territories, from the time of the October revolution was a fertile ground for all counter-revolutionary conspiracies. It is now one of the most loyal areas in the Soviet Republic.The turbulent elements little by little became reconciled by the inevitable failure of the various minor risings and disturbances which took place.The- object of the Soviet Government, restored in the Northern Caucasus after the final liquidation of Denikin, consisted mainly in endeavouring to reconcile two hostile elements of the population in the-Cossack territories the native Cossacks and non-Cossack peoples. The Cossacks, extremely clannish and united by long standing traditions, considering that the territory which had been given to them as a reward for their services should remain exclusively their own, regarded immigrant settlers as an unnecessary and even harmful element forcibly thrust upon them for the purpose of disorganising their Cossack life and impairing their material prosperity.* Representing the Commissariat for War.
Non-Cossacks could only secure a plot of ground to cultivate from each particular stanitsa or Cossack village, on lease. Though insignifi-cant compared with the land of the Cossacks, such estates were always a subject of disputes and protests on the part of the latter, who regarded them as an attempt to dismember the wealthy Cossack organisations through a non-Cossack element.- The first settlers in the Kuban earned their livelihood as farm labourers to rich Cossacks. Gradually they settled down in the villages and began to lease small plots, first of Imperial land and then from the Cossack &quot; Voisko.&quot; The Cossacks held an average of 15 dessiatines a family and so could sell half their holdings or more to landless Batraks. Cossack villages were gradually filled with immigrants from Governments where land was difficult to get. These dependants, known as Taurians hated the Cossacks and their privileges. Afterwards called &quot; Inogerodnie &quot; or &quot; men of other towns &quot; at the outbreak of revolution they formed the great majority of the population in Kuban, outnumbering the Kuban Cossacks by three to one.The reasons of their hatred were economic. In the Kuban 79 per cent, of the laud was held by the Cossack &quot; Voisko,&quot; the Church and the Imperial Chancellery : only 21 per cent, was hekl by the &quot; Inogerodnie.&quot; So that the October revolution found the Cossack territories of the Northern Caucasus divided into hostile camps, the enmity between which served the initiators of volunteer formations against the Soviet Govern-ment.The position of the Northern Caucasus Republics in July 1921 is favourable for the further development of the social reforms of the Soviet Republic. Notwithstanding the failure of the harvest in the Western part of the northern Caucasus, notwithstanding the epidemics threatening from the north-east, this territory, one of the richest in the Soviet Republic, will soon be both the granary of the Federated Republics of the north and the cultural seeding ground for practical Communism for the whole nation. Three years of civil war have cleared the territory of turbulent elements. The petty warfare in the mountains maintained by those who strive for Cossack traditions is developing into banditism. The appeals of White agents are distrusted by the remnants of the Cossack peoples.But the economic position is not brilliant. The large farms, organised in accordance with the latest demands of agricultural technique, have been almost entirely destroyed during the civil war. The complete absence of agricultural equipment and only very casual supply of labour has rendered their transfer to the local communes fruitless. Tillage by the Red Army succeeded in places, aud sowing of crops w.as completed, but for the most part a harvest cannot be reckoned on in these districts for they have suffered most from the drought.* The small holdings of the non-Cossack population have remained intact, but the inadequacy of their agricultural equipment precludes any increase in tillage. The senseless administration of minor officials of the Commissariat for Food, the irregular execution and inelasticity of plans for distribution frustrate the efforts of the administrative organisations, who, together with the army staff on the Caucasus front, are working hard to avert disaster in the coming winter.The Rostov Department of the Commissariat for Foreign Trade has not only never once assisted the conclusion of contracts between foreign contractors and the administration in the territories, but has failed to arrange for the arrival of the required commodities, and its conduct has* Note by D. of X. By the end of August the Soviet Government had issued a map showing the north-western and north-eastern Caucasus as a famine area, and the Northern Caucasus as an area in which the harvest had been below the average.
been such that foreign contractors decline to discuss business with it. The complete equipment required to restore old farms and start new cannot be had. The communes, far from extending their work and introducing improvements, scarcely satisfy their own most elementary demands. Only the communes of the Dukhobors, who have developed remarkably in the Maikop area, can be said to flourish. Notwithstanding the gulf which separates them from us, work with the organisations of the Dukhobor communities has had such a satisfactory influence on our young Communists, the example set by the Dukhobors is so important, that the Government Commissary considers it its duty to permit these religious communities to develop their organisations, giving them a support equal to that accorded to the communes. Only by this means will the Kuban and the Northern Caucasus be in a position to cope with the failure of the harvest and to survive the coming winter.Printed by Eyrb and SrOTTiswooDi, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.c. i.
