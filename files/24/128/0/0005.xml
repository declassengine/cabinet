jyfais Boo^raeait is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentJPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1921.SECRET.C.P.-3305.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF  THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 5th instant.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.Except for the continuance of the disturbances in Belfast the country generally has been peaceful and the breaches of the truce reported have, with one exception, been of a comparatively trivial character. In this case a party of the Irish Republican Army took forcible possession of an unoccupied house on the estate of Sir &quot;Jocelyn Gore-Booth (a near relative, of Countess Markewicz), Lissadel, Sligo District. They moved in bedding, which it is believed they took from the Sligo District Asylum, stocked the place with provisions, and are reported to be carrying out target practice. Other outrages reported include three robberies from Post Offices and a raid on a mail car. In the latter case the raiders were surprised by an unarmed party of Police, who succeeded in arresting two of the offenders and in recovering some of the stolen mails. The motive for these offences is, however, not regarded as political. A case of kidnapping is reported from Kanturk, co. Cork, where a woman of 40 years of age was taken-away by six armed civilians, and up to the present has not been traced.Disturbances in Belfast.Party disturbances were renewed in Belfast on the 31st August. Workers proceeding to the shipyards in the morning were fired at, and sniping continued in several areas throughout the day. The total casualties amounted to 7 killed and 40 wounded, the number of Catholic and Protestant victims being apparently about equal. In view of the very serious state of the city, the military were called out in greater numbers and effectively patrolled the dangerous areas, with the result that on the 1st instant the disturbances had died down. Since that date there has been a number of isolated cases; of sniping and assault, but fortunately unattended by serious results. Party feeiing, however, still runs very high, and the utmost vigilance is being used to prevent a further outbreak.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Two trials by court-martial were concluded during the week, the accused in each case being Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary. Sentence of imprisonment without hard labour for 1 year was imposed in the case of one of the Constables found guilty of the manslaughter of a woman, and sentence of 1 month without hard labour in the other case on a charge of manslaughter of a Constable.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 3rd instant: Total orders made ... ... ... ...      4,245Orders cancelled for reasons other than release        155 Releases ordered ... ... ... ...       423--        578Number of persons now interned . ... ... ...      3,667The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 26.

One effect of Mr. de Valera&apos;s letter has been to accentuate the desire for an early conference. This desire found terse expression in the &quot; Freeman&apos;s Journal &quot;*on the 7th instant: &quot; The writing of long letters should cease,&quot;- it said in the course of a leading article, &quot; .... a few hours&apos; plain talk would, we feel confident, clear the whole situation.&quot;H.
