CP. 5310.CABINET IRISH SEETLEI/jSNT,MEMORAICDUM BY THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY.I circulate,- for the Information of the Cabinet, the attached Memorandum setting out the. Naval conditions which the Board of Admiralty suggest should be incorporated in any Irish settlement.(initialled) L of P.16th September, 1921.
ME&amp;RANDtlM OF SUGGESTS NAVAL CONDITIONS in connectIon with the proposals for an Irish settlement.In order to guard against all possible contingencies, and to show for all time that the agreement between Great &apos; Britain and. Ire-land clearly recognises the vital principle that whatever status Ireland nay enjoy nothing can fetter the Royal Navy in its complete freedom of action in Irish waters, the Board of Admiralty urge that condition (I) of the 6 conditions mentioned in the Prime &quot;Minister1 s letter of 20th July be inserted in full in the preamble of the agreement to he drawn up between Groat Britain&quot; and Ireland,     Ihat condition is as followsThe Common concern o? Great Britain and Ireland in tho defence of their interests by land and soa shall be mutually recognised.   Great Britain lives by sea-borne food; her cdnriunications depend upon the freedom of the great sea routes.    Iroland lies at Britain&apos;s side across the sea-ways north and south that link her vrlth the sistor nations of the Smpir-3, the markets of the world . and. the vital sources of a or food supply.    In recognition of this fact, which nature has imposed and no statesmanship can change, it Is essential that the Royal Navy alone should control the seas around Ireland and Great Britain, and that such ri?hts and liberties should be accorded to it by the Irish State as are essential for naval purposes in the Irish harbours and on the Irish coasts.Whilst the principle in this condition should bo embodied in the preamble, tho Board are of opinion that In the text of any,;.new constitutional document a provision should also be made- bringing out in some detail the status of the Royal Navy on the Irish coast.   A draft of such a provision is contained in paragraph 2 p  of this memorandum.2* . Owing; to the geographical position of Ireland, it is essential that the following Naval conditions should be borne in mind and, included in any new Constitution Document:-(a)
(a) Such rights and liberties shall be accorded to the Royal Navy by the Irish State as are essential for Naval; purposes in the Irish, harbours and on the Irish coasts . Measures of Nevel defence, the preservation of order and the carrying out of any legislation affecting Irish waters that require a floating Armed force shall be carried out by the Royal Navy, and no Naval force or armed vessels may be maintained by the Irish State, whilst at the same time voluntary recruitment for any Naval force authorised by the Imperial Government will be permitted throughout Ireland. The Irish State shall not have power to make laws In respect of the Navy or any Naval force or any Naval matter: the King&apos;s Ships ,of War, Royal Fleet Auxiliaries and Dockyard Craft shall be exempt from Irish legislation.(b) &apos;  As regards Submarine Cables and Wireless Telegraphy, the Irish State shall not grant permission for the landing of submarine cables or the establishment of wireless stations for communication with places outside Ireland without the concurrence of the Imperial Government. ,They shall continue the existing cable landing rights and. wireless concessions.The Imperial Government shall have the right to land additional submarine cables or to establish additional wireless stations for communication with places outside Ireland, and the Irish State shall, if desired, accord similar facilities to Telegraph Companies upon such conditions as may be recommended by the Imperial Government,The Imperial Government shall control all cables and wireless stations in Ireland in time of war.(SO It shall be provided that power shall be reserved to His Majesty to confer on the Naval, Military or Air Force Authorities of the United Kingdom, control over any harbours, lighthouses and vessels, buoys, beacons, or other navigational marks, or any navigational aids to such extent at such times and in such circumstances as may appear to His Majesty to be required in the National interests in times of war or emergency.C^r) Lighthouses, buoys, beacons, and any navigationalmarks or navigational aids shall be maintained as at present and not removed without the consent of the Imperial Government given through a Secretary of State, whose concurrence is also to be obtained for the establishment of others.September 16th, 1921.
