Company Bedfords arrived Bezwada 10.00 hours, and report all quiet there.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 15tk September 1921. Clear the line.Malabar disturbances. On Oth September we asked Madras Government to take all possible measures to ensure close touch being maintained between civil and military authorities in martial law administration, and requested prompt report to us of cases of improper orders or wrong exercise of power. We also enquired whether troops were sufficient, aud what local Governments views were regarding probable date of termination of martial law. Following is local Governments reply dated 14th September: &quot; In the light of information elicited during visit of His Excellency the Governor of Madras to Malabar, and subsequent information regarding military situation, position now clearly appears more serious than Avas hoped. Spirit of rebellion is unbroken. - Except close to railway and in immediate vicinity of troops, life and j)roperty of non-Muhammadans unsafe. Bridges and roads repaired by troops are broken after they have passed. Office of Sub-Registrar at Mannarghat was destroyed on the 12th. Interior of Ernadd and Walluvanad (? Taluks) still in hands of rebels, of whom five bodies are known to be in existence with a total strength estimated at 3,000. Owing to their mobility and our difficulties regarding transport, communications and intelligence, military are experiencing difficulties in dealing with them. Please refer to telegram of 13th September from General Officer Commanding, Wellington, to Chief of the General Staff, Simla, No. S. 250/227/G. Local Governments have been compelled to oppose suggestion of moving troops from Madras to Malabar area, and have also been obliged to ask for a detachment of British troops to be sent from Secunderabad to Bezwada. It appears therefore to local Government that troops in Malabar are insufficient. It is impossible to 4631      100   9.21
re-establish police at stations, still more so to re-open ordinary courts and offices or even to ascertain extent of damage done to public and private property. All that is possible at present is to maintain close association between Civil and Military Authorities, and to provide for trial of those arrested for serious offences. A relief fund has been started by Collector of Malabar, but its administration will be imprae-ticablo till normal conditions are restored. Piease note that trials that have taken place are for what -would be offences against ordinary law in normal times, such as robbery, extortion, dacoity, arson, damage to railway and telegraphs, and not merely for any (? produced by) special regulations. It Las not been possible to take many wounded rebels prisoners, but those few captured are being looked after in exactly the same Avay as our men. It is quite impossible at present to forecast when it will be practicable to terminate martial law.&quot;Military telegram quoted : &quot; The following report is from Officer Commanding, Malabar: On the 12th September the (? Moplahs&apos;) activity increased. There are .15 rebel bands at large, their total strength being about 3,(300. Two of them are in neighbourhood of Manjeri, and the rest are about Nilambur, Nannarakkad and Melattur. Disposition of troops on 12t3i September was as follows : Military head-quarters of Malabar and Supply, Railhead, Tirur. Two platoons 04th Pioneers, Tirur. One platoon 83rd Infantry, engaged in making arrests near Tirur. Two platoons 04th Pioneers, Ollavamot. Second Dorsetshire Regiment, Headquarters, and one company, Malapuram. One company less two platoons, Perintalmanna. One platoon, Maimarghat. One (? company), Wanclur: One company and one platoon, Pandik Kad. One company and one platoon, Leinster Regiment, Calicut.

Walluvanad) at 11 hours to-day (13th September) for Tirur in response to a request for reinforcements. The Officer Commanding, Malabar, has, however, been instructed not to draw on the Suffolk Regiment unless he cannot dispense with them, and to send tho company back to (? Walluvanad) as soon as circumstances allow.Officer Commanding, Malabar, has the 83rd Light Infantry at Cannauore at his disposal, and if that is inadequate, I will bring more of the 64th Pioneers from Bangalore. Two companies of the Dorsetshire Regiment are proceeding at 8 a.m. to-day (13th September) to Helatuir to deal with a band of Moplahs, 800 strong.On the 11 tk September His Excellency the Governor of -Madras presided at a conference at Tirur, at which there was a thorough discussion of the administration of martial law under the Ordinance.Also on the 11th and 12th the General Officer Commanding paid a visit to Malapuram. The main military difficulty lies in following the intentions and the movements of the rebels, and in the transmission of information. We have now established good signal communications.From Viceroy, Home Department, 11th September 1921. Clear the line.Moplah disturbances. In view of Gandhi&apos;s expected arrival in Madras, Officer Commanding, Malabar, issued martial law order restraining him from entering or staying in martial law area. Order was endorsed by General Officer Commanding, Madras District, who asked for orders of Government of Madras as to whether it should hold good, stating, in his opinion, essential it should. Government of Madras, in view of conditions prevailing in area, approved, and Gandhi was informed of order probably ou journey to Madras. If he enters martial law area, he will be stopped at Tirur, and sent back with escort to outside limit of area. Expected to arrive Madras to-day. AVe discussed matter in. Council this morning, and as Civil and Military authorities both agreed that Gandhi should be kept out of martial law area, we have approved externment order, and method of enforcing it, and have informed Madras accordingly.
