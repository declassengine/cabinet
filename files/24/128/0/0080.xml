[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet. . October 1921.SECRET.CP. 3301CABINET, -AFGHANISTAN.1 circulate to my colleagues copies of telegrams received from the Viceroy with regard to Afghanistan.E. S. M.5th October 1921.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, &apos; 27th September-1921,(Received 28th, 10 a.m.)Clear the line.2273 S.   Following from Dobbs, 306 C, dated 25th September ;--&quot; Amir asked me to see him privately to-day. Nawab aud I accordingly conferred for eight hours with Amir and (? General Muhammad corrupt group-Sami), at time there being no representative of the Foregn Office. After complaining of Wali&apos;s reception, Amir insisted on discussing exclusive treaty in spite of my continual protests that this was waste of time, as exclusive treaty was dead and buried. Amir said that it was my insistence on previous consultation regarding treaty with Third Powers that had prevented him from signing, and that, if this was modified, he was ready to sign exclusive treaty now, I pointed out, again that this was impossible as he had ratified treaty with Russia. He replied that he had been forced into treaty with. Russia by our attitude regarding treaties with Third Powers, and-, if we would specify class of question requiring previous consultation, he would cancel treaty with russia and sign exclusive treaty with following alterations : &quot; (? First, omitted.) Clause 4. British Consulate to be at Jalalabad only, so as not to make it appear as if British were monopolising prohibited Eastern zone, regarding which clause 6 would then stand.&quot;Second.   Clause 15.   Modification on lines indicated above.&quot;Third. Promise regarding rupture with Russia. Afghanistan must be given longer time after delivery of arms than 15 days, which was originally suggested, but not approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government, as Amir must have time to arrange for defence of northern frontier.Amir saijl he would not have gentlemanly treaty at any price, and, if we could -not accept these proposals, there was nothing for it but for us to leave without any treaty.&quot;Dobbs&apos; comments are awaited.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 29th September 1921.(Received 5 p.m.).Clear the line.2278 S. Following is second and last part, dated 27th September, of Dobbs&apos; 306 C. :-&quot; He could cancel treaty with Russia over question of independence of Bokhara. He had received boxes full of Russian gold, but he preferred British friendship to Russian gold. In vain I pointed out as plainly as I dared astounding perfidy of the course which Amir proposed and fact that gentlemanly treaty left door open to gradual development of friendship without (sic ? with) us. I said Bolsheviks must soon collapse, and he would.know what opportunity (? omission) of escaping from his -entanglements too. I asked, did he seriously ask me to telegraph his proposals to His Majesty&apos;s Government. He replied, &apos; yes.&apos; I then said, I must have time to think, and would see him again to-morrow, when we might be able to get our ideas 4700     100  10.21 A
clearer. He asked me to say nothing to Tarsi, who. he alleged, does not know of this proposal. Amir said he had no intention of ratifying the treaty with Angora, which had been drafted without his authority.&quot;Foregoing summary, of course, does not fully convey lengthy arguments used-, in our eight hours&apos; conversation. My own feeling (? is omitted) that it is impossible for Great Britain to involve herself in such discreditable transactions. If Amir tears in pieces the treaty with Russia six weeks after ratification, and after receiving the subsidy, he could equally well tear up ours. We should never be safe with him. Amir met this argument, which he saw was in my mind, by saying that cancellation of the treaty with Russia would make friendship with Russia impossible.&quot; He said that he had no intention of ratifying the Turkish treaty, which had been drafted entirely without his authority.&quot; I fear we must now face the choice between consideration of Amir&apos;s proposal and complete rupture negotiations, since Amir will not evidently listen to any comparatively petty modification of the gentlemanly treaty, such as the prohibition of Consulate, in exchange for Customs concessions, &amp;c.&quot; T recommend that we persist in presenting the gentlemanly treaty and face the consequences.i! I beg that, if Government of India do not wish to decide themselves, they will -send me immediately preliminary expression of their own views.   In the meantime, I hope to get the Amir to-morrow to set forth his proposals quite definitely.&quot;From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 30th September 1921.(Received 7 p.m.)Clear the line.2292- S.   Following from Dobbs, 307 C, dated 28th September, first part :-&quot; Amir, quite alone, received Nawab and me this afternoon.  He has now clarified his ideas as follows :  &apos;; &quot; (1) He will repudiate treaty with Russia as soon as the (? 20,000) rifles, delivered under exclusive treaty by British, can be transported to Turkestan frontier, say six weeks after their delivery.    &quot;&quot; (2) He will undertake to receive no arms, munitions, aeroplanes or money from Russia, ;md will return what he has already received.&quot; (3) If Russia does not break off relations owing to his repudiation of present treaty, he is to be at liberty to make a fresh neighbourly treaty with Russia providing for only exchange of diplomatic representatives and commercial products.&quot; (4) British assurance(s) of support in the event of unprovoked Russian aggression to be same as before, but minimum amount of help in shape of additional munitions and money the British would give in the event of actual hostilities must be clearly -stated. i    - ,.. *  :&quot; (5) Munitions, &amp;c, to be delivered on signature of treaty to be same as before, except that 1,000 roimds per rifle should be given instead of 200, and 12 aeroplanes instead of six. Of these aeroplanes not less than four to be delivered immediately, in order to give confidence to people, and remainder when possible.&quot; (6) Arrangements about exclusion of consuls (of) third Powers and one British consul (? to be) same as in my telegram of the 26th September, 306.&quot; (7) Conditions about matters relating to India to be removed from clause 3 so that Afghan diplomatic representative may be on precisely same footing as those of other States.&quot; (8) Some verbal alterations in clause 14 so as to make it less obviously directed against Afghanistan alone.&quot;Second and third parts not yet received owing to atmosphere.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 30th September 1921.(Received 1st October, 10 a.m.)Clear the line.Following telegram has been received from Dobbs, 307 O, 2nd and 3rd parts,, dated 28th September, just received : &quot; 9. Clause 15, last sentence, to be omitted and replaced by undertaking on the part of Afghanistan&quot;to give no exclusive rights in Afghanistan to Russia or to any
other State, person, firm or company known to be under the influence of Russia for public works, public service, commercial exploitation, and-the like, and on the part of British Government not to make with third Power, without consultation, any treaty or understanding affecting the status of Afghanistan or the relations of that Power with Afghanistan, or binding said Power to aid British in event of hostilities with Afghanistan, or binding British to attempt to restrain Afghanistan from activity in, Asia. Neither Government to enter into offensive alliance against the other. Amir&apos; spoke at great length of his preference for British friendship, and enlarged upon misdeeds and bad faith of Russia, but said he must make friends with Russia with his eyes open if he could not receive assurances and help mentioned from us, and (? guarantees) against infringement of his independence, which amendments in treaty suggested by him would furnish.   I told him quite frankly that &quot; (a) I doubt whether British Government would feel sufficiently sure of Afghanstability of purpose to allow interval suggested between delivery ofmunitions and denunciation of treaty with Russia; &quot; (6) I did not think treaty allowing Russian representative at Kabul would beregarded as sufficiently clean cut; &quot; (c) I believed that immediate provision of four aeroplanes would be impossible ; &quot; (ti) I understood that views of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding clause 3.were so strong that his demands under this head alone would probablywreck proposed arrangement.Amir replied that he had thought matter out very carefully, and could yield on none of these points. Unfortunately he could not show thoughts of his heart by Rontgen rays, and we must trust him. His views of clause 3 especially were unalter-able, owing to Wali incident in London.&quot; I said that if Amir insisted, I would report these proposals to my Government) but I had exceedingly little hope of their acceptance. Amir replied that, if I would do so, and they were accepted, he would sit with me alone, and settle each clause of treaty, and would then cause his assembly to accept them. I then said that, as foregoing proposals would probably be inacceptable, I would suggest compromise regarding gentlemanly treaty, namely, customs concession in return for exclusion of Consuls, and undertaking not to interfere with tribes in return for unfettered transport of arms and ammunition through India. Amir absolutely refused to contemplate any arrangement of the sort. - He said that he wanted either modified exclusive treaty as sketched, above or nothing. In the event of no treaty, he sincerely hoped that we need not quarrel.   I replied that I thought it almost inevitable that we should.&quot; I do not believe the.Amir is bluffing, and he.seemed to Nawab and me to be sincere in his present mood. I think that there is a good chance that he might carry out the foresaid promise(s), and if he repudiates the treaty with Russia, I do not see (? how he omitted) can place himself in their hands again. But I can hardly believe that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to take risk of malting the concessions involved.   No further comment from me seems necessary.&quot;I should add that Amir said spontaneously he could not now accept even latest Afghan version of pis alter, especially clause about diplomatic representation, and that he would not consent to change in clause.&quot; . , .Our comments follow.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, &quot;mil September 1921.(Received 1st October, 8 a.m.)Clear the li ne.2290 S.   Dobbs&apos; 306 C. and 307 C. of which first part has been received.Amir&apos;s latest and most bewildering volte face is presumably to be traced to Ghulam Sadik&apos;s report on European conditions. If Amir had not publicly ratified Soviet treaty, and had not accepted 500,000 roubles of the Russian subsidy, our course would have been clear for exclusive treaty. As it is we feel with Dobbs that we cannot involve ourselves in so discreditable and dangerous a business as the Amir proposes. Afghan provocation to Russia Avould be so flagrant that we could not undertake by treaty with unmistakable reference to Russia &quot; to render Afghanistan.
assistance in the. event of any unprovoked aggression by a third Power &quot; (clause 1 Of exclusive treaty), still less send up arms to Afghanistan in advance. Nor until the Soviet treaty which we have publicly pilloried is publicly denounced by Amir could we by treaty accept Afghan assurance that &quot;it has not entered into any treaty, agreement or undertaking with a third party directed against interests &quot; of ourselves-(clause 15). ...On the other hand, Dobbs gives us clear warning that it is a choice between Amir&apos;s proposals and rupture, as Amir will not look at gentlemanly treaty at any price. At present moment I should regret rupture perhaps more than at &quot;any previous time, for the internal situation is for the moment Muslim rather than Hindu in character and rupture with Afghanistan might have most serious consequences,, whereas Afghan settlement might go considerable way to easing situation.&apos; If, then, we cannot entertain Amir&apos;s proposals, and if he will not entertain ours, is there no middle course ? To us it seems clear that Amir is most anxious to secure treaty with us, and only rejects gentlemanly treaty because in his eyes it, would give him nothing and would set up awkward precedent for future treaties with us. We think we should take immediate advantage of Amir&apos;s attitude and strike home forcibly and rapidly. Dobbs should tell him plainly that His Majestys Government cannot, entertain his proposals, that by his delay and actions he has lost his opportunity for large concessions from us-, but that, if he makes forthwith full disclosure of Russian treaty and its supplement, we will give him his last chance of standing in with the one great Power who alone can assist in Afghanistan&apos;s political development, and of receiving like his father and grandfather before him treaty and subsidy from us. He should be given seven days only in which to make his choice. ,-      &apos;&quot;Situation is so perplexing that we think that Dobbs should be allowed consider-able.latitude in putting our proposals to Amir. It should be left to him to judge whether pis oiler should be presented in its present form, or whether Amir&apos;s attitude gives us opportunity for diminishing our concessions and emphasising our demands. We ourselves incline to the view that the Amir&apos;s attitude implies on the one hand that we need pay less to secure his good will; and on the other hand, that he will of his own motion sterilize Bolshevik activities in Afghanistan, provided we continue to keep up our connection with her. On this reasoning it might be tactically as well as practically advantageous to ctit down the pis aller concessions by excising grant of telegraph material and reducing arms and customs concessions to those in the gentlemanly treaty. At the same time, Dobbs should assure Amir in writing that, subject of course to any general conventions, his own personal and State imports, whether of arms or otherwise, will ordinarily be allowed up free during the currency of the treaty, and that &apos;we will lend cur good offices with the League of Nations should he desire them to secure Afghan admission to League and -Afghan signature to any Arms Convention, in-order to remove difficulties in the way of arms imports. Tightening up of our demands under the pis alter might take the form of insertion in the subsidy clause of the words &quot;more especially.as regards the (? maintenance of peace) on the North-West Frontier of India &quot; between words &quot; foregoing articles &quot; and &quot; agree to pay.&quot; We regard this as important in order to reconcile certain sections of political India to the payment of the subsidy. On the other hand, we are in no real need of consulates at both Kandahar and Jalalabad and Dobbs might meet Amir&apos;s wishes by striking out one or the other, preferably latter, in view of our long connection with the former.Clause 15 can hardly be entered into in its present form in view oi our knowledge of Afghan treaty with Russia and of statement in the British Govern-menfs last note to the Soviet Government.   We have to devise a formula which will put Afghanistan under obligation to obtain revision of the Russian treaty, where it conflicts with the terms oi our own.   Of course Afghanistan cannot compel Russia to-revise the treaty in accordance  with this understanding, but it vtould have the-advantage of putting us right with the public.   In the peculiar circumstances, what seems required is a statement, first, that no treaty, agreement or understanding with a third party directed against the interests of the other contracting party will be entered into during the currency of the treaty, and secondly, that each party under-takes to obtain revision of the terms of any such treaty, agreement or understanding, if any, that may have previously been entered into, which is in conflict or inconsistent with the terms of the present treaty.    If his Majesty&apos;s Government agree with this proposal, we should be grateful for any suggestions they may make as to formula.. W^e should be glad of. very early orders.
From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, &apos; 30th September 1921.(Received 1st October., 8 a.m.)Clear the line.First of two Parts.2296 S. Dobbs&apos; 307 C, second and third parts. Public treaty which Amir now professes to put forward as jm exclusive treaty is not exclusive at all. Except for partial and inevitable irreconcilability of Consulate clause, it would contain nothing that would be incompatible with terms of Soviet treaty, or would render co-existence of two treaties impossible. Proposed re-draft of last sentences of clause 15 is platitudinous, for it is inconceivable that Amir would give either Russia or us or any other nation exclusive rights in her public services or commercial exploitation. In essence, therefore, treaty Amir proposes is nothing but our old treaty of friendship on terms far exceeding those we were prepared to offer for genuine exclusive treaty.Part one ends.   .From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 1st October 1921.(Received 12 noon.) .Clear the line.2296 S. Second and last part. Were we to accept his proposal, Ave should have &quot; nothing but his word as a guarantee that he would carry out the undertakings to break with Russia, wmich he proposes to give us secretly. He would rely on our inability to repudiate treaty because we could point to nothing in it which he would infringe, and because we would be unable, to take our stand on his non-fulfilment of secret clauses, as he.- knows we are not at liberty to enter into any such. Moreover, even if we were prepared to accept those secret clauses as binding they would not give us that clean cut we have been aiming at. Pith of the matter, as it appears to us, is this : Amir has been taken aback by our presentation of gentlemanly treaty. This is the minimum that has ever been put forward in negotiations. In order to strike an even balance he has now come forward with his maximum, after the ordinary Oriental method of bargaining. We think still that the tactics proposed in our telegram of the 30th September, 2290 S., are the ones Dobbs should adopt. End of last part. .From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 2nd October 1921.(Received 5 p.m.)Clear the line.2308 S.   Following from Dobbs, 308 C, dated 28th September .-&quot; Following is situation as I see (? it omitted). With the departure of Jamah chief support of Tarsi, faction of Nadir Khan have become predominant and temporarily persuaded Amir that Tarsi has backed the wn-ong horse. They have been helped by friction wri&apos;th Russians in Ferghana and elsewhere, and Ghulam Sideck&apos;s reports of Russian chaos. But they cannot reverse Tarsi policy unless they can show conspicuous gain from contrary policy. Hence Amir&apos;s obstinacy in despising gentlemanly and pis alter treaties Avhich he now regards as unattractive remnant of Tarsi policy. If he cannot secure brilliant success by pro-British attitude on exclusive lines he will revert more rapidly than before to pro-Russian attitude. At all costs Nadir Khan party wish to discredit Tarsi plan of equal advantages from both sides, and to put all their money on one side or the other. Amir is acting as his own Foreign Minister and has particularly requested me not to let any news of his discussions with me get to Tarsi&apos;s ears, and if I have occasion to write, to address letter to Foreign -Minister but to see that it is delivered to Amir. Further, foreign policy has become plaything of Kabul factions regardless of Afghan interests. It is difficult to believe that if we accepted Amir&apos;s proposals he would not gravely (? greatly) lose credit with his people through volte face. He would probably be suspected of taking bribes. On the other hand, he could hardly betray us as he wishes to betray Russians, because latter would never trust him again and would be so angry that his advances would be repulsed. I believe, therefore, that Amir would be forced by circumstances to keep faith with us for considerable time, and that we could trust him 4700 B
to denounce treaty with Russia after the interval, which he requires. But I doubt whether so impulsive and unstable a character can long hold its own in Afghanistan, and I remain of opinion that our safest and most dignified course is to insist on neighbourly treaty as it stands or nothing, and to face consequence of its almost inevitable rejection.&quot;It seems a little doubtful whether Ainir is really excluding Tarsi. His personal intervention may.quite possibly have -been pre-arranged between them.: From Viceroy; Foreign and Political Department,&quot; ; 3rd October 11)21. .-.      . .&quot; . . (Received. 4th, 8a.m.)Clear the line. . -2813 S. &apos; Following from Dobbs, 313 0.,. dated 1st October :-&quot; Your telegrams of 30th September, 2291 and 2297. I have exceedingly little hope of success of suggested programme because  &quot; (1) Amir and all parties are agreed against official disclosure of Russian secret clauses, which, with strange inconsistency,&apos;they consider more dishonourable than repudiation of whole treaty. . .     .&quot; (2) Amir now fanatically insists on elimination of India Office.from -all Afghan diplomatic relations in London on ground of independence. &apos; .   &apos;&quot;(3) Undertaking to. get. treaty, v^ith Russia amended in our favour seems tantamount to partial denunciation of treaty in return for which Amir requires much larger advantages than suggested.. I. understand that points on which amendments w/oukl be: required are not only prohibition. of Eastern Consulates, which would be separately secured by clause 6 of pis oilier, but, refusal of Russian subsidy and.arms, since latest note to Soviet (? Government) of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to which Government of India refer, takes greatest exception to these. Afghans would certainly refuse to sign undertaking to amend without points on which amendment is required being specified.&quot;2. In chaotic condition to which Aniir&apos;s impulses have reduced negotiations, I now recommend following course. . Tarsi and I should exchange notes setting forth, our regret that, in spite of all our efforts, confused condition of world has prevented our arriving at basis of a treaty of friendship. Neither State, however, desires to close the door on negotiations finally, and we have therefore arranged for an immediate exchange of Ministers in the hope that it will be found possible in the near future, through their instrumentality, to devise definite friendly terms in a more favourable atmosphere either in London or -Kabul. In my letter&apos; 1 would undertake that relations of Afghan Minister at London;shall, for so long as Afghan Government behaved itself, be with Foreign Office only, and would promise in a separate confidential letter, until final treaty is settled, free provision in London of suitable Legation, free motor for envoy, free passage of envoy and his suite to London, and free passage for one courier each way every two months, with free telegraph facilities already suggested. Cost would not exceed one lakh of rupees per annum, but would be, I think, attractive to the Afghans as in accordance with their views often expressed to me.&quot; 3. I fear that the suggestion to give way to the Amir over relations with Foreign Office may be strongly condemned. But I see no prospect of bringing the Amir to reasonable frame of mind unless we remove this ground for his suspicions of our desire not to recognise his independence (? fully). Iu practice it seems almost certain that Amir would never fully trust his envoy in London, and would merely use him as a sign of independence, and as intelligence officer. Every matter of importance would therefore be discussed between Amir and British Minister at Kabul, and the latter.would, of course, receive his orders from the Viceroy and Secretary of State. Correspondence between Viceroy and Amir would of course continue, and be provided for in my letter. If we could avoid open rupture at the cost of this concession, and of temporary expenditure of one lakh of rupees per annum in facilities to Afghan Legation, it would see in well worth while. Negotiations could then be resumed on a favourable opportunity by Pears here, who would meanwhile deal with current affairs as ordinary/Minister. This proposal would perhaps have better chance of success than any other:. It could be accompanied by assurances that we have no intention of stopping exportation of arms to Afghanistan unless compelled to do so by
&quot;hostile attitude on the part of Afghanistan, till ratification of Arms Convention, in. which latter event easy solution would be ratification of same Convention by Afghanistan.&quot; 4. I trust that, if Government of India consider this suggestion feasible, it may be forwarded to Secretary of State immediately without awaiting his orders op, telegrams already sent, since I see no prospect of getting through proposals contained therein. I would, however, (? be willing to) put them forward first, if desired, and only take action (? which I) now recommend in the event of Amir&apos;s definite refusal. I fear, however, that to put forward proposals which it is in more ways than one certain that Amir would reject, would only embitter negotiations and make him. inclined to refuse even innocuous suggestion Avhich I now make.&quot;Merit of Dobbs&apos; suggestion is that it would avoid a formal rupture. But the frontier would not appreciate difference, and Afghan popularity, now at a low ebb, would be revived under Afghan propaganda that our large offer(s) had been (? refused omitted) for the sake of tribes and Turkey. Verdict of public would be tha^ Dobbs had come away empty-handed after nine months of negotiations while Amir carried off one of the main points for which he has been striving. For what Amir essentially wants from us is (1) practical demonstration of our unreserved recognition of Afghanistan^ complete independence and (2) material advantage(s). We should be giving aAvay the whole of (? 1) and something not inconsiderable under (2), viz., the expense(s) of London Legation, of which one lakh of rupees is clearly an under-estimate, and the restoration of right to import arms suspended under the Pindi treaty. I cannot but feel that this Avould place us in a false position of over-anxiety for the subsequent treaty after having parted gratis with much of our bargaining powers. Having squeezed us so far, Avithout giving anything in return, Amir might then . keep tribes sufficiently astir, until he thought the time had corAe to emphasise increasing value of his goodwill on the frontier. Part two follows.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 4th October 1921.(Received 5 p.m.)Clear the line.Second and last Part.2313 S. Meanwhile, Arnawai difficulty Avould be left in the air. Reluctant though I am. to differ from the man on the spot, I still think that, as (? exclusive) treaty is out of the question, our best tactics would be to present old treaty of friend-ship with the subsidy. On the other hand, I am impressed with Avhat Dobbs says regarding clause 3 and.the Amirs fanatical insistence on the elimination of the India Office from Afghanistan&apos;s diplomatic relations in London. Do you attach (? so omitted) much importance to its inclusion in clause 3, as to rule its elimination out and risk failure to make treaty ? Having recognised Afghanistan&apos;s independence, it is not difficult for us to understand Afghanistan&apos;s claim tot ordinary diplomatic access to Foreign Office, hoAvever inconvenient this may be to us. But is this inconvenience likely to be considerable ? Would not the result be much the same whichever channel of access is adopted ? For, if to the Foreign Office, would not matters relating to Afghanistan have also to pass through India Office ? My object in recom-mending inclusion of undertaking to obtain revision of (? Russo-Afghan) treaty was primarily to.put ourselves right with the public,.and, secondly, to encourage Afghans to proceed with their endeavours to get Consulate clause in Russian treaty formally rectified. I no longer regard elimination of subsidy and arms from Russian treaty as within practical politics, but Russia may before long make default. We are in the awkward position of demanding public disclosure of clauses of which we already have some knowledge, and. which the Afghans profess themselves unable to divulge without grave provocation to Russia. Are His Majesty&apos;s Government still adamant on this point ?
