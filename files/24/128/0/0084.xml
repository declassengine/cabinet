-this-Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1921.SECEET. - -CP. 3385.BOYCOTT PLACED BY SINN FEIN &apos; ON CERTAIN CLASSES of imported BRITISH GOODS.Memorandum by Chief Secretary for Ireland.AT a meeting of Dail Eireann held in March 1921, it was decided to extend the boycott, previously only exercised against Belfast goods, to certain classes of British-made goods. The enforcement of the decision of the Dail was entrusted to the Trade Department presided over by Earnan de Blaghd (Ernest Blythe) styling himslf &quot; Minister of Trade.&quot;The first &quot;order,&quot; which became operative on the 31st March, was made on the 23rd March, 1921, and prohibited the importation of certain types of British-made agricultural machinery. Four subsequent orders, of which I attach a precis/ (Appendix A), were made between March and June 1921 ; the last.one referring to certain proprietary articles became operative on the 1st September, 1921, during which month it has been posted freely in Dublin. The latter orders differed from the order of the 23rd March only inasmuch as they prohibited sale as well as importation.The Propaganda Department of Dail Eareann hailed the advent of these orders as a genuine attempt to revive and encourage home (e.g., Irish) industries, but, as will be seen from the attached copy of the first order (Appendix B), importation of the named articles from America and the Continent was not forbidden. In fact the Sinn Fein emissaries abroad were instructed to point out to manufacturers in their respective countries the golden opportunities thus presented to capture what had been before practically an English monopoly.The following is an extract from the letter of one of the largest agricultural implement manufacturers in this country-Messrs. Ruston and Hornsby (Lincoln): &quot; We realise, only too well, that if our imports are kept out and those of America and Germany allowed to go in we shall have extreme difficulty in subsequently regaining the trade. This is a case where, as business people, we feel most strongly that the British Government can and must help us by preventing the^ee import of such goods, when ours are rigidly excluded.&quot;It is not believed that these &quot; orders &quot; issued by Dail Eireann would be observed by traders to any marked degree, or that they could be enforced, but it soon became apparent that Irish traders who failed to observe these decrees were threatened, and, if they persisted, their persons or their property were attacked by the I.R.A. Further, flying columns of the IR.A. would swoop down from the mountains and destroy consignments of goods in transit from England to Irish traders, with the result that trade in the proclaimed articles between England and Ireland has now practically ceased.This interference with trade was not specifically referred to in the terms of the truce agreed to between the Commander-in-chief in Ireland and Mr. de Valera in. July, and Sinn Fein, taking advantage of the truce, are continuing to do all in their power to boycott trade from Northern and Southern Ireland and from Great Britain to Ireland.This question, as will be seen from the following extract of a statement made by the general manager of the Agricultural and General Engineers (Limited) in the &quot; Daily Mail &quot; of the 7th instant, has a material bearing on the unemployment problem, and I would urge that this question be taken up at the conference with the Sinn Fein [7068]
delegates to be held next week in London, and the strongest representations made to have the embargo removed : &quot; As makers of agricultural machinery, our chief stumbling-block in the home , trade at present is the Irish situation. Ireland is our best home market. This trade, which means so much to our employees in wages, has been killed by the so-called Irish Republican trade ban. Few people in this country have realised that this is a serious &apos; stopper&apos; on trade. The agents won&apos;t stock; the farmers won&apos;t buy. Why ? Because they know if they do there will be trouble for them, and people in Ireland just now are not anxious to make their position more difficult than it is.&quot; The first business of the Prime Minister when the peace negotiations with the Sinn Fein delegates begin will be, I hope, to secure the removal of this ban in the interests of all British manufacturers, and it will help the unemployment question greatly in the manufacturing centres.&quot;H.
