Memorandum by Llout.-Gommnndor Hon.J*M.Konworthy, M.P* ( Circulated for information).UTjpor Siioeia was visitou D,y tno writor durihfe tnow*ok ending 17th SoptomDor, 19El.I wont in quite incognito through the good offices of the British Intelligence Officers, who gave me every assistance,   I visited the whole of the Industrial Triangle, the Kreie of Rybnik, the agricultural areas to the Forth and to the East, including Lublinitz.It is impossible for anyeno who has not been into the Industrial Triangle and l^he areas reund the towns of *euthen, Konigshutter Kattcwits and Gleiwltz to understand the complexity of the is&amp;u&amp;trial organisation that, has **en built up*   I myself come from the T7est Rising of V*rksbire and I know the industrial and mining areas of North England Well, but I have never seen anything approaching the highly delicate structure in the/ \Industrial Triangle.   Practically^the whole of the directors, managers, foremen and skilled workers in this ajrea.are Germans, and the idea of 1fce Poles taking itover-and working it is simply ridiculous.     You have onlyfto go over the Polish border out of the Industrial Triangle, as I did, to see the absurdity of Polarid having any part of this area.    You pass from organisation, efficioncy, industry, wealth in German Silesia jihte squalor, dirt, indolenoe and superstition in Polish Silesia,   I make bold to say that every British officer and British official   stationed In Upper Silesia is convinced that the bending over of the Industrial Triangle to Poland would mean the ruin of the province and would be an eoomomio crime of ihe first magnitude.      Even the French admit this quite openly, and some of the more conscience-stricken regret the trend of French policy.     But the French openly say that it is because
the alienation of this province from Germany would he such a blow for German industry that they wish for that Tory reason to accomplish it.With regard to the argument that it is simply a question of capital versus labour;   capital and the land-owners being German, and the workers being Poids.   This is all nonsdnse.   I interviewed the workers1 leaders.     These were Franz, majority Socialist, leader of -the Miners Federation and member of the Prussian landtag;   Griese, of the Metal Workers Union, leader of the liberal Trade Unions;   Stanch, leader of the so-called Christian Socialists and of the Miners Organisation;   and Kovfoll, secretary of the Federation of Trade Unions of Upper Silesia and a majority Socialist.     There are in the province 800,000 organised German Trade Unionists and to this may be added 25,000 foremen and technical exports whe are also organised and affiliated to them.     There are among these 35,000 Communists and Syndicalists who are orientated to Germany.     Generally spealaing, the majority of the metal workers are pure Germans, the majority of the miners are Poles.     But these Polish miners, although they spoak the Wasser-Polish dialect, also speak Gorman and they oan only read German.The number of Polish Trade Unionists is stated to he 225,000, hut these figures are greatly exaggerated and are &quot;believed to he forged.     It is stated that thousands of German workmen have been forced to join the Polish Trade Unions through terrorisation.      While on this question of labour, it is worth noting that the whole of the workers in Upper Silesia, Polish-speaking Or Gorman-speaking, are he coming very alarmed at the prospect
of being transferred from Germany, with its well-developed Industrial lnsuranoe and advanced 1 ah our lcfcialation, to Poland where labour legislation is in its infancy ana where tho Government is actively hostilo to Trade Unions.     In fact, there are responsible German Trade Unionists who prophecy a extreme-a&amp;cus impetus to tho Comaunist movement in Upper Silesie heoause of this very matter, should the industrial area or a substantial part of tho province ho transferred to Poland.Now with regard to the argument that it is necessary to transfer Upper Silesia to Poland for economic reasons9 &quot;two-fifths of tho Silesian eoal-field is now in the possossion of Poland and has been for generations.   There is no reason at all why tho Polish land-owners could not have developed the ooal under thoir estates in tho same way &apos;as German land-owners like Prince Henkol ven Dennersraark and tho Duke of Battibpr havo done,     further-more, there is in tho part of Silesia which was Austrian and which is now transferred to Poland, a number of iron found&quot;riea and metal works which were flourishing oonoerns, paying good dividends, up to the time of the transfer from Austria to Poland;   the Poles,have not been able to start these works suocessf ally^ although they have made attempts, and they show little signs of being able to do so.71th regard to the suggestion to transfer Pless and Rybnik from Germany to Poland,     This will be nearly as serious as transferring the Industrial Triangle itself. The peasants in Pless&apos;and Rynbik send their sons to work in the mines and metal works;   they 2-snd their agricultural produce to feed the towns in the InCust-rlal Triangle.
They axe horrified at the idea of being out off from the rest of the province.,   Further, tho unasrploitod ooal resources of the province lie in.those two Kroisen:   the ooal seams further north are getting worked out.     The future prosperity of the province depends on being ablo to ozploit these unworked seams to the South,   These two districts depend for their electrical supply and their water on the Industrial Triangle,   The water problem Is very serious in Upper Silesia and the sources of supply aro few.Now with regard to Lublinitz,     Here the same reasons apply with regard to the families of the peasants working in the mines and metal works, but this district also supplies the majority of the pit&apos;props for the pits in the. south.A remarkable change of opinion has taken place in Upper Silesia since the last plebiscite and especially sinoo the Korfanty insurrection.     The majority of the inhabitants quite briefly are against partition.    There is a majority in favour of the whole province going to Germany.   There is a   minority in favour of the whole province going to Poland;     but the number of Upper Silesians who would not bitterly oppose partition is negligible.   Further, thoy learnt some bitter lesson3 during tho insurrection.     For one thing, the province was flooded with Congress Polos, friends of Korfanty, who ware foisted into all the posts and jobs to the detriment of the local Poles,   A^ain, Korfanty promised land, cattle and money to the men who took up arms, and these
promise hare not been kept at all.   Again, there was much looting and the Congress Poles desired to take this loot Into Poland, to the great disgust of the Sileslan Poles who said it must stop in the province,     They actually oame to blows ever this and there was bloodshed.To sum up,    If m partition Upper Silesia we eommit a crime against the economic prosperity of Europe.   And we do it with our eyes open,   Ue have seen the results of similar partitionlngs in other parts of Europe, and ws should be xmrned by that.    But this ease will be far werso.   If we are intent on ruining Germany at all costs partition Upper Silesia, but we should be committing an*outrage on the 7,000,000 inhabitant who after all are comparatively blameless for the war and its events.    It 1b said Upper Silesia Is full of munition factories t-ailltary nations do not establish munition faotories near the frontiers.    But Upper Silesia is a storehouse of wealth for all Europe, and Surope is too poor to be able to Afford to destroy it,feigned), JOHN CTT70RTHY.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.w.l. 28th September, 1921,
