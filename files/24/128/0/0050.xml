This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1921.CONFIDENTIAL.SHOULD A DOCTOR TELL?DAWSON OF PENN has placed upon the Order Paper of the House of Lords a motion intended to raise the question of a doctor&apos;s obligation to disclose or to keep secret what he has learnt in his professional capacity, when called upon to answer in a Court of Law. The motion has been withdrawn temporarily, but I understand! that Lord Dawson will renew it on the first opportunity; and that he will, when the motion comes on, contend that the Courts and the judges should be forbidden by law to require disclosure by the doctor, alike in criminal and in civil causes.I have for some time meditated the composition of a magazine article upon this subject. I have now put together the material which I had collected for this purpose in such a form as may, I hope, assist the Cabinet in the discussion of an issue which is. of great public importance and which excites considerable public interest.i No apology is necessary for raising the question which has been asked by Lord Dawson of Penn. Issues are involved in,it which are of.the gravest consequence. They deserve the most ample consideration and they must&apos;foe looked at broadly not as affecting one class or profession or another, but as concerning the whole machinery for the detection and prevention of crime and the administration of justice, and therefore as of the most vital consequence to the community.In the first place, I would like to clear away, if I can, certain misapprehensions and preconceptions which cloud the discussion of the true issue. The matter is put forward sometimes as a claim for what is called medical privilege some peculiar right or private advantage to be given to members of the medical profession upon the - suggested analogy of some right or privilege possessed by both branches of the legal profession. On that, I would say three things. First, the so-called privilege attach-ing to the relation of a legal adviser or an advocate is a privilege which is the clients privilege, conferred, not for the benefit of the legal person involved, but for the general advantage of the community, upon the ground that, unless a relation of absolute confidence can be established.between the lay client and his professional adviser, in practice the ends of justice cannot be attained. It is worth recollecting that the privilege is denied to the client who consults a lawyer in relation to the furtherance of some criminal enterprise, for in such a case the public interest in detection and punishment of crime demands the fullest disclosure of any such confidence. (See most informative judgment in R. v. Cox and Railton. 15 Cox. Cr. Cases 611.)Many years ago one&apos; of my predecessors stated the doctrine in words which have received confirmation both from time and from the opinion of successive judges. &quot; The foundation of the privilege,&quot; said Lord Brougham, &quot; is not on account of. any particular importance which the law attaches to the business of the legal profession or any particular desire to afford them protection. But it is out of regard to the interests of justice which cannot be upholden and to the administration of justice which cannot go on, without the aid of men skilled in jurisprudence, in the practice of the Courts and in those matters affecting the rights and obligations which form the subject of all judicial proceedings.&quot; (Per Lord Brougham. Greenough ?; Gaskell 1 My. K. 102, 103.)Second, that privilege only concerns communications which arise in connection with legal proceedings whether actual or contemplated, or which pass as professional communications in a professional capacity. (See per Lord Selborne, L.C., in Minet v. Morgan.   L.R. 8 Ch, App. at p. 368.)And thirdly, it should be observed that though it attaches in some degree to persons who, not being barristers or solicitors, in fact advise lay clients in litigious matters such persons, for example, as expert witnesses it is for the most part in its actual operation confined to persons who stand in a peculiar relation to the courts of justice. The solicitor is an officer of the court. Discipline over him, if he abuses his rights or does not discharge his duties properly, rests primarily with his own professional body, all the members of which are also officers of the court; but [6815] B      .&apos;!
ultimately rests with the court itself. The discipline of the Bar is in the hands of the Inns of Court; ultimately, again, upon appeal from any Inn, it rests with the judges of England acting collectively.And the privilege, being created for, and operating in, the administration of justice, is always under the vigilant eye of His M!ajesty&apos;s judges, themselves trained in the exercise of their profession, but performing their functions as judges, noffor , the benefit or protection of the Bar or the members of the solicitors profession, but for the advantage of the litigant and the community at large.Between this so-called privilege and the claims put forward by, or on behalf of, the medical profession, there is scarcely any analogy. I, therefore, do not pause to describe more exactly the nature or the extent of what is somewhat loosely termed the privilege of the Bar and the solicitor. I would rather invite those who talk and think and write about the matter to consider it upon its merits, having regard to the public good, without reference to the fact (which really has very little to do with it) that for another purpose persons differently situated are placed under peculiar liabilities with regard to secrecy.There is another,professional calling which must naturally occur to men&apos;s minds when any allegation of a confidential relation above the law comes into question. It is said that the priest is under an obligation, heavier than any which men can impose, to keep hidden that which has been disclosed to him in confession. It would be unprofitable here to discuss the rule which prevails on this matter in the Roman communion. When this point has arisen in the English Courts, it has been dealt with rather as a matter of discretion in the judge than as a rule of law, though since the case of Rex v. Gilham (1 Moo. C.C. 186) it appears to be settled law that a privilege does not attach to a communication made to a clergyman by way of confession.* (See per Best C.J. 3 C. and P. at p. 519, and per Alderson B. Cox&apos;s Cr. Cases 6219.)The most explicit statement of the law is to be found in an answer given by the Lord Chancellor (Lord Westbury).in the House of Lords on the 12th May, 1865. (Hansard 3rd Series.  Vol. 179 at p. 180.)   It was as follows : -&quot;There can be no doubt that in a suit or criminal proceeding a clergyman of the Church of England is not privileged so as to decline to answer a question which is put to him for the purposes of justice, on the ground that his answer would reveal something that has been made known to him in confession. A witness is compelled to answer every such question, and the law of England does not extend the privilege of refusing to answer to Roman Catholic clergy-men who have obtained the information in confession from a person of their own religious persuasion.&quot;The doctrine thus stated was expressly accepted by Lord Chelmsford (ex-Lord Chancellor) upon the same occasion.* See note to Taylor on Evidence, 10th edition, vol. 1, p. 647 : &quot;In considering this case (i.e., Gilham&apos;s case) and other common law decisions upon the subject of evidence, it must be recollected that the common law knew of no distinction between competent and com-pellable such a distinction being entirely the creation of modern statute law. When, therefore, the judges decided (as in 1828, after argument, they all unanimously did in R. v. Gilham, 1 Moo. CO. 186, absente Hullock, B.) that a clergyman was competent to give evidence of a confession made to him, they in effect also decided that he was compeUable to do so. It has been argued with much ability in &apos; Best on Evidence,&apos; 8th edit., 1893, SS 854, 855; Phillimo&apos;e&apos;s &apos; Ecclesiastical Law,&apos; edit. 1873, pp. 701 et seq.; and in &apos;The Privilege of Religious Confessions in English Courts of Justice,&apos; by Edward Kadelev, M.A. a convert from Protestantism to the Roman Catholic Church which was published in London by Butterworths in 1865, that confessions to clergymen of the Established Church are privileged, on the ground that the articuli cleri (9 Edw. 2, c. 10). although for centuries treated as obsolete, and at last actually repealed by &apos; The Statute Law Revision Act, 1863&apos; (26 &amp; 27 V., c. 125), were long the law of the land, and that the opinion (given after the Reformation) expressed in Sir Edward Coke&apos;s comment on this statute (2 Inst. 629) may be so read as to imply that such privilege extended to everything but high treason. This view, however, cannot be accepted as being at present the law in the teeth of the decision m R. v. Gilham; of the dicta of the eminent judges mentioned in note 4 to S 917, in which they tacitly or expressly accept the position that strict law does not admit the privilege, although they protest that they individually will never enforce the strict letter of the law; and of the weight of opinion amongst the writers of text-books on the law of evidence. The present editor has, under these circumstances, advised magistrates that, as they are bound by their oaths to dispense justice to all who seek it of them, without fear, favour or affection, and as they are also bound to accept without quesiion the law as laid down by the superior courts, they have no alter-native but to enforce an answer from a clergyman on a matter relevant to the case before them, and ought not to execuse him on the ground that it is privileged by having been made in confession, and this although they can only punish a witness who refuses to answer by committing him for contempt, and not by merely imposing a fine: Thw Queen v. Flavell. 1884, 14 Q.B.D. 364. The same considerations ought to govern the actions of other inferior courts. It will be noticed that all that the late Sir R. Phillimore ventured to commit himself to was an expression of opinion (Phill. &apos; Eccl. Law,&apos; 704) that it is &apos; at least not improbable &apos; that the privilege of clergymen of the Church of England as to matters told them in confessions will be recognised when the question next comes before a superior court.&quot;
It is curious that the canon of 1322 ordains that&apos;&apos; no priest through anger, hate, or even fear of death shall dare to disclose in any manner the confession of anyone by sign, by nodj or by word generally or specially.&quot; But the canon of 1603 provides that &quot; if any man confess his secret and hidden sins to the minister for the unburthening of his conscience and to receive spiritual consolation and ease of mind of him, we do not in any way bind the said minister by this our constitution, but do straitly charge and admonish him, that he do not at any time reveal and make known to any person whatsoever any crime or offence, so committed to his trust and secrecy [except they be such crimes as by the laws of this realm his own life may be called into question for concealing the same) under pain of irregularity.&quot;It is perhaps unnecessary to labour the distinction between the position of the doctor and that of the priest, but it is worth while to observe, on the one hand, that the doctrine of the sanctity of the confessional has in the past shaken the stability alike of States and of ecclesiastical systems, and, on the other, that the mysteries confided to the priest are laid before him as definite statements in the course of a sacred and solemn rite as the outpourings of a tortured soul and in the belief that by that means alone can the penitent obtain relief from suffering greater than the law can impose, while the secrets possessed by the doctor are far more usually the fruit of his own skilled observation of the pathological history as it discloses itself before him.Turning-now to the question as it affects doctors, I must first observe that every-one will agree in the broad proposition that the relations between a doctor and his patient should be confidential. The only question which arises is as to the limits which should be set tothis relation of confidence. In normal circumstances, common sense and the ordinary feelings of honour would prevent a doctor from gossiping about his patienfs ailments or symptoms or medical history, and, apart from any question of legal proceedings, the facts must indeed be exceptional which would justify a doctor in divulging that which he knows by reason only of his professional relation. Some may say hastily that if legal proceedings are excluded from considera-tion the obligation of confidence is absolute. It does not lie upon me to make.any definite pronouncement on the subject. No such dictum could be binding, but I will suggest at least one instance where, though no question of any duty before the law complicates the situation, a doctor taking this extreme view may be placed in grave doubt as to his course of action. Take the common case of the general practitioner who has become, through long use and habit, the friend of the household, who has perhaps some twenty years ago brought into the world the daughter who is the hope of the family Suppose that he is in like relation to another household also, in which a boy of slightly greater age has been his patient for many years. Suppose that in the relation of doctor and patient he becomes aware that the boy is suffering from syphilis and has reached a stage at which his ultimate cure is at least doubtful, while as family friend, the doctor learns that the boy and girl are engaged to be married. What course is he to take ?It does not rest with me to answer this question. I only propose it for the purpose of suggesting that the whole domain is one where no absolute and inflexible rule can be laid down, where there may easily arise obligations of a conflicting nature, and where the ultimate decision must be taken, in accordance with the high ethical sense of a learned and honourable profession, whose aim is to raise or at least to maintain the standard of physical health in the community.It is right to point out in this connection that with this very object, that is, the improvement of health in the country, recent statutes have imposed directly upon medical men duties which are inconsistent with any theory of inviolable confidence. The Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, requires every medical practitioner in attendance upon a patient suffering from an infectious disease to which the Act applies, on becoming aware that the patient is so suffering, immediately to give notice to the medical officer of health for the district by sending to him a certificate stating the name of the patient, the situation of the building, and the. name of the infectious disease. The infectious diseases to wmich the Act applies are small-pox, cholera, diphtheria, membraneous croup, erysipelas, scarlatina or scarlet fever, typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing, continued or puerperal fevers.A still more recent Act The Notification of Births Act, 1909-requires any person in attendance upon a woman who has given birth to a child within six hours of the birth to give notice in writing of the birth to the medical officer of health.Failure to comply with the provisions of either of these Acts involves the doctor in a penalty, but his zeal in respect of his duties under the Infectious Disease Act is.&apos; [6815] B 2
stimulated by his right to receive from the local authority a fee of 2s. M. for every case which he notifies. The policy of the legislature in respect of this matter may be gauged by the fact that the Notification of Births Act, 1909, originally applied only in the areas of those local authorities who adopted it, but by an amending Act of 1915 it has been made universal thoughout the country.These two Acts came into existence under the fostering care of the Local Govern-ment Board the predecessor in title of the Ministry of Health. The aim of those who framed and passed, them was to check the spread of disease and to improve the public health by affording greater facilities for the care of infant children. They represent the best informed opinion among those medical practitioners whose interest lies in the promotion of the public health. I cite them for the purpose of showing that where a great public interest is involved, public opinion and the best informed opinion among doctors is not prepared to tolerate any claim to inviolate secrecy. They are of course patently inconsistent with the whole principle upon which the present agitation rests.I turn now to consider the field of investigation which lies more immediately before us, where the feelings of the profession and the rule of law may come into conflict. It would be an easier task to reach a definite conclusion here if it were possible to know what exactly is the claim put forward by the spokesmen, of the profession, how far that claim is supported unanimously by the great mass of practitioners, whether it is confined to civil matters or relates also to crime, whether it is asserted only where the confidential relation of doctor and patient has been established, whether it is intended to protect the patient or to further some particular class of ameliorative treatment, or is directed merely or partly to protect the practitioner himself.The answers to these questions cannot be found in the discussions of the professional bodies representing the medical profession. The arguments used in those discussions and the claims put forward are discordant and loose, and they do not accord with the practice, which is in itself divergent.Yet it may clarify the consideration of the subject if, in the first place, I set out in the form of an interrogatory the questions which arise and to which distinct answers may be required from the advocates of the claim for professional medical privilege.   They are-: 1. Is the claim, limited to (a.) Civil cases only, or(6.) Criminal cases only, or(c.) Does it extend to both classes of cases 12. Does the claim extend to matters which are the result of the doctor&apos;s observa-tion in the course of his treatment, or is it limited to direct communica-tions made orally or in writing to him by his patient ?3. As regards crime, is it claimed that (a.) Where a doctor has knowledge gained in his professional capacity i that a crime is being, or is about to be, committed he is not toinform the police ? (b.) Where a doctor has knowledge gained in his professional capacitythat a crime has been committed, he is not to inform the police ?4. Where a crime has been committed and the doctor has knowledge gained in his professional capacity which would assist in convicting the criminal or clearing an innocent man (whether his client or not), is it claimed that the doctor is to refuse information to the police when called upon to &apos; give it ?5. Where a crime has been committed and a person has been put upon his trial, and the doctor has knowledge, gained in his professional capacity, which is material to the point at issue, and is called upon on his subpoena to answer questions on matters which he knows in his professional capacity, is it claimed that he is to refuse to answer them ?6. In any of these cases, is the obligation of silence to be absolute or is it to i....; . depend upon the circumstances of the case, and, if the latter, is the doctor to judge whether he is to reply or not ?7. Is the obligation of confidence to be violated if the patient wishes it to be ?8. Is the obligation absolute where the person put upon his trial is not the patient of the doctor and the evidence relates to another person who is, in fact, the doctor&apos;s patient?
* Taylor&apos;s &quot; Principles and Pructice of Medical Jurisprudence,&quot; 6th edition, 1910.9. Towauds whom does the obligation exist? &quot;Where the patient is a husband or wife, does it subsist in respect of the other spouse ? Where the patient is a child, does it subsist towards the child or the child&apos;s parents, and which, or both, of them ? Where the patient is dead, does it still subsist, and if it still subsists towards the. surviving relatives, is it releasable by them ? Does it subsist in relation to a lunatic who is a patient, and, if so, can itxbe released by the lunatic&apos;s relatives or committee?10. In civil cases, where the relation of doctor and patient exists between the plaintiff and the doctor, and knowledge obtained by the doctor is necessary or relevant to defeat the plaintiffs claim, and the doctor is subpoenaed to give that evidence on behalf of the defendant, does the obligation exist so as to forbid him to give that evidence ?11. And where the relation exists between the defendant and the doctor, and the doctor is subpoenaed by the plaintiff in order to establish his case, is the doctor then bound to be silent ?12. In particular, in divorce cases, is the doctor, whose knowledge is necessary to establish the commission of a matrimonial offence by either party, to refuse to answer when called by the opposite party, and, if so, does the obligation still hold good where the evidence of the doctor would be material to establish the innocence of the party against whom the charge is made by reason of the doctor&apos;s knowledge of the pathological condition of the accusing party or otherwise ?13. In cases where an action is brought by a patient against a medical man between whom and the patient the relation of patient and doctor has been established, and in respect of matters arising out of that relation, is the defendant bound to silence? Where the relation of doctor and patient subsists between the plaintiff and several medical men simultaneously, and an action is brought by a patient against one of those medical men, are the other medical men bound to silence when called either by the plaintiff or by the defendant ? 114. Where the doctor acts merely as a laboratory pathologist, is the obligation the same as where he acts directly in treatment of disease ? For example, what is the rule to be where the doctor has merely examined specimens taken from the patients body or clothes? And is the obligation  whatever it be the same whether the specimens have been submitted at the instance of the patient himself or at the instance of some third party, such as the police, or the opposite party in&quot; a civil action ?15. What is to be the rule, whether in civil or criminal cases, where the doctor is simultaneously in a position of confidence to two parties, for example, \ husband and wife, or father and child, and questions arise, whether in a criminal or civil case, between those parties with respect to which his evidence is material ? For example, what is his. duty in a case of disputed parentage? In a case of nullity? Or in the case of a charge under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, or under the Prevention of Incest Act ?At the outset of the inquiry it is right first to state the law. Whatever doubt may exist about the privilege of the confessional, none can exist in law about the doctots claim to privilege. Since the Duchess of Kingston&apos;s case (1776, 20 State Trials, p. 355 and p. 573) it has never seriously been questioned that the law is as it was then stated to be by Lord Mansfield. &quot; If a surgeon was voluntarily to reveal these secrets,to be sure he would be guilty of a breach of honour and of great indis-cretion; but, to give that information in a court of justice, which by the law of the land he is bound to do, will never be imputed to him as any indiscretion whatever.&quot;And next it is relevant to cite the view expressed in the most authoritative text-book* on the principles and practice of medical jurisprudence the work, not of a lawyer, but originally of Dr. Taylor, who was in his time undoubtedly the leading English medical jurist, edited in 1910 by Dr. Smith, himself a Fellow of both the Royal Colleges, Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at the London Hospital, and Medical Referee for the Home Office.The work sets out the various points to which the attention of a medical man must necessarily be-directed, and continues (vol. I, p. 5):   &quot;It need hardly be
observed that questions of this nature are rarely noticed, except in a cursory manner^ by professors of chemistry and surgery, and a medical man is not likely to acquire the means of answering them by intuition. On the other hand, regarding ourselves as living in a civilised state, in which the detection and punishment of crime against life and property are indispensable to the security of all, it is impossible to overrate their importance., Unless a witness is able to return answers to these questions when a public necessity, occurs, a guilty man may escape punishment, or an innocent man may be condemned .... Again, the dead body of an infant is, to a healer of the sick, a corpse, and nothing more; he is too late to be of use; but to the medical jurist it is a human sphinx from which he is expected to extract answers to many questions. Was it mature or immature? . Could it have been, and was it, born alive? If so, how long did it live? Was it killed, and-if so, how? Or did it die a natural death ? If so, why ? On the answers to these questions may hang the life of a fellow-creature, or at least the honour of a sister.&quot;Perhaps the most useful method of presenting the matter will be to do so by way of illustration.The first class of case in which a doctor may be in doubt as to his duty, owing to his consciousness of a divided obligation, on the one hand, to his patient, and, on the other, to the State, arises where, in the course of his practice, he comes upon circumstances which suggest to his mind that a crime has been committed. It is certainly not his duty to act as a spy or a detective. But there are cases where that which was originally a mere suspicion has hardened, either immediately or in the course of his observation of the patient, into a certainty. The question then is whether he is discharged from his ordinary duty of a citizen. I am not speaking of cases where the mind of the doctor becomes aware before the commission of the crime that a crime is contemplated or is actually in course of execution. In those cases his duty is plain; And, as an example of the looseness of thinking, and, I must add, the levity with which these matters are sometimes discussed, even by learned and honourable men, I would mention a story which was told, apparently with com-placency, at a professional assembly.A doctor, in ,the course of his attendance upon a sick man, found that the patienfs wife, apparently in great distress at the course of his illness, waited upon him hand and foot and nursed him and took care that no food or medicine reached his lips except such as she prepared or administered. The diagnosis was obscure. At length the doctor was forced to the conclusion that the patient was dying of slow poisoning, and that the only hand by which the poison could be administered was that of the wife. He sought counsel from a brother practitioner and he received advice. On the next occasion of his visit to his patient the wife asked him anxiously whether he did not notice some improvement. &quot; No,&quot; he replied, &quot; and were it not that I knew that you prepared his food I should have said that your husband was dying of poisoning.&quot; The consequences were immediate. The patient began to mend, and in the course of a week, when he had begun to regain his strength, the wife left the house with another man.This was actually applauded as an instance of the tact whereby professional secrecy may be maintained and its evil consequences averted. As a guide to the aspiring student I can conceive no more dangerous precedent. Consider the facts and the looseness of the reasoning employed. If any relation of confidence existed, it was between the doctor and the poisoned man. On no construction could it be maintained that the practitioner had any duty to the guilty wife. Yet he assumes that his tongue is tied, that he must impale himself upon the horns of a dilemma, and must either see a murder contrived and committed under his eyes or take such steps as would ensure the escape of the would-be murderess. Suppose that she had not acted upon the hint; suppose that she desisted for the time and resumed her work at a later date with another doctor or with no doctor in attendance. This is not the class of case which I have in mind as presenting any doubt to a reasonable man.But I must add this. Cases of murder by poisoning are more frequent than is commonly imagined. In many such cases some doctor has had some chance of observing something to put him on his guard. In every such case it is on the doctor&apos;s evidence that the strength of the prosecution must depend.Contrast with the curious doctrine which I have set out above that stated by Dr. Taylor and his editors. &quot;Here one must always remember that a doctor is or should be the confidential friend of his patients, at least so far as professional matters are concerned, and police and. detective work form no proper part of his
ordinary duties. One would say, therefore, exhaust the diplomatic methods before ^resorting to the police. ... On the other hand, such cases usually are crimes of the very deepest dye, and in bringing such to the notice of the police there is no need to consider the feelings of the scoundrels who would perpetrate such horrors. . . . When a practitioner is aware of a case of poisoning it &quot;is necessary that he should know to what points he ought to give his attention. Every effort should be made by him to save life when the individual is living; but while engaged on one duty it is also in his power to perform another, supposing the case to be one of suspected criminal poisoning, namely, to note down many circumstances which may tend to detect the perpetrator of a crime. There is no person so well fitted to observe these points as a medical man, but it unfortunately happens that many facts, important as evidence, are often overlooked. ... A medical man need not make himself officious on such occasions, but he would be unmindful of his duty as a member of society if he did not aid the cause of justice by extending his scientific knowledge to the detection of crime.&apos;&apos;This is the true doctrine and the old doctrine, and the idea that the professional relation justifies the doctor in refusing his aid to the execution of the law is as novel as it is extravagant.I would come next to a case or a series of cases which depend, not on the -anecdotal reminiscences of professional geniality, but upon the records of the police.Last year an East End doctor was put on his trial for murder. The circum-stances were particularly atrocious. While he was in the act of performing the operation of abortion upon a woman she collapsed and died, and her body was found in an entry not far from the surgery, whence it had been conveyed under cover of night by the doctor. The jury took a merciful view of his case, and he was, in fact, convicted of manslaughter; but the interest of the case for the present purpose lies in the discoveries made in his house by the police during the course of their enquiry. The doctor, whatever his skill as a surgeon may have been, possessed an orderly mind, and kept a record, signed in each case by the patient, of those upon whom he had performed a similar operation, and the documents disclosed evidence of some 400 cases of abortion performed by him.It is obvious to anyone who has any experience of what usually happens in cases of this kind that very many of the women concerned must have come under the observation of other medical men in the course of their convalescence, and the condition of those women and the means whereby it had been procured must have become apparent to them. Between those women and those doctors there no doubt existed the relation of doctor and patient, and, relying as they must have done upon this relation, not one of those doctors gave such assistance to the police as would have enabled them to take proceedings. This open shop for the performance of felony and murder might still have been in active operation but for the accident of this poor woman&apos;s death. When one thinks calmly of the many other deaths which must have ensued as a consequence of the operations upon the 400 women concerned, when one thinks of the ruined health and shattered lives which could be traced, if we knew all the facts, to that one small East End surgery, one becomes impatient of a claim set up by a medical practitioner that he is entitled, under a plea of privilege, to neglect the obvious duty of a citizen and to abstain from giving to the proper authority information which would have saved many a life and put an end to a social pest. This is not an isolated case.In June 1916 a single woman, whom I will call X, was in the employment of Dr. A. She became unwell. Dr. A called in a Dr. B, who suggested her removal to a hospital, but she declined this and went away with a friend to the latter&apos;s house. The friend called in a third doctor, C, but she wished her own doctor, D, to be employed, and he was fetched. D sent her to a nursing home, where she told the principal that she had used an instrument herself to procure abortion. D for some reason turned the case over to a fifth doctor, E, who attended her till her death, before which a sixth doctor, F, was called in to operate. The post mortem revealed the fact that she had been operated upon for abortion by a skilled person, and a verdict of murder against some person unknown was returned .at the inquest. Until after the death, no communication was made to the police by any of these doctors, some of whom must have known and others of whom must have suspected what had happened, and as a result the culprit was not discovered.I will give yet another case. In February 1918 a married woman had a miscar-riage. and a doctor was called in. A specialist was also called and she was taken to a nursing home. At a subsequent date, the two doctors found it necessary to operate upon her in the presence of a third doctor, an anaesthetist.
The doctors were apparently convinced that an illegal operation had been performed.   The anaesthetist questioned her, and she made a statement that anN operation had been performed on her by a man, whose name she gave.    The anaesthetist questioned the man, who denied it.She subsequently died, and the post mortem disclosed that she had been origin-ally operated upon by a skilled person.       ..No information was given to the police until after the death. The statement to the anaesthetist was useless as evidence, as it was not in the form of a dying declaration. The coroner&apos;s jury returned a verdict of murder against the man named, but in the absence of any evidence, except the statement of the woman, which could not be put in, the Attorney-General was forced to enter a nolle prosequi.I have before me particulars of numerous other cases, which in their turn are only samples from many which are in the experience of the police. In all these cases the&quot; doctor may plead that in respecting his clients confidence he was obeying his professional etiquette. Such a plea is frivolous. The result has been in each case that a criminal has escaped from prosecution and in all probability that a person who makes a trade of crime has been enabled to continue his or her operations. It must also be recollected that the woman in this class of case is equally a criminal she is generally the instigator of the crime. The attitude of doctors in some of these cases almost makes one regret that the offence of &quot; misprision of felony &quot; has been allowed to become obsolete.But in all these cases the doctor found himself finally obliged either to tender information to the police or to give information when called upon. There must be many cases where, whether death has resulted or not, the crime has remained undetected. These illustrations relate to cases in which criminal abortions have been procured or attempted a class of crime which is rife in various parts of the country and amongst many classes, and very largely resorted to by married women. Probably in all but a very few, a medical man is consulted at some stage or another&apos;. These crimes, which are not only dangerous to the woman but highly mischievous to the community at the present time, might well, be materially reduced in number if medical men considered their duty as citizens at least as highly as their supposed duty of keeping secret their patients&apos; misdeeds.I pass to another class of case arising under the criminal law where the relation of doctor and patient has never been established and where the claim made by the practitioner is indeed amazing. This class of case is of especial interest because it arises in connection with the clinics for venereal disease, in relation to which the present controversy has become acute. I shall have something to say at a later stage on the subject of the necessity for secrecy with regard to patients who visit these clinics, and with regard to the necessary and important work which they perform. The case, however, which I am about to mention cannot seriously be put forward as covered by the need for secrecy, and, as I have already said, no plea for secrecy can be urged by reason of the professional relation.A doctor in attendance at one of these clinics sent to a laboratory a sample of blood for the. purpose of its examination under the Wassermann test. All that is known by the laboratory staff with reference to&apos;the specimen is that it comes from a male person of a stated age and that the report is required in connection with legal proceedings. At a subsequent date another specimen taken from a female child is sent to the same laboratory for a similar purpose.In both cases the result of the test conducted by the doctor at the laboratory is positive, that is to say, it indicates that both the persons from whom the specimens were taken were suffering from syphilis. The doctor from the clinic, making no claim for privilege, appears to give evidence at the police court, upon a charge against the male of the most revolting character. The laboratory assistant, a medical man, attends the police court and protests against being called upon to give evidence, and the laboratory staff contend that the test should not be used against the accused without his consent and that the laboratory staff ought not to give evidence without his consent. Such a claim is preposterous. . Here we have the police authorities, in proper execution of their duty, seeking to put into force a statute, intended to protect women and children of tender age from outrage. Everyone knows how difficult of proof these cases are. What kind of confidential relation has been set up between this elderly syphilitic violator of his own child and the laboratory staff to whom he is only known through the specimen of a sample of his blood&quot;? What possibility is there of procuring evidence, which must in any circumstances be difficult to procure andsirksome to give, if the members of the medical profession refuse their assistance to the police in matters of this kind ?
The next case presents still more curious features.On the 13th May, 1918, a child, whom I will call X, was taken to a London hospital by her mother and was there examined. Though no statement has ever been obtained from the hospital, the examination must have disclosed what was in fact the case; that is, that she had been violated in circumstances of peculiar atrocity and that syphilis had been communicated to her.As a result of attendance at this hospital as an outpatient, she was on the 17th May sent to the Lock hospital, of which, she became an inmate.If information had been given immediately to the police by the authorities at the first hospital, it is possible that the man might have been apprehended immediately.  As it was, he absconded.The police, however, to whom complaint had been made by the mother, proceeded with their inquiry, and on the 20th May sent a detective inspector to the Lock hospital to ask the doctor whether he would give a statement as to the condition of the child. The doctor stated orally that the child was suffering from syphilis, but refused to give a written statement without the authority of the secretary to the hospital.On the 21st May a woman in the employment of the police called at the hospital by appointment to take a statement from the child. On her arrival she was refused permission to see the child without written authority from the mother. The, statement made by this lady of the various obstructions she encountered on this occasion is of some interest, but is too long for insertion here. Written authority was obtained, and the statement was taken on the 23rd May.&quot;On the same day, the assistant commissioner in charge of the case wrote to the secretary asking whether the doctor who attended the patient might be allowed to give a statement as to her condition. This also was refused by a letter dated the 7th June. On the 19th June the assistant commissioner repeated his request or asked in the alternative that the divisional surgeon might be allowed to examine the child.An answer was received on the 21st giving permission for the divisional surgeon to examine the child provided another written authority was received from the mother. This also was obtained, and on the 26th June the divisional surgeon examined and reported upon her. Meanwhile, the man had returned to London and was apprehended on the 24th June. It is difficult to understand whether these refusals were put upon the&quot; ground of privilege. If so, the situation and the nature of the privilege deserve consideration. The child is 10 years old. She has been taken to a Lock hospital. If any prejudice is likely to accrue to her by reason of the outrage which she has suffered, it has accrued already. The whole proceedings were started upon a complaint made by her mother. I must state plainly that there is no use in strengthening the law for the protection of women and children from outrages of this kind if, when the police begin to investigate such a charge--and the charge in this case was of an unusual degree of gravity they are delayed for five weeks before any statement can be obtained upon which an information can be laid.The matter, however, does not rest there. The venereal disease clinics are performing work of great importance to the national health. No one would desire to hinder them; no one would desire to do anything but assist them in the purpose which they and their designers have in view. By reason, however, of the success which they are already achieving they either have in attendance at them, or have at their command as pathologists in laboratories which are not directly under their control, almost a monopoly of those scientific men who have a knowledge of the diseases in question and are competent to conduct the technical tests which modern science has discovered. It is to those doctors, whether serving in the clinics themselves or in the laboratories, that anyone who wishes to obtain information on these subjects must necessarily apply. People who have experience of assize courts and courts of quarter sessions (either as lawyers or as connected with societies for the protection of women or children) know the difficulty in which the prosecution is always placed when the person upon whom the outrage has been committed is a child of tender years. In only too many of these cases, corroborative evidence of what the child has suffered is to be found in the condition of the child&apos;s body and an examination of her blood. The only chance of a conviction rests in satisfactory evidence on these matters being placed before the court, and it is, as I have said, from these doctors alone that that evidence can be obtained. It is surely monstrous that&quot;, when that evidence is sought, some fancied obligation towards the actual victim of the[6815] ^ C
crime is to be set up as a bar to making the statement. And be it observed &quot;that the difficulty is not resolved merely because the doctor, when called upon his subpoena, in fact, appears, however reluctantly, and gives his evidence to the court. It is essential that that evidence should have been given in a form of statement to the Crown when the original question of whether proceedings should be taken at all was under the consideration of the Crown&apos;s advisers. On the other hand,&quot;this early information may well be of the greatest advantage to some person suspected of having criminally communicated the disease to the child, in entirely removing at an early stage in the inquiry any ground of suspicion.The next example to which I draw attention raises the question in a slightly different form. The Public Prosecutor, dealing with a case which arose in an English country district relating to a child between 5 and 6 years of age, found it necessary to communicate with the medical superintendent of a hospital for venereal diseases, at which the man suspected of, the offence had presented himself for treatment. The medical superintendent acknowledged the letter and gave no information. He was subsequently called upon proceedings before the magistrates. He thereupon objected to be sworn on the ground that he could not be called upon to disclose the confidence of his patient. The gentleman representing the Crown-insisted that the doctor was bound to take the oath and answer all questions, and he was accordingly sworn and gave evidence, but when he was asked the result of his examination.of the accused man, he said that he claimed privilege as his medical adviser and on the ground that all persons suffering from venereal diseases had been invited to submit themselves for treatment and had been promised secrecy. The magistrates overruled the claim for privilege, and the doctor then gave the result of his observation in the prisoners case.It will be observed that in this case the plea that a professional relation between a doctor at a venereal clinic and a man who there presents himself for treatment is put forward fairly and squarely as a ground on which the doctor&apos;s duty as a citizen to assist the court in arriving at the truth is to be abrogated. The quarrel here, if there be a quarrel, is not between the law, on the one hand, and the medical pro-fession, on the other. It is between those who claim this privilege and the parents of little children whose protection is the primary aim of the law. I will not labour the point. I believe it is enough to- state the facts and leave them to the judgment of those whose special interest is the protection of women and children, and, lastly, of every father and every mother in the country.It may be that a knowledge that a criminal suffering from these diseases cannot hope that the fact that he suffers from them will remain undisclosed;, if his crime comes to be investigated, may deter persons so suffering from presenting themselves for treatment, and I fully admit that anything which tends so to deter is in itself an evil. Is it so great an evil, is it likely to&apos; prove so great a deterrent that we are on that account alone to break into the whole structure of our system of criminal jurisprudence? The extent of the ravages of this disease is very great. Fortunately, a very small proportion indeed of those who suffer from it nave any reason to apprehend any criminal proceedings against them. There is not the least reason why those who, however indiscreet or unfortunate their conduct may have been, are innocent of any offence against the criminal law should be deterred from seeking the treatment which they know can alone relieve them from great suffering merely by the knowledge that criminals who seek the same advantages do so at their peril.I have dealt at such length and with such particularity with cases arising in connection with the criminal law, not because I think that there could be any reasonable doubt upon the subject, but so that all may be made fully aware of the situation and, so far as it is possible in matters of this kind, so that we may hear no more of claims in this regard and, if I may say so, so that the obstruction of which I have spoken may cease. That obstruction is, I am sure, based not upon the unwillingness of the medical profession to do their duty, but upon the fact that it has not been brought home to them by illustration and argument how important is the aid which they can give to the detection of crime and the administration of justice. -I pass to the more debatable ground of civil -proceedings. Here the case put forward is more plausible and, therefore, possibly more dangerous.Let me, in the first place, point out what it is which is claimed. It is that there should be established in this country a class possessing a privilege outside the law, such as is conferred on no other citizen and no other profession. The privilege claimed, for the reasons which I have already given, presents no analogy to that of
the barrister or solicitor, except when it arises in circumstances which will protect a communication to a medical man equally with that made to a barrister or a solicitor, that is to say, when it is made in contemplation or in the course of litigation. But as regards other communications, what case has been made out for this establishment of a privileged class and this inroad upon the law ? It has been said that the cases in which such a privilege could be invoked are few. No doubt this is true, but this very fact is in itself an argument against the concession. The law is administered under the control of judges of experience,-each one of whom must himself at some time or another in his life have been the patient of some doctor. They are not men whose minds are biassed against the medical profession nor men who would wantonly outrage the canons of decent feeling. They may be relied upon to compel an answer only in circumstances which imperatively demand that an answer should be given. There is no question here of any liability upon the profession to make any statement in advance or to give a proof to either side. The only question is whether, when the doctor, appearing on his subpoena, is asked a question, and it is proper in the view of the judge that he should answer it, he or the judge is to decide that question.I have already called attention to the fact that it cannot be said that the confidence is always to be inviolable. Cases must arise where, apart from any legal proceedings, a doctor, between two divided duties, must himself decide to neglect the one in obedience to the superior claim of the other. And this is apparent from the fact that, when at the meeting of the British Medical Association in 1920 the very illustration with which I commenced this memorandum was put to the assembly, there were divergent cries of &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No &quot; from the experienced practitioners there collected. It is not without interest to notice in what spirit the claim which we are now discussing is sometimes put forward. Only the other day a medical officer of a venereal clinic refused to disclose the confidence reposed in him by his patient, although his patient, desirous so far as he could to repair the injury which he had done to his wife, himself asked the doctor to give evidence as to his condition. &apos;&apos; It appears to me that it is. a misuse of the services of the medical officers of this clinic to compel them to come up to furnish evidence for divorce, as in this case where the man made use of his attendance at the clinic as a proof of his adultery.&quot; So the doctor wrote on this particular occasion surely an amazing view of the duties of a citizen called to testify before the law courts of his country upon an issue of grave importance both to man and wife.It is unnecessary for me to combat seriously such a claim as this. What we have to look at is the case where a doctor is called as a witness in civil proceedings and is asked to give evidence against his patienfs will of the symptoms which he has observed in him. Let me suggest an illustration of the circumstances in which this might occur. A. B. files his petition for divorce, alleging adultery on the part of his wife with a man unknown, and supports his plea by the allegation that she has acquired syphilis and communicated it to him. The wife admits that she is infected, but she replies that her husband was the origin of the infection. The facts on which the reputation of these two parties depends are known to the doctor and him alone. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the husband&apos;s story is true. Is he to be precluded from clearing himself from so infamous an allegation and be denied that relief to which, upon proof of the facts, he is justly entitled? Let us assume, on the other hand, that the wife&apos;s story is true. Is she to continue under the burden of this charge when she can be cleared perhaps by a simple sentence from the doctor ? This is merely an illustration, though one calculated to strike the imagination, of the kind of difficulty which would arise were the claim admitted in civil cases. It is necessary, to arrive at a conclusion, to consider in analysis in what other classes of cases the doctor&apos;s evidence may be essential to the elucidation of the truth.The first and most obvious is the action for what is called in somewhat barbarous jargon malpraxis, that is, improper or negligent treatment of the patient by the doctor. It is too clear for argument that if the patient brings his action on this ground against the doctor attending him, the mouth of, the latter must be opened in self-defence. Is it not equally clear that any other doctor who has been in atten-dance upon the case must be both a competent and a compellable witness on either side ? It may be alleged in such an action that the operating surgeon has wrongfully performed an unnecessary operation, and thereby, it may be, inflicted some harm upon or some permanent impairment of the body of the patient. Is he not to be entitled to call in his defence the general practitioner in attendance upon the patient to testify perhaps to the patienfs condition before the operation was conducted ? Cases are not infrequent in which it is alleged that the patient, having been put[6815] D
under anaesthesia for one purpose, has been made the victim of an operation for another purpose. The truth can only be arrived at by the statements of the other medical men present.Again, it not infrequently happens that insurance companies defend actions upon policies of life insurance, alleging that material questions in the form of proposal have been answered incorrectly, and that they have been induced to enter into a contract of insurance by the statement that the proposer has not suffered from some named disease. On such questions the medical practitioner in ordinary atten-dance upon the deceased is a material, perhaps the only material, witness on either side. It cannot be that he is to be excluded from giving evidence altogether. Still less would it be consonant with the ordinary doctrines of fair play which distin-guish our jurisprudence if he were to be a competent and compellable witness for the plaintiff but not for the defendant. Be it observed that the relation of confidence in this case is not released, if it ever existed, by the death of the patient. Upon the extreme medical theory it never can be released, but it would be intolerable that it should only be defeasible upon the motion of one party to the litigation and not to the other.Next comes the class of case in which . paternity is in question. In these actions not only may the reputation of parties depend upon a right decision, but there may be involved the title to dignities or to great estates and large sums of money. The Duchess of Kingston&apos;s case was of this class. It was in form a criminal trial at the Bar of the House of Lords upon an accusation of bigamy. The defendant was the famous Miss Chudleigh, who, even if her subsequent matrimonial adventures had not earned her a memorial in English jurisprudence, would be well known by reason of her frequent appearance in Horace WalpokVs letters. The question was whether that lady, who had gone through a form of marriage with the Duke of Kingston, had been previously married to Mr. Hervey (at the time, of the trial Lord Bristol), and whether she had borne a child to him. Mr. Hawkins&apos;s evidence, to which allusion has already been made, was directed to proving the birth of the child, No title or estates or legitimacy were, in fact, at stake, for the child died shortly after birth. But it is obvious that, if the child had lived, a question might have arisen such as that in the famous Douglas Cause or in the great Annesley trial, and it would have been almost impossible to prove the birth of the child except through the testimony of Mr. Hawkins. It would be a strange anomaly if in those circumstances when the evidence of the doctor was to be available upon the criminal charge it was hot to be available in civil proceedings arising out of the same events.Similar questions have arisen in more recent cases. Probably the Slingsby case will be within the recollection of everyone. The doctor&apos;s position in that case was peculiar, and it illustrates not only now essential it is to the ends of justice that the medical testimony should be available both for civil and for criminal preceedings, but also how complex a situation would arise if the plea of confidence were to be established. In that case, according to the evidence of Mrs. Slingsby, the doctor who attended her in her confinement was the best witness who could be called to prove that she had in fact borne a child. The doctor, however, was called as a witness hostile to the claim of the infant petitioner. His story was that he had attended in her confinement a single woman named Lillian Anderson, and that he had subse-quently been instrumental in handing the child to Mrs. Slingsby and in procuring the making of false entries and false certificates to cover what he had done, and to establish that the child was Mrs. Slingsby&apos;s. According to Mrs. Slingsby&apos;s story, the doctor had assisted her in her alleged delivery of a child. He was, on this assumption, in a relation of confidence to her, and, upon the medical theory, he could only have been called, if at all, with her leave. According to his statement, he was in no confidential relation to Mrs. Slingsby, except that confidential relation which arises between persons who conspire to commit a fraud. But he was, on his own statement, in a confidential relation to Lillian Anderson, and, without that confidence being broken, it would have been extremely difficult to defeat the claim, which the Courts have held to be fraudulent, or, if any criminal proceedings had followed, to present to the Court the case against the parties to the alleged fraud. On the other hand, if proceedings had been taken against the persons who were alleged to have devised the fraud and they had in fact been innocent, the gravest injustice would have followed if they had been unable to call the doctor merely because he was in a confidential relation to a third party.When these and similar cases are considered, a further question arises. Communications are made in maternity cases to other persons besides the doctor,
who stand in a relation of qualified confidence towards the patient. The nurse as well as the doctor is admitted to an intimacy of knowledge which is inconsistent with any revelation by her of what she has heard or seen except under the compulsion of the law. Are the communications to, and the observations made by, the doctor to be alone privileged or is this to be extended to the nurse ? There are thousands of cases every year in which in a confinement the only person in attendance is a midwife. Is her evidence to be available while that of the doctor, if he chances to be present, is to be excluded 1Again, the doctor has no monopoly of medical practice. He is by law the only person entitled to sue for fees in respect of attendance as a physician. But anyone may attend a sick person. There are sects which deliberately reject medical aid and prefer to rely upon spiritual assistance, employing for that purpose persons who, as they believe, have a special skill in spiritual, though not in medical, matters. There are other large classes of the population who have recourse to herbalists; others take the advice of chemists on certain matters, and others resort to persons of skill in dealing with particular ailments as, for example, bone setters, who have no medical qualification.The chemist, moreover, even where he acts solely as the compounder or seller of the medicine prescribed by the doctor, is, constructively at least, the recipient of confidence. He is a responsible professional man, admitted by examination to a class which has a strong professional feeling and a high code of ethics. The patient must rely on his technical skill and on his discretion. The ingredients named in the prescription may, and often do, indicate to him facts as to the patienfs condition which may be material in civil or in criminal cases.  What is to be his position?Are the Christian scientist healer, the herbalist, the quack, the bone setter, the chemist, to be covered by the same doctrine as the doctor ? If not, on what logical theory is the distinction to be based?The matter does not rest there. The complexities of life in a civilised com-munity such as our own produce a web of confidential relations and confidential communications round every citizen. The universal system of banking in this country puts almost everyone into a relation to his banker which is intended to be confidential and is respected as such by-the banker. And apart from the confidence which every customer expects of a banker in the keeping of his private account, there come to many people times when a full disclosure to the banker of their financial state is essential and can in practice only be made upon a footing of confidence. Is it to be said that when either criminal or civil proceedings arise that confidence is to remain absolute ? The whole policy of our law with relation to bankruptcy makes it clear that in these commercial relations a time comes when, for the safety of the total trading community, the obligation of confidence must give way before a more overwhelming necessity.What, then, about the confidential relation between a master and his clerks, between two partners, between principal and agent ? In all these cases there is rightly a confidential relation and in none of these cases would it be contended that the secrecy must not be broken when the law commands.Lastly, on this head there is the most intimate relation of all that between a man and his wife. The law on this subject is intricate and it has only reached its present condition through a series of stages. By the common law of England persons interested in the result of a civil or criminal trial, either as a party or as the husband or wife of the party, were incompetent to give evidence at the trial. This, so far as the incompetence depended upon the marriage tie, was based not so much upon the idea of confidence as upon the theory that husbands or wives were more likely to commit perjury than to tell the truth to the disadvantage of their respective spouses. So far as civil causes are concerned, this state of affairs was finally brought to an end by the Evidence Amendment Act, 1853, under which in any action or arbitration husbands and wives of the parties to the proceeding were made competent and com-pellable witnesses, subject, however, to the provision that no husband is compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during the marriage, and no wife is compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during the marriage. This qualification &quot; rests on the obvious ground that the admission of such testimony would have a powerful tendency to disturb the peace of families, to promote domestic broils, and to weaken, if not to destroy, that feelino- of mutual confidence, which is the most endearing solace of married life.&quot; (Taylor on Evidence, 10th edit., vol. I, p. 642.) It is worthy of note that it extends to communi-cations only. Those matters which the husband or the wife has observed in the conduct of the other must if material, be disclosed.
In criminal matters, the law, after many alterations, is embodied in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1898, which enacts that every person charged with an offence.and the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so charged shall be a competent witness for the defence at every stage of the proceeding, whether the person so charged is charged solely or jointly with any other person. The Act con-tains certain safeguards. The wife or husband of a person charged is not to be called except upon the application of the prisoner and, as in civil proceedings, the husband is not compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during the marriage, or the wife compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during the marriage. Further, under certain other statutes the wife or husband is a compellable witness, either for the prosecution or the defence, without the consent of the person charged. These statutes are : The Vagrancy Act, The Offences Against the Person Act, The Married Woman&apos;s Property Act, Criminal Law Amendment Act, Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, and The Incest Act. The history of this legislation illustrates once again the policy of the law, which is in itself the fruit of the experience of the courts. One by one, barriers which the caution of our predecessors erected have been removed so that there may be open, whether to the plaintiff or defendant, whether to the Crown or the prisoner, every possible means of elucidating the truth consonant with the fundamental structure of the society in which we live.It is clear that no general statutory prohibition against disclosure by the doctor in the witness box is consistent with the administration of justice. Civil suits are sometimes thought to be of less importance to the community than the execution of criminal justice. But, on the orderly determination of the issues which arise in civil proceedings, not only may there depend the happiness of the parties immediately concerned, but, rightly considered, the authority of the State itself dealing out that impartial justice between man and.man and man and woman which is-essential to the well-being of the modern community. The whole tendency of our law for many years has been in the direction of opening the mouths of those who can assist the course of justice and not of closing them; in reducing those classes whose testimony, for whatever reason, cannot be accepted in a court of law rather than in increasing them, and in this, as in other matters, breaking down barriers of privilege for each of which perhaps before it fell a sturdy argument might be adduced. The obliga-tion of silence with regard to professional communications to lawyers has, on the other hand, of late years become more extensive. It has, in fact, grown, as circum-stances required, under the hand of the judiciary, who can be trusted to curb any abuse of it. But it is not such a privilege as is now claimed. Now, to establish a class who may at their will assist or obstruct the judges in their work would be a retrograde step not justified by any argument which has been brought forward. These are the opinions not only of myself, speaking with all the responsibility which accrues to me as Lord Chancellor, but of the late Lord Chief Justice, the present Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, and the President of the Probate Division, all men of great experience in every branch of the law. I have no doubt that that opinion is also shared by the great majority-perhaps by all of the judges of the High Court. It is shared by those most fitted to give an opinion at the Bar. I am convinced that it is consonant with the whole scheme of our judicial history, and that it rests upon a solid basis of equity and of common sense.B.September 30, 1921.
