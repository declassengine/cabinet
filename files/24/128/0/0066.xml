IIS D0GUMS1TT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT AMI C MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT).E ORE T.*P* 3367.CABINET.llso 0.1.D. 152-C).RESERVES OP OIL FUEL FOR THE ROYAL NAVY.&apos;  (Note by the Secretary, Cabinet.)t-A Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CI.D. Paper No. 145-C) on &quot;Reserves of Oil Fuel for the Royal Navy&quot;, and a note by the Naval Staff on the same subject (CI.D. Paper No. 147-C.) have been under the consideration of Mr. Balfour&apos;s Stand-ing Defence Sub-Committee.In view of the financial situation, the original proposals of the Admiralty, as contained in C.I.D. Paper No. 145-C., were re-examined and modified by that Department at the request of the Standing Defence Sub-Committee, which at a subsequent meeting concurred generally in the modified proposals, and decided to submit the question to the Cabinet.The following conclusion on the question has been   agreed to.by the members of the Standing Defence Sub-Committee and is submitted for consideration:-CONCLUSION BY THE STANDING DEFENCE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE ON &quot;RESERVES OF OIL FUEL FOR THE   ROYAL NAVY&quot;.&quot;The Committee note that the modified proposals of the Admiralty aim at the provision, spread over a period of seven years, of reserves of oil fuel on the Singapore route, which from a strategic point of view is the one of most immediate importance. This scheme will entail an expenditure of two million pour-o.s in the first year, the subsequent annual cost being left for further consideration.The Committee further note that, in the opinion of the Admiralty, the adoption of this scheme by no meuns covers all the needs of the Navy in respect of fuel reserves, and that it represents therefore the minimum in which the Naval Staff is prepared to acquiesce
acquiesce.The Committee concur generally in the views held &quot;by the Admiralty, and are anxious that the scheme should &quot;be approved.   On the other hand, they recognise that, in the enforced absence of the Chancellor from the present meeting, the recommendation that the Admiralty should be allowed to spend up to two million pounds in the first year must be   subject to any criticism which he may have to offer when the matter comes before the Cabinet.   At a previous meeting the Chancellor was understood to express the view that      million pounds could probably be found in the first year, and that anything less than this amount was unlikely to be sufficient, but on that occasion he did not go further.&quot;(Sgd.)   M.P.A. HAliJKSY,Secretary, Cabinet.whitehall Gardens, S.&apos;7. 5th October, 1921.
