4      &apos;     &quot;    /3 6 8THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GO VERBMEHT.jSECRET. CP. 3378.CABINET.IRAQ, - THE EXTERNAL SITUATION.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner, Iraq, to the Secre-cciry of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office 10.26 p.m. 29th September,1921).(Circulated by the Secretary of State . for the Colonies).No. 534- dated 28th September.The following seem to be the salient features of existing external situation.(l)   By brilliant strategy and grand tactics Mustapha Kemal has crushed Greek offensive.     We may therefore assume that he entirely overshadows Enver Pasha at the moment and that predominantly-nant note&apos; i\ Anatolian politics is pan-Turanian and (?there&apos;f ore) anti-Belshevxk,   At the same time we know that Kemalists fear the Bolshevik troops massed on thoir borders and have retained in command of their Eastern troops, their trusted anti-Bolshevik generals.     The strengthening of Erzeroum and demolition of Kars are obviously directed   against possible Bolshevik menace. The . pan-Turanian policy of Mustapha does not contemplate a Turkifica* tion of Arab provinces but he himself is persuaded that strength of Greeks has been due to British and accordingly he has&quot;done his best to damage British interests here.   His objection is not to Arab independence but to British run(ning) Iraq.   As I understand situation it is not point of British policy to fall foul of Mustapha unless he falls foul of us,   have no knowledge of secret support alleged to have been accorded by us to Greeks. But I assume it is still intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure if possible friendly (l group) on borders of Iraq. At the present moment when Bolshevik influence in Anatolian
Colonial Office, S.W.I. October 7th, 1921.politics must &quot;be at its (?weak)eet, when fear of Bolshevik agression is nevertheless ever present, when moreover the rapid spreading influence of Russia in Persian politics must be a disquieting factor to Turks, time appears to be ripe for a further attempt at negotiations with Feisal to endeavour to open informal negotiations.   I&apos; am alive to risk attendant on attempt which Mustapha will inevitably mice to turn Peisal against British but so satisfied do I feel of Feisal&apos;s loyalty to us that I am convinced it is a risk we can well afford to run.     It is impossible to escape the strong suspicion that Mustapha&apos;s negotiations with French will have resulted in a further poisoning of his mind against us and should negotiations with Feisal be successfully initiated would serve as a useful antidote.     Further.should Feisal prove successful in suggested attempt his prestige will be enormously increased and his throne secured beyond all expectations, for not only would he remove danger but he would convert it into a source of strength. I-am&quot; unaware if His&apos; Majesty&apos;s Government have other and better means of access?!to Mustapha j if not I venture to suggest I discuss problem with Feisal and convey him assurance His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome his taking steps to initiate negotiations with Mustapha with a view to formulation cf an agreement. .  That the present moment,is one not to be lost I feel very strongly and beg favour of early reply.
