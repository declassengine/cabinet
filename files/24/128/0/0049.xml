My Livemool correspondent comments on tne pitiable appearance of some of the demonstrators and ssys that tnere is a growing feeling among them that something is wrong with our social system.There has been no serious disorder during the week, but at a patriotic meeting in London last night organised opposition broke up the meeting and tore up the Union Jack, seriously assaulting a man who tried to prevent it.Further evidence is given of the practical identity between the National Administrative Council of Unemployed and the instruc-tions given from Moscow regarding the agitation among the unemployed.Thursday, October 13th, has been fixed for &quot;monster&quot; demonstra-tions throughout the country.    They are to be simultaneous in order to prevent police forces from reinforcing one another. -The imprisoned Poplar Guardians demand unconditional release before there is any conference with t.&apos;ie Government.The Communist Party ht.s made incorrect returns of trie Caerphilly Election expenses to the Returning Officer.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and &quot;The Communist&quot; are publishing articles which amount to incitement to violence.The miners are approaching the Government in respect of the unexpended balance of the subvention.The engineers have failed to agree with employers and haveappealed/
appealed to the Minister of Labour to exercise his power under the Industrial Courts Aot and so effect, a settlement.In Ireland matters have taken a turn for the worse.   Collii has &quot;been circulating a report that there is disagreement in the Cabinet1and that full advantage must he taken of it.
THE unemployed on Sep-tembeT-JL6th the wholly unemployed, who are still in receipt of the--xmemployment donation, numbered 1,469,700 and on September 9th the partially employed numbered 381,900; to the first total, however, several thousands should be added for the workers who have exhausted their benefits and have not maintained their registration and who are, in most oases, a charge on the rates.   The number of registered unemployed in London on September 16th was 137,526, apart from short time workers.According to reports received there has been a further alight decrease in the number of unemployed meetings and in the. number of demonstrators: about 60,000 people have attended meetings in the following olao^s during the week: Altrincham, Batter sea (6); Birmingham, Brixton (5); Cable Street Chapel, Camberwell (3); Cardiff (Catnaps Park), Cardiff (Priory Street) Clapham (3); Clerkenwell, Palston, Honton, Socles (2); Sltham, .   Fulham (-3); Poleshill, Glasgow (4); Hoxton, Kennington, Lambeth, Lambe th (Ho rt h), Leeds, Leicester (b); Laigh, Leyton (2); Liverpool.(8); Ludworth, Newport, pontynool, Salford, Shadwell, Shepherd&apos;s Bush (5); Suoreditoh, Southampton, Southwiok, Spring bum (Glasgow), Stepnsy (2); St. Helens (2); Stratford (5); Stroud, Swansea, Tredegar, Walham Green (b); Wandsworth (4) Wfclsall, Warwick, Westminster (5); Wolverhampton, Woolwich (4).The P&amp;parliamentary Conezilttee of the Trade Union Congress and the Executive of the Labour Party have jointly submitted &quot;to the Government and the Public&quot; a lengthy statement upon the &quot;present national situation&quot; in regard to unemployment: this has been published in full in the Press and contains few new features, apart from the elaboration of certain schemes for Government trading on tho lines of State socialism.Information bearing out the instructions given to theWost/
West European Secretariat of the Third International in the circular quoted in my Report No. 123, has been received from atrustworthy source in Norway.   Work is to be carried on throughthe unemployed on the following lines:(l)    Doles are to be demanded on a scale equalling the weekly wage of the industry.(2)    &quot;As municipalities are more likely to yield tosuoh demands, the first attacks of this kind should bel directed against munioipalities.   Every kind of such activities must be directed in a way as to exclude any possibility of tracing them back to general scheme.   The demands of the workers should appear to be local demands, having no apparent connection with similar attempts in the same country.&quot;My correspondent states that the underlying object of these instructions ist&quot; (a)   To camouflage the subversive activity of the Communist Youth International.(b) To weaken municipal finance in order to compel the municipalities to apply to the respective Governments for assistance.(c) To convince the workers that it pays to be an unemployed loyal comrade.(d) To compel the various Governments by pressure of Parliament and public opinion either to provide for an unemployment bonus on a scale which is intolerable for the public purses or to oontrol both industries and technical trades by e body of member selected by the Labour organisations.&quot;My correspondent adds that in countries where labour is, as a whole, anti-Moscow communists have been instructed to avoid the use of expressions which might be unpopular, such as &quot;Workers&apos; Soviets&quot;.   Recent events have proved ttiat these instructions have been acted unon by the National Administrative Council of Unemploy9i and that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; gronp is agitating to the same   end, and it is worthy of note that P. H. Zealey, the divisional organiser of the National Administrative Council of Unemployed /for the Northern Area, has issued the following instructions to one of the local secretaries:&quot;The/
- 3 -266&quot;The first essential move towards establishing an Unemployed Movement is a Mass meeting of the people concerned, the position of the Unemployed and the necessity of a co-ordinated movement to deal with the problem, putting clearly before the meeting and arising therefrom a committee olected.&quot;Upon election the first duty of the committee suould be to immediately approach the Guardians of the Poor by DEMONSTRATION and demand adequate , maintenance; this should if possible be done peaceably and the demands substantiated by local information re the most of keeping the inmates of -:     the workhouse etc., etc.&quot;My experience teaches me that a committee of ..... : ,.. -M active Class Conscious Comrades is sufficient to meet the needs of a local movement divided,of course, into its sub-committees for detail matter such as ;;&quot;     Board of Guardians, Labour Exchange, Entertainments, General Purposes, etc.&quot; ,The Moscow Congress of the Third International in Junoand July of this year devoted considerable attention to thounemployment problem and discussed a thesis which is .reviewed by James Clunie in the current issue of the&quot;Socialist&quot;.   The following extract from this thesis explainsshortly the hopes v/hich Moscow bases upon the existingunemployment and the endeavours of the Communist Party toobtain control of the movement:&quot;By uniting the Unemployed with the proletarian Vanguards in the struggle for the Social Revolution, the Communist Party will restrain the most rebellious 1 and impatient elements among the unemployed from individual desperate acts and enable the entire mass to actively sup ort under favourable circumstances the struggle of the proletariat, thus developing beyond the limits of present conflict and making this conflict the starting point of the decisive offensive: in a word, this entire mass from a reserve army of industry will be transformed into an active army of the revolution.&quot;:   The immediate plans of the National AdministrativeCouncil of Unemployed for large demonstrations throughoutthe oountry on Thursday, October 13th, were given in myspecial reoort of September 26th.    Special leaflets arebeing printed for distribution during the &quot;week of nationalagitation.&quot;No serlbus disorders have occurred in the London area during the week, but windows of houses belonging to twoCroydon Guardians were smashed on September 27th and two cases/
cases of house vsel.&amp;ing.,have occurred in- Shepherd1 s Bush;      . , inspiration seems to have come in each case, from, bhe local unemployed committee,&apos; the chairman of which is Charles French, alias Pinch, &quot;alias &quot;Cockney Charlie.,&quot;&apos;.;   This Tnaja-hag&quot;v&quot; a list of fourteen criminal/convictions; with sentences ranging, from 6 weeks&apos; imprisonment to 7 years1 penal servitude for. the period 1872 - 1910: .;in;/addition to stealing;Various articles he twice&apos; absconded;, from the Workhouse with clothing. On September 28th about-&apos;500 people, 300 of &quot;Mihpm were,    ..      .... .,    , ... , ....... ...... . vy   &apos;.- tiftunemployed, - attended-a meeting at Fulhata Town Hall, at which the speakers were-Sir Thomas Poison and Sir George Maik^ill. After the former had spoken&apos;for about two minutes uproar was caused by Hanson of the Pulham unemployed.   Sir George Makgill was; not. allowed to speak and: after the&quot; singing of the &quot;Ped Flag&quot; the meeting&apos;was declared closed.   A rush was then made for the platform and one young man who tried to defend the Union Jack, which hung in &quot;front of tho Chairman&apos;a&apos; table, was -brutally assa-. Ited while the Flag- was torn to. pieces.   Uniform ;.; police then entered the building, after whioh. Hanson was carried shoulder high to Pulham Church,,where he made a short speech.   Throughout&apos; the- meeting Hanson&apos;s&apos; wife: was the chief - heckler. &apos; -&quot;:       There is an unconfirmed rumour, that; the. London District Council of Unemployed is making enquiries ,among 11;s members, especially among ex-Service men who may have- souvenirs, .to ascertain if any haye arms, or tools suoh as, braces, drills and spanners. ......Haye has provided 13.H. Brown, the cornmunist..elec t i on agent at Caerphilly and a prominent member of the Communist Part y, who attended the secret meetine at lAanpheater in December, 1920, with credentials sa &quot;acting on behalf; of the National Administrative Council of UnemployedThere has been a distinct decrease in. the numbersattending/
attending unemployed meetings in the London area and there appears   to he dissension in certain committees.   Speakers on the whole are careful to keep within the law and few go further than tho &quot;D;Mly Herald&quot;, which published the following on September 26th:,. &quot;Tho Government and the class it serves havewaited   callously, indolently, when they should have been preparing.   How they must needs improvise and pay tho added price,&quot;It is useless, too, to talk of cost,   to prattle that the country cannot afford it.   The oountry can afford it.   Jewels sell in Bond Street for fabulous prices.   Society lives   its old luxurious&apos;&apos;.l&apos;i&apos;fe.   &quot;Money for nothing, is demoralising1, bleat tho scribes.   We agree.   Then.let us take it from those who are getting it for nothing, and let us spend it on those who have earned it a hundred-fold on battlefield and in wotk^shop.&quot;The workless must be fed, properly fed, and properly clothed, and properly housed, whether or not there be &quot;work for them.   And the money for . doing it must come from the moneyed classes.&quot;Unpleasant for those classes and their lackeys in the Cabinet, no doubt.   But - we warn them that it will be wise to do even this unpleasant thing, lest worse befall.&quot;We warned theta before.   We warn them now.&quot;A similar passage occurred in the leader of thefollowing day:&quot;The workless have got to be maintained. And the Government has got to find ways and means of maintaining them, not wi&apos;th promises, but with food - and to find those ways and means at onne...&quot;The \vorkless, we repeat, have got to be maintained.   And the Government has got to finance their maintenance - whatever economising that may ontail for ladies and Gentlemen of M?yfair.&quot;That is the problem that Ministers will be well advised to tackle - and not to take three weeks about it eitherI   That, and not fantastic garden Bn,Mands or mysterious and ineffective ringing of the exchanges.&quot;first things first I&quot;Will they do ii?   All the portents cry &apos;Ho*&apos;. All the rufAOurs susciest that they will dodge this vital/

September ,21st (mentioned in my ,last report), by Panning,.of .the Ce-mberwell Unemployed, vi said at Brixtonon September 24th, that&apos;he was &quot;accidentally responsible&quot;:   he explained that one of  I the C\ nberwell unemployed told him that he could not go on a march as he had:no boots:;&apos;&quot;Just for a joke&quot; Panning said, &quot;No boots - there1o plenty round the corner&quot;  Jid he &quot;nroposed&quot; the man v/ent and told others and that they took him at &quot;his word;   Fanning&apos; added thai if he had known they were going to get boots he would have gone with them, as he could do with a pair himselfSimilar sentiments were ex-nressedi by WilliamPullen, of the Fulham unemployed, v/ho, has been convictsfor gambling and obstruction at Walham Green onSeptember 26th, when he said:&quot;I suggest that if&apos; a man is starving and &apos; cannot find work and cannot get food by fair means then he must get it by foul means.   I should not  ; hesitate myself.   If you cannot obtain food by proper*. means there is no alternative but to 3teali When we were marching to Y/estmlnster the other daj you could see the old 1 toffs&quot; sitting at their cliib windows smoking cigars and- laughing at us. I saw several, near Piccadilly,, two old women tried to break through the ranks and I nearly tripped oi up.   I wish I had done so.   one of them had a fine .&apos;. rope of pearls round her neck.   I give you my word there wbuldnlt have been man^ of them left afterwards&apos; !&apos; V; IThe Leyton, Walthamstow and District Unemployed   I Organisation, which is controlled by Bay, Skipper and I Sills, has informed Haye that the oommittee &quot;hasdecideS
decided to adopt the National Administrative Council&apos;s plans for the National Week of Agitation and will carry them cut: the secretary ordered, at the same time, one thousand national cards and one thousand flags.

The largest demonstration reported this week was held in Islington Square, Liverpool, on September 27th, when it was estimated that the crowd numbered 8,000; between 40 and 50 women carrying babies hoaded the march to the ?ost Derby Guardians. With one exception all the members of the unemployed committee in Liverpool are communists but my correspondents, who are in very close touch with the unemployed, state that it would be difficult to exaggerate the seriousness of the situation arising from the plight of the genuine unemployed: on this occasion they paid particular attention to the domeanour of the marchers and state that hundreds of them looked very hungry and almost too weak to walk; the majority were very shabbily dressed but otherwise respectable, although a few were extremely dirty. My correspondents are of opinion that unless something is done speedily to alleviate the position in Liverpool there will be riots. They say that mixing continually with the unemployed they find that a feeling is growing among men and women that something is radically wrong with a social system that allows such conditions and that the thoughts of the unemployed are running into channels which would not be open in better circumstances: the local communists are aware of these/
theso facts and rejoice at the opportunities which]they present, ;,,.She following extract - tow &amp; speech recently. made by McQuigNan, a oocomunist and a member of thejLiverpool Unemployed Committee, is typical of thoattitude; of many &quot;unemployable&quot;:was offered four days&apos; work tfc-day, but I did not take it.   For that four days&apos; .. , ; .    work I would have received 30/-v   I, by %&amp;kii &quot; that job, would have lost my 16/- dole for this week, and ray dole for nest week, and thai is equivalent to what I would have earned by working.   Also, I would not have been oligiblj for any out-door relief.   Therefore, I did nof take it.&quot; x:jUA series&apos; of organisation oonfererioes was held by the Labour Party i* the North Eastern district during the week-end at whioh considerably attention was devoted to the unemployed question: - Oh September 24th Messrs. Clynes, Henderson and Sidney-Webb addressed a confereaoe of representatil of about 600 labour organisations at Ne;voastle, at which a resolution was passed deploring the present volume of &quot;unemployment and urging tha assembling of Parliament to deal with it. - In Durham and Northumberland $he organise tioiigof the unemployed is in the hands of Ord and Qogaq of O-ateshoad, Lenagh of Sunder land, Wv;eeler and Cameron of Newcastle, i^dermaji Duhlop of South Shields and Cribble of Canada and Newcastle . The Sunderland committee, which has as secretary a ioofiimunist Sinn Reiner, consists of six, 1 communists, one of whom, Bernstein, is theBritish/
mm    Q    wmBritish born son of a Russian Jew and secretary of the local branch of the Communist Party.   George Ord, the chairman of the Gateshead Unemployed Committee, has been twice convicted of larceny and Alderman Duhlop has been fined ana bound over at South Shields for obstruction and for.behaving in a manner whereby a breach of the pea,ce. might have been occasioned.   George Viheeler, who is acting as district organiser., is a violent communist and recently proposed to Linkskill, another British born son of a Russian, Jew and chairman of the local branch of the Communist Perty, that the unemployed should demonstrate at midnight, march to tho house of the Chairman of tho Guardians and, if no satisfaction were forthcoming, leave it to the unemployed &quot;to smash things up&quot;: this proposal was made at a committee meeting and was favourably considered as it was thought that the police would be in their home3 at night.   Thefollowing of this group of communists consists of 300 - 400 habitual loafers and criminally Inclined individuals, but the majority of unemployed has stood aloof since the recent baton charge.My Midlands correspondents report that the Nottingham and Coventry unemployed appear fairly satisfied with the action, of the local authorities but others; particularly in Leicester, are very restive.   A; it at ion in the last named city has been much more pronounced since the arrival of Jennett of Islington and daily demonstrations attended by over 1,OjO are taking place.   Jennett was recently warned by a police inspector whenspeaking/
speaking but wag urf;,cd by the crowd to &quot;K&quot;ep on.&quot; On the morning of September 23rd, about 2,000 unemployed, who were inclined to be rowdy, assembled in the Market Place, Leicester, and marched to the Guardians1 Offices:   a good   deal of feeling was shown when they were informed that, as a temporary measure&quot;, forms for ordinary relief would be ready-that evening and the &quot;Red Flag&quot; was sung.   At 5 p.raV oh the same day about 1,500 again collected outside tho Guardians&apos; Offices and a great uproar arose when they were informed that they could not see the Guardians before September 27th:   trouble was only averted by the tact of the Superintendent of Police..   On September 24th about 1,000 men took advantage of an issue by the Guardians of credit nobes of 5/- each.   My correspondent reports that Leicester unemployed show great restiveness:   the hooligan element is becoming more conspicuous at each meeting and agitators such as Jonnett, Ley and Gregory are continually inciting the unemployed to violence.My Birmingham correspondent reports that the task of the moderate men, who are attempting to counteract the exploitation of the unemployed by extremists is becoming increasingly difficult and that they say that unless relief measures are instituted without delay they will not be responsible for the behaviour of the unemployed. The Lord Mr..yor of Birmingham has entered into negotiations with the Mayors of Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Bristol, Bull, Bradford and py-rcastle and. has suggested a meeting
in London to-day to discuss action in regard to the unemployment question:   this stgp ia the result of; a. decision reacned at a special session of the. Birmingham City Council on september^th^r 32nd -when a deputation of unemployed was received,   It is noteworthy that the deputation consisted, of Wckefield, the organiser- of the Central area, and a member of, the National Administrative Council of Unemployed, the. communist Brain, late Midlands organiser for the Red.. Trade Union International, and Birchley, chairman of the Handsworth Unemployed Committee.   There is dissension among tne unemployed committees in Birmingham owing to the efforts of the communists to oust- the &quot;moderate&quot; members of the Independent..Labour, P.r.rty. .; ,The unemployed in Yorkshire are fairly quiescent at the moment, although there is a good deal of irritation owing to the different methods of the various Boards of Guardians, some of which appear to be granting relief on loan and others without.any stipulation.   The Sheffield and District Council of Unemployed appears to be doing a good.deal of organisation: , this Council, which represents, Sheffield, Attercliffe, Lo-sley Chase, Bolehills, Shiroliffe and V/incobank, ;has; been approached by the Co;;t-amist Party with a view to ^oint action on behalf of the unemployed.   The Council is making arrangements for demonstrations-during the &quot;national week&quot; and/feels &quot;sure same will bo a success if only from the point of view of calling attention once.again to the unemployed problem.&quot; *My/
- 13 -J$ correspondents report that unemployed demons^ations are taking Place almost daily in South Wales, hut that so far the men are being held &apos; in hand by responsible labour leaders:   communists ax*e, hov/ever, working hard to gain control of tho movement and last week Holt, chairman of the London District Council of Unemployed, was organising in the Pontypridd and Ehonada Valley district:   in Dowlais also a small branch of the Communist Party, whioh has Just been formed, is working among the unemployed.   In Bargoed, Morgan Phillips is keeping in touch with Haye and has orderod 400 contribution j cards, 2,000 flags and 240 copies of &quot;Out of Work&quot;.Bristol Channel branches of the National Sailon and Piremen,s union have decided to organise meeting at all ports in the district to bring to the notice of the local govornlng bodies the acute sufferings of soamen duo to unemployment, and to ask them to provide adequate allowances or employment.ky Glasgow correspondent states that the arrest of John Maclean and McDougall was most opportune, as frequent threats of sabotage have been made:-   he adds that the leaders of the hooligan element have considered a suV.gostion th$t attacks should be madeVon the Corporation powor stations;   it was.thought that without power and light the city would be in a state of chaos suitable for the development of unemployed &quot;tactics&quot;.William Benholm, the secretary of the Wishaw branch of the Communist Party, is also secretary of the local unemployment council and writes that the communists &quot;dominate the council which is affiliatedto/

September 24th that, as a result of a meet lag held inBrixton Prison on the previous day:&quot;The imprisoned Aldermen and Councillors and their colleagues reaffirm their determination not to enter into any negotiations or discussion as to future action until the Poplar Borough Council was able to meet as a corporate body as free men and women in their own Council Chamber at Poplar, and that the Joint Committee with Bethnal Green bo urged to adopt the same polioy.&quot;Writing in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; two days later,however, Laasbury, while reiterating, the demand for&quot;Freedom First&quot; said:mfte want to go out of this inferno.   Our days are beins wasted, the morning and energy of our lives, wasted at a time when wo know we ere wanted outside.   We want.you to force Mond to call that conference, and force him to set us at liberty so that we may attend it as free men and women.&quot;The effort to induce other London boroughs tofollow Poplar1s example has beon successful in BethnalGreen:   my correspondent was present at a meeting ofthe Borough Council held on September 22nd,   when thefollowing recommendation of the Finance Committee waspassed by 16 to 10 votes, with one abstention:&quot;That as a protest against the inaction of His Majesty1s Government in regard to the equalisation of London rates and the imprisonment of members of the Poplar Borough Council, rat e s   in respect of the estimated requirements of the London County Council, the Metropolitan Police, the Metropolitan Wr,ter Board, and the Metropolitan, Asylums Board, be not levied for the half year ending the 81st M&quot;.roh next.&apos;&apos;The recommendation was moved by Councillor Gray and supported by Councillor Valentine and Alderman Boyce.Several divisions were taken before the vote was finally decided when Gray and Valentine showed themselves to bedelighted with the result.   The latter subsequentlyproposed that a small committee be set up to take any action necessary in connection with tho rocommendation:the wording of his proposal was intended to give absolutepower/
power and discretion to the committee which he suggested should consist of Gray, Boyce and himself.   considerable objection was raised to his.proposal hut it was subsequently agreed that the committee should merely, deal with matters as *&apos;  they arose,reporting progress from time-to time.   Gray then read a letter from J. J. Vaughan - from Gairloch, in which the mayor wrote that he? wished fully to associate himself with any decision that might be taken in regard to the recommendation&quot;of the Finance Committee.     About 100 of the local unemployed were in the gallery during the proceedings and a large crowd which gathered outside the &quot;&quot;Town Hall greeted the result   of the voting with bursts of cheering. During this weeks-an extraordinary; meeting of Stepney Borough Council will be held to re-consider the question of the rates for the coming half year:    the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; state that the Council will rescind the rate notices that have already been prepared.THE COMMUNIST&quot; AND THE UNEMPLOYED&apos;Since the expiration of the Defence of the realm regulations there has been a change in the tone of &quot;TheCommunist&quot;, the&apos; editors of, which are probably aware that theris difficulty in taking proceedings against the paper.    Thecurrent&apos;issue contains an unsigned article entitled &quot;civil war this Winter:   Black Menace of Unemployment&quot;, which hasbeen submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.   Thefollowing&quot;extracts indicate the trend, of this article:&quot;War this winter.   Not a scare headline, but actual war - in your town, it may be in your street..  Your - unemployed brother, your unemployed husband, yourself in it.   Last.winter there were some conflicts with the polij There was the &apos;battle of Downing Street&apos;, there was the! riot at Islington Town Hall.   Police violence and the   \ beginning of resistance.   Over the summer the tension slackened. , Life, was- easier then, and odd jobs could he picked up.   But this winter must be faced by the unemployed with no fuel and insufficient clothi:og.   The &quot;wretched doles they receive come to an&quot; end as the local Councils go bankrupt, and have either to cut the.doles off or go to gaol.&quot;Starvation)
"Starvation and police brutality will do the rest. The first few conflicts will be mere helpless riots. Then the ex-soldiers will remember they are ex-soldiers, and we shall be flung at once into a new revolutionary crisis, with the unemployed and with them the communists in the front line.

"Great Britain is going the way of the rest of Europe... London is well on the road that dying Vienna has already travelled. And it is up to us to see that London does not fail as Vienna failed, that the London revolts do not end all in failure as the Viennese did - that Londoners are not beaten and exhausted till they are content to die in quiet.



"The unemployed and police have come into violent conflict already. But up to date, this conflict has been undirected. Aimless, useless rioting of starving but unarmed men. Take the case of the Dundee riot.



"After a do-nothing decision by the Parish Council, the unemployed marched to interview Lord Provost Spence. They were received in the usual manner - with an evasive reply and a police baton charge. The unemployed were driven back to the city...



"Wild scenes of this kind have occurred and will occur all over the country. We have no space to refer to the events of Bristol and Sheffield, or to the struggle in the Liverpool Walker Art Gallery. Enough has at least been said to show that we are not exaggerating when we prophesy



CIVIL WAR THIS WINTER.

"The Government cannot treat the unemployed as it did before the war. Then the unemployed were peaceable and helpless, and the soldiers were a class apart. Now the unemployed are ex-soldiers. They know now how to use a rufle.



"What will come out of it? The Revolution? Well, we must not dismiss the possibility too easily. The Russian revolution arose from a squabble in a food queue. A cancelled dinner started the European revolution of 1848. A rumour and an excited man on a chair in a park led to the taking of the Bastille in 1789. Any trifle will do to start it, if the times are ripe.



"But all the same we do not anticipate it this winter. Most of this winter&apos;s battles will be one-sided affairs. The unemployed are not yet armed. They have not yet realised that the Government cares nothing for unarmed men, as she been shown in Ireland where only the I.R.A. awoke Mr. George&apos;s conscience&apos; on the Irish question. This winter the unemployed will be beaten because they will not be able to fight, although they may in certain districts fight enough to gain some crumbs.



"All the same, the duty of the Party is clear. Our position, by which we abide, is stated in the following resolution of the R.T.U.I.:



"... Not with the employers, but against them; not through negotiation, but through the open class war: not with the help of the bourgeois State, but through its destruction and the establishments of the dictatorship/  
- 18 -dictatorship of the proletariat.   Only hy these means will.the unemployed problem be solved.&quot; &quot;The revolutionary unions do not put off the unemployed, with a promise of the final destruction of capitalism.   The unemployed are hungry - we demand bread,   Tho unemployed lack-Clothing and heating - wo insist upon the bourgeois State supplying these, needs., Prices, of all necessaries are rising: - they must&apos;bo lowered. -        -11 ^Relief to the unemployed is only charity -we demand the payment of full wages.   Employers, by shutting down the factories, and by means of systematic short time, increase the mass of unemployed misery: - we demand the opening of the factories, the unemployed to take their places with their fellow-workers,   Against tho proposals of the bourgeois joint,committees for shorter hours with shortened wages, we demand shorter hours without loss of pay...&quot; 1 These demands, it must be remembered, ensure only the barest existence level.   Nevertheless, the bourgeoisie will put up the greatest opposition to them, beoause in this period of the decay of the capitalist system they are no longer in a position to ensure even a bare existenoe to their wage slaves. As soon as this fight for these daily demands Is carried on with sufficient energy (by means of mass demonstrations, eto.) it will out-grow itself and pass into a struggle for the control and maintenance of production over the heads of the employers.   This means a clash with, and the collapse of, the capitalist State power itself; and a struggle for the arming of the proletariat - the expropriation of the factory owners; the establishment of the dictatorship of the prole tarlat *1 &quot;THE COMMUNISTSAlthough the Communist Party has drafted &quot;official&quot; accounts for the Cserphilly election, for submission to\the Returning Officer amounting to  578, tho actual cost of the election was  968&quot;*4*0^4* made up as follows:. *, .

Pox also stated that Tom Quelch, who had an.office in Moscow for over a year, was sent home because the Russians considered the -; communist, movement in England negligible.This information is. borne out by James Clunie, the delegate of the Socialist Labour Party to the Moscow Congress,who writes in the current issue of the &quot;Socialist&quot;:&apos;-&quot;.&apos;..&apos;&quot;&apos;. &quot;It. the Third Congress:-complaint. v/as made thatthe British Csoamunlst Party had failed to take&quot; advantage of the recent miners1 strike and the conditions.it gave rise, to..

When we^tell you, get- to the mosses and you reply that Lloyd George also has a small party, I consider it a most intolerable situation^ &quot;There is little doubt that the membership of the Party Is decreasing:   according to Fox the working classes are opposed to it and &quot;more members are leaving it than new ones Joining.&quot; The funds from legitimate subscriptions must bo practically negligible as branch returns show that a very high percentage of the membership is unemployed and consequently pays no -subscription.George W. Wheeler, a leading Newcastle communist, is more outspoken than some of his colleagues.

to the communist meeting and at once attacked the audience with their fists. Wilson, the divisional organiser, left immediately under an escort, but the chairman, Durrant, stood his ground and was thrown into the Castle pond. We swam to the other side and walked home while the ex-Service men held a meeting on the original pitch.



THE NATIONAL UNION OF POLICE AND PRISON OFFICERS

A noticeable feature in connection with the South London Organised Unemployed is the activity of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers&apos; officials on the local committees. Police strikers have figured as members of deputations received by different councils and Boards of Guardians, and are apparently regarded by the unemployed as an important section of the organisation. These men invariably make a point of creating a feeling of hostility in the crowd towards the uniform police, and shorthand writers who happen to be known to them. They make a feature of the alleged militarism of the Police Force and lead the crowd to believe that the Police are seeking opportunities to crush the organisations by violence. Any persons who openly disagree with the views of the speakers are immediately described as agent-provocateurs sent to the meeting to cause dissension in the ranks of the organisation and in some instances where uniform Police have not been present the interrupters have been hustled from the crowd. Police strikers who are particularly prone to indulge in this conduct are Powell, Councillor Bessell and Dollar.



REDUCTION IN WAGES AND THE COST OF LIVING

There is very great opposition, particularly among engineers, to the prospects of wages being further reduced before the cost of living has been brought down.

Everywhere sound working men are grumbling about the cost of food and beer and there is little doubt that if these could/   
could both be reduced and the quality of the beer improved discontent would be greatly reduced.   Many of the workers are urging that the authorities should take steps to deal with retailers who maintain their prices at a high level, irrespectiv of reductions in the wholesale markets.It appears that the price of beer has been raised in many districts since decontrol and complaints as to the inferior quality are widespread:   the importance of beer to the working classes is not generally understood and the matter is worth attention.LABOUR&apos;S GENERAL. council the second ballot taken by the Trade Union Congress to decide the representation of the various groups on the new General Council has resulted in the election of the following officials:- &quot;Group 1 - Mining and QuarryingB.

Go there any time of day or night.   They can&apos;t touch you for walking on the pavement.   A half brick would do a lot of damage there, and it would take a lot of police to guard suoh a large place, as they would require to be inside and&quot;out.   There are also a number of plate-glass windows along the street there, with plenty of food behind them, gentlemen.   If you are hungry, donlt starve.   Take the food, but take it in a way that they cannot take you. In Russia such ametings as these were fired on by the police from windows.   That would be done here yet and worse.On September 26th, J.V, Leckie, the Glasgow communist, and ; T.J.

I would like to see overy man of the Unemployed join the Defence Corps to-morrow, and if they are members of the Communist Party they will know what to do.

If you are going to be batoned down donft run away and leave your leaders as you did before.   Stand your ground.

Tho situation in Great Britain remains unchanged: Sinn Fein speakers from Ireland are not anxious to appeals: on English platforms at present and applications for speakers have recently been refused owing to the peace negotiations. It is reported from Coventry that in the event of negotiations breaking down, extreme action will be taken immediately by the Irish Republican Army and thsj &quot;Irish Salf-peterminaticn league: a meeting was held recently in Coventry to discuss this possibility.Applications have been made for the use of the Albert Hall for a meeting to commemorate the death of Terence MoSviney on October 25th and plans are also being made for a demonstration in Trafalgar Square.Seen McLoughlin has been addressing meetings in Yorkshire in a somewhat violent strain:    reports of his speeches have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions,There is still dissension among the Sinn Peiners in Glasgow, which centres chiefly round the person of Jack 0&apos;Sheehan.   A fresh demand is being made for money and it is hoped that the sum of  10,000 may be raised.During the year 1920, Sinn Fein Clubs and Irish Self-Determination League branches in England and Wales forwarded to Headquarters in Ireland the sum. of  1,523. 5. 10., and   from the 1st January to 9thSeptember/the special purpose that if you are called upon to fightj do so, hut fight against the present constitution because I will do so.&quot;Wheeler was remanded, bail being refused.On September 28th, Lyle and Holmes, who had failedfo find sureties, appeared before the South WesternPolice Court and were bound over in their own recognizanlof  25 each to be of good behaviour and keep the peacefor 12 months,SIM miS IN CHEAT BRITAIN
- 27 -September, 1921, a farther-sum of  4,277. S. 10.   The last contribution was   00 sent by Sean Survey, Acting-General Secretary to the League, for the Ulster Fund. Tfehy Sinn Fein Clubs in-England remained dormant during 1920, but these have now paid affiliation fees for the past.and current years. &apos;LAJfLThe situation in Ireland has taken a turn- for the worse.   The delay in the Government1s reply has set all sorts of rumours afloat and it is reported that the Irish Republican Army have received orders to complete all arrangements and be ready to take the field again.   A good deal of this may be due to the fact that the extremist leaders believed that there had been a difference of opinion in the Cabinet over the reply to be sent to de Valera.   They think that there will be a breach In the English camp and that it may be necessary to take advantage of this.The Irish Ropubliean Army headquarters are perturbed at what they consider to be increased activity amongst the Government Forces snd there Is a general feeling of uncertainty and a fear that the Irish-&apos; Republican Army may be caught in a trap asleep.   The position is such that- any untoward event might set the whole business well alight again.   The Binn Fein Courts are functioning quite openly in the south and v/est and the Irish Republican Police are busy in most places.Labour trouble is still very acute and the leaders are promising great things for their followers when the Republic comes into being.   The Labour situation must be regarded as serious, although it Is true that they have not any funds to speak of and are not too well organised.   The real trial of strength between Labourand/
and the Dail is yet to come.The French Government has decided not to * countenance the mooting in Paris of tho Congress of the Irish Nation which was to be called on the 21st January by the Irish Self-Determination League, on the ground that political refugees must not abuse their asylum in France by making it a base of activity against an Allied Government.
THE Lord Chancellor very much hopes that will find time to read the accompanying document, which deals with a subject of great and pressing importance.Having regard to the fact that we are threatened with a debate upon the subject in the House of Lords, the Lord Chancellor would be obliged if the document be kept confidential till after the debate.[6815]
