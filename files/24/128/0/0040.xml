Officers at the naval school at Trobizond have also been warned for duty, and are proceeding to the Crimea and to Odessa via Batum.Italian, relations with the Kernalist3r.   Coasting steamors arriving at Smyrna from Anatolian ports are loaded with goods shipped away to avoid the 40/ duty recently levied by the Keawflists. The Italians, being installed at these ports, are accordingly suffering losses.     British cloth merchants at Smyrna are also involved, as they have considerable stocks at Adalia.The Italians are much incensed, and are increasing their troops at Scala Nuova and maintaining naval forces at Adalia.GREBOS.The Greek Navy has carried out a re-sweep of Smyrna Bay with negative results.The ex-Army transport &quot;Great Northern&quot; of 8,255 tons gross,- has lately been taken over by the Navy Department, and will become Fleet Flagship of the Atlantic Fleet.  .The Battleship &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, the former Fleet Blagship, has been transferred to the Pacific Fleet.

2144.PART   II.GENERAL   INTELLIGENCE-AFGHANISTAN oThe Afghans continue to refuse to fully disclose officially the secret clauses of their treaty with the Soviet Government.   They have given verbal assurances that the terms are identical with those already privately revealed.This refusal however has resulted in the abandoning of the- special treaty between Great Britain and Afghanistan and a treaty of neighbourly relations only will now be put forward.The Afghnn attitude at present is friendly to the British representative,PERSIA.  -The Persian Prime Minister now appears to be entirely swayed by the Soviet Minister to Persia,, whose anti-3ritish activities are becoming increasingly apparent.The appointment of Sir Percy Loraine to be the British Minister at Teheran in succession to Mr, Norman has been announoodeBALTIC STATES.Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were admitted as members of the League of.Nations on 22nd September 1921.GERMANY.It is thought that there maybe considerable-changes&apos; in the political position shortlyc   A broader coalition of the moderate forces would appear to be imminent.D2NQARY,The Conference of Ambassadors has presented an ultimatEjm to the Hungarian Government to the effect that the Burgehland must be evacuated by 4th October0   Coercive measures to be adopted in case of norr-compliance are nob defined.M, Benes, the Gzecho-Slovak Foreiggn Minister, has offered to mediate on the following lines i-   Hungarians to traacuato the Burgenland, but Austria, to cede Oedenburg to Hungary.This solution appears acceptable to both parties.POLAND.The relations between the Polish and Soviet Governments are very strained.     No progress has been made in the Vilna question.
5.TURKEY,.     n    British BaefflfiHLjft m^sawusss^-   Thf Briton High Qcannlssioiier, Coratantijnople./ has &quot;been eroporered to negotiate on an Ball-for-allu basis, and, if neoessary, to agree to forego the trial of tho 0 Turkish prisoners accused of cruelty to British prisoners of war.     There are now 59 Turkish prisoners at Malta,     General Harington proposes to name 7th October as the day for the exchange to be effected.Refugees.   The first batch of refugees landed at Varna are still there.   A second batch sent to Bourgas wore refused permission to land there, and are being sent to Varna. These refugees appear to have some rifles and are further rumoured to have some machine guns.The Amerioan High Commissioner has asked for funds to oontinue feeding 17,000 Russians daily after 1st Ootober, on whioh date tho American Red Cross funds are exhausted.Greek Operations.Greek H.Q. admit their failure, and had not anticipated such losses or such resistanoe.   The Grook troops fought well, in spite of their heavy losses, but Staff work failod, and the arrangements in rea? of an army were not understood.   The Kemalists have swung the pendulum in no uncertain manner, and are now pressing the Groeks hard.The retreat has been well conducted so far, and will probably be completed in safety, but ccmrflunications went to pieces and confusion at H.Q. was caused by Turkish raid on Sivri Hissar,     The Greeks are destroying the railways rail by rail, and burning villages as they go.   It may be expebted that they will reach their Eskishehr lines without serious molestation and that a stalemate will ensue in about a fortnight.The calling up of the 1922 class is expected to yield 40,000 men, who should be ready to take the field in 3 - 4 months time.Kemal is believed to have decreed a general mob ills a-tion in Anatolia.BULGARIA.Reliable information indicates the presence of a Kemal is t organisation in Bulgaria whioh aims at fomenting raids on ffihraoe and so preventing the departure of Greek reinforcements to Asia Minor,RED   SEA.The British military guard at Salif is to be withdrawn.
CHINA,A Ohdtoo^Gorman agreement was ratified on 1st July, and takes effect as from that date.   It provides for the re-establishment of normal, diplomatic and commercial relations, but it does not claim for the nationals of Germany any extraterritorial privileges.     So long as the agreement is in foroo, lawsuits affooting German citizens ih China will be tried in the newly established Chinese courts in accordance with the new laws.   Genjjans are granted tho right to travel, reside and engage in business only at plaoes in China where the citizens of a third power have similar rights.   The agrooment is intended to form the basis of a formal treaty to be negotiated later.
