This man has been the cause of many casualties to Crown Forces, and Was released In order to attend the meetings of Bail Sireann. The- use to which he is putting his present freedom is only another instance of the impossibility of placing reliance on any rebel to observe the terms of the agreement,&apos;Irish Republican police are rapidly arrogating to themselves all the functions of tho D.M.P. and R.I.C, &quot;and the height of 1m-pudenco was rcachod when, a few days age, they kidnapped two Military policemen who had gone to arrest a deserter&quot;, stating that they had themselves arrested the man on another charge.I forwarded a Memorandum to you on 29/8/21 dealing with the general Question of breaches of the truoe and suggest that if the Governments offer for a conference is accepted by Mr. Be Valerano time should be lost before bringing forward this question of the truoe and placing It.upon a satisfactory and simple basis. I suggest a conference between the Secretary of State for War, Mr. Michael Collins and myself with a representative of the Irish Office, might find a satisfactory solution.I would quote the following-:,from An T*0glad of sept. 2nd.-&quot;Jjven if war were averted the nation would always require that rtsafeguard of its national existence provided by the grog of the &quot;Irish Republic, and it is impossible at tho present time to for* &quot;see any set of circumstances in which the maintenance of its &quot;highest strength of the Army of Ireland would not be a matter &quot;of vital odnoern to the nation&quot;.And again on sept. 9th .-&quot;The period of suspended hostilities which we have passed through has not been a period of inaction. The work of training and organisation is being carried on with all the vigour at our&quot;disposal, and, should the necessity arise immediately for a fresh oampalgn, the benefit of this improved training should be made manifest in action.....*We have made war to endthellS IJOCIJMEHT IS THE PROPEKTY OP HIS KIMAJHHIO MAJESTY^ GOW;NMEHT) i
the military occupation of our country hy a foreign nation, and until that nation evacuates our country the War cannot he regarded as endede   The atmosphere of 1 truce&apos; is an unroal atmosphere calculated to obscure the naked realities of the situation&quot;.In Belfast, sectarian riots continue. These are not on a large scale and have not been beyond the power of the troops to copo with, but owing to the use of bombs by the rioters, it is impossible to prevent casualties amongst the civilian population;.The Civil Government have now requested that the Officer Commanding the troops in Belfast shall tako over full control of tha Police and Special Constabulary and orders have been issued to that offset*(Sd)0 OcMJiaoroady.General j Commanding-in-Chief., Ireland.G*H,Q., Ireland^87th   September, 1921 a
