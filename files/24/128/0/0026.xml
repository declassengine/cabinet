DE VALERA*S REPLY DATED SEPTEMBER 19th, ; 1921   TO TOT^aiME MINISTER;s^ETTlR&quot;OP SEPTEMBER. 18th IM.(Reference   -   Pager Mo^CP.3320) *Dublin.Mansion House. September 19th 19S1.The Right Honourable D* Lloyd George, Gairloch,Sootland.Sir 4We have had no thought at any time of asking you to accept any conditions precedent to a conference.   We would have thought it as unreasonable to expect you as a preliminary to recognise the Irish Republic, formally or informally, as that you should expect us i formally or informally, to surrender our national position. It is precisely because neither side accepts the position of the other that there is a dispute at all, and that a conference is necessary to search for and to discuss such adjustments as might compose it.A treaty of accommodation and association properly concluded between the peoples of these two islands ^nd between Ireland and the group of States in the British Commonwealth would, we believe, end the dispute for ever, and enable the two nations to settle down in peace, each pursuing its own individual development and contrl-buting its own ouota fo0 civilisation, but working together in free and friendly cooperation in affairs of agreed common concern.&apos;^ To negotiate such a treaty the respective representatives of the vtwonations.,..
105nations must meet.     If you seek to impose preliminary oon-d-itions whioh we must rogard as involving a surrender of our whole position, they cannot meet.Your last telegram makes it clear that misunderstandings are more likely to increase than to diminish, and the cause of peace more likely to he retarded than advanced hy a continuance of the present correspondence.   We request you, therefore, to state whether your letter of September 7th is intended to be a demand for a surrender on our part or an invitation to a oon-reference free on both sides, and without prejudice should agree-ment not be reached.     If the latter, we readily confirm our acceptance of the invitation, and our appointed delegates will meet your Government*s representatives at any time in the immediate future that you designate.I am, Sir,Yours faithfully,(Signed) EAMOU DE YAItBBA., Whitehall Gardens. S.W. September 31st. 1921,
