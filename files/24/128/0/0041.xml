&amp;(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 217Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1921. 3*SECRET.CP.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.The Foreign Office have circulated a Despatch from Sir E. Rumbold (E. 10261/1/44) dated 2nd September. This document shows fresh evidence of the disastrous consequences which are entailed by the fact that Great Britain is not represented at Angora. Our Boreign Office can conceive of nothing but official representation, and as official representation is impossible, our enemies and our allies can influence Angora, whereas we alone are prevented from doing anything which might make the position easier between us and Mustapha Kemal. I have often made representations to my colleagues and the Foreign Office on this subject.E. S. M.26th September 1921.4664     100   9.21
