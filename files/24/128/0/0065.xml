[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]&quot;      333Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1921.SECEET.C P.-3366.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF  IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 3rd instant.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.While the country as a whole continues undisturbed and peaceful it cannot be said that the atmosphere in which the truce is being maintained is so favourable as at the beginning. Drilling by the I.R.A. is undoubtedly being carried on to a much greater extent than was possible before the cessation of&apos;hostilities, and although the drilling parties are usually unarmed and do not conduct their operations in the public streets or otherwise in a deliberately provocative manner, there is a growing feeling among all ranks of the Crown Forces that drilling of any kind is a violation of the truce and should be suppressed. The commandeering of unoccupied houses for use as I.R.A. barracks is unquestionably a breach of&apos;the express agreement that there should be &quot;no interference with. Government or private property,&quot; and the usurpation of Police functions in regard to ordinary civilian crime is clearly in direct conflict with the undertaking given &quot;to discountenance and prevent any action likely to cause disturbance of the peace which might necessitate military interference.&quot; The resentment naturally felt by responsible Police Officers at the steady encroachment which is being made upon their authority under cover of the truce may perhaps incline them to take an exaggerated view of the gravity of the situation, but their reports make disquieting reading, and I am satisfied that the time has now come to require from Sinn Fein a more strict observance of its under- -takings, especially in regard to the non-interference with property and the abstention from acts (e.g., the assumption of Police functions) likely to cause disturbance of the peace. Strong representations as to the need for this improvement have been made to the chief Sinn Fein Liaison Officer, and, as stated in my survey of last week, a complete recasting of the liaison machinery for dealing with alleged breaches of the truce is under consideration.- Three deplorable incidents occurred during the week which are the subject of serious charges and countercharges by the participants on both sides, and pending completion of the investigations which are being made, the facts must be regarded as still in. dispute. The first incident was a conflict between a Constable and a -civilian in Limerick City on the 26th ultimo in which the Constable was dangerously wounded. It is alleged that the civilian fired in self-defence, but a full enquiry into the matter is being held over until the Constable is sufficiently recovered to give evidence. The second incident was a shooting affray between two Police and a party of civilians in Tipperary on the night of the 28th&quot; ultimo, resulting in one civilian being killed and two wounded (one a girl of 19). One of the two Policemen was stabbed in the back with a knife. Two Military Police, who took no active part in the affair, were wounded, whether by the Police or civilian fire is not known. Both sides alleged that the other started firing without provocation, and by arrangement with the chief Sinn FeinLiaison Officer in Dublin, a joint enquiry was conducted by a Senior Police Officer on the staff of the Chief of Police and a member of Dail Eireann on behalf of Sinn Fein. Unfortunately, the two invesfi-gators were unable to agree upon the question of the credibility of the evidence produced, and they were therefore unable to come to an agreed conclusion. The case is still under official enquiry. The third incident was a fracas which arose outside the Town Hall, Galway, on the night of the 2nd instant, while a dance in aid of the Republican Dependent Fund was being held within the Town Hall. An outbreak of firing took place and a Lieutenant of the 17th Lancers who was passing in a motor car was &quot;mortally wounded, and a temporary Constable attached to the Auxiliary Division was also dangerously wounded. A Military Court of Enquiry is being held.  The Sinn Feiners refuse to give evidence.[7037]
Situation in Belfast.Party feeling in Belfast continued to run dangerously high throughout the week, but no rioting-on a considerable scale occurred. A number of serious assaults on individuals of both sides took place, and occasional isolated acts of revolver firing, but the precautions taken by the Military and Police Authorities proved sufficient to prevent such incidents developing into a general disturbance. On the 28th ultimo a body of about 200 Unionists returning from the funeral of one of the Protestant victims of the riots were fired upon and four men were wounded, one mortally. Three other men (all Unionists) were wounded by rifle or revolver fire during the week. On the 1st instant a crowd numbering about 1,000 assembled in a Unionist quarter and attempted to wreck a fruit shop belonging to a Roman Catholic family, but were dispersed by a baton charge of the Police. An assistant in the shop, a girl of 20 years of age, was stabbed by a hat-pin in the back and seriously injured. Several other attacks upon Catholic shops and spirit groceries were quelled by Military or Police intervention.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Two trials of civilians by Court-Martial were concluded during the week, the charge in both cases being that of attempting to escape from an internment camp. Sentence of one year&apos;s imprisonment with hard labour was imposed on conviction in both cases.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 1st instant       ,Total orders made ... ... ... ...      4,353Orders cancelled for reasons other than release        231 Releases ordered ... ... ... ...        460-        691Number of persons now interned    ... ... ...      3,662The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 29. &apos; -State of the Police Forces.

The general stoppage of traffic on the Great Southern and Western system, which resulted from the strike of the locomotive staff on the night of the 26th ultimo, continued, with the exception of restricted services on certain Southern branches, until the morning of the 1st instant, when the full normal service was resumed. At a Conference held at the Dublin Mansion House on the preceding evening (the 30th ultimo) between representatives of the company and of the shopmen concerned by the wage-reduction dispute, the following agreement was come to : (1.) The Great Southern and Western Railway Company are prepared to accept the decision of Lord Justice 0&apos;Connor on his recent arbitration subject to the following conditions : In the case of.coalmen, the reduction shall be put into force from the date fixed in clause 1 of the arbitration award referred to.(2.) Subject to ratification by the men concerned, it is agreed that all shopmen shall resume work at the earliest possible opportunity.(3.) The company agrees that when the shopmen resume duty all notices issued shall be withdrawn, and work shall be resumed by all grades at fhe earliest possible moment.The arbitration award of Lord Justice 0&apos;Connor referred to in the above agree-ment provided (1) that the reduction of shopmen&apos;s wages by 6s. per week should take effect from the 18th September, 1921, and (2) that the principle of district rates of pay should not apply for the present. , The arbitrator took the view that the reduction proposed was reasonable and that the companies would be compelled to run at a loss if existing rates of wages were maintained. In regard to the question of district rates of pay he suggested that a Conference should be called about next February to examine, grade by grade, the proposed application of this principle, and that, failing agreement, the points in dispute should.be settled by arbitration.Mr. de Valera&apos;s unqualified acceptance of the Prime Ministers renewed invitation to a Conference to ascertain &quot; how the association of Ireland with the community of nations, known as the British Empire, may best be reconciled with Irish national aspirations,&quot; has lifted a great load of anxiety off the minds of the Irish public. It is recognised that the way to a final settlement is still beset with many difficulties which will require the exercise of forbearance and the quality of&quot; sympathetic understanding on both sides to surmount.The work of the Conference may well be interrupted and possibly jeopardised if the truce is not better observed by Sinn Fein. The boycott of Ulster and also of certain British imports continues. There are two Police Forces in many places in Ireland the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Sinn Fein Police. There is obvious danger in this state of things. The Secretary of State for War has circulated to the Cabinet a Memorandum from the Commander-in-chief of the Army in Ireland setting out the terms necessary for a real and defined truce. The acceptance of this, with possible additions or amendments, is a matter of urgent necessity to avoid the possibility of conflicts that might shatter the best hopes of the Conference.Present Political Situation in Ireland.H.
