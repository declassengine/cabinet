THIS DOCOMBJM IS THE PROPERTY. 01? HIS BRITAHEIC MAJESTIES GOYERlffiENT).IpST SECRET. ,C A B I H B I..P.-3363.UIMiOPLOYI^IlQJ. ^Proposals of Commander Hilton Young *s Ooramittee submitted to the Prime&quot;&quot;Minister at Gairloch. OotoEer 2nd, 19SI.1.     The fundamental causes of unemployment are of a world-wide character, namely (a) impoverishment and dislocation of the means of production consequent directly or indirectly upon the war, (b) the impediments in the way of new enterprise caused by political and economic instability.   In so far as tho remedy for these depends upon action in the international sphere we have not attempted to deal with them. 3.    The most important immediate influence in Sreai Britain is the relatively high cost of production caused mainly by the higher rategof wageso3.    There is no short out for avoiding the necessary process of adjusting costs to those of our competitors.   Readjustment however may he expedited by more wide spread tinder standing of the economic situation, and it is of fundamental importance that no scheme of relief should hinder this process. 4.     It is inevitable that during this process of readjust-ment a proportion of unemployed must be supported by doles or relief.5.    Effort, however, should be concentrated in keeping as. many workers as possible engaged in their normal industries by the encouragement of fresh orders.6.    This cannot be done by any general extension of credit facilities but we think that means may be found by whioh State assistance could enable works, to.be undertaken whioh otherwise would not be done at the present time. Suoh assistance wouldgive
give by its initiative an impulse towards industrial revival. If and so far as the successful working of the scheme is impeded by the high cost of production it will serve as a useful illustration of the immediate causes of unemployment.

Our proposals for this are as follows:-

7. A Committee consisting of a small number (say five) of representatives of industry, labour and finance should be established with authority to assist, within the limits of the financial powers conferred upon them, (1) the promotion at home of capital works (including undertakings ancillary or incidental thereto) that will be of ultimate benefit to the nation and will provide employment, such works to be undertaken by local authorities, public utility companies or private enterprises; (2) the placing of orders in this market from the British Empire and foreign countries for works of a similar nature. In the case of foreign countries the scheme could be worked in conjunction with the Ter Moulon project. In all cases such assistance would, when desirable, take the form of a guarantee.



8. The Committee shall be instructed to reject any scheme when in their opinion the cost of production either as a whole or in any detail is unreasonably high.



9. The Committee should satisfy themselves in every case that there are adequate reasons which justify State assistance and that the scheme cannot reasonably be financed by private enterprise.



10. In the case of all applications and especially those of private concerns assistance shall only be granted by the Committee upon terms which they are satisfied will ultimately secure adequate benefit to the public.



                                                                             To....
