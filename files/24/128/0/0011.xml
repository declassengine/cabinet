IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY&apos;OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.)C A B I N E TNFIDENTIAL *----- j ^ ELAND .P.5511cCopy of Telegram from the Prime Minister to Mr.de Valera dated September 15th. 1921,-Sir,I informed your emissaries who came to me here on Tuesday, the 13th, that the reiteration of your claim to negotiate with His Majesty^ Government as the representa-tives of an independent and sovereign State would make conference between us impossible.     They brought me a letter from you in which you specifically reaffirm that claim, stating that your nation &quot;has formally declared its independence and recognises itself as a sovereign state&quot;and &quot;it is only,&quot; you added, &quot;as the representatives of that State,and as its chosen guardians fiat we have any authority or powers to act on behalf of our people.&quot; I asked them to warn you of the very serioxis effects of such a paragraph, and I offered to regard the letter as undelivered * to me in order that ^ou might have time to reconsider it.Despite this intimation, you have now published theletter in its original form.     I must accordingly cancel the arrangements for conference next week at Inverness, andmust consult my colleagues on the course of action which this new situation necessitates.     I will communicate this toasyou as soon as possible, but/l am for the moment laid ixp here a few days1 delay is inevitable.   -Meanwhile, I must make it absolutely clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot reconsider the position which I have stated to you.   If we accepted conference with your delegates on a formal statement of the claim which you have reaffirmed, it vrould constitute an official recognition
by- His majesty s. Government of trie severance..-of -Ireland &apos; from the Empire and of Its existence as an independent Republic.   It would, moreover, /entitle you to-declare as of right acknowledged by us that in preference to association with the British Empire you would pur-sue a closer association by treaty with some ether foreign Power.   There Is only one answer possible to such a claim as that.The great concessions which His Majesty&apos;s Government have made to the feeling of your people in order to secure a lasting settlement deserved, in my opinion, some more generous response, but, so far, every advance has been made by us.-&apos;On your part you have not come to meet us by a single step, but have merely reiterated in phrases of emphatic challenge the letter and the spirit of your original claim.I am,Yours faithfully,(Sgd.)&apos; .B.LLOYD GEORGE..2, Tibltehall Gardens, S.W* September 16th. 1921,-2-
