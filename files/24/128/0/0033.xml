JjV /v Week ending the 20th September, 1921.Prepared by Intelligence Division, Ministry of Labour.Contents.page general- Survey of the Week     ...      ...   117Features of the Week...........   118PAGENegotiations and Disputes ...      ...   120Statistical Appendix        ...      ...      ...   124GENERAL   SURVEY   OF   THE   WEEK.The more notable events of the week under review have been concerned with the administrative activities of the State with regard to conditions of labour rather than with conflicts between employers and employed on questions of hours or wages. The unem-ployment position has been the centre of greatest discussion and the remedial measures proposed by the Government are being subjected to hostile criticism by the national labour bodies. - The Portsmouth magistrates in virtually refusing to enforce, in the cases before them, the payment of statutory minimum rates fixed by a Trade Board and confirmed by the Minister, voiced the criticism which some groups of employers have for many months been passing upon the working of the machinery of the. Trade Boards Acts. A conference of associations, representing clerical and professional workers&apos;, have questioned the administration of the Industrial Courts Act, and demanded legislation on the lines of the Factory Acts to improve the conditions of work in offices.The close of the^present month will, however, be a time of much activity in wages and hours negotiations. In the shipbuilding and engineering industries, active negotiations are beginning on the subject of the 12J per cent, and 1\ per cent, bonuses, while the Scottish railway companies are proposing both reductions in wages and a revision of hours. The Co-operative Wholesale Society, who incurred a net trading loss in the tirst six months of the year of  3,484,600, will enforcers from 26th September a.further wages reduction of 10 per cent. Further developments are also expected next week in the current negotiations in the printing, and. soap and candle trades. The termination on the 30th inst. of the subsidy in aid of coal miners&apos; wages, together with the change-over from the temporary to the permanent scheme, may also occasion a position of considerable delicacy in the coal min-ing industry.The estimated total of the Live Register of all Employment Exchanges on the 16th September was 1,479,700, as compared with 1,502,600 the corresponding figure.for the -previous week.(34691-31) Wt.78  300  9/21  H.

FEATURES  OF  THE  WEEK.General Topics.Unemployment. The Cabinet Committee on Unemployment again met on 16th September to consider schemes for relief work and approved the following proposals for assisting public authorities, which it is hoped will enable them to proceed with useful public work, calculated to provide a large amount of employment at the present time, which would otherwise not be carried out until a later date : (1) Where for the purpose of providing employment in the present emergency local authorities (including statutory bodies who do not trade for profit) put in hand or accelerate approved works (other than revenue producing works) which would not otherwise have been proceeded with, or so accelerated, at the present time, the State will give financial assistance on the following basis : Grants equal to 50 per cent, of the interest and sinking fund charges on loans raised by local authorities to meet expenditure on schemes actively commenced before 1st January, 1922, will be paid by the State for a period of one half the term of the loans subject to a maximum of 15 years. The expenditure to be taken into account will be all approved expenditure incurred within the period ending 31st March, 1923.In approving schemes special regard will be had to the direct employment of unemployed persons and to a preference being given to ex-service men.(2) In the case of the revenue p oducing works grants will be paid, in approved cases, equivalent to 50 per cent, of the interest on loans, raised for a period of not less than 10 years, in respect of expenditure on schemes actively commenced before 1st January, 1922, provided that such expenditure is incurred within the period ending 31st March, 1923. These interest; grants will be paid for a period of 5 years.The Unemployment Grants Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord St. Davids will continue for the time being to deal with schemes submitted to it.These proposals had been explained and discussed at a meeting held on 15th September, presided over by Sir Alfred Mond, of representatives of local authorities throughout Great Britain.A circular was issued on 15th September, by the Ministry of Health to local authorities concerning economy in public expenditure. In a previous circular issued on 15th February 1921, it was urged that no fresh capital expenditure should be undertaken which could be postponed without material risk to the public health. It is now stated that this recommendation has been modified and the Minister of Health is prepared to consider favourably applications fox sanction to loans for necessary work giving a relatively large amount of employment, provided that such work be carried out on recognised economic lines and with no undue extravagance through the employment of uneconomic labour.At a meeting of Labour Mayors of the London Boroughs, held on 14th September, it was decided that they should visit the Prime Minister at Gairloch for the purpose of discussing the unemployment problem and relief measures. They were referred to the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment and a meeting was arranged for 17th September, at which the Minister of Health outlined the proposals of the Committee. These were held to be inadequate, and the London Labour Mayors accordingly went to Inverness on- 18th September. An interview with the Prime Minister has been arranged for 22nd September.The . Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress met on the 10th September to consider the whole problem of unemployment. A sub-committee, consisting of Messrs. Poulton and Swales and Miss Bondfield, was appointed to work with the Labour Party. . This sub-committee was authorised to proceed with arrangements for demonstrations to enforce the demands put forward^ at the recent annual meeting of the Congress, that Parliament should be summoned immediately and that practical schemes of work should be introduced and necessary financial aid should be given.Demonstrations of unemployed men and deputations to Boards of Guardians are reported from all parts of the country, but during the past week there have been no serious breaches of&quot; the peace. The demand that Parliament shall be summoned immediately has been made at many of the unemployed demonstrations and by many of the municipal authorities.Trade Boards Acts. Summonses brought by the Ministry of Labour against certain drapery firms were heard at Portsmouth on the 13th September, when Messrs. J. D. Morant, Ltd., and other local drapers were charged with infringements of the Trade Boards Acts. The offences alleged were the non-payment of the minimum rate of wages fixed by the Dressmaking and Women&apos;s Light Clothing Trade Board and the failure of the firms concerned to post up in their workrooms notices which set out the rates of wages.   The Magistrates imposed fines of 10s. for the failures to post up the Trade Board
31644notices, but dismissed, under the Probation of Offenders Act, the charges of failure to pay the prescribed rates of wages. The reasons for the latter decision* were given as follows : &quot; The bench were not satisfied that any reasonable or proper inquiry was made as to whether those prosecutions were necessary or desirable, having regard to the conditions of trade prevailing in Portsmouth. Further, it had been admitted that the informations were laid in cases where the employees were not only perfectly satisfied with the terms and conditions of their employment, but had actually petitioned the Ministry of Labour to leave them alone. It had not been suggested that anything in the nature of sweating or other objectionable practices for which legislation was required existed in these cases, and the bench could not help regretting that the Ministry of Labour should have thought it fit to lay the informations which were before the Court in view of all the admissions that had been made. In the circumstances the bench had no hesitation in dismissing all the informations under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907.&quot;   -The present constitution of Trade Boards was considered at the annual general meeting of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Retail Garment Makers&apos; and Milliners&apos; Association. The Association objected to the undue representation of &quot; professional trade unionists&quot; and also to the method of nominating appointed members.The Association of British Chambers of Commerce has recently circularised its members with a view to obtaining their opinions on the working of the Trade Boards.The Minister of Labour, in addressing a meeting at the Grocers&apos; Exhibition on the 19th September, replied to recent criticisms of the Trade Board system and stated that a Committee, with Lord Cave.as Chairman, is to be set up to examine the Trade Boards Acts and to suggest modifications and improvements.industrial Organisations.The National Federation of&quot; Professional Technical and Supervisory Workers. This Federation held a Conference at Caxton Hall, Westminster, on 17th October. Proceedings were divided into two sessions both of which were presided over by Mr. G. Latham of the Railway Clerks Association.   ,The morning meeting comprised representatives of societies already affiliated to the Federation, and considered methods of promoting closer relations amongst associations of non-manual workers. A Standing Joint Committee to consider the basis of affiliation to the Federation was constituted as follows : Messrs. Fred Hughes (N.Q. Clerks), S. Wimhurst (Guild of Insurance Officials), J. Gibson (Scottish Bankers Association), S. Juleff (Shipping Guild), C. H. Sykes (Stock Exchange Guild), J. Hart (Railway Clerks Association) and C. Band (National Union of Law Clerks).The afternoon meeting was an open conference, and a number of unaffiliated Associa-tions sent representatives. It discussed the form of a questionnaire to be presented to members of, and candidates for, Parliament by means of which it is hoped to obtain support for the legislative programme of the Federation. During the discussion a letter was read from Mr. W. Graham M.P. in which he questioned the legality of the decision of the Minister of Labour in refusing to appoint, at the request of the insurance officials union, a Court of Enquiry under the Industrial Courts Act to report upon the strike of 143 employees of the. General Accident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporation, which occurred in November last year.The conditions of work in city offices received much attention and it was considered that in many cases these were below the standard laid down for factories by the Factory and Workshop Acts.The questionnaire in its final form was adopted as follows : 1. Do you agree that non-manual (professional, technical, clerical, administrative and supervisory) workers are entitled to organise in trade unions for the protection and advance-ment of their interests ?2. Are you prepared to advocate, in Parliament or elsewhere, that the protective associations representing such workers should be recognised by employers, private or public, as the negotiating mediums on all matters appertaining to the conditions of their employ -ment ?3. Are yon prepared to resist any attempt to prevent pr hinder non-manual workers organising in their protective associations, and to oppose any form of intimidation or victimisation of those so organised ?* Since these cases were heard a similar case has been taken at Bridport and a Bermondsey employer has appealed against conviction for paying wages below the Trade Board Rate. In both cases a decision was given in favour of the Ministry of Labour.
24.9.2 L ^ 120Features of the Week continued.4. Are you prepared to support or introduce, if necessary, an amendment to the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, that will make it obligatory for a public inquiry to be held provided that no conciliation machinery (such as an industrial court) exists, or where such negotiating machinery had been unsuccessful in effecting a settlement-when one or both parties involved in a trade dispute ps defined by the Act make application for such inquiry ?5. Will you assist in promoting legislation for offices to be kept up to the standard of modern requirements with regard to ventilation, air space, cleanliness, and sanitary convenience ?National Pottery JVorkers1 Society. The Annual Delegate Meeting of this Society was held at Derby on l?th September under the presidency of Mr. W. Aucock, who will continue in office during the coming year.The Secretary&apos;s report dealt at length with the financial position of the Society and illustrated to a remarkable degree the disastrous effect of disputes in the mining industry upon other workers. During the miners&apos; strike in October, 1920, the Society paid  4,000 in unemployment benefit, and during the dispute commencing in April of this year  56,000. In order to repay a debt of  10,000 incurred during the last of these j)eriods a weekly levy, has been imposed upon members of the Association.It was reported that the work of the Joint Industrial Council had been hampered by the. long periods of unemployment, and that the Executive Council of the Society had. decided, partly owing to the difficulty of obtaining repayments from the Ministry of Labour, to discontinue the payment of State unemployment benefit.The Society interests itself very keenly in the problem of occupational diseases. A meeting with the employers to discuss silicosis or &quot; potter&apos;s asthma &quot; was reported, and a prominent feature of the Delegate Meeting was a speech on- industrial diseases affecting the pottery industry, made by Dr. F. Shufflebotham, medical adviser to the Society. He said that pottery was one of the most unhealthy industries so far as the workpeople were concerned, and emphasised the need for strenuous preventive measures. He strongly advocated the inclusion of silicosis in -the schedule of industrial diseases attached to the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.Trades Union Congress. A meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress was held on 15th September. Arrangements were made for the issue of ballot papers to affiliated trade unions, returnable by 22nd September, for the election of the General Council, and a sub-committee was appointed to give effect to the resolution on unemployment passed by the Trades Union Congress at Cardiff.Tewtile Workers International Congress. The International Textile Workers Feder-ation opened its first congress since June 1914, in Paris on 19th September. Representa-tives were present from England, France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Holland and Denmark, but the United States, Austria and Hungary were unable to send delegates and no reply to the invitation was received from Russia.The Congress decided that Mr. Tom Shaw should continue as International Secretary and that the Headquarters should remain in England. The work of the Federation will be extended to cover the collection of information and statistics relating to various aspects, of the textile industry.A commission has been appointed to consider and report to the Congress on the length of the working week, and a resolution was passed granting subventions from the International strike fund to the textile workers on strike in France and Belgium against a reduction in wages.The Congress will continue in Session until 24th September.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Soa.p Workers (National). At a meeting of the&apos; Soap -and Candle Trades Joint Industrial Council in London on the loth instant, the employers put forward definite proposals for wages reductions and the trade union side, after consultation with a delegate conference, rejected the proposals and requested that the dispute should be referred to the Industrial Court for arbitration. The employers refused to accede to this request. The situation is now being reported to the workpeople in the various districts by their representatives, and a delegate conference is arranged on the 25th instant for consideration of the position.The employers! proposal was for a reduction of 4s. for men and 2s. for women, to be put into force in two halves, on the 1st October and 1st December.   It was also

The Co-operative Wholesale Society have determined to put into force, as from&quot; the 26th September,* the second half of the wages reduction of 10 per cent, in accordance with their revised proposals of the 17th August. The first half of the reduction was put into force on the 22nd August without serious opposition. The proposal of the unions concerned that the question of reductions should be referred to arbitration has been declined.Strikes and Lockouts.Boilermakers (Barrow). A strike of 1,200 boilermakers at Messrs. Vickers&apos; naval construction works at Barrow began on the 15th instant as a protest against the employment of a member of the Boilermakers&apos; Society who was in arrears with his union subscriptions. The member in question has promised to clear off his arrears, but it is pointed out that he must apply for re-instatement, a process involving some passage of time. A large number of platers, riveters, caulkers, sheet-iron workers, angle-iron smiths, and labourers are involved in the stoppage of work.Railway Shopmen [Ireland). The imposition of a wages reduction of 6s. per weekf upon railway shopmen, members of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, has resulted in a strike by the men, which affects the Great Southern and Western, the Midland and Great Western and the Dublin and South Eastern Railways. Members of the union employed in the Dublin railway yards have also struck. Few of the members of the National Union of Railway men are involved.Settlements and Agreements.Building Trade Operatives (Cornwall). The strike of building trade operatives in Penzance, Oamborne, Redruth,,Fahnouth, Truro andLaunceston, against wages reductions proposed by the employers, has terminated,.following a joint conference on the loth inst. between the Cornwall County Building and Allied Trades Employers&apos; Association and representatives of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. Definite rates, with a cost of living sliding scale on the lines of that contained in the National Agreement, have been agreed upon and the difference between the wages of craftsmen and labourers has been fixed at 4i. per hour, provided that on reduction the rate of wages of labourers shall not be less than 75 per cent, of the craftsmen&apos;s rate.Iron Miners (West Cumberland). A ballot of the workers on the terms proposed by the masters has resulted in the acceptance of wages rates of 10s. Sd. per day for miners, 10s. &apos;5d. for craftsmen, and 7s. for labourers.. These rates represent a reduction of nearly 50 per cent, on the wages paid twelve months ago. The mines will be re-opened after having been idle since the beginning of the year.Leadminers (Wanlockhead, Lanarkshire). As the result of a conference between the Wanlockhead Mining Company, Ltd., and representatives of their employees, with an official of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; County Union, the strike of miners which began at the Wanlockhead lead mine on 28th January % is now ended. The Company&apos;s offer of  2 per week has been accepted by the men concerned.The offer by the Leadhills Mining Co., Ltd., however, stated to average 30s. per week, has been rejected by their employees and the strike at their mines therefore continues. ^Boilermakers (Mersey). The strike of boilermakers against the decision by the Mersey Shiprepairers&apos; Federation to rescind a local rule requiring the employment of 25 men upon an oxy-acetylene burner has been ended by an agreement to resume work, where possible, pending a conference between the parties on the 26th inst. The union concerned is the Boilermakers&apos; Society.
Shipyard Joiners (National). The current issue of the monthly journal of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers contains an address to members explaining and justifying the decision of the executive council of the Union to terminate the shipyard joiners strike.*It is stated in the course of the address that at a conference on the 30th June the Federation of Shipbuilding Employers offered that &quot; during apprenticeship each lad should be supplied with tools by his employer ; and on completion of apprenticeship, a full kit of joiners&apos; tools should be signed over to each lad and become his property.&quot; This is regarded as &quot; a valuable concession which may help to settle in the future the vexed question of tool allowances.&quot;Cotton Operatives (Oldham). -The threatened stoppage of cardroom workers employed by the Anchor Spinning Mill Co., mentioned in last week&apos;s Report, has been avoided by the withdrawal of the notices tendered by the Oldham Card and Blowing Room Association. This action of the union is attributed to the vigorous attitude adopted on the matter by the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations.Tramwaymen (Salford). The strike of tramway workers employed by the Salford Corporation (mentioned in last week&apos;s Report), terminated on the 17th instant as the result of joint conferences arranged by the Mayor of Salford between the disputants. The following points were agreed upon : (1) That the preBent dispute be terminated immediately without prejudice. (2) That the present Negotiating Committee of 12 shall at once proceed to consider the whole question with a view to arriving at a satisfactory settlement.(3) That the Inspectors shall resume payment of contributions to the Union as aud from 23rd September, 1921.(4) That failing the arrival at satisfactory conclusions by the Committee, the question as to whether or not the Inspectors shall remain outside the Union shall be submitted to arbitration.Coal Miners (National). A meeting of the National Board, constituted under the settlement of the 1st July which terminated the recent coal dispute, will be held on the 29th instant. In preparation for it the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation will meet on the 28th, and it appears that meetings of district boards and of district miners&apos; conferences will also be held before the national meetings of the 28th and 29th, It will be &quot; remerhbered that the &quot;temporary period&quot; under the settlement ends on the 30th September, and that the &quot;permanent scheme &quot; will operate as from the 1st October, at least in the districts in which there has been a break in the continuity of monthly reductions in wages. In those districts where the so-called economic wages have not yet been reached, the &quot; temporary period,&quot; in so far as the sacrifice by the owners of aggregate net profits is concerned, may apparently extend until the 31st October. The meetings of next week will have to deal principally with the change over from the &quot; temporary period&quot; to the &quot; permanent scheme.&quot; The National Board has still to fix the &quot; periods of ascertainment&quot; under the latter scheme. The making of an &quot; ascertainment&quot; is a lengthy proceeding and it does not seem probable that the wages actually to be paid in the various coal mining districts as from 1st October, will be known until some days after that date.The results of the district ascertainments for the month of July, which determined the wages payable during September, were made known about the 14th instant. &quot;In ac-accordance with the provisions of the temporary settlement, the changes in wages to operate as from the 1st September are expressed in terms of flat rate increases or decreases. In the &quot; settlement district&quot; which covers the statutory districts of Yorkshire, Nottingham-shire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Cannock Chase, and Warwickshire, the men received a flat rate increase of S^d. per day as compared with their wages. during August. In the Scottish district there was no change. In the settlement district which includes Lancashire, North Staffordshire and Cheshire, there was a reduction of 2d. per shift as compared with August. In. the other districts, the most important of which are Northumberland, Durham and South Wales, die maximum reduction of 6d. per shift was necessary. It is stated that in South Wales, the reduction as from the 1st October may be as much as a further Is. or 2s. per shift.Steps have been taken in the last two months to set up the District Boards provided, for in the settlement of the 1 st July. So far as can be ascertained the usual form of constitution is that the Board consists of equal numbers of miners&apos; and owners&apos; representatives who appoint a President and Vice-President chosen from the two sides to conduct the ordinary sessions of the Board.   The independent Chairman appear s to be* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 9, 27th August, 1921, p. 91.
regarded as a referee to whom recourse will be had only when the Board in ordinary session fails to agree. In Northumberland the County Court Judge for the Newcastle circuit is to appoint the independent Chairman ; in Scotland, the Lord President of the Court of Session. In Cumberland, failing acceptance by Sir W. J. Collins, the Lord Chief Justice will be asked to nominate the independent Chairman, while it is proposed to ask Sir William Plender, the independent Chairman of the National Board, to nominate the independent Chairman for the District Board for Durham.The first duty of the National Board upon its institution, was to consider and deter -mine the definitions to be adopted, in making the periodical ascertainments, for such terms as &quot;proceeds,&quot; &quot;wages,&quot; and &quot;costs.&quot; Upon the,interpretation of these terms naturally depends the detailed working of the settlement. The procedure followed was for the National Board to lay down rough terms of definition ; for these to be then considered in detail by the accountants to the respective sides. The accountants reported differences of opinion to the National Board at two meetings on the 28th July and 9th August, and after this double consideration by the accountants and the National Board, the points of dispute left over were submitted to the independent Chairman, Sir William Plender, who issued his final award upon the points in dispute on the 12th August. The folio wing-details illustrate the kind of points that were raised and the general lines upon which the terms to be defined have been settled : (1) General Basis. The industry (of which the.proceeds, standard wages and costs of production other than wages, determine the wages payable in addition to standard wages) is the Coal Industry.(a) &quot; Other activities &quot; as, for example, the running of coke ovens and by-product plant, the manufacture of patent fuel and the conduct of selling agencies and merchanting depots, &apos; are to be excluded from the ascertainments.(&amp;) &quot; Mixed collieries,&quot; that is, where coal is only raised incidentally to other minerals ..   for the purpose of working the mine or of treating the minerals, are also to be excluded, though the terms of settlement may govern the wages of workers therein.(c) Collieries temporarily closed will be included in the periodical ascertainments, the independent Chairman deciding against the miners&apos; contention that collieries &quot; suspended through industrial disputes or from questions of policy &quot; should be excluded.(2) &quot; The proceeds of the Industry in a district.&quot; The proceeds are to include the net pit-head value of sales of coal to outsiders or transfers of coal to excluded departments, and also of other products as for example, water, ironstone and clay. Transferred coal will be calculated. at market value and adjustments will be made for any difference in the values of coal on hand at the beginning and at the end of the period of ascertainment.(3) &quot; Cost of Standard Wages&quot; Here the owners wished to extoud the definition while the miners wished to restrict it. It will be remembered that the owners are allowed standard profits ejuivalent to 17 per cent, of the cost of standard wages. The independent Cnairman&apos;s ruling was that the following four items should be excluded from this calculation : (a) The wages or salaries of all clerical and administrative staffs.(b) Wages charged as part of capital expenditure.(c) The value of privileges in the form of coal or houses free or at reduced rates.(4) &quot;Costs of production other than wages.&quot;-The following items among others will be included as costs :-- *(a) Allowances to provide a subsistence wage to low paid day wage workers, as determined by the District Boards.(b) Wages and salaries of all clerical and administrative staffs.&apos;(c) The Id. per ton welfare levy under the Mining Industry Act, 1920.(d) The value of the consumption of timber and stores/excluding materials consumed on account of capital expenditure. Stocks of timber and stores will be valued at proper intervals.(e) Such depreciation charges as are allowed for incpme tax purposes.The following items among others will be excluded : (a) Income tax, corporation profits tax and super tax.(b) Charitable subscriptions even where allowed for income tax purposes.(c) Interest charges on fixed loans, bank overdrafts, etc.(d) Amortisation of capital expenditure over and above income tax depreciation.The following provision with regard to the remuneration of owner managers to be included in the costs of production is of general importance : &quot; The amount so to be included would not necessarily be remuneration actually charged ; it should represent the fair remuneration which would be payable in the district for the work done or services rendered as measured by the facts and circumstances in comparable cases where officials have no interest in the ownership of the colliery.&quot;(5) &quot;Accountants&apos;&apos; Test Audits.&quot;-In. cases where the Accountants to the sides of a District Board fail to agree, the question will be submitted for decision to the independent Chairman of the District Board, who will refer any question of general principle to the independent Chairman of the National Board.(6) &quot; 20 Per Gent. Guaranteed Minimum Addition to Standard Wages.&quot; The owners&apos; accountants drew attention to the apparent failure of the terms of settlement to provide for the recovery of sums, said to make up the guaranteed minimum jaddition, from other periods in which the proceeds warranted rates of wages higher than the minimum. The miners stated that the intention of the terms of settlement were against this claim. The Chairman ruled that the terms did not provide for wages representing this minimum addition being included in any deficiency to be carried forward.5,
STATISTICAL  APPENDIX.;Employment Exchanges.The Unemployment Position. On the 9th September, in the United Kingdom 1,545,281 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,240,424 were lodged by males and 304,857 by females.
