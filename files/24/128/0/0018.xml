(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET . CP.3319.CABINET. IRELAND . MR DE VALERA&apos;S REPLY DATED SEPTEMBER 17 th 1921i7th. i92i7 :(Reference - Paper No.CP. 3318.)Dublin.Mansion House.September 17th.1921.The Right Honourable D.Lloyd George, Sir,In reply to yourlast telegram Just received, I have only to say that we have already accepted your Invitation in the exact words which you re-quote from your letter of the 7th inst.   We have not asked yon to abandon any principle, even informally, but surely you must understand that we can only recognise ourselves for what we are.   If this self-recognition be made a reason for the cancellation of the Conference, we regret it, but it seems inconsistent.I have already had conferences with you, and in these conferences and in my written communications I have never ceased to recognise myself for what I was and am.   If this involves recognition on your part, then you have already recognised us.   Had it been our desire to add to the solid substance of Ireland&apos;s right the veneer of the technicalities of international usage which you now introduoe we might have claimed already the advantage of all these consequences which you fear would flow from the reception of our delegates now. Believe me, we have but one object at heart - the setting of
the Conference on such a basis of truth and reality as would make it possible-to-secure-through it the res\ilt which the people of these two Islands so ardently desire.I am, Sir,Yours faithfullyj(Signed) EAMONW DE VALERAI2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. September 19th.1921.-2-
