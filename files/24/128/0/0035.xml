[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majest^slydvemment.]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1921.SECEET.CP.-3336.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Segretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 19th September.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.I am glad to note that the Police Reports for the week indicate that there has been a marked improvement in the observance of the truce conditions on the part of Sinn Fein, although this is in flat contradiction to other reports including one from General Tudor, in reference to the six counties. The breaches alleged in the Police Reports were few in number, and, with two exceptions, comparatively unimportant. The exceptions were the illegal arrest of two civilians for trial by Sinn Fein Courts, one of the persons arrested being a Nationalist farmer of Bantry District, co. Cork, who had disobeyed a summons to attend as a witness before a Sinn Fein Court, and the other an ex-soldier charged with assaulting Sinn Fein policemen. The latter, who is believed to have Sinn Fein sympathies, has since been liberated.With the exception of Belfast, the country has been generally peaceful, but one incident of a somewhat sensational character occurred near Cookstown, co.. Tyrone, on the 15th instant, when a body of the I.R.A. who had been drilling in the neighbourhood came into collision with an armed party.of Ulster Volunteers. An exchange of shots resulted in one member of the I.R.A. party being wounded, and twenty-five were taken0 prisoners, but after being deprived of their arms were released uninjured. Eight loaded revolvers which were found in their possession were retained by the Ulster Volunteer Force.The boycott of English and Ulster goods continues to be maintained in spite of the truce and three acts of violence committed in pursuance of this policy were reported during the week. On the 14th instant a number of men entered the Goods Store attached to Tralee Railway Station and forcibly removed seven casks of jam consigned by two well-known London companies to a local firm, and on the 15th instant a quantity of boots of English manufacture were taken from Sligo Railway Station and thrown away. A similar outrage in connection with the Ulster boycott was perpetrated in Dundalk on the 16th instant, eleven barrels of lubricating oil consigned from Belfast being wantonly destroyed.As a result of strong&quot;&apos; representations made to the Chief Sinn Fein Liaison Officer for the Martial Law Area the two Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary who were kidnapped at Bandon on the 9th instant were released on the 15th instant and returned safely to Barracks on the same day.Further disturbances in Belfast. .     *A further outbreak of party rioting occurred in Belfast about mid-day on the 15th instant and continued intermittently throughout&apos; the following three days. The origin of the outbreak appears to have been the exchange of provocative words between two fortuitous gatherings of opposing partisans in Vere Street, a &quot; mixed &quot; locality, and the affair developed with such suddenness that firearms were in use before the Police were aware of its occurrence. Sniping was freely indulged in by both sides and in the course of the four days&apos; rioting resulted in two deaths (the victims being women aged 22 and 23 respectively), and six cases of serious wounding. The areas principally affected by the outbreak were those of Vere Street, Grove [69761
Street, York Street, North Queen Street and Ballymacarrett. A number of arrests of persons belonging to both parties were made- by the Police and Military, and one of the persons arrested will be charged with the murder of the two women.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Three trials of civilians by Court-Martial were concluded during the week resulting in two convictions and one acquittal. Both the convictions were for the possession of arms and ammunition, and sentences of three years&apos; penal servitude and of two years&apos; imprisonment with hard labour, respectively, were imposed.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 17th instant. 1 -Total orders made .. ... ... ...      4,245Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       220 Eeleases ordered ... ... ... ...       429-        649Number of persons now interned   ... ... ...      3,596The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 31.   &apos;State of the Police Forces.

Irish Railways Labour Dispute.Another serious labour crisis on the Irish railways has been precipitated by the sudden strike of the railway shopmen on the three principal southern lines. The subject of the dispute is a proposed wage reduction of 6s. per week, which has already been accepted by similar grades of English railwaymen. As the men affected include the coalmen in the locomotive yards their action has already caused a con-siderable dislocation of the railway services radiating from Dublin to the south and west, and if persisted in must result in an almost total stoppage of that traffic within a few days. The Irish Transport Workers&apos; Union, to which the men belong, has given its support to the strike in spite of the opposition of the two important railway unions concerned, the Irish Engineering union and the Amalgamated Engineering Union. A proposal put forward on behalf of the companies that the men should resume work forthwith and submit the question of the reasonableness of the reduction to arbitration within a week has been rejected by the men, but negotia-tions are still proceeding.Notwithstanding the severe disappointment caused by the cancelling of the Inverness Conference the optimism of the Irish public as to the eventual successful issue of the peace negotiations does not appear to have been seriously shaken. Mr. de Valera&apos;s formal insistence on independence is generally regarded in Ireland as an unavoidable if somewhat embarrassing condition imposed upon him by the circum-stances of his position, and his latest letter pointing out that this claim involves no demand for its recognition by the British Government is thought to have made the way clear for a renewal of the Prime Ministers invitation. This view has been pressed strongly and with remarkable unanimity by the Nationalist press of the whole country, and it is the general opinion that if the present difficulties in regard to the holding of a Conference can be surmounted, the further progress of the negotiations towards a satisfactory settlement is not likely to be impeded by the assertion on the part of Sinn Fein of abstract principles of national independence which go beyond the attainable ideal of full self-government within the British Empire.In my opinion, the truce is being used by a certain section of Sinn Fein leaders to drill, equip and recruit the Irish Republican Army. In some parts of Ireland drilling and machine-gun, rifle, and revolver practice is all but openly carried on.Generally, the authority of the Irish and British Governments is declining during the period of the truce because the Sinn Feiners break it in certain places without penalty or risk of penalty, and the Crown Forces perforce must stand idly bywill be a clash, probably first in Ulster.It is absolutely essential that the terms of the truce be at once clearly set out in writing. The truce is now a verbal understanding between the General Officer Commanding and Mr. De Valera.If a conference with Sinn Fein representatives takes place, this question of a defined truce should be settled, or there will be the danger of outbreaks during the actual conference.Present Political Situation in Ireland.H.
