^   NOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN UNITED KINGDOM ONSEPTEMBER 30, 1921.1. The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent. The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unemployment figures, was 4-7 per cent.  It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.Throughout 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent.in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year. ^ The figures for 1920 are :-To the end of  2-9January   ... ... ---         ---                             ^ gFebruary ... ---March      .... --- ---                              q.qApril       ... --- 1-1May     ... ... ---      ---             ;;;    x.2June        ... ... ---                                         1-4July        ... .. --         -         * -          *&apos;      !.6August     ... ...  - -  .-.         ---                             2-9September ... ...         ---         -&quot;                  5.3October    ... ... ---         &quot;&apos;                  3.7November ... ...         ---         &quot;&apos;                  g.QDecemberThe figures for 1921 are :.-To the end of  g.9January   ... ... &apos;*&apos;      g-5February ... ---         ---                            iq.qMarch      ... ... ---                                        17.5April       ... ... - -         -&apos;-                     &quot;&apos;    22-2May        ... ... ---         -                     &apos;*&apos;    231June        ... ... ---         v                           16-7July ;      ... ... ---         -                            16-5August2.

I.-STEPS PREVIOUSLY TAKEN TO DEAL WITH UNEMPLOYMENT.(A.) Emergency Works.At the meeting of the Cabinet held on the 13th August, 1920, a special Sub-Committee was appointed to consider the whole question of unemployment and devise means for relieving it. As a result of their deliberations it was announced that the sum of  10,400,000 should be set aside for expenditure on arterial roads, half to be expended by way of actual grant, and half by way of loans to the Local Authorities undertaking the work. In December it was announced that a further sum of  3,000,000 had been allocated to the Unemployment Grants Committee, which is presided over by Lord St. Davids, for the purpose of assisting Local Authorities to carry out works on which a substantial amount of the unemployed could be engaged. Further, it was agreed that the Ministry of Health should accelerate the work of laying out roads and sewers in connection with, approved housing schemes. Arrangements were also made for the provision of alternative work in Government Establishments, and for short-time working in certain Government Establishments. In addition, certain&apos;emergency work was undertaken by Local Authorities without assistance. Approximately  25,000,000 has been spent on the schemes outlined above, and at least 200,000 men have from time to time been provided with work by these means.Summary showing the Labour Employed on above Schemes on September 23, 1921.Scheme.Number Employed 1 Number Employed in Greater London. .     in Provinces.Total.1.

Unemployment Insurance.As a permanent means of dealing with unemployment, the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, became law on the 9th August, 1920, and came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. This Act extended the provisions of the earlier Act to a further 8,000,000 workers. The conditions for the receipt of benefit were the same. A special provision was inserted under which an insured contributor might draw eight weeks&apos; benefit as soon as four contributions had been paid. In view of the prevailing unemployment an amending Act was passed on the 23rd December, 1920, which made provision for the payment of benefit to unemployed workers who proved certain periods of insurable employment. A further Act became law on the 3rd March, 1921, increasing the rates of benefit to  1 for men and 16s. for women. This Act also provided that anybody who proved employment in an insurable occupation in each of twenty weeks since the 31st December, 1919, might receive sixteen weeks&apos; benefit in each of two Special Periods, the first running from the 3rd March, 1921, to the 2nd November, 1921, and the second from the 3rd November, 1921, to the 2nd[7024] * B 2
July, 1922. Power was also taken to borrow up to  10,000,000. A further Act became law on the 1st July, 1921, under which the.rates of benefit reverted to 15s. for men and 12s. for women as from the 30th June, while the rates of contributions were raised as from the 4th July to Is. 3d for men and Is. Id. for women. This Act also increased the borrowing power to  20,000,000, and further gave power to the Minister to extend the period for which benefit might be drawn in each of the Special Periods by six weeks, making twenty-two weeks in each of the Special Periods. The right to contract out of the Act by Special Schemes for industries was suspended during the period of deficiency.Under the Acts of 1920 and 1921 approximately  46  million has been paid as benefit during the period the 8th November, 1920, to the 24th September, 4921. The number of persons in receipt of benefit on the 1st July was 2,060,212, and on the 16th September the number was 1,219,000.II. FURTHER PROVISION FOR UNEMPLOYMENT.Before rising for the recess, the Cabinet agreed that the position with regard to unemployment was so serious that the Cabinet Unemployment Committee must devote special attention to it, with special reference to the exhaustion of benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.On the 19th August, 1921, the Cabinet, on the recommendation of the Committee, agreed that assistance could be given to Local Poor Law Authorities, either by way of expediting the sanction for loans or permitting the loans to be spread over a number of years, in cases in which the Local Authority could prove that there were exceptional circumstances due to the abnormal unemployment and that they were exercising their powers with due care and discretion.The whole matter was again discussed at the Cabinet which met at Inverness on the 7th September.On the 16th September the Cabinet Committee further agreed that &quot; (1.) Where, for the purpose of providing employment in the present emergency, Local Authorities (including statutory bodies who do not trade for profit) put in hand or accelerate approved works (other than revenue-producing works), which would not otherwise have been proceeded with, or so accelerated at the present time, the State will give financial assistance on the following basis.&quot; Grants equal to 50 per cent, of the interest and sinking fund charges on loans raised by Local Authorities to meet expenditure on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January, 1922, will be paid by the State for a period of one-half the term of the loans subject to a maximum of fifteen years. The expenditure to be taken into account will be all approved expenditure incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923.&quot; In approving schemes, special regard will be had to the direct employment of unemployed persons and to a preference being given to ex-Service men.&quot; (2.) In the case of revenue-producing works, grants will be paid, in approved, cases, equivalent to 50 per cent, of the interest on loans, raised for a period of not less than ten years, in respect of expenditure on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January, 1922, provided that such expenditure is. incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923. These interest grants will&apos;be paid for a period of five years.&quot;PROGRESS ON THE ABOVE DECISIONS.Between the 16th September, 1921, and the 28th September sanction has been granted to six Boards of Guardians for loans for periods of two years, and loans have been offered to two others. Applications have been received from one other Board for a loan for a period of three years, current over-drafts have been sanctioned in thirty cases, while applications from five other Unions are under consideration.Eight schemes have been sanctioned by the Ministry of Health for road work, site work, sewage and other work, involving a total expenditure of  536,717, on which it is estimated that 2,500 workmen will be engaged.
III. PRESENT POSITION.The unemployment situation throughout the Kingdom is still serious, and at the moment there are few signs of any immediate prospects of trade revival.   &apos;The number of men unemployed in the coal-mining industry shows a tendency to increase each week, largely on account of the difficulty of disposing of the coal1      &quot; Liu-Hill.-  -.

Some slight improvement has been recorded in the iron and steel industry, and a consequent slight improvement in iron ore mining. Shipbuilding and marine engineering is in a very depressed condition, and no new work has been commenced. The textile industry, so far as cotton is concerned, continues very depressed, though the outlook is stated to be more hopeful. There are, however, signs of a slight revival in the woollen industry. In general engineering the amount of unemploy-ment is increasing, further discharges taking place each week. On the other hand, there are signs of a slight improvement in the boot and shoe industry and amongst garment workers.Below is a table showing the number of persons on the Live Register whose claims are current and the number of persons who have exhausted benefit up to date, for the United Kingdom and for the London area on the 23rd September.
