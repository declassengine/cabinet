October 1921.2mSECRET.CP. 3374.CABINET.DATL  EIREANN.Recent Speeches of Extremist Members.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I CIRCULATE, for the information of the Cabinet, the following extracts from recent speeches of extremist members of the Dail Eireann, together with extracts from the issues of the 2nd and 9th ultimo of &quot; An T&apos;Oglac,&quot; the official organ of the Irish Volunteers.H. G.Irish Office, October 6, 192.1. &apos;Extract from the Issue of &quot;An TOglac &quot; of September 2, 1921.Even if war were averted the nation would always require that safeguard of its national existence provided by the Army of the Irish Republic, and it is impossible at the present time to foresee any set of circumstances in which the maintenance of its highest strength of the Army of Ireland would not be a matter of vital concern to the nation. : -Extract from the Issue of &quot; An TOglac &quot; of September 9, 1921.The period of suspended hostilities which we have passed through has not been a period of inaction. The work of training and organisation is being carried on with all the vigour at our disposal, and, should the necessity arise immediately for a fresh campaign, the benefit of this improved training should be made manifest inaction.....   We have made war to end the military occupation of our country by a foreign nation, and until that nation evacuates Our country the war cannot be regarded as.ended. The atmosphere of &quot;truce&quot; is an unreal atmosphere, calculated to obscure the naked realities of the situation.Extracts from the Speeches made by Members of Dail Eireann on Sunday,September 25, 1921.Dr. Ferran, T.D., speaking at Enniscone, said that it was the mission ,of Dail Eireann to see that the victory for liberty which had been won on the hillsides and by the burning roof-trees should not be bartered away in the Council Chamber.....Were they to swear allegiance to another country it would involve the forswearing of the oath they had taken in the Session of Dail Eireann on the 16th August. They had no intention of allowing any other party to assume their responsibilities.Mr. P. J. Ruttledge, T.D., said that if England resumed her aggression they would defend themselves to the last man in the last trench. The people who said they should accept Dominion Home Rule were not the people who had lined the fences or who had had their homes burned down.[7043]
Mr. A. M&apos;Cabe, T.D., said the Irish position was impregnable. They had dug themselves into that position, and it would take more than the army of an Empire to dig them out of it. As far as their representatives in Dail Eireann were concerned, there was no going back from the position they had taken up when they sent the letter to Mr. Lloyd George claiming independence for Ireland.Mr. E. Blythe, T.D., addressing his constituents at Clones, the Very Rev. Dr. G. M&apos;Meel, P.R, presiding, said they would not accept any settlement that would cause a surrender of their principles or rights.Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s offer might be a manoeuvre or an attempt to bring about a split in the party to which he (Mr. Blythe) belonged. Such&apos; an attempt would be foredoomed to failure.It was up to Mr. Lloyd George to have peace or war. He urged them to support&apos; their own Courts and to continue the Belfast boycott. The present was a good time to have it more rigorously enforced. They should support the Dail&apos;s scheme for the closing of the workhouses.Commandant T. M&apos;Guire, T.D., chairman, Ballinrobe D.C., said that if England tried again to impose her will on the people and the I.R.A. were called upon to man the guns, they would respond to the call.Dr. M&apos;Cartan, T.D., speaking on Sunday at a big demonstration at Ballynowlart (Offaly), said the British Government, according to a Cabinet Minister, were disappointed because the Irish people did not accept Dominion Home Rule; but Churchill and Lloyd George took care that they would not offer Dominion Home Rule. Even if they did, Ireland was a separate nation and a Republic, and Dominion or any other offers did not concern them.They only asked what was their own, and they meant to have it.Mr. P. J. Moloney, T.D., speaking on Sunday at Solohead, said that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s offer was not at all up to General Smuts&apos;s interpretation of it, but, in any case, what was good enough for South Africa was not necessarily good enough for Ireland. Having declared for a Republic and set up their Government, it was their duty to give allegiance to that Government only. It was quite on the cards that they might have to go back to real hard work again.Mr. Sean Milroy, T.D., speaking at Glenealy, said that England&apos;s diplomacy was not going to compel a national surrender. In asking Ireland to surrender her sovereign statehood they were asking more than they could ever surrender. If they surrendered her claim the whole fight of 800 years would he surrendered. If that was the only condition to peace, England would get all the war she wanted.When Dean M&apos;Guinness (Australia), a native of Cloonacool, Tubbercurry, was entertained at a banquet iat Tubbercurry and presented with a silver-mounted shillelagh by the officers and men of the 6th Battalion, Sligo Brigade, I.R.A., Mr. A. MacCaba, T.D., said he hoped that Dean M&apos;Guinness would tell the Australian people that Ireland sought more than the status of Australia, and aspired to something more glorious and dignified than that of a British colony.Mr. Frank Walsh, on his arrival in New York, declared that Ireland would never yield unless granted full independence. &quot; Mr. Lloyd George is the world&apos;s greatest politician, but he is playing a game of death when he tried English politics on Ireland.&quot;.N
