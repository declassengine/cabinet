&apos; ti / / -[This Document is the Property o  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1921.SECRET.CABINET.Note by the Secretary of State for India.For the reasons given in the attached memorandum I am asking the Cabinet to sanction, at the cost of Imperial revenues, an increase from 1,0151. per annum to 1,200L per annum in the pay of Major-Generals Sir C. J. Melliss and Sir W. T. Delamain, Indian Army, who were captured at Kut, from 30th June 1916 to the end of November 1918 while prisoners of war.I am naturally extremely reluctant to trouble the Cabinet on such a small matter, but after a controversy extending over five years, I have been unable to obtain the consent of the Secretary of State for War, and I feel that by the War Office decision such undeniable and grave injustice has been done to these two officers, for the safeguarding. of whose interests I am responsible, that I cannot let the matter rest.My Council and I would be only too glad to pay the amount, which is in all under 1,000Z., from Indian revenues, but I am advised that under statute I cannot do so without the consent of both Houses of Parliament. Obviously, the objections to moving a resolution in the House on a matter of this kind are overwhelming.E. S. M.SOnd September 1021. 6th October 1921._____________Memorandum.Before the war there was no provision in. Indian regulations regarding the pay of Indian Army officers taken prisoners of war.In 1915 certain rules were drawn up by the India Office which were intended to be based on the practice of the War Office, but proceeded on the mistaken assumption that the War Office treated officer prisoners as if they were on leave.With the fall of Kut the matter became of importance, and it was obvious that the India Office rules needed amendment, both on the merits of the question and to conform more nearly to the War Office rules.Broadly speaking, under the latter full pay, with the exception of certain allowances for special duties (e.g., command pay or Adjutants pay), was allowed to regimental officers, while Colonels and General Officers had a special scale, the effect of which in the two most typical cases is shown below: Full pay Per-Pay while prisoner.     and allowances.    centage.     Divisional Commander      -      &quot;) ii50 per annum. 1,774 65Sub-Major General -      -)SuScolonr01^6- -      -)   800 per annum. 1,219 62The War Office admitted the need for the revision of the India Office rules in the case of Indian Army regimental officers, and these were given, after two months on full pay, &quot;pay and half staff pay,&quot; which on an average represented between 85 per cent, and 90 per cent, of their full, pay. 4643      100   9.21
But the War Office refused to allow any amendment of the obviously unsatisfactory India Office rules in the case of General Officers beyond admitting that these should not get less than an Indian Army Lieut.-0olonel commanding a regiment who under the revision got 1,0151. per annum, which was more than the 1915 rules allowed an Indian Army Major-General commanding a Brigade (1,0001. per annum for eight months as though on leave, and then 7001. per annum as though unemployed).The effect of this objection of the War Office has been to give Major-Generals Sir C. J. Melliss and Sir W. T. Delamain, commanding Brigades, the following pay while prisoners (after the first two months on full pay): Full pay. Pay received. Percentage.     1,943 per annum. 1,015 per annum. 52(Average sterling equivalent over whole period.) Thus, not only have they drawn the same pay as Regimental Commanding Officers serving under them (which is obviously absurd), but an entirely inadequate proportion of their full pay.The India Office has pressed for 1,200&apos;L per annum, which it has regarded as the absolute minimum which it was possible to give. This would be 62 per cent, of full pay. If these officers were treated, under the same rules as Indian Army regimental officers, and drew &quot;pay and half staff pay,&quot; they would.get 1,636L per annum.The War Office main objection to the India Office proposal has been that Indian Army officers cannot expect to get any higher rate of pay than is laid down for corresponding British Service officers, except in so far as they can claim, it under existing regulations of their owii.But. the need for revision of the improvised rules framed under a misapprehension early in the war has been admitted in the case of regimental officers ; and there can be no reason for refusing in the case of General Officers.A minor objection raised has been that in the British Service Major-Geuerals do not command brigades and that, therefore, Major-Generals Melliss and Delamain should be treated only as Brigade Commanders and their substantive rank ignored. This would be unfair, since Indian regu-lations did not provide for the command of brigades by Major-Generals ; even if this were not so, the pay proposed (1,200Z. per annum) would only be 6S per cent, of the full pay which they would have drawn if substantive Colonels in command of brigades.The increase to 1,200L per annum which is proposed would remedy with no undue generosity the obvious injustice of paying a Major-General in command of a brigade at the same rate as a Lieutenant-Colonel commanding a regiment serving under him.India Office.
