The Present Situation.MY &quot; Memorandum on the World&apos;s Monetary Problems&quot; (in this paper referred to as &quot; the first Memorandum&quot;), which was published by the League of Nations for the International Einancial Conference held at Brussels in 1920, was completed in June of the same year, and consequently refers to monetary conditions in the earlier part of 1920. Since that time, much has occurred which makes further observations on the subject necessary. New experience has been accumulated, furnishing material by which the earlier analysis can be tested; and in some important respects conditions have altered so essentially that a new situation has to be taken into account in drawing general conclusions^ and particularly in framing practical recommendations.In the beginning of 1920 inflation was still going on in most countries; the general level of wholesale prices reached its maximum for England, Erance and the United States in the spring months, for Sweden in the summer, for Norway and Denmark only towards the end of the year. It was natural, under such circum-stances, that a discussion of the monetary situation should concentrate on the process of inflation, the evils accompanying this process and the measures required to stop it. The aspect of the problem has now been radically changed. During the year May 1920 to May 1921. a fall of prices has taken place, perhaps more violent than any other in the economic history of the world. This fall is still going on, and, although it seems to have been retarded during the last few months, the definite end of the movement is not yet in sight.The downward movement of prices has not, as is sometimes assumed, been merely a spontaneous result of forces beyond our control. It is essentially the result of a policy deliberately framed with a view to bringing down prices and giving a higher value to the monetary unit. This policy of deflation has its root in the popular idea that pre-war price-levels are still to be regarded as &quot;normal,&quot; and that stable economic conditions can be attained only by bringing prices down to the old levels. . In most countries, in spite of the enormous fall of prices that has already taken place, we are still far from this end, and there is consequently plenty of room for a continued policy of deflation on such grounds.A prolonged fall of prices must necessarily have an extremely disturbing effect on production and trade, and it is this consequence of a policy of deflation which has manifested itself most clearly during the last twelve months.A year ago, the productive capacity of the world was fairly well occupied, and labour, on the whole, found fairly sufficient employment. In this respect, conditions are now, as everybody knows, very different. The world&apos;s work has been brought to a standstill to a degree that we have never witnessed before, and unemployment has risen to alarming figures, particularly in countries where the policy of deflation has been applied most severely.It is only natural that our attention should now be directed primarily to the situation created by this development, and that a critical examination of trie whole policy of deflation should occupy the foreground in any discussion of the monetary problem at the present time. It is, indeed, of the highest importance that the aims of. this policy should be reconsidered, and that the effects of it, as far as they have shown themselves hitherto, should be brought into the clearest light.* Professor CassePs first memorandum is printed at- page 34 of volume V of the Proceedings of the International Financial Conference at Brussels (1920).[7025] B
The lead in the general movement towards lower price-levels was taken in March 1920, by Japan, where inflation, as measured by wholesale prices, had reached the figure of 320r In June, this index had already been brought down below 250. In May, a corresponding movement began in the United States, where the price index of the Bureau of Labour then stood at its highest point, 272. A year later, this index had been brought down to 151. The United States have, by this violent reduction of prices, probably brought themselves nearer to the pre-war price-level than any other country. This achievement has undoubtedly been the result of a more deliberate and consistent policy of deflation than has been enforced elsewhere, and therefore the effects of such a policy can best be ascertained by a study of American experience.- These effects have, in the case of the United States, been rather pernicious. The continuous expectation of a further fall in prices has evidently had a very restricting influence on the buying of the general public, and important branches of production have suffered severely from this sudden collapse of the market. The trades most seriously affected have been those engaged in building and construction, because the prospect of a continued fall of prices naturally makes enterprise particularly dangerous in cases where large amounts of capital have to be sunk in an enterprise which yields only a slow return over a long period of years. The steady reduction of prices has made it impossible, in a great many cases, to pay back money borrowed at a time when prices were higher. Thus, a huge amount of what is called &quot; frozen credit &quot; has been created. The liquidity, and even the ultimate solvency, of smaller banks have thereby been impaired to such an extent that severe measures became necessary. Further restrictions of credit have followed, with the result that prices have been forced down still more and fresh amounts of &quot; frozen credit&quot; have been created. The process of deflation has evidently, in this case, led to a vicious circle from which it seems extremely difficult to escape.The monetary policy of the United States bias had an important bearing on the treatment of the corresponding problems in other countries, anxious to keep up their currency at pre-war parity with the dollar, or, at any rate, not to let it suffer a further depreciation in comparison with the dollar.Such countries have undoubtedly been driven, by the action of the United States, to proceed further on the way of deflation than they would have deemed wise or expedient had they only had to look upon the matter as an internal monetary problem. The incessant rise in the purchasing power of the dollar has, however, made vain every effort of other countries to keep up their monetary standards in relation to the dollar. This is particularly conspicuous in the case of England. The &quot; Economist&quot; index of wholesale prices (if referred to the mean of 1913 as 100) stood in May 1920 at 304, whereas the index of the United States, as mentioned above, stood at 272. The serious efforts which England has made since that time to raise the value of the pound sterling have resulted in a fall of the general level of prices to 182 in May 1921. But, as in the same period the American index had fallen to 151, the relative position of the pound had not been bettered. The quoted figures show that the pound sterling was only 10-6 per cent, behind the dollar in May 1920, but 1.7 per cent, in May 1921.The results of the deflationist efforts of other countries are similar. Japan, the Scandinavian countries, France, and even, to some degree, Italy, have succeeded in bringing down, during the period May 1920 to May 1921, their general level of prices, and thus raising the internal value of their.money. But the internal value of the dollar having in the meantime been increased still more, the relative position . of the monetary units of these countries in regard to the dollar has in all cases become worse.The race between all these different countries to increase the purchasing power of their monetary units has made any stabilisation of the relative values of these units, and, therefore, of the exchanges between the countries, impossible. The instability and uncertainty of monetary conditions are, in spite of all sacrifices which the deflation policy has involved, just as great as they were a year ago-. Indeed, the world has now every reason for calling a halt, and asking whether its monetary affairs could not have been managed more wisely if the different countries had come to a mutual understanding to find a rational solution of the problem.The fall in prices has, of course, not been uniform for all commodities. This could hardly have been expected, even if the whole movement had been provoked exclusively by monetary policy. As it is, other factors have played an important part in the revolution of the whole system of prices which we have witnessed.   We
need only think of the breakdoAvn of Central and Eastern Europe and the resulting disappearance of a demand which used to have great importance for certain commodities ; or of the sudden and almost complete annihilation of the world&apos;s saving capacity, which brought the trades engaged in construction to a standstill, or of the general insecurity and distrust in the future which has necessarily held back the demand for everything not of immediate use. These factors must inevitably have caused great alterations in the- usual relations between prices. The attention of the business community, like that of the general public, is naturally attracted towards such price movements, and there has therefore been a disposition to believe that the factors which have been described are the real causes even of the fall in the general level of prices. This is the reason why the role of monetary policy has only been recognised so slowly and so reluctantly. In reality, a fall in the general level of prices is always essentially a monetary phenomenon. The great disturbances alluded to can hardly have caused a reduction in the average1 level of prices in any country, except in so far as the general feeling of insecurity may have induced people not to exercise their buying capacity and to increase their reserves of money.Such action, which is in itself of a monetary character, seems indeed to have been taken to a certain extent during the last year. In the preceding period of rising prices the stock of money generally grew in about the same proportion as the price-level rose. The subsequent fall of prices has, however, not been followed by a corresponding reduction of the means of payment. This anomaly, which I think can be observed in almost every country where prices have fallen considerably, cannot well be explained otherwise than as due to a hoarding of money or, say, to an unusual increase in the demand for cash. An investigation into this question which I made for Sweden revealed the interesting fact that bank deposits as well as bank notes of the higher denomination (1,000 kronor) had been reduced about normally and that bank notes of the smallest denominations (10 and 5 kronor) had also been reduced, although not so much. But in the notes of medium denominations (100 and 50 kronor) an actual rise had taken place. These observations gave some indication of the reason why the decline in the total volume of the means of payment which might have been expected to decrease simultaneously with the fall in prices has been retarded. Certain classes, perhaps mostly labourers and peasants, who do not use cheques for payments, have accumulated notes of middle denominations in the period of abundant income and now keep them as a reserve, whereas the stock of money actually used for payments has decreased approximately as expected. Whether this result has a more than local bearing can be decided only after similar investigations in other countries.It should also be observed that the index of wholesale prices, as now constituted, does not represent a true and stable level of prices. In many countries, wholesale prices to-day are to a great extent, so to speak, bankruptcy prices, the quotations being influenced, more or less considerably, by forced sales of stocks. It is commonly known that in a great many cases commodities cannot be produced at a cost which w ould be covered by the prices of the present demoralised markets. An index number which is an average of such prices is no trustworthy representation of the actual situation in regard to prices.- Only when prices have adjusted themselves to one another so as to make prices of products correspond to their cost of production, can we&apos; regard the usual index number of wholesale prices as a fairly reliable index of the movements of the general level of prices. This means, in particular, that wages and prices of commodities must be adjusted to one another so that wages truly represent the price which the consumer is willing to pay for the service rendered. It also means that prices of commodities must include that remuneration of capital which is necessary in order to acquire the service of fresh capital. It is well known how very far our present system of prices is from satisfying these conditions.Accordingly, if the present index numbers of wholesale prices give a somewhat exaggerated idea of the fall in the general level of prices, it is natural enough that the stock of money should not have been reduced in the same proportion as these figures indicate.As long as price movements are as irregular as they are at present, and as long as commodity prices, wages and profits have not adjusted themselves to a true economic equilibrium, it must be extremely difficult to find sufficient guidance in any price statistics for a monetary policy aiming at a stabilisation of the purchasing power of the monetary unit. And, indeed, such a.stabilisation is never practically possible as long as the whole system of prices is continually disturbed by such violent
economic revolutions as are the inevitable consequence of the present unsettled or badly settled political situation. Therefore, a rational -treatment of the political problems, in the spirit of mutual co-operation between all nations, must necessarily go hand in hand with the realisation of a well-devised monetary programme. And in this respect, first of all, the whole problem of the German indemnity and the other international war debts has to be settled on realistic and practicable lines and without unreasonable disturbance of the world&apos;s trade.II. The Policy of Deflation.Before entering upon a discussion of the course that should be taken in regard to the programme of deflation it is necessary to set out clearly what the process of deflation actually means and what are its practical effects.Deflation is, shortly, a process by which the internal value of the monetary unit is increased. This means a deliberate raising of the purchasing power of this unit in regard to commodities and services i.e., a general and uniform reduction of prices, wages and salaries as measured in terms-of the monetary unit. . Even this simple observation is important if we are to clear up the current ideas on this question, for deflation has, undoubtedly, gained a part of its popularity from the widespread belief that it meant a reduction of expenses without a corresponding reduction of incomes.The means of effecting such a rise in the value of the monetary unit is a restric-tion in the supply of the means of payment and a consequent reduction of the nominal purchasing power of the public. To this end there are two measures at our disposal and, in present circumstances, both must be applied simultaneously. The first and most general is a restriction of credit, involving a curtailment of the amounts of loans and a more stringent selection between the different demands for loans. But the principal instrument of such a policy is an abnormally high bank-rate calculated to raise other rates of interest correspondingly above what the real scarcity of capital would require, and thus to place an effective brake on all forms of demand for credit. By combining such restriction of credit with a high degree of saving, a considerable reduction of the actual purchasing power of the public may be effected. The second measure consists in raising, by taxation, over and above what public expenditure would require, a sum of money to be used for cancellation of a part of the means of payment of the community.Theoretically, it is no doubt possible to bring down prices by these means as much as need be and to raise the purchasing power of the unit of money almost indefinitely. But, unfortunately, the process is incidentally attended by some rather disagreeable effects. Indeed, we have to take care that we do not get into a position in which we have to admit that though the cure was a. success the. patient succumbed. The warnings enunciated in the first Memorandum in regard to the dangers of a policy of deflation have shown themselves, during the past year, to be only too well founded. The first and most obvious effect of such a policy is on enterprise and production. Artificially increased difficulties in the way of obtaining necessary credit accommodation, combined with an artificially increased burden of taxation, would in themselves have a dangerously depressing influence on business activity. But the end which is expected to be attained by these means is even more disastrous in its effects; for the prospect of a long period of falling prices is most likely &quot;to kill industrial enterprise and the very spirit of economic progress. The experience which the United States and some European countries have gained in this respect during the last year is indeed so serious, and so valuable for everybody desirous to learn, that we should do well to pay it the very closest attention. This experience should on no account be taken as concerning only a small class of capitalists or business men; it extends more or less to the whole community, involving particularly the.threat of ruin to farmers and widespread unemployment to wage-earners.Hardly less serious are the effects of the policy of deflation on international trade. Not that a high value of its monetary unit would in itself be a drawback to the export trade of a country. The difficulties now experienced by the United States in selling goods to European countries are not due, as seems generally to be assumed, to the higher value given to the dollar by the process of deflation which has been going on in the States. If the exchange value of the dollar, as measured in European currencies, reflected only the higher internal purchasing power of American money the high exchange would clearly be fully compensated by low prices of American commodities and would in no way hamper American exports.
The real disturbance of international trade arises in connection with the movements of the internal value of the different monetary standards.The general uncertainty as to the future of the exchanges, caused by these movements, is most detrimental to all regular business. The alteration of the rates of exchange, which a process of deflation in one country can bring about in the space of time required for the production in that country of certain commodities for export, may easily amount to such a reduction in the exchange value of the foreign money for which the commodities are sold that the whole transaction becomes a failure from a commercial point of view. True, the money of his own country which the producer receives in exchange has, in the meantime, acquired a correspondingly higher value. But that is generally of no advantage for the producer, who, as a rule, uses this money to pay back debts incurred during the process Of production. This analysis shows that the real difficulty is, in principle, the same as the difficulty experienced in production for the home market where deflation, by producing a continuous fall of prices, acts as a great drawback to all forms of production that require more than a very short time.A sudden fall of prices in the exporting country may also cause a grave economic crisis in the countries which have bought the exported goods at high prices and have delivered them only when the fall in prices has already taken place. Owing partly to such circumstances, American exporters to South American countries have recently seen their orders cancelled and their exported goods accumulated at the ports of entry, whereas, the buying countries experienced severe financial difficulties and the exchange market was brought into complete disorder.When inflation is going on in some countries simultaneously with deflation in others, it is really not to be wondered at if the result is a general confusion of international exchanges. The prospect of further inflation has, as explained in the first Memorandum, the effect of depressing the exchange value of the currency concerned to less than its purchasing power parity. Unsettled political conditions may increase the distrust in the future of a currency and aggravate the international undervaluation of it. All these factors have been at work during the past year. In addition, the disturbing effects of the arbitrary regulation of international trade which were set out in the first Memorandum have since that time been demonstrated to superfluity. Short-sighted protectionist measures, particularly in connection with the payment of the German indemnity, have clearly shown themselves to be a most serious factor of irregularity and uncertainty in the whole field of international exchanges.Finally, we have to take account of the effects of depreciation on public finance. , By the enhancement of the value of money which has taken place during the past year, the real burden of public debt has in many countries been increased to a most serious extent; in some cases so much as to make it very questionable whether the country will be able to bear the burden. In consequence, a corresponding aggrava-tion of the burden of taxation will have to be faced whereby enterprise and production will, inevitably, be gravely handicapped during a practically unlimited series of years. The uncertainty whether countries which used to be regarded as first-class debtors will be able in the future to meet their obligations is, of course, a&apos; new and a very serious influence, which operates against that restoration of confidence which we so sorely need. If deflation be carried still further in such countries there can be no&apos; doubt but that their State, finances will break down and public bankruptcy will have to be declared, or, if this last stage is to be avoided and a veil thrown over the situation, their monetary policy will be again directed on the path of inflation, with the result that a new and probably rather violent fall in the value of the monetary unit will ensue.Such being the content and the effects of the programme of deflation; we may reasonably ask ourselves for what purposes such a process can be regarded as particularly desirable.There are several reasons for the general wish to see the monetary standard raised again to something like that its value was before the war. First&apos;, of course, the vague popular feeling that a sound economic future depends upon the restoration of pre-war conditions. The present price level is supposed to be abnormal and on this ground a reduction to the pre-war level is demanded. Natural as this view may be, it is fundamentally wrong. No general level of prices, actually ruling in a. country with paper money, can be &quot; abnormal.&quot; There is, indeed, as explained above, some abnormality in the present situation of prices, viz., that the different prices are not balanced against one another so as to correspond to a stable economic[7025]        &apos; C
equilibrium. This fault is of a general economic nature, and not monetary. But leaving this point aside and assuming prices to have attained an equilibrium relative to one another, the mere fact that these prices are on an average so much higher than pre-war prices does not stand in the way of the future development of the economic life of the country.Nor is the high level of internal prices in itself a handicap against the develop-ment of the external trade of the country. As soon as exchanges have adjusted themselves to the purchasing power parity of the money of the country relative to other standards the export and import trades of the country are in their normal state as far as monetary conditions are concerned. Therefore, as a means for securing a revival of external trade, efforts to restore the old parity with other standards are futile, and of course even detrimental because they are the most serious hindrance against the fulfilment of the most fundamental condition of sound inter-national trade viz., stability of exchanges.The desire to restore the old rates of exchange is evidently, to a large extent, founded on a feeling that a degradation in the international value of the country&apos;s money is somehow a degradation of the country itself. Much might, without doubt, be said in support of this view as long as the deterioration of the monetary standard of the country was going on. But it is a false ambition to try to make good the harm that may have been done in this way by reversing the process, for in monetary matters it is the alteration itself which is most harmful.A kindred motive for deflation is the desire to keep up the exchange with another country which is raising its monetary standard by a process of deflation. This is a very natural desire, but, having regard to the bad effects of every policy of deflation, the true remedy in such a case lies without doubt in stopping the process of deflation in the other country.Finally, the desire to restore the old gold standard is a general and very powerful motive for deflation. This desire involves two different aims. First, it is felt that there is no way out of the present paper money muddle than the re-establishment of a gold standard. Secondly, it is believed, often without much criticism, that this standard must necessarily be the old gold standard. As to the first point it is possibly true that the desire to revert to gold is so general and so strong that every effort however well founded theoretically, to build up a sound system of money on scientifically regulated paper standards would prove, for the present at least, to be a failure. But even if this is conceded, it does not by any means follow that the new&apos; gold standard must be founded on the same parity with gold as the pre-war standard.There is one reason, very honourable in itself, for desiring to go back to the old gold standard. Governments and issuing banks have pledged themselves to redeem their notes in gold at a fixed parity, it is looked upon as a breach of faith to declare these notes redeemable in a lower gold standard. The different aspects of the problem of a restoration of the gold standard can only be discussed more fully in connection with a more thorough analysis of the whole gold question. But it may be well to observe here that this way of looking upon the matter is a rather narrow and formal one.The bearer of a bank-note does not ordinarily ask for gold; he expects to be able - to buy commodities for it and usually does so in a very short time. The depreciation of the note during that time has in most cases been negligible and has not caused the bearer any appreciable loss. Tf the notes were declared to be redeemable in gold according to their present value the present bearers of the notes would in most cases suffer no disadvantage and would perhaps even not notice it.The redemption of notes in gold has not been prescribed primarily for its.own sake,- but in order to secure the greatest possible stability for the value of the money of the country. This stability is the principle interest of the public in regard to the money it uses and upon which it bases all its business calculations. Now this stability has already been lost and public faith in the monetary standard has already been disappointed. This is a very bad thing. But it cannot be made good again by any p&quot;rocess intended to raise the standard again, in a shorter or longer period, to its earlier value. This would only involve a new period of instability with fresh injury to enterprise and production. These very simple truths would, of course, be generally recognised if people could only become accustomed to look upon the bank-note not in the usual formal way, as a mere promise to pay, like all other obligations, but essentially as a representative of the whole monetary system of the country. The primary object of our monetary policy must be to restore soundness and stability to this system, not to fulfil formal requirements of justice which in the overwhelming majority of cases would have no reality behind them.
III. The Gold Question.It was pointed out in the first Memorandum that the value of gold had declined very considerably since the beginning of the war. This observation referred to the earlier part of 1920. Since that time, a movement has taken place in the reverse direction, with the result that gold has now regained perhaps the greater part of the loss in value which it previously suffered. This, of course, alters very . considerably the practical aspect of the gold problem inasmuch as the restoration of the old gold standard has been made even more difficult for countries Avith a depreciated paper standard than it was a year ago. But the analysis of the gold problem given in the first Memorandum is still valid. It is therefore only necessary here to add some few observations with special reference to the present situation.The position which gold held before the war as a monetary standard depended on the general assumption that the value of gold is something fixed to which all other values can safely be related. True, the economists knew that considerable variations occur in the value of gold as measured in terms of the commodities which gold can buy. But as these variations used to be spread over long periods, extending perhaps over the life-time of a generation, the average business man was not concerned with them in his daily transactions and therefore usually paid no attention to them.Now, gold having lost in some few years perhaps more than 60 per cent, of its pre-war value and then in one single year recovered something like half of this loss, it is plain to everybody that gold no longer possesses that stability of value wmich is the very foundation of its position as a monetary standard for the whole world. This radical alteration has been brought about by the almost complete destruction of the old gold market with its delicate machinery and by the fact that the international payments which this machinery is called upon to serve have grown to such fantastic figures that no machinery which the world ever possessed could cope with them. Prior to the war, there was a fairly free international movement of gold, permitting the metal to flow from one part of the world to another at a difference in price which would now be looked upon as absolutely insignificant. Some countries accumulated big gold funds, but they did it slowly and without appreciable disturbance of the market. And the countries which, as great creditors, might have drawn gold from the rest of the world in any amount did not do so, but used their income from investments abroad to pay for surplus imports of goods or to make new investments in foreign countries. In the case of Great Britain, the actual holding of gold was particularly small in relation to the position of that country in the world&apos;s finance and trade. Still, the fact that the country was a creditor country and that the rest of the world owed it such huge amounts of money on call enabled London to keep up a free gold market from which all demands for gold were normally satisfied without difficulty.It is this machinery which has been destroyed, all the essential conditions for its working having ceased to exist. The European countries have locked up their gold funds and prohibit, more or less stringently, all export of gold. Even when they are unable to meet their foreign obligations countries refuse to part with their gofd; and, curiously enough, the claimants do not insist upon haviftg it, for any considerable reduction of these gold-holdings is believed to be impossible without causing a serious economic crisis in the debtor country, and so, of course, impairing its ultimate capacity to pay. In these circumstances, European gold funds are, for all practical purposes, locked away from the world&apos;s markets.The war, which turned so many creditor countries into great debtors, has created one new big creditor country, the United States. The resulting situation is quite abnormal, in comparison with the conditions to which the world had got accustomed before the war. We now have a big creditor country which has, at the same time, a huge surplus of exports, and whose population has not yet acquired the habit of investing continuously, and on a large scale, in foreign securities; this situation is untenable. It has somehow to be modified so.as to open out the possibility of a.normal settlement of payments due to America. As it is, an inconveniently large proportion of the debts due to America are simply left unpaid, - and the volume of floating credits is thereby increased in a very unsound manner. Actual gold shipments are, to a considerable extent, the only way left open for making payments; and, in fact, America has received a huge sum of gold from the outside world during the past year.
Of course, a certain scarcity of gold must have been created by this enormous demand for gold for America. Most countries having locked up their gold funds, as stated above, the only regular supply left to the workTs market was the current production. It is difficult to see what the result would have been if an extraordinary source of supply had not been provided by the huge exports of gold from Russia which took place particularly during the first half-year of 1921.The demand for gold for American account has, in these circumstances, undoubtedly been a factor of importance in the sharp upward movement of the value of gold, which is the most prominent feature of the monetary history of the past year. Still, we should have no sufficient explanation of this movement if we were satisfied with a reference to the abnormally great American demand for gold. The question arises: &quot;What is the cause of this demand, and how far is it a result of deliberate monetary policy?It is generally admitted that the United States have caused great inconvenience to themselves, as well as to the rest of the world, by taking so much gold. But, it is said, they could not help doing so. They had simply to receive all gold which the rest of the world cared to send them. The formal truth of this answer cannot be disputed. But it throws no light on the essential question which, for practical purposes, is all important. &quot;Was it really necessary that so much gold should flow into the United States? The principal reason why the gold went there is, of course, that gold could buy more commodities there than in other parts of the world. And this higher purchasing power depended undoubtedly on the American monetary policy. By a deliberate process of deflation the general level of prices, as expressed in gold-dollars, was depressed in the most violent manner, i.e:, the value of gold in terms of commodities was proportionally raised. The result was that gold could buy in America avsteadily increasing quantity of commodities, and, at all times, a greater quantity of commodities than in other countries; so the gold went to America. Of course, the value of such gold as-could be exported to America immediately rose in other countries. The peculiar situation of the market had this effect, that the value of gold was practically determined by the value of the dollar. This value was steadily increased, but it was always possible to buy the dollar with an unaltered quantity of gold. Dollars could, e.g., always be procured by producing gold in South Africa and sending it to New York. And the most advantageous use of this gold was to let it go to America. Had no deflation taken place in the United States, i.e., had the internal value of the dollar been left at the level where it stood a year ago, the steady improvement of the pound sterling and of some other currencies would soon have brought the internal value of each of those currencies to its old parity with the dollar, and therefore with gold; and the condition of the exchanges would then, at any rate, no longer have acted as an additional stimulus to the influx of gold into the United States, which their suddenly won position as a creditor country perhaps, to a certain extent, made unavoidable.The amount of gold which the United States have taken during the last year is not in itself so important that it would have caused, under normal conditions, a very considerable rise in the value of gold. This is easy to see if we remember that in pre-War times the loss of. a whole year&apos;s production of gold would not have raised the value of gold, normally, by more than 3 per cent. The rise in the value of gold is, essentially, a result of the peculiar situation which has bound up the value of sold with that of the dollar and of the deflationist policy of the United States which has steadily raised the internal value of the dollar.Under ordinary circumstances, the endeavour of a country with a gold standard to bring down prices and thus &quot;to raise the internal value of its money would, according to classical doctrine, have caused an influx of gold into that country with a consequent increase in the total volume of the monetary purchasing power within the country. Thus, the depression of prices would have been counteracted and the internal value of the monev of the country would have been brought down to that of sold. In the present case, this automatically regulating machinery has not had sufficient opportunity to work effectively. First, the natural influx of gold into the United States has been held back by the prohibitions against gold exports now prevailing in .other countries, and the increase in the gold holdings of the States, great as it has been absolutely, has undoubtedly been made smaller than it would have been if the movements of gold had been quite free. Secondly, the gold which has gone to the States has not increased the circulation, or, more generally, the sum total of the monetary purchasing power within the country.   On the contrary, this
sum has been diminished. The deliberate deflation policy of the Federal Reserve Banks has, by its severe restriction of credits, resulted in a greater monetary stock of gold now serving as foundation for a smaller volume of means of payment. Thus the depression of prices has continued and the internal value of the dollar has risen with the result that, instead of the dollar being levelled down to the value of gold, gold has been raised to the value of the dollar. Of course, such a result would only have been possible in the case of a great country like the United States to which the rest of the world incessantly has to pay huge sums for old debts and for fresh export surpluses.This analysis makes it clear that sound conditions in the world&apos;s gold market will never be attained as long as no satisfactory means is found of settling the huge balance of payments due to the United States. The side of this question which concerns the debt of the Allied Powers to the Government of the United States will be discussed more fully below. As to the commercial side of the question, no more need here be said than that a policy by which the tariff walls of the United States are raised to almost prohibition limits must aggravate, to a serious degree, the solution of a problem which is in itself already difficult enough. If the United States wish to get paid, they must take commodities in payment. Indeed their newly-won position as a creditor country, claiming huge amounts of interest and profit on foreign investments, seems to involve the necessity of a radical change in their balance of trade, turning the traditional export surplus into an import surplus. This necessity can hardly be avoided, but might, to some extent, be mitigated if the American people could get accustomed to buying foreign securities and to investing capital abroad, both regularly and on a large scale. But the development of such habits will necessarily be a slow process and have a compara-tively narrow scope as long as the rich natural resources of the States give abundant opportunities for a more profitable use of capital at home. Therefore, the problem of the payments to America will, even with the wisest commercial policy, present great difficulties.A situation which makes the world&apos;s gold market dependent, to an extreme degree, upon one single country with an unsettled balance of payment must inevit-ably involve great insecurity in respect to the future value of gold. It is quite conceivable that the monetary policy of the United States may take a new course and that the period of deflation which has been discussed here may be followed by a new period of inflation reducing the internal value of the dollar and, therefore, of gold, perhaps very considerably. This would, of course, for the moment make resumption of gold payments for some European countries comparatively easy. But there would be no security in a gold standard established in such a manner. As long as the very foundation of the gold market is insufficient to give it the necessary stability there is always the risk that fresh violent alterations in the value of gold may make it impossible, or at least inadvisable, for most countries to keep up their gold standard. Our present experiences will, by and by, teach us that the use of gold as a common standard for all countries, to which we were accustomed before the war, necessarily depends on two conditions viz., first, that we have a world-wide gold market with fairly free movements of gold, and secondly, that the world &apos;s balances of payment are normally settled, without much recourse to this gold market.Turning now to European conditions, it is plain enough that the German indemnity and the Inter-Allied war debts constitute factors of uncertainty of such importance that it is vain to expect any stability in the system of international payments as long as no satisfactory settlement of these debts has been arrived at. The disturbing effects on the machinery of the exchanges, which any attempt at an actual payment of these debts would have, has been sufficiently demonstrated by the relatively small indemnity payments already made. It is hardly conceivable that even the best established system of gold standards could stand the strain of the payments which an actual liquidation of these debts would require. It is easy enough to stipulate that such-and-such sums shall be paid in gold. But it is much more difficult to foresee what effect such stipulations, if actually enforced, will have on the gold market and on the value of gold. The mere existence of huge debts for which no regular machinery of payment has been provided makes the future of the value of gold extremely uncertain.In late years, the Eastern demand for gold has also proved to be a considerable factor of insecurity in the gold market. The &quot;amounts of gold taken by India and China have shown extraordinary variations; they have varied from less than nothing[7025] D
in 1918 to a maximum in 1919 of more than half, the world&apos;s total production for that year. These variations have, of course, seriously affected the balance of fresh gold available as money for the Western world, and have thereby contributed to the instability of the gold market.International economic relations and the actual situation of the gold market being such as here outlined, it seems to be almost a practical impossibility for any European country, acting alone, to restore a gold standard, even at a reduced parity. This is clear enough so far as the smaller countries are concerned. Theoretically, any country which has attained an equilibrium in its State finance might choose a gold parity corresponding to the present value of its money, and henceforth regulate this money so as to secure its convertibility in gold at the fixed parity. To meet the demand for gold which would arise from occasional fluctuations in the exchanges, the country would need a gold fund of a certain size. But a small country which accumulated a gold fund sufficient for occasional demands from its own internal market would find this fund quite insufficient for satisfying similar demands from abroad. If the country had been alone among European countries to restore the gold standard, it might quite easily see its whole gold fund suddenly exported to satisfy foreign demands for gold. For. this reason, no small country can take the lead in the restoration of the gold standard in Europe.The only European country which can conceivably become strong enough to resume gold payments independently of the others is Great Britain. But the main-tenance of a gold standard and a free gold market would meet with great difficulties so long as the old position of London as the world&apos;s creditor for short-term loans had not been restored. A serious obstacle to the restoration of a British gold standard seems to lie in the British war-debt to the United States Government. Until.an agreement has been arrived at which removes the threatening influence of this debt upon the equilibrium of international payments a, re-establishment of a -free gold market in England can hardly be expected.On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that, if all European&quot; countries which are now locking up their gold funds decided to let gold out freely, the United States would soon get so much gold that it is difficult to see how they could prevent a violent fall in the value of gold. It would hardly be possible to increase the percentage of gold reserves to liabilities indefinitely, and the banks would therefore be forced to extend their credits and thus to increase the volume,of the means of payment. Then the general level of prices would rise--i.,e:, the purchasing power of the dollar would fall, perhaps so much as to bring down the international value of the,dollar to the old parity with the pound sterling. In this way, English money might, as pointed out in the first Memorandum, regain its old gold parity. The same would then probably be the case with the Swedish, Dutch and Swiss currencies. But whether any real stability in international monetary relations were thereby reached, would still depend on the farsightedness and stability of American monetary policy and on the other conditions described above.A real stability of the gold market can, in fact, never be obtained until the gold standard has been restored in several countries and actual gold payments have been resumed in a considerable part of the world. The true basis of a trustworthy gold market can only be a world-wide international trade, carried on on a gold basis. On the other hand, such a restoration of the gold standard is&apos; only possible on the condi-tion that the gold market has already acquired some stability. The only way to a solution of a problem which presents such complications seems to lie in a mutual co-operation of the nations with a view of securing that agreement in policy and that unity of effort which, alone promise success where isolated action would necessarily fail. A rational settlement of the question of war debts and their payment is, of course, a sine qua non if any effort to restore stability and reliability to&apos; the worldJs monetary machinery is to be successful. But the co-operation here suggested would be specifically directed at an arrangement with regard to the way in which this machinery should be connected with gold.Let us now suppose, in order to get a complete view of the subject before us, that the particularly disturbing factors now discussed ,have been removed, and that more normal conditions have thus been restored to the gold market. The resumption of gold payments would then be within the practical reach of all countries which had obtained sufficient control over their own monetary policy to enable them to secure a fair degree of stability for the value of their money in terms of commodities. The parity with gold which such a country could obtain for its monetary standard would be determined by the relations between the value of its money and the value of gold.
both values being expressed in commodities. The higher the value of gold at such time, the more impossible it would be to restore the old gold parity and the lower the new parity that would have to be chosen. It is therefore a common interest of all countries desiring to restore a gold standard, that the value of gold should be kept as low as possible, or at any rate, should not be raised unnecessarily.Now, a keen competition for gold will clearly tend to raise this value considerably. A general restoration of the gold standard cannot, therefore, not be furthered by the usual popular device according to which every country should try to accumulate the largest possible gold fund. Such a policy can only have the effect of forcing a more general devaluation of monetary standards in comparison with gold and of making in each particular case such devaluation go much further than if a more reasonable attitude towards the problem hac- been adopted. If the world really wishes to see gold restored again as a common standard of value, the different countries must come to some understanding tending towards a general restriction * of their monetary demand for gold.The gold problem has one other aspect which requires some attention. Even if we could assume all the peculiar difficulties of the present situation removed, the question would still remain whether, for the future, we can reckon upon a sufficient supply of gold to give the metal a stable value. -As to the future of the world&apos;s gold market, it was observed in the first Memorandum that stability in the value of gold (assuming the relative demand for&quot; the metal to be constant) will require a yearly production of gold amounting to 3 per cent, of the total mass of gold at any time. This production would cover the need for fresh gold created by general economic progress and by the absolute los&quot;s of gold annually. At present, stability in the value of gold would require, on these grounds, an annual production of slightly over 100. million pounds and this production would have to increase annually by about 2-8 per cent. The world&apos;s total production of gold amounted, however, in 1920 to only about 70 million pounds. After having reached a maximum of 96-4 million pounds in 1915, the production has steadily decreased.   The actual figures are in millions sterling : 1915      ...      96-4 1918      ...      7901916      ...      93-5 1919      ...      75-21917      ...      86-3 1920 700Expert opinion regards it as probable that a rise in production will take place up to something like 75 millions, perhaps 80 millions, but hardly more. We have therefore to reckon with the fact that the world&apos;s production of gold has become, definitely, insufficient for the rate of economic progress which we used to regard as normal before the war. Assuming that the world is not going to give up ^his rate of progress, a general restoration of the gold standard with the consequent progressive development of the monetary demand for gold would inevitably result in ,an increasing scarcity of gold and a continuous rise in its value. This would mean that the world condemned itself, for an unlimited future, to a slow but progressive process of deflation with all its evil effects on enterprise and production as well as on public finance. The programme suggested in the first&apos; Memorandum of a progressive reduction in the monetary demand for gold is, under such circumstances, of very practical importance. In fact, the only reasonable alternative to such a programme is the immediate and definite abandonment of the use of gold as a monetary standard.IV. Practical Measures for Stabilisation.Restoring of the golcT standard being such an extremely complicated problem, the definite solution of which is certainly not to be expected in the immediate future, the first practical aim for the monetary policy of every country must be to give a stable internal value to its own monetary standard. This is all the more obvious because such a stabilisation is, in any event, a necessary pre-requisite for the restoration of a stable gold standard.The question then arises what means we. have at our disposal for carrying through, in actual practice, such a policy of stabilisation. On one point we&apos; must first be clear : even the best monetary policy will not be able absolutely to prevent fluctuations in the general level of prices. Least of all would this be possible when the up and down movements of the price level are so violent as they are at present. What we may aim at is to counteract these movements and thus to keep them within the narrowest possible-limits. It follows that we have to apply quite opposite
means in the different phases of price fluctuation. In a period of rising prices and of an increasing volume of credits and of means of payment we have to direct all our efforts towards restriction, A high rate of interest and; a severe cutting down of the demands for credit are then the right means. Again, in a period of falling prices, general lack of confidence and reduced demands for credit we have to use the opposite means. In other words; at the top, or rather already while we are approaching the top, deflation is the.right thing to be recommended. In the contrary case a certain inflation is called for.This may seem a dangerous doctrine, when so much energy still has to be bestowed on combating the tendencies to continued inflation which, indeed, cannot yet be regarded as dead; and, certainly, it is dangerous. If, nevertheless, such a programme must be drawn up, it is of paramount importance that it be . made clear that the ultimate aim of monetary policy is stabilisation. If the authorities wish to command the confidence of the public they must bind them-selves in the most solemn manner to such an aim. But this involves their having decided for themselves what value they wish to give to the money of the country; that it to say, what is the general level at which they will attempt to stabilise prices. And such a decision must be made public. Indeed, the co-operation of the whole nation is necessary for attaining the end, and, therefore, the nation must know that there is a definite aim and a unity of purpose in the changing phases of action and in the seemingly opposite measures applied.The principal practical difficulty in carrying out such a policy of stabilisation is the irregularity in the movements of prices. Different categories of prices move differently. Generally, wholesale prices lead the way, retail prices and wages . lagging behind; and this is true in the downward and well as in the upward move-ment. It is&apos; then not quite easy to say, at any particular moment, in which phase the whole development stands; the more so as even prices of the same category often show very divergent movements. We may find some guidance in the follow-ing rule: when wholesale prices are considerably above cost of production (including normal profits), this is a sign of inflation and a policy of deflation should be applied ; again, when wholesale prices are generally insufficient to cover the cost of production we may take this as a proof that the prpcess of deflation has gone too far, and that more normal relations have to be restored by an extension of credit and an increase in the monetary purchasing power of the community.The level at which we wish to stabilise wholesale prices should be chosen so that the necessary equilibrium between the price of products and the cost of their production is established with the least disturbance to wages and other prices entering into the cost of production. But as different classes of wages have, generally, moved very differently, and as their relative position is not now compatible with a true economic equilibrium, a readjustment of wages will in most cases be necessary. This readjustment will inevitably involve some curtailment of real wages for certain classes of labourers, and is therefore likely to cause some unrest and some difficulties. In order to avoid any unnecessary aggravation of these difficulties, it is probably wise to abstain from every attempt to press down the general level of monetary wages. If this has already been done to some extent, there is all the more reason for not insisting upon a further reduction. The general level at which nominal wages should be stabilised having been agreed upon in this manner, the stable level of wholesale prices is the level at which cost of production is covered.Even with these general rules we shall certainly, in practical life, have to face situations where it is extremely difficult to find reliable guidance for the rational treatment of the problem of stabilisation. We can therefore only hope to realise our aim gradually and in a relative manner. But it is already a very important step forward if we can considerably reduce the present abnormally wide fluctuations in the price-level.Every policy of stabilisation will, as already explained, necessarily involve the direction of monetary policy in periods of depression, towards a rise in prices. It is then interesting to analyse the effects of such a policy of inflation as distinguished from the continuance of inflation at a time when inflation has already brought prices to an abnormal height. The difference in effect is indeed very considerable.When production has already been artifically stimulated by inflation, every further extension of credit and creation of money means a net increase in the nominal purchasing power of the community without any corresponding increase of the mass of commodities in w sold.  The productive capacity of the community being already
fully employed there is no possibility for an extension of production. The fresh purchasing power created can therefore only find something to buy by causing a general rise of prices. Thus prices, as explained in the first Memorandum, must rise.In a period of severe depression brought about by a process of deflation, a return to a more liberal credit policy will set production going where it has come to a standstill, and procure employment for labour, machinery and other instruments of production which have before been idle. The mass of commodities to be bought will therefore very soon be increased, and thus there will be something to set up against the additional purchasing power which may have been created. The rise of prices caused by the extension of credit must, consequently, in this case be smaller than in the case of continued inflation. The policy now discussed will have a decidedly beneficial effect on the economy of the community, increasing its real income and mitigating the social troubles connected with prolonged and widespread unemployment. These advantages will go far to balance the evils unavoidably caused to certain classes by every reduction in the value of the monetary unit. And if the policy of stopping deflation and reverting to a higher normal level of prices is managed well, it is quite possible that the balance for the community as a whole may show a very considerable net advantage.The condition is, of course, that the new credit created is used exclusively for productive purposes, and not only that, but for such investments which are likely to call forth, in the most immediate future, an important increase of production. There are always, under the circumstances assumed, ample opportunities for invest-ments of this kind. For such productive concerns as have been going and are fully equipped, but have been brought to a standstill by the economic depression caused by deflation, generally need little fresh capital to set them going again. The confident belief that prices have ceased to fall, and are even likely to rise moderately, is in itself a very potent factor in setting the wheels of industry turning round. Further, there are, particularly in the present state of things, several points in the productive organisation of the community where something, perhaps very, little,, is; lacking which would give to the whole machinery its full efficiency. If at such points the needed equipment is provided, the addition to the total output may prove out of all proportion greater than the expenses involved. If, e.g., some bridges of a great railway system have been destroyed, or if there is a lack of locomotives, an investment of capital for making good such deficiencies will soon be productive of increased efficiency, not only in the whole railway system, but in the productive machinery of the country at large. If, at the lowest stage of depression caused by a continued process of deflation, fresh credit is .created for these and similar purposes, the community may very soon see its real income, e.g., in the shape of home and colonial supplies of food and raw materials, increased so much as to justify the increase in the sum of nominal means of payment.The public will probably be inclined to believe that such credits may just as well be used for any other purpose; and particularly there is always the risk that such an opening will be exploited for an increase of public expenditure. Therefore, when recommending, under the circumstances here assumed, a more liberal credit policy, one feels obliged to underline very strongly the warning against any abuse of such policy.A return to a more liberal credit policy during the deepest depression is not likely to cause a fresh wave of over-speculation or to be a temptation for investors to spend further capital on industrial equipment which is already more than sufficient. The psychological conditions are very different from those prevailing in a period of continued inflation and the effects of a more plentiful supply of means of payment will therefore be different even in this respect. A low rate of interest may certainly call forth considerable issues of new securities on the stock exchange. But, in reality, such a result will mainly represent the transformation of old floating engagements to more durable investments, and ought therefore to be greeted with satisfaction as a sign of a wholesome consolidation.Still, the directions which investments take and the purposes for which fresh capital is required should be carefully watched. A certain selection will be neces-sary and for this purpose the co-operation of the whole business community, and particularly of the banks, is required.[7025]E
V. Disturbing Effects of International War Debts.It is generally recognised that the existence of the huge international debts which the war has left behind it has a disturbing influence on exchanges, and adversely affects the restoration of a gold standard. But the real gravity of this influence is not always perceived, nor is the true character of the difficulties created by these debts sufficiently clear to the public mind. Certain aspects of the problem of post-war international indebtedness having been brought into fuller light by the experience and the discussions of the last twelve months, it is necessary, even within the limited scope of this paper, to give some attention to this problem.Foremost in practical importance among the international war debts stands the German indemnity, not merely on account of its magnitude, but still more because payments have actually begun to be exacted, and will continue to be exacted in the near future, under the threat of heavy and far-reaching penalties, whereas in the case of other war debts payment is still looked upon as a problem of to-morrow. The difficulties involved in the actual payment of the debts and the disturbing effects of an attempt to enforce such payment are, however, in both cases of the same nature; and an analysis of the case of the German indemnity has, accordingly, a bearing beyond the limits of the particular case, which it would be well to have in mind in every discussion of this controversial subject.The adverse influence of the indemnity on the world&apos;s recovery in general, as well as on efforts to restore sound monetary conditions, is due in the first instance to the fact that it is considered extremely dubious whether Germany will really be a,ble to fulfil the payments fixed in the London Agreement. It is indeed feared among those best acquainted with the details of the matter that the payments of the present year w7ill more or less exhaust Germany&apos;s available supplies of foreign exchange ; and that, therefore, the whole scheme for the payment of the indemnity will break down in 1922. What then will happen is the very troublesome question which more than anything else prevents the establishment of equilibrium in the world and which at the same time is one of the foremost causes of the general distrust of the stability of any system of money or international exchanges.The relatively small indemnity payments hitherto required according to the London scheme seem to have been made&apos; possible only by aid of extraordinary measures, and particularly by a further resort to the practice of selling German marks abroad. This practice must, as explained in the first Memorandum, depress the international value of the currency concerned beneath its internal value, and the depth of the depression must increase with the extension of the sales. In the case of the German mark the under-valuation has gone so far that, whereas the internal value of the currency may perhaps roughly be estimated at about two pence, the value in exchange is less than one penny. Buyers of German marks speculate on a rise of the exchange value to something approaching the internal value; but evil experience has taught them that this is a rather dangerous speculation-lation, and, therefore, a wide margin of possible profit, at present more than 100 per cent., is required to call forth fresh buyers. Of course,&apos; there is a limit for such sales beyond which no margin is able to call forth an appreciable demand, and every considerable extension of the sales naturally strengthens the fear of an approaching collapse of the market.The danger of Germany&apos;s being unable in a near future to fulfil her obligations, and of the political consequences which this failure would involve, is another important element in the growing distrust felt towards the German currency; and with a complete lack of stability in this part of the world&apos;s monetary system, there is little hope of any real stability being restored to the system as a whole.Assuming an arrangement to have been made which removed the difficulties as- to the German payments for the immediate future, the question will arise whether Germany will be able in the long run to fulfil the obligations laid upon her by the London scheme. In this connection it should be recognised that calculations of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay based on the estimated pre-war saving capacity of the country are entirely unsound. In the first place, the savings of the community are not, as is so often preached and believed in internal politics, a sum of money which may be used for any purpose which may be thought desirable. On the contrary, such savings are a necessary condition of economic progress, and they immediately take the form of the real Capital (houses, machinery, etc.) required for this progress.    Of course it may be said that a
country must sacrifice progress in order to pay its debts. But progress cannot well be stopped altogether without injury to the producing capacity of the country. The constant improvement of technical methods makes it necessary that the whole industrial equipment of the country should be continually renewed, and this is practically impossible without a constant supply of fresh capital, i.e., of savings. A growth of population clearly creates an equally imperative need for capital.Secondly, the savings of a country of the West European type normally amounted before the war to something about one-fifth of the current income of the country, and this rate of saving sufficed to secure the normal rate of progress. The savings of Germany were approximately on that scale. It seems a very moderate estimate to say that five years of the most terrific warfare, ultimate defeat and subsequent heavy penalties, must have reduced the earning capacity of the country by 20 per cent. The present income of Germany would then only correspond to that part of her pre-war income whioh was consumed, and any indemnity would have to be paid out of this income. Undoubtedly the main source of the indemnity must be a reduction of the pre-war standard of life of the German people. Such a reduction, however, is not practically possible without injuriously affecting thevstandard of life of *the mass of labourers, and involves an imminent danger that the efficiency of labour also will be reduced. But with a diminished efficiency of labour and a curtailment of the supply of fresh capital, the producing capacity of the whole country must decrease. Once this effect has been produced by too heavy claims for payment of the indemnity, further exaction of such claims will be economically impossible, and no &quot; sanctions &quot; will be able to alter this fact. ,On this ground it seems natural enough that there should steadily become more general and more profound the fear that the whole plan of indemnity payments, as now contemplated, will ultimately break down and the world be plunged again into political and economic chaos. In such a state of things it is obviously somewhat difficult today the foundation of the monetary system of the future, or, indeed, to do anything for the stabilisation of currencies and exchanges. As a matter of fact, practical business men in leading positions are now more and more often found to doubt the usefulness, in present circumstances, of any efforts in this direction. Still, if we are true to ourselves, we must feel that no one can really take the responsibility of abandoning all such efforts and acquiescing in the present monetary confusion.A disturbing element of a more technical nature, but of an immense practical importance, is the stipulation according to which the indemnity has to be paid in gold. The future value of gold is, as explained above, extremely uncertain, even the main factors determining it being beyond our control so long as no agreement has been reached between the leading countries with regard to their monetary demand for gold. The probabilities point, as we have seen, to an increasing scarcity of gold, with a consequent rise in the value of the metal. The stipulation of such huge payments in gold as the German indemnity represents cannot but materially affect the market, and will probably tend to strengthen still more the demand for gold in a world already insufficiently supplied. Thus it might easily happen that the enhanced value of gold made the burden of the indemnity much heavier than was originally contemplated, and in the end rendered it impos-sible to bear. At the same time, such a rise of the value of gold would make all other debts contracted in gold much heavier, and in many cases would completely undermine the solvency of debtors, public as well as private. In addition, all efforts and sacrifices for the restoration of a gold standard would probably prove futile, and the countries which had made such attempts would find themselves thrown back again on a paper basis. Even if a country succeeded in keeping up the gold standard, the confusion would hardly be diminished, for it would have to face a heavy fall in prices, and probably, as a result thereof, a serious depression in trade and production.It may be taken as certain that these grave consequences of the fixing of the indemnity in gold have not been taken sufficiently into consideration. There is, however, clearly no hope of a - restoration of stability in the world&apos;s monetary system until some means has been found of removing this particularly disturbing factor.Another side of the question before us is the problem of what has been called-&quot;the mobilisation of the indemnity.&quot;   The idea that the indemnity, or a part of it, [7025]   : . F
could be discounted and thus turned into immediately available money has cer-tainly not yet been definitely abandoned. It was said in the first Memorandum that the prospects of a great lending country the United States offering an inter-national loan on the security of the indemnity were practically nil. This view has since been confirmed. American bankers are not even willing to have the Repara-tion Bonds introduced into the American market. The declaration given in this matter on behalf of the American delegation at the meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce in London this summer was very clear. It was feared that any attempt to sell Reparation Bonds in America would depress prices and &quot; spoil the market, not only for these bonds, but for foreign offerings generally, and thus seriously interfere with all efforts to aid the European situation.&quot; That the sale of the bonds in any other country is still more impossible is plain enough. As long, however, as the owners of the bonds are in urgent need of money, it must always be feared that attempts will be made to put huge amounts of the bonds on the market. This danger will be a constant element of insecurity in transactions in international exchange and will make the much desired stabilisation- of rates still more difficult.Finally, we have to consider the ^indemnity question from the aspect which has so prominently engaged international discussion on the subject during recent months, via., the unwillingness of the claimants to receive the indemnity which they claim. This absurd situation, as it might be thought, is a result of the widespread influence which protectionist ideas have acquired since the war, principally by the exploitation of war-antagonism. The countries which are entitled to participate in the indemnity are not willing to receive German products; nor do they wish, in cases where actual reparation is required, to open their &quot;doors for German labour or German enterprise which would share the employment and profits offered by reparation work.Sometimes the ultimate consequences of this standpoint are recognised and it is declared that the indemnity must do more harm than good to the country receiving it and that it is better to abandon the whole indemnity. This is, of course, wrong. No economist, reasoning on purely economic grounds, could endorse such a view. To receive an indemnity is undoubtedly an economic advantage. But it is not an unmixed advantage. The indemnity must somehow be paid in commodities and services; these commodities and services must * compete with commodities and services supplied by the receiving country itself, and the competition must be so far successful as to allow the indemnity to be paid. In some branches of industry such competition is bound to have very disagreeable effects. The full real advantage can only be drawn from the indemnity payments when the economic life of the country has been adjusted to the new conditions. During the first period of adjustment the disadvantages will probably even preponderate. When the indemnity has ultimately been paid, a new adjust-ment will be necessary and will cause disturbances which, though probably not so serious as those of the first adjustment, will be disagreeable enough.At present, the primary problem for the countries which claim the indemnity would appear to be that of avoiding the initial disturbances, or at any rate mitigating them as much as possible. The usual plan is to throw these disturbances on to other countries, close the frontiers against German competition and let the flood of German goods go elsewhere. This course does not seem entirely just to other countries which have nothing to do with the indemnity, and these countries can hardly be expected to give their support to such a policy of economic devastation. The consequence has been a general growth of protectionism and, notwithstanding all that was said at the International Financial Conference at Brussels in favour of free trade and free intercourse between nations, the world is unmistakably moving in the opposite direction. This result of the indemnity is most unfortunate and injurious and is perhaps the most important hindrance to the economic recovery of the world which, even for the Allied countries, is of much greater interest than any indemnity. What makes the protectionism of to-day so especially pernicious-is that it leaves everything in a state of uncertainty. The world&apos;s trade can adapt itself to adverse conditions but in the present state of affairs no one knows to what conditions trade should be adapted.As long as the general situation of production and trade remains so abnormal and so uncertain, it is, of course, vain to hope for the restoration of any stability to the international exchanges. In this connection the intimate connection between the present monetary problem and the problem of the indemnity shows itself with singular clearness, and it becomes plain how indispensable a complete settlement
of the whole question of the indemnity, and of the means by whioh it is to be paid&apos; is as a condition for the success of any positive work on the reorganisation of the world&apos;s monetary system.What has been said here about the German indemnity applies also, to the other international debts which the war has left behind it. There is great uncertainty with regard to at least the greater part of these debts, as to whether the debtor countries will ever be able to pay the debts. There is also the fear that attempts, may be made to bring these debts on the market, and to enforce payments for interest and sinking fund. This general uncertainty with regard to the future of the international war debts causes a corresponding amount of insecurity in the international exchange market. The effects on the value of gold of an attempt to enforce the payment of these debts in gold can hardly be ascertained. Further, so soon as payment of these debts is seriously considered, the world will realise the immense difficulties of such a reorganisation of the world&apos;s trade as must be required for effecting the payment. It will then perhaps also be recognised more generally how unfair it is that a creditor country should be free to aggravate the real burden of the debts for the debtor country by not allowing payment in what it can deliver, or by raising high tariff walls against the commodities by means of which it is most convenient for the payment to be made. These considerations will, we may hope, lead to the recognition of a new rule of international justice creating more equality of rights between creditor and debtor nations.Such are the almost unsurmountable difficulties of the problem of the inter-national, indebtedness created by the war. The more attention one gives to this problem, the more unavoidably one is driven to the conviction that some reduction of this debt must take place. This reduction would necessarily mean a sacrifice for the principal creditor countries, Great Britain and the United States. But as these countries are, at the same time, the greatest participants in the world&apos;s trade, they would also have the foremost interest in the compensation which would accrue from a revival of the world&apos;s trade and a facilitation of the restoration of stability to the different monetary standards and the international exchanges. Great Britain could exchange claims on her Allies for certain amounts of indemnity bonds and cancel them. The United States could do the same on a still greater scale. They would thereby avoid all the disagreeableness and the real inconvenience of becoming Germany&apos;s creditors. Such a policy would, I do not hesitate to say, be for the real interest of the two leading commercial countries of the world. But it would require a magnanimity which must be spontaneous and which no outsider is entitled to demand..VI. Conclusions.The monetary problem of the world is at present so interwoven with political difficulties that it is vain to expect a definite solution until the chief political pre-requisites for stability in economic conditions have been realised. It is first of all necessary that the international indebtedness inherited from the war should be settled on such terms as satisfy the world that the debts can really be paid, and make it clear by what concrete means payment can be offered and accepted. It might therefore seem that the whole discussion of monetary questions has to be deferred to some future day. But this would be a grave mistake. The world&apos;s monetary problem involves great technical difficulties which require a thorough examination by experts and a certain amount of co-operation between the different nations. There are two principal questions to be considered: the question of the stabilisation of the internal value of currency, and the gold question. How these questions are related to one another, and to what extent they are of an inter-national character, has been shown above. The elucidation of these questions not only is an indispensable condition of the establishment in the future of a sound basis for the world&apos;s economic life, but also would be of great immediate utility. The experience of the past year has shown conclusively that some guidance is needed amid the confusion into which the world&apos;s monetary affairs has fallen; continued inflation on one side and excessive deflation on the other having deprived the world of every sense of equilibrium in the purchasing power of money and in international exchange.The only way to secure such guidance within a reasonable time would seem to be to refer the whole problem, as far as it involves purely monetary questions, to
a small committee of experts. In view of the central position which the United ij States have come to occupy since the war in all monetary affairs, and particularly M in connection with the gold market, the representation of the United States on such ?P a committee is most important. In principle, however, the committee should not i*epresent nationalities for expert knowledge and experience. The creation of such a committee Would be a sign of the willingness of the World to solve its monetary difficulties by mutual understanding and action along common lines. The feeling that the time is ripe for such action is visibly growing stronger day by day.
