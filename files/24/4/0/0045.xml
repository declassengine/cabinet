SECRET. G.-194.RESTRICTION OF IMPORTS. Further Report of the Committee.(Previous Paper G.-178.)1. THE War Cabinet will remember that on the 6th November, 1917, they had under consideration a Memorandum by the Ministry of Shipping (G.T.-2493) of the 2nd November, in which it was estimated that the imports for 1918 would have to be less by some 8,000,000 tons of imports.2. A Committee of Ministers was appointed &quot; to consider to what extent and in what directions imports should be further restricted &quot; (War Cabinet 266. Minute 11).3. The Committee submitted an Interim Report on the 1st December, 1917 (G.-178) which arranged for reductions amounting to 5,500,000 tons, and allowed for improvement in the submarine situation equivalent to 2,000,000 tons.On the 5th December the War Cabinet adopted this report as a working basis subject to certain minor amendments (War Cabinet 292, Minute 14).4. On the 15th December the Ministry of Shipping submitted a Memorandum in which it was pointed out that while the reductions arranged by the Committee amounted on paper to 5,500,000 tons weight, they were not worth their face value from a shipping point of view, owing mainly to the fact that the reductions were made disproportionately on imports from short distances (G.T.-3388). A further reduction, therefore, of at least 2,500,000 tons was still required.5. On the 24th January, 1918, the Restriction of Imports Committee were requested to reassemble and investigate the whole position in regard to the claims of the different Departments (War Cabinet 330, Minute 1 (a)).6. We have examined with representatives of the Departments concerned their requirements and the sacrifices involved by the deficiency of tonnage. In the light of the information obtained in our investigations we now submit the following, recomm endations: 7. Paper and Pulp.We recommend that a further reduction be made in paper and pulp of 50,000 tons during the next six months.In this, connection we call the W^ar Cabinet&apos;s attention to the fact that leading London newspapers, are maintaining, and in some cases even increasing their size, and that the number of business circulars, catalogues, &amp;c, seem still to be greatly in excess of what is demanded by the war situation.8. Cotton.In our previous. Report. (G.-178). we recommended an increased importation for 1918, as compared with-1917, of 50,000 tons in order to maintain the consumption for the whole year at the same level as 1917. [248][This Document is the Property of His Britannio Majesty&apos;s Government,] -Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1918.
We are informed that Avhile there are at present about 40,000 cotton operatives out of employment there appears to be no unrest at the moment, because the opera-tives out of employment are being supported by a fund. This fund, however, will cease in June, and it may be that the Government will then have to come to the assistance of the unemployed operatives if other work cannot be found for them.It is estimated that, roughly speaking, a further reduction of 200,000 tons of cotton would mean a further 200,000 people being thrown out of employment.The President of the Board of Trade has undertaken to prepare a paper show-ing the results of reductions of different dimensions, ranging from 100,000 tons to 250,000 tons.The Committee recommend that a substantial reduction should be made, having regard, inter alia, to the fact that the reductions in munitions import also cause unemployment without a direct war result.9. Timber.The extensive felling of home-grown timber has been one of the cardinal points in the policy of Restriction of Imports without which the tonnage situation could not have been saved.In 1916 the imports of timber were about 6,300,000 tons. In 1917, owing to restrictions imposed, the imports are estimated to have fallen to about 2,600,000 tons.In our previous Report (G.-178) we recommended another cut of 1,000,000 tons of the 1917. We now recommend a further reduction in oitwood amounting to 200,000 tons. .In making this recommendation we feel bound to point out (a.) That the end of the tether, as regards the importation of timber, has almost been reached;(&amp;.) That in order to obtain the further amount of home-grown timber it will be necessary for all Departments concerned (e.g., the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of National Service) to render every possible assistance to the Timber Controller.10. Sugar.Sir Charles Bathurst has supplied us with details as to the sugar position. As compared with 1917 the situation is very satisfactory. There is now a stock of about 170,000 tons as compared with a stock of some 23,000 tons at the worst time of last year.As regards further reduction it does not seem possible to take anything off the amount required for jam, and the only direction in which restriction might now be made appears to be in domestic uses.The total domestic consumption for the year is estimated at about 610,000 tons. If the sugar ration were therefore reduced by a quarter, i.e.. by two ounces from bight ounces to six ounces, there would be a total^saving of 150,000 tons a year.No great objection has been raised by the public in regard to the \ lb. ration, md it seems likely that the public will submit to a further reduction.In view of these facts we recommend the War Cabinet to authorise the reduction )f the sugar ration from eight ounces to six ounces per head per week, in order to pbtain a total saving of 150,000 tons a year.11. Meat.We have had under consideration the possibility of the further slaughter of cattle in this country, and Lord Rhondda has undertaken to examine the question with the Board of Agriculture. He has, however, told us that he cannot hold out any encouragement of further reductions in the stocks of cattle.In this connection we discussed the question of rationing in the army, navy, and merchant service. It was stated that whereas the civilian, working for instance on munitions, was lucky if he got 1^ lbs. of meat a week, a sailor at sea or a soldier at the base in France received 1\ lbs. of meat a day.We are of opinion that the ration scales should be revised from the point of view of work done, and as regards the army, of whether the area in which the soldier is serving, is a combatant or non-combatant area.
We suggest that the War Cabinet should instruct the Departments concerned to revise the ration scales from the point of view of the nature of the various duties and the areas in which they are performed.12. Petroleum.We have considered the question of reducing the imports of petroleum. Our attention was called to the special importance of obtaining such tank vessels from America as would enable the Admiralty to dispense with the double bottoms for oil fuel. We also discussed the questions of increasing home supplies, and the desira-bility of restricting the use of petrol for commercial purposes such as retail deliveries. These are matters which come within the province of the Petroleum Executive, and therefore we have written to ask that Committee to consider a possible reduction in the imports of petroleum.We hope that a reduction amounting to perhaps 50,000 tons may be possible, but until we hear from the Petroleum Committee we are not in a position to submit a definite figure.13. Brewing.On the 1st January the question of whether a reduction of 50,000 tons could be made in the amount of barley imported for brewing was referred to us by the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 309, Minute 4). We have examined the matter with representatives of the Ministry of Food and the Liquor Control Board, and we have approved the proposal of the Ministry of Food that 250,000 quarters of barley (equivalent to 50,000 tons of freight) should be taken from the brewing trade and released for the loaf. We have also agreed to the proposal of the Ministry of Food whereby a saving of some 20,000 tons of freight per annum can be effected by substituting 3,000 tons per month of glucose for barley.A further considerable reduction, perhaps amounting to about one-third or one-fourth of the imports consumed could be effected without reducing the quantity of beer supplied by forcing the strong proprietary brewers to dilute down to the standard of other beer.We recommend to the War Cabinet that the downward dilution should be made whereby a saving would be effected of about 200,000 tons of freight a year.We understand that the Shipping Controller is bringing the larger question of total prohibition of brewing for separate and special consideration by the War Cabinet at an early date.14. Munitions.The Minister of Munitions has prepared a paper showing the effect of recent and proposed tonnage reductions.The shipping required to meet programmes of all Departments in full would be 15,000,000 tons.  The actual imports in 1917 were 12,500,000 tons.On the basis of reductions imposed by the Restriction of Imports (G.-178), the imports in 1918 will be 11 millions. The Minister of Munitions has now been requested to prepare two programmes for further reductions by (a) 1,000,000 tons, (6) 1,500,000 tons, reducing the munitions import from the figure of last year by 2,500,000 and 3,000,000 tons respectively. Programme (a), involving 1,000,000 tons additional, will reduce the allocation to tjie Admiralty by 400,000 tons. No reduction was made from the allocations on the first cut of 1,500,000 tons, but in view of the objections to this proposal, raised by the representatives of the Admiralty at our meeting, we have asked that Department to state their case on the subject to the War Cabinet.We hesitate, at present at any rate, to recommend programme (b) involving 1,500,000 tons additional, because any further reduction beyond the 1,000,000 tons would have to come directly off the gun ammunition programme which, as the War Cabinet will remember, was cut. down, under our previous recommendations in December, by 500,000 tons of steel for army shell.We therefore recommend the War Cabinet to accept the Ministry of Munitions&apos; programme (a) for a further reduction of imports by 1,000,000 tons, including 400,000 tons from the Admiralty, leaving it to the latter Department to state their case to the War Cabinet.
15. Summary of Recommendations. To summarise: The Committee were confronted by an additional estimated tonnage deficiency during the year of at least 2,500,000 tons.This deficiency may be off-set by restriction of imports in the following way:: Tons.By Paper      ... Cotton, sayPit wood SugarBrewing materials Miscellaneous Munitions Oil, say (not yet agreed to Executive)by the PetroleumTotal100,000 200,000 200,000 150,000 200,000 100,000 1,000,00050,0002,000,00016. Remaining Deficit.It will thus be seen that the total amount of reductions, now recommended, do not meet the tonnage deficit by some 500,000 tons. Moreover, the Ministry of Munitions&apos; figures as now stated only include 300,000 tons of phosphate rock whereas the Board of Agriculture require 600,000 tons.Even the suggested reductions are open to further comment, as regards Munitions by the Admiralty, Cotton and Miscellaneous by the Board of Trade, and Oil by the Petroleum Executive. The authority of the War Cabinet will be required before they can be made effective.Further, the tonnage for the conveyance of 150,000 United States troops, amounting perhaps to 450,000 tons, has not been taken into account.There remains, therefore, a deficit of upwards of 1,000,000 tons. Having regard, however, to the extreme uncertainties of the tonnage situation, we are of opinion that, for the present, we should leave this remaining deficit outstanding.It is too early to decide upon which Departments the further reductions should fall. The requirements of munitions obviously depend largely upon the date and scale at which the enemy attempts in the West are opened. There are many other factors which are not yet clear. We think it desirable that the Committee should reassemble at a later date, when the position should be re-examined.Meanwhile, we recommend that the Munitions Budget should be sanctioned on the reduced basis of 10,000,000 tons import, and that the Department should have authority to place orders sufficiently in excess of this amount to make sure that every advantage may be taken of the accidents of shipment.CURZON OF KEDLESTON,Chairman,for the Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., February 11, 1918.
