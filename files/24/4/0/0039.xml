-   182This Document is the Property of His Britannic Mapesty&apos;s Government,] Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1918.SECEET.G.-188.SOLDIERS5 AND SAILORS5 PAY COMMITTEE.Third Report.(Previous Papers G.-154 and 172.)1. In dealing with the question of increased emoluments for officers of the Navy and Army, we have had not only to consider methods of meeting the special conditions of each service separately, but also to devise a solution which could be applied to both without giving rise to further effects upon either. This has involved prolonged examination and discussion of details.2. The pay codes of both services rest on very ancient foundations, and though piecemeal alterations have been made here and there in recent times, there has been no comprehensive review of the two systems as a whole. Our examination of the subject has convinced us that such a review is overdue; but we have felt precluded from entering upon that task, and have confined ourselves as far as possible to that of providing for the junior officers of the two services emoluments not wholly inadequate to their needs.A rmy.3. In this connection we have had to consider the requirements of the officer himself (including upkeep of uniform, the first cost of which is already provided by a grant), his wife, children, and other dependent relations. After full con-sideration, and.in view of the difficulties which experience has shown to be inherent in the administration of a special scheme for dependents, especially with more than half the officers of the Army already in theatres of war, some very distant, we have reached the conclusion that the institution of schemes of separation allowances for wives and dependents on the lines of those that have existed since the early days of the war for men is impracticable, and that the officer should be given a rate of pay sufficient to provide the necessary maintenance for himself and a wife or dependent, with additional allowances for children. While under this method there may be some payments in excess of actual necessities to a comparatively small number of Army officers with neither wife nor dependent, the gain in promptitude and simplicity of administration in the case of the Army will be enormous.4. On these lines we have adopted 10s. Qd. a day as the minimum rate for an Army officer of any arm. and have put the children&apos;s allowances at 21. per month for each child, with a maximum of SI. per month. The age limits we propose are those already in existence for allowances to children of deceased officers, viz., 18 for boys and 21 (or marriage if earlier) for girls, with extension in case of invalids.5. This rate of 10s. 6^. is an increase of 3s. a day on the present pay of infantry Second Lieutenant. Where, as in Garrison Artillery, Engineers, and Army Service Corps, regimental pay is supplemented by Armament, Engineer, or Corps pay, we propose that (as in the case of the soldier) the new overriding minimum shall apply to the sum of regimental and extra pay, thus reducing the disadvantage under which the infantry officer labours.6. The main rates of pay of the several regimental ranks in the Line Infantry now range from 7s. Qd. for the Second Lieutenant to 23s. for the Lieutenant-Colonel Within this range of 15s. Qd., room has to be found for no less than six intermediate rates (see paragraph 7) In addition to various special rates for officers from the ranks and Brevet Majors. The maximum children&apos;s allowance of SI. a month is equivalent to about 5s. 3d. el day, while the largest interval is that between Major second in command, 19s.. and Lieutenant-Colonel, 23s. It is clearly inadmissible [126] *       B
that an officer should lose income by being promoted in his.regiment, and therefore unless the children^ allowance is given to all regimental ranks alike, a difficulty arises from the fact that there is nowhere a clear interval of 5s. 3d. between suc-cessive ranks. On the other hand, to give the children&apos;s allowance to Lieutenant-Colonels or to increase their pay to give the necessary interval would in its turn produce disturbance in the rates appropriate to Colonels and Brigadier-Generals, so extending the increases to ranks that could not possibly be described as junior.7. To meet this difficulty we propose to give the children&apos;s allowance to Subalterns and Captains at the full rate, and to Majors at half rate, at the same time slightly adjusting, the pay of.these, ranks as/follows j-Bank.Present Rate.Maximum Allowance for Children.Si	d.	s.	d.7	6	10	6	6	11	612	6	13	614	6	14	616 18	0 b	J    M	019	0	19	023	0	23	0Second LieutenantLieutenantCaptainCaptain (higher rate)       ..

Ordnance officers of the 4th Class (rank, Captain) draw 22s. Qd. a day, and those of the 3rd Class (rank, Major) 26s. a day. Judged by the general Army standard, these are Lieutenant-Colonels&apos; rates and should carry.no children5s allowance; but in view of the fact that, there are rates of 25s. and 2.6s.. for Majors of Engineers and Army Medical Corps, which must carry half-children5s allowances under the general scheme, we propose to give half allowances to 3rd and 4th Class Ordnance Officers. Similarly, the pay of officers qualified, to draw 8s. a day flying pay continuously is:. Flying Officer: (Subaltern) 2Qs. to 24s., Flight Commander (Captain) 25s. to 3is., Squadron Commander (Major). 33s. &quot;We consider that only the Flymg Officer should have children5s allowance,, at half rates, the Flight Commander&apos;s initial rate being raised to 27s., to avoid loss on promotion.-.10. There are certain officers employed uhder contract at special inclusive rates of, pay&apos;,...viz.: ^Surgeons (24s. a day), Dentists (20s.), Stationery Officers (17s. Qd.). These, if employed, on a purely civilian basis, would have been entitled to receive some form of war bonus, but have had no increase of any kind. We recommend that they be granted the chilareh5s allowance at half rates... 11. For Quartermasters, whose scale in the Infantry runs from 10s. to 16s., we propose to adopt the minimum of 10s. 6^. and raise the maximum correspondingly to 16s. Qd.. Those already in receipt of this or higner ,scales to . remain as at present. As the pay rises by. regular increments. &apos;oit Is. Qd. a dav, we propose to give the full children5s allowance /throughout, notwithstanding that the Quarter-masters on the higher rates have the honorary rank of Major.New Rate.
12. For Staff. Officers on consolidated rates of;pay. and allowances we propose to give the full children&apos;s allowance up to and including the rate of 400Z. a year and half allowances:up to and including 501U a, year.13. The cost of these proposals for the Army would be about 6,500,000Z. a year; and we recommend that they should take effect from the 1st October last for the remainder of the war, as for the men.14. The foregoing recommendations should not apply to officers drawing retired pay in addition to pay.Navy.15. As regards the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, and Naval Reserve Forces, the following proposals are made: -Children&apos;s A Romances.It is proposed that all Commissioned Officers, R.N., R.M., R.N.R., and R.N.V.R. (except Commissioned Warrant-Officers) of and below the rank and relative rank of Lieutenant R.N. should, provided their age is not below 22 years, receive a children&apos;s allowance of 21. per month per child, subject to a maximum of SI. a month, and that officers of the rank or relative rank of Lieutenant-Commander should receive a children&apos;s allowance at the rate of 11. per child per month, subject to a maximum of 4Z. a month. (The age limitation of 22 years should not apply to any officer already married.)As regards graded Commissioned Officers of the R.N.A.S., it is proposed, in view of their relatively high rates of pay, to grant a children&apos;s allowance of 11. per child per month, with a maximum of 4/. a month, to officers of and below the rank of Flight Lieutenant, but no such allowance to officers above that rank. In the exceptional cases of graded officers, who are borne for &quot; ground &quot; duties, and consequently ineligible for flying pay, it is recommended that officers of and below the rank of Flight Lieutenant should receive a children&apos;s allowance on the same scale as Lieutenants R.N., and officers of the rank of Flight Commander and Squadron Commander should receive an allowance on the same scale as Lieutenant Commanders R.N. Temporary Surgeons and Surgeons R.N.V.R. should receive an allowance at half rates, as in the case of officers similarly employed in the Army.As in the case of the Army, the age limits we propose are those already in existence for allowances to children of deceased officers, viz., 18 for boys and 21 (or marriage if earlier) for girls, with extension in case of invalids.Separation A llowance.16. As regards Commissioned Warrant Officers, all of whom are promoted from warrant rank, it is considered more appropriate to grant separation allowance on the same scale and subject to the same conditions as authorised for Warrant Officers. This will in all cases obviate loss on promotion.It is proposed further that .in the cases of both Commissioned Warrant Officers and Warrant Officers the State should take over a proportion of the allotment, not exceeding 3s. Qd. a week, under the same general conditions as recently approved for Naval ratings and marines below the rank of officer.Increases of Pay.17. The Army proposal to grant to all officers a minimum rate of pay of 10s. Qd. a day could not appropriately be applied to the Naval and Marine Services Officers in the Naval Service of the rank or relative rank of Sub-Lieutenant, which corresponds to the rank of Lieutenant in the Army, are as a rule quite young and unmarried, and their present rates of pay are, therefore, sufficient.There are, however, one or two exceptions to this general statement, e.g., Sub-Lieutenants R.N.V.R. serving in the Royal Naval Division and Assistant Pay-masters R.N.V.R,    Special provision is accordingly made for them hereunder.18. The following are the proposals concerning the various ranks: Royal Navy.Midshipmen to receive 5s. a day (instead of Is. 9d. plus private allowance at the rate of 50Z. a year, such allowance being paid by the State during the war). &quot; ;, 4[128] B 2
R.N.R. and R.N.V.R.It is proposed that Officers of the R.N.R. and R.N.V.R. of the same ranks should receive the same rates of pay as Officers of the R.N., except as follows: Sub-Lieutenants R.N.V.R. serving in the R.N. Division are recruited from Army Cadets, and should therefore receive the same rate of pay as Second-Lieutenants in the Army, namely, 10s. Qd. a day.Acting Sub-Lieutenants (while-performing Midshipinen&apos;s duties). Pay of 5s. *..: :  :  a day&apos;is proposed as for Midshipmen, instead of 3s. Qd. a day plus private allowance of 20Z. per annum, such allowance being paid by the State during the war.Sub-Lieutenants. No increase is proposed, as they have recently received a rise in pay, namely, from 5s. to 7s. Qd. a day, which is considered sufficient.Mates. These officers at present receive 8s. a day plus 2s. messing allowance, and it is proposed to grant them pay of 9s. plus messing allowance of 2s. a day.Lieutenants. The rates proposed for these officers are 12s. on promotion and 13s. Qd. after four years.Lieutenant-Commanders. The rates proposed are 16s. on promotion, 17s. after four years, and 18s. after six years.Commanders and Junior Captains. It is proposed to grant rates of 23s. and 23s. did. respectively. These two proposals, which involve a rise of Is. in each rank, are consequential upon the proposed scale for Lieutenant-Commanders.Mates (E.). It is proposed that these officers should receive pay of 9s. plus messing allowance of 2s., instead of 8s. with a like messing allowance.Engineer Lieutenants. The rates proposed are 12s. on promotion and 13s. Qd. after four years, as in the case of Lieutenants of the Executive Branch.Engineer Commanders. It is proposed that these officers should receive the initial pay of the rank on promotion thereto, regardless of their length of service in the ranks of Engineer Lieutenant and Engineer Lieutenant Commander.Assistant Clerks. These officers at present receive pay of 2s. 6d. a day plus private allowance (payable by the State during the war) of 207. a year. It is proposed that in future they should receive pay of 4s. a day without private allowance.Clerks. A rise of Is. a day is proposed, which will give them a rate of 5s. aday, as in the case of Midshipmen. Paymasters-It is proposed to grant pay of 12s. on promotion and 13s. afterfour years.Staff Paymasters. It is proposed to grant 16s. on promotion, instead of 15s. as at present, in order to avoid the possibility of loss on promotion owing to the reduction of family allowance.Fleet Paymasters. For the same reason it is proposed to grant 22s. on pro-motion, instead of 21s. as at present.Staff Surgeons and Fleet Surgeons. It is proposed in the case of each of these ranks to grant a rise of Is. on promotion, making the rates 21s. and 28s. a day respectively, such rises being necessary to obviate loss on promotion due to the reduction or withdrawal of family allowance.Surgeon Probationers. It is proposed to grant pay of 7s. Qd. a day instead of 5s., the revised rate being that of Sub-Lieutenants R.N., with whom they rank.Chaplains and Naval Instructors. In order to obviate loss on the reduction or withdrawal of family allowance it is proposed to grant these officers 16s. a day after eight years&apos; service, when they hold the relative rank of Lieutenant-Commander, and 19s. after 15 years&apos; service, when they rank with Commanders. It is further proposed to grant 20s., instead of 19s.. a day after 21 years&apos; service, in view of the long period that the officers would otherwise have to serve on one and the same rate of pay namely, 19s.
Assistant Paymasters R.N..V.R., who, like Assistant Paymasters,R.N,.Jt at present receive U day; sfiotild in future receive 10s. a Say;, as Assistant Pay-masters R.N.R. do already. The reason for granting these Reserve officers a higher rate of pay than officers in the R.N. is that they are as a rule of considerably greater-age....Temporary Lieutenant-CqmWah^er^ &apos;R;N.R. and,,&apos;R.N,V.R. who have not the same service as permanent officers of the same rank in the R.N.R.N.A.S..Flight Commanders.-hi order to obviate loss on promotion owing to the withdrawal of children&apos;s allowance it is proposed to grant pay of 19s. on promotion, instead of 17s. as at present.Royal Marines (Permanent Service).Quartermasters. Quartermasters R.M.L.I. are at present on a scale of 10s. to 16s. a day. It is proposed to grant a rise of Qd. a day throughout the scale, which will then become 10s. w: to 16s. Qd., according to length of commis-sioned service. It is proposed further that these officers, even when holding the rank of Major (i.e., the relative rank of Lieutenant-Commander in the R.N.), or higher rank, should not suffer the usual reduction of one-half in family allowance.It. is considered that Probationary Second.Lieutenants oh entry should receive a. uniform grant of 501. a -year. A corresponding grant is made to Army officers on entry.Lieutenants. It is proposed three years after entry to grant pay of 12s. a day as.has been proposed for other officers of the R.N. on attaining Ward Room rank.Second Lieutenants promoted from the ranks. It is proposed to grant pay of 10s. 6$. a day, and 11s. Qd. a day on promotion to Lieutenant, as in the case of the Army.Captains. The rates proposed are 13s. 6*1 on promotion, 14s. after one year. As regards officers who entered the R.M. before the 1st January, 1912, and who are paid on a different scale from those subsequently entered, it is proposed to grant the following rates : Captains R.M.......      13s. Qd. on promotion and 14s. afterthree years.Majors R.M.    ......      18s. on promotion and 19s. after sixyears.Royal Marines (Temporary Service).As these officers are virtually Army officers, it is proposed for each rank to adopt the Army rate, namely: Second Lieutenant       ......      ...      ...      10s. Qd. a day.Lieutenant        ...............      11s. Qd.    ,,Captain ...............      13s. Qd.   ,,19. As in the case of the Army, for Staff officers on consolidated rates of pay and allowances we propose to give the full children&apos;s allowance up to and including the rate of 400 . a year and half allowances up to and including 5001. a year.General.20. It is considered that all the proposals should have effect from the 1st October, 1917, that being the date from which the concessions, recently granted to men of the two services as the result of the decision of the War Cabinet, have had effect, and further, that, as in the case of the men, the concessions above recom-mended should be for the period of the war. An attempt has been made throughout to secure that the concessions to the ranks in the Navy shall be, as nearly as possible -in the circumstances of the Service, equivalent to the concessions made to the corresponding ranks in the Army.
Cost.21. The annual cost of these concessions is estimated for the first year at about 850,000*. as follows:- J Increases of pay ...............      325,000Family allowance to Commissioned Officers......     442,000Separation allowance and allotment concessions toCommissioned Warrant Officers ...      ......       33,000Allotment concession to Warrant Officers    ......       5o&apos;oOOTotal......       850,000The Pay of Captains R.N.22. The scheme submitted to us by the Board of Admiralty, with the unanimoussupport of the Board behind it, involved certain proposed additions to the pay of Captains R.N. (as well as to certain officers of relative rank in other branches) beyond the increase of Is. a day which we recommend for Junior Captains. We have not felt entitled to consider these on their merits, inasmuch as our reference from the War Cabinet confined our consideration to the problem of the pay of the junior officers.We nevertheless call attention to the fact that the Board of Admiralty lay great stress upon the necessity to review the whole scale of Captains&apos; pay. It is pointed out that the scale has not been improved during the last fifty years. In that time, of course, the responsibility of the officer in command of one of His Majesty&apos;s ships of war has enormously increased, and the scientific and technical attainments necessary in the holding of the office have been very materially raised indeed.In illustration of this fact it is only necessary to recall the measure of responsibility attaching to the captaincy of one of the latest battleships, the material value alone of which reaches a figure between two and three millions of money.EDWARD CARSON,Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.
