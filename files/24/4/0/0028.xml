[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for ihe War Cabinet.   December 1917.SECRET. G.-177.COMMERCIAL TREATIES.Interim Report No. 6 of a Committee Appointed by the War Cabinet to Consider the Question oe an Economic Offensive.[Previous Papers Nos. G.-1.56, 158, 159, 160, 161, 166, 167, 168, 170, 175, and War Cabinet 247 (8), 265 (18) and (19), 273 (16), and 278 (17).]1. THE attention of this Committee has been drawn to the Interim Report on Commercial Treaties presented to the War Cabinet by the Imperial Trade Policy Committee. That Report points out that the most-favoured-nation clauses of our commercial treaties have in practice been suspended during the war, for very cogent reasons, with respect not only to neutral but also to Allied countries, and that the same reasons will require us to pursue a similar policy during the period of reconstruction after the war. In view of this, it recommends the issue to our Allies and neutrals of a declaration making clear our intentions in this respect.2. This Committee, in the course of its survey of the economic situation which will arise at the end of the war, has become clearly convinced of the necessity of comprehensive and far-reaching measures for the organisation of the acquisition and distribution of the supplies of raw materials, and of the instruments of production and transportation in the interests of the Allies, and for the effective control, to this end, of exports and imports by the Governments of the British Empire and its Allies. These measures will obviously involve a selective treatment in the distribution, or rationing, of raw materials to different countries, Allied or neutral, in accordance with their needs or claims upon us. As an illustration, it is only necessary to point to the case of Belgium. What applies to raw materials will apply in varying degrees, according to the particular cases, to the export of ships, rolling stock or machinery, to shipping and bunker-coal facilities, to the export of capital, and to the regulation of imports.. 3. Such a selective - treatment according to the merits of each specific case isr however, precluded if the existing most-favoured-nation clauses in our commercial treaties are allowed to hold good during the period of reconstruction. Moreover, the literal enforcement of these clauses in the case of certain neutral countries would enable Germany to make use of those neutral countries as a means of defeating any economic measures the Allies may be compelled to take against German trade at the end of the war.4. These considerations make it essential, from the point of view of this Committee, as well as from that of the Committee on Imperial Trade Policy, that the recommenda-tions of the latter on this point should be adopted. Further, we consider it of great importance, from the point of view both of making the enemy realise the future danger to him of prolonging the war and of the actual peace negotiations, that the suggested declaration should be issued with the least possible delay.5. The attention of the Committee has also been drawn to the state of opinion in the House of Commons.   There is evidently great uneasiness in many quarters as to what the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government really is; criticism of, and even opposition to, the Non-ferrous Metals Bill and the Imports and Exports Temporary [1241]
Control Bill is becoming organised, not because there is any real hostility in the House, except among a very small group, to the measures introduced when they are regarded in the light of the abnormal conditions which will prevail in the period of reconstruction, but because the strongest supporters of a decisive policy do not know up to the present what action the Government propose to take in regard to most-favoured-nation treaties. It is, in fact, being represented in some quarters that the Imports and Exports Temporary Control Bill is being brought forward merely as a means of continuing the war regime for a few months, leaving the way open for more or less unrestricted trade with enemy countries as soon as this brief transitional period is over(Signed)        EDWARD CARSON (Chairman).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 6, 1917. ^
