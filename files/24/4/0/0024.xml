i      /. .[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.5ECRET.IN.S.R. 22. G. 174.Iproblem of the maintenance of the armedFORCES.Memorandum by the Minister of National Service.0THE Army Council have lodged a demand for the following numberf Category &quot;A&quot; Recruits (before the 30th June, 1918) ...         ... 600,000I am informed that in addition they have organised the Home,Defence Force on the basis of receiving yearly as lads of 18         ... 240,000The demand for lower Category men (Army and Air Force) mayamount to as much as ...         ...         ...         ...          ...          ... 320,000The Navy&apos;s requirements, including an allowance for R.N..A.S. are 90,0001,250,000The probable total demand therefore is for 1,250,000 men to be withdrawn from : life in twelve months.The ruling of the War Cabinet is therefore requested on the following points: 1. Are the maintenance of the Navy and Army, as they exist to-day, and the authorised expansions in personnel in the Royal Navy, Royal Naval Air Service, Royal Flying Corps, Royal Artillery, Machine Gun Corps, and the Tank Corps, to be given absolute priority over all other demands for man power?2. If not, are Naval requirements in enrolled personnel to be given absolutepriority over all other demands for man power? 3. If the answer to question 1 is in the negative, what proportion of the Army requirements is to be given priority over all industrial demands, includ-ing shipbuilding, food production, and munitions output? 4. If a given proportion of the Army requirements is to be given priority over all industrial demands, what industrial requirements are to be given priority over the balance of Army requirements? 5. If the number of men allocated to the Armed Forces by the War Cabinet be greater than can be obtained without endangering essential industries, under existing legal powers, what modifications of, or additions to the existing powers will the War Cabinet approve?It is appreciated that the answers to these questions must depend upon the -ordinated strategy of this country and her Allies. But assuming that we have to face*a prolonged war, I feel bound to state that, after full consideration of all the available facts and statistics, it will, in my opinion, be impossible to meet the demands of the Navy and Army further than is proposed in the following suggested answers. Moreover, if it be the considered policy of the Allies to draw on the resources of this country for munitions rather than for men, the number of men available for the Armed Forces must be further reduced.Subject to the above observations and to provide a definite basis of discussion, I &amp;ave to make the following submissions : 1. That the answer to question 1 must necessarily be in the negative. 2. That the answer to question 2 should be in the affirmative. [1180] Bico
3. That, in answer to question 3, the following proportion of the Army demands should be regarded as a first charge on the national resources of Man Power: (a.) One-third of the Army demand for Category &quot;A&quot; recruits (i.e., 200,000 Category &quot;A&quot; recruits, who will become available for drafts before 30th September, 1918).(&amp;.) One-third of the anticipated demand for lower categorv men (say, 100,000).(c.) A further number of Category &quot;A &quot; recruits equal to the number of Category &quot; A &quot; men withdrawn from the colours for industry between now and the 30th September, 1918.4. That, in answer to 4, it be referred to the War Priorities Committee to deter-mine from time to time what portions of the industrial programmes of Government Departments are to be given priority over the balance of Army requirements.5. In answer to question 5, that, if the political situation precludes the exten-sion of compulsory military service to Ireland, the age for service over-seas be lowered from 19 years to 18 years 6 months; and that the military age be raised to 45 with power by Order in Council to raise it to 50.The numbers proposed to be allotted to the Forces in the suggested answers to questions 2 and 3 are largely in excess of the numbers which can be raised under existing legal powers.The effect upon labour supply of adopting the suggested priority for personnel of the Navy and Army, so far as it is believed it can be met within the present age limits, is shown in Table A attached.The foregoing submissions are based upon the following review of the man power situation: Review of Situation.The review of the recruiting position (N.S.R. 17) which I submitted on the 13th October at the request of the War Cabinet was based upon the requirements of and rate of wastage in the Armies overseas during the past year. The Army Council and Sir Douglas Plaig had not at that time formulated specific demands for the coming year. This they have now done. Copies of their letters (Appendices I and II) are attached.The Army Council in their letter of 6th November (Appendix I) put forward the following demands for Category &quot; A &quot; recruits, to be sent overseas up to the 31st October, 1918, to maintain the Armies in all theatres of war: Category &quot; A &quot; Recruits over 18 years 8 months required in presentmonth      ...... ... ... ... ... ...   250,000Category &quot;A&quot; Recruits over 18 years 8 months required monthly from December 1917 to June 1918, both inclusive, at the rate of 50,000 per month      ... ... ... ... ...-350J000Total      ...    600,000It is understood that in addition to the 600,000 men who would become available for drafts during the period under review, the Army Council are also counting on a normal intake of younger &quot;A 4&quot; boys, who would become available for service over-seas after the 31st October, 1918.The requirements contained in Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s letter of the 2nd November (Appendix II) may be summarised as follows: Required by the 31st March: Infantry ... ... ... ... ... ...   355,100Artillery ..................    45,300New Units (Artillery, Survey Companys, &amp;c.)        ... ...    36,000Total required by the 31st March      ... ... ... ...   436,400Add 68,600 per month for all arms for the ensuing six months, i.e. ...   411,600Total estimated requirements for France, fully trained Categorv&quot;A&quot; men up to the 30th September, 1918 ... ... ...   848,000
It will be seen that Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s letter is a demand for reinforcements for the Armies in France, which must be met from one of two sources: 1. Men now in the Army, including fully trained men, recruits, and sick and wounded men who will become fit for general service.2. New recruits who will be drafted into the Army and will become fully trained and available for drafts before the 30th September, 1918.The Army Council letter is a comprehensive demand for new recruits who will become fully trained and available for drafts before the 31st October, 1918.In order that the War Cabinet may be in a position to review the situation completely, I think it is essential that they should know two things: (i.) The total number of Category &quot; A &quot; men whom it will be necessary to send overseas between the present date and the 30th September, 1918, if the Armies in the field are to secure the proposed expansion of given arms in accordance with the present programme, and are to be maintained at full strength during the period under review. This is estimated at 1,144,000.(ii.) The number of Category &quot; A &quot; Recruits whom it will be necessary to have in the Training Reserve on the 30th September, 1918, training for service overseas.   This is estimated at 160,000.The estimated requirements under (i.) and (ii.) are deduced as follows: (i.)Estimated reinforcements for the Army in France, based upon SirDouglas Haig&apos;s letter      ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 848,000Estimated reinforcements for other theatres of War      ...         ... 192,000New units other than those provided for in Sir Douglas Haig&apos;sestimate         &apos;  ...         ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 84,000Required to replace Category &quot; A &quot; men returned to civil life    ... 20,0001,144,000(ii.)The estimated drafts for all arms and all theatres of war to be sent overseas during October, November, and December, 1918, and January 1919, will be, say ... ... ... ...   280,000Returned Expeditionary Force men becoming fit again for generalservice during these four months will be, say ... ...   140,000Required to be in training on the 1st October, 1918      ... ...   140,000Of this total of 140,000, however, say 40,000 will consist of &quot;A 4&quot; youths becoming available during the four months in question (assuming the present intake of 10,000 per month is maintained). These youths, however, require six months&apos; training; so that it is essential that there should be an adequate) number in hand in a sufficiently advanced state of training to be ready for drafts after the four months in question. It is therefore suggested that 20,000 (i.e., a further 2 months&apos; supply) be added to the 140,000 mentioned above, making a total Training Reserve of 160,000.Our total liabilities in Category &quot; A &quot; men for immediate and prospective service overseas for the period under review, i.e., to the 30th September, 1918, is, therefore, 1,304,000.Heavy demands for Category &quot; A &quot; men will also be made for the Navy and Royal Naval Air Service, amounting, it is estimated, to 90,000 men between now and the 30th September, 1918.To expand and maintain the forces for twelve months the total number of Category &quot; A &quot;. men required should, therefore, be placed at 1,394,000.As will be shown later, more than half of these liabilities will be met by the Army itself out of trained men and recruits now in the Forces at home, and out of sick and wounded men, who will become fit for general service during the period under review.Very large numbers of lower category men are also required for auxiliary services. Sir Douglas Haig places these requirements, so far as his Armies are concerned, &quot; as heretofore.&quot; Increased demands are expected both for the R.F.C. and for the R.N.A.S. It has not yet been possible to obtain the estimates in detail, but
it would be unsafe to put the total requirements of the Services for lower category-men for the period ending the 30th September,. 1918, at less than 320,000. To raise this number of lower category men involves nearly doubling the present average monthly intake of lower category men.The supply of lower category men is not exhausted; but it must be borne in mind that every lower category man taken into the Army reduces the pool for replacing Category &quot; A &quot; men more urgently required.The demands for Category &quot;A&quot; men are so large, that I am satisfied it is impossible to meet even a considerable percentage of these demands if more than the normal levy of lower category men is taken from civil life.I therefore strongly urge that any requirement for lower category men in excess of the present levy of 10,000 a month should be met from within the Army itself.There are at present in the Forces at Home upwards of 500,000 men in Categories &quot;B &quot; and &quot; C.&quot; I submit that the number of these men herd in the Forces at Home is excessive in proportion to our human resources.Lastly, before passing from the question of the lower category men, I would ask the Cabinet and the Army Council to consider whether it is not possible to employ garrison battalions to hold some of the quieter parts of the line in France, at any rate during the winter months.It is necessary now to consider how far the demand for Category &quot; A &quot; men can be met. In doing so, it is assumed that the proposals with regard to finding within the Army itself the majority of men of lower category required will be approved.   The inquiry, therefore, falls into two parts: 1. How far the demand can be met without recourse to further legislation. 2. What extension of existing legislation will be necessary to make up the defficiency.Before considering the Category &quot; A &quot; men still in civil life, it will be con-venient to review the number of Category &quot; A &quot; men now in the Army who can be made available for reinforcements.   These men fall into the following classes: 1. &quot; A 1 &quot; men who should be immediately available.2. &quot; A 2 &quot; recruits now in training who should become available within the nextthree or four months. 3. &quot; A 4 &quot; youths now in training who will become available for drafts beforethe 30th September, 1918. 4. Wounded and invalided men who will become fit for general service andavailable for drafts before the 30th Seotember, 1918.According to the printed weekly return of the British Army at Home, the numbers under headings 1, 2, and 3, were on the 1st October, 1917, as follows : 1.............      192,0002.............      124,0003.174,000Total......      ...      490,000In addition to these numbers there are also men on the permanent cadre (a large proportion of whom are category &quot; A &quot;) totalling over 90,000, who are treated as not available for drafts. In view of the extreme seriousness of the situation, and the impossibility of meeting the full demands of the Army for Category &quot;A&quot; men, I submit that, out of the total of 90,000 men, the Army Council should be urged to render at least 30,000 available for reinforcements.The above total of 490,000 is stated by the War Office to include the following : Engaged in Munitions ............      16,00040,000Skilled Tradesmen        ......CadetsIn Dock and Transport Battalions In Home Service Units   ......23,000 4,000 30,000113,000The 40,000 Skilled Tradesmen are available for drafting to skilled occupations in the various services.The Category &quot; A &quot; men in Dock and Transport Battalions should, I submit, be treated as available for drafts.
The number of Category &quot; A &quot; men ruled by the General Staff to be necessarily retained for Home Defence this time last year was 12,000. In view of the urgency of the present situation, I submit that this number should not be exceeded, and that 18,000 of the 30,000 Category &quot; A&quot; men in Home Service units should be made available for drafts.Classes 1, 2, and 3, should yield, therefore, a total of 469,000 Category &quot; A &quot; men, of whom 40,000 are said to be skilled tradesman, and, therefore, not available for infantry drafts.From this must be deducted the estimated wastage at home. The Army Council, I understand, estimate the gross wastage at 10 per cent. This does not take credit for men of lower categories improving in physique and becoming Category &quot; A.&quot;Allowing this credit, I think it is reasonable to place the estimated wastage at 20,000, which give a total available of 449,000.4. Wounded and invalided men becoming fit again for general service.In my review of the recruiting position, N.S.R.-17, I estimated this number at 356,000. These figures were based on the results of very careful and detailed investigations made in connection with three well defined blocks of casualties, both of sick and wounded, in various arms (see Appendix I of N.S.R.-17). It is, of course, extremely difficult to predicate how far past experience can be relied, on in such cases. As the length of the war and its strain increase, the recuperative power of those who have been engaged in it for any long period necessarily diminishes. There is also a psychological factor to be considered. It will probably, therefore, be safer to estimate the number of returned sick and wounded at 300,000.Upon these estimates, classes 1, 2, 3, and 4 give a total of 749,000 Category &quot; A &quot; men now in the Army, and available for reinforcements in the period under review. Of these, however, 40,000 appear not to be available for infantry drafts. This leaves a balance of. 555,000 Category &quot; A &quot; men to be found from civil life for the Army, plus 90,000 for the Navy, a total of 645,000.It will be seen from Table A that the total number of Category &quot; A &quot; men of military age in civil life is about 950,000. These are for the most part engaged in essential industries.In the ordinary working of the recruiting machine, and given that all necessary negotiations with the Trade Unions are carried out satisfactorily, that the fullest possible use is made of all labour, that female labour is introduced to the fullest possible extent, and that release from the Colours of low category men is carried out to the fullest extent, I had estimated that it would be possible to obtain a further 270,000 Category &quot; A &quot; men over 18 years and 8 months before the 30th September, 1918, if the lads under that age luere left in civil life. This estimate when made, did not take into account the increased demands for munitions which have arisen to meet requirements in Italy. It did not take into account any proposal that we should supply the United States Army with munitions to an appreciable extent. It did not take into account the increased demands for low category men, which, as stated above, I am led to believe are likely to be in excess of what was originally anticipated.In view of the fact that the recruiting of youths under 18 years 8 months has not been stopped, of the changes in the circumstances of our industrial position, and of the progress of recruiting in the meantime, the maximum number of Category &quot;A&quot; Recruits wmich can be obtained under existing legal powers before the 30th September, 1918, without depleting essential industries below the danger point, cannot, I think, exceed 150,000. This maximum number can only be obtained if strict rulings are given by the War Priorities Committee as to the order in which new undertakings are to be embarked upon, particularly in relation to construction work, and as to the postponement of less essential portions of existing programmes. It is also only fair to say that it assumes that a larger number of men can be released from munitions than the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions. are now prepared to accept, though below the number actually directed by the War Cabinet, after consideration of Lord Rhondda&apos;s report. (Reference G.T.-336 and War Cabinet Minutes No. 103, Appendix &quot; A &quot;; and No. 108, Minute 1.)It is obviously impossible for the War Cabinet to come to a decision on the Army CounciTs demands, without considering the actual and prospective demands for labour reinforcements for1 Government work, which have been made or are likely to be put forward, by. Government Departments during the period under review.The actual outstanding demands can be stated with practical certainty.   The prospective demands are much less definite.; but they are the nearest estimates which&apos; [1180] C
the Departments are able to present at the moment. Every effort is being made to reduce those demands into as final and definite a form as possible: and a further and more detailed report will be made as soon as this has been done. But it must be borne in mind that, while army requirements in men can be stated with a near degree of certainty, demands for labour for Government work depend on rulings as to priority and on supply of materials, the former of which must vary with the exigen-cies of the military situation, and the latter with the tonnage which comes to port and the internal labour situation.(A.) Actual Outstanding Demands.The actual outstanding demands for labour at the present moment (that is to say the number of vacancies notified in respect of men who can be taken on immediately), is approximately 67,000 for Government work of all kinds. These vacancies have been graded by the Priority Committee as follows: Priority 1 ... ...... 11,600*Priority 2 ... ...         ...    1,300Priority 3  (List 1) ...         ...    6,600Others&quot;   ... ... ...         ... 47,500Total     ... ...   67,000The vacancies granted Priority 1 and 2 are divided roughly into the following proportions: Admiralty ... ... ...    4,300Ministry of Munitions      ... ...    5,000War Office ... ... ...    3,000Office of Works    .........      600It is probable that the total figure of 67,000 is considerably below the mark, inasmuch as employers of labour, knowing that their demands cannot be met in full, do not trouble to notify them all.It is certain that a considerable proportion of the demands of labour, which are referred to below as &quot;prospective demands &quot; are really demands which could absorb men at once; but for reasons stated above they have not been formally notified.   This certainly applies to the agricultural demand of 17,000 men.(B.) Prospective Demands. As regards the prospective demands the position apears to be as follows: The Ministry of Munitions&apos; demand up to the end of October 1918 is for approximately 80,500 men.   The details are as follows: MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS. Additional Male Labour required up to the end of October 1918.	Skilled.	Unskilled.1. Ordnance.. 2. Ammunition 3. Explosives and chemicals 4. T.

This table takes no account of the increased drain on industries, such as tool-making, which the general expansion of programme will entail. No estimate can be formed of the additional labour which will be required for such things as tool-making and general factory equipment.)
The main Admiralty demand falls into three categories: (a.) Merchant Shipbuilding (including new shipyard construction). (&amp;.) Warship Building.(c.) Department of Contractor of Works Constructional Labour.As regards (a) Merchant Shipbuilding, &amp;c, the Admiralty base their require-ments on an annual output of 3,000,000 tons of shipping; and for this they will require, by the middle of 1918, 12,500 additional skilled men and 67,500 additional unskilled men.The ability to use these men depends upon weekly deliveries of 36,000 tons of steel. It is understood that the present deliveries are about 18,000 tons; but it has been intimated that deliveries will probably increase by about 1,500 tons a month until they reach the figure of 36,000.*As regards (&amp;) Warship Building, the Admiralty can only make a very rough estimate; but on a basis of 25 per cent, increase of programme, which they inform me has been agreed to, they will require 20,000 men.As regards (c) Constructional Buliding Labour, the ascertainable prospective demands are about 3,000 during the next six months. If, however, a programme of increased aircraft production and dockyard extension (which is under considera-tion) is agreed to, the requirements would be increased by 15,000-20,000 men.In addition to the above, the Controller of Armament Production requires an additional number of 2,000 men for the extension of subsidised firms producing guns, gun ammunition, &amp;c. A further 1,000 men are also asked for for Airship construction.The Board of Trade Timber Controller estimates his requirements next year at some 17,000 men for the purpose of obtaining the necessary output of sawn timber and pit wood without drawing on existing stocks. This is contingent upon his being able to import 300,000 standards of sawn wood, and 400,000 tons of pit wood and pit props; and unless he is able to secure this importation the labour requirements will be higher.The Road Board estimate their requirements at 4,500, all of whom, they state, will be wanted during the next three or four months.A very important demand also is that for Gas Works, where in order to obtain the necessary output for the winter an increase of some 2,000 men at least will be necessary.The War Office for the purpose of Aerodrome construction estimate tjieir prospective requirements at 22,000, of whom 12,000 will be required immediately, and 10,000 in the course of the next few months.The Office of Works require for the Grain Stores to be erected for the Ministry of Food and other works of construction under their control approximately 5,000 additional men, and estimate that they will require a further 6,400 for other con-structional work in the course of the next six months.The Board of Agriculture need 17,000 men, 50 per cent, of whom are to be skilled (including 2,000 skilled ploughmen). These men have all been promised by the Army, but have not, I am informed, yet been obtained.The use of the unskilled men will depend very largely on their being able to get the skilled ploughmen. In addition to this they will require some 24,000 workers up to next August, mainly for seasonal requirements, e.g., cleaning, harvesting, and also for training as ploughmen, &amp;c. Of this 24,000 some 8,000 must be men and will be permanently required. The balance of 16,000 for seasonal requirements could be met largely by the increased use of women, schoolboys, part-time labour, and other labour temporarily loaned. The figures, however, purport to be additional to labour of this description used last year. This means a demand for anything &apos; up to 18,000 whole-time workers. Further demands amounting possibly to an additional 40,000 men are foreshadowed, if the 1918 Food Production Programme is to be carried out.* The above estimate of steel deliveries is that received from the Admiralty. It does not tally with the figure in Mr. Ghurchill&apos;s Munition Budget, of which he has sent me a draft; but Mr. Churchill gives the same estimate of their requirements in men, i.e., 12,500 (isd 67,500.
The above prospective demands, amounting in all to 294,550, are summarised in the following table:-        -FIGURES OF PROSPECTIVE DEMAND FOR LABOUR IN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Department.Number.Period.Ministry of Munitions Admiralty Merchant ShipbuildingWarship buildingDirector, of WorksArmament production Dockyard labouiers Airship construction..

Possible.By end of February 1918.At once.By end of January 1918. At once.There will in addition&apos;be demands from other Departments, which will require consideration,, but which will not be on the same scale.The above demands for labour have, so far as the greater part of the prospective demand is concerned, only just been received, and they are necessarily put forward at their face value. Although the demands almost &quot;certainly will be reduced in some cases by rulings of the War Priorities Committee directing the discontinuance or postponement of certain work, particularly in relation to constructional work, and although it is. anticipated that some part of the demands which remain will be met by readjustments in the use of existing labour under the control of the Departments concerned, and by the absorption of labour now employed on contracts which are nearing completion, it is certain that a very large demand will remain to be met by the transfer of men from unessential or less essential industries, by the release from the Army of as many men as possible in the Forces at home not required for military purposes, and by the assistance of military units necessarily kept mobilised for military purposes, but whose labour can, consistently with their military duties, be made available for the construction of military works, and also in places in which civilian labour cannot be obtained.From the above review of the industrial position it is clear that there is no margin of men available to be freely drawn on for service with the Forces, and that even if the number of 150,000 suggested in Table A &quot; be recruited, and if the demands of the Navy for 90,000 men are given priority over the demands of the Army,within the limits of our existing powers there must be a deficit of at least 140,000 Category &quot; A &quot; men on the proportion (200,000) of the Army demand which, it is suggested, should be granted priority, and a deficit of 540,000 on the Army Council&apos;s demand for 600,000 Category &quot;A 2 &quot; men.It remains to consider what legislative changes it will be necessary to introduce if this deficiency is to be met; and I therefore submit for the consideration of the War Cabinet certain, proposals, giving as far as possible an estimate of the numbers of men, which they would respectively produce.It is essential that any legislative changes which affect men within the present limits of military age should be expressly stated to apply to voluntarily attested men as well as to men who are covered bv the Militarv Service Acts.1. Power to send Overseas Youths under 19 years of age.Upwards of 360,000 youths attain the age of 18 each year, of whom approxi-mately 270,000 are Category &quot;A.&quot; Under existing conditions about 120,000 of these 270,000 are enlisted in the Army in the course of the year.The lowering of the age for sending youths overseas would have two advantages. It would advance the date at which youths between 18 and 19 could be sent as
reinforcements; and, as these youths are now recruited at 18, they are practically fully trained by the time they reach the age of 18 years 6 months.   It would also add  . an appreciable number to the men who can be made available for reinforcements in the course of the period under review.  -Thus if the youths are sent overseas at the age of 18 years 8 months, the total available for reinforcements would be increased by 40,000. If they are sent overseas at 18.6 the increase would be 60,000. If they are sent overseas at 18.0 the increase would be 120,000.To give effect to the above proposals legislation, if not strictly necessary, would probably be advisable, as Section 1 (1) of the Military Service Acts, 1916 (Session 2) provides that &quot;steps shall be taken to prevent as far as possible the sending of men abroad before they attain the age of 19.&quot;2. Lowering the Military Age.The sending abroad of men under the age of 18 years 6 months would necessarily involve lowering the military age from 18 to 17 (or at any rate to 17 years 6 months). This would clearly be necessary in order to.ensure that youths under 18 years 6 months secure the necessary military and physical training before proceeding over-seas.    The lowering of the military age to 17 years would give 120,000 boys.3. The Raising of the Military Age to 45, together with power by Order in Council to raise the A ge to 50.Raising the age-limit to 45 would bring within the scope of the Military Service Acts 500,000 men. There are no actual data available of the standards of medical fitness above the present limits of military age. The estimates of Category &quot; A &quot; men given are based on the figures available for men from 35 to 41, but allow for a progressive diminution of physical fitness. On this assumption it is estimated that approximately 150,000 out of the 500,000 men wTould be in Category &quot;A &quot;; and. of these it is estimated that in the altered circumstances 50,000 could be made available for military service.The extension of the age-limit to 50 would bring within the scope of the Military Service Acts a further 1,000,000 men. It is estimated that 250,000 of these would be Category &quot; A,&quot; 60,000 of whom could be made available for military service.Raising the military age would also simplify to some extent the very difficult problem of the supply of doctors, not only for the Forces, but also to meet the needs of the civil population.4. The A bolition of the two months and two weeks periods of grace automatically added to exemptions.At present the provisions of the Military Service Act afford an automatic addition of two months in some cases and two weeks in others, to exemptions from military service. Any man who before the 15th August, 1915, was engaged in a certified occupation which was subject to the provisions of the Munitions of War Act. and who is in possession of a certificate of exemption granted under the Military Service Acts, cannot be made available for military service for two months after the date of the expiration or withdrawal of his certificate of exemption. Further, every man holding a tribunal exemption has two weeks after its expiration in which to apply for the renewal of the certificate, and cannot be called up during that period.The entry of such men into the Army would be accelerated, and the number of men made available would probably be increased to an appreciable extent if these periods of grace were abolished, and if it weresmade obligatory that an application for renewal of exemption should be made   ;\(a.) where the exemption is to a date specified at least fourteen days before the date of expiration;(b.) where the exemption is conditional on the fulfilment of certain conditions before the condition is broken.5. Limitation of the Power of Tribunals.The War Cabinet are already aware that the standards applied by tribunals vary considerably, and that a considerable number of men are kept out of the Army who would be enlisted if a uniform standard, such as that followed by the stricter tribunals, were universally enforced.[1180] D
Some such system as the following would, I submit, obviate this inequality of decision : The functions of tribunals should be limited to finding facts, and to granting exemptions upon the facts so found in accordance with standardised rules.Exemption should only be obtainable upon the grounds - of occupation or compassion.No exemption on grounds of financial hardship should be permitted. The individual should, if necessary, be compensated for his loss and taken for the Army.The regulations as to exemption might be : (1.) Regulations for Exemption on Occupational Grounds. All essential industries should be strictly classified. Conditions should be laid down for each such industry, on the lines of the Schedule of Protected Occupa-tions, i.e., as to the necessity of having entered such occupation before a given date, and the age below which men engaged in any such occupation will not be exempted.(2.) Regulatons for Exemption on Compassionate Grounds. Clearly defined classes of persons who could obtain exemption should also be laid down, e.g., the last surviving son of a widowed mother, where at least one son has fallen.in action, should be exempt.With clear and defined regulations laid down on the foregoing lines, tribunals would be limited to ascertaining matters of fact, such, as : in an occupational claim, whether, the applicant is or is not employed in a certain occupation, and does or does not fulfil the conditions laid down which entitle him to exemption in that occupation; and in the case of a compassionate claim, whether the applicant comes into one of the classes under which he would be entitled to exemption.Once these facts are found by the tribunal, the applicant automatically would obtain or fail to obtain exemption. The conditions entitling a man to exemption could be altered from time to time in conformity with the exigencies of the military situation and the needs of civil industry.It is not possible to give any accurate estimate of the number of men who would be affected.6. Power to Cancel Occupational Exemptions.New legal power by regulation under the Defence of the Realm Act to cancel all exemptions granted by tribunals on occupational grounds to men engaged in occupations not declared by the War Cabinet to be of national importance, and within age limits specified by the War Cabinet, without the holder of such exemption having any right of application to a tribunal for further exemption on occupational grounds.Such legislation would affect about 200,000 men, of whom probably 70,000 are Category &quot;A.&quot; It is, however, impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the number of men who could be made available in this way for military service without knowing more precisely how far essential trades are to be cut down. The difficulty of making any calculation is further aggravated by the uncertainty as to the extent and effect of action by tribunals dealing on personal grounds with men whose certificates of exemption on occupational grounds were cancelled.7. The Extension of Compulsory Service to Ireland.As already pointed out in my memorandum N.S.R. 17, the extension of com-pulsory military service to Ireland would, it is estimated, vield 150,000 Category &quot;A&quot; men, without endangering food production or injuriously affecting any essen-tial industry. If the military age were raised to 45, this number would, it is estimated, be increased to 175,000; and if the military age were raised to 50 the estimated number would be further increased to 200,000.The extension of compulsory military service to Ireland would not only produce a large number of men for the&apos;Army; it would also ease the industrial situation. Ireland is by far the largest potential labour pool; but there is at present great diffi-culty in exploiting it to the fullest advantage. &apos; In the first place, many Irishmen
decline to undertake work in Great Britain through fear of becoming liable for military service if they leave their own country. Secondly, in many cases where Irish labour has been introduced, it has led to trouble owing to the refusal of English, workers to work alongside of men whom they regarded as shirkers.In order to secure the necessary efficiency in the recruiting machine to enable the above proposals to be administered and the men required to be raised, a more complete system of registration than the present is essential. On this matter I am already in touch with the Local Government Board.To improve the present system of registration, it will be necessary to make the following changes of legislative or administrative action : (1.) Compulsory notification of changes of occupation for men at present regis-tered under the Act who are still in civil life. (2.) Compulsory registration of all males who have attained the age of 15 sincethe Act came into force, and for those who attain that age in the future. (3.) Compulsory registration of. all men who are discharged from the ArmedForces of the Crown as and when they re-enter civil life, and of those whohave already been discharged. (4.) Powers making it obligatory for all males between the prescribed ages tocarry their registration certificates, which should in all cases be signed bythe holder, and to produce these certificates for inspection when calledupon to do so by the police or other proper authority. (5.) Reduction of the period of 28 days for notification of removal to 7 days. (6.) The upkeep of the residential and occupational particulars of the NationalRegister should be continued by the local authorities, who should adviseall changes, by means of Form N.R. 35, to the Ministry of National - Service as at present, but the Form should contain  the  additionaloccupational particulars now required. (7.) Particulars of all male persons between the ages of 41 and 65 as on August15, 1916, should be supplied by the local authorities to the Ministry ofNational Service.(8.) As an immediate measure, all those at present in possession of registration cards should be required to surrender them, receiving in exchange a new certificate which would show the man&apos;s occupation and place of residence at the present time.This would afford a valuable check on the information at present at the disposal of the Ministry of National Service regarding men of military age who are still in civil life. Pending definite action on No. 1, this would also, for the time being, meet the urgent need for fuller and more accurate information as to changes of occupation.Table &quot; B &quot; attached gives in statistical form a- general view of the position.A. C. GEDDES.November 15th, 1917.APPENDIX I.Sir R. W. Brade to Director-General of National Service. 121/France/45 (A.G. 2).Sir, , War Office, November, 6, 1917.I am commanded by the Army Council to forward the attached copy of a letter which has been addressed to the Field-Marshal Commander-in-Chief of the British Armies in France relative to the prospects of maintaining the present Forces in the Field during the year 1918.2. The figures on which the forecast has been based have already been scrutinised and agreed to by you, and it is clear that with the number of recruits anticipated in your memorandum N.S.R. 17, dated the 13th October, 1917, as becoming available for the Army during the period of the 1st October, 1917, to the 30th June, 1918, it will be impossible to maintain the Forces in the Field at their present establishment.3. I am to point out that owing to the number of recruits made available for the Army during the past three months, the Infantry Reserves at home have sunk
so low that, assuming that the &quot; Other Arms &quot; are maintained, a deficiency in the Infantry must be anticipated on the 1st April amounting to approximately 150,000  200,000, and this at the time when active operations are likely to commence and all Battalions should be up to Establishment.4. I am to say that the Army Council view the situation with the gravest concern, and unless the number of men to be made available for the Army during the next four months can be considerably increased the whole plan of operations for 1918 may have to be modified.5. As regards the number of men held on the strength of the Army at home, the most careful scrutiny is in progress, together with an independent investigation by Mr. Samuel&apos;s House of Commons Committee in order to ascertain what numbers, if any, can be relegated to civil life for purposes of substitution. As you are well aware no appreciable numbers for Infantry can be expected by the transfer of physically fit men from Services and Departments owing to the pledges to Trades Unions and in the House of Commons which have been given in the past.6. In regard to the general situation, the Army Council will in due course lay the facts before the War Cabinet, but in the meantime I am to urge that in view of the extreme seriousness of the position, and of the danger to our troops in the Field should reinforcements fail, you will further examine the sources of man-power with a view to increasing the present estimate of men available during the next few months. To bring the Infantry in the Field up to Establishment, and to have reinforcements available to replace one month&apos;s estimated wastage on the 1st April next, 250,000&apos; men of Category &quot;A&quot; over the age of 18 years and 8 months, are required to be posted to Infantry during the month of November. In order to maintain the Infantry up to establishment after the 1st April, a monthly intake of 50,000 recruits of Category &quot;A.&quot; during the months of December 1917-June 1918 inclusive is required.7. I am further to request you to keep the Army Council informed from time to time of any modifications in the number of recruits anticipated by you as becoming available for the Army.I am, &amp;c.R. W. BRADE.APPENDIX II.Field-Marshal Sir D. Haig to the Secretary, War Office.Sir, General Headquarters, 1st Echelon, November 2, 1917.I have the honour to submit for the information of the Army Council the following brief review of the situation as regards British reinforcements for the fighting units of the Armies under my command.2. As regards British Infantry (a.) The actual monthly receipts from all sources from the 1st January of thisyear to the 30th September have averaged 67,900. (&amp;.) The monthly wastage from all sources during the same period has averaged75,700.(c.) In spite of the most strenuous efforts in combing out, substitution, transfer from other arms, and returned casualties, the actual deficiency below Establishment on the 30th September amounted to 69,700.(d.) It will be necessary in the near future to withdraw some 26,000 men from the Infantry to provide for the expansion of the Royal Flying Corps and Tank Corps, and for the return of men to Royal Engineer and Director-General of Transportation units.(e.) To make good the above deficiencies, to meet the estimated wastage, and to bring units up to Establishment by the 31st March, 1918, it is calculated that Trained drafts from England, including formed units to replace amalgamated Battalions, amounting to 355,100, will be required between the 1st October, 1917, and the 31st March, 1918.
3. As regards Artillery (a.) The monthly receipts from all sources, excluding formed units, for the same period have averaged: Royal Horse Artillery and Royal Field Artillery... 7,800 Royal Garrison Artillery    .........      ....      4,150(&amp;.) The monthly wastage from all sources during the same period has averaged: Royal Horse Artillery and Royal Field Artillery 7,600Royal Garrison Artillery    ...      ...      ......      4,250(c.) The actual deficiency below Establishment on the 30th September in the Royal Garrison Artillery was 700.(d.) To meet the estimated wastage it is calculated that, provided the substi-tution of Indian for British personnel proceeds satisfactorily, drafts from England, excluded formed units, amounting to 45,300 will be re-quired between the 1st October, 1917, and the 31st March, 1918.4. The addition of certain units and the expansion of others, e.g., Artillery, Survey Companies, Tramway Companies, Searchlight Sections, Pigeon Service, &amp;c, amounting in all to some 36,000 men is clearly foreshadowed and will be required. This estimate is exclusive of the figures mentioned in 2 (d), and will increase some-what the monthly requirements of the Artillery and other Services mentioned in paragraph 5.. 5. The total estimated requirements from England for 52 British Divisions between the 1st October, 1917, and the 31st March, 1918, will therefore be: (a:) British Infantry ............ 355,100(b.) British Artillery ............       45,300(c.) For new Units ......      ......       36,000(d.) Other Services ......      ...      ....       As heretofore.6. With regard to 5 (a.), I desire to draw attention to the necessity of these men being fully trained before they are sent to France and to point out that this means that some 285,000 Infantry drafts for France alone should be under training in England by the end of November.7. It may be assumed that during active operations next year the wastage will not, in any case, be less than during the past few months, and on this assumption, in order to maintain the efficiency of the 52 British Infantry Divisions now in France it will be necessary to ensure an average monthly income from England on and after the 1st April. 1918, of not less than: British Infantry...............       60,000Artillery...............      ... 8,600Other Services    ......      .........       As heretofore.8. Tables are attached showing details of the figures quoted, both for Royal Artillery and Infantry.9. As the resources of man power which will be at my disposal have a direct bear-ing on my plans for the ensuing winter and for next year, I request that this matter may receive immediate attention and that I may be informed at an early date what reinforcements I can count on receiving.I have, &amp;c,D.
