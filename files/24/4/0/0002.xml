[This Document is the Property of Els Britannic Majesty-s Governme^,] gPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August, 1917.SECRET. G. 152.BRITISH MISSION TO RUSSIA, JUNE AND JULY, 1917.Report by the Rt. Hon. Arthur Henderson, M.P. I. Introductory.1. On the 23rcl May the War Cabinet decided that a special Mission should visit Petrograd, and I accordingly left London the following day. My stay in Russia was of six weeks&apos; duration, and with the exception of a three days&apos; visit to Moscow, I spent the whole time in the Capital. I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs almost daily, and had interviews with nearly all the Ministers, and. with a number of persons of standing, both Russian and English, of the official, professional and employing classes. I also saw some representatives of the workers and had an interesting interview with two officials of the Peasants&apos; Organisation. I made arrangements to have the principal newspapers summarised and translated for my use, for which work Mr. Harold Williams, whose knowledge of Russia is recognised as being exceptionally extensive and intimate, placed himself at my disposal, and usually spent part of the day giving me information as to the latest events and movements of public opinion. Owing to the fact that the constituent assembly had not yet been elected and that the political parties had to some extent been in a process of remaking since the revolution, it was not easy to find opinions for which it could be claimed there existed any large organised body of support. This was especially the case with regard to the working classes, for whose support, numerous parties, sections and groups were competing, having regard to the coming election. Generally speaking, the working classes may be divided into Socialists of the more moderate type, usually described in Russia as Menshevikis and Maximalists (extremists), generally known as Bolshevikis. As regard the moderates, I had opportunities of ascertaining their views, but my knowledge of the views and tendencies of the Maximalists is mainly a matter of deduction from their published utterances and articles in their own Press. At Moscow I had an interesting time, where I saw representatives of all classes from the Bourse Committee to the Council of Workmen.2. Immediately on my arrival in Petrograd, I endeavoured to satisfy myself as to how far it was necessary to make the change which the Foreign Office contemplated and which lead to the appointment of my mission by the War Cabinet. My conclusions have already been reported to the Prime Minister, and I therefore consider it unnecessary to make further reference to this subject in my report.3. It is impossible to belong in Russia without realising the significance of one fact, to which I doubt whether full weight has ever been attached at home. Russia is a country of resources so vast that a comparatively slight effort is sufficient to support the national existence at a level which appears to be quite satisfactory to the nation. She is, for instance, self supporting in the matter of food, though it has been calculated that the area of cultivation is only one third, and that the production of that area not more than one half of what it might be. Again the population is so large that in spite of all failures of transport and organisation, enough men have always reached the front to hold the line, and there are battalions, it is said, with 15,000 men remaining in depot. The existence of resources in excess of the capacity or even the desire to use them, makes efficient organisation very difficult, while at the same time it weakens the incentive to organisation. In spite of waste, in spite of delay, in spite of corruption, there appears to be always enough to go on with. In turn, the food crisis, the fuel crisis, the financial crisis, comes and passes and Russia survives. It is hardly to be wondered at that . Russians have learned to gamble on the eternal Russian miracle. It always happens, and it is so easy to believe that it will happen next time too. Even foreigners seem insensibly to acquire the habit of believing that all will go well in spite of demonstrations to the contrary^ and to distrust the axioms and experience of the West. Notwithstanding the disquieting features with which I was confronted during my visit, I am strongly of the opinion that, given sufficient time, all will go well, and in the end Russia will [849] .B.
recover. But the vital question for us is whether Russia is likely to prove at any time within the next few months a really effective ally. It appeared to me that the factors on which the answer to this question depend were the military, capacity and the material efficiency of the country, its political stability, and the intentions of the ruling powers. To the best of my ability, therefore, I have endeavoured in this j report, leaving more remote speculations on one side, to form a reasoned estimate of each.II. Military Capacity.4. It seems to me that as regards the Army itself the prospects are literally incalculable. The supply of munitions is reported to be good, and for the time being there is no difficulty as to the supply of food. But of discipline, morale and fighting capacity; of the power of the Army to continue the present offensive, or to repeat it at a later date, I must confess that I have not been able to form any real estimate. All through June one heard the most conflicting stories. One day a mutinous regiment was brought back to its senses in a few hours by the use of force and the ring leaders with difficulty saved from the fury of their followers. Another day a battery which had been firing on the enemy was silenced by threats from two neighbouring divisions. A battalion degraded by Kerensky begged with tears to be returned to the front. In a few days they sent a message that they had reconsidered their position and they were satisfied that in a purely defensive war it was not consistent with their principles to undertake any aggressive movement. According to reports, the fleet was no better; the Black Sea squadron was loyal, mutinous, loyal again in the space of three days (when the &quot;Breslau&quot; came out it was found to be merely inefficient), and the alternate revolts and submissions of Kronstadt, which in the first week of my visit were the chief topic of conversation in Petrograd, in the end became too tedious to follow. At this moment I am not sure whether Kronstadt, recognises the Russian Government or not.5. As the month wore on the news from the front became better. The inexhaustible energy of Kerensky seemed to be prevailing, but there was always the doubt whether his influence reached further than the audience he was addressing at any particular moment or would last longer than the arrival of the next party of student agitators. A vigorous propaganda was maintained by the Government and its friends. The War Committee of the Duma and the Anglo-Russian Commission co-operated to supply troops with patriotic literature, and every army commander was furnished with a political adviser to help him in managing his troops. The victory of the 1st July proved that the indications were not wholly fallacious, and the relief manifested in Government circles was the best proof of the uncertainty and strain through which Ministers had passed. But whether the initial success can be pursued or even maintained is a question to which the answer must be sought not only in the temper of the troops but in the.material conditions behind the lines.*III. Material Efficiency.6. The one natural resource which is not super-abundant in Russia is industrial productivity. Industry, though very highly developed, in certain directions, is still on a comparatively smal] scale : the capacity of the workmen in comparison to those of our own country is low; and during the war the closure of the Baltic route to England has imposed on the railways which supply Petrograd and the North-West with coal an almost unbearable strain. The industries of the Capital are now dependent on coal borne 1,200 miles from the Donetz basin by a railroad which crosses the lines of supply of the Army. In a country of the size of Russia, transport is all in all. The carrying capacity of the railways had been gradually declining for some time, and the revolution was followed by a wide-spread industrial disturbance which seemed to portend a complete collapse of the mining and metal industries on which ultimately transport rests.7. In my judgment, this is the vital point, even in the military situation. It is clear that with the increasing shortage of tonnage, and with the Milner pro-gramme reduced to nearly half the original estimate, Russia must do more for herself and expect less from the Allies. What prospect is there that she will succeed?* Since this paragraph was written, the Russian Armies have been heavily defeated. The story and its sequel are known to my colleagues, but I thought it best to allow the paragraph to stand as a record of my impressions at the time of leaving Russia.
8. There are in Russia three principal industrial areas Petrograd, Moscow ;and the Donetz. Every one of them has been visited with the same kind of labour trouble, demands by the workpeople, exorbitant at once in extent and character, presented in an atmosphere heated by every kind of political agitation. ... These demands are of two kinds. On the one hand, there are demands of a purely economic kind, for higher wages and shorter hours. On the other hand, there are demands for what is called control of industry by the workers. The situation cannot be clearly described in terms of English industry, because on neither side is there any organisation comparable to our employers&apos; federations or trade unions, and the habit of collective negotiation has still to be formed. But, broadly speaking, the movement for better conditions&apos; is the counterpart of our trade unionism: the movement for control of industry has its analogue in the shop stewards&apos; agitation.9. There can. I think, be little doubt that, until the revolution, capital had not been required to carry anything like its fair share of the burden of the war. All my information leads me to conclude that the profits of Russian industry during the first two years of the war were enormous. Taxation was not heavy and opportunities for evasion were many. On the other hand, the cost of living rose steadily : rents were, it is true, fixed at pre-war rates by Government, but landlords recouped themselves by,withholding the fuel which by Russian custom is included in the fittings of a house. Every other commodity increased in price, until to-day the cost of necessaries stands at 100 per cent, to 200 per cent, above the pre-war standard. Against this must be set the prohibition of vodka, which has added millions to the income of the working classes, and the universal shortage of labour, which at least ensures a sufficiency of work for all. It is difficult to estimate the result of ail these factors, but on- the whole I should say that there is to-day little comfort and little destitution. The peasantry are well off, and the streets of Petrograd and Moscow bear witness to a very fair level of prosperity among the industrial population : there are not many beggars, and a man or woman in rags is rarely to be found. Outside every boot shop may be seen a queue of purchasers, waiting sometimes for hours, but I do not think I once saw a barefooted child. The great demonstration of the 1st July was largely composed of munition workers from the industrial quarters. The vast majority of men and women were decently and even smartly dressed.10. The conclusion I drew from the information supplied to me was, that while there was good ground for a reasonable increase in wages, the demands of the workpeople, in many instances, were quite without economic justification, and amounted to a reckless spoliation of industry.11. The following figures throw the position into relief : In the metal works of the Donetz basin wages at the revolution were increased, on an average, by 52*5 per cent. Fresh demands were presented within two months for further increases amounting to 278 per cent, of the&apos; pre-revolution total. At the same time, production declined by about 25 per cent. Taking these factors together, and allowing for the consequential rise in the price of raw materials and for the recent doubling of railway freights, the owners calculated that the original demands had raised the cost of production by Rs. 281,550,000, and that the subsequent demands, if granted, would raise it by Rs. 750,160,000. The share capital is Rs. 192,000,000 and the two demands amounted respectively to 4 and 10 times the gross profit and 16 and 42 times the dividends paid in 1915-16. In a neighbouring area the monthly wages bill has risen from Rs. 400,000 to Rs. 950,000, a sum in excess of the total monthly earnings of the business. The Petrograd cotton mills are paying in wages just 6 times what they paid before the war.The decline in production is shown by the following figures  	December.	February.

At the Poutiloff Works (the chief munition factory in Petrograd, and a State-controlled establishment) it is calculated that 60 per cent, of pre-revolutionary output is a good day&apos;s work.   Piece work has been almost universally abolished.12. The demand for control of industry is much more mischievous and much more difficult to analyse. The clearest statement on it which I was able to get came from Moscow. The Factory Committee of two of the principal works there issued, a day or two before my departure, a notice saying that in future they would be responsible for the purchase of material; the sale and distribution of products, and the general administration of the business, including correspondence with other firms. But, as a rule, the agitation takes a less definite shape, and discloses itself in sudden and unsystematic acts of interference with the business of the factory. Thus at one works the management had sold some chemicals for which they had no use, but the men refused to allow them to be sent away. An English cotton mill in Petrograd, being faced with a stoppage through non-delivery of material, borrowed 9,000 bales from a neighbouring mill: the workpeople would not let them be moved. At first one was inclined to see a definitely Syndicalist movement at work, and in any case the cry is heard with a persistency which seems to indicate a deeper origin than the machinations of agitators and to reflect some fixed tendency of the Russian mind. But in the end, I came to the conclusion that though there might be some purpose among the leaders, there was little theory or reflection of any kind behind the clamour of their followers. Ancient grudges against the employing class and its agents and a light-hearted determination to assert the new-won freedom of the masses by interfering in everything, seemed to me to account for niost of the symptoms. The passion for meetings and Committees just now in Russia is insatiable, and to order the removal of technical experts or to regulate the distribution of products without the slightest knowledge of markets appeared to the new-fledged Factory Committees as much within their competence as the regulation of wages, the settlement of disciplinary questions, and the engagement and dismissal of workpeople.13. The two movements operating together have brought Russian industry into a position of grave danger. The effect of granting the economic demands is at once to reduce- output and send up the cost of the product. The Russian workman has few ambitions : if his pay is doubled his standard of comfort remains unchanged, and he works half as many days as before. The demand for control is not only making the life of the employer a burden but hampering in every direction the working of the .factories. It is frightening the banks which finance the undertakings, and not the least of the dangers confronting Russian industry is that liquid capital, never very abundant, will fail altogether.14. The task before &quot;the Government, therefore, if the Army and the nation are to be kept supplied, is not merely to increase the productivity of industry but in the first instance to restore it to normal stability. During the six weeks I was in Russia very little was done. On the day I arrived in Petrograd, Konovaloff resigned the Ministry of Commerce as a demonstration against the extravagances of his colleague Skobeleff, the new Socialist Minister of Labour. The position was not filled when I left, and so far as I could make out commerce received so much attention as Shinga-reff, Tereschenko and Skobeleff together could spare from their own departments. On the same day I was invited to address the Council of Ministers on State control of industry in England, and an article which I wrote on the same subject at the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs was published in the official organ of the Ministry of Commerce. From time to time I asked what progress was being made, towards a settlement of the industrial problem, but I could never get a convincing reply, and in the end I came to the conclusion that Ministers were really afraid to move, although the Minister of Labour did issue an appeal deprecating disorder and urging the importance of. organisation.*15. An experience I had with Ministers personally seemed to show that the explanation was correct. The English employers of Petrograd approached the Government through me with a proposal that in return for the limitation of their profits the Government should undertake to regulate their relations with labour and guarantee protection against violence to person or property. At the interview which followed the Minister of Finance, who presided, explained at some length why the* One of the things impressed on my mind as.a result of my mission is the importance of attaching to the various Embassies and Legations a representative with knowledge of Labour problems at home, and also of keeping both Embassies and consulates fully supplied with the latest publications bearing on Labour questions.   I gathered that both the Ambassador and the consul at Moscow favoured the idea. &quot;
proposal was impracticable: the Government had not at its disposal the personnel for a comprehensive control of. industry; the organisation which in England regulated the relations of capital and laoour was in Russia on both sides lacking, and he pressed the employers to help the Government by federating for mutual support. When asked whether it was not possible to supply the want of established constitution and defining their functions and powers, he replied that the Govern-ment must wait until the &quot; revolutionary psychology of the workpeople &quot; had given way to a more reasonable condition of mind; at the moment any attempt to bring order into labour would involve greater dangers to industry than continuance of laisser-faire. Privately, Tereschenko, who was present, admitted that the Govern-ment were considering some such plan, and the Minister of Labour had already told me that he was including a similar provision in the terms of settlement of a Moscow strike.16. I thought it right to give the Russian Government an opportunity. of learning something of the apprehensions which existed in the circle of the Allies, and I decided to call a conference of Ambassadors at which the industrial situation could be frankly discussed and, if possible, some collective action undertaken. It was agreed that the failure of the Milner Programme gave us occasion to approach the Russian Government without offence, and Senator Root and I were deputed to lay before them the views of the Conference. The aide-memoire which we left with M. Tereschenko is printed as an appendix to this report (Appendix &quot;A &quot;). The Minister for Foreign Affairs received our suggestions very cordially and promised his assistance in securing the co-operation of the Government. In future if the the arrangements we discussed are put into effect there will be a Joint Committee of Allied and Russian Officers meeting regularly to consider all questions of supply, the Russians will report to their Government and the Allies to their Ambassadors, who will meet from time to time under the presidency of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to deal with larger matters of policy.* In this way it is to be hoped the experience of the Allied representatives will be brought to bear direct upon the Government instead of being lost among Government departments. It is little to do for an Ally labouring under such difficulties, but the Russian character makes it almost impossible to do more. If there is any national feeling in Russia (a question on which Russians differ) its most striking manifestation is extreme sensitiveness to foreign interference. If there is not, national jealousy must be regarded as its substitute.It is now for the Government to act.17. The chief hope for Russian industry is that the Government will take the labour question firmly in hand. They have already cleared the ground by imposing, a 90 per cent, excess profits tax. In the Donetz basin a commission is at work examining the cost of production with a view to fixing selling prices, and when I left Russia it was generally believed that the Government intended to purchase the whole output of coal and sell it at fixed rates. As it is impossible to determine cost price or selling price without taking wages into account, there are grounds for hoping that the Government will in its own interest be forced either to undertake the regulation of wages direct, or better still to establish some machinery for the adjustment of all industrial differences. At present the root of the trouble is undoubtedly the &quot; revolutionary psychology &quot; of which Shingareff spoke. . The demands of the workmen.bear no economic relation either to their, own standards of living or to the capacities of the industry. They are as much as anything a mode of political agitation;, deputations are led bv rival political candidates, applications are framed and pleaded by professional lawyers, and, as an employer said to. me, the workmen only supply the &quot; Cheers and Laughter&apos;! in the shorthand report. Against the revolutionary psychology of the workmen one must set the counter-revolutionary psychology of many employers. Men habituated to the old regime under which the industrial proprietor seems rarely to have had  direct or  human relations with his employees, do not find it easy to^ * In this connection I should like to urge the appointment, either of a special commission of experienced business men or special commercial investigators to be attached temporarily to the Embassy to make searching enquiry as to the possibility of trade development between Russia and this country after the war. There are large districts vhere we have no representative to look after..our commercial interesis. The activity of German consuls and other ag-ents before the war is well known, and not a few believe that the Root Mission was sent not without reference to trade considerations.[849]C
breathe the new atmosphere or to realize that in some shape or other the workman&apos;s demand for at least a share in the control of the conditions under which he works must be gratified. Speaking of one of his foremen, an employer said: &quot; He is worth any two of the others; he had a bullet through him in 1905 and he has been a different man ever since.&quot; They are learning by experience; the wiser heads see that the remedy sometimes advocated of general closure of works to give the Socialists a lesson would lead straight to disaster, and that the only safeguard against the control and dissipation of capital by labour is control both of capital and labour by the State.18. It is easier to find a formula than to find means for making it effective. On the one side we have the incalculable temper of the Russian masses; it has more than once been found that in Russia revolution is the offspring of defeat and even a transient victory on the Eastern front may bring order back. The Government have been holding on, I believe, in the hope that a successful offensive will render the situation more manageable; &quot; psychologisky momyeut &quot; runs like a refrain through the assurances of official optimists. Very likely they are right But on the other side we have the fact that good intentions will not repair a locomotive or get the coal to drive it, and the transport situation may at any moment become desperate. My. real fear is not so much that an industrial debacle will take place as that industry will be found to have fallen so far behind during the upheaval of the revolution that it will not be able to do more than hold itself in being during the critical months to come. In other words the autumn and winter which should be periods of recuperation will, I fear, be spent in a struggle against famine and frost from which Russia may emerge without any permanent injury, but also without strength to continue the war as an effective ally.IV. The Political Outlook.19. There are two factors which must be clearly apprehended by anyone who wishes to understand Russia to-day. One is the Dualism of Government and Sovyet; the other is the disintegration of the Russian State fabric caused by a revolution following on a long period of inept administration. The two react on each other; if there were in existence a single centre of [lower and authority its influence would in the end be bound to assert itself in the routine of national life. If on the other hand there were a tradition of diligent and honest administration the Central Authority would have at once a solid basis and an effective machine through which to work.20. As it is, we have a Government consisting broadly of Socialists who derive their mandate from the Sovyets and Liberals who derive theirs from the late Duma. On the whole the Liberals (under which term I include non-party men like Prince Lvoff and Tereschenko as well as the Cadet Ministers) have the greater share of capacity, or at any rate experience, but they have no clear constituency to stand upon.    The Socialists are untrained men, but they have the Sovyets at their backs.21. Until the crisis of May, the dualism was open and avowed. The revolu-tion was headed by the Duma, and for days the Duma was in every man&apos;s mouth. It appointed a Provisional Government and then slipped off the scene. It is still in being though not sitting, and may remain in being till the Constituent Assembly meets. But its authority has passed to the Councils of Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Deputies. Had the Cadets been able to grip the revolution from the outset, give it a practical direction and rally the people to them, there can be little doubt that Russia would be far stronger and her friends more hopeful to-day. But they drifted while the people were moving, and the real revolutionaries were acting; by a disastrous accident Moscow was cut off from news of Petrograd for three days, and when the storm subsided it was apparent that whatever the Government might be, the rulers of Russia were to be found in the Sovyets which were springing up throughout the country under the guidance of men who had learnt the business of revolution in 1905. The obscuration of Rodzianko, who for a few hours was the man of the revolution marks the decline of the Constitutionalists, and the fall of Miluikoff and Guchkoff the beginning of the new order.22. It is not easy to explain the resulting situation: The Government as a whole and the Liberal Ministers in particular are in practice responsible to no one; the Socialists are responsible to the Sovyet. Day by day and night after night Skobeleff, Chernoff, Pieshekhanoff, Kerenski, Tseretelli had to justify themselves to a body
which had no legal standing, was not representative of the nation, but which enjoyed unlimited moral authority over the, populace of the capital. - In June the All-Russia Congress of Sovyets began its sittings and the Socialist Ministers appeared before it to give an account of themselves and their policy, and to ask for help in carrying on the business of the State. When Kronstadt revolted the Government sent orders and the Sovyet sent delegates. Representatives or the Sovyet visit the armies to persuade the troops to obedience; they enforce with appeals and arguments the representations of the Government to Finland and the Ukraine. So far they have never used force, and the Government dare not, but in Petrograd their word is law&quot;. Sometimes a narrative of events throws more light on a situation than much commentary, and the following record of doings in the Capital from the I8th June to the 24th June may help my colleagues to realise a situation which is not easily to be translated into English terms.*23. The All-Russia Congress opened on Saturday the 16th with a debate on the expulsion of the Swiss pacifist Grimm. This first trial of strength showed a majority for the party of order of 640 to 120, and on the whole subsequent discussions proved that these figures fairly represented the relative strength of the two sides. The second question to be taken up was the attitude of the Congress to the Coalition Government; the debate-was distinguished by a speech of exceptional violence from Lenin, who appeared to be recommending the immediate arrest of all capitalists and the extraction of their trade secrets as a cure for all the ills of society. He was vigorously opposed by Tseretelli and Skobeleff.24. At this point the attention of the Congress was diverted from politics to a matter of municipal order. A group of Anarchists with revolvers and machine-guns established themselves in the offices of the Russkaya Volya, where they occupied their time in printing appeals. An indignant crowd assembled; militia were despatched; but it was only on the arrival of the Commandant of the Petrograd Military District with a party of Cossacks that the garrison consented to discuss terms. Negotiations were carried on between the leader of the Anarchists (a member of the Sovyet) and three emissaries of the Congress selected for their extremist principles. There is some doubt as to the terms of the capitulation, but in the end the whole party was escorted in safety to the Congress, which at once ordered their release. They thereupon in triumph returned to the Durnovo Dacha, a fine house, with grounds, in the most turbulent of the industrial suburbs, which had been commandeered by a coalition of Anarchists and Leninites for their political headquarters.25. The following days were spent by the Congress in receiving reports from the Socialist Ministers, Kerenski, Chernoff, and PieshekhaiiofT. Even Chernoff, who .is the most extreme among the Ministers, spoke reasonably, and reminded his audience that complete socialism could not be achieved in a day. PieshekhanofPs sober statement of the food position impressed even the Leninites. On Thursday the vote was taken, and a resolution to support the Provisional Government, so long as it adhered to the programme of the revolution, was passed by a majority of about 600 to 120, 50 or 60 abstaining.26. Thursday again was occupied with a domestic problem. The Minister of Justice had called upon the Anarchists to evacuate the house of Durnoff, and they appealed to the Congress. The Minister explained that he had no intention of interfering with the legitimate political activities of any party, and that his attempt to expel the occupants (which, indeed, as he had had to employ militia, who at once fraternised with the garrison, had been a complete failure) was the result of a misunderstanding of their objects. In the meantime, there had been disturbances, not very serious, in the neighbourhood, and the workpeople, to whom the grounds had been thrown open, went on strike as a protest against the expulsion of their benefactors. The Congress decided that the grounds should remain open, but that the Anarchists must leave, and they addressed a strong appeal to the workpeople, pointing out the mischief of sectional and sporadic strikes.27. The Congress again returned to affairs of state on a motion to dissolve the Duma on the ground that the members were displaying reactionary tendencies. This resolution, which was carried, was largely the consequence of a meeting of members* It must always be borne in mind that political discussion in Russia is conducted in a western terminology which has only a token value to the ordinary Russian. There is a little pamphlet, which appears to have a large circulation, called the &quot; Revolutionary Pocket Dictionary.&quot; Out of over a hundred words which are explained only six are Russian.
fsummoned on Saturday before by Miliukoff and Rodzianko, at which resolutions on foreign policy of a decidedly anti-internationalist cast were passed.28. On Friday the Congress sat to consider the report on the war brought up by the.Executive. For the third time, proceedings were interrupted by the necessity of dealing with domestic disorder, this time on a scale.which for the moment threatened to be very serious. As a protest against the action of the Government in the matter of the Anarchists and their house, the extremists gave notice of an armed demonstration to take place on Saturday. In the Congress, the President Tcheidze made a grave appeal for decisive measures. Kerenski came down and stated, amid loud applause, that the Government would take all necessary steps. In the end, it was decided to forbid all demonstrations on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, and on Saturday morning three declarations appeared which struck me at the time as marking a decisive point in the development of events. One was by the Government, announcing that all attempts at violence would meet with the sternest measures on the part of the authorities. A second was by the workmen of the principal engineering works refusing to countenance the demonstrations. The third, which condemned the demonstration in the strongest terms, was signed by the Congress, the Petrograd Sovyet, and a number of other Socialist and revolutionary organisations.29. Sunday passed off quietly, and the Congress continued its discussion of the report on the war.30. To complete the story, I might add that two hours after the news of the offensive reached the Government, the house of Durnoff was surrounded by troops and the garrison seized. The Anarchists were removed to the prison under the Winter Palace, and Senator Root, who was lodged above, could not conceal the pleasure with which he had listened to the noise outside his windows of &quot; a sixteenth-century Cossack sharpening his sixteenth-century sword.&quot; When I left Petrograd, however, a fresh party were in possession.31. There are three points in this story which appear to me to be significant. One is the complete interdependence of Government and Sovyet: the Sovyet supplies the political, the Government the executive force for any action of State. The second is the loyalty shown by the Sovyet in maintaining the cause of order and the docility of the populace. The third is the extreme difficulty of using force, even when Government and Sovyet are united and public opinion is behind both.32. The rallying of the Sovyet to the Government has been the most obvious change that has come about in the last two months. Much is due to Kerenski, who before the Coalition of May threw the same energy into the work of winning the Sovyet as he has since displayed in restoring discipline in the Army. Since Kerenski became Minister for War his work has been continued by Tseretelli. Rut credit must also be given to the other Socialists, who have learnt much from responsibilitv and have laboured vigorously to keep the Sovyet on the right side. Public opinion has done something; experience of affairs and reaction against the monotonous extravagance of Lenin and his associates has done the rest. Men who remember the first days say that the Sovyet is further to the Right than the Government.33. There can be little doubt that the alliance has saved Petrograd from at least overt anarchy, and in my view the political stability of Russia mainly depends on its continuance. The union of anarchy and order is one of the most striking things in Russia to-d&amp;j. In Petrograd I never saw a street accident or a street fight: it is said the suburbs are safer at night than they were before the revolution, and our consul reported that the state of affairs as regards personal security in Kronstadt is comparably better since the revolt. In the country districts, where the peasants are occupying or not occupying other people&apos;s land, as their mood suggests, there is singularly little violence, and, except where urban agitators have penetrated, it does not seem very difficult for a landowner to come to amicable arrangements with his tenantry. There seems to be more clanger of a fight between those peasants who have remained in the Commune and those who have left it and become smallholders. The Congress is forming a National Executive to take the place of the Petrograd Sovyet, and if the new body, which in any case will be less influenced by the nerves and passions of the metropolitan populace, follows the course marked out by the old, there is a fair prospect that order will be maintained and bloodshed avoided. In a city where there are no police and 100,000 soldiers armed arid idle, it is something to have an authority which can command and be obeyed, even if that authority is not the Government. As time goes on and one crisis after another is surmounted or evaded, the habit of obedience will return. Already the success on the front is making the situation at home more manageable. Russia is a country of slow returns,.
and it is well that the head of the Government should be a man in whom patience is personified. At times one was tempted to be impatient at the assurance of the firm action that would be taken next time, at the strong hand always poised but never descending. But day by day in Petrograd one saw that, in spite of everything, the food did arrive, the trains did run, and the peace was not broken. Much must be put down to the lymphatic Russian temperament which, even in seasons of violent emotion, finds individual initiative difficult. They are not, I think, a difficult people to govern. But the machinery of Government is so frail to-day that the exercise of force, even if approved by the majority of the people, might destroy it altogether. So, on the whole, one came to realise that there was something in the doctrine of the psychological moment, and to hope that slowly, by self-control and patience, the Government would draw to its side all the forces of law and authority, and that violence, if at last it showed its head, would be encountered and beaten down by their union.34. I need hardly say that in circumstances such as I have described there is bound to be a large party which is not satisfied with the policy of patience and slow returns. There is, indeed, much in Russia to-day which must fill a patriotic Russian with indignation and shame : soldiers at the front debating whether they shall fight, soldiers in barracks debating whether they shall go to the front or allow the guns to go, seven independent city republics, villages on the Volga levying toll on passing steamers while the taxes are unpaid, the police disbanded and German agents at large throughout the country, workpeople stopping essential industries, and peasants concealing the food on which the life of the nation depends. These were not the hopes of the revolution. And with the disillusionment there is, I think, among the Cadets who have withdrawn some remorse over lost opportunities and bitterness at the success of those who have remained.35. Excluded from power, the Cadets of the Right are planning their restoration. Their watchword is &quot; firm government,&quot; but, so far, beyond irritating the populace and making the task of their old friends harder than it might have been, they seem to have achieved little. MiliukofPs great abilities are marred by pedantry and tactlessness; his appearances outside the Embassy at the head of a demonstrating crowd, with a counter-demonstrating fringe, only serve to give colour to the belief that the Embassy is &quot; the foyer of the counter-revolution.&apos;&quot; Guchkoff is a subtler spirit, but he was trusted neither by the Court nor by the Duma, nor is he trusted to-day by his own party.36. Professor Struve, the distinguished economist, who struck me as one of the most forcible and original personalities I encountered in Russia, gave me one day an analysis of the situation which is worth reproducing. According to him, there is no Socialism in Russia : only a mixture of anarchy and romanticism. The Left is composed of the ex-royalist mob, headed by honest men who combine with a few Socialist principles the passions of the middle classes without their virtues. Lvoff and Tereschenko are able men, but weak : Kerenski has both courage and capacity, but is paralysed by a sentimental attachment to revolutionary ideas which he is not quite strong enough to overcome. Miliukoff: and Guchkoff could have headed a strong Government, but the fatal step was taken on the opening day of the new order when Kerenski, with his own hand, struck out the reference to the war in the draft declaration of the Provisional Government. The Government have never recovered the authority they then lost, and the fall of Miliukoff, engineered by some of his own Cadet colleagues, especially Nekrasoff, finally deprived them of the indispensable elements of determination and force. Struve would like to see a pure Socialist Government in power for a fortnight; it would last no longer, and if it tried to make peace it would at once break up through the inevitable schism between those who wish for peace at all costs and those who watn a good peace for Russia. It would be followed by a Cadet-Octobrist administration, which the natural reaction from Socialist excesses would invest with the authority which the present Government lacks. If only authority were present, the existing administration would naturally be of that complexion, and the Socialists would either submit or disappear. Above all, the Allies must speak firmly : concessions as to the aims of the war are injurious to the Allies, and equally to Russia, where they only serve to strengthen the party which is against the war.37. The desire for firm government (known in Leninite circles as counter-revolution) is natural. But until the populace begin to feel the discomforts of prolonged, anarchy (and so far the revolution has not done much harm to anyone), they will, I think, take what the day brings, and when -discomfort comes they will very likely make demands upon the Government which it will be impossible for any [849] &apos; D
Government to meet. Therefore, among the more far-sighted classes, who are at once more sensitive to the disgrace of the present and more apprehensive of the material dangers of the future, there is a desire to see the crisis precipitated in hopes of the reaction that will follow. Some would like the Government to try its strength with the extremists in Petrograd; others, who realise that the strength might be found on the wrong side, would like to give the extremists their run. Cossacks in the Neyski or Socialists in the Marisky Palace are both advocated as remedies for a situation which even moderate men find almost intolerable. But the discussion whether the bleeding should come before the purging, or the purging before the bleeding, is checked by the reflection that the patient might not survive the first half of the operation.38. In my view, there is nothing, short of compromising a material interest of our own or our Allies, that we ought not to do to sustain the credit of the Provisional Government. It is not easy to help Russia because her chief trial to-day is anarchy, which no amount of foreign sympathy advice will mitigate or restrain&apos;. The suspicion of England is so deep that the most tactful offers of help may be distorted by extremists into demands for control, and used as counts in the agitation against the Government and the Allies. On the other hand, any appearance of coldness or neglect is at once seized upon by Bolsheviki to prove that Russia is being betrayed by her Allies, and by Nationalists to prove that the Allies have discovered that they are being betrayed by Russia. To defend itself from internal assailants, the Government has to assume an attitude of stiffness towards its Allies which does not, I think, correspond with its real intentions, and certainly not with the necessities of its position. The affair of the deposition of King Constantine will illustrate my meaning. The Left seized on the fact that France and England were interfering with the &quot; right of peoples to dispose of. themselves &quot;; the Right maliciously emphasised the fact that we had proceeded without taking Russia into our councils. As a result, the Government, who at heart were as glad to see the last of Constantine as anyone else, were obliged to dissociate themselves from our action and to issue remonstrances which, though addressed to Paris and London, were intended to take effect in Petrograd. So too, in our dealings with Russia with regard to finance or supplies, we must consider the imponderable effect on the credit of the Provisional Government, as well as the material loss or gain. We may look forward to seeing much, both of our money and our munitions, wasted, but I believe it is better that they should be wasted than withheld.39. To sum up, my conclusion is that the political stability of Russia depends, so far as it can be determined by purely political elements, on the continued existence of the Provisional Government. But, as everyone in Russia says, the question is not political but psychological, and the psychology of the people will as time goes on be determined more and more by the material situation. The heat of the revolution is subsiding, and the victories on the Austrian front are bound to create or revive some national feeling. On the other hand, there is always the possibility that forces which are beyond the power of the Government to control may at any moment provoke a fresh crisis. There is the food question : all my enquiries failed to produce any certain estimate of the position before and after the coming harvest, but it is generally admitted to be grave. The cotton industry, again, which furnishes employment for 500,000 people in Petrograd and Moscow, is in a very critical position; Russia has been compelled to rely during the war mainly on home-grown supplies, and the Turkesta crop is almost certain to fail. Above all, there is the fuel and transport problem. Many Russians, including some who are whole-heartedly for the war and the Allies, look forward to the winter with real terror. Whatever the political position may be, the material condition of affairs in October, November and December next is bound to be such as make even a strongly seated Government anxious, and in endeavouring to estimate the political stability of Russia we must not lose sight of the possibility of a material crisis which will provoke a fresh outburst of revolutionary passion.V.- The Intentions of the Ruling Powers.40. I have added as an appendix to this report (Appendix B) a survey of the existing political parties in Russia. But it seems to be unnecessary to refine too narrowly on the difference between centres, lefts and rights. On the great internal questions, land and local governments, though they all have their programme, they will not take their final stand till the elections to the Constituent are impending; and
in the Constituent there will be groupings of parties which not even a Russian would venture to forecast.41. On the question of the war, however, a closer analysis is necessary. I should he inclined to distinguish four main groups and their policies thus : (1) The Cadets of the Right are a Nationalist Party, strongly for the Allies and strongly for war to victory.(2) The Cadets of the Coalition, many Socialist Revolutionaries and some Social Democrats, are for such a prosecution of the war . as will recover for Russia her right to be heard in the Councils of the Allies, and to insist there on the revolutionary peace programme being discharged in such a way as the situation at the war may render practicable and desirable. This party which might be called the Coalition group shades off into(3) The &quot; Mensheviki&quot; of all Socialist parties who support the Coalition and approve of the offensive, but would use the constitutional pressure of the Allied Labour and Socialist parties on the Government of the Entente to persuade them to abate their war claims which they regard as the chief obstacle to a general peace.(4) The &quot; Bolsheviki &quot; of all Socialist parties, who are against the Government, the offensive and everything else which would frustrate the universal proletarian uprising against Capitalism and the war. The leaders, or at least the most representative men of the four groups, are Miliukoff, Tereschenko, Tseretelli and Lenin.42. A revulsion of feeling such as would bring the first group into power is not, I think, conceivable. The country is too tired of the war to think of real victory. Nor, at the other extreme, does a Bolshevik rising appear to be likely; if it succeeded the result would be positive anarchy, and Russia would cease to count whether for peace or war. So far as I can estimate the position, the attitude of Russia will at any moment be determined by the balance of the second and third groups the difference being that the second is more opportunist and nationalist, the third is more inter-nationalist and doctrinaire. Under a defeat or the pressure of material hardships there would be a move to the left: victory and internal consolidation will make the tide set to the right.43. It will make the position as it appears to me clearer if I set out what I believe to be the attitude of the several groups to the &quot;No annexations or indemnities&quot; formula. By Miliukoff of course it would be rejected outright; by the Bolsheviki it is read with extravagant glosses as to Ireland and Egypt. By the Coalition group and the Mensheviki it is taken more or less in its proper meaning, but with a milder and a severer interpretation.44. I might put it another way. If we proclaimed our adhesion to the formula without reserve the Nationalists would assail us as fainthearts, and the Bolsheviki would call it another English lie. The Mensheviki would take us to their hearts and the Government would be as much disturbed by our precipitancy as they are to-day embarrassed by our reservations. Kerenski put the position of the Government very neatly in a conversation with our Consul at Moscow : &quot; Don&apos;t you Allies be alwaj^s dotting the i&apos;s and crossing the t&apos;s of that formula : in another two months I shall be curbing the appetites of my own people.&quot;45. On the other side, as illustrating what I believe to be the Menshevik position, I might refer.to a conversation I had and a speech I heard in Moscow which impressed me as much as any of my experiences in Russia.The speech was by Rudnieff, President of the Workmen&apos;s Council, a Social Revolutionary whose party incidentally has just won a great victory in the Moscow Municipal Elections. After I had spoken on the attitude of British Labour to the war, he explained, quite courteously and without heat, that there was evidently no question of our converting one another; we had exchanged views and must continue to differ. He did not charge British Labour with holding Imperialist views, but they were supporting an Imperialist Government: that was enough to show the difference hetwoRTi us.The conversation was with Urnoff, President of the Soldiers&apos; Council. He spoke with deep feeling on the efforts he and his friends were making to create a general enthusiasm for the war in the army and among the people. There was, he said, a strong sense of loyalty among the masses which made the idea of a separate peace distasteful to them. But the one thing that was needed to convert passive loyalty into active support was an unreserved renunciation by the Allies of  all
Imperialist aims. It was in vain that I pointed out that my Government had undertaken to review its existing agreements with Russia.   He was not satisfied.46. Towards the end of my stay I had an interview with Tseretelli, who may be regarded as the chief exponent of the Menshevik idea. When I pressed the idea of an Allied Socialist Conference in London, he showed little interest in the proposal. I asked whether Russian delegates would be present: he thought they might come, provided that they were bound to nothing. His real interest was to have the Stockholm Conference before the meeting of the Allied Governments, in order to take some of the edge off the differences which separate the belligerents. This is in line with the whole policy of his group, which is to bring pressure from within to bear upon all Governments the direction of a general renunciation of Imperialist aims.47. Having regard, on the one side, to the stiffness with which the formula is maintained in public, and on the other to the plasticity of the Russian mind always ready to take shape from events&apos; &apos;I soon came to the conclusion that our wisest course would be to reserve anything we have to say until we can say it freely in council with the Allies when the results of the offensive are known. At present the slightest reserve nullifies the effect of the most generous assurances and makes the position of the Government more difficult than silence. On the other hand, Russia has not yet had time or occasion to think out the meaning of her own professions. For both these reasons, I am glad that the proposal for an Allied Conference in September has been accepted. We can then open our minds to one another, and by then, also, Russia will perhaps know what she really wants. . . At present one has to work through a layer of German propaganda and a myer of home-born rhetoric before one can divine the genuine intention of what is, after all, the ruling power in Russia, the Russian people. My belief is that their deepest desire is to escape from the war, along with their Allies, and to preserve the revolution. They are not afraid of being defeated, because Russia simply cannot, in any sense in which Englishmen or Frenchmen understand the word, be defeated. No really Russian province is occupied by the enemy : it is a remarkable fact that in Petrogad the refugees have much the same standing as our friendly aliens in the East End. They have no longer a national idol to fight for, and they have not yet replaced it by a national ideal. They are afraid of the winter and they are tired. At the same time, they are not to-day disposed to a separate peace, some because it would be disgraceful, others because it would be dangerous. And as they cannot have a separate peace, they are coming to see that they must go on fighting while they can. But no one can say what the winter will bring : the danger may then be on the other side, and honour may yield to famine. In these circumstances, it appears to me that what the Western Allies have to do first of all is to clear their minds as to their own aims, and then decide whether the difference between what Russia will do in any case and the most that Russia might do, is worth purchasing, and if so, at what price.VI. -Conclusion.48. I have endeavoured in the earlier part of this report to put together some of the considerations which, in my judgment, must determine our estimate of what Russia might do. I have indicated the factors which appear to me to be certain, uncertain and incalculable. There are others which are outside my knowledge-^I know nothing of the resources of Austria, nor can I gauge the repercussion of the recent victories either on Austria or on Germany. But on the facts within my knowledge, my judgment is that while, in the interests of future friendship with Russia, our own good name, and the peace of the world, we are bound to stand by her faithfully and generously till the end, we should be wiser, if the war is to last beyond the coming autumn, not to reckon on her being able to give us sustained and effective support.(Signed) ARTHUR HENDERSON.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., mh July, 1917.
APPENDIX A.A conference of Allied representatives sat under the presidency of Mr. Henderson at the British Embassy on the 22nd June to the 5th July to consider what further arrangements, if any, were necessary to ensure the continuance if possible the enlargement of the supply of munitions needed by the Russian army. The conference was unanimously of opinion that the loss of tonnage through the activity of the enemy&apos;s submarines had made it impossible for the Allies to discharge in full the obligations into which they had entered, and it was decided to ask Mr. Henderson and Mr. Root to represent the existing position to the Russian Government, assuring them at the same time that the determination of the Allies to do all in their power to assist the Russian army throughout the campaign on which it was now engaged, and the campaigns which may follow until the establishment of peace, was in no way abated by the difficulties which had, rendered the full realisation of their intentions impracticable.The Allies realise that their failure to maintain without interruption the supplies which both they and the Russian Government had reckoned is bound to throw an additional burden on the industries of Russia. They would in these circumstances be failing in their duties as Allies if they did not, in. a spirit of the most cordial sympathy, communicate to the Russian Government any suggestions for increasing the productivity of those industries which may seem to merit the consideration of the Government. In this spirit the conference invited Mr. Hender-son and Mr. Root to lay before the Russian Government the following observations, which being founded on experience may be of service to them in framing the measures which the situation appears to require.1. Transportation.The maximum number of locomotives and waggons which can be either maim-factured or transported to Russia by the United States by the end of this year, even when the fullest priority is given to Russian orders is respectively: 850 locomotives and 20,000 waggonsand as the actual requirements are stated by the Russian Government to be not less than 2,000 locomotives and 40,000 waggons, it is evident that the necessities of transport in Russia can only be met by more effective mobilisation and utilisation of the local resources in labour, material, and machinery.Probably one of the most effective means of remedying the situation would be the enlargement of the existing repair shops, the re-opening of those shops which have been partially or wholly closed and the creation of new ones at suitable points, and, further, an extension of the working hours for labour to two or three shifts per day.The Russian Government might institute at once a review of the existing facilities of machinery and the Allies would gladly do their best to make good any deficiencies thus disclosed in skilled labour and material.A comprehensive review of the possibilities of transport by river and canal might probably indicate means for relieving the congestion of the railways during the summer months.A plan for avoiding duplication of transport which it is understood has been prepared by the Russian Ministry of Industry and Commerce, should, if energetically carried out prove very effective in eliminating superfluous traffic.Motor Transport. As it is anticipated that the supply of motor transport from abroad will for the next few months be attended with the greatest difficulties, it is desirable that measures should be taken to improve the organisation of the existing service, especially with a view to the elimination of waste, and the prompt carrying out of repairs. The Allies will be glad to place at the disposal of the Department charged with this reorganisation any additional skilled labour or material which may be found to be required. As an immediate measure it is hoped that steps will be taken to prevent overloading and reckless driving of the existing motor transport. [849] E
2. Industrial Crisis.The problem of maintaining the output of the necessary commodities is rendered exceptionally difficult by the industrial crisis through which Russia is passing. This crisis is in a large measure due to the continual increase in the price of all materials, and to the unlimited demands made by the work-people who do not even accept the decisions of the Boards of Arbitration.The Russian Government are believed to be taking steps for fixing prices of the principal materials, and in the case of coal for purchasing the whole output and selling it at fixed rates. It is understood that Commissions will be formed for this purpose and these Commissions might with advantage act at the same time as Boards of Arbitration for determining wage questions.It is further understood that the Government are taking steps to create regular machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, and that the State as the party principally interested in the maintenance of industry, will in future more directly concern itself with the regulation of industrial questions. It seems probable that these two measures introduced together will prove efficacious in restoring to Russian industry the stability on which its productive power must ultimately depend.Information ha*s reached the Allied representatives that in some instances industrial troubles have been fomented by enemy agents among the prisoners working in the factories, whose movements do not seem to have been subject to adequate control.3. Allied Committee.The conference decided to establish in Petrograd a Joint Committee of Allied representatives to keep in touch with the Russian Government on all matters affecting the maintenance of supplies, and it is hoped that the Russian Government will communicate freely with this Committee and have no hesitation in utilising it to the fullest extent.APPENDIX B.Russian Parties.A number of Reactionary, Conservative, and Moderate Liberal parties that were prominent before the revolution have disappeared. There was a general sweep to the Left, and the Radical Constitutional Democratic party which, under the old regime, was on the Extreme Left of the active political parties was for months after the revolution on the Extreme Right. Guchkov, formerly leader of the Octobrists or Moderate Constitutionalists, and&apos; the first War Minister of the revolution, has since his fall been organizing a party more conservative than the Cadets. The bulk of the Moderates will probably take refuge in Guchkov&apos;s party. Of monarchical parties there is as yet no sign. From Right to Left, the existing parties are as follows: 1. The Constitutional Democrats or Cadets (Founded in October 1905) are Radicals with a broad social programme, including transfer of land to working farmers, and expropriation of big estates with compensation to the owners. Strongly pro-war and pro-Ally, they stand for decentralisation and for a large measure of autonomy to non-Russian nationalities, but they are opposed to federation and insist strongly on the unity of Russia. They have brilliant leaders, including Miliukoff who has gone, Shingareff, Nekrasoff, who are in the Government, and Maklakoff, who is not unlikely to go as Ambassador to Paris. The Cadets as a party have had some training in administration, but the rank and file have shown little vigour since the revolution either in party organisation Or in political activity.2. The Populist Parties.  These are Socialists of various shades whose chief interest is in the people (in the sense of the peasantry) and in a radical solution of the land question.(a.) The &quot; Trudbviki &quot; or Labour Group. The Labour group in the first Duma was a large and heterogeneous body, consisting mainly of peasants who were united on a programme of land nationalisation. In later Dumas it dwindled down to a small faction which included Socialist
i Revolutionaries, e.g., Kerenski. The group is now colourless and will probably disappear, the members drifting either to the Right into the Cadet party or to the Left into the Socialist Revolutionary party. (b.) Populist Socialists. A small group who seceded from the Socilaist Revolu-tionaries on a platform of denial of terrorism and advocacy of parlia-mentary action. Their chief representative is Pieshekhonov, Minister of Food Supplies.(c.) Socialist Revolutionaries. A large and popular party founded at the beginning of this century. In addition to the ordinary Socialist programme, it advocates the sweeping plan of land reform, including confiscation of private lands and their transfer to organs of local govern-ment (i.e., socialisation as opposed to nationalisation). Land for use only rent free to those who can work it without employing labour. Under the old regime the Social Revolutionaries were the terrorist party, but after the exposure of one of ther leaders, the agent-provocateur Azeff, the party crumbled to pieces. It revived its strength after the revolution. It is popular and very active, but is displaying a tendency to split into two factions mainly on the question of the war. The section that stands definitely for the war follows Kerenski. There is an extremist faction which plays fast and loose with the war question and echoes the cries of the extremist Socialist Democrats. Chernov, Minister of Agriculture, is a Social Revolutionary leader.3. Social Democfats.-The Social Democrats include a number of warring factions, some of them more bitterly at feud with each other than with the so-called bourgeois parties. The question of the war has made the grouping still more com-plicated. The main dividing line is that between the Bolcheviki and Mensheviki (majority-ites and minority-ites). The terms &apos;: majority &quot; and &apos;; minority &quot; relate to a congress held years ago in Switzerland and have no numerical application now. The congress marked the split between Lenin and Plechanov. The Bolsheviki are extremists as Socialists revolutionary and demand the immediate realisation of the maximum social democratic programme. The Mensheviki are as Socialists evolu-tionary, and aim for the present only at the Socialist minimum. But factions and factions are now in a fluid state.&quot;(a.) Bolsheviki is now the synonym for the noisiest and most extreme wing of the Socialists. They are certainly the most active party. They opposed participation in the Coalition Government and now violently attack the Socialist Ministers. Recklessly anti-war, pro-German, and anti-Ally. The followers of Lenin are even more extreme, but the two tendencies shade off into each other imperceptibly. German agents and reactionaries work under the Bolshevik flag.(&amp;.) The Mensheviki are split into two factions, internationalist pacificists and advocates of a war of defence. The Internationalists lean towards the Bolsheviki. Plechanov, the leader and theoretician of the Mensheviks, is unpopular with Socialists owing to his ardent advocacy of the war, and his group stands rather a,part from the rest. In the Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Deputies the Bolsheviki are numerically in a minority, but are influential through their energy.
