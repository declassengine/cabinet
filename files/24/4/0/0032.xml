BEXISTING AND PROSPECTIVE DEMAND FOR LABOUR FOR THE EXECUTION OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMES.IN thte following report an effort has been made to forecast the demand for labour for the various Government programmes for 1918, and to suggest the sources from which it may be obtained and the steps necessary to obtain it.In considering these demands it must be borne in mind that they represent additional men required, and that any men taken for the army from the trades making the demands must be replaced, and must consequently increase propor-tionately the demands put forward though not necessarily for men. It must also be borne in mind that the normal wastage due to death, retirement owing to age, &amp;c, has also to be made good, and this amounts to not less than 1 per cent, of the numbers employed.The various demands and other figures necessary for the proper consideration of the position have been presented in tabular form in a series of tables attached as Appendices.Tables (A), I and II (Appendix I), show the existing demand analysed by occupations and groups of industries, distinguishing the priority demand.Tables (B), I to VI (Appendix II), show the prospective demand for the year analysed, by Government programmes, distinguishing (so far as possible) between demands for skilled and unskilled men, and for women.Tables (C), I and II (Appendix III), show the labour supplied in each of the principal occupational groups during November 1917 and during the year 1917.Tables (D), I to V (Appendix IV), show the numbers enipkwed in, brought into, and enlisted from munition trades (including Admiralty work but excluding building) in each of the years 1914-15, 1915-16, and 1916-17.Table (E) (Appendix V) sets out the figures of certain imports during 1917.From these various tables it will be seen that there is an actual notified demand at the moment for all purposes for 96,000 persons, and a prospective demand for extended Government programmes in 1918 for 439,000 persons; that labour is being supplied for all purposes through the exchanges at the rate of over 5,000 per day (128,000 last month and 1,288,000 in the last ten months); and that a net addition of 915,000 persons has been made to the principal munition trades (excluding building) since July 1914.Before considering the labour demands to be met it will be useful to review briefly what has been done in the past three years of war with a view to obtaining some comparison between that and the efforts that lie before us. For this purpose the figures in Tables (D), I to V, are valuable; they may be briefly summarised as follows: 
the trades during the war amounts to 294,000, including a slight decrease in 1914-15, a very large increase in 1915-16, and a much smaller increase in 1916-17. The enlistments from the trades have declined each year, but the addition of women has reached surprising proportions, increasing each year, and amounting to a total increase of 621,000 in all or nearly three times the total numbers employed in 1914.   The number of women employed in 1917 is 848,000.In a report on labour requirements made in August 1916 to the Minister of Munitions by me as Director of the Labour Supply Department of that Ministry it was pointed out that there was at the time an actual demand for male labour amounting to about 36,000 and a prospective demand amounting to nearly 100,000, for munitions (including Admiralty) work.In the period July 1916 to July 1917 (which is the latest month for which these figures are available) the net addition to the number of men employed in the trades amounted to about 103,000. Consequently, allowing for men being reabsorbed in work after completing work on which they were engaged, and for variations in estimating demand, it will be seen that the demand then forecasted was fairly accurate and was, in fact, practically met. If the figures now under consideration are as nearly accurate, we are asked to face a net addition of about 250,000 men in these trades, 50,000 more than the addition made in 1915-16, and double the addition made last year. At the same time it is certain that the enlistment from the trades will be greater. Some 70,000 men are in addition required for the building trades, and the demands for women (including those for the various Women&apos;s Auxiliary Army Corps, Royal Flying Corps, Royal Naval Air Service, &amp;c.) will be very considerably greater.Existing Demand.The existing demand amounts to 96,000 persons, of which 91,000 is for men (58,000 skilled and 33,000 unskilled) and 5,000 women. The reason for the demands being in this proportion to each other is that they consist of the circulated demand (i.e., the demand which cannot be met locally) and of course it is easier to find unskilled than skilled men, and easier still to find women. Consequently the latter classes of demands are met locally to a greater extent than the first, and are not circulated. The demand is a real and ascertained one; it includes every kind of demand, Government and private, but having regard to the extent to which sub-contracting is carried on it is probable that the large bulk of it is for Government work, direct or indirect. Priority has been accorded by the National Labour Priority Committee to demands for 17,000 men.Prospective Demand.The prospective demand amounts to 439,000, of which 320,000 is for men (78,000 skilled and 242,000 unskilled) and 118,000 for women. The larger portion of this demand is for the increased programme of the Ministry of Munitions, which accounts for more than half of the whole. The other large demands are for the Admiralty and for the new shipbuilding programme, the Board of Agriculture for extension of agriculture, and the War Office for aerodrome and other constructional work. The rest of the demand is accounted for by the Office of Works for con-structional work and by the Timber Controller.These demands cannot, however, be taken at their face value. There is no doubt but that some of them represent far more men than could be absorbed. There is also no doubt but that some of the men required will be obtained from other work, which will come to an end during the period, e.g., men engaged on building work will become available for other building work as soon as their present jobs are over, and these jobs will be coming to an end month by month as the year goes on.   This materially affects the demands of 70,000 men for constructional work.There are, however, certain classes of the demand which will not be affected in this way, e.g., the men required for shipbuilding will be required all the time.All these prospective demands are given as put forward by the Departments concerned, and while that put forward by the Ministry of Munitions is no doubt the result of very careful thought and is based on the result of experience of preparing such demands extending over several years, the same cannot be said of all the others.There is, moreover, always a tendency to overstate labour demands on the part of contractors and of production departments, and there is the further point to
be borne in mind that the increasing difficulty in obtaining labour stimulates manufacturers to increased efficiency of factory working and extension of dilution and labour saving devices.Consequently the demands as now stated can safely be written down to some extent, though it must at the same time be borne in mind that increased production acts and reacts in very many different directions and causes increased activity in the production of all sorts of minor but necessary articles, to say nothing of control, distribution, and transport.iII.METHODS OF MEETING REQUIREMENTS.However much the prospective requirements for labour as set out above may be over-estimated, it is nevertheless clear that very large demands must be met if largely increased programmes for merchant shipbuilding (including marine engin-eering), aircraft, food production, and munitions generally are to be carried out for our own requirements and those of our Allies.And in the following paragraphs an effort has been made to indicate the possible steps that might be taken.1. Scrutiny of Programmes.The programme of every Government Department should be carefully scrutinised with a view to seeing whether there are any items which it is proposed to produce which could possibly be eliminated or postponed as not being absolutely essential. This might be undertaken by such a body as the War Priorities Committee, acting in co-operation with the Ministry of National Service as regards the man-power aspect of the question.In all the agreements between the Ministry of National Service and the pro-ducing departments it is laid down that new programmes and alterations in existing programmes should be reviewed by the Ministry of National Service. I am not aware that any programmes have m fact been submitted for such review, and such a course would appear to be essential.A step in the right direction has been taken by the appointment of the Sub-Committee to deal with work of construction, but the work of that Sub-Committee will be valueless unless immediate steps are taken to eliminate non-essential Govern-ment work.A similar course of action should be taken as regards other Government pro-grammes, and by this means some reduction in the total demand on man-power might well be effected.2. The Less Essential Trades.Much more drastic treatment of tne trades should be possible, and it is suggested for consideration whether it would not be practicable to allow manufacture of any sort only under licence.The Home Office possess an organisation which deals comprehensively with factories and workshops, and this organisation might well form the nucleus of the machinery for giving effect to such a scheme, in co-operation with and on principles laid down by the Ministry of National Service. A committee might be appointed at once to enquire into the practicability of the scheme and to suggest methods of working on broad and simple lines. If should, however, be given not more than a month in which to report.The licensing of building work is actually in force, and this should be made more stringent, and no work costing over 50Z. allowed without licence, it being understood that other than in verv exceptional cases no private building work would receive a licence.An alternative method to general licensing would be to ration trades through supplies of raw material or transport facilities. The first of these courses would However, probably necessitate a good deal of machinery not now in existence, but the second might be done by prohibiting the carriage of certain classes of commodities, sucn a scheme would not, however, be easy to administer.[1266] c
Another step which should be taken is a special joint appeal for men, giving definite numbers of actually ascertained vacancies with all details, this appeal to be made by the Ministry of National Service and the Ministry of Labour, to ali the 250 Local Committees established by the Ministry of Labour; each Committee should be asked to form sub-committees to deal with special trades or groups of trades in the locality in order to obtain from these trades men of the types required for the jobs actually available.It would result in 200 or 300 Committees all linked together by a common machine, working to fill actually ascertained vacancies available to all of them.In certain of these trades Trade Committees have been established by the Ministry of National Service. These Committees should be informed that they must produce a given percentage of men working in co-operation with the Ministry of Labour Committees.A complete scheme of working between certain of the Trade Committees and the Exchanges in order to secure co-operation has been agreed to, and a large number of vacancies will be given to these committees to fill almost at once.There can be no doubt but that the Building Trade offers a field for obtaining more labour by one method or another, e.g., by better allocation of contracts; by cutting down private work; or by attracting men from unessential work on which they are engaged at present.There were in July 1914 855,000 men employed in this trade; in October 1917 there were 425,000; of these 425,000 men only 180,000 are known to be employed on Government work.   This leaves 245,000 men unaccounted for.Assuming that of these 245,000 men large numbers are employed on indirect Government work, and that a further considerable number are too old to be moved, or are, for various reasons, unobtainable, there must remain several tens of thousands of persons who could be obtained for work of national importance.3. A Better System of Allocation of Contracts.A good deal of plant and labour now only partially employed or not employed to the best advantage might, it is thought, be brought into operation if the trades themselves were taken into consultation as regards the allocation of contracts. A start has been made in this direction with the building trades, and the argument has been fully developed in this connection. But it appears to have been forgotten that the starting of the big munition output was only made possible by bringing in every kind of small manufacturer into local groups all over the country, and that only by this means was it possible to hold on until the big national factories were ready.Manufacture in big factories is more efficient and economical, but it would appear now that there is room for both forms of production, and that contracts for many small articles or parts of articles could be undertaken by groups of traders. It is suggested that the Ministry of Munitions, Admiralty, and Air Board should be instructed to take up this question and to endeavour by this means to increase production and to diminish labour demand.4. Dilution of Labour.The extension of dilution and the real removal of demarcation restrictions in all trades must be pushed to the utmost possible limits. The Sub-Committee of the War Priorities Committee, which has recently been established to investigate the subject of dilution, should be instructed to proceed with the utmost possible despatch, and, on receipt of its recommendations, the necessary negotiations with the Unions should be undertaken without delay. To effect this it will probably be best to meet both the associations of employers and of workmen in the engineering, shipbuilding, building, woodworking, and other trades, to urge on them the importance of doing this and to get them to make agreements between themselves for the extension of dilution, and for the intervention of the Government only to be invoked if desired or if they are unable to make headway. It will, however, be preferable, and will be likely to lead to more rapid and satisfactory results if the trades themselves can be left to carry out the negotiations with each other.This will necessitate joint action by the Ministry of Munitions, Admiralty, and Ministry of Labour, and will only eventuate upon the initiation of the Ministry of National Service acting on the instructions of and with the support of the War Cabinet.
5. Importation of Foreign Labour.Every Department should be asked to give careful consideration to the possi-bility 01 employing foreign labour. There are a great number of foreigners already employed in this country, but in at least two directions the use of these could be extended. The use of Portuguese for timber felling could be increased by many thousands, and there is great unemployment in Denmark, where some 20,000 to 30,000 persons are reported to be out of work. The question of employing these Danes in agriculture in this country and in timber work should be immediately and carefully considered by all the Departments concerned.The various producing Departments should also be asked to consider whether there are not other sources of foreign labour which could be tapped, and which they could use.And in this connection the utilisation of Americans on a large scale should be taken into consideration. It is not as a rule practicable to mix American with English workmen in the same factories, on account of the wages difficulty. But it ought to be practicable to hand over certain factories bodily to the Americans to produce certain articles which are now imported (and thereby release tonnage) or of which a greater supply is needed, or which are being produced by workmen needed in, but now unobtainable, for other factories.This course has actually been adopted at Birtley, Co. Durham, where the entire shell factory is run and manned by Belgians, with most satisfactorv results.Our imports of certain articles in 1916 are shown in Table (E) attached, and it will be seen that over 400,000 tons of iron and steel manufacture were imported, in addition to 85,000 tons of machinery. Some of this might be saved by the course suggested above.6. Discharged Soldiers.Men are now being discharged from the army at the rate of between 20,000 and 30,000 a month. The bulk of these men are, of course, discharged on medical grounds, and consequently, cannot be regarded as immediately, or completely, suitable for a good deal of the heavy work which has to be done But a proportion of them must certainly be suitable to fill available vacancies, and, indeed, since April 1915, the Exchanges have placed in employment 76,000 such men It is, however, necessary that a more rapid, comprehensive, and thorough method of getting into touch with these men on discharge, either from discharge centres or from hospitals, should be agreed upon. The men should be brought into touch with work of national importance before they are given their actual discharge from the army in order that all possible influence may be brought to bear upon them to accept one or other of the many openings for which each man may be suitable, and where he is most wanted.It is accordingly suggested that the Discharge Centres should be re-established at centres where there is a large and well-equipped Employment Exchange aided by a strong Local Committee, and that arrangements should be made with the military authorities for interviewing the man as soon as he arrives at the Discharge Centre by a Trade Panel of the Local Committee with all available vacancies throughout the country before them.Employers should be told of this, and the scheme widely advertised; the men should, moreover (other than Pensions cases unfit for ordinary work), be passed to Reserve W. and enrolled as Army Reserve Munition Workers or War Work Volunteers, so as to ensure their going where men are most needed.If we could through this source direct to the most urgent works only a number equivalent to that obtained last year, we could get 45,000 men.   But by better arrangements we ought certainly to increase this by 50 per cent., or possibly . even to double it.7. The Release of Men of Low Categories from the Armies at Home.As soon as the Industrial Index of the Home Army, now in course of com-puation, is complete, a careful analysis should be made of the Index by occupations, in order to see how far actual demands can be met by the release of men.In order that this may be done, it is essential that this Index should be retained ?entzW and under skilled control; otherwise, it will not be possible to obtain from it rapidly and accurately the necessary information on which action could be based.
It will be necessary to arrange this with the Army Council at a very early date, and it will further be necessary to have an understanding with the &quot;War Office that men will, in fact, be released from the Home Armies for urgent work up to quite large numbers. A very large proportion of the constructional labour demands could be met in this way, besides many others,8. Irish Labour.There are still untapped sources of labour in Ireland, the main difficulty in the employment of these men being the reluctance of the employers over here to use them, owing to the fear of trouble with their own men. It should be considered whether works could be staffed almost entirely by this means, and whether negotia-tions could, not take place with the unions in order to smooth over the difficulties. Some 24,000 men have been brought over from Ireland in the course of the last year by the Ministry of Labour, and there are many thousands yet who might be obtained.0. Lancashire.Every effort should be made to utilise the labour thrown idle in Lancashire as a result of the restrictions on the imports of cotton, both by continuing every firm on work which can possibly be done in Lancashire mills,, thus employing the labour on the spot, and also by transferring labour to other districts. The transfer to other districts (which will be difficult) would be greatly facilitated if once it had been made clear that, at all events, a proportion would be employed locally.In this connection, it ought certainly to be possible for the Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty to carry out part of their extended programme as regards small articles, or parts thereof at all events, by having them manufactured in the Lancashire mills, instead of erecting new works or extending existing works, and instead of giving out contracts to people who cannot execute those at present in hand. The Air Board are taking steps for this purpose, but will only be able to absorb about 3,000 persons.10. V/omen.The use of women should be still further extended there is scope for this in many directions, in the Army, in the Eoyal Naval Air Service, other Admiralty establishments, agriculture, tramways, &amp;c. Each Department of State should be instructed to examine thoroughly all possible avenues for the use of women, whether by way of dilution or by way of substitution.So far as dilution is concerned, this is to some extent coverered by the sugges-tions under that heading set out in para. 4, but the action therein suggested should not prejudice the action suggested in the present paragraph.In order to preserve the supplies of women, and to utilise (them to the best advantage, the Central Control of Women&apos;s Recruiting should be brought into being without delay, and should really control, so as to prevent the lamentable waste now going on.Further, the services of the fifty or sixty committees for obtaining women (jointly established by the Ministry of Labour and the Home Office and now under the Ministry of Labour) should be utilised, and their efforts stimulated. It is under-stood that they are to act as sub-committees of the local committees formed by the Ministry of Labour throughout the country, and that where there are no such women&apos;s committees in existence, special women&apos;s sub-committees of the main Local Committees will be formed. Thev should be included in the joint appeal by the Ministry of National Service and the Ministry of Labour, which is suggested in para. 1, page 4.11. The extended use of Schoolboys for Agriculture in harvest time.As regards schoolboy labour, conferences have been held with public school masters, camp commandants, and others concerned, and a great extension of the numbers of schoolboys employed last year in harvest work should materialise next summer. The matter having been taken in hand at this early date should enable complete and suitable arrangements to be made in time, but it is impossible to start too soon in the efforts to induce the farmers to accept this form of labour. Some 4,000 boys were utilised in this way last year, and it is hoped that many times that number will be supplied in this way next year, both at Easter and in the summer.
12. Aliens.Man-power can be obtained by the proper utilisation of aliens to the following extent.Uninterned enemy aliens, of whom about 7,000 have enrolled as National Service Volunteers, can be utilised for sanitary and road work and agriculture.They should be able to replace certain types of men who could be *used on munitions and in employment for which uninterned enemy aliens would not be suitable.Prisoners of war are all fully utilised.Friendly and neutral aliens, as soon as we have the necessary legislation, should provide us with a body of from 20,000 to 30,000 men for light labouring work.An Order in Council is now being prepared, the effect of which should enable us to transfer aliens of this type, and to this number, provided employers will accept them. This order should be expedited.Every effort should be made to induce employers to accept these aliens, and the Ministry of Labour should be asked to instruct the Employment Exchanges to make enquiries of all likely employers in their respective districts as to their ability and willingness to use them.GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.It is impossible to estimate the number of persons whom it may be possible to draw from all the sources indicated above.From all sources, and for all purposes, the Employment Exchanges filled over 600,000 vacancies for men in the last ten months, but this covers every type of vacancy, including those due to filling gaps caused by wastage (which are very numerous), and also to the transfer of men wishing to change their occupation. These figures are analysed in Table (C) II.It is satisfactory to note that the figures show no diminution, but it is possible that they may not be maintained, or that they may not represent in the future exactly the sort of men required for the new programmes, and that the demands of the army will make it more and more difficult to get men of the type required. At all events it is known that many actual vacancies cannot be filled at present.It is accordingly necessary to utilise every possible source, and to take every possible step that can facilitate the production of fresh supplies, and it is therefore urged that careful consideration should be given to the various proposals put forward, in spite of their novel and, in some cases, drastic nature.(Signed)    C.
