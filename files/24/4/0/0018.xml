G.-168.7aWAR CABINET.IMPORTS AND EXPORTS (RESTRICTION) BILL.Interim Report No. 3 of a Committee appointed by the War Cabinet to consider the question op an economic offensive.(Previous Papers, Nos. G.-156, 158, 159, 160, 16.1, 166, 167, and War Cabinet 247,Minute 8.)1. THE Committee urgently recommend to the War Cabinet the immediate &quot;ntroduction of the Imports and Exports (Restriction) Bill drafted by the Board of Trade (Appendix). They consider that the powers conferred by this measure are ssential to the effective carrying out of any organised economic offensive, and that the ntroduction and passage into law of the measure will of themselves exercise an &quot;mportant influence upon that section of enemy opinion which is already regarding he economic future with apprehension.(Signed) E. CARSON, Chairm.au.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., November 3, 1917.APPENDIX.Imports and Exports (Restriction) Bill. Memorandum.The present powers of His Majesty as to prohibiting the importation and Exportation of goods are as follows : (1.) Under the Customs Consolidation Act he has power by Proclamation or Order in Council to prohibit the importation of any goods, but not to prohibit the importation of goods of any specified origin. (2.) Under section 8 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, he has power to prohibit absolutely the exportation of certain specified goods (arms, &amp;c), and this power has been extended by the Customs (Exportation Prohibition) Act, 1914, to all goods of any description, but the extension has effect only while a state of war exists. (3.) Under the Exportation of Arms Act, 1900, he has power to prohibit the exportation of certain specified goods to any country or place named in the order, and this power has been extended (a.) To the exportation of all goods of any description by the Customs(Exportation Restriction) Act, 1914 ; and (6.) To the exportation of goods to any such country or place unless consigned to particular individuals by the Customs (Exportation Restriction) Act, 1915.The extension has effect only whilst a state of war exists.The result is that immediately the war terminates there will be no power (1) to prohibit importation of goods of a particular origin; or (2) to prohibit exportation except
in the case of certain specified classes of goods; and most of the proclamations and orders relating to exports which have been made during the war, under the above-mentioned Acts, will cease to have effect.The practical effect of the present Bill is to continue for a period of five years [qu. twelve months] after the termination of the war, the powers which His Majesty Iras possessed and exercised during the war, adding, as regards importation, the power to prohibit the importation of goods of a particular origin. It is proposed to effect this by an entirely fresh enactment with a saving for orders, &amp;c, made under the existing enactments, rather than by continuing the operation of those enactments.A.D. 1917.
