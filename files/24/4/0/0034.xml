[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s fiovemment.1Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.SECRET.G.-183.mWAR CABINET.New Issues of Capital.Interim Report No. 7 of a Committee appointed by the War Cabinet to considerthe question of an Economic Offensive.(Previous papers Nos. G.-156, 158, 159, 160, 161, 167, 168, 170, 175, and 177, andWar Cabinet 247 (8), 265 (18) and (19), 273 (16), and 283 (17).)1. This Committee has been much occupied with the above matter. In theiropinion it is one of great urgency owing to the needs of the present situation andto the stringency with which the Treasury Committee for considering New Issuesof Capital has limited its assent to undertakings which are directly connected withthe war. The matter has been fully considered by a sub-committee, consisting ofthe President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Eeconstruction, and theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury.We attach hereto their report and recommendations, with which, after fulldiscussion, we have unanimously agreed.2. From the point of view of the Economic Offensive it is essential in ouropinion that not merely undertakings directly connected with the war, but alsoothers upon which the national well-being depends, or which involve expenditureof capital for urgent matters of reconstruction, should receive the Treasury consentmore readily and much more promptly than has been the case in the past. Wehave had before us various instances of delays and refusals which we cannot butregard as contrary to the national interest and indeed injurious to the successfulprosecution of the war.3. As the end of the war approaches, the question of the issue of fresh capitalfor the financing of necessary public undertakings, as well as for the legitimatesupport of the manufacturing community ijn this country, becomes of pressingimportance. Hitherto the system adopted by the Treasury Advisory Committeeon new Issues of Capital has practically had the effect of stopping all public issuesof capital, except those few which were directly concerned with the prosecution ofthe war.4. The manufacturers of this country, especially many of those in the engineering, metal, and chemical trades, will find themselves at the end of the&apos; war withlargely extended works, with a greatly increased number of workpeople to providework for, with raw materials scarce and very dear, and with inevitable creditsto be afforded to customers.5. Up to the present, by the postponement of the payment of Excess ProfitsTax, many manufacturers have been able to carry this financial burden, especiallyas the absence of book debts (through the Government in many cases being virtuallythe sole customer) has assisted them to face the position without any severe strain.6. But the payment of Excess Profits duty is now making many manufacturerslook round for relief. In order to regularise their position (which can only bedone by a funding operation), it is necessary for them to issue such further liquidcapital as will enable them to carry stock at high prices and grant credits to theircustomers. Applications for leave to make such issues should, we think, receivefavourable consideration.7. The requirements of the country for productive output will be very pressingduring and (still more so) after the war; while the opportunities for export of[1263]
manufactured articles at high prices will long continue to be an important factor in the re-establishment of the Exchanges. Anything, therefore, which leads to this result should meet with the fullest support, subject always to the paramount needs of war finance.8. Manufacturing for home consumption must also be provided for, although at the same time care must be taken not to stimulate consumption beyond the strictest needs of the community.9. It should be made clear, however, that the position will be entirely different as regards those claims for capital for foreign enterprise which, however good in themselves in normal times, may constitute a gold debit against this country without any countervailing immediate import of raw materials or foodstuffs. We do not suggest that in such cases there should be any change or relaxation in the present practice of the Treasury Committee for considering New Issues of Capital.10. It is perhaps hardly necessary to add that promoters&apos; schemes, purchase . of patents, fancy additions for the purchase of goodwill and other forms of watered j capita] should all be discouraged, and that only genuine immediate issues of capital i  for the purposes described should be sanctioned.11. For the above reasons, and as we regard the matter as one of great urgencv, we hope the War Cabinet may see its way to assent forthwith to the recommenda-tions of our Sub-Committee (Paper No. E.O.C-42.   Appendix).EDWARD CARSON( Chairman).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., December 6, 1917.
APPENDIX.E.O.C.-42. &apos;Report and Recommendations of the Sub-Committee on New Issuesof Capital.   .1 We have investigated the terms of reference of the New Issues Committee and the Treasury letter of instructions to them, and have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary nor desirable that either of them should be altered.   A copy of the&apos; terms of reference and the letter of instructions and names of the members areattached. . . , ,      &apos;.2. We recommend that cases m which new issues are recommended by a Government Department and not sanctioned by the New Issues Committee within a fortnight after the application shall be reported by the Secretary to the appropriateDepartment. . . .3. That a Committee of Ministers be constituted, to which the Minister responsible for any Department whose recommendation has not been accepted by the New Issues Committee may refer such cases for consideration and decision. 4. That the Committee of Ministers should consist of the following :  Financial Secretary to the Treasury. President of the Board of Trade. Minister of Munitions. Minister of&apos;Reconstruction.(Signed)A. H. STANLEY. C. ADDISON. STANLEY BALDWIN.December 6, 1917.Terms of Reference of New Issues Committee.In connection with the reopening of the Stock Exchange the Treasury have had under consideration the general conditions under which new issues of capital in the United Kingdom can be permitted during the continuance of the war:It appears to the Treasury that in the present crisis all other considerations must be subordinated to the paramount necessity of husbanding the financial resources of the country with a view to the successful prosecution of the war. Accordingly, they wish it to be understood that until further notice they feel it imperative in the national interest that fresh issues of capital shall be approved by the Treasury before they are made.Treasury approval will be governed by the following general conditions : (1.) Issues for undertakings carried on or to be carried on in the United King-dom shall only be allowed where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Treasury that they are advisable in the national interest.(2.) Issues or participations in issues for undertakings carried on or to be carried on in the British Empire overseas shall only be allowed where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Treasury that urgent necessity and special circumstances exist.(3.) Issues or participations in issues for undertakings carried on or to be carried on outside the British Empire shall not be allowed.(4.) The Treasury will not in ordinary cases insist upon the above restrictions where issues are required for the renewal of Treasury bills or other short instruments held here and falling due of foreign or colonial Governments or municipal corporations or railways or other undertakings.All applications should be made in the first instance to the Treasury.The Treasury will not be prepared to approve under paragraph 4 (3) of the temporary regulations for the reopening of the Stock Exchange anv dealings in new issues which have not been approved by the Treasury before they are made.Treasury,January 18, 1917.
Treasury Control of Fresh Issues of Capital.The approval of the Treasury should be obtained for all fresh issues of capital of whatever nature, whether made on behalf of a Government, municipality, or other public body, or any company, whether public or private. Treasury approval is not required for calls or instalments on shares, stock, debentures, or bonds already issued.- All applications for approval of fresh issues should be addressed to the Treasury, the envelope being marked &quot; Capital Issues.&quot; In order to save delay and reduce correspondence to a minimum it is desirable that the fullest particulars should be given in each case.Committee to consider and advise upon applications received by the Treasuryfor approval of fresh Issues of Capital.Lord Cunliffe, Governor of the Bank of England (Chairman).
