Memorandum by the Right Hon. G. N. Barnes, M.P.(Previous Paper, G.T.-1920.)IN continuation of the report submitted to me on the 31st August last (G.T.-1920), the Coal Controller has now, in response to a request I made, supplied me with the following information : I. Domestic Coal and Coke Supplies in London.On the 9th February the stocks in the area covered by the Metropolitan Coal Distribution Scheme were 327,601 tons, including 267,884 tons on the ground. Weekly deliveries vary between 95,000 and 100,000 tons, whilst the tonnage of orders unexecuted was 68,843 tons; that is to say, the coal merchants, who at this time of the year are normally two or three weeks in arrear with their deliveries, have less than one week&apos;s orders unexecuted.There is at present a surplus of coke in the London area, and an allowance of five tons of coke is permitted to anyone who will burn it in addition to the rationed allow-ance of fuel. There is an unreasonable prejudice against burning coke. There is also a difficulty in getting it to the consumer, because the gas companies are anxious to supply direct. The Coal Controller has suggested that they should use the coal merchants as their agents, and supply through them at a price which will enable them to make a reasonable profit.2. Distribution of Domestic Supplies in London.Practically no complaints have been received that even the poorest are unable to get fuel, and up to the present there have been no queues of people waiting for coal. This satisfactory result is attributed largely to the hearty co-operation of ths coal merchants in London and the assistance which has been rendered to the Controller by the Coal Porters and Carters&apos; Union.It is proposed to maintain the stocks now in hand, and in i^pril to start replenish-ing from current arrivals the cellars of those who can lay in considerable supplies. At the same time, it is considered desirable that it should be made compulsory for anyone who can store more than a certain amount of fuel to take a proportion of coke.3. Position of Public Utility Companies in London.The position of the public utility companies as regards supplies is not so satis-factory as that of domestic consumers, because, whilst the consumption of gas and electricity has materially increased, a large number of the ships which carry coal from the North-East Coast ports to London have been sunk and have not been replaced. But the Controller reports that the position is fairly secure, as the supply brought into London by rail can be increased, though not without difficulty, owing to the congestion of the, railways. Only one of the large companies has less than four weeks&apos; stock In hand.A public appeal has been made for economy in the use of gas and electricity, ihe Controller is now considering a scheme for bringing coal from Durham to Hull [266]
by rail, and thence to London by sea. Re attaches great importance to the replace-ment at the earliest possible moment of the ships which have been sunk and to the extension of the period of daylight saving, both at the beginning and end of summer. The 17th March was the date suggested by him as most suitable for reopening &quot; summer time.&quot;4. Position in the Provinces.The most difficult part of the country to handle as regards coal supplies has been the South-Eastern, Southern, and South-Western counties, owing to the fact that these counties have now to be supplied by rail, instead of by sea, as was largely the case before the war.As regards Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, the Coal Controller reports that there has been little cause for complaint. In the South-Western counties some oppo-sition was aroused because it was found necessary to obtain 70 per cent, of their coal from South Wales and Monmouthshire, and only 30 per cent, from the old sources of supply, the Midland Counties. This opposition was largely overcome as a result of an educative campaign, showing how South Wales coal could best be used, and also by taking a firm line with the factors and merchants in the trade, who were largely responsible for the opposition.The rest of the United Kingdom is more conveniently situated as regards coal-fields, and there has been less difficulty. Great assistance has been rendered by local committees set up in nearly 400 centres. These committees, which normally consist of the Mayor, Town Clerk, a member of the Council, the Chief Constable, a representative of merchants and a representative of labour, have safeguarded the supply of coal for the poorer classes. Steps are in contemplation to establish a system of rationing in the provinces similar to that which has been in force in London.5. Supplies to Munition Works, &amp;c.Heavy demands for increased supplies of coal are now being made by public &apos; utility companies in the provinces to meet the needs of munition works; and this, coupled with the fact that 50,000 men fit for general service abroad are to be taken for the Army makes the position a difficult one. Not only are the demands now made for increase in supplies of coal, but also for higher grades of coal than were consumed by the companies before the war. In South Yorkshire, Nottingham, and Derby the requests for additional supplies of coking coal made by the Ministry of Munitions have been so heavy that it has been necessary for the further sinking of pits to be sanctioned, in order to anticipate requirements towards the end of the year. The reduction in the output of munitions should give relief to the situation; but it would be of the greatest assistance to the Coal Controller if he could be informed at the earliest possible date of the places where reduction in output is to take place and the areas from which large numbers of men are to be combed out.Unless material economies are effected it may be necessary for industrial as well as domestic coal to be rationed, and it is therefore desirable that every effort should be made to supply the Coal Controller with the information which he requires.6. The Position in Ireland.The submarine menace has made the supply of coal to Ireland difficult.    Nor-mally supplies are shipoed from North and South Wales, Lancashire, and South-:  West Scotland.  At present there, is no shortage of coal which could be sent to Ireland, but the sea carriage of it presents a difficulty.   Supplies, when they have been landed, are carefully allocated to relieve the most pressing needs.7. Conclusion.Taking a general view of the situation, I think there is no doubt that it is a highly satisfactory one, and one which reflects the greatest credit upon the Board of Trade and the Coal Controller.(Initialled)     G.
