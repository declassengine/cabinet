IThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  November 1917.MOST SECRET.G.-176.WAR POLICY AND  CABINET BUSINESS.(Memorandum by Sir Edward Carson.)I DESIRE to draw the attention of my colleagues to the urgent necessity of a general review of our war policy.. We have lately received several weighty papers from our military advisers, and we have not discussed them. I am apprehensive if we allow matters to drift much longer circumstances will be too strong for us, and we shall be deprived of the opportunity of considering what our policy is to be. We G.T.-2653 have been warned by Sir Douglas Haig of the consequences of removing further and 2572. troops from the Western front. We have been warned by Sir William Robertson G.T.-2613. that while he agrees with the decisions which have been taken to send troops to Italy, we must bear in mind the possibility of having to cut our losses in Italy. Mr. Balfour in his paper of the 8th November pointed out the important questions which will arise if Italy and Russia go out of the war. Sir William Robertson in a paper G.T.-2630. of the 15th November indicated the limits of a successful advance in Palestine, and has pointed out that the German grip on the Turkish administration and the Turkish army gives slight hopes for the successful negotiations of a separate peace with Turkey, a view in which Lord Curzon concurs in his paper of the 16th Novem-ber. General Milne has forwarded a letter from the Greek Minister in Serbia stating that the Greek mobilisation is depending upon our assistance in food supplies, money, and material. There have been various rumours, confirmed by a secret report of the 8th November, that the enemy are planning an offensive in Macedonia in the spring, and a paper just received from Colonel E. A. Plunkett, General Staff, on the military situation at Salonica raises very grave and urgent questions as to our ability to resist an offensive there. Finally, the General Staff have indicated in G.T.-2687. a paper of the 17th November the directions in which the United States can be of G.T.-2654. most assistance to us. The situation is largely governed by the warning given by the First Sea Lord on the 9th October that our. strategy must be guided by the G.T.-2250. necessity of economising tonnage as far as possible. . I desire also to call attention to a paper by the Minister of Munitions of the 21st October, in which he points out G.T.-2436. that our munitions programme must depend upon our war plans for next j^ear, and asks for a review of the whole position. It seems to me to be urgently necessary to define our policy and to weigh very gravely the warnings we have received from the Chief of the General Staff and the Commander-in-Chief on the Western front as to the consequences of a further weakening of our forces in France and Flanders. At present we are drifting and are open to the accusation that not only have we not followed the advice of our military advisers, but have not even considered it. I do not think we shall be justified in waiting until the Inter-Allied War Council are able to advise us on the matters I have referred to above. General Foch is detained in Italy, while General Sir Henry Wilson is in Paris, and considerable time must elapse before we can hope to receive a considered review of the situation from them. In the meantime events in Italy may at any moment develop in such a way as to require the immediate decision of our policy. I appreciate the enormous amount of business which the Cabinet are expected to get through, and am alarmed at the many matters of detail which are allowed to absorb their attention (a subject, indeed, which deserves fuller consideration than I can give to it in this paper).I am particularly concerned at the few opportunities which the members of the War Cabinet have for private discussion,   Many matters of urgent moment arise from day to day which we ought to consider in private and decide without [1218]
delay, but to a great extent our time is taken up with elaborate conferences at which heads of Departments and permanent officials are present. I feel very strongly that the decision of matters of high policy and questions raised by the telegrams from day to day are our first charge, and that nothing should be allowed to stand in their way, and I would suggest that such a rearrangement of our methods should be made that some portion of each day should be devoted to uninterrupted conference by members of the War Cabinet.(Initialled)   E. C.2, Whitehall.Gardens, S.W., November 20, 1917.
