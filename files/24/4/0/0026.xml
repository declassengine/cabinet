[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.SECRET.G.-175.CONTROL OF RAW MATERIALS.Interim Report No. 5 of a Committee appointed by the War Cabinet to consider the question of an economic offensive.[Previous Papers Nos. G.-156, 158, 159, 160, 161, 166, 167, 168, 170, and War Cabinet 247 (8), 265 (18) and (19), and 273 (16).]1. THE chief feature of the economic situation at the conclusion of the war will be a serious world shortage, not only of foodstuffs, but of many of the essential raw materials of industry, and, to a large extent, of the necessary instruments of production and transportation. The problem will be still further complicated by difficulties of exchange.2. In the absence of any organisation or system of control there is certain to be a precipitate scramble among individual interests for raw materials and machinery. This will not only lead to wild fluctuations&apos; of prices, economic instability and labour complications, but will enable those who succeed in getting in first to secure enormous advantages over their competitors by being first able to set the wheels of industry, trade, and exchange in motion. The nations which will come off worst in this scramble are those which have already suffered most from the war, like Belgium and Northern France.   The handicap, once imposed, is likely to prove permanent.3. Nowhere will the shortage of industrial raw materials be so acute as in Germany and Austria. On the other hand, our enemies will unless the military situation should be completely transformed possess the great advantage of having the plant and equipment of their factories intact and ready to work at full pressure the moment the necessary raw materials can be secured. They have also retained intact, in their own harbours, a very considerable volume of shipping. There are abundant indications to show that they are fully alive both to the weakness and strength of their position, and are preparing to take most effective measures to remedy the former, if possible, and to exploit the latter to the fullest extent.4. The method that will apparently be pursued is that of restricting, as far as possible, for exchange reasons, all other importations except those of raw materials, and to entrust the purchase of these to State subsidised and controlled monopolist syndicates, which will be in a position to buy on the most advantageous terms, offering, for early delivery and large quantities, prices and conditions with which individual purchasers in Allied countries will not be able to compete. By these means it is hoped, not only to restart the internal trade in full volume, but to re-establish the German export trade, and with it the German exchange, so rapidly as to make good and more than make good, all the ground lost during the war.5. A subsidiary method, which is apparently being applied to a very considerable extent in Belgium and in the occupied industrial districts of Northern France, is the deliberate destruction or removal to Germany of the machinery and other equipment of factories, the object being to eliminate competitors during the most critical period of the reconstruction, and, possibly also in the case of Belgium, to secure financial, and industrial control by offering to re-equip the country with German machinery and plant. .6. Unless effective measures are taken to meet this organised German economic offensive at the conclusion of the war, it will succeed, not only in re-establishing Germanys industry and trade on a very favourable footing, but in permanently [13 87]
crippling some of the-weaker among the Allies and preventing their recovery from the economic and financial strain of the war. The necessity for taking such measures is, in the opinion of the Committee, self-evident and urgent.From this point of view the Allies, more particularly the British Empire and the United States of America, are in a particularly strong position. Between them they can control the world&apos;s supply of a large number of the most important raw materials of industry. Of the world&apos;s cotton production, for instance (1912-13 figures), 63&apos;9 per cent, came from the United States, 2S per cent, from the British Empire, including Egypt and the West Indies, which have practically a monopoly of the cotton used in the finer counts of yarn, and only &quot;004 per cent, from present enemy countries. As regards wool, the Allied production is 68&apos;5 per cent, of the total; neutral countries, more particularly the Argentine and Uruguay, being responsible for another 23&quot;3 per cent., and enemy production for 8&quot;2 per cent. In the matter of merino wool, however, which is a vital necessity for all the finer classes of textiles, the British Empire produces 63 per cent., and the Allies together 8!J per cent, of the total production. Jute is. an Indiam monopoly.. Rubber comes to the extent of over 90 per cent, from Allied sources. In copper and lead the Allies, mainly the United States and British Empire, produce 76&apos; per cent, of the total. In nickel Canada and New Caledonia produce 95 per cent, of the total. Of the world&apos;s petroleum production 89 jDer cent, is Allied, andionly 2*8 per. cent, enemy. In the case of all-these materials Germany is a large importer,, her demand ranging in most cases from 10 to 25 per cent, of the total output.8. These examples are sufficient to show that the Allies are in a position by organisation not only to ensure a reasonable supply of the essential raw materials of industry for themselves, even in spite of&apos; a serious general shortage, but also, if necessary, to cripple; or even-completely paralyse, the restoration of German industry, at any rate as far- as&quot; the export trade is concerned, though the home trade might conceivably be carried on with the help of inferior and more costly substitutes. The predominance of the Allies in&apos; respect of shipping and bunker coal could be utilised in order to-strengthen this control still further.9; An organisation which could secure such powers for the Allies will, in the opinion of the- Committee, not&apos; only be necessary for the defence of Allied interests against the-meditated German economic offensive, but will also provide a most effective lever- for bargaining: with the enemy in the peace negotiations, both for reasonable economic-terms as regards Belgium, France, and Serbia, and in other respects, and for the retrocession of occupied territories. The knowledge in Germany that such an organisation is being taken in hand will be a most important, possibly even a decisive, factor in shortening the war, and in moderating German claims when it comes to the actual settlement.10. The proper organisation of the supplies of raw materials, involving the organised&apos; solution of the connected problems of exchange and of the provision of the instruments of&apos;production and transportation, is, in the opinion of the Committee, desirable in the interests of the producers of foodstuffs and raw materials, both in the British Empire and in Allied countries, no less than in that of the industries which consume those materials. The producing countries will, on the conclusion of the war, urgently require financial and shipping facilities, rolling-stock, mining, and other machinery. To have to scramble for these things among themselves and in competition with neutral and enemy countries would be a serious handicap to their development. It is the lack of these things which is, in fact, at this moment confronting them all with far greater difficulties than any arising out of the loss of the enemy market. That loss, indeed, has been largely made good by the fact that, with the replacement of enemy manufactures by Allied manufactures, the Allied demand for their raw materials has increased, a factor which will come into play even more strongly after the war. From the point of view, moreover, of their programmes of development and immigra-tion, definite and comprehensive arrangements for the disposal of their produce at good prices over a period of years will be preferable to the chance of a temporary forcing up of the prices of certain articles by unregulated competition, set off by all the other disadvantages of an unorganised system, and followed by sudden acute depressions.11. The acutal detailed methods by which the control of Allied, and, as far as possible, neutral supplies of the principal raw materials can be most effectively secured, consistently with the interests of producers in the British Empire and in Allied&apos;countries, as well as of the British and Allied industries affected, will require careful investigation.   Precedents have been furnished by some of the existing war
controls of certain raw materials and foodstuffs which might be modified and adapted to meet post-war conditions.12. An essential preliminary, in any case, to the proper working of any system of control after the war is the introduction of legislation by which the Governments con-cerned can control both the volume, direction, and priority of their exports and imports by license. A Bill to secure this has recently been introduced in the House of Commons, and the attention of the Dominion Governments has been drawn to the desirability of securing the passage of similar legislation. The time has come when, in the opinion of the Committee, it is desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to approach the Allies, and more particularly the Government of the United States, with a view to ascertaining how far they are prepared to consider the necessity of. creating a common organisation for securing the control of the supplies of the principal raw materials and of the instruments of production and transportation, in order to deal with the difficulties of the economic situation at the end of the war, and the special dangers arising out of the German economic offensive, and, as a first step towards this, of arming themselves with the legislative powers required to carry such a policy of organisation into effect(Signed) E.
