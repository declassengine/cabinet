Printed for tie War Cabinet.   September 1917.SECRET.7G. 158.MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC  OFFENSIVE,  BY SIR EDWARD CARSON.I AM informed that there is considerable unrest caused by the failure of the Government to take any action to carry into effect the resolutions -passed at the Paris gkt.-44S Economic Conference in June 1916. &apos;  For convenience of reference I append the most important of the Paris resolutions at the end of this paper.In order to show how little has been accomplished in spite of the lapse of fifteen months, it is necessary to relate in some detail the steps which have been taken to give effect to these resolutions.The Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy, set up under the chair-manship of Lord Balfour of&apos; Burleigh, presented an interim report to the late  .t.-465. Prime Minister on the 9th November, 1916, on the question of the importation of goods from present enemy countries after the war, and recommended a system of prohibition for a period of at least 12 months, with power to grant licences in special cases. The Committee also issued a special report to the present Prime Minister on the 2nd February, 1917, on the subject of imperial preference, accom- g.t.-58. panied by the following resolutions: (1.) In the light of experience gained during the war, we consider that special steps must be taken to stimulate the production of food-stuffs, raw materials, and manufactured narticles, within the Empire wherever the expansion of production is possible and economically desirable for the safety and welfare of the Empire as a whole. . (2.) We therefore recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should now declare their adherence to the principle that preference should be accorded to the products and manufactures of the British Overseas Dominions in respect of any customs duties now or hereafter to be imposed on imports into the United Kingdom.(3.) Further, it will, in our opinion, be necessary to take into early considera-tion, as one of the methods of achieving the above objects, the desirability of establishing a wider range of customs duties which would be remitted or reduced on the products and manufactures of the Empire,, and which would form the basis of commercial treaties with Allied and Neutral powers.No action was taken to carry out the recommendations of this report until the Imperial Trade Policy Committee was set up at the end of August under the chairmanship of the Colonial Secretary.   The Committee has held only one meeting  on the 22nd August at which the following terms of reference were proposed:  &quot; To empire into and report upon the best methods and machinery by whichto give effect to the following resolution of the Imperial War Conference: i.w.c. 12&quot; The time has arrived when all possible encouragement should be (16)-given to the development of Imperial resources, and especially to making the Empire independent of other countries in respect of food supplies, raw materials, and essential industries.. With these objects in view the Conference expresses itself in favour of the principle that each part of the Empire, having due regard to the interests of the Allies, shall give specially favourable treatment and facilities to the produce and manu-factures of other parts of the Empire.&quot; The Committee then adjourned until, after the. recess.Lord Balfour&apos;s Committee, on the other hand, has not yet published its final Report.   In the meantime,, the French Government, in a note addressed to Mr. -oaliour, through the French Ambassador on the 16th April, proposed, in order to [994] -r
F.O. 79010. give effect to the resolutions of the Paris Conference, to denounce commercial treaties between France and foreign countries on the grounds that it would not otherwise be possible to abolish the most-favoured-nation clauses, which such treaties contain, and suggested that the Allied Governments should take the same course (the Italian Government having already taken steps in this direction). The French Government therefore proposed that the Allied Governments should confe with a view to denouncing their treaties simultaneously, and asked for the view of the British Government on these proposals as soon as possible. It was urged that France must act immediately, in consequence of a clause in most of the Frenc treaties requiring one year&apos;s notice. So far as I am aware, no answer has yet been given to the French Government.As stated in a Foreign Office Memorandum of the 31st August, the matter wa referred to the Board of Trade, who expressed the view in a letter of the 12nd June in which the Foreign Office concurred, that it would be undesirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to denounce all existing treaties with foreign States as suggested by the French Government. The Board of Trade submitted a memoran dum at the end of July for the consideration of the War Cabinet, urging that an exchange of views should take place either in Paris or London between the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, for the purpose of considering the common policy of securing control and providing for the allocation between the Allies ol the supplies of food-stuffs and raw materials immediately after the war. This was put down on the provisional list of subjects for the consideration of the War Cabinet on the 30th July, but was withdrawn at the instance of Lord Robert Cecil on the understanding that Lord Robert Cecil, Sir Albert Stanley, and Dr. Addison should discuss the matter.It is now fifteen months since the Paris Conference, five months since the French Government asked us to agree to a Conference for denouncing treaties, and two months since tine Board of Trade urged a conference between the three Powers. I submit that a decision on the matter should be taken immediately.Hitherto, attention has mainly been concentrated on the reconstruction period after the war, but the view was expressed in a paper submitted bv Mr. Ernest Pollock on Trade War, dated the 27th June, 1917:-F.O.172533/C/ \t     150.yG.T.-1492.Letter from Mr. Locock to Col. Hankey, 3rd Aug., and from Col. Dally J ones to Mr. Locock, 8th Aug.G.T.-1447.&quot; That measures should be taken now to exploit the alarm already mani-fested by Germany at the idea of post helium trade war and the retardation of their commercial recovery, by the creation of a weapon to permit of such&quot; a war being waged more effectively if so desired. There may be differences of opinion as to the expediency of using such a weapon when forged, but there should be as little disagreement as regards the desirability of its creation as there would be in regard to the desirability of maintaining an army and a navy.&quot;F.O. Paper        I entirely agree with this view, which is supported by Professor Max Muller I0882,p. 11. in his monthly report for July on the economic situation in Germany, issued last week: &quot; The whole problem of economic reconstruction (&apos; Uebergangswirtschaft.&apos; as the Germans call it) occupies a great deal of attention in the Central Empires. The central difficulty which is agitating the German Government is the pro-vision of the raw materials indispensable to the renewal of their industrial life and export trade. Raw materials are essential to industrial employment, and demobilisation is difficult and dangerous till employment can be provided for the discharged soldier. The problem of the acquisition of raw materials is greatly complicated by the low value of the mark. Before the entrance of the United States into the war the difficulties did not seem insuperable, but that event, with the resulting concentration of economic power in the hands of Germany&apos;s enemies, as was frankly stated at a recent meeting of the Reich-tag Committee for Trade and Industry, demolished the German reconstruction policy. The realisation of the difficulties which Germany and Austria-Hungary will encounter in rehabilitating their industry and commerce is doubtless one of the chief reasons of the overtures of a peace of &apos; reconciliation guaranteeing the renewal of commercial relations between the Central Power? and their present enemies on favourable terms.&quot;The &apos; Frankfurter Zeitung,&apos; in discussing . Germany&apos;s peace aims, definitely states that her economic aims are much more important than her geographical aims, and constitute &apos; the central questions of the future peace.&apos; Germany, it says, must secure the  absolute right of settlement in foreign
22countries, and complete freedom to import raw materials, and must defeat the economic schemes of her enemies by securing most-favoured-nation treatment.&quot;- .In considering how we can best profit from the fears which undoubtedly exist Germany as to their commercial future, we should have two distinct objects iniew: (1.) To convince Germany that the longer the war continues the worse will beher commercial prospects after the war, and (2.) To prepare for the Allies a sound economic foundation to serve as a basis for negotiation when serious peace proposals are being discussed.As to (1), we certainly have it in our power to frighten commercial interests Germany by threatening Germany with an economic offensive both during and ifter the war.As stated in Mr. Pollock&apos;s memorandum: &quot; What is required is real damage to the prospects of recuperation, damage by measures which were obviously bound up with the duration of hostilities, and damage which was of a progressive character, so that every additional month of war meant an increase in the harm done.&quot;Mr. Pollock proceeds to show how the policy can be developed, with the co-opera-;ion of the United States, by the capture of the markets of South and CentralIAmerica, by the establishment of the British Trade Corporation and the British Metal Bank, and by the formation of a board of financial and commercial experts working in close co-operation with our Allies, to devise means of damaging German prospects such as the buying up of supplies or sources of raw material. The paper further states: &quot; The only problem is whether in fact a substantial effect can be produced. All our evidence -points both to the possibility of producing such an effect and to the present sensitiveness of German opinion in this direction.&quot;The second consideration (2) is that when serious peace negotiations are legun we shall almost certainly find that the enemy is in possession of large tracts lot&apos; allied territory, and that economic concessions to Germany will be all we pave to offer in exchange. It is therefore essential that our economic position lliould be as strong and well organised as possible. I again quote Mr. Pollock&apos;s inemorandum: &quot; It is on post helium opposition that German alarm has at present concentrated.&quot; Nor is this surprising. If Germany is unable to secure &apos; most-favoured-nation &apos; treatment, this would be sufficiently serious for German prospects were it confined to the British Empire. It would represent an almost impossible obstacle to German recovery were Germany faced by a combination of Great Britain, the United States, France, and the various lesser Powers which would probably be drawn inevitably into such a group. As a result, in the degree in which trade war after hostilities is a real possibility when peace negotiations are begun, in that degree the Allies possess a most &quot;important counter for the purposes of negotiation.&quot;, I am not, in this connection, concerned with what is to be our actual trade policy after the war. That gives rise to an entirely different series of considerations, ind no doubt there are strong arguments against &quot;a continuation of trade war after lie war, some of which are set out in the memorandum on post-war commercial ohcy issued by the Reconstruction Committee, the validity of which can onlv be G.T.-1603. -ested after very careful enquiry;, but I am convinced that for war purposes &quot;it is jSsential that we should immediately organise the economic resources of the British unpire, of our Allies, and of the United States, and that, as a preliminary step ; coherence of representatives of Great Britain, France, and the United&quot; States ; louicl be held immediately to discuss the whole position, and particularly to decide n a common policy with regard to the denunciation of &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; causes m our treaties with foreign countries  .[994] &quot; B 8
Preparations for the organisation of our economic resources should be under taken at once by the Board of Trade, and as soon as the new Department of Com mercial Intelligence, over which I understand Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland is t preside, is in working order, the work of preparing an economic offensive might well be transferred to it, since the intermediate position between the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade makes it speciallv suitable for the purpose.---    &apos;      E. C.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 20, 1917.EXTRACT FROM RESOLUTIONS  OF  THE  PARIS  CONFERENCE.Whereas the war has put an end to all the treaties of commerce between th-Allies and the enemy Powers, and whereas it is of essential importance that, durin; the period of economic reconstruction which will follow the cessation of hostilities the liberty of none of the Allies should be hampered by any claim put forward by tli enemy Powers to most-favoured-nation treatment, the Allies agree that the belief] of this teatment shall not be granted to those Powers during a number of 3-ears to I: fixed by mutual agreement among themselves.During this number of years the Allies undertake to assure to each other, s far as possible, compensatory outlets for trade in case consequences detrimental t their commerce result from the application of the undertaking referred to in tli proceeding paragraph.The Allies declare themselves agreed to conserve for the Allied countries, befoi all others, their natural resources during the whole period of commercial, industrial agricultural, and maritime reconstruction, and for this purpose they undertake t establish special arrangements to facilitate the interchange of these resources.In order to defend their commerce, their industry, their agriculture, and thei navigation against economic aggression resulting from dumping or any other mod of unfair competition, the Allies decide to fix by agreement a period of time durin which the commerce of the enemy Powers shall be submitted to special treatmer and the goods originating in their countries shall be subjected either to prohibitioi. or to a special regime of an effective character.The Allies will determine by agreement through diplomatic channels the specie conditions to be imposed during the above-mentioned period on the ships of tli enemy Powers.The Allies will&apos; devise the measures to be taken jointly or severally for preven&apos; ing enemy subjects from exercising, in their territories, certain industries c professions which concern national defence or economic independence.Permanent Measures of Mutual Assistance and Collaboration amona the A HieThe Allies decide to take the necessary steps without delay to render themselv independent of the enemy countries in so far as regards the raw materials an manufactured articles essential to the normal development of their econom activities.These steps should be directed to assuring the independence of the Allies in only so far as concerns their sources of supply but also as regards their financia commercial, and maritime organisations.The Allies will adopt the methods which seem to them most suitable for t! carrying out of this resolution, according to the nature of the commodities an having regard to the principles which govern their economic policy.They may, for example, have recourse either to enterprises subsidised, directei or controlled by the Governments themselves, or to the grant of financial assistant for the encouragement of scientific and technical- research and the development ( national industries and resources, and Customs duties or prohibitions of a temporal or permanent character, or to a combination of these different methods.Whatever may be the methods adopted, the object aimed at by the Allies is \ increase production within their territories as a whole to a sufficient extent to enab&apos; them to maintain and develop their economic position and independence in relation to enemy countries.
Whereas for the purposes of their common defence against the enemy the Allied Powers have agreed to adopt a common economic policy, on the lines laid down in the resolutions which have been passed, and whereas it is recognised that the effec-tiveness of this policy depends absolutely upon these resolutions being put into operation forthwith, the Representatives of the Allied Governments undertake to recommend their respective Governments to take without delay all the measures, whether temporary or permanent, requisite for giving full and complete effect to this policy forthwith, and to communicate to each other the decisions arrived at to attain that object.
