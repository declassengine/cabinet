IS / I[This Document is the Property of. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.?Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.SECRET.V7G.-170. ^     7WAR CABINET.CONTROL OF SHIPBUILDING AFTER THE  WAR.Interim Report No. 4 of a Committee appointed by the War Cabinet to consider theQuestion of an Economic Offensive.[Previous Papers Nos. 156, 158, 159, 160, 161, 166, 167, 168, and War Cabinet247 (8), 265 (18) and (19).]THE Committee have had their attention drawn to the necessity for prompt action in dealing with the situation which may arise at the end of the war from Allied and neutral orders for ships now being placed with our shipbuilding firms. The question has been rendered more particularly acute by a recent Norwegian law by which Norwegian shipowners are practically compelled to reinvest in shipping the proceeds of sales of ships or the insurance money received for lost ships. Large orders at very high prices are consequently being hurriedly placed with British shipbuilders. That we should secure orders of this kind is, in itself, a very desirable matter for the shipbuilding industry. ,2. It is, however, obvious that if we are to maintain our position in the world&apos;s mercantile shipping, a very large proportion of the output of our shipbuilding yards, during the reconstruction period, must be reserved for ships built for service under the British flag.3. A certain proportion of our output, moreover, will have to be reserved for our Allies and for neutrals who have rendered, or may render, useful services. The promise of shipbuilding facilities is one of the most valuable means of bargaining we have with neutral shipowners.4. It is clear that these various objects can only be attained if there is some arrangement for determining priority in the execution of orders during the reconstruction period. . The necessity of Government control to effect this is urged by the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Shipping, Sir Clarendon Hyde&apos;s Sub-Committee appointed by the Ministry of Reconstruction, and Mr. Hichens&apos;s Committee on Neutral Tonnage appointed by the Foreign Office, and it is understood that the draft report of Sir A. Booth&apos;s Committee on Shipping and Shipbuilding after the War, appointed by the Board of Trade, will comprise a recommendation to the same effect.5. The Committee are advised that during the wrar period all that is necessary can be done by a regulation under the Defence of the Realm Act, providing that nc work should be begun or continued on a contract for post-war construction withou the consent of the Shipping Controller, and that all contracts (both past and future entered into for post-war construction should be notified to the Ministry of Shipping or the Board of Trade.   The draft heads of such a regulation are given in Appendix ij6. In order to deal with the situation after the war it will, however, be necessary to introduce legislation giving the Ministry of Shipping or the Board of Trade powei to determine the priority in which ships may be built, in order that the needs of our own Mercantile lVIarine, of our Allies, and of neutrals can be met on the basis of a system of &quot; rationing.&quot;   A draft outline of such a measure is given in Appendix II.7. If the necessity of such control is admitted the Committee consider it of importance that a dejinite statement should be made on* the subject without delay, in order that both shipbuilders and Allied and neutral shipowners may understand the conditions under which contracts may be accepted. The Committee therefore recommend to the War Cabinet that such a statement should be made at the earliest opportunity, and should be accompanied by the issue of a Regulation under the [1152]
Defence of the Realm Act on the lines indicated, and by the introduction of a Bill securing to the Government control over the priority of the execution of shipbuilding contracts during the reconstruction period.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., November 7, 1917.APPENDIX I.Draft Heads of Regulation under Defence of the Realm Act.*1.
