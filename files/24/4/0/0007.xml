October 1917.SECRET.G-157.MEMORANDUM ON PACIFIST PROPAGANDA BY SIR EDWARD CARSON.(Previous papers, Nos. G.-101, G.-102, and G.-103.)IT is, I think, desirable that the Cabinet should have fuller information as to the nature of the pacifist propaganda which is being carried cn throughout the country, and the identity of those who take part in it. The matter is necessarily intertwined with the whole question of labour unrest. The following sources of information are available: The Ministry of Labour,The Labour Section of the Ministry of Munitions,The Shipyard Labour Department of the Admiralty,The Military Intelligence Branch of the War Office,The Naval Intelligence Division of the Admiralty,The Criminal Investigation Department at Scotland Yard.The only one of these which furnishes regular information to the Cabinet is the Ministry of Labour, which issues a weekly report. The Ministry of Labour, however, are., necessarily more closely associated with the properly accredited Trades Union officials, and are less in touch with the various more recent labour organisations which appear to be the principal field of operations for pacifist propaganda. It is important that the Cabinet should have as full information as possible of the following organisations : The Union of Democratic Control, The Independent Labour Party, The No-Conscription Fellowship. The Industrial Workers of the World, The Rank and File Movement, The Shop Stewards Movement,and others of a similar character. The report of the Commissioners on Industrial Unrest went fully into the causes which have created an atmosphere in which industrial agitation flourishes, but I am not convinced that those causes alone would have produced the dangerous symptoms which exist in the country, without some powerful driving force to make them effective. I think that the Cabinet should have reports from the various Secret, Services to show whether there is any evidence at al1 that the enemy are supplying funds, either directly or indirectly, for the pacifist propaganda. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the Germans have been very active in promoting industrial trouble in Russia, in Italy, in Spain, in the United States, in the Argentine, and in Chile, in fact, wherever conditions were suitable For their interference. The allegations in the Bolo Pasha case, if true, disclose widespread activity in France. We have no ri^rht to assume, without very careful enquiry, that this country has been free from similar attentions. It is almost unnecessary to point out that it does uot follow that because no connection can be traced between those who are actually engaged in paciiist propaganda and the enemy that no connection exists. It may well be that the pacifists themselves are innocently receiving funds from German sources without being aware of the fact. I recommend that a report shall be compiled in the Home Office and supplied to the War Cabinet every week from materials obtained from the authorities mentioned above. Unless we are supplied with the fullest information, it will be exceedingly difficult to counteract pacifist propaganda effectively.(Initialled) E. C2, Whitehall Gardens, S W., October 3, 1917.o
