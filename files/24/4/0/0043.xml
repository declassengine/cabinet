COMPULSORY RATIONING.Memorandum by the Food Controller.IN my original memorandum of the 9th November on the introduction of compulsory rationing (G.-171), it was suggested that the post offices should undertake some part of the work involved in the distribution of food cards. The Postmaster-General, however (see my note of the l4th November), found himself unable to agree to this, and it became necessary, therefore, to examine further the machinery required for the purpose of a general rationing scheme.The position has been further altered by the rapid decline in the supplies of meat and fats and by the consequent necessity of giving immediate powers to Local Food Control Committees to deal with the distribution and consumption of food within their areas with a view to the prevention of queues.The necessary powers were given by- an Order made on the 22nd December, and are being widely exercised. The existence of these powers, while it enables rationing of a provisional type to be brought into force locally &amp;i an earlier date than would otherwise have been possible, at the same time postpones the date at which it is possible or desirable to introduce a uniform and national system of rationing.In the light of these changed conditions, it is desirable that Food Control Committees should be urged to introduce local schemes of rationing under the Order of- the 22nd December in respect of all articles of which there is a shortage (in particular meat and fats). In practice Committees generally have realised the difficulties of local schemes limited to small areas, and are combining in large aggregates to - frame uniform schemes covering whole industrial districts. In this all possible assistance is being given by the Ministry of Food. A uniform scheme to deal with meat and fats is being introduced for London and the Home Counties (which will in itself cover a quarter of the population of Great Britain). This scheme is based upon the issue of individual cards. A similar scheme is contemplated to cover practically the whole of Scotland. In the West Midlands and on the North-East Coast schemes based on the use of household cards are already in operation, and from all other parts of the country schemes are coming forward. There is every ground for believing that by the end of February or the first, half of March practically the whole country will be covered by local rationing schemes, dealing in all cases with fats, in many with meat, and in some cases with other articles also.While local schemes are thus being started for certain articles there has been in operation since the 1st January a national and uniform system of rationing for sugar, which has already gone far to remove the causes of discontent formerly existing. In this the post offices are rendering valuable assistance in dealing with persons who leave the households in which they were registered. The existence of this scheme makes it possible in due course to absorb all the local rationing schemes into a national system of rationing for all essential foods, and I contemplate that this should in fact be done at a reasonably early date. That is to say, at a fixed date all the food cards under local schemes will be called in, as also will the national sugar tickets, and holders of the latter will, in exchange for their sugar tickets, receive a set of ration cards with coupons for the various foods included in the rationing system. .   ,A summary of the proposed system is given in Appendix (A), with which I circulate also a copy of a Report on the Scale of Rations prepared by a Departmental Committee (Appendix (B)). ..&apos;Briefly, I contemplate a national system of compulsory rationing with a uniform scale of rations in all districts and uniformity in respect of the essential documents (cards and coupons), but administered through the Local Food Control Committees, the latter will undertake all the responsible local work ; in particular, the grading of workers^ entitled to higher rations under the scale, the control of retailers, the replace-ment ot lost cards, and the dealing with complaints and difficulties generally. At the [199]    1
fsame time uniformity in essentials will be enforced by central instructions and by a central inspectorate.It is not necessary to decide at this moment the date at which the various local schemes shall be absorbed into the national system, and it may even be found possible to have a different date for different districts. In any case, the schemes themselves are being framed so as to allow of considerable elasticity as to their currency. Clearly, however, it is not now either necessary or desirable that the transition from local to national rationing should take place as early as the end of March (the date suggested in my original memorandum). The local schemes should have at least two or three months&apos; run, during which invaluable experience will be gained.In respect of the articles to be rationed the local schemes, under the Order of the .22nd December, will probably deal with meat and fats only. The national scheme is being framed so as to cover all cereals, meats and fats, and sugar. Weighty reasons have been advanced to me for postponing to as late a date as possible the rationing of cereals, and T do not desire to include cereals unless this is inevitable. The machinerv required will, however, be very much the same whether cereals are included or not,I should add that, as an accompaniment to the local schemes under the Order of the 22nd December, I am taking steps as rapidly as possible to secure the fair distribution of meats and fats as between different areas. This is obviously of the first importance. Emergency adjustments of distribution are being made on the basis of population, indicated by the sugar card distribution, and I hope shortly to establish for every district in the country its proper quota of food supplies, leaving it to the local Committees to secure the correct distribution. I must, however, state that, in view of the great number and variety of existing trade channels, the readjustment of distribution is a matter of very great difficulty, and cannot be brought about in a moment.I ask authority from the Cabinet accordingly to proceed on the lines I have suggested, and in particular (a.) To introduce, as from the most convenient date, a national system of compulsoryrationing covering meat and fats, in addition to sugar. (b.) In setting up the machinery for this, to make all necessary preparations forincluding also cereals, on the understanding that, before actually rationingcereals, I should report again to the Cabinet for their assent, (c.) To incur all the expenditure necessary for these objects, including the settingup and staffing of any necessary offices.RHONDDA.Ministry of Food,January 24, 1918.APPENDIX (A).Summary of Scheme for Compulsory Rationing, January 24, 1918.1. National System Administered Locally.The scheme proposed is a national system of compulsory rationing of all essential foods administered through Local Food Control Committees.2. Rationed Articles.The articles proposed to be included at the outset are, meat, fats, and sugar, and (if necessary), bread, and all cereals. The machinery is, broadly, the same whether bread and cereals are included at the outset or not.3. Scale of Rations.The scales of rations, are dealt with in the Special Report on Ration Scales (Appendix (B)). Briefly, it may be stated that the population is divided according to occupation, age, and sex, into five classes, to each of which different rations are assigned; thus while men on heavy work get altogether as much as 12 lb. of bread, meat, and cereals, fib. of fat, and lb. of sugar in a week, the &quot;normal ration,&apos; covering about two-thirds of the total civilian population, is only 8 lb. of bread, meat, and cereals,  .1b. of fat, and I- lb. of sugar.
4. Individual Cards and Coupons.The machinery of the system is based on the two main principles of (a.) Individual registration.(6.) The use of cards with-detachable coupons for purchases.That is to say, each individual, according to his class, will be able to obtain from time to time cards with detachable coupons representing the ration to which he is entitled, and will be required to present these whenever a purchase of rationed foods is made, so that the appropriate number of coupons may be detached and retained by the retailer. The latter in turn must account for his sales by producing the coupons to the local food office, and is thus prevented from selling illegally and outside the ration.5. Machinery for Issue of Cards.The methods of issuing ration cards may be summarised as follows : (a.) Every person will have a permanent ration paper issued by the Central Index Department of the Ministry of Food (already established under the Sugar Distribution Scheme), and corresponding to an entry made there.(6.) The head of each household, on submitting the ration papers of the individual members to a local office and making a declaration (like the original sugar card application) as to his household, will, at the end of each quarter or other period, as may be arranged, obtain for such members cards for the purchase of bread, meat, fats, and sugar during the following quarter. Each card will consist of three portions, namely : (1) coupons to be detached and kept by the retailer on purchases ; (2) a retailer&apos;s &quot; docket,&quot; to be left with the retailer as a tie ; (3) a stub bearing the holder&apos;s name, which will remain at the end of the period of the card.(c.) The household declaration will be filed by the Food Control Committee (probably in street order) to form the local register of households, and the Committee will be responsible for checking the accuracy of the declaration in sample cases by comparison with school attendance records, rate books, &amp;c., or by domiciliary visits.(d.) The function of the Central Index will be to deal with types of fraud and duplication which would probably defeat any purely local checks, particularly in the following points : (i.) By making it difficult for fresh personalities to be created, (ii.) By checking the continuance of ration papers of men who have died or left the country or joined the forces.6. Tie to Retailer.The extent to which customers can be tied to particular retailers for their purchases will vary with the different foods and, to some extent, with the different districts, and can be left a good deal to the discretion of the local committees. It is very desirable to make the tie as complete as possible, both with a view to controlling distribution and with a view to the prevention of fraud.7. Public Meals.It will be necessary for coupons to be surrendered not only when rationed foods are bought from a shop, but also when they are consumed at a restaurant or other place of public eating.   It may be possible to simplify this requirement in practice by allowing a single coupon, or number of coupons, to cover all the different rationed foods bread, cereals, fats, sugar consumed at a meal, i.e., in effect, to have a &quot;meal&quot; coupon.8. Self-Suppliers.It will be necessary to control as completely as possible the &quot; self-suppliers,&quot; i,e., persons consuming their own produce, though clearly this control cannot be made absolutely watertight. In respect of cereals, it is probable that all grinding or milling lg?m ?USt be Proh.ibited except at a registered and controlled mill, which will then only hand back what it has ground in exchange for ration coupons. In respect of meat, it will, probably be necessary to provide that no cattle, sheep, or pigs can be killed without a licence, and to require surrender of the appropriate number of ration cards or coupons when a licence is issued to a supplier.[199] W C
9. Application to Ireland.The scheme is framed so as to apply to Ireland, if this is thought practicable. If not, it will be necessary to ration Ireland in bulk, i.e., to strike a general balance between imports and exports so as to leave Ireland with the proper quota of foodstuffs as a whole in proportion to population, and then to allow the distribution to be regulated in whatever manner can there be arranged.t10. Distribution.The object of rationing is not merely or even mainly to restrict consumption. Proper distribution of supplies according to need is an even more important purpose. The operation of the local rationing schemes under the Order of the 22nd December, by enabling the proper quota of supplies to each district to be accurately determined should put distribution on a broadly satisfactory basis by the time national rationing is introduced. Thereafter, by reference to the coupons, it will be possible to adjust every retailers supplies accurately and continuously to his actual ration sales.11. Functions of Food Control Committees.The system is national in so far as it prescribes for all districts the same scale of graded rations and a uniform set of ration documents (papers and cards) which will be available in all parts of the country. It is also national in using the central index of the whole population, which has been compiled for the purpose of the sugar distribution scheme. On the other hand, the scheme is local in so far as the Food Control Committee will be responsible for all the local work involving the exercise of discretion, and in particular for the following :  - .(a.) Compilation and checking of the local household registers.(b.) Grading of workers in various ration classes (for supplements in respect of heavy work, &amp;c).(c.) Control of retailers and of supplies and distribution generally within their areas.(d.) Replacement of lost cards, grant of emergency rations, and complaints and enquiries generally.(e.) Adjustment of scheme to local conditions in respect of retailers and other matters.Apart from this discretionary work there will be a considerable volume of routine work in the issue of ration cards, which must be done locally, and which may require the establishment of a large number of local offices in addition to the existing offices of the Food Committees. It is a question for further consideration whether the Food Committees should be made responsible for setting up any such offices or whether they should be set up directly by the Ministry of Food.Ministry of Food,January 24, 1918.

MINISTRY OF FOOD.REPORT BY DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON RATIONING AND DISTRIBUTION AS TO SCALE OF RATIONS.Wo have considered in the first place the articles to be rationed and the scale of rations to be allotted to various classes of the population, under a national system of compulsory rationing, and submit the following report thereon :-1. The Table on page 6 sets out the proposed scale of rations graded by age, sex and occupation. This scale assumes the receipt of supplies not substantially below the present estimates. The possibility of a grave failure of supplies is dealt with in paragraphs 25, 26 and 27.CLASSIFICATION OF POPULATION.2. The civilian population (estimated as numbering 43,000,000) has been divided into five main classes for rationing purposes.3. One of the classes is considerably larger than all the rest put together and may be regarded as the class drawing the &quot; normal ration.&quot; It comprises nearly all the women (15,500,000), all the men not engaged on physical work (3,000,000), and 8,000,000 boys and girls of ages six and upwards a total of 26,500,000.4. Below the normal class comes the class of children under six, numbering 6,000,000, and receiving a lower ration.5. Above the normal class are three classes entitled to higher rations on the ground of physical labour or adolescence. The first of these, numbering 3,500,000, consists of men on the heaviest work : it includes substantially all men engaged in mining, agriculture, heavy munition work, dock labour and similar occupations. The second class, numbering 5,000,000, comprises the remaining men doing manual labour, and women and boys on heavy work. The third class, numbering 2,000,000, comprises all other boys 13 and under 18, irrespective of occupation, and girls on heavy work.FOOD REQUIREMENTS OF VARIOUS CLASSES.6. The total amount of food assumed to be required on an average by each class is given in terms of Calories per day in Column 3 of the Table. The estimates of Calories, originally prepared by us for the five classes were: 3,750, 3,250, 2,750, 2,450 and 1,600 per day respectively. These estimates were submitted to the Food (War) Committee of the Royal Society, and the resolutions passed thereon by the Food (War) Committee are given in Enclosure 3 to this Report. Certain amendments have been made in our original proposals with a view to giving effect to these resolutions. These amendments are noted below.7. For class &quot; C&quot; (boys 13 and under 18 and girls on heavy work), we- have adopted the higher of the two figures mentioned in the Report of the Food (War) Committee, namely 3,000 Calories per day. This figure appears to be confirmed by such information as has been obtained up to the present from a number of schools.In the case of girls from 13 to 18 there is evidence to show that the Calories required are also appreciably above those specified for class &quot; B,&quot; namely, 2,450 per. day. This gure of 2,450, however, is only an average for the class, which includes large numbers oi small children who would not require as much as the average. As a general rule, tneretore the older girls should be able to obtain their proper share out of the total for tne tamily, and difficulty should only arise in the case of girls at school. It may be found necessary m practice to make special provision for girls&apos; schools in certain cases.A2
f8. In the case of class &quot; E &quot; (Men on heavy work) it was pointed out by the Food (War) Committee that this class covers several types of workers who are by no means uniform in their requirements. In particular, agricultural workers would not normally, before the war, take more than 3,500 Calories, while many munition workers would take 3,900 or more. We have accordingly sub-divided the class in estimating total Calorie requirements into two sections, namely, &quot; industrial,&quot; put at 3,900 Calories per day, and &quot; agricultural,&quot; put at 3,500 Calories per day. The resulting average for the whole Class is not far short of the original figure of 3,750. It is proposed that the actual ration should be the same for both sections. The agricultural workers should then find no difficulty in obtaining, without special assistance, the Calories required to be obtained by them from foods outside the ration, this being somewhat less than a quarter of their total requirements. As to the other section, it is suggested that, in respect at least of the heaviest workers of all, special steps will need to be taken to secure adequate nutriment, either by guaranteeing supplies of unrationed food or by special supple-mentary provision of rationed food through canteens or otherwise. This is a flexible method of providing for the needs of the heaviest workers without giving excessive rations to those with smaller requirements.9. The Calorie requirements stated in Column 3 are the basis of our proposals. These requirements have to be met partly by rationed foods and partly by unrationed foods. The sufficiency of the scale depends, therefore, both on the rationed foods being available to the extent of the rations allowed (so as to yield the Calories shown in Column 8 of the Table) and on the unrationed foods being available to make up the balance (as shown in Column 9), which is not provided by the rationed foods. This question is dealt with in pars. 25-29 below and more fully in Enclosure 1.10. It is proposed that the rationing system should in the first instance apply to bread ^(including flour), all cereals, meat (including bacon), fats (butter, margarine and lard), and sugar. The scale of rations proposed yields in each class roughly 75 per cent, of the total nutriment required, leaving the remaining 25 per cent, to be provided by unrationed foods of which the most important are potatoes and other vegetables, fruit, milk, fish, cheese, pulses, and jam and other preserves. In respect of milk, a special priority scheme is being proposed.SCALE OF RATIONS.11. The meaning of the scale will be best explained by taking one of the classes as :an illustration. Thus a man in the highest class (say an agricultural labourer or a coal miner) will be allowed to buy in a week 9 lb. of bread (or flour or any other cereal at the rate of f lb. for every lb. of bread), 3 lb. of meat (or, if he prefers it, a further lb. of bread -or f lb. of cereals, in place of each lb. of meat), f lb. of butter, margarine or lard, and -I lb. of sugar.* .....12. The bread and cereal ration will include all cakes, biscuits and similar articles containing flour, 1 lb. of any such article (or possibly less in the case of biscuits) being taken as equivalent to the same weight of bread. It will include also all cereals (rice, tapioca, oatmeal, maize meal, sago, arrowroot, &amp;c), but probably not beans, peas and lentils.13. The meat ration is that for uncooked butchers&apos; meat with the average amount of bone (usually reckoned as 20 per cent, of the meat and bone together, as purchased). It will be necessary to adjust the ration in relation to boneless meat and preserved and cooked meat, on the one hand, and joints with an excessive amount of bone on the other hand. It will also be necessary to adjust the ration in the case of bacon, e.g., by making f lb. of bacon count as 1 lb. for ration purposes. The best method of making these adjust-ments is a matter for further consideration. Whatever method is adopted, it would not -affect the general principle of the scale, which merely lays down the amounts that any method should on an average aim at providing.14. In considering the scale of rations proposed regard must be had to the fact that the rations, though allotted individually, will in fact be pooled in each family or other household. This makes it possible to divide the whole population into a few main classes. &quot;Deficiency of the ration for one member of a family can be made good by excess for another.
15. Deficiencies can also be adjusted by varying the proportion of unrationed foods consumed. Undoubtedly those will be in the best position to obtain rationed foods who -are either themselves producers of potatoes or other vegetables or are relatively prosperous. Having regard to the latter point, it seems justifiable and necessary to frame the ration -scale, if possible, in such a way as to favour those who are poorest, i.e., to enable them to get a larger proportion of their total nutriment from rationed foods, and so be less dependent on other foods.16. This has been done in so far as on the whole the younger children have been rationed liberally, partly by putting all children of six and upwards into the normal class, . and partly by not making the full deduction from the rationed foods for the milk that will be obtainable by the younger children under the priority scheme (pars. 17-18 below). Families with young children are, as a rule, at their least prosperous period. They will, under our proposals, be able to cover a relatively large proportion of their total requirements by the rationed foods, and should not suffer through their smaller command of other foods.RATIONS AND MILK PRIORITY SCHEME.17. The rations to be allowed to young children are of course materially affected by the scheme for giving to such children a prior claim to milk, which, next to potatoes, is the most important of the unrationed foods. We understand that under this scheme all children up to 18 months will receive priority for 1^ pints of milk a day, that older children up to and including five will receive priority for 1 pint a day, and that steps will be taken to enable necessitous children under school age to receive milk free or at a reduced price from the Sanitary Authorities. The ration for children under six has been adjusted accordingly, though&apos; it is still such as to put those families which make use of the milk priority scheme into a relatively favourable position.18. This is apparent from the fact that to obtain the total food requirement of 1,600 Calories per day, a child will need to get only 489 Calories from unrationed food, such as potatoes, milk, jam, fish, &amp;c. One pint of milk represents 400 Calories, and 1\ pints represents 600 Calories, that is to say, the milk alone nearly or more than makes up the total required. A family witli young children which avails itself of the milk scheme will be able, if necessary, to use part of the children&apos;s ration of bread, meat or fat for the older : members.  For the reasons stated above, we regard this as desirable and necessary.UNITS OF FOOD.19. The scale has been framed on a basis of units of food as follows : Calories.Bread, I lb. (or f lb. flour)      ......yielding 1.2001,245 1,430* 900 900Cereals,   lb.Meat, 1 lo. (including average bone)Fats, \ lb. Sugar, \ lb.* This value is based upon the following data : The estimated meat supply for 1918 (Minimum Indent), including poultry game andrabto,:is placed : at 2,041,500 British tons, equivalent to 2,074,200 metric tons. The emulated total energy valaeof^he supply - equals 6,517,280 million Calories.    This gives a Calorie value per kdo of 3,140 Calories, or per lb. of 1,MUThe percentage composition taken for the different varieties of meat is as follows :-Protein. Fat. Energy valueper kilo.&quot;S-jj ......  - &apos;     -  -   jj-jj      fsi      g5rASfi&amp;z ::. ::: ::: ::: :::  S3 jg(Foreign)        ............... 14-0 22.5 2,66oPork (Home and Foreign)    ............ 10-0 40-0Bacon (  ,,        ,,              ........... 10.0 45.0 4,595Hams      .      .       ...      ............ 15.0 30.0
The units of bread, cereals and meat are of approximately equal Calorie value, so that in the case of necessity any one unit can, within certain limits, be exchanged for another without serious disadvantage. As is pointed out below, this is of great importance, both from the administrative point of view and with a view to allowing for variation in the customs and the purchasing power of different classes of the community. The steps from one class to another are in the case of each food steps by one or more complete units.INTERCHANGEABILITY OF RATIONS.20. In the case of bread, flour and cereals, complete interchangeability is proposed; that is to say, it will be optional in every case to buy either 1 lb. of bread or f lb. of flour or f lb. of any cereal product (rice, oatmeal, tapioca, &amp;c).21. In the case of meat, a certain amount of interchangeability with bread is in-dispensable. The agricultural labourers and the munition workers in the first class are intended to obtain the same food value from rationed foods, but they can hardly get it in the same proportion from bread and meat. Two lb. of meat per week is more than many of the former can afford ; 3 lb. is less than very many of the latter are now eating. Under the scale any person in the highest class may take from 0 to 3 lb. of meat and correspondingly from 12 to 9 lb. of bread. So, too, the normal ration covers both the well-paid brain worker (who has hitherto taken much more than 2 lb. of meat) and the woman clerk or working-class child of six or seven (who will get, as a rule, less than H lb.). Incidentally this interchange meets completely the case of the vegetarian.22. Interchangeability is important also from the point of view of guaranteeing, supplies.   If, for instance, in any district or at any time it proved impossible to provide anything like the full ration of fats, the position could be eased by allowing for a temporary interchange with flour, say at the rate of J lb. of fat for \ lb. of flour.23. The actual consumption of bread, cereals and meat respectively will, of course, depend upon the manner in which the power of interchange is exercised by the various classes. It is clear that numbers of persons, having regard to their previous habits and to prices, will not be able and willing to buy the full amount of meat that is possible under the scale. The actual consumption of meat in each class has been estimated accordingly in the manner explained in Enclosure 1, after consideration of the persons included therein, and is shown by the bracketed figures in Column 5. The bracketed figures in Column 4 then give the expected consumption of bread and cereals, assuming that everything not drawn as meat is drawn under those headings.24. In one case the ration proposed without necessarily affecting the total food consumed will involve a material change in the habits of the class in question. This is. the class of professional and business men included in class B, with a normal ration limiting them to 2 lb. of meat per week. In view of the prospective shortage of meat we have-not felt it possible to allow a higher meat ration than this. We think, however, that any improvement in the meat position should be utilised in the first instance to give a larger meat ration to this class (with a corresponding reduction of the bread ration).PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIES OF RATIONED FOODS.25. The relation between the ration scale proposed and the available supplies of the various articles is discussed in Enclosure 1. The general result is to show a small margin on meats and fats and a substantial margin on cereals. On cereals, meats and fats together there is a margin practically equivalent to 2,000,000 tons in the year, assuming that the full food programme of the Ministry of Food is realised. We understand, however, from information laid before us that there is very little chance of the programme being realised in full, and that the degree of failure may possibly far exceed the margin. provided.
26. We propose accordingly to consider further where reductions could be made in the scale with the least harmful results, if such reductions became inevitable. For this purpose we have asked to be furnished with an estimate of what may be regarded as the minimum of supplies available in the most unfavourable circumstances.27. In this connection we have had prepared and submit in Enclosure 2 a comparison between our scale and a typical German scale.   It will be seen that our scale is. about 45 per cent, in excess of the German one. There is, therefore, ground for believing that the life and even the work of the country could be carried on for a time, even if a reduction of our scale became necessary.   But there would be the gravest risk to health:and output in permitting reduction to a level approaching the German scale, and an even greater danger of popular revolt. Apart from physiological considerations and apart also from differences in the characters of the two peoples, it would appear impossible for any Government in this country to enforce a scale of rations on the level of the German scale. The German people have accepted their scale because it was forced on them by enemy action and a nearly complete cessation of overseas trade.  Here, so long as any-substantial overseas trade remained, starvation would appear to be the fault of the&apos; Government in not maintaining food supplies.PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIES OF UNRATIONED FOODS.28. Columns of the Table gives the number of Calories per day yielded by the rations 1 in each class and Column 9 gives the number of Calories required from unrationed foods in order to make up the total assumed to be necessary for the class. On the basis of these figures the total Calories required to be provided from unrationed foods for the whole population during a year is lO-J billions. The number estimated to be available is 12^ billions. There is, therefore, a fair margin. This is required to cover both failure of supplies and inequality of distribution.   A detailed calculation is given in Enclosure 1.29. Even supposing total supplies of unrationed foods to be more than sufficient, it is, of course, impossible to guarantee that each class and each individual will be able to get the proper quota. All that can be said is that there is no apparent reason to anticipate difficulty for any class in this respect. The most important of the unrationed foods  potatoes is widely available for all classes and is largely consumed by the poor. The -next most.important milk will be the subject of a special priority scheme securing it for those who most need it. The classes and families which are likely to have least command of money, and so of unrationed foods, have been deliberately favoured in the construction of the ration scale, and should not in fact need the full quota of Calories shown in Column 9.Scale of Rations omitting Cereals.30. We have put forward the scale of rations described above in accordance with what we understand to be the meaning of our terms of reference, under which we were asked to prepare a scale of rations for &quot; essential foods.&quot; Such a scale must clearly cover bread and cereals generally. We understand, however, that a suggestion is under consideration for excluding cereals from the rationing system, at any rate in the first instance, and for applying rationing only to meat, fats and sugar. It does not appear to us to be within our terms of reference to express any views upon this suggestion, and we have not considered -in detail the rations which it would be suitable to prescribe under such a system. It is clear, nowever, that the omission of cereals would vitally alter the problem before us. There would be no question of estimating the total food requirements of different classes, and the rations to be prescribed would be determined almost solely by the supplies available, with one or two simple adjustments as between different classes. It would not be possible ::(as is done in our scale) to allow in the ration for interchange of food to suit the needs and customs of the different classes.
r31. Assuming, however, that some rough and ready scale of rations limited to sugar, meat and fats is required, the following appears to us to be as satisfactory a proposal as-can be put forward : Sugar. Half lb. to all classes.Meat. A normal ration of 2 lb., with a half ration for children under six, and a 50 per cent, supplement for the heaviest workers (if this can be arranged without excessive administrative difficulty).If supplies to this extent are not available, the normal ration can be reduced to 1 \ lb. or less and the other rations in proportion.Fats. A normal ration of \ lb. throughout, with a 50 per cent, supplement to -the heaviest workers (if this can be arranged without excessive administrative-difficulty).If supplies to this extent are not available, the ration must be reduced accordingly for all classes.CONCLUSION.32. We should add, in conclusion, that we have experienced considerable difficulty in-arriving at any definite estimate of the supplies likely to be available either of meat or of fats. There seems no prospect at all of the original estimates (described in Enclosure 1 as the &quot; full tonnage programme &quot; supplies) being attained, and we have, in fact, reduced our rations of meat and fats accordingly below those originally proposed. It is not certain that even these lower figures will be realised, but assuming that adequate provision is made for allowing the use of cereals, to compensate for a deficiency of these other articles, we think that our scale may stand.33. In bringing to a conclusion the present stage of our work, we desire to place on. record our appreciation of the very valuable services rendered by Mr. H. McKinnon Wood as Secretary to the Committee for the purpose of this enquiry.W. H. BEVERIDGE, Chairman.. ROBERT HUTCHISON.D. NOEL PATON. M. S. REEVES.E. I. SPRIGGS. S. G. TALLENTS.W. HENRY THOMPSON.

Rationed Foods. The following table compares summarily the full consumption under the ration scale and the estimated supplies, assuming that the full programme of food imports is realised and using such estimates of the home supplies as were available in December 1917.	Bread and Cereals (in Terms of Bread).	Meat.	Fats.	Sugar.Ration consumption  Lb. per head per week	6.39	1.73	0.55	0.50Supplies on the full programme  Lb. per head per week	7.72	2.03	0.68	0.50Meat and Bread. In estimating the meat and bread consumption an allowance has been made (a) For interchange.(b) For the rationing of bacon at f lb. for every 1 lb. of the ration.For instance, in determining the average consumption of meat by Class E, it has been assumed that the agricultural class will take an average of 10 lb. of bread and 2 lb. of meat or rather less, while the industrial class will take 9 lb. of bread and the full 3 lb. of meat. The average for the whole class, without allowing for bacon, thus works out at practically 9J lb. of bread, and 2h lb. of meat. The latter figure for the purposes of comparison with the available supplies has been then reduced, having regard to the fact that some of the meat will be taken as bacon. The average reduction to be made on this ground is 5 per cent., so the actual net meat consumption for purpose of comparison with the estimated supplies has been written down in Class E to 2.37.Similar calculations have been made for the other classes.On this basis, the full net consumption of bread and meat by each class has been estimated as follows : Class.	Bread and Cereals.	Meat.	E...             ... D ... C ...     ...     ... B........ A.........	9.50 8.50 7.75 6.25 3.00	(a) 2.50 2.50 2.25 1.75 1.00	(&amp;) 2.37 2.37 2.14 1.66 .95	6.39	1.82	1.73(a) Bacon taken at its actual weight. (&amp;) f lb. bacon reckoned as 1 lb.The ration consumption shown in the table is a maximum consumption, based on the assumption that every individual will draw every week his full allowance. Since this will not happen and since none can draw more than the maximum, there is here a substantial margin of safety. The actual consumption, particularly where no interchange is permitted&quot;(as in fats), will almost certainly be below that shown in the table.The bread (including cereal) supplies have been calculated as follows: Cereal imports as indent       ...      ...............Less Margin for illegal use as animal food    ............Army        ...      ...     ......      ...      ...      ...      ...ManufacturesImported as meals or riceTons.500,000 400,000 20,000Say two thirds wheat One third dUuentsTons. 7,500,000920,0006,580,000 500,000-6,080,0004,080,000 2,000,000BENCLOSURE I-THE RATION SCALE, THE AVAILABLE SUPPLIESAND PREVIOUS CONSUMPTION.

In estimating home supplies allowance has been made for reduction of weight of carcase. Imported supplies have been taken at the indent figures, deducting, of course, army consumption.Fats. Imported supplies have been taken at the indent figures for butter, margarine and lard.Sugar. The sugar supply for civilians has been put at the ration allowance, but will, of course, more than cover the ration for sugar as such, a considerable quantity entering into unrationed manufactured foods (jam, syrup, confectionery, condensed milk, jelly powders, &amp;c).On the general.question of probable deficiency of supplies cf. the text of the Report, p. 6.Margin on supplies over ration requirements. It will be seen that the available supplies on the full tonnage programme exceed the requirements by 1.33 lb. of bread, 0.30 lb. of meat and 0.13 lb. of fats.1.33 lb. of bread may be taken as equivalent to 1.00 lb. of flour, or taking the average effective pro-portion of flour obtained from grain at 67 per cent, to 1.50 lb. of imported grain.The total excess of imports over net requirements would therefore be in round numbers some 1,500,000 tons of grain, 300,000 tons of meat and 130,000 tons of fats, total nearly 2,000,000 tons.This is the gross excess; a working margin must be allowed. If the imports were reduced by 1,333,000 tons in a complete year, i.e., by 1,000,000 tons in 1918, during which rationing is assumed to be in force for nine months only, this would leave a margin of some 600,000 tons on cereals, meats and fats alone. The margin would amount to over 6 per cent, and would probably just suffice.Calories from rationed and unrationed foods.-The following table compares the Calories required and available from rationed and unrationed foods respectively, again assuming that the full programme of food imports is realised: 	Billion Calories.			Rationed Foods.	Unrationed Foods.	All Food.Bequired ...      ......	29.58	10.51	40.09Available..................	35.79	12.35	48.14Margin above requirements     .........	21 per cent.	18 per cent.	20 per cent.The Calories available from rationed foods have been calculated on the quantities assumed in the preceding statement respecting quantities required and available, together with the ration of sugar. In calculating the Calories available from unrationed foods, the sugar in manufactured articles has been brought into account, and it has been assumed that none of the miscellaneous items omitted from the indent (canned fish, fresh a,nd dried fruit, eggs, vegetables, &amp;c.) will be imported. The probability that a considerable quantity of such articles (value, say 0.5 billion Calories) will in fact come in may be set off against the possibility that sugar -will not be obtainable for manufactures to the extent desired.The rations compared with former consumption. The estimated consumption under the proposed scale of Tations compares as follows with the pre-war consumption of 1909-13 and the consumption of 1916, as estimated in the Reports of the Food (War) Committee of the Royal Society. Later estimates suggest that the Royal Society figure for meat consumption in 1916 might be lowered by 2 or 3 per cent., but the difference is hardly material.Lb. per head per week.

The figures are then as follows : 
The German rations include, in addition to bread, meat, fats and sugar, relatively large quantities of potatoes. These have been added accordingly to the British ration, on the assumption that they will be available in the following proportions : Heavy workers       ..................... 7 lb.Ordinary workers    .........      ............ 6 ,,Adolescents   ..................... -    ... 5 ,,Normal ration        ..................... 4 ,,Children under 9     ..................... 3 ,,This yields an average of slightly under 4  lb. per head, as compared with an estimate of 5 lb. per head actually available.   In view of the relatively large Irish consumption this margin is reasonable.The actual German ration taken for comparison is that in force in Hamburg in October-November, 1917.* It follows closely the general limits laid down in the Imperial Ration Scale, and is certainly not below the average. Small distributions of &quot; other cereals &quot; outside the bread and flour ration are made in Germany ; the figures taken for bread have, therefore, been increased by the estimated amounts of such distributions. The Calorie values assumed for the comparison are : Bread (including cereals expressed as bread), 1,200 per lb.; meat, 1,430 ; fats, 3,600 ; sugar, 1,800 ; potatoes, 400. The figures given for the United Kingdom are the actual ration, not the assumed consumption which allows for the transfer from meat to bread. No essential difference would be made by taking the consumption figures instead of the ration.1.

It has been assumed that the same fat supplement was given to Heavy Workers as was then allowed in Essen and some other places, and that Hamburg had continued the practice of issuing two supplementary bread tickets (800 grammes each) to the heaviest workers, as was done in April 1917. There is reason to doubt the former assumption, and the -statement of Hamburg Heavy Workers&apos; rations may therefore be too favourable.enclosure 2.-comparison of german and britishrations.

The figure of 2,081 for the corresponding United Kingdom ration is the weighted average for the-adolescents and the normal class and this includes all men, women and children from 6 years of age upwards not receiving a higher ration on account of the character of their work.The general result is to show that for the foregoing foods (covering over 80 per cent, of the total nutrition in this country) the British scale is some 45 per cent, better than the German.As from January 1st, 1918, the Imperial German Government has reduced the iirban fat ration (butter and margarine) to 2\ oz. (70 grammes) per head of population per week, out of which quantum all supplements to Heavy Workers and invalids must be provided. The German press has announced that a reduction of the ordinary fat ration to 2.2-2.3. oz. must be the consequence; but the fat ration in Hamburg and in Greater Berlin for the week January 5th to 11th, 1918, was 2.47 oz., so that may, perhaps, be inferred that no supplements are to be given in those areas. A comparison with German rations in the new year would, therefore, be even more favourable to the proposed British scale than the figures -given above.Precise statistics as to the other foods available in Germany cannot be given, but it seems certain that ^they cannot be nearly as abundant as in this country.
ENCLOSURE 3.-REPORT BY THE FOOD (WAR) COMMITTEE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY ON THE SCHEME OF COMPULSORY RATIONING SUBMITTED BY THE RATIONING COMMITTEE OF THE MINISTRY OF FOOD.17th December, 1917.The Committee have considered further the proposed compulsory rations as arranged at the meeting of the Rationing Committee held on 6th December, 1917, and beg leave to report as follows : CLASS I. HEAVY WORKERS.It was Resolved that the minimum average requirement of this class may be put at 3,750 Calories as purchased. Any reduction below this level would inevitably lessen the output of work and cause loss of body weight and discontent.Comments.In a series of studies made upon the dietaries of convicts in Scotland, Dr. Dunlop observed the effects of-diets ranging from 3,500 to 3,900 Calories upon men doing a moderate day&apos;s work. At 3,900 body weight was maintained and complaints referred entirely to quality and not to quantity, thus suggesting that prisoners were receiving more food than they required. Waste was considerable. At 3,500 Calories 82 per cent, of the men lost weight. Complaints no longer referred to quality but to want of food, to faintness at work, and to sleeplessness at night. The complaints were &quot; pitiable and undoubtedly genuine.&quot; Waste was completely abolished. At 3,700 Calories 24 per cent, lost weight, waste was abolished, and the only complaints received were from heavy men, for whom the diet had to be increased further. - *It must be borne in mind that in this case there was not only the economy in food which results from collective feeding, but also that the loss in distribution was minimal.The Committee would draw attention to the fact that, if a fiat rate is adopted for occupations which come under the heading of &quot; heavy work,&quot; some workers will receive too little and some too much. This may be partially met by allowing supplementary rations to certain classes of heavy workers, especially those who are working overtime, are exposed to cold, or are called upon to work at high pressure. In this connexion the following further consideration needs to be borne in mind : Amongst the heavy workers are included agricultural labourers. Most dietary studies would fix their consumption before the war at below 3,500 Calories. A ration of 3,750 Calories would be for many an increase. It might be urged, therefore, that, taking heavy workers as a whole, the lower demand of the agricultural labourers would balance the higher demand of the heaviest workers in industry. Too much reliance must not be placed on this. The dietetic habits of the agricultural labourers -have been changed by the war. The purchasing power of the families has increased and they are eating better food and probably more of it.CLASS II.It was Resolved that the physiological needs of this class would be met by an average diet of 3,250 -Calories.CLASS III.After much discussion it was Resolved that, though a diet of 2,750 Calories might be sufficient to maintain the industrial population of boys at its pre-war level, it is certain that a considerable number would not attain the full normal development.It was also Resolved that in the opinion of the Committee 3,000 Calories should be allotted to this class .Comments.In coming to this conclusion the Committee have been influenced by the following considerations: 1. The period between 13 and 18 is a period of rapid growth.   In the first three years this is accompaniedt by constant muscular activity in the healthy boy, and in the last three years by important develop-mental changes.
2. Experiments made by Sonden and Tigerstedt on a large number of adolescents have shown that the food requirements of boys between 13 and 18 are exceptionally large in proportion to their size. In the thirteenth year the energy output rises markedly, and maintains the high level until the nineteenth year. During these years the output of carbonic acid is 42 to 45 grammes per person per hour, as against 38 grammes for men between 20 and 30. The contrast is still more marked if we take into apcount the fact that the boys weighed considerably less than the men. In Calories the results may be expressed as follows: Average Age. Average Weight. Calories per day.13.8 44.5 kilos . 3,20815.5 51.4 ,,     . 3,00925 67.5  ,, 2,760The subjects were sitting in a respiration chamber when the measurements were made. 3. These measurements represent the energy required in the food digested.   The food purchased mustyield considerably more.   Not less than 10 per cent, additional must be allowed for this. 4. The maintenance of the working capacity of the nation depends upon the proper development of theseadolescents, and it is from this class that the Army is recruited. 5. The statistics of the dietaries of schools produced by Professor W. H. Thompson show a consumptionof about 3,000 Calories at the present time i.e., when voluntary limitation of diet is being urged. &apos; 6. The figures given by Dr. Pembrey, Lecturer in Physiology at Guy&apos;s Hospital, in his article &quot; Diet andFeeding of School Children,&quot; &quot; School Hygiene,&quot; August, 1915, and in the Journal of the RoyalSanitary Institute, 38, 1917, p. 60, show that for boys over 13, 3,000 Calories is a low allowance. 7. The greater energy required for the young is recognised in the Army, where to &apos;-&apos; boys &quot; 16 oz. ofbread are allowed in the place of 14 oz. allowed for men.8. Studies made in Glasgow of the family dietaries of the labouring classes show that the average energy in the food purchased amounts to about 3,300 Calories per man per day. Boys over 15 certainly eat as much as a man, so that even allowing a lower requirement for those from 13 to 15, 3.000 Calories for the group are barely sufficient.CLASSES IV and V.It was Resolved that the rations allotted, namely 2,450 and 1,600 Calories are sufficient on a war basis.As a general rider to the above findings the Committee would point out that the rations allotted represent the average minimal physiological needs of the several classes ; not the physiological optima.W.B.H.
