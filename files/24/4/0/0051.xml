Row, R.N., Assistant Secretary.Mr. Churchill circulated a tank programme for the period between the 1st February, 1918, and the 31st March, 1919* and stated that by April 1919 the pro-duction, as shown under that month, could be continued indefinitely. He added that it was a programme which indicated development towards the beginning of July next, but extending more rapidly in the later months of 1918 and the earlier months of 1919. He stated that the programme had been prepared in relation to the steel and steel-plates required by the Admiralty, as set out in their Paper of the 8th January last, which covered, as far as plates were concerned, the Admiralty require-ments both as regards merchant shipbuilding and warship construction.   Mr.* Owing- to the highly secret nature of this document it has not been included in the Minutes, butjs kept for record in the offices of the War Cabinet.
Churchill mentioned, however, that the Admiralty were at present not using the plates that had been allotted to them. At the present moment they had a surplus stock of approximately 80,000 tons of plates. Mr. Churchill asked that the Admiralty might hand back for the use of tanks 1,500 tons a week out of this surplus of four weeks&apos; stock, and mentioned that such a release would only mean a reduction of one week&apos;s reserve in 14 or 15 weeks&apos; time.Sir Eric Geddes was of opinion that the figures as stated by Mr. Churchill were based on a fallacy, and it was not correct to say that the piates in hand were a reserve, though he admitted the Admiralty had at present a four weeks&apos; floating working stock.   He further admitted that during the last six weeks the available supply of plates had exceeded the amount which had been put into the ships, but, he added, that at the present moment the use of plates in shipbuilding was increasing. Sir Eric Geddes drew attention to the fact that he had asked, in all, for 2,350,000 tons of  steel for all purposes; i.e.y for mercantile and warship building and armaments.  On this figure of demand, the Committee on the Restriction of Imports had decided that a cut should be made, in consequence of which the Admiralty had succeeded in reducing their requirements to 2,100,000 tons, which the Ministry of Munitions had asked might be reduced to 2,000,000 tons.   The &quot;War Cabinet, how-ever, had said that the Admiralty should carry on their existing programme without alteration, and that if, later, they experienced difficulty in obtaining the necessary material, they should bring the matter to the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 347, Minute 11).   Sir Eric Geddes interpreted the figures in connection with the tank programme as follows: The original tank programme required in 1918,. approxi-mately 60,000 tons of steel.  To this there was recently added for an extended tank programme 34,000 tons of steel.   In addition to this there was a steel demand in the Anglo-American Tank agreement under which we provided the steel for the plates, and we were to be recouped for the same from America in kind.  This recoup-ment, however, was chimerical, as the Americans had no tonnage surplus, but a great deficiency of tonnage for their own-needs, and it was quite certain that any steel we put into the American tanks would not be refunded to us in advance on the ton for ton basis of the agreement.  The total of these three requirements of steel for tanks was 127,000 tons; but by the programme now put forward this latter total had been increased to 193,000 tons, which meant that, whereas the supply of steel at&quot; present allotted to tanks by the Steel Allocation Committee was at the rate of 46,000 tons per annum, another 147,000 tons was now asked for.   Sir Eric Geddes said, however, that the Admiralty had no objection to raise against the extended tank programme, provided that the Cabinet authority stood for them to receive the 2,100,000 tons* of steel required for the Admiralty programme as a first provision. He urged that ship-building must be the first consideration, and he believed that it would be possible to make up the arrears in mercantile shipbuilding which would necessitate any arrears of steel being made u&quot;p.The Prime Minister said that if in any months a conflict arose out of the demands for material for shipbuilding or for tanks, shipbuilding must come first, and tanks, or something else, must suffer, but certainly not ships.Lord Derby asked whether it was intended that steel for British tanks should come before steel required for what was termed the Anglo-American programme.Mr. Churchill admitted that such would be the case as regards the original tank programme. He mentioned that, owing to the nature of the present operations on the Western front, 10,000 tons of shell steel was being saved weekly in France, and that, in addition, during the month of January shipping had been provided for 50,000 tons more steel than had been anticipated; he therefore hoped that there would be no difficulty in meeting the 2,100,000 tons, asked for by the Admiralty in lieu of the 2,000,000 that had previously been recommended by the Ministry of Munitions. Mr. Churchill urged, however, that he might, during the next few weeks, be allowed: to draw upon the Admiralty reserve of steel plates, in order to expedite his tank programme as much as possible.Colonel Stern mentioned that under the terms of the Anglo-American agreement the Americans had priority after the existing tank programme, and before any extended tank programme.Lord Derby strongly objected to such an interpretation.* This 2,100.000 tons for Admiralty requirements includes ships of all kinds, armament, mines, paravanes,. ; otters, a id extensions of shipyards and works, the only requirements not included are tubes and wire.
Colonel Stern continued to the effect that he had received information that the? plates were ready in the United States of America, and the Inter-Allied Council were being asked to provide shipping.Mr. Churchill added that the United States programme begins from July or August onwards, that the bulk of his new programme did not operate until next year, and that if the Americans would provide the plates it would pay us to carry plates, as no goods were more valuable or more economical from a shipping point of view.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he had not had time to go thoroughly into the tank question, but it was certain that we had not sufficient man-power to break down the enemy&apos;s defence by infantry alone, and that the tanks were a promising means to enable us to do so, but that, in taking any survey of the situa-tion, the intermediate stage when machine-guns and aeroplanes would be required must be reviewed, and that the first thing was to make certain that our present line was secure. He understood that 100,000 &quot; A &quot; men would be wanted by March 1919, to enable the tanks, as provided by the new programme, to be fully operative.General Capper stated that approximately twenty men were required for a tank and for service on the same, but some &quot;B&quot; men were included in the establish-ment.  85 to 90 per cent., however, must be &quot; A &quot; men.Certain figures relative to our requirements month by month for tanks were handed in by General Capper, but the Prime Minister considered that the reinforce-ments as set out therein were put at a very high figure.General Capper explained that he had allowed for 5 per cent, losses, and instanced that as regards the tanks employed at Arras in two days&apos; fighting our losses in the fighting crews had been 12 per cent., mostly wounded, and at Cambrai, after 10 days&apos; fighting, the losses amounted to 28 per cent. The average normal wastage was stated to be 3 per cent., but that included men who would ultimately return to the force.The Prime Minister pointed out that it was essential that the tank programme should not suffer because excessive numbers were demanded from the point of view of man-power.Lord Derby and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to go into the question as to the minimum man-power required to carry out the tank programmes as a whole.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave instances of the advantages and the saving which had accrued by the use of tanks. For instance, at Messines twelve divisions were employed on a front of 16,500 yards, and after the first 48 hours&apos; fight-ing our casualties amounted to 16,000, and the depth of our advance was 4,000 yards. At Cambrai we employed only seven divisions, supported by tanks, on a front of 13,000 yards. Our casualties, after two daws&apos; fighting, only amounted to 9,500 men, and we gained in depth no less than 9,000 yards, which meant approximately, with an equal force, half the number of casualties and double the gain in depth. More-over, we saved at Cambrai a matter of 80,000 tons of ammunition.Figures were given as to the number of tanks we now have, and this, taken in conjunction with the next few months, caused the Prime Minister to express the view that as regards the immediate future we were disappointingly short of tanks.General Elles stated that a tank was fit to go into the fighting line in from two to three weeks after delivery.Questioned- as to the French tanks, Mr. Churchill stated that they were a small type, and that the Minister of Armaments estimated the output at fifteen a day, but, from information he had received, that estimate would hardly be worked to.The question was raised as to whether, if we were unable to carry out the manning of the tanks to be provided under the extended programme, the French would be likely to take them over from us, and it wras considered that they would be only too glad to do so; it being also mentioned that the Americans would be very pleased to do the same.General Elles explained that the French adopt different measures, as regards the employment of their light tanks, from what we do, and that they propose to allot them to every battalion; they may, therefore, be considered in all respects part of the armament of the same. He considered that the small French tanks were very good as far as they went, but they had serious limitations, inasmuch as it was impossible
for them to travel over bad ground without assistance from infantry, although they were very mobile in other respects. He thought, however, that arrangements could be made for them to be worked in co-operation with our tanks in the event of a big tank attack being organised.  He considered, however, that we should not get sufficient tanks during 1918 to enable a decisive tank battle to take place.&apos; Colonel Stern stated that the Americans were building 4,000 light tanks of the French type, and that they were also making big tanks to the full capacity of the United States resources.Mr. Churchill stated that he would put forward, in due course, to the War Office a proposal for the exchange of a certain number of our heavy tanks for a certain number of the French&apos;light tanks, and mentioned that he thought the little tanks might be very useful in defence.General Elles stated that for tanks to be efficient it was imperative that they should be supported by infantry, and that a good deal remained to be done in the way of co-operation between the two arms to ensure success. He was confident the difficulties could be overcome.General Capper stated that there was a new supply carrier tank which was capable of carrying some thirty men inside it, and that some of the tanks already being made, if not used as fighters, were capable of carrying twenty infantry in addition to driving crews.Mr. Churchill mentioned that a scheme was under consideration which, if practicable, would enable the infantry more readily to support the tanks during an advance.Questioned as to whether he had any evidence as to the Germans being in possession of tanks, General Elles replied that, although he had no first-hand evidence as to size, he had received information that the Germans were in a position to put tanks into the line in the near future.Sir E. H. Tennyson D&apos;Eyncourt was of opinion that if one admitted that tanks were necessary, one was forced to the conclusion that their economy was very great in man-power as well as material, and far more so than appeared at first sight.Mr. Churchill informed the War Cabinet that his tank programme involved a very large armament programme, to the extent of 10,000 6-pr. guns, and 30,000 machine-guns, but he hoped to be able to achieve his armament programme without prejudice to any other requirement.Summary of Conclusions.(a.) The extended tank programme as put forward by the Minister of Munitions was approved subject to the proviso that if at any time it entailed a shortage of steel no reduction was to be made in the amount already approved for Admiralty purposes. (See also War Cabinet 347, Minute 11).(&amp;.) The question of a temporary loan to the Ministry of Munitions of steel plates from the floating working stock accumulated by the Admiralty for the pur-pose of accelerating the tank programme was left for arrangement between the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions.(c.) The Secretary of State for War and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should go into the question of the minimum man-power necessary for the tank pro-gramme as a whole and inform the Director of National Service as requisite.(d.) The armament programme for the tanks was approved.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., March 9, 1918.o
