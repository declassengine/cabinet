[TMs Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Govenaneifo]Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.SECRET.0-166.WAR  CABINET.FINANCIAL BLOCKADE.Interim Report No. 1 of a Committee appointed by the War Cabinet to Consider the Question of an Economic Offensive.(Previous Papers, Nos. G-156, 158, 159, 160, 161, and War Cabinet 247, Minute 8.)1. The Committee have considered the proposal for the establishment of a financial blockade as advocated in the attached memorandum by Sir A. Block (Appendix). The main outlines of that proposal are : (1) That no bank in any Allied country shall deal with any bank in a neutral country that transacts any business for enemy subjects or in enemy securities and credits ; (2) that banks in neutral countries should be invited to give notice by a certain date of their willingness to comply with these&quot; conditions.&quot;1. The Committee are of opinion that if the great majority of neutral banks could be compelled to accept these conditions it will become extremely difficult even if other agencies for the transfer of credits could eventually be established for Germany to transfer her credits from one neutral country to another, as she now does to help her exchange, or to set up new credits. Her credits in South America, for instance, would no longer be available to support her purchases of ore and foodstuffs in Scandinavia.3. The Committee understand that there are very few neutral banks which could afford to be cut off from dealings in London, Paris, and New York, and therefore consider that the proposal can be effectively carried out providing French and American support can be secured. They are informed that the French and Russian Govern-ments have already expressed themselves favourably with regard to some such proposal, hut that no reply has been received from the United States Government to repeated enquiries made of them on the subject.4. In view of the great importance of disorganising German trade and exchange m neutral countries, and of restricting Germany&apos;s imports from her neutral neighbours during the war, the Committee regard the carrying out of the proposed financial blockade as not only desirable but urgent, and trust that the War Cabinet will approve of this policy and authorise every possible step being taken to secure the prompt co-operation of the other Allies, and more particularly of the United States.(Signed) E. CARSON, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 31, 1917.11115   1]B
APPENDIX.Financial Blockade.The following memorandum, prepared in the main by Sir Adam Block, indicates the general lines of the proposed tightening of the financial blockade.(Initialled) R. C.October 22, 1917.THE Allies cannot afford to neglect any measures which&quot; will conduce to a speedy , conclusion of the war.Germany has devoted as much care to the development of her financial policy as to the proficiency of her army. The financial edifice of Germany has been built up with boldness, prudence, and foresight, not only for use in peace time, but for use in war ; and the crippling of her finance will be no less an instrument towards the coercion of Germany than the crippling of her military power or of her commerce.During the past two decades, Germany had succeeded in weaving a network of intimate banking relations in America. Asia, and Europe. Branches and agencies of great German banks have been established throughout the world, and many banking institutions in neutral countries have gradually, to a greater or lesser degree, fallen under German influence. The system has been so successfully engineered that it is not always easy to ascertain exactly to what extent certain banks, neutral in outward appearance, are in reality the agents and the accomplices for German financial and commercial penetration, even though there may be no German directors on the board and no evidence of German capital.The boldness of German financial policy has been remarkable. Its success is incontestable, and, as a consequence, an alliance has sprung up between German bankers and the bankers of every country of the world. That the weapon thus forged has contributed in a large measure to Germany&apos;s successful commercial development is incontestable, and the instrument has proved as useful for war purposes as in peace, as doubtless was intended and foreseen. Germany&apos;s financial arrangements in neutral countries have largely assisted Germany to find the means of sustaining her waning credit, and still contribute to the easing of the strain on her finances.Since the commencement of hostilities, Germany has spared no effort to retain the faculty of disposing freely of her financial resources existing outside the Empire, and of drawing freely on funds which have either accumulated abroad in German banks and institutions before or during the war, or wmich have been created during the war by the sale of securities or by loans and advances from neutrals. Her close relationship with neutral banks has facilitated her task. With the help of neutral banks, in many cases more than sympathetic, the funds at Germany&apos;s disposal have been shifted at her pleasure from one neutral country to another as the require-ments. of exchange, of trade, and of political propaganda necessitated. As the funds j abroad decreased, and the difficulties of shifting these funds increased by reason of the blockade measures adopted by the Allies; the German exchange, suffering already from adverse balance of trade, has become more and more affected, and in order, amongst other things, to maintain this exchange, even at the low rate to which it had fallen, Germany had been obliged to export gold, and to seek further loans at ruinous prices in neutral countries. The funds at the disposal of Germany in North and South America have been largely utilised for replenishing her credits in countries in Europe contiguous to Germany, from which countries Germany, in spite of the blockade by sea, could still draw supplies. The two following examples will suffice to show the character of the assistance afforded by neutral banks.1. A neutral bank in South America cabled to a neutral bank in Spain to pay another neutral bank in Spain a large sum in pesetas for account of a certain gentleman in Spain. It is known that this gentleman is a mere agent for the branch of a German bank in Spain, and it has also been ascertained that the money was remitted by order of a man in South America who is an agent there for a branch of the same German bank.Between May and August 1917, 2\ million pesetas were remitted for German account through these particular agents.** 350,000 of these pesetas were ren itted in July 1017 ihrough a New York bank.
2. A single wireless message in September 1917 from a German bank to a neutral bank in Spain acknowledged the receipt of 200,000 Swiss francs at Basle, 70,000 at Zurich, and of 400,000 kroner at Stockholm, these sums being received by neutral banks in the places mentioned for the credit of the German bank.On the outbreak of the war Great Britain, followed later by France and Italy, took various measures to cut the lines of communication on which Germany relied. Among other measures, neutral banks in Central and South America as well as in Europe were debarred from using London, Paris, or Milan as a channel for the remittance of any sums for the benefit of the enemy. Neutral banks were in several instances black-listed for using their London account for enemy benefit-How vital to neutral banks is free access to the financial markets of London, Paris, and Milan may be judged from the fact that neutral banks, in order to secure removal from the black list, have been prepared to agree to most stringent conditions. A great bank in one neutral country severed the whole of its connection with the enemy ; one of the leading banks in another neutral country went even further and severed all connection with enemy subjects in its own country ; in yet a third neutral country a bank undertook to grant no further credits to the enemy and to transact no business with the enemy which involved a third country. Intercepted correspondence daily bears witness to the difficulties which the measures taken by the Allies have caused to German financial arrangements.But though the Allies were able, to a very great extent, to prevent the use of their financial markets for operations for the benefit of the enemy, and by their control of cables and mails and by the exercise of various methods of pressure in particular instances to restrict the other channels through which the enemy conducted their financial transactions, there still remained open to the enemy considerable means of financial communication and activity. These, of course, were far greater while the United States were neutral with wireless communication between them and Germany. Alany are the millions of pounds which the German banks and other German institutions in South America were able to transfer over New York to neutral countries contiguous to Germany, to be employed there in the purchase of supplies for Germany and the maintenance of the value of the mark.To-day, no doubt, this traffic has ceased to a great extent; but until American bankers have taken the measures adopted by British, French, and Italian bankers, they will not be secure from being utilised by neutral banks with pro-enemy tendencies for transactions in German interest under the elaborate systems evolved by the Germans for cloaking such transactions.But surely the time has come when the Allies should not rest content with claiming that their own financial markets should not be used for transactions for. the benefit of their enemies. Even if that is entirely secured, there will still be open to Germany lines of financial communication not directly touching the Allied markets  although in the long run operations over these lines are apt to be indirectly compensated over the Allied markets. To-day something more is required&apos; and something more lies within our grasp.It has been pointed out how essential to neutral banks is free access to the markets of London, Paris, and Milan. Add New York to these and consider how little neutral hanks could afford to be excluded from the markets of Germany&apos;s enemies. If our object is to shorten the war by every legitimate means, are the Allies right, is America right, to extend all the advantages of their financial markets to neutral banks which are used by Germany as the means of bolstering up her credit and securing the money for the purchase of supplies without which she could not continue the war ?i The Allies have throughout claimed and exercised the right to forbid their subjects to supply, or to facilitate the supply or conveyance of, goods to neutral countries which would render those countries a more fruitful source of supply to the enemy. The Allies, moreover, have bargained with neutral countries on the basis that their own supply of goods to neutral countries should be conditional on restriction of the neutrals&apos; supply of goods to the enemy ; and to-day America is exercising this right to the full. Let the same principle be applied in the field of finance. If neutral banks^ desire to continue to be supplied with the advantages afforded by the Allies&apos; financial markets and means of communication, let them restrict the financial services which they supply to the enemy. Are the subjects of the Allies to continue to supply to neutral banks those facilities which render them stronger to supply financial service to the enemy ? .No doubt those ostensibly neutral banks which are controlled by Germany, or have been the willing or unsuspecting victims of Germany&apos;s policy of financial penetration, will be forced to become openlv the agents of Germany and to sacrifice [1115-1] &apos; B 2
their business with the Allies. The disclosure of their true position will be a gain to the Allies, not only for the purposes of the war but afterwards. For by bitter experience we have learnt that Germany&apos;s financial penetration is not restricted to financial ends, but is employed as an instrument for very different and more sinister designs. Neutrals themselves will not be sorry to know the quarters in. which Germany&apos;s insidious methods have been at work in securing financial control. But for the most part neutral banks will recognise the justice of the Allies&apos; claim that they should not at one and the same time render assistance to the enemy and enjoy all the advantages afforded by the financial markets of the Allies. They will not lightly give up the latter, and they will, moreover, recognise that the exclusion of the pro-enemy banks among them will increase the field for their own activities in the markets of the Allies.It is not merely the right but the duty of&apos; the Allies to use their world-wide financial supremacy towards shortening the war. A tightening of the financial blockade and the weakening of Germany&apos;s financial position in neutral countries will have two results : it will make it more difficult for Germany to pay for supplies which enable her to carry on the war, and the. injurj&apos;- to her credit in neutral countries will in time react upon the confidence of her citizens in her internal financial stability.October 12, 1917.Finance Section, Ministry of Blockade,Lancaster House, St. James&apos;s,July 24, 1917.Suggested Extension of the Financial Blockade. (Private and Confidential.)Notice to be issued in the Swedish press, say, one clear week before the operative date. Similar notice, mutatis mutandis, to be issued in the press of other neutral European countries.Sweden.The Governments of France, Great Britain, Italy, Russia, and the United States of America have decided that it may become inexpedient for banking houses in their respective territories to continue to have dealings with any banking house in Sweden which engages, directly or indirectly, in 1. The granting of any loan, credit, or overdraft, or the increase of any existing loan, credit, or overdraft, to an enemy of any of these five countries.2. The subscription to, or purchase of, any loan issued by an enemy of any of those five countries.3. The purchase from, or sale to, an enemy of any of those five countries of the currency of any of those five countries, or of any neutral country other than Sweden.4. The transfer of money, credit, or securities between an enemy of any of those five countries and any neutral country other than Sweden.5. The purchase from, or sale on behalf of, an enemy of any of those five countries of any bond or certificate issued by the Government of, or by any corpora-tion or company in, any of those five countries ; or of any dividend warrant or coupon payable in any of those five countries; or of any note, bill, cheqtte, or draft payable in any of those five countries.6. The collection, discounting, or negotiation, on behalf of an enemy of any of those five countries, of any bond, note, bill, cheque, draft, dividend warrant, or coupon payable in any of those five countries.7. The transmission of any document, letter, message, or advice of any kind, by any means whatever, between an enemy of any of those five countries and any neutral country other than Sweden.In each and every case &quot; enemy &quot; for this purpose includes not only any enemy Government and any person, firm, or company domiciled in the country of an enemy or in a country occupied by an enemy, but also any person, - firm, or company, wheresoever domiciled, with whom the subjects of any of the above-mentioned five countries are forbidden by law to have dealings.
The Governments, therefore, of France, Great Britain, Italy, Russia, and the United States of America hold themselves at liberty to direct their respective subjects to discontinue all intercourse, direct or indirect, with any banking house in Sweden from which an intimation has not been received by [date] to the effect that it will as from that date abstain entirely from participation in any of the above-mentioned transactions.In order to minimise the trouble and expense which the sending of such intimation to individual banking correspondents in the five countries would entail upon them, banking houses in Sweden may intimate their desire to continue relations with subjects of any of those five countries on the above conditions direct to the Secretary, Bankers&apos; Clearing House, Post Office Court, Lombard Street, London, E.C. 3, before [date].It will be sufficient if the telegraphic intimation (which should be confirmed by letter) is worded &quot; Desire continue relations,&quot; and is addressed &quot;......................&quot;An intimation given by the head office of a banking house in Sweden will be understood to apply to all its branches, which need not, therefore, send separate telegrams.A banking house in Sweden. desiring to continue relations with subjects of any of the above-mentioned five countries should send an intimation.By &quot; banking house&quot; is meant any person, firm, or institution engaged in banking and/or foreign exchange business.o
