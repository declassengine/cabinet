Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1918.SECRET.G.-189.FORESTRY.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.THE report of the Forestry Committee appointed last year &quot;to consider and report upon the best means of conserving and developing the woodland and forestry resources of the United Kingdom, having regard to the experience gained during the war,&quot; is a document of the greatest importance, and it establishes a strong case for the immediate formulation of a forestry programme to be executed after the war.The Committee&apos;s Proposals.The Forestry Committee propose a scheme for the ultimate afforestation of 1,770,000 acres in eighty years, but they also put forward as an instalment a ten years&apos; programme, including the provision of land for a further ten years&apos; planting, the main features of which are as follows:  (1.) Scheme for afforesting 150,000 acres with conifers by direct-State action, estimated cost     ...      ......      ...      ... 2,245,000(2.) Purchase and reconstruction of 20,000 acres of devastatedhardwoods .........      ............     300,000(3.) Advances to local authorities and private owners including:  .--   (a.) Grants for replanting 50,000 acres at the rate of21. to 4:1. per acre replanted   ......      ... 110,000(&amp;.) Grants for afforesting fresh areas: 25,000 acresat 21. per acre ...      ............ 50,000(c.) Loans for planting and replanting 10,000 acresat SI. per acre............... 30,000(d.) Proceeds-Sharing Schemes, State contributiontowards the afforestation of 25,000 acres at51 10s. per acre ..&apos;.............. 137,500-    327,500 2,872.500(4.)

Encouragement of forest industries      ............      25,000Total...... 3,418,500I am not prepared to recommend the adoption of the eighty or even the forty year programme, at this stage, but I accept the Committee&apos;s conclusion that the Government should make provision for a considerable programme which &quot;can, if the conditions permit, be expanded as time goes on.It ,is true that any scheme of planting started within the next few years can only enure to the benefit of posterity, and it may be argued that posterity can afford to wait until our more pressing requirements have been provided for.Against this view I would submit the following considerations: (1.) In the interests of national security we ought not to expose ourselves again to the risks and expense involved in making good an adequate supply of timber; and whilst I am not prepared fully to accept the Com-[127] - B[This Document is the Property of His-Britannic Majestys Government.]
mittee&apos;s suggestion that we should necessarily provide sufficient home-grown timber to make us independent of imported supplies during a three years&apos; war (occurring presumably sometime after the middle of this century), it would, in my judgment, be imprudent and improvident to disregard the fact that, in the interests of national safety, much larger stocks of growing timber should be held in future in this country than in the past.(2.) The extensive fellings which have taken place, and are going on, at an ever-increasing rate, give increased urgency to these considerations. Since the report was presented the estimate of a hundred thousand acres of fellings has been largely exceeded; and by the time normal trade conditions are established it is not unlikely that the country will be stripped of most of the useful timber of its woodlands and forests, including quantities of young trees, the felling of which was only justified by the existing emergency.(3.) The growing of trees is an essential part of our rural economy, and the settlement of a larger population on the soil, which we are looking for after the war, and which is indispensable for the production of an increased yield of home-grown food strengthens the case for a large scheme of planting. Forests provide alternative occupation, and give openings for a revival of our woodland industries, which have largely fallen into disuse. And the more we can develop the resources of the country, the more confidently can we look forward to retaining the rural population.These arguments for action need not be expanded, as the report goes in great detail into all the aspects of afforestation, but I desire to make the following observations.The work of afforestation will make no headway except with the financial assistance and the direction of the State. This is the experience of other countries, and it is obvious that a form of enterprise which brings little or no return for a /long period of years will not readily be undertaken by private individuals.In the second place, and as a corollary of the foregoing, it is clear that State participation must involve a rigidly scientific and economic system of planting and I management designed to secure a maximum output of timber, and a fair return to the nation in cash or kind or both. Amenities and sport will therefore have to fall into the background, and &quot; preserving &quot; will resolve itself into keeping down forest pests.Further, the price and quality of land, whether purchased or leased, must be determined primarily by forestry considerations, which will mean in practice that land which can be used for tillage should not be afforested, and that waste land suitable^ for afforestation should be acquired and paid for as such (see para. 8, page 5).I do not recommend the adoption of the ten years&apos; programme set forth above, which is based partly on purchase and partly on leasing, and which provides, as I am informed, for the acquisition of 220,000 acres of land over and above the 150,000 acres which it is proposed to plant in the first ten years. Neither am I able to recommend a self-contained ten years&apos; programme for the following reasons: (1.) The first few years would be largely occupied in preparatory work the training of forest officers, the survey and selection of land, raising supplies of plants, and so forth with the result that, for the first five years, planting could not be carried on with any great measure of rapidity.(2.) Experience is required upon the new methods of acquiring land which are in contemplation.(3.) The machinery to be established cannot, therefore, be expected to be in full working order until half way through the ten years&apos; period, and a policy which contemplated that this machinery should be scrapped at the moment when it had reached its highest point of acceleration and efficiency will not bear examination.(4.) For these reasons it appears to me that the correct course is to provide for an expanding programme which shall reach its maximum rate of planting towards the tenth year, and (unless other arrangements should be made in the interval) be &quot;completed at the end&apos;of the twentieth year.
Proposals for action.1. I therefore recommend that sanction be given to a scheme making provision for the afforestation with conifers, and by direct State planting of 150,000 acres in the first ten years, and 250,000 acres in the second decade, the whole of the work to be done on land acquired under a system of perpetual leasing. In the event of Mr. Prothero&apos;s suggestion of purchasing land by bonds coming into operation, this decision as to procedure in acquisition might be reconsidered. I estimate the cost of this scheme at 4,230,000/., of which 1,500,000/. would be expended in the first ten years and 2,730,000Z. in the second.2. I further recommend that sanction be given to a scheme making provision for the acquisition and replanting with hardwoods of 20,000 acres of devastated hardwoods.The estimated cost is 300,000/., of which 200,000/. might be expended in the first decade and 100,000/. in the second.I am advised that it is equally necessary to grow hardwoods as softwoods though on a smaller scale, and that the above area represents a just balance with the 150,000 acre programme.Acquisition would proceed as far as possible under the system of perpetual lease, but purchase would in some cases be necessary where the devastated areas enclosed immature growing timber.3. I also recommend that sanction be given to the necessary steps for financing proceeds-sharing schemes: 1(1.) For afforesting 25,000 acres of bare land at an estimated cost to the State of 137,000/.(2.) For replanting 25,000 acres of felled woodland at an estimated cost of 150,000/.The estimated cost of the two is 287,000/.I should explain that under the proceeds-sharing methods the landowner provides the land free of rent, the State bears the cost of planting, &amp;c, and the proceeds are divided in proportion to the respective contributions. A similar method has already been put into operation in one of the Liverpool Catchment areas by arrangement between the Development Commission and the Liverpool Corpora-tion. There appears to me to be much to be said for it on grounds of economy. The method is in no sense a form of grant to the individual. The problem of subsidising the private owner, as recommended in the report of the Forestry Com-mittee, raises questions of policy of a controversial character, and I am doubtful whether it is compatible with a system of efficient afforestation. On the other hand it is clearly essential that some method should be devised adequate to secure the gradual replanting of as much of the felled areas as possible. I am advised that, unless steps are taken to encourage or enforce replanting, probably not more than 50 per cent, of the areas cleared will be reinstated by effective replanting.If the above proposals are sanctioned the replanting of felled areas will proceed as follows: (a.) By private enterprise.(b.) By the State after acquiring the land.(c.) By proceeds-sharing schemes.   -There will consequently be a residuum of areas which will not be replanted, and it is suggested that the position should be reviewed in five years&apos; time.4. I further ask that sanction be given for making provision for such expendi-ture as may be necessary, not exceeding 1,100,000/. for administration, training, and education, research, and the encouragement of forest industries during a period of twenty years.       , .In making this recommendation I have followed the Forestry Committee&apos;s estimate, which makes provision for a mean annual expenditure of approximately 45,000/. for establishment charges for the first ten years. This outlay may appear at first sight to be excessive. The amount is based on the assumption that a new Central Forestry Authority is to be created (a recommendation from which I dissent), and certain savings can undoubtedly be effected if, as I suggest, it is decided to use the existing authorities. The estimate is based on the employment of 48 lorest officers for the United Kingdom and Ireland at 300/. per annum (taking the middle period of the ten years), and 12,000/. a year for travelling expenses.
The cost of administrative and executive services is high in relation to the planting work to be done owing to the very large amount of preparatory work which is necessary, and the execution of the scheme calls for the enlistment of an adequate trained staff.   The expenditure incidental to this must therefore be faced.The present scale of expenditure on education and research, which is restricted to two or three thousands annually, must, it is clear, be largely increased in view of the training that will have to be given to those engaged in the Forestry Service, and the annual estimate appended seems to me not unreasonable. Education      ... ..... ... ... 4,500Research       ... ... ... 3,000&quot;Woodland Industries   ... ... ... 2,50010,0005. The Forestry Authority entrusted with the supervision of the above scheme should be given a definite programme to which to work, and from which it might depart, except within stated limits, only by permission of Government. Attached is an appendix giving tentative proposals for such a &quot; time-table,&quot; and the per-missable limits of variation. I suggest that before this time-table is imposed on the Forestry Authority it should be submitted for examination to the provisional committee which I recommend on page 5. This programme would he subject to revision and extension at 5-year intervals.6. The cost of the above programme may now be summed up as follows: -	To be incurred 		Total Estimated Expenditure.	In the First 10 Years.	In the Second 10 Years.	1. State planting- programme  .. 2. Acquisition and reconstii ntion of hardwood areas 3. Proceeds-sharing sHit-mes 4.

The Home Rule Act makes provision for afforestation on the existing lines, and it is not to be supposed that the Irish Department of Agriculture, which has made extensive purchases of land and received large grants from the Development Commission, would be prepared to transfer to a central authority the ownership and direction of the areas in question.England and Scotland possess in their Board of Agriculture the nucleus of forestry departments, which could be made adequate to the carrying out of large schemes of planting and maintenance, and the Development Commission provides a body for advising the Treasury as to advances, adjusting the claims of the various parts of the United Kingdom, and reviewing the schemes brought forward by Departments, local authorities, and landowners. Whilst it is true that exceut in Ireland afforestation has not been largely extended under the existing machinery, it must in fairness be remembered that the Development Commission was only established in 1910, and that much preliminary and educational work, including the training of forest officers, had to be undertaken before large schemes could safely be put in hand: Moreover, out of a fund of 2,900,OOOZ. the&quot; Commission was charged to make provision for agricultural and fisheries development for all parts of the United Kinsdom, and it w^s not in a position to incur commitments in respect of forestry in excess of the funds voted by Parliament.
I am unable, therefore, to accept the view that the existing machinery must be supplanted by a central body occupying a wholly exceptional position towards Parliament and the Treasury, and responsible for the entire financial and adminis-trative working of forestry developments. I am doubtful if such a body would secure public confidence, and its creation would certainly mark a distinct and some-what precipitate reversal of the recent steps towards devolution. There remains what I consider to be a fundamental objection to such a course, namely, the practical impossibility of divorcing forestry from agriculture. I am informed that from 30 to 50 per cent, of the areas acquired for forestry are unsuitable for planting, and have therefore.to be utilised for cultivation, with or without a preliminary process of reclamation, or for grazing. The valleys of Scotland and Wales, with afforestation possibilities often contain land at the lower levels suitable for farming; the slopes of the hills lend themselves to afforestation, whilst at higher elevations the land is only fit for grazing. I cannot regard as satisfactory a proposal which would commit to a tribunal of forestry experts schemes the development and admin-istration of which call for a combination of agricultural and forestry knowledge and experience, and I conceive that waste, mismanagement, and confusion would result unless the areas so acquired were vested in an authority competent to deal with their development as a whole.I propose, therefore, that we should look to the existing machinery, duly strengthened and speeded up to work out the forestry programme which I have suggested.   This would mean: 1. The addition to the personnel of a special forestry section of the Develop-ment Commission of, say, four members who would be appointed solely for forestry business.2. A further grant to the Development Fund of 6,000,000Z., to be earmarked for afforestation and expended in the execution of the programme which I have indicated.3. Such strengthening of the forestry sections of the three Departments of Agriculture as will make them adequate to the execution of the programme con-templated.4. The speeding up to be secured by the Departments concerned in association with the Development Commission and the Treasury, acting on the Governments decision that so many acres, subject to the variations indicated, should be planted annually.5. The preparation by the Development Commission in consultation with the Forestry Departments of an annual statement showing (a) the progress made with the prescribed plan and (b) their proposals for the succeeding years.6. The Development Commission through its forestry branch to keep them-selves informed as to the whole question of forestry and timber supplies.7. At the end of five years the Development Commission, if they find it necessary, to submit to the Government for sanction a revised plan of operations for the sixth to tenth years inclusive, together with a provisional plan of operations for the eleventh to fifteenth years inclusive.8. It is understood that the Executive Authorities will pay due regard in their surveys and schemes of development to the agricultural possibilities connected with those parts of the areas acquired which may be unsuitable for planting; and that arrangements will be made for the proper co-ordination of agriculture and forestry m these cases. The financial provision for such developments would have to be met from other sources than the Forestry Grant.Provisional Committee.The legislation involved in giving effect to those proposals is stated in Appendix (B) in a memorandum by the legal adviser to my Department.If the War Cabinet accept my proposals in principle, I would suggest that it would be well to take steps for putting them into operation in anticipation of legislation, so far as this is practicable.The simplest way of doing this appears to be to form a provisional forestry committee, consisting of certain members of the existing forestry committee of the development Commission, and of the new members whom the Prime Minister may decide to appoint as Development Commissioners for forestry purposes. This [127] &apos;       &apos;    C
Committee would be assisted by the Forestry Officers of the three Departments con-cerned and it would proceed forthwith to examine in detail the scheme which I have submitted, to arrange for surveys, and to take such other preliminary steps as may be practicable. It should, I think, be understood that if the Committee desire to suggest improvements or alterations either in the scheme or the time-table, it will be open to them to do so.C.

(a.) The State afforestation is to be conducted on land leased for the purpose. (b.) The replanting of hardwood areas is to be conducted on areas purchasedor leased for the purpose, (c.) and [d.) The terms on which proceeds-sharing schemes are to bearranged to be left to the discretion of the Development Commission inconsultation with the Departments of Agriculture.3. The above programme may not be departed from without special sanction except within the following prescribed limits of variations: (a.) No limits are set on the areas to be planted or replanted in the first year of the scheme.(6.) The variations from the area to be planted or replanted in each year of the scheme to be not greater than - 25 per cent, and + 50 per cent, of the area prescribed to be planted or replanted in that year.(c.) The variation from the aggregate areas to be planted in the first five years to be not greater than - 10 per cent, and * 20(per cent, of the aggregate areas prescribed to be planted in that period.(d.) The variation from the aggregate area to be planted in the whole ten years period to be not greater than - 10 per cent.APPENDIX (B).Note on Legislation required.1. The Development Commissioners appear to have all the necessary powers for making grants and for advances in connection with forestry.2. The Development Fund is limited in respect of sums issued.out of the Con-solidated Fund, but not as to sums voted by Parliament, i.e., if the new funds
orequired are to be provided as a fixed total sum amending legislation would be required for that purpose, but not if they are to be voted annually.3. There is nothing to prevent a fixed portion of the Development Fund being allocated to forestry, nor to prevent all forestry questions being referred to the special section of the Commission without legislation. Formally, their report should be sent to the Treasury as that of the whole Commission, but in practice there need be no difficulty in sending it straight to the Treasury.4. If it is desired either to increase the total number of the Commissioners beyond eight, or to pay salaries to more than two of them, legislation would be required, but there is no limit to the number of salaried officers who may be appointed, nor to the manner in which their duties may be allocated.5. As far as I have been able to ascertain, neither the English nor the Scottish Board of Agriculture have any general power to hold land, nor any specific power, except that which is conferred upon them by Section 5 (1) of the Develop-ment Act, as amended by the Small Holdings Colonies Act, 1916. By these Statutes any of the bodies mentioned in Section 1 of the Development Act which would include these two Boards and the Irish Department of Agriculture may hold land and purchase compulsorily or by agreement for any of the purposes mentioned in that section including forestry.The English and Scottish Boards also have power by agreement to take land on lease, or to take an option of purchasing or leasing land, or to acquire easements; and general powers of letting, managing, improving, building on, redeeming charges of all kinds on, and with the consent of the Treasury, selling or exchanging lands acquired by either method. Any other owner having power to sell, even under the Settled Lands Act, including the Crown and Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, may grant to either Board a lease perpetual, or for any term, with or without right of renewal or an option to acquire land. I am therefore of opinion that no legisla-tion would be required to carry out in England or Scotland any scheme however large which might be adopted for forestry purposes, as far as land is concerned, unless powers of compulsory leasing are desired.I do not at present know what the powers of the Irish Department are as regard leasing. The powers of purchase, whether compulsory or voluntary, but probably not those of leasing, are also open to any local or other public authority (which term is not defined in the Act), to whom the Commissioners may take a grant or loan, so that the development of forestry through local authorities could be extended to cases where land is specially acquired by them for the purpose as well as to those where they already hold it for other purposes, such as water supply.
