f(This Document is the Property of CONFIDENTIAL.   H?s Britannic: Majesty^ Government)0. 159&apos;PROPOSED ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE.(Previous Papers nos. Gf. 106 and 158.)TWO quite distinct subjects are dealt with in Sir E. Carson&apos;s memorandum. First, he discusses the steps which should be taken to carry out those parts of the Taris resolutions which he quotes. These deal solely with the periocLafter the war as a reference to the clauses quoted wrill show. Personally, I have never been a very great admirer of the terms of these proposals. Moreover, they have been in effect rejected by Russia, Belgium, and, I think, Italy. They are notoriously unpopular in the United States, and they have been of great use from a propagandist standpoint to-the military party in Germany. The principle underlying them, however, is sound enough, viz., that the Allies shall assist one another in the work of reconstruction, ancl do their utmost to stimulate and conserve the natural resources of Allied countries!; It. will, however, be difficult to harmonise this policy with that of Imperial preference,! though, of course, there is nothing logically inconsistent in the two policies. As far as the supplies of raw materials are concerned, perhaps the most important aspect of the1; resolutions, the matter is being taken up by the Ministry of Reconstruction.It is urged by Sir E. Carson that in this connection we ought definitely to determine our policy with regard to most-favoured-nation treaties. I agree. But I should deprecate binding agreements with our Allies on the subject. It may well be that the offer of most-favoured-nation treatment to Germany as suggested by M. Clementel will be our most potent &quot;bargaining counter when we come to discuss terms of peace. It would also seem to be of doubtful wisdom to make any public announcement that we intend to denounce these treaties at present for the reasons already given and because the treaties in question are now suspended even as between us and our Allies. Our recent arrangement, for instance, with France for giving French imports preferential treatment is entirely inconsistent with any reasonable peace construction of these treaties. But it has been expressly assented to by Japan as a war measure; and even Italy does not, as I understand, urge that the arrangement is a breach of treaty,- but rather that her claims to preferential treatment are equal, if not superior, to those of the French. Possibly something on these lines might be stated publicly.This brings me to the consideration of the second point, in Sir E. Carson&apos;s memorandum, namely, that we ought to use to the utmost our economic weapons as part of our war measures against the Central Empires. Here I am in complete agreement with Sir E. Carson. The most-favoured-nation treaties do not appear to affect this proposal. They are at an end as regards our enemies, and suspended as far as other nations are concerned. But energetic steps should certainly be taken to complete what we have begun in this matter, and extend it further. The policy of the statutory list initiated at the end of 1915 has been vigorously carried out by the Foreign Trade Department. The result has been the almost total destruction of German commercial interests in the Far East. This has no doubt facilitated the entry of China and Siam into the war, and those events will in turn complete in the Far-East the process so well begun. With regard to South America, we have been in the past much hampered by the neutrality of the United States, and we still feel the continuing effects of her controversial attitude while she was neutral. German firms cut off from all trade with us and our old Allies have found an outlet for their activities m North America. We have made and are making urgent representations to the United States to induce them to change their policy in this respect, and they have quite recently acquired some of the legislative powers necessary for the purpose. But they move slowly.Another very important step would be to cut off from our enemies their financial relations with neutrals. Now that we command, or ought to command, the money market of New York as well as that of London, of Paris, and of Rome, an announcement to neutral banks that they must choose between doing business with us and with our enemies would, I firmly believe, be certainly successful. We have repeatedly urged this on our Allies. But foreign financiers are timid, and we are only just beginning [1030] .....&quot; &apos; B
to get replies. Here again the United States is the chief obstacle, for with their help we could afford to disregard the attitude of our other Allies.Finally, we should consider further measures for replacing enemy commercial houses and combinations such as the Metall-Gesellschaft, which still has many tentacles in Allied countries. 1 understand the Board of Trade has got this in hand, but the difficulties are great and the progress has not been rapid.It will be seen that to a large extent the United States holds the key of the situation. Unless it can be induced to act vigorously and rapidly, not much more can be done. I suggest, therefore, that the general direction of the policy must be left to the Foreign Office, working through the Foreign Trade Department, and the Financial Section of the Blockade. The new Commercial Intelligence Department should also be able to assist. And it would greatly help matters if means could be found to secure by a small committee or otherwise the whole-hearted co-operation of the Treasury and Board of Trade.I append a memorandum by Sir Ernest Pollock, Controller of the Foreign Trade Department.R. C.September 28, 1917.iForeign Trade Department.Memorandum on Steps required to give Effect to Views put forward in a Memorandumon Trade War Policy, dated June 27, 1917.The present memorandum is concerned with the exploitation of German alarm as to economic recovery, by means of trade war measures which are bound up with hostilities, rather than by reinforcing, at the present juncture, the possibility of a trade war after the war. The effective and early establishment of the British Trade Corporation and of a British Metal Bank, which was a factor to which attention was drawn in the previous memorandum, is a matter primarily for the Board of Trade, and is not dealt with further here.As was pointed out in the previous memorandum, what is required is substantial damage of a progressive character so that every additional month;s war will make German commercial recovery increasingly difficult. It follows that what is chiefly important is prospective damage. When once some particular damage has been done its value lies only in the fact that it is an earnest of more to come, and in the fact that such further damage will be all the more serious in view of the harm already done. Our Statutory List policy has been in action for a considerable time, and much of the harm wmich we can do by this instrument has been done. While the fact that this damage has already been effected will serve both to point the moral and increase the result in regard to any further damage which becomes imminent, our own power to do further damage by this weapon is proportionately limited.Action by the United States, and, if possible, by some of the South American Republics, is in consequence by far the most important element in any effective policy on the lines in question ; but a considerable further effect, of a progressive character, could also be secured were the policy underlying our own past actions sufficiently developed. As was pointed out in the previous memorandum, German overseas connections are effectually harmed not so much by the cutting off of trade from German houses as by the actual replacement of the latter as channels of trade. Further, and very alarming, results, to which German attention is already drawn, could be obtained by securing for British or Allied concerns, control for some years to come, over supplies of valuable raw materials, or over facilities, such as wharfage, &amp;c, where these were specially important. It is the purpose of this memorandum to deal only with these methods of exercising economic pressure.1. Any further activity on our part involves difficulty in three directions: in regard to finance, man-power, and need for expert knowledge. It is thus essential that such a policy should have definite authority and support from the Cabinet.In many cases arrangements for powers of issue of capital are necessary if a British company is to extend its business to occupy openings left vacant by the operation of the Statutory List, or if it is to secure control over supplies- or facilities. In certain cases indirect subvention might be worth while. In a number of cases such a policy is seriously prejudiced by the withdrawal for military service of the foreign
travellers agents, &amp;c, of commercial houses, while the total gain to the army from such withdrawals is disproportionately small. Finally, if such a policy is to be pursued to the best advantage, as well as if money and men are only to be used when there is a very real prospect of useful action, it is absolutely and obviously essential that there should be effective expert control.2. The Foreign Trade Department provides a secretariat for the execution of such an extended policy, and its knowledge of the history and results of the statutory list and of the technical side of that work would of course be required, but the Department ought to be strengthened by the addition of a small but very strong Committee to advise the Controller. In view of the continual reference to the Board of Trade and Treasury, which would of course remain necessary, such a Committee ought obviously to include representatives of these Departments. It would appear desirable, however, that any such Committee should consist primarily of business men, in order to secure the very special knowledge and experience which would be necessary, both to avoid waste and mistakes, and also as an essential condition of a vigorous policy.Making every allowance for present difficulties-for example, the very great difficulty resulting from the impossibility of maintaining British exports as a result of tonnage and other obstacles there is every reason to hope that such a policy pursued under right direction, could achieve results which would give financial and commercial opinion in Germany strong added reason to press for an early termination of the war.3. Another, and important, line of action would consist in a judicious propaganda, designed for ultimate consumption in Germany, and calculated to show that the continuance of the war was producing increasingly serious results in regard to the prospects of German recovery. Much material already exists for such propaganda, and use could be made of this and of such further results as are achieved as the policy is developed. M.I. 76 at the War Office, as well as the Department of Information, are already undertaking such w^ork, and it is suggested that it should be developed and extended.4. As has been said, American action is, however, by far the most important factor in the problem. The enormous harm is still unexploited which the United States have it in their power to do to German trade prospects by measures bound up with hostilities aud depending for their effect on the further length of the war. Two practical problems are involved in this connection. First, how an appeal could best be made to the States to secure their use of this weapon ; and, secondly, what we would wish them to do, or, at least, what we should ask so as to put forward the most effective measures to which they Avould be at all likely to agree.(i.) In regard to the first point, despatches which cover much of the ground have already been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, and strong-representations have already been made byM. Tardieu on behalf of the French Govern-ment. It would no doubt be desirable that further official representations should be made both by this country and France emphasising the need for employing in present circumstances any economic weapons which are CEilculated to be of assistance in bringing nearer the point at which Germany wrould accept possible peace terms. Experience would, however, appear to show that such representations will meet with much opposition and much inertia in the State Department. It now appears to be probable that the administration of the United States Trading with the Enemy Act will be placed in the hands of a separate Department. But while this makes it easier to secure vigorous action, a very serious effort on our part will almost certainly be required. Indeed, if a result is to be achieved, still more if it is to be achieved without long delay, it is in the highest degree desirable that the President should be approached directly or through Colonel House. It is not within the province of this Department to make any suggestions as to how this could be done, but it cannot be too strongly emphasised that exceptional methods are necessary if we are to overcome the opposition which is likely to be encountered from the United States Government, and probably, at least in the first instance, even from the President himself. .In this connection and with a view to influencing.opinion in the United States and securing support for such a policy as is desired, it might be worth consideration as to whether one or more important British men of business in the United States, ostensibly at least on private business, should not urge in influential and friendly business circles the importance of trade, war measures,. .It seems probable that the most effective method of bringing pressure to bear on the United States Administration in commercial matters is through the commercial community in the United States, and especially in Lew lork, which the.Democratic partv are most anxious to conciliate from a political [1030] B 2
point of view. The Merchants&apos; Association of New York is probably the most powerful commercial body in the United States.Propaganda of a similar character has been, and is being, undertaken in the most unofficial mannner by Mr. Broderick, of the Embassy, whose connection with the Textile Alliance and other War Control Committees in the United States has given him a wide circle of personal acquaintances among the commercial community. Mr. Broderick would probably be in a position in consequence to give assistance in this matter, but it would appear desirable to use also British men of business, in the manner suggested, both in order to reinforce his efforts and to secure the advantage of an unofficial channel.(ii.) The measures which it would appear desirable to propose are fourfold.(a.) Co-operation in the Statutory List policj^.As regards the destructive side of that policy-the withdrawal of American trade from German firms the present American T/E Bill appears to give the President sufficient, powers. The problem is to secure first that these powers are used especially in South and Central America, where United States supplies have largely defeated our efforts, and where it is in consequence possible to do harm which would be essentially progressive in its effect, and which would have very great effect; secondly, that genuine United States concerns should be encouraged to replace the German houses as channels of trade. Doubtless this will add to the American competition our own houses will eventually have to face, but replacement is of the essence of serious damage to German prospects, and we have to decide whether such damage is worth the price. If it will assist to terminate the war earlier on satisfactory terms, there can only be one decision from a national point of view, and that even if we consider only material advantages.(o.) The liquidation, or sequestration, of concerns in the United States, which are carried on in German interests.Probably such action, more than any other, would create alarm in important German circles; on the other hand, more than any other, it is likely to arouse the reluctance of the United States Government. Fortunately rapid general action would neither be necessary nor desirable. Provided such firms were so controlled as to prevent fictitious transfer, it would be rather to the good than otherwise if liquidation, or sequestration, came successively, and rather slowly, starting with the worst. It Avould only be necessary that it should begin in earnest, and continue fairly steadily.It unfortunately appears probable that any such action would require further powers, at least if it was to extend to concerns which had acquired a technical American nationality. In consequence it is only likely to result, if the United States Government, and United States opinion, can be brought to see the importance, especially in present circumstances, and indeed the necessity, of using every weapon afforded by commercial power.(c.) Parallel action to that suggested in our own case in regard to obtaining control over supplies and facilities, and which will affect German recuperation.Here again this country will have to be content to face, and encourage, and assist large American gains, but these are well worth while, from our point of view, if a satisfactory peace at the earliest possible date is in fact the greatest of British interests.(d.) The declaration by the United States of its intention to use such economic weapons.Special German alarm over the possibility of a post helium trade war was largely due to the advertisement which this possibility received from the Paris Conference. A declaratiou by tthe States of its intention to use, as part of and during hostilities, its economic weapons, would be likely to be at least as successful in securing attention for the significance of a trade war as a part of hostilities, and in arousing alarm as to its probable results.No attempt need be made here to recapitulate arguments already advanced in the previous memorandum and in the despatches sent to Washington as to the legitimacy and humanity of such a trade war. In view, however, of subsequent events, attention may usefully be drawn to the fact that it is merely using to end this war weapons of the type of those which Lord R. Cecil has suggested should be used to prevent future wars. This suggestion has met with considerable attention, is calculated to appeal to American opinion, and forms one possible basis for approaching the question, the more so since it constitutes an attempt to bring within practical politics President Wilson&apos;s conception of a League of Nations.5. Although the co-operation of the United States Government is of far greate importance, the South American Republics could also play a considerable part in the
trade war against Germany. That this fact is already appreciated in responsible circles in Germany we know from the articles which have appeared in the press when-ever another country, however insignificant in a military sense, has either joined her enemies or merely broken off diplomatic relations. Thus even the rupture of relations by landlocked Bolivia caused concern in Germany, expressed in the newspapers, to those who realised how this might eventually affect Germany&apos;s economic interests in that part of the world. Brazil especially offers a very Avide field for measures designed to inflict progressive damage on Germany&apos;s commercial interests, but she has hitherto shown little disposition to take any effective action in this direction. This would presumably require a declaration of Avar and not merely the present reArocation of her neutrality in favour of the Allies.In Central America, Avhere commerce has hitherto been dominated by a number of wealthy German firms Avith headquarters in Germany, Panama and Cuba have actually declared Avar against Germany, but have so far failed to take the only step open to them which is likely to be at&apos; all seriously felt in Germany, namely, the progressive liquidation or sequestration of enemy firms in their jurisdiction.It is very desirable, therefore, to move the Governments of all the countries AAmich have espoused the Allied cause to attack Germany&apos;s economic interests, a result Avhich might be secured by an appeal addressed both to their pride and patriotism, and also to their cupidity. It must, hoAvever, be borne in mind that the Governments of the South American Republics (especially that of Brazil) look to the United States for a lead in matters of this kind. From this point of vieAv also the attitude of the United States Government is of cardinal importance.As has been stated above, Germany&apos;s alarm at the economic measures which the Allies could take against the Central Powers Avas greatly increased by the advertise-ment given by the Paris Conference. It has been suggested that if another similar  but of course more Avidely attended Conference could be held to endorse the policy of a trade Avar as part of hostilities, and if it was suitably stage-managed, it is reasonable to suppose that Germany&apos;s alarm would be greater than ever, and that the consequences at the present stage of the Avar might be of far more direct importance. Further, that such a Conference might have other results of value in helping to bring the small countries into the proposed trade Avar against Germany; that the smaller countries would be flattered by an invitation to attend such a gathering, and Avould probably be the more easily influenced through it to adopt our proposals for the liquidation or sequestration of enemy firms ; and that countries such as Argentina, still hesitating to declare Avar or break off relations with Germany might be stimulated to do so.This suggestion has been carefully considered. It inA^olves in any case some delay, and it might be used by the representatives of some of the countries concerned to secure delay and so to defeat the objects in vieAv. It certainly cannot be said to offer a speedy blow against Germany which would have direct and almost immediate effect. The suggestion is therefore not further developed herein, though mention is made of it to show that it has not been overlooked. Such a Conference might, however, be required, and might be of real use if the purpose for AAdiich it was summoned was to deal with post bellum trade possibilities in so far as a satisfactory scheme can be devised Avhich Avould constitute an effective threat in certain events, and therefore serve as a counter in negotiation, and which Avould at the same time neither be in effect a confession of military failure nor be unlikely to meet with reasonable agreement. The very difficult questions involved if any such proposal is to be secured fall outside the scope of the present memorandum.ERNEST M. POLLOCK. &apos;September 19, 1917.Note.,,. ^ke following are extracts from two telegrams received from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne since the above memorandum was Avritten. They serve to strengthen tne case for the use of such means of economic pressure as are contemplated in the
above memorandum and its predecessor : and they even suggest that a substantial body of German opinion would welcome such pressure as calculated to bring home the true position to German opinion, and thus to facilitate concessions which will eventually have to be made : &quot;Professor Jaffe, editor of the periodicals &apos; Staats- und Wirtschafts- Zeitung&apos; and &apos; Archiv fur Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik,&apos; author of several works on political economy, described as one of Helfferich&apos;s right-hand men, has recently arrived in Geneva. His views, which may probably be taken as representative of a large body of liberal opinion in Germany, were given in an interview to a reliable informant.&quot;&quot; Professor Jaffe further suggests that if Germany could be made to believe there is a serious intention on part of Allies to &apos; corner&apos; raw material and to impose say a ten years&apos; embargo on German shipping and trade should the Allies terms of peace be rejected, it is possible that public opinion would after a short time realise the danger of such a situation, and would insist on less stringent political terms in order to ensure economic future.   The war could in this way be considerably shortened.&quot;&quot;It has been decided [by the German Government] to systematise purchase of foreign raw material after the war in order to prevent, as far as possible, disastrous effect on German exchange. The following measures are proposed : No raw materials to be bought excej)t by special licence ; licences to be granted only to large syndicates or trusts, which are being formed more or less under Government control, to monopolise principal industries. Endeavours will be made to float loans in countries supplying raw materials, experience gained in manufacture of war substitutes will be utilised to economise imports as much as possible, e.g.,, nitrates, new clothing from old, wood pulp, sacks, mats and rugs from pulp, clothing from nettles, &amp;c,&quot;&quot; As regards existing purchases of raw material for eventual import into Germany, this was at one time carried out on a large scale, but partly owing to enormous rise in prices, to difficulties in transmitting orders, and to exchange questions, few, if am-, measures are being taken by Germany to constitute stocks abroad. In this matter Germany depends on goodwill of Allies, and this point should undoubtedly be used as a lever in obtaining political and territorial concessions. Professor Jaffe estimates that all future commercial contracts will contain binding clauses specifying actual amounts to be imported and exported between countries concerned.&quot;
