REPORT.Part I.-EXISTING WAR POLICY.1. Before stating the considerations on which the future war policy of the Government is based, it will be convenient to describe the war policy of the Government at the time when the present Committee was formed. The following summary of this policy is based on various War Cabinet documents, including the Minutes of the War Cabinet, of the late War Committee, and of certain Conferences with our Allies, as well as on a Memorandum prepared for the Committee by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper No. G.T. 1021).Naval Policy. 2. The  naval  policy of  the    Admiralty has  remainedunchanged throughout the war, and has recently been restated in an Admiralty document in the following terms : &quot; The ultimate objects of British naval policy are, first to bring pressure to bear on the enemy people so as to compel their Government to come to terms, and, second, to resist the pressure applied by them so that we may carry on the struggle undisturbed.&quot; Positive results are naturally only obtained by offensive action, but the defensive side cannot be neglected by a country which is dependent on the sea for its existence.&quot; In order to attain these objects, the power of the British Navy is directed into the following channels &quot; (1.) The protection of the sea communications of theAllied armies, more particularly in France, wherethe main offensive lies; &quot; (2.) Prevention of enemy trade as a means of handi-capping his military operations and exertingpressure on the mass of his people; &quot; (3.) Protection of British and Allied trade, on whichdepends the supply of munitions and food to theAllied armies and people; &quot; (4.) Resistance  to  invasion and raids &quot;  (&quot; BritishNaval Policy,&quot; July 1, 1917, Paper  No. G.T.-1272).Military Policy. 3   The approved military policy when this inquiry com-menced was as follows : German East Africa. To dispose^ of the remaining hostile -  troops and to complete the occupation of the colony as soon as possible (Paper No. G.T.-1Q21).4. Mesopotamia. Subject to the security of the force and the capacity of the communications to establish British influence in the Baghdad vilayet (Paper No. G.T.-1021).5. Egypt and Palestine. To take every opportunity to defeat the Turkish forces and to follow up any success gained with the object of driving the Turks from Palestine as and when this becomes practicable (Paper No. G.T.-1021).
RSPOET.Part I. EXISTING WAR POLICY.1. Before stating the considerations on which the future war policy of the Government is based, it will be convenient to describe the war policy of the Government at the time when the present Committee was formed. The following summary of this policy is based on various War Cabinet documents, including the Minutes of the War Cabinet, of the late War Committee, and of certain Conferences with our Allies, as well as on a Memorandum prepared for the Committee by the Chief of the Imperial General Star! (Paper No. G.T. 1021).Naval Policy. 2. The naval  policy of  the    Admiralty has  remainedunchanged throughout the war, and has recently been restated in an Admiralty document in the following terms: &quot; The ultimate objects of British naval policy are, first to bring pressure to bear on the enemy people so as to compel their Government to come to terms, and, second, to resist the pressure applied by them so that we may carry on the struggle undisturbed.&quot; Positive results are naturally only obtained by offensive action, but the defensive side cannot be neglected by a country which is dependent on the sea for its existence.&quot; In order to attain these objects, the power of the British Navy is directed into the following channels &quot; (1.)

Resistance  to  invasion and raids &quot;  (&quot; BritishNaval Policy,&quot; July 1, 1917, Paper  No. G.T.-1272).Military Policy. 3.   The approved military policy when this inquiry com-menced was as follows  German East Africa. To dispose^ of the remaining hostile troops and to complete the occupation of the colony as soon as &apos; possible (Paper No. G.T.-1021).4. Mesopotamia. Subject to the security of the force and the capacity of the communications to establish British influence in the Baghdad vilayet (Paper No. G.T.-1021).5. Egypt and Palestine. To take every opportunity to defeat the Turkish forces and to follow up any success gained with the object of driving the Turks from Palestine as and when this becomes practicable (Paper No. G.T.-1021).
8. It should be noted that the operations in Mesopotamia and Egypt, for the execution of which the instructions quoted above were framed, were concerted with an intended great Russian offensive against Turkey in Asia.7. The Balkans. To keep the enemy forces on the front of the Allied armies, and to take advantage of any opportunity to strike the enemy (Paper No. G.T.-1021).8. At the Anglo-French Conference at Paris on the 4-5th May, the Prime Minister formally notified the French Government in writing that-&quot;&apos; The British Government, after continuous study of the shipping situation, and after cutting down imports to the irreducible minimum, have been forced to the conclusion that the essential needs of the civil population of the Allies can only be met by a reduction of the force at Salonika to that required to hold the entrenched camp surrounding that harbour&quot; (Paper No. 1.0.-21).One British division and two cavalry brigades have already been withdrawn from Salonika to Egypt in execution of this policy. The War Cabinet at the Anglo-French Conference held at London on the 28th and 29th May (Paper No. I.C.-22) agreed to a discussion with the French Government not later than the 1st July, 1917, as to the method of further withdrawals.9. The Italian Front. By a decision of the Anglo-French-Italian Conference, held at Rome on the 5th, 6th, and 7th January (Paper No. 1.0.-15), the question of assistance being given by the Western Allies to the Italian army on the Carso was referred for consideration by the military advisers of the three Governments. On examination it was found that the proposed offensive on this front could not be carried out without detriment to the spring offensive plans for the Western front, and the project was abandoned. Defensive plans, however, were separately discussed with General Cadorna by General Sir William Robertson and by General Nivelle. One result of Sir William Robertson&apos;s visit in 1917 to General Cadorna was that, by a decision of the War-Cabinet (War Cabinet 109, Minute 5), ten batteries of 6-inch B.L. howitzers were sent to the Italian front, and the despatch of six further batteries was approved subsequently (War Cabinet 188. Minute 2). Though originally intended for defensive purposes, they were used with considerable effect in the recent Italian offensive on the Isonzo front. Transport and supply arrange-ments for the despatch of troops from the Western front to Italy have been worked out between the British, French, and Italian Staffs, and on his return from Italy in March 1917 the Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that General Cadorna was satisfied in that respect, though he wished the principle of sending reinforcements in emergency to be con-sidered and accepted bv the French Government (Paper No. G.T.-309).10. From the above summary it will be seen that the defence of Italian territory, if necessary by direct co-operation with the Italian army on the field of battle, has a plaee in the war policy of the Government.11. The Western Frbnt.-^-A ter the comparative failure of General Ni velle&apos;s plan for breaking through on the Western front, which had been approved by the British and French Governments at London on the*15th January,: and confirmed by them at Calais
oon the 28th February (Paper No. I.C. 17 (b) ), it was agreed by the two Governments at Paris on the 4th and 5th May (Paper No. i.0.-21) to continue the offensive on the Western front in accordance with the principles agreed to by Generals Petain, Nivelle, Robertson, and Field-Marshal Haig, and to devote the whole of their forces to this purpose. Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s plans to carry out this decision are based on a resolution of the late War Committee taken on the 21st November last &quot; There is no operation of war to which the War Com-mittee would attach greater importance than the successful occupation, or at least the deprivation to the enemy of Ostend and especially Zeebrugge.&quot;12. Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s recent operations and his prepara-tions for the future are in execution of the above policy, which has for some time existed as an alternative to the French plan which has failed.13. She Eastern Front. As originally designed, the whole . of the above operations, including those in the Balkan and Turkish theatres, were to have taken place in concert with an offensive by the Russian armies in Europe, and in Asia on the Caucasus and Persian fronts. The comparative lack of success of the Allied spring offensives must be ascribed in some degree to the absence of Russian&apos; co-operation. The main object of the Allied Mission to Russia in the early part of the year was to strengthen the Russian armies both materially and morally, and the supply of Russia has diverted appreciable resources from the other fronts.ifforeign Policy. 14. Broadly speaking, the aim of our foreign policy so far asthe present war is concerned is to maintain intimate relations with our Allies; to induce those neutral nations which can assist us to join the Entente Powers, and to declare war on or at least to break off relations with the enemy; and while maintaining friendly relations with those neutral nations, whose active alliance we do not at present seek, to induce them by every possible means to give as much assistance to the Entente Powers and as little assistance to the enemy as may be.15. The United States of America, Brazil, various South and Central American States, Greece, and Liberia, have definitely broken with the enemy during the present year. Siam is about to break off relations; China is within measurable distance of a similar step. Spain, after approaching the Allies, has receded. Apart from the United States of America, the main advantages that the Allies obtain by the adhesion of these new Allies are the release of a certain amount of interned enemy shipping, a cessation or diminution of German propaganda in those countries, and a moral advantage not only in the world at large, but also in Germany, where the realisation of the almost universal reproba-tion of German methods and the creation of fresh obstacles to post bellum commercial activities by the breaking off of existing connections have caused some depression and misgiving.16. In the category of countries whose alliance we have not hitherto sought fall Holland and Denmark. In January 1915, Sir Edward Grey laid down as the condition of any attempt to secure Dutch assistance (1.) That we should have some successes during the next few weeks;(2.) That we should be in a position to send assistance to the extent of three or four hundred thousand men (War Council Minutes of the 13th January, 1915).
\fOn the 22nd June, 1916, the War Committee recommended that the Naval War Staff and the General Staff should draw up plans and make suitable preparation to prevent a possible viola-tion of Dutch territory (War Committee Paper No. W.C.-51 (9)). In October 1916 the late War Committee, on the advice of their responsible naval and military experts, decided that no attempt should be made at present to secure Denmark as an ally (War Committee Paper No. W.C.-79 (6)). Until the entry of the United States of America, Norway was in the same category, but after that event the Admiralty considered that sufficient naval forces would be at the disposal of the Allies to provide for Norway&apos;s protection against oversea attack. By this time also the danger of military attack on Norway from Sweden was greatly diminished, and on the 25th May the British Minister at Christiania was informed that in the changed situation resulting from American intervention, the possibility of Norway being led to enter the war on the side of the Allies was no longer viewed with disfavour by the Admiralty, and that the policy of the Government would be shaped accordingly. More recently, how-ever, the view has prevailed that Norway is likely to be more of a drain on our naval resources than an asset. Large warships, if based on a Norwegian port, will require destroyers which cannot be spared. The danger of aerial attack by Zeppelins is serious, and the possibility that Germany might retaliate by over-running Jutland, which is defenceless, with the double object of securing additional food supplies and obtaining a base for aeroplane attacks on Norway is one that cannot be ignored. Moreover, now that the United States have passed the necessary blockade legislation, it should be possible to secure, by less drastic means, many of the advantages to be derived from the curtailment of Norway&apos;s exports to Germany. The question is at present under consideration by a special Cabinet Committee as part of the larger war problem presented by the conditions prevailing in the neutral countries of Northern Europe.17. The policy of the Government in regard to the work of the Blockade Department is to support the action of the Navy by exercising pressure on neutrals to prevent them from giving assistance to the enemy by exporting imported goods, and by limiting the exports of their own produce as far as possible. This has been achieved by a number of methods, but chiefly by a system of rationing neutral countries in regard to articles imported by sea, which we can control either because they are produced in British or Allied territory, or because, in order to reach their destination, they must pass through waters controlled by the Allies. A good deal has been effected in this direction by a series of agreements concluded with corporations of traders in neutral States, and with the knowledge of the Governments of those States.18. The entry of the United States of America, who have already enacted the necessary legislation, should render our block-ade policy far more effective, though care may be necessary to avoid giving the enemy an excuse to overrun nations such as Holland and Denmark, who cannot protect themselves, and for whom, for the present, we cannot provide protection. Another danger, which has to be avoided is the application of so drastic a system of blockade as to drive neutrals into an alliance with the enemy. This consideration is particularly serious in the case of Holland, owing to the value to Germany of the mouths of the Scheldt and other Dutch harbours. The War Cabinet, though strongly of opinion that Holland must not be driven into the arms of Germany, &quot;have recently decided that every effort is to be made, in conjunction with the United States of America, to reduce the
Propaganda.Internal andlmper-ial Policy.exports from Holland to Germany from one half to one quarter of her surplus produce (War Cabinet 177 (8) ). The Blockade Department who work in the closest possible association with the Foreign Office, have this matter in hand, and the Committee have no intention of altering the policy. The question of the blockade has not been discussed in the present inquiry, because no change is contemplated, but it forms so essential a part of the Governments War Policy that it cannot be omitted from a review of that policy.19.. Closely connected with our foreign policy is our system of propaganda. The War Cabinet has set up a special department, working in close touch with the Foreign Office, to put the Allied case in neutral countries, and to explain the British effort in Allied countries (Paper No. G.-128).20. The policy of the Imperial War Cabinet and of the War Cabinet has been to concentrate the whole of the resources of the British Empire in support of the above war policy.   A great many of their measures have been dictated by the need for pro-curing more shipping to maintain the supplies of the Allies and the needs of our armies.   Steps have been taken to stimulate the output of shipping to the utmost in the United Kingdom, the Dominions, the United States of America and  Japan.    The requirements of the civil population have been cut down, and a drastic curtailment of imports has been adopted.   British ship-ping has been called in from outlying trades in all parts of the world.   Every effort has been made to reduce the dependence of the United Kingdom and of our armies abroad  on imported supplies by increasing local output.    With  this aim a great agricultural programme has been adopted and incorporated in the Corn Production Bill, now before Parliament, deposits of iron ore, that would not pay to work under normal peace conditions, are being opened up; the British and French resources of timber are being exploited with the aid of forestry battalions  from Canada and Newfoundland; and a large number of administra-tive steps have been taken, including voluntary rationing, the cur-tailment of liquor traffic, petrol restrictions, &amp;c.21. To provide the necessary railway personnel and material in the different zones of military operations, restrictions have been placed on railway travelling and civil transport in the United Kingdom, and to reduce the demands on the railways a system of coal regulation has been initiated.22. To supply the needed men and munitions, a gradual but very great reorganisation of industry has been taking place, and is still in progress.23. The Dominions and India have also been called upon for increased efforts.24. The above measures, though forming an essential part of our war policy in its wider sense, do not fall immediately within the scope of the present inquiry. They have been referred to, in order to emphasise how largely the life of the nation is affected by the strategical policy adopted. The Committee have throughout their inquiry felt that at the present time, when we are about to enter on the fourth year of the war, the maintenance of a healthy public opinion is a factor of great importance in the consideration of our war policy, and that the imposition of any intolerable strain on a people, who are already making great sacrifices and sustaining the cause of the Allies to a very large extent, must be avoided.;i246;
Part II. THE NEW FACTORS.25. The principal new factors bearing on the policy set forth in Part I which the Committee have had to take into considera-tion fall under the following heads: (a.) The upheaval in Russia.(h.) The weakening of the French army and people. (c.) Recent events in Germany. (d.) The deterioration of the situation in Austria. . (e.) The intervention of the United States of America. (/.) The new situation in Greece. (g.) The financial situation.(h.) The British position in regard to man-power. (i.) The shipping situation.26. The value of Russia as a military ally at the present time is one of the most difficult factors to appreciate, and the difficulty is not lessened by the success of the recent offensive. Before the offensive began there was a general consensus of expert opinion that not much was to be hoped for from it. The state of discipline and moral among the troops, both at the front and in the rear; the frequent changes in the Higher Command; the bad condition of the lines of communication; the weakness of the Central Government; the existence of a widespread propaganda in favour of peace; the presence and unconcealed activities of persons sym-pathising with the enemy; the frequent seditious and mutinous outbreaks in the navy and army, both at the front and in the great cities, gave but little encouragement that victory could be anti-cipated. The remarkable successes achieved by the Russian army have, therefore, exceeded the most sanguine anticipations.27. Comptent observers have stated that a successful offensive by the Russian army &quot;offers the only prospect of a return to stable Government and settled conditions. It would be premature to assume that the recent successes have been sufficiently marked to ensure this result, or that Russia can be relied on to do more than she is doing already. This, however, is no inconsiderable benefit to the cause of the Allies. According to figures supplied by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper No. W.P. 4), a total of 123-g enemy infantry and twenty-one and a half cavalry divisions were in the middle of June, before the recent offensive, still retained on the Russian front. These included some sixteen (now seventeen) more or less shattered divisions from the Western front. At that time, indeed, the Russian front appears to have been regarded almost as a reserve and a rest camp for the enemy forces knocked about on the Western front. This, however, can hardly be the case at present, and one effect of the recent offensive has been to draw German divisions from the Y/estern front as well as Austrian divisions from the Italian front to the Russian front.28. One of the most disappointing consequences of the Russian revolution has been the effect on the Turkish theatre. Although in Mesopotamia General Sir Stanley Maude&apos;s brilliant operations have achieved great results, notwithstanding the failure of the intended Russian attack to mature, on the borders of Palestine th,e Turks have been enabled to hold up our advance. Moreover, there is a good deal of evidence to show that the Turks are in a position, and intend to deliver a strong attack, with the object of recovering Baghdad. This has necessitated the rein-forcement of our army in Mesopotamia, and has ended the hope that we should be able this year to release both ships and troops from Mesopotamia.
29. The general deductions which the Committee draw from the Russian situation may be summed up as follows: (a.) It would not be prudent to base our plans on any increase in the Russian military effort this year.(b.) The possibility cannot be dismissed that Russia may refuse to continue the war through the coming winter, either because the Government insist on making a separate peace, or because the soldiers refuse to remain in the trenches.30. In regard to the military and political situation in France, the Committee have heard the evidence of Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Wilson (twice), the late head of the British Liaison Mission at French General Headquarters, and of Lieutenant-Colonel E. L. Spiers, Liaison Officer between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and General Foch. Secret informa-tion has also reached them in regard to the proceedings of the French Army Commission, and supplementary intelligence has been received from the Naval Attache in Paris, and from many other souirces. All reports agree that, for the time being at any rate, there was a great, though not unnatural, depression both in the French army and nation, and the General Staff have knowledge that the German Higher Command is aware of this.31. In regard to the French army, General Wilson states &quot; The condition of the army is still good, wonderfully good considering all that it has gone through, but there are signs of unrest here and there which, though not yet serious, make me anxious for a long future.&quot;Later he says &quot; Nobody who knows the French army of to-day, i.e., the younger * men in it, those who do most of the fighting, will say it is as fine an instrument now as it was last autumn, or even this spring . . . .&quot; (Report to C.I.G.S., the 6th July, 1917.)The Committee have received information of a serious case of disaffection in one regiment of the French army, though General Retain is understood to be satisfied that he has the trouble in hand (Paper No. W.P.-19). The most disturbing symptom, however, of the weakening of the French army, is that General Petain was reluctantly compelled to relinquish the offensive operation he agreed to undertake in concert with the British attack on the Messines Ridge. His failure is the more significant that it constituted an actual breach of the undertaking of the French Government at the Paris Conference of the 4th and 5th May, &quot; to continue the offensive on the Western front in accord-ance with the principles agreed to by Generals Petain, Nivelle, Robertson, and Field-Marshal Haig .... and to devote the whole of their forces to this purpose &quot; (Paper No. I.C.-21).32. The main causes of weakness in the French army would seem to be the depletion of the French reserves. At the Anglo-French Conference, held at Paris on the 4th and 5th May, the Prime Minister was informed that the French depots would only produce 35,000 men a month until August, when a fresh con-tingent of 160,000 men would become available. The total French reserves in sight, it is true, are given by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, on information derived from French official sources, as 500,000 men (Paper No. W.P. 4), but these include the 1918 and 1919 class, which are not yet in the firing line. Other contributing causes are the failure of the French spring offensive, after the extravagant hopes that were entertained of it; the heavy
casualties incurred; war weariness; and the intense disappoint-ment at Russia&apos;s military impotence. To quote General Wilson again 1&quot; The collapse of Russia has hit France very hard. For years and years before the war France built all her hopes on Russia, lent her vast sums of money to prepare herself for the war, and, therefore, the fall of Russia has come as a much greater shock to the French than it has to us . . . .&quot; (Report to C.I.G.S., the dth July, 1917).There is also some evidence of enemy or pacifist propaganda in the interior of France which is particularly active among soldiers on leave, and which has resulted in instances of refusal or reluctance to return to duty. This is the more serious because one of the measures adopted by the French Higher Command for dealing with these difficulties is the extension of the facilities for le3,ve.33. It may be remarked that both this method of alleviating the situation, and the release of the older men from military ser-vice, must tend to aggravate the root cause of the trouble as stated above, namely, the depletion of the French forces.34. The weakness in the French nation, which has given everything to the army, is a reflection of the weakness in the army. The causes are similar with special aggravations. General Wilson writes as follows &quot; France is tired; the country is being governed by a set of men which does not contain, in my opinion, a single man of outstanding ability, of broad, far-seeing, and statesman-like views, nor of personal character and prestige which might be claimed as a national asset.&quot; The country-women of France .... the real mainstay of the country ..... are tired. They dread more heavy losses, they are frightened of greater taxation, they can no longer work their little farms and their little businesses as they could during the first three years of the war, partly because they are tired and disheartened, and partly because labour gets less and less available, and money more and more scarce.&quot;35. General Wilson&apos;s views as to the steps required for keep-ing France in the war are as follows &quot; In order to Keep France as an active partner in the war until America can act in the field with real success, we must treat her with great consideration. We must be helpful in every sense of the word, and when she asks us later on to take over many miles of her front we must do so with as good a grace as we can. We must remember that in France we have found ;a real ally and a true comrade ever since this war began, and we must pay her back in her own coin. But we must do more. We must gain such victories, military and diplomatic, as are within our reach. It is not for me to say whether Sir Douglas Haig will gain great successes during this summer and autumn, but it is, in my opinion, essential that he should try; but a success such as Messines, fine as that was, will not be sufficient to buoy up the French nation. The French themselves will win no real success. I doubt even if they will put another serious attack this year. Unless, therefore, we gain some striking success, like taking the town of Lille, our military effort will not, by itself, be sufficient to stay the French. It seems to me, therefore, that we must gain real diplomatic victories as well as such military gains as are within. our power; and at the same time we must
counter the Germans&apos; intrigues and the spread of pacifist socialism, and deal sympathetically and thoroughly with the coal question.&quot; In short, France is beginning to die away. I believe, if we and America know how to handle her, she will still go through the war to a victorious end, and in brighter times she will still be capable of feats of arms which at this moment are quite out of her power to achieve. Without being at all desperate the condition of France is serious, and she merits, and must receive, the utmost sympathy and the greatest possible assistance . . . .&quot; (Report to C.I.G.S., dated the 6th July, 1917.)38. On a review of the considerable mass of evidence summarised above, the Committee consider that the Government&apos;s war policy should be based on the following assumptions, so far as France is concerned (i.) That we cannot rely on the French army to take the offensive on a scale calculated to draw the German reserves to the French front in a strength commen-surate with the numerical strength of the French army. The British army, if it takes the offensive, must, therefore, expect to encounter the bulk of the German reserves.(ii.) The risk of an over-mastering desire in France for peace, though not immediate, cannot be dismissed, and may become serious before the winter.(iii.) This risk can only be entirely averted by a great&apos; success, which may be either military or diplomatic. Temporary enthusiasm, however, can be kindled by comparatively minor successes such as the recent British victory at the Messines Ridge, and by such incidents as the arrival of the troops from the United States of America.(iv.) It will be necessary, before the winter, to take over a considerable section of the line now held by the French. This will involve a diminution in the British forces available for offensive purposes, until such time as the United States of America army can release some of our divisions for offensive purposes.37. Although Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig gave some striking evidence of the deterioration in German moral, the Com-mittee have not felt j ustified, in view of similar reports that have been received in 1915 and 1918, and in the absence of any great military victory over the German army, in relying too much on this factor. Similarly, they have felt reluctant to count on the failure of German man-power or supplies of ammunition. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff estimates the German reserves at 1,000,000 men (Paper No. W.P.-4), although this includes both the 1918 and 1919 classes, the classes corresponding to which, as already mentioned, have not yet been drawn into the French fighting line. Although there is evidence of increasing difficulty in the supply of munitions for the German army, the Committee are not satisfied that, by husbanding their resources, the enemy cannot find ample supplies for defensive purposes.38. The evidence of a weakening in the German people is more encouraging. The combination of a demand for a more liberal system of Government with a strong peace movement, culminating in the fall of the late Chancellor, are symptoms that the pressure of the Allies is making itself felt in Germany. The reactionary element, it is true, appears to have secured a Victory in the recent crisis by the appointment of a member of the
f10bureaucracy as Chancellor. The British Minister at The Hague, however, has expressed the view that nothing could be more favourable in the long run to our prospects (F.O. telegram from The Hague, No. 2144, dated the 16th July, 1917). His view coincides with that of an exceptionally well-informed French expert who was recently interviewed by General Wilson.39. The Committee were furnished with very full informa-tion in regard to the situation in Austria from the following sources: The Director of the Intelligence Division, Admiralty (Paper No. W.P.-34)..   The General Staff, War Office (Paper No. W.P.-33).The Intelligence Bureau, Department of Information (PaperNo. W.P.-37). The Foreign Office (Paper No. W.P.-39).40 The General Staff state that the behaviour of the Austro-Hungarian troops in action, which is by far the most important criterion, shows little evidence of loss of moral. In the recent fighting on the Isonzo and in the Trentino, they fought as well as at any period &quot;of the war. In the recent battles in Galicia, there is evidence that the Slav units showed their old weakness in face of the Russians, but there is not sufficient evidence to state that the moral of the Austro-Hungarian troops in the Eastern theatre has deteriorated since 1916. Since the General Staff&apos;s Memorandum was prepared, the Austrians have sustained further reverses in the Eastern theatre, but hardly sufficiently seriously to affect the conclusion of the General Staff, which is as follows: &quot; As far as the Austro-Hungarian army in the field is concerned, therefore, while there are undoubtedly discon-tented elements among the various nationalities represented in the army, and a spirit of war-weariness prevails among individuals, there is as yet no evidence of such a spirit developing into organised revolt, nor are there indications of a marked or widespread deterioration in the moral of the troops.   .   .   .   .&quot; (Paper No. W.P.-33.)41 All the reports mentioned above agree that the economic conditions in Austria-Hungary are most serious. In the Austrian half of the Monarchy, at any rate, they are worse even than in Germany, and in Dalmatia and Galicia conditions are those of semi-starvation. The population is intensely war-weary, and there are considerable signs of discontent such as strikes, but popular feeling is almost a negligible factor from the political and international standpoint. The General Staff Memorandum however, suggests that if moderate terms were offered to Austria by the Entente and refused, owing to the influence of the German Government, a general strike might possibly follow.42. According to the ^Intelligence Bureau, Spanish circles closely in touch with Austria (owing to close Court and clerical relations) state that &quot; the Austrians themselves are full of astonishment at the Allies not undertaking a proper offensive against them, as Austria&apos;s collapse would then be inevitable.&quot; From Spanish sources it is also stated that there is &quot; great depression and eagerness for peace even in the highest military circles.....&quot; (Paper No. W.P.-37.)43. The Foreign Office Memorandum contains a summary of various peace moves initiated by Austria since January 1917. From this summary, however,, it would appear that (L). Germany was very probably behind- Austria in these
attempts, which aimed at a general peace rather than a separate peace with the Allies, (ii.) It is - doubtful whether -it is physically possible for Austria to make a separate peace. This view is strongly supported by the General Staffs Memor-andum, where it is pointed out that &quot; The troops of Austria-Hungary are so intermingled with those of Germany, and so dependent upon Germany&apos;s military superiority, not only in the Higher Command, but even by the infusion of German officers in the staffs of Austro-Hungarian divisions, that the defection of the Austro-Hungarian army as a whole is extremely improbable.&apos;&apos; (Paper No. W.P.-33.) &quot;44. The War Cabinet, however, have received particulars from a highly secret source of one quite definite approach from Austria for a separate peace with the Allies. The suggested terms, which did not include Trieste, were not such as could be laid before the Italian Government, who have indicated their un-willingness to listen to such proposals, and for this reason it has hitherto been found impossible to carry the matter further. Nevertheless, the Committee regard this overture as a valuable indication that Austria, particularly if she suffered a really severe defeat, might be prepared to negotiate on a more acceptable basis.The United States 45. Great as the immediate importance of the interventionof America. of the United States of America is, not only from a moral pointof view, but also in increasing the efficiency of the blockade, in strengthening the financial resources of the Allies, and in increas-ing their staying-power, and valuable as their naval co-operation has shown itself to be in combating the enemy&apos;s submarines, it is, nevertheless, evident that many months must elapse before the United States of America can render effective military assistance. Major-General Tom Bridges, the Senior Military Officer attached to Mr. Balfour&apos;s Mission to the United States of America, informed the War Cabinet that the first division of 20,000-25,000 men (the first portion of which has been landed) should be in France by the end of July, and that after this a division a month might be calculated on, making six divisions (120,000  150,000 men) by the end of 1917. Even in 1918, General Bridges did not encourage the Committee to count on a greater rate of progress, though he admitted the possibility of some speeding up. By the end of 1918 he estimated that the American army in France would amount only to 500,000 men, namely, eighteen divisions of 360,000 men and 140,000 men for other services. He pointed out that the divisions would require a good deal of train-ing aft$r their arrival in France, before they could take the field. The Committee understand that the first division will not be moved into the line before the end of August.Greece. 46. The removal of King Constantlne and his anti-Ententeentourage; the reconciliation of the two parts of Greece; the return to power of M. Venizelos; the conversion of Greece from a suspect and blockaded neutral to an active ally, have opened up more favourable conditions for the Allies in the Balkan theatre.47. At the present time three Greek divisions raised by the late Provisional Government are in the field, though by no means complete in all respects. M. Venizelos has estimated that this number can be raised to ten divisions in three months&apos; time, and fifteen in six months, but the Greek Staff and Allied experts con-sider this estimate unduly optimistic. (Athens telegram&apos; No. 14913, dated the 12th July, and Lieutenant-Colonel Plunketfs report, dated the 13th July, 1917, G.T.-1400.)
48. Apart from actual military co-operation the resources of Greece, and especially its harbours and railways, will now become available for the use of the Allies. Considered in conjunction with the development of the Taranto route (dealt with in Part III), this is a new factor of the first importance in the Balkan policy of the Allies.Financial Situation. 49. At the time when the Committee was appointed it wasbelieved that the question of financing the overseas purchases of the Allies, which had previously been one of the most serious and disturbing features in the situation, had been greatly eased by the intervention of the United States of America. Since then, how-ever, acute financial difficulties have arisen for the Allies, both in the United States of America and in Canada, and threaten materially to handicap their future military efforts unless a solution is found. This matter is being dealt with by the Treasury, in consultation with the War Cabinet, but it cannot be excluded from the purview of the Committee on War Policy, as it is one of the factors on which depends the power of the Allies to continue the war during 1918.&quot; If this financial breakdown should occur it would be a deadly and, perhaps, a fatal blow to the Allies&apos; cause.&quot; (Extract from F.O. telegram to the British Ambassador at Washington, No. 2776, dated the 17th July, 1917.)British Man-Power. 50. It would be beyond the scope of the present Report toenter fully into the complicated question of British man-power. Certain broad considerations, however, are vital to the problem under consideration, viz.: (a.) The monthly intake of recruits for general service during the present year has been far below the estimates, and is not sufficient to replace the wastage involved in offensive operations.(&amp;.) Although men of suitable age exist in ample numbers, it has hitherto proved impossible to secure them for the army. This is due partly to the fact that they are engaged in business vital to the conduct of the war, such as shipbuilding, munitions, coal or food produc-tion, and partly to the intense opposition to their with-drawal from those industries, which has resulted in serious strikes, exercising an appreciable effect on the output of essential war material.; 51. These difficulties may eventually be overcome, but theimpossibility of replacing heavy casualties, immediately after they occur, is a factor that cannot be ignored in an examination of our war policy. In this connection the Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the Committee on the 19th June that the army in France was 20,000 to 30,000 men below establishment. Between that date and the middle of August the War Office hoped to be able to send out 150,000 men. He considered the position, however, to be sufficiently favourable to justify under-taking the operations in the manner proposed by the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, that is to say, to proceed methodically and consider the situation before making each bound.Shipping. 52. An examination of the shipping situation opens up sucha difficult and complicated question that it is dealt with in a separate section of this Report.   .   .   .   (Part III.)Other New Factors. 53. While the above are the principal new factors affecting the war policy of the Entente Powers, there are many others of a secondary, although very important, character, which can be
Part III.-THE SHIPPING SITUATION.55. The following figures are taken from a statistical estimate of the shipping situation made for the Shipping Controller by Sir Alfred Watson and Mr. Elderton in May (Paper No. G.T.-982) :-End of December 1317.*First estimate.Estimated total gross tonnage of British I 16,162,000 I 14,471,000ships Of 500 gross tons and upwards Estimated gross tonnage of vessels re- \&apos;   6,435,000 \    6,222,000 quisitioned for navy, army, colonies, and Allies (excluding vessels bringing cargo on   return   voyages), vessels trading on behalf of colonies and Allies, -and vessels carrying wheat for France and Italy and supplies for Russia Estimated  gross  tonuage  permanently J    2,500,000 I    2,300,000abroad or in coasting trades Balance of estimated gross tonnage avail- j    7,227,000 I    5,949,000 able for general importsGross tonnage required for general imports on the assumption that the necessary minimum is 36,000,000 tons a year.fGross tonnage for general imports on the assumption that the necessary minimum is 32,000,000 tons a ,year.fSecond estimate. 13,211.0006.222,0002,300,000 4,689,0006,730,000 6,140,000The estimates are respectively for the following rates of losses : 	First estimate.

The 32,000,000 tons estimate was a nominal figure selected by Sir Alfred Watson and Mr. Elderton.more conveniently dealt with when discussing the alternative plans of operations. In this category fall the changes in the con-ditions of the nations not mentioned above; alterations in the relative numbers of the forces engaged; in their armament; and in the strength of their ultimate reserves; communications; in fact, all matters which have changed perceptibly, but not in such a degree as to exercise a very great influence on the situation.54. In closing Part II it is pertinent to point out that there are a good many factors tending towards a possible inability, on the part of some of the contending nations, to sustain the war through the coming winter. Great war-weariness exists in Russia, in Austria-Hungary, and Turkey, and to a less extent in France. With the exception of the United States of America all the other nations are betraying similar symptoms in some degree, the British Empire and Germany showing the greatest vitality. Even in our case the steady drain of submarine warfare, financial difficulties in North America, and man-power, cause some mis-giving as to our ability to sustain the war with undiminished strength through 1918. These considerations have not been with-out influence on the Committee&apos;s deliberations.
The above figures include an allowance for shipbuilding at the rate anticipated in May, when the Shipping Controllers Memorandum was prepared, as well as for the various measures at that time -adopted for calling in ships, more economical use, and other Televant factors.56. It is obvious from the above figures that, if the estimates of losses are realised, a time will come within the next few months when shipping will not be available to carry the minimum of imports, whether it be reckoned at the rate of 36,000,000 or 32,&apos;0Q0;OOO tons a year. Sir Alfred Watson and Mr. Elderton reckon that this -date will be as follows : (a.) If 36,000,000 tons of imports be required-If losses are at the rate of the lower estimate End of August 1917.If losaes are at the rate of the higher estimate Middle of Jnly 1917.(&amp;4 If 32,000,000 tons of imports be required If losses are at the rate of the lower estimate End ofDecember 1917. If losses are at the rate of the higher estimate Middleof August 1917.In short, at some date between the middle of July and the end -of December 1917, we shall be unable to supply simultaneously the minimum requirements of our civil population, the whole of the needs of our Allies, and the whole of the needs of our over-seas expeditions. From that date onwards, if no alleviation is found, the position must steadily deteriorate. It should be noted, however, that the realised losses have been somewhat below the lower estimate, as shown by the following table 	The lower estimate.	Realised loss.	Gross tone.

Tne Committee have enquired into the possibility of obtaining alleviation in the following directions (a.) By offensive operations against the enemy&apos;s submarinesand their bases; (b.) By increased naval protection; (c.) By the adoption of convoys;(d.) By the development of the overland route to Taranto and the Greek railways, thereby shortening the sea voyage to Salonica and Egypt;(e.) By economies in the use of shipping;:(/.) By increased output of merchant shipping.Offensive Naval 59. The principal offensive operation against submarinesOperations. which the Committee have discussed is the bombardment ofGstend and Zeebrugge. As this operation has been carried out on more than one occasion, the Committee decided to enquire into the possibility of its repetition at more frequent intervals, and on a more intense scale. Also they realised that, if means could be found for denying to the enemy the use of these ports by naval means, Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s plans might be materially affected.60. In a Memorandum specially prepared for the Committee on this subject (Paper No. W.P.-11), however, the First Sea Lord points out how unfavourable the conditions are for the frequent renewal of the operation. At Ostend and Zeebrugge there are only ,a few workshops to destroy, ,and at Bruges., reached by canal from Zeebrugge, the enemy&apos;s destroyers and submarines can find all the facilities -they require beyond the range of our bombard-ment. If Zeebrugge and Ostend are rendered temporarily unten-able by our fire, the enemy has only to retire to Bruges until the bombardment is over, when he can return. The dock gates afford so small a target that their destruction cannot be assured at the extreme ranges from which fire must be directed. The monitors at present used for bombardment are fragile unarmoured vessels, and can only be used at ranges at which the coast defence guns find it difficult -to hit them, and it is only very rarely that the coincidence of circumstances favourable to their employment occur, viz., dawn (in order that the monitors may reach their stations under cover of darkness), high tide, good vision for the spotting aeroplanes, calm weather, and a breeze favourable for .a smoke screen. If it mas decided to utilise armoured ships for this operation, which mould ibe dangerous owing to the numerous minefields, they could, owing to shoals, only be employed at 18,000Table II. Shipping allotted to Overseas Expeditions.
Increased Naval Protection.yards range and upwards, and could not see their target. In these circumstances the First Sea Lord concludes that the expen-diture of ammunition and naval guns, the reserve of which is verv small, in order to produce appreciable results, puts the scheme out of court.61. At present naval offensive operations can only be carried out against the enemy&apos;s larger ships on the rare occasions when they emerge into open water, and against submarines by means of submarine mining, or by surface craft after the enemy have reached open water, where no means exist for locating them except at very short range. In a sense, however, the convoy system appears to offer a means of taking the offensive against submarines by providing the escorts with an opportunity to engage the enemy.62. While recognising the great and possibly prohibitive difficulties which confront the Admiralty in devising offensive plans, the Committee consider that the problem should be con-tinuously studied with a view to the utilisation for this purpose of every new device, and to the application to the offensive of the great aggregate naval superiority of the Allies. They learned with great satisfaction from the First Lord (Sir Edward Carson) that a special section of the Operations Division of the Naval Staff is to be set up for this purpose, and they invite the considera-tion of Mr. Winston ChurchiH&apos;s Memorandum, dated the 7th Julv, and entitled &quot; Naval War Policy, 1917 &quot; (Paper No. G.T.-1397).63. Admiral Sir John Jellicoe and Admiral Duff informed the Committee of the latest developments for giving increased naval protection to our merchant ships. The destroyer is still the most effective class of vessel for anti-submarine work, and its most effective weapon is the depth charge, which is being produced in increasing quantities. The numbers of destroyers, however, are insufficient for the many purposes for which they are required. The co-operation of thirty-six destroyers from the United States of America off the coast of Ireland has been very valuable, but in the near future these will be required to a large extent for escorting American transports. The eight Japanese destroyers in the Mediterranean have also proved useful. A few Australian destroyers are on their way home, and it is possible that a few more may be obtained from China and South America as new nations join the Allies. Otherwise, there is no hew source from which destroyers can be drawn except from new construction. The present output of destroyers is given by the First Sea Lord as about six a month, but this is not a net increase as some destroyers are lost, and the older ones become worn out. It is hoped to improve on this output, and on the 25th June the War Cabinet sanctioned a new programme to provide twenty-four additional destroyers by the end of 1918 (War Cabinet 169, Minute 16).64. A new type of trawler, with a speed of 13 knots instead of the 8 knots of &quot;the existing types is now being built, and should prove very valuable owing to the good seagoing qualities of these vessels.65. The United States Ambassador has urged his Government to release large numbers of seagoing tugs and yachts which, if armed, would prove valuable for escort and patrol work.66. The smaller of the new howitzers will begin to come in in July, and the larger ones in October. If these prove a success they should affect the losses from submarines.
Convoys.The Taranto Route.67. The arming of merchant ships, which has practically forced the submarine below water, proceeds rapidly, and on the 14th July no less than 2,621 guns were either mounted; on merchant ships or in hand (Paper No. G-.T.-1435).68. The Committee learned with satisfaction of an increas-ing use with marked success of seaplanes in anti-submarine war-fare.69. The First Sea Lord indicated several other developments of anti-submarine warfare, but in the main these belonged to the more distant rather than to the immediate future.70. It is agreed by all the naval and shipping authorities consulted by the Committee that the experiment in convoys has not yet proceeded far enough to enable a judgment to be formed as to whether the system, which was adopted not without mis-giving, is a success. All that can be said is that some of the difficulties have proved less difficult to surmount than was antici-pated, and that several convoys have arrived without loss. One serious disaster, however, would go far to shake confidence in the system.71. The limiting factors in the development of the convoy system are the insufficiency of destroyers for escorting the convoys through the submarine danger zone, and of cruiser escorts required for protection against raiders and for keeping the convoys to-gether in the ocean voyage. Both difficulties, however, are being gradually surmounted, the former by the provision of the additional trawlers and tugs referred to above, and the latter by arming merchant ships with 6 inch guns as escorts.72. While recognising the many difficulties and dangers of the convoy system as explained to them by the representatives of the Admiralty, and while conscious of the incompleteness of the present experiment, the Committee nevertheless feel that the adoption of the convoy system provides one of the most hopeful means of reducing shipping losses, and they urge the Admiralty to develop it, not only on the American route, but on the Gibraltar and South Atlantic routes as rapidly as possible.73. The project of developing the French and Italian railway systems to carry the drafts and supplies of the Allied forces at Salonica was first raised at the Conference of the Allies at Rome on the 5th, 6th, and 7th January, when it was approved in principle.74. The Committee learned from Sir Guy Granet that with the application of a little driving power and a little negotiation the scheme could be put in operation at an early date. At the instance of the Committee, therefore, urgent representations were made to the French and Italian Governments, and Sir Guy Granet was sent by the Secretary of State for War to Paris, where he concluded agreements (Paper No. W.P.-16) for the immediate institution of the service, so far as personnel is concerned, while the commencement of the service for stores is only dependent on the completion of the terminal arrangements at Taranto. The conveyance of troops by this route is already in operation. The conveyance of stores will commence very shortly, and in a few weeks, or at most a few months, the whole of the stores for Salonica and Egypt that are transportable by rail should be carried bv this route.XI, - - -75. The estimates of the Shipping Controller as to the amount of shipping which will be released by the adoption of this route
are somewhat disappointing, amounting only to four large trans-ports and ten cargo carriers. The economy, however, must not be measured by numbers alone, but also by the saving in escorts, which, as pointed out by the First Lord, are required for every troopship voyage in the Mediterranean, and by the saving in losses, which are still very high in the Mediterranean, notwithstanding that only 5 merchant ships a day enter the Straits of Gibraltar, the remainder having been directed to the safer route round the Cape of Good Hope. Every ship released from the Mediterranean is specially important owing to the increased actuarial value of its life.- &quot;76. The Committee have also arranged with the French Government for a technical examination by British and French experts of the Greek railways with a view to their utilisation for the conveyance of goods from the Piraeus and troops from Patras or Itea to Salonica. The Shipping Controller anticipates that, if the Pirseus could be used, ships could be put into the Taranto-Pirseus service, capable of navigating the Corinth Canal, thereby reducing the passage through the danger zone to the relatively short voyage from Taranto to the entrance to the Gulf of Corinth.77. It is worthy of note that in this part of the enquiry the fact was elicited that on a rough calculation the amount of ship-ping to be saved by a reduction by half of the Salonica force wouldnot exceed the following: &apos;Troops and horses    ... ... ... 8 ships.Stores from the United Kingdom ... 6    ,,Ferry service ... ... ... 7    ,,Meat ship   ... ... ... ... 1Barley and other grain from India ... 6Hospital ship ... ... ... 1Total   ..:       29 ships.These figures led the Committee to the view that somewhat exaggerated importance has hitherto been attached to the Salonica expedition as an element in the shipping situation. The most important aspect of a reduction would appear to be the avoidanceof the long danger zone existing through the voyage from England to the Eastern Mediterranean, but the gradual development of the Taranto route should of itself eliminate this to a certain extent.78. Important measures are already in progress for increas-ing the dependence of our armies on local resources. In France, for example, the whole of the timber required for the British Army is now being obtained from the French forests. In Mesopotamia it is hoped to obtain a large part of the supplies of the army from the country. Owing to the sinking of hospital ships by the enemy extensive provision for additional hospital accommodation is being made in France, Salonica and Egypt, and a convalescent camp for 2,000 men is being established at Corfu. The sick and wounded that must be evacuated from Salonica are to be sent by Taranto. (For further details see Paper No. W.P.-12.)79. General Smuts, who made a special investigation on behalf of the Committee of the possibility of reducing the quantity of shipping allotted to overseas expeditions outside France, has made the following recommendations: (a.) That two Inspectors of high qualification should be sent to the ports used as bases for the Eastern Expeditions, who should examine the turnround of vessels and report direct to the Shipping Controller. A third Inspector should be sent from South Africa to East Africa.Economies in Shipping.
(&amp;.) That the policy of using troops for service in the theatre of war nearest their homes, in order to save transport, should be pursued as far as possible, using troops from South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand for Pales-tine and Mesopotamia, and, similarly, troops from&apos; England and Canada for the Western front.(c.) That the local sources of supply in places adjacent to war zones should be developed to the utmost, and if the Quartermaster-General considers it necessary, special business men for the purpose should be sent to the areas concerned.(d.) That hospital accommodation should, as far as possible, be transferred from India to Mesopotamia, in order to avoid evacuation by ships which are needed for other work.(e.) That the arrangements for the Taranto route should be completed with the greatest possible speed, and the draft agreement be confirmed by the French and British Governments.These proposals have since been approved by the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 172, Minute 1) with the exception of (&amp;), which was not found feasible (War Cabinet 187, Minute 18).Merchant Ship- 80. At present it is impossible to forecast how far the lossesbuilding. from submarines can be made good by new construction.    Theutmost that can be hoped for is that Sir Eric Geddes&apos; proposals for attaining in 12 months&apos; time an output equal to an average of slightly over three million gross tons a year will prove capable of realisation. The question is now under consideration by a Cabinet Committee (War Cabinet 180, Minute 19). The British shipping losses for the first six months of 1917 slightly exceeded 2 million tons. It is true that British shipbuilding will be supplemented by a great programme of construction in the United States of America, but this is not likely to do much more than make good the losses to Allies and neutrals. The German ships seized in the ports of the United States of America, Brazil, and other countries will, when repaired, make a substantial contribution to the tonnage at the disposal of the Allies, but is likely to be absorbed by the transport required for the United States forces.Conclusions. 81. The  shipping  situation  is exercising  an increasinginfluence on the war. It is unlikely that any of the Allies will starve from lack of shipping, but their military operations are already hampered, and are likely to be still further hampered in the future. The Russian programme of war material had had to be reduced by more than half. Italy is seriously short of coal and steel, and her output of munitions handicapped. We our-selves are experiencing an increasing difficulty in supplying the needs of our distant expeditions. The provision of horses for the future needs of the Mesopotamia Expedition has had to be post-poned; the transport of guns to the same theatre is delayed; and the date of the Palestine operations has had to be postponed for lack of shipping facilities. At home the supplies of oil fuel, even for naval purposes, are low. Lack of export facilities or raw material is threatening short time and unemployment in the great cotton and wool industries. In spite of the great efforts made, the stocks of food, though not dangerously low, are below those of a year ago.82. The shipping situation, as depicted above, is sufficiently serious, but in the opinion of the Committee not so serious as to justify the suggestion that has been made in responsible quarters that it will prevent us from continuing the war in 1918. At this stage of the war, nearly every nation engaged is being compelled
fPast IV.-FUTURE MILITARY POLICY IN THE MAIN THEATRES OF OPERATIONS.83. In regard to the main operations of 1917 two alternative plans, both possessing great attractions and certain disadvantages, were presented to the Committee. One was General Cadorna&apos;s plan for an attack on the Italian front, supported by a great con-centration of British and French heavy artillery, and the other was Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s plan for clearing the Belgian coast.General Cadorna&apos;s 84. General Cadorna&apos;s plan is the outcome of the proposalPlan. discussed at the Rome Conference, already referred to in para. 9.At Rome General Cadorna showed but little enthusiasm for this project. Since then, however, he has more than once formally or informally urged its adoption, notably on the occasion of Signor Bissolati&apos;s visit to England on the 1st March (War Cabinet 83, (6)). Since the last Italian offensive General Cadorna has again made the suggestion personally to the Prime Minister through the British Ambassador at Rome, and he journeyed incognito from Udine to Rome for the purpose. Since the Russian successes General Cadorna has again urged the importance of a big artillery concentration on his front (General Delme-RadclifTe&apos;s telegram No. 247 of the 14th July), and urges that 100 guns with 1,000 rounds each are required to make up his deficiency of munitions (Col. Spiers&apos; telegram No. 4103 B.S. 36 of the 16th July, Paper No G.T.-1430.)85. Briefly, the plan is to concentrate a force of three or four hundred British or French guns on the Isonzo front in support of the Italian army, and with their aid to deal the Austrian army a crushing blow. General Cadorna believes that by these means he could ensure the capture of Trieste, and he is supported in this view by Brigadier General Delme-Radcliffe, the head of the British Mission at Italian General Headquarters, who was invited to give his views to the Committee.88. The plan has many attractions. As already mentioned, Austria is war-weary and anxious for a separate peace. She is believed, however, to be unwilling to surrender Trieste as one of the conditions of peace, and Italy cannot take less. A severe defeat involving the loss of Trieste and accompanied by heavy casualties might provide the stimulus. necessary to induce her to break with Germany and to accept peace on terms acceptable to the Allies. The consequences of this might be decisive. Bulgaria and Turkey would then become atrophied and would probably soon have to make peace. Germany would be isolated. Great Allied forces would be released from the Balkans, Egypt, Mesopo-tamia, and the Caucasus for concentration against Germany. As a condition of our co-operation also a bargain ought to be made with Italy to send troops subsequently to France, or elsewhere, to assist the Allies as required.   The situation in the Balkans wouldto reduce its military effort. The shipping situation will probably compel us to do the same, particularly in the distant overseas theatres, which make a. specially heavy drain on our shipping. Even if we have to reduce our effort in the principal theatres of operations, which is by no means certain, that reduction need not be so great as the enemy&apos;s, and should be made good by the gradual increase of the United States&apos; effort. By spreading the deficit over the various fields Navy, Army, Allies, civil needs it should still be possible to maintain the fighting at a great intensity, at any rate in the nearer theatres of war.
be restored and the scheme of Mittel Europa definitely ended. The Dardanelles would be opened up, whereby Russia would be more easily supplied with war material. Italy and Greece would once more draw their supplies of imported wheat from Russia, their normal market. The shipping situation would be consider-ably relieved.87. The scheme, if successful, would give immediate military assistance to Russia, This would be of great importance, whether Russia achieves further success in her offensive or not.88. Another attraction of this scheme is that it makes no demand on shipping. The infantry and all the paraphernalia of a great army are on the spot. The two lines of railway are ample for any amount of artillery and its ammunition.89. Further, Italy is the one Western nation of the Entente that has still ample reserves of men. The chief of the Imperial General Staff gives the combatant strength of the Italian army as 1,769,700 against Austria&apos;s 571,000. Italy has reserves of 531,000 men, exclusive of 580,000 sick and wounded and 280,000 men in the 1900 class, compared with Austria&apos;s total reserve of 885,000, which also has to supply the drafts for the 479,000 com-batants on the Eastern front (Paper No. W.P.-4).90. General Delme-Radcliffe describes the spirit of the Italian troops as good. All the available evidence shows that the Italian army has hitherto failed to make good for lack of heavy guns and especially ammunition. The Italians have 1,924 field guns compared with 1,108 Austrian; but only 2,072* guns of 4.5 in. calibre and above compared with 2,361 Austrian. Italy, however, has 1,520* guns of 5.9 in. calibre compared with 750 Austrian (Paper No. W.P.-4).91. The main difficulty, however, is ammunition for heavy guns. The Italian expenditure of heavy gun ammunition in their offensives has been very small compared with the correspond-ing British expenditure. They have never been able to follow up a success, as after the considerable victories which have nearly always attended their initiation of their attacks they have been obliged to desist in order to build up their stocks again:92. It has been suggested that this defect could be made good by the supply of more coal and steel. The objections to this are that the necessary tonnage can only be obtained at the expense of prime necessities, and that the results would not be achieved sufficiently rapidly to produce the great objects aimed at.93. General Delme-Radcliffe laid stress on the superiority of British guns and British gunnery methods. Our guns have a considerably longer range, greater accuracy, a longer life, and above all incomparably larger supplies of ammunition than the Italian. He also stated that the British artillery is superior to the Austrian. He suggested that the Austrian army, if exposed to a bombardment of an intensity and duration which they had never before experienced, would, in all probability- sustain a decisive defeat.94. General Delme-Radcliffe anticipated that if Allied assist-ance in the form of heavy artillery was given to the Italian army on the scale mentioned above (para. 85), Trieste would be secured. As the Italian lines are now within 12 miles of Trieste this does not seem to be an unreasonable belief. It is probable that there is no section of the whole of the Allied front where so small an advance might realise so great a result.* Includes fortv British 6-inch B.L. howitzers.-[1246] a
95. Finally, the following more general considerations can be urged in favour of General Cadorna&apos;s plan. The enemy would be struck at his weakest instead of at his strongest point. The British and French forces, whose reserves of men are not great, would not sustain the losses, which have been experienced in all previous offensive operations, and instead of exhausting themselves this year, would reserve their main effort until next year, when they will be appreciably reinforced by the United States of America. A considerable, and possibly decisive, blow would be struck at the enemy, and the losses would fall on the Ally whose man-power is least exhausted and best able to sustain them, and who is anxious to put his army to the test in the manner suggested.96. Many objections are urged against the adoption of this plan by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and others.   It was pointed out that if it is to our interest to make a separate peace with Austria, it is equally to Germany &apos;s interest to prevent it.   The withdrawal of 300 guns nearly a quarter of our heavy guns of above 6 in. calibre would prevent us from continuing the offensive in Flanders, and this would enable Germany either to attack the French in force or alternatively to release the forces required to support Austria.   The Italian troops are notoriously and admittedly apprehensive of meeting the Germans, which was one of the factors which deterred Italy for a long time from declaring war on Germany.   The Austrian lines in the Trentino are within 20 miles of the main line of communications of the Italian army on the Isonzo front.   The enemy&apos;s natural reply to a really menacing offensive on the latter front would be an advance across the Trentino front, such as awakened fears of an Italian debacle last year.   Such an operation would not only at once cause a suspension of the Isonzo attack, but would place the whole force, including the Allied heavy guns, in jeopardy.   As a result, the main campaign might be transferred to the Italian front, where the strategical position, so long as the Austrians hold the Trentino salient, is unsound; where the enemy can beat us in concentrating superior force if he so desires, since he has five lines of railway (four on the Isonzo front and one in the Trentino) against two lines for the Allies, the shorter of which latter, namely, the Mont Cenis line, is not a good one; and where the greater part of the Allied army must consist of Italian troops, in whom no great confidence is felt, under a commander who has not vet shown anv very marked ability.   Previous to the Russian revolution General Cadorna estimated that Germany and Austria together could bring 90 divisions with a very superior artillery against him, in which case he would need strong reinforcements from us.   Sir William Robertson considered that there is no chance whatever of gaining a great success on the Isonzo unless we send a considerable number of divisions as well as a large amount of artillery.   To mount the attack, on the necessary scale would be a matter of months, and, pending enquiry from the French, he was not able to say whether the French railways could deal with the great lengthening of our communications.   He did not believe that even an artillery con-centration could be effected without the knowledge of the enemy. The Committee note,, however, that Brigadier-General Delme-Radcliffe, when pressed on this point, expressed the view that secrecy could be preserved by building up on the nucleus of the forty British howitzers already in Italy.   Sir William Robertson doubted whether operations on the Italian front, involving a relaxation of pressure on the Western front, will maintain con-fidence in France and Russia.   He stated that the natural and artificial defences on the Isonzo front are very much stronger than they are in the Ostend vicinity.   He was sceptical as to whether Austria would make peace even if Trieste was captured.    He pointed out that the Allied troops would not constitute a serious
Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s Plan.military threat until they have gone half way to Vienna. He also doubted whether Italy would ever come to France to help us light the Germans. In this latter connection, however, it was pointed out that the Allies, by their sea-power, and owing to Italy&apos;s de-pendence on them for food, coal, and steel, could practically force her to carry out any bargain into which she had entered.97. While holding that the best military course is to defeat the strongest enemy, since it brings with it the defeat of the weaker, the Chief of the Imperial General Stan agreed that, if there is no reasonable prospect of success against the strongest enemy, the next best course is to defeat the weaker, if that is possible. To do this, however, it is necessary to hold the front against the strong enemy, so as to prevent him sending troops to reinforce the weak one. If we were to detach forces to Italy, he considered it probable that we could still hold our lines on the Western front, but this is not certain, and much would depend on the French.   He considered, however, that&quot; It is certain that we could not prevent the Germans from sending troops to the help of Austria more quickly than we could reinforce the Italians. To keep the Germans on the Western front we must fight, and fight hard. We could not fight hard enough if we sent a large force to Italy.&quot; (Paper No. W.P.-I9.)98. Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was convinced that &quot; to fail in concentrating our resources on the Western theatre, or to divert them from it, would be most dangerous. It might lead to the collapse of France. It would certainly encourage Germany. And it would discourage our own officers and men very considerably.&quot;   (Paper No. W.P.-18.)99. Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig explained his proposed operations to the Committee in full detail. It is not considered desirable in any document, however secret, to include full details of a military plan which is about to be put in operation, and only as much of the plan will be stated here as is necessary to give the reasons for the Coumiittee&apos;s conclusions.Naval Advantages.100. Although, as already explained, the ultimate object of the plan is to clear the Belgian coast, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff made it clear that he certainly did not advocate spending our last man and our last round of ammunition in an attempt to reach that coast if the opposition which we encounter shows that the attempt will entail disproportionate loss. The plan is conceived in execution of the following principles agreed on at Paris by Generals Petain, Nivelle, Robertson, and Field-Marshal Haig: &quot;It is no longer a question of aiming at breaking through the enemy&apos;s front and aiming at distant objectives. It is now a question of wearing down and exhausting the enemy&apos;s resistance, and if and when this is achieved, to exploit it to the fullest possible extent.&quot; (Paper No. I.C.-21, page 9.)Under this plan, the process of wearing the enemy down is applied in a direction which, if the enemy weakens, can be exploited to vefry great advantage, while at the same time it per-mits of our modifying our operations if the situation demands.101. The Admiralty have always insisted very strongly on the importance of clearing the enemy out of Ostend and Zeebrugge. As early as January 1915 the Admiralty strongly supported a
proposal by Field-Marshal Sir John (now Lord) French to under-take an offensive with this objective, and Mr. Churchill, who was First Lord of the Admiralty, warned the War Council that, if the military attack was not feasible, both the Navy and the communica-tions across the Channel were exposed to great risk. (Secretary&apos;s Notes of War Council, the 28th January, 1915.)102. The present First Sea Lord, both in verbal and written evidence (Paper No. W.P.-10) has laid the utmost stress on the recovery of these ports before the winter.103. Zeebrugge and Ostend are bases both for enemy sub-marines and destroyers. The submarines based on this port are small in size, and probably do not exceed ten in number. They are mainly of the mine-laying type, and make the Channel very dangerous both for patrols and transports, particularly in winter, when bad weather makes sweeping difficult. Owing to the great rise and fall of tide, the movements of the submarines cannot be completely restricted by the barrage of mines and nets maintained with this object.104. The destroyers are even more troublesome than the sub-marines. They are a constant menace to the Channel communica-tions, and they have necessitated the provision of a regular convoy for the ships bringing food from the Dutch ports, a service which must bei maintained, not only in the interests of our own food supplies, but to prevent the food from reaching Germany. Hitherto the German destroyers have not been very well handled. Instead of concentrating they have operated in small groups, and the numbers concentrated on the Belgian coast have been considerably less than the capacity of the ports. The First Sea Lord apprehended that if once they realise the value of this position they will render our situation very serious. By concentrating the maximum force that the ports can accommodate; by selecting their moment to come out in force; by acting as a concentrated force and descending suddenly on the Channel, they will not only overwhelm the relatively small proportion of our vessels that we can maintain constantly on patrol duty, but they will sink every ship they find in the Channel, including, perhaps, the monitors usually stationed off Dunkirk and Dover. Unless we are able to occupy Ostend and Zeebrugge by next winter, Admiral Jellicoe stated that it would be essential to increase very largely the strength of the Dover force at the expense of some other service.104a. The occupation of Ostend and Zeebrugge would not only go far to ensure the security of the communications of our army in France and with Holland, but would release naval forces, and particularly anti-submarine craft, for service elsewhere, thus strengthening the whole naval and shipping position.Military Advan- 105. The ultimate military objectives of the plan, as outlined&apos; tages. in a Memorandum prepared for the Committee by Field-MarshalSir Douglas Haig (Paper No. W.P.-9) are also very important. If the enemy failed to stop our advance, and was forced to evacuate the Belgian coast, he would be faced with a very serious situation.&quot; His main lines of retreat run through bottle-nejcks north and south of the Ardennes, and any reasonable possibility of our being able to continue our advance on Ghent and Brussels would probably suffice to determine the enemy to undertake a retreat, if not to accept terms at once in view of the dangers and difficulties of &quot;retreat under such con-ditions.&quot;  (Paper No. W.P.-9.)a
Aerial Advantages.The Available Forces.The Character of the Operation.108. The occupation of the Belgian coast, by causing the enemy to cross our lines (unless he preferred to violate Dutch neutrality), would also be of great assistance in frustrating the aerial activities over the south-eastern   districts ofenemy s England.109. For this operation Sir Douglas Haig has available alarge  force  of  -&apos;* divisions, including-* French and---* Belgian divisions.110. The first stage of the operation has already been accom-plished by the occupation of the Messines-Wytschaete Ridge, which has been captured with the object of securing the flank and driving the&apos;enemy from a position from which he could observe and harass the preparations for a further advance as well as to improve our defensive position round Ypres (Paper No. W.P.-3). The later stages are timed to commence on the 27th July, and are planned in distant phases, a particular objective being dealt with in each phase. A total advance of thirteen miles has to be accom-plished before Ostend is brought under long range fire, and a considerable further advance is required before Bruges comes within heavy-gun range.Criticisms of the Plan.111. One special advantage to be obtained by undertaking this particular operation is that our aerial superiority can be used most effectively owing to the fact that the enemy&apos;s railway com-munications are few in number and within easy reach. The naval aerial forces at Dunkirk are also well placed to co-operate. The flatness of the country confers an additional advantage for observation of fire on the army possessing aerial superiority.112. While strongly attracted by the above plan which, if successful, would justify heavy losses, the Committee felt consicler-able doubt as to whether we could carry the entire operation through. Before taking a decision of such tremendous importance they felt it their duty to probe the plan to the bottom.113. One important ground for criticism was provided by a comparison of the relative strength of the opposing armies on the Western front. According to figures supplied by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Papers No. W.P.-4 and&apos;W.P.-8) the com-batant strength of the Entente Powers on the Western front is* These details .are known to the Committee and are only recorded in one copy retained by the Secretary.The influence of so great an advance on Holland also suggests great possibilities.106. Even a partial success would achieve useful results by rendering the important base port of Dunkirk immune from long-range bombardment, and perhaps by bringing Ostend under our fire and so rendering it useless for naval purposes. An advance bringing the Routers-Thourout railway within effective range of our guns would restrict the enemy&apos;s railway communications with the coast to those passing through Ghent and Bruges. A short further advance, bringing us within effective heavy-gun range of Bruges, would most probably induce the evacuation of Zeebrugge and the whole coast line.  (Paper No. W.P.-9.)107. From the point of view of wearing down the enemy this operation has the special advantage, compared with previous attacks, that the objectives are so important that the enemy can-not afford to relinquish them without fighting as hard as he can for them.
m2,611,800 (1,127,300 British, 1,310,000 French, 131,000 Belgian, 25,000 Portuguese, 18,000 Russian) compared with 2,149,000 German. The British reserves are given as 330,000, and the French as 500,000, a total of 830,000 against the German reserves (for all fronts) of 1,000,000. The lack of homogeneity, and the inclusion of considerable numbers of Belgians, Portuguese, and Russians, was felt by the Committee to go far towards compensat-ing the enemy for the Allied superiority in numbers. In field guns the Allies have the superiority, the numbers being-Allies 9,126, Germans 4.556. But in heavy guns equivalent to the 4.5-inch howitzer and above the enemy has the advantage, the numbers being 7,520 German against 6,614 Allies. If only heavy guns of 5.9-inch calibre and above are included the Allies have a superiority of 7, the numbers being Allies 3,267, German 3,260. Having special regard to the weakness of the French army, and the despondency of the French people, as described in paras. 30 to 36, and the uncertainty as to how far the French army can be relied on to co-operate effectively, the question was raised whether Sir Douglas Haig disposed of sufficient superiority of force to justify the adoption of the offensive.114. A further criticism was that the amount of the advance necessary to secure even a partial success exceeded any advance we had yet achieved. The advance in four months&apos; fighting on the Somrne did not exceed a maximum depth of seven miles. It was pointed out that during the Somme battle the French army was relatively far stronger than now, and a large French army was co-operating closely with our forces, and the enemy was also under heavy pressure on the Russian front where General Brusiloff had just achieved a tremendous victory over the Austrians. At Arras also the maximum depth of the advance did not exceed six miles, although this was only a subsidiary attack, and the enemy&apos;s principal forces were concentrated to meet the main attack by the French in the Champagne. Why, it was asked, could we hope to succeed on the present occasion, when the enemy&apos;s main forces would unquestionably be concentrated against us; when we could not count on effective co-operation from the French; and when the pressure on the Eastern front was only moderate?115. It was pointed out that the whole world would realise what our objective was as soon as the attack began. Failure to achieve success would produce a disastrous loss of confidence everywhere, and depression at home, particularly if accompanied by heavy losses. Emphasis was also laid on the importance of not exhausting our reserves of man-power before the United States could bring their strength to bear.116. Before giving the Committee their final advice, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig were invited carefully to weigh the grave mis-givings of the Committee, based on the foregoing considerations, and to compare the plan with the proposed operation on the Italian front.117. The replies to these criticisms are contained in papers by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper No. W.P.-19) and the Field-Marshal (Paper No. W.P.-18), which were supple-mented by verbal statements.118. The reply to the criticism in regard to the relative strength of the opposing forces was that insufficient weight is attached to the very changed condition of the German army since the commencement of the Somme battle last July.  Field-Marshal
Sir Douglas Haig quoted, among other examples, of the weakeningof German man-power (Paper No. W.P.-18):--(a.) The reduction of establishment of German battalions in the field army, and the actual weakness of com-panies, many being only fifty to seventy strong, as compared with an original establishment of 250. (&amp;.) The breaking up of the regiments of the second series of new divisions to form drafts for field units, and men of the 1919 class being already in companies at the front.(c.) The generally reduced physique of the men in the field units.Evidence was also given as to the serious economic condition of the German army. Sir Douglas Haig also pointed out that the enemy only had thirteen &quot;fresh&quot; and thirty-five &quot;used&quot;divisions in reserve.119. The criticism in regard to the alleged insufficientsuperiority of heavy guns was met by the statement of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Field-Marshal, to the effect that the enemy&apos;s ammunition supplies, if not actually short, are inferior to our own, with the result that in recent engagements our artillery has proved itself greatly superior to the enemy. Captured orders prove that worn-out guns cannot now be replaced as rapidly as required, and that iron cartridge cases are being substituted for brass in rifle ammunition.120. As regards French co-operation, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff advised the Committee that &quot; it is necessary that the French should be aggressive as well as our-selves.&quot; In this connection, Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig reported that &quot; French troops will take over a proportion of the front now held by the Belgians on my immediate left, and co-operate in my northern operations. General Petain has also arranged for offensive operations on another portion of his front, on a sufficient scale to prevent the withdrawal of German forces to oppose my advance; and, well prepared and supported by artillery, the operations intended by him should prove effective in wearing down the enemy opposed to him.&quot;   (Paper No. W.P.-13).On this point, however, the Committee were not entirely satisfied. They recalled the statement made by Sir William Robertson at the Paris Conference of the 4th and 5th May, on behalf of Generals Petain and Nivelle, Field Marshal Haig, and himself, that &quot; in order to wear him down we are agreed that it is absolutelynecessary to fight with all our available forces, with the object of destroying the enemy&apos;s divisions. We are unanimously of opinion that there is no half-way between this course and fighting defensively, which at this stage of the war would be tantamount to acknowledging defeat.&quot; (Paper No. I.C.-21, page 9.)The Committee felt that it would be necessary to put pressure on the French Government in this respect on the occasion of the next Conference.121. As regards the depth of the advance requisite to secure success in the proposed operation, as compared with previous advances on the Western front, it was pointed out by Sir Douglas Haig that on the Vimy Ridge one division had advanced six miles and captured three fortified villages without a check, and
without being relieved. Moreover, as pointed out by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, our operations at Vimy were not primarily intended to do more than create an opportunity for the French to deliver a crushing blow (Paper No. W.P.-19.) At the battle of the Messines Ridge no attempt had been made to advance after our objective was attained. In the proposed operations the attacks would be made by definite stages, and a gradual and systematic advance would be aimed at.122. The method of attack was also calculated to reduce casualties as far as possible. Sir Douglas Haig pointed out that the heavy losses in the Arras fighting did not occur in the Original battle, but were due to the fact that the British army had had subsequently to keep on attacking the enemy with the object of wearing him out, and holding him to his position. This necessity should not arise in the proposed operations, and an attack would not be commenced until all preparations were complete.123. After considering the misgivings expressed in regard to the prospects of success of Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s plan, and after examination of the alternative project for an artillery concentration on the Italian front, both the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig adhered to their previous advice that Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s plan should be sanctioned. Sir Douglas Haig did not agree in the suggestion that the British army would be exhausted by this operation, and urged that, if we did not attack this year the enemy would, and we should probably lose the same number of men and guns without any advantage. In regard to the prospects of success he. made the following statement: &quot; If our resources are concentrated in France to the fullest possible extent, the British armies are capable, and can be relied on, to effect great results this summer results which will make final victory assured, and which may even bring it within reach this year.&quot;   (Paper No. W.P.-18.)The Chief of the Imperial General Staff expressed con-currence in this view, but also stated: &apos;: As regards the future, I make no sure prediction of reaching the Belgian coast. I suggest that our plan should be to press on in that direction, and think that the chances of securing good results are certainly no greater in Italy than they are in the north, while the risks involved are much greater in the former case than in the latter. Our chances of complete success in the north depend largely upon what the French and Russians do and upon German moral. I admit that the Germans have still plenty of fight in them, but not as much as they had, whereas our own troops have more. Also the Germans have been told in their press that Messines is the last battle of which we are capable, and if we have another Messines, followed, we may hope, by still another, the effect will not tend to hearten either the German troops or the German people.&quot;    (Paper No. W.P.-19.)124. On the 25th June, pending further consideration, the Cabinet Committee authorised Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to &quot; continue his preparations for the present.&quot; The preliminary bombardment began a few days ago.125. Having regard to the fact that the British army has now reached its maximum strength for offensive purposes, a strength which may shortly be reduced by taking over part of the French  line, and having regard to  the great weight of the
responsible military advice in support of the adoption of the plan for an offensive in Flanders, the Committee have decided to recommend that this plan shall be commenced. They feel strongly, however, that the offensive must on no account be allowed to drift into protracted, costly, and indecisive operations as occurred in the offensive on the Somme in 1916, as the effect of this might be disastrous on public opinion, the importance of which, at this stage of the war, has already been dwelt upon in this Eeport. The Committee, therefore, attach the utmost importance to a frequent review of the results of the operations undertaken in Flanders from the point of view of the objectives actually achieved and likely to be achieved, and the comparative losses of the enemy and ourselves. If a degree of success commensurate with the losses is not achieved the offensive should be dropped.126. If it becomes necessary to abandon the Flanders offen-sive, however, the Committee see no reason to fall back on a passive defensive. They understand that the Field-Marshal Com-manding has planned several operations of a less ambitioas character than the Flanders offensive, which should be useful in retaining the enemy&apos;s forces on the British front. In addition, however they recommend that, immediately on the cessation of the Flanders offensive, if it is not too late, and subject, of course, to the general conditions then prevailing, there should be a rapid transfer of heavy guns to the Italian front. This course possesses several advantages. General Cadorna&apos;s offensive on the Carso will then commence at a time when operations are still practicable in that region, but when it may be too late for the dreaded counter-offensive from the mountainous region of the Trentino. It will enable fighting to be continued, and losses to be inflicted on the enemy, after the fighting season in Flanders is over. If, however, the Flanders operations are successful, the proposed joint operation on the Italian front will not be carried out.127. In order that the change of plan, if carried out at all, may be accomplished rapidly, the Committee recommend that every possible preparation should be made. Staff officers should be sent to Italy; railway time tables should be worked out; and ammunition dumps should be built up for an eventual force of British heavy guns. This action is the more easy that forty British 6-inch howitzers are already on the Italian front, and that the despatch of twenty-four more has been approved (War Cabinet 188, Minutes (2)), in addition to thirty-five French guns. It is also important that the whole situation should be fully explained to General Cadorna.Part V. FUTURE MILITARY POLICY IN OTHERTHEATRES.128. There was general agreement on the Committee that the changed situation in Greece (paras. 46 to 48), taken in combinationwith the development of the Taranto route, renders it unnecessary any longer to contemplate a withdrawal to the entrenched camp surrounding Salonica, as was intended when the Committee came into existence (para 8).129. To assist them . in considering what policy should be adopted in the Balkans, the Committee were furnished with a Memorandum of the views of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper No. W.P.-46), and heard the evidence of Major-General W. Gillman, the Chief of the General Staff to the BritishI
Expeditionary Force at Salonica. General Gillman gave a depressing account of the spring offensive at Salonica, where the attacks were disconnected and unconvincing, the French divisions in reserve having been kept back for the operations in Greece. General Gillman also described the great topographical and tactical difficulties which militate against an attack on the front occupied by the British troops. Not only are our forces con-fronted by strongly held mountain ranges, but the country is inter-sected with deep ravines, where it is very difficult to cut the wire, General Gillman agreed that by means of an overwhelming artillery the enemy could be driven back from the plains to the mountains, but once the mountain regions were reached move-ments would become extremely difficult. There were only two possible main lines for an advance in this sector, namely, the valleys of the Vardar and the Struma rivers, and it was very difficult to move guns and ammunition and stores out laterally from these valleys tc support the mountain fighting, which first required the construction of roads. General Gillman pointed out that for the last year we had been making roads, and we had not yet finished them. The roads had to be built substantially to stand the winter, and for climatic reasons offensive operations were impossible in summer. The further the army penetrated into the mountains the more difficult would the communications become.130. On the strategical  aspect of the Balkan situation,General Gillman&apos;s evidence supports the advice always given by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to the War Cabinet, namely &quot; that the nature of the country, and the difficulties of our communications, as compared with those of the enemy, made it impossible to deal a decisive blow at Bulgaria from the Salonica front alone, and that if such a blow were to be delivered it must be mainly from the north.&quot; (Paper No. W.P.-44.)General Gillman pointed out that the enemy&apos;s communications are superior to ours, and if the Bulgarians are seriously threatened they can be supported by German or Austrian troops, unless the enemy is so strongly pressed elsewhere that he cannot spare them. General Gillman estimated that the Germans could bring down substantial reinforcements within a week. It might be possible, if sufficient artillery were available, to advance a few miles, but General Gillman could see no prospect of reaching any important objective such as Sofia, which is 105 miles distant from the most advanced point of our lines, unless a simultaneous attack were made on Bulgaria by the Russians and Roumanians from the north.131. General Gillman gave a favourable account of the moral of the British troops in the Balkan theatre, and from the War Office the War Cabinet have received satisfactory information regarding the health of the force compared with last year.132. The above information, which merely confirms the very numerous reports circulated to the War Cabinet from time to time by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, convinces the Cabinet Committee that there are no military reasons in favour of a great offensive in the Balkans this autumn, unless a great attack on Bulgaria by the Russian army can be counted on. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff points out, however, that &quot; dis-organisation in both countries (viz., Russia and Roumania) is still so rampant that I am doubtful of their power to undertake the organisation necessary to carry a serious and protracted cam-
paign through to a successful termination.&quot;   The Committee&quot;concur in this view, and are convinced that in the present con-ditions&apos; in Russia, as set forth in paras. 26 to 29, no reliance can be placed on the ability of Russia to carry out her intention to attack in September.133. The Committee accept the view of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that the proper course to adopt in the Balkans for the present is &quot;to limit our forces in Salonica to what is necessary for defensive purposes.&apos;&apos;According to figures supplied to the Committee by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper No. W.P.-4), the Allies had in the Salonica theatre on the 13th June, 1917, twenty-five divisions and one and a half cavalry divisions as compared with twenty-three enemy divisions and three and a half regiments of cavalry, a total combatant strength of 265,000 Allies compared with 301,500 enemies. The Allies had 884 field guns and 370 heavy guns, compared with 802 enemy field guns and 318 heavy guns. In addition to the above, the Italians had in Albania three divisions and a cavalry brigade, a total combatant strength of 50,000 men, with 104 field guns and sixty heavy guns opposed to two Austrian divisions, a total combatant strength of 20,000 men with forty field guns and seventy-six heavy guns.   Thus, in the Balkan theatre, the Allies had an aggregate of twenty-eight   divisions   and   two   and   a   half   cavalry   brigades, a  total  combatant  strength  of 315,000 men, with 988 field guns   and   430   heavy   guns,   compared  with   twenty-five enemy divisions and three and a half regiments of cavalry, a total combatant strength of 321,500 men, with 842 field suns and 394 heavy guns.For the limited object of defence the Allied forces are regarded as excessive. As the Greek divisions come gradually into the line, this excess will become more marked. To lock up a great army in a theatre where there is no prospect of a substantial advance, and where the strategical objectives are so distant and so inaccessible, would, in the opinion of the Committee, be unsound. Consequently, we should aim at a gradual reduction of our forces.134. It is recognised, however, that it may be impolitic to withdraw our forces until we are certain that the Russian attack is not going to develop.135. The Committee recommend, therefore, that our immediate policy should be gradually to withdraw our forces at Salonica from the line, replacing them by Allied or Greek troops, M. Venizelos having expressed a preference that Greek troops should be employed on the Struma front. The divisions so with-drawn should be retained as a reserve, either for co-operation in an offensive, if the Russian attack develops, or preferably for transfer to some other theatre, which can only be decided after an examination of the Turkish theatre of war.136. If there is any prospect of an offensive at Salonica, in conjunction with the Russians, the Committee consider that the Government, as a condition of their co-operation, should adhere to their decision to insist on the replacement of General Sarrail. (War Cabinet 156, Minute&apos;2.)137. The situation in Turkey is largely governed by the fact, already referred to in this Report (para. 28), that the Russians have not been able to exert pressure. The Committee have received no evidence that they can be relied upon to do so in the near future. On the contrary, they have recently withdrawn their forces from the eastern confines of Mesopotamia.   Consequently,
the Turks are in a position to release considerable forces for operations in Mesopotamia and Palestine. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has advised the War Cabinet that a great attack must be expected in Mesopotamia, where the German General Falkenhayn is in command.138. These considrations had great weight with the Com-mittee in their recommendations as regards British military policy in the Balkans. They felt it was necessary to have a reserve force in the Near East which could be utilised to counter any attack by the Turks, or if opportunity offered, to put such pressure on Turkey as should compel her to make a separate peace, a result which would confer very great advantages on the Allies.139. The Committee considered the possibility of a fresh landing in the Gulf of Iskanderun, with the object of cutting the main trunk railway of Turkey, which serves Loth Palestine and Mesopotamia, and is only distant some fifteen miles from the shore. After examining the criticisms on similar proposals which had been made early in 1915, and again on the evacuation of the Gallipoli Peninsula, they decided that, in view of the size of the force required, the amount of shipping involved, and the political objections which the French would be certain to raise against a landing in their sphere, this plan could not be adopted. They considered it preferable that any British forces available for operations against Turke;/ should be joined to existing expeditions, but they did not exclude the possibility of a French binding on the Syrian coast, provided that no British co-operation in troops or shipping was involved.140. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has com-municated to the Committee a detailed appreciation and proposals, dated the 12th July, by General Allenby, the new General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in Egypt, in regard to the proposed advance in Palestine (Paper No. G.T.-1413), and has also presented them with a Memorandum of his own views (Paper No. W.P.-45). The salient features in General Allenby&apos;s appreciation are as follows. The Turks have realised that the loss of Jerusalem, as well as of Baghdad, would produce disastrous results for them. They have, therefore, determined to do their utmost to oppose a further advance, and have prepared a position of great strength on the Gaza-Beersheba line. This line is thirty miles long, and the enemy is rather dispersed, but his lateral com-munications are good, and he can quickly reinforce any threatened point. From lack of water we can only approach within striking distance of this position near the sea coast, and in one other small sector. On the coast, however, Gaza has been converted into a strong modern fortress. In Southern Palestine the enemy&apos;s force is estimated at five divisions and one cavalry division, with at least one additional division in reserve south of Jerusalem, a total force of 46,000 rifles, 2,800 sabres, 250 machine guns, and 200 guns. Immediately available against this, General Allenby has four divisions and three cavalry divisions, exclusive of one division just arrived from Salonica and a division in process of formation which, for some months, will be unfit to take the field, and which he does not include as effective for his proposed operation. The existing force is sufficient to frustrate an attempt to drive us back to the Egyptian frontier, and for local successes, but not for a big advance. The railway line east of the Suez Canal can supply seven divisions; three ca,valry divisions, and the necessary propor-tion of army troops, and with this force, General Allenby could undertake an offensive with a reasonable prospect of success, provided the divisions, which are at present considerably below strength, are fully equipped and maintained at full strength.
Assuming that the enemy&apos;s force in front of him is not materially increased, General Allenby hopes, with seven divisions and three cavalry divisions, to be able to take Gaza and Beersheba, and possibly also Jerusalem. For operations beyond the Jaffa-Jerusalem line, and perhaps to maintain that line, he will need a considerable addition to his strength. This will necessitate the doubling of the railway east of the Suez Canal, which he con-siders, should be at once undertaken. He estimates that six months will be required to double the line to Rafa. The pipeline will also have to be doubled. General Allenby appends a long list of his requirements, which include two fully-trained divisions and a large addition to his artillery and aircraft. As these rein-forcements cannot reach him in time to commence operations in September, and October is the month of rains, no advance can begin before November.141. The C.I.G S. pointed out to the Committee (Paper No. W.P.-45) that the situation in this theatre had changed very con-siderably to our disadvantage since the Palestine Expedition had been initiated. The Russians could no longer be relied on to make any useful effort in the Caucasus. The Turks had reinforced the Gaza front, and had so fortified their lines there, that General Allenby had calculated his heavy artillery require-ments on the same scale as obtains in France. The campaign would, therefore, be a far greater undertaking than it had appeared when considered at the end of the year. It was not possible to give General Allenby what he asked for to begin opera-tions in September, and therefore November must be considered as the earliest date, October being excluded because of the rains. In his latest telegram, General Allenby stated that he would require only one additional division, if he did not fight before November, instead of two additional divisions asked for in his first telegram. By November we could supply this additional division, as well as General Allenby&apos;s other requirements, provided that Salonica is drawn on, and that the necessary shipping was made available to move the troops, &amp;c, and to maintain them afterwards.142. The C.I.G.S. drew the attention of the Committee to the many difficulties and the heavy commitments involved in this enterprise.   Besides the reinforcements mentioned above, these included a demand fofr tonnage, which would require careful examination by the Shipping Controller; the doubling of the rail-way to Rafa, which could be completed in six months from the date of commencement, using rails now in the country; the doubling  of  the pipelines, for which pipes would have to be brought  from America, if obtainable; this would take seven months,   and  until it was completed, full value could not be obtained from the railway, as the locomotives are supplied with water from the pipeline.  The attack on the Gaza position would involve heavy casualties, and it would not be safe to count on less than 40,000 casualties by the time we reached the Jaffa-Jerusalem line.  As we are already in great difficulties in keeping Egypt up to strength in drafts, this was a serious consideration.  Further, General Robertson drew attention to General Allenby&apos;s statement that if, and when, he succeeds in reaching Jaffa-Jerusalem line, he would, perhaps, require a considerable further addition to his strength, and that for an advance beyond that line he would certainly require this addition.   General Robertson emphasised the danger of tying up more troops in distant theatres than we might be able to spare later, when Russia might have dropped out, and we might consequently require every available man else-where; and when the shipping situation might be much more difficult, and the demands for shipping increased by the need of
transporting more coal to Italy and France, and troops from America to France.   In conclusion lie added: -&quot;It is for the War Cabinet to say whether the political advantages to be gained by the occupation of Jerusalem and Southern Palestine are such as to justify our undertaking, at this stage of the war, a new and great campaign, with the consequent strain on our shipping and all other resources. It is my present opinion that the purely military advantages to be gained would not justify the expenditure of force required and the risks incurred, though I do not say that this opinion may not be modified later. My proposal, therefore, is that we should at once proceed with doubling the railway, subject to what may be ascertained in regard to the water pipes; make General Allenby&apos;s present force up to strength in all possible respects; withdraw a certain number of guns from Salonica at once; and decide later on whether the cam-paign can be undertaken or not. In the meantime General Allenby should take any advantage offered of pressing the Turk. I think he ought to be able to do much more in this respect than he thinks with the force he now has, when it is brought up to strength in the manner I have suggested, especially as the Arabs in that quarter are causing consider-able trouble to the Turks. It is very important he should be as active as his means permit, so as indirectly to assist General Maude.&quot;143. The above advice was accepted by the Committee.Mesopotamia. 144. According to figures supplied by the C.I.G.S. (PaperNo. W.P.-4), the British forces in Mesopotamia on the 13th June, 1917, amounted to five divisions and one cavalry division, with a combatant strength of 93,300 men, 152 field guns, and 72 heavy-guns, compared with a Turkish force of six divisions and one cavalry division, with a combatant strength of 31,500 men, 97 field guns, and 15 heavy guns. In this theatre there were in addition three-and-a-half Russian divisions and seven cavalry divisions, with a combatant strength of 82,000 men, 104 field guns, and fom; heavy guns, but the Russian force was much disorganised, indif-ferently supplied, and did not hold any considerable Turkish force.145. To enable General Maude to meet the threatened Turkish offensive, referred to in paragraph 137, the Committee were informed that General Maude was being reinforced by nine field batteries, a heavy battery, and an air squadron, in addition to two 6-inch howitzer batteries to be despatched shortly. His Indian battalions were also being brought up to British establish-ment, though this was not possible in the case of his British bat-talions on the Indian establishment. Besides this six Indian battalions were being sent to release troops at present on the Lines of Communication (C.I.G.S. to G.O.C., Mesopotamia, 2nd July, 1917). In a telegram dated the 4th July, 1917, General Maude, in acknowledging the notification of these reinforcements, stated that, if his outstanding demands, especially as.regards mechanical transport, were fully met, and his ranks were promptly filled as casualties occurred, he felt no anxiety as to his ability to meet successfully considerably superior numbers of Turks.146. The Committee considered that the development of the situation in Mesopotamia requires the most careful watching, and that the probability of a Turkish attack in Mesopotamia provides a strong additional argument in favour of the release of the super-fluous forces now locked up in the Balkan theatre to create an emergency reserve for service in the Turkish theatre if required.
Part VI.-SUMMARYOF RECOMMENDATIONS.Naval Policy.Military Policy in the Western and Southern Theatres.1. The Committee do not recommend any departure from the naval policy as set forth in the Admiralty Memorandum of the 1st July, 1917 (Paper No. G.T.-1272). They draw the attention of the Admiralty, however, to the recommendations in this report, urging the continuous study of offensive operations (para. 62) and the development of convoys (para. 72).The conclusions as to military policy in the Western and Southern theatres, in the Balkans and Palestine, were discussed at a full meeting of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 191 (a)), and are as follows: 2. The War Cabinet approved that the military policy in the Western and Southern theatres should be as follows: (a.) The Field-Marshal Commanding the British Expedition-ary Force in France should be authorised to carry out the plans for which he has prepared, as explained by him to the Cabinet Committee on War Policy on the 19th June.(&amp;.) If it appears probable in the execution of these plans that the results are not commensurate with the effort made and the losses incurred, the whole question should be re-examined by the War Cabinet with a view to the cessation of this offensive and the adoption of an alter-native plan.(c.) The only alternative plan which at present commends itself to the Cabinet Committee is General Cadorna&apos;s proposal for a great offensive against Austria, sup-ported by British and, if the French are prepared to co-operate, by French heavy artillery.(d.) In order that this alternative plan may be feasible in the event of a decision being taken to desist from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s plan of operations, arrangements should be made forthwith for giving effect to it; for a gradual accumulation of reserves of ammunition for an eventual force of British heavy guns on the Italian front; and for all other measures that can be taken in advance to facilitate the execution of the plan.(e.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should take immediate steps to give effect to these decisions.(/.) Pressure should be put on the French Government to co-operate wijth all their forces in the forthcoming British offensive in Flanders; and to send heavy guns to Italy if the proposal in (c) is adopted.3. In regard to (c) the War Cabinet approved a proposal by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that he should discuss the plan for an offensive against Austria, supported by British and, perhaps, by French heavy artillery, with General CadornaWhether it should be employed as a direct reinforcement in Mesopotamia, or indirectly to assist General Maude by a thrust in Palestine, depends upon the development of the situation. For the present, however, the Committee are satisfied with the steps that have been taken to provide against a contingency, the full effect of which cannot yet be foreseen. So far as general policy is concerned -and it is general policy with which this Report deals the Committee see no reason to modify the principles on which General Maude&apos;s present instructions are based (para,. 4).
and General Foch in his own way at the forthcoming Conference in Paris, as an alternative plan which may become possible at a later date.It was agreed that it would be undesirable to make definite arrangements with General Cadorna at once on this question, as the fact of our doing so might induce him to postpone or, at any rate, to diminish the offensive operations he is now planning, which are of great importance in view of the success that has ^attended the Russian offensive. For the same reason it was agreed that the moment had not yet come to make any bargain with the Italian Government as to their continued co-operation in the war in the event of such a blow being struck as would induce Austria to make a separate peace.4. With reference to (d), the War Cabinet, after hearing a statement by the Master-General of the Ordnance in regard to the reserves and output of heavy artillery ammunition, take note that, for.the moment, Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s probable requirements do not admit of our sending any nature of heavy ammunition other than a little 8 in. or 9.2 in. howitzer ammunition, if General Cadorna requires such guns, for the purpose of an accumulation in Italy over and above the very ample supplies of 6 in. howitzer ammu-nition already being sent for the howitzers on the Italian front, or about to be despatched there.5. The War Cabinet also take note that arrangements have been considered by British Staff Officers, in conjunction with the Italian and French General Staffs, for the possible transfer of troops from the Western to the Italian fronts, and are in as advanced-a state of preparation as it is possible to make them at the present time.With reference to (/), the War Cabinet also approved the proposal of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that he should insist in the discussion with Generals Foch and Cadorna on the French contributing to any reinforcements made on the Italian front either by supplying some of the guns or by reducing the demands which we have heard are to be made upon us to take over more line.Military Policy in 6. After a full discussion of the military situation in thethe Balkans. Balkan and Turkish theatres of war, the War Cabinet approvedthat the military policy to be aimed at in the Balkans should beas follows: -(a.) The abandonment of the policy of withdrawal of the Allied armies to the entrenched camp surrounding Salonica.(6.) The gradual withdrawal from the fighting line of as many divisions as possible of the British Army at Salonica, their places being taken by Greek or other Allied troops.(c.) The immediate withdrawal from Salonica of one division as reinforcement to the British Expeditionary Force in Egypt.(d.) The formation of the remaining divisions withdrawn from the fighting line into a general reserve for service in any theatre where they might be required, according as the military situation develops.7. It was generally agreed that an offensive operation in the &quot;Balkans offered but little prospect of success, and that the Russians could not be relied on to carry out a successful offensive against Bulgaria. In this latter connection the Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a telegram received from French sources which indicated that the Russian Army was not likely to be in a position to take the offensive in the Dobrudja.   It was also agreed that
Military Policy in Palestine.Mesopotamia.Military Policy in German East Africa.Foreign Policy..othe maintenance of 600,000 Allied troops in the Balkans against 300,000 Bulgarians is a great waste of material.It was pointed out, however, that the British representatives at Paris might find themselves in a very difficult position in pressing the policy laid down above. The Russian representa-tives might insist that a Russian offensive would be successful, and would press strongly for co-operation from Salonica, and they would be supported by the Serbians and Greeks, probably also by the French, and possibly by the Italians. A direct refusal to co-operate in an offensive might have serious political consequences.The War Cabinet therefore decided that some latitude must be left to their representatives, who, however, should make the most of the facts that we are sustaining the brunt of the war against Turkey; that we cannot at present foresee the develop-ments in the Turkish theatres; that in view of the failure of the Russian offensive in the Caucasus to develop, it is impossible to foresee where the reinforcements may be required; that for this reason it is essential to us to have a reserve immediately avail-able, which at present we do not possess; and that for the present there is no intention of removing more than the one division to be transferred to Egypt. Further, with a view to meeting any such combination of the Allied representatives at the Conference as has been referred to, great stress was laid upon the desirability, if possible, of coming to a preliminary understanding with the French Government.8. The War Cabinet agreed with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that until it was in possession of particulars of the tonnage required to meet General Allenby&apos;s proposals, and was assured of our power to supply this tonnage and meet our other essential shipping requirements, no decision could be taken as regards the proposed offensive in Palestine. In addition to the despatch of one division from Salonica they decided that the doubling of the railway east of the Suez Canal should be at once proceeded with, subject to what may be ascertained in regard to the water pipes; that General Allenby&apos;s present force should be made up to strength in all possible respects; that pending a final decision General Allenby should be instructed to take any advantage offered of pressing the Turks, and to be as active as his means permit so as indirectly to assist General Maude.9. While recognising that the situation in Mesopotamia requires careful watching, the Committee see no reason at present for modifying the principles on which General Maude&apos;s instruc-tions are based.10. The Committee recommend no change in policy.11. The Committee feel that the time has come when efforts might be made to detach some of Germany&apos;s allies, but pending discussions with our Allies, they make no detailed recommenda-tions on this subject.(Signed) -D.
