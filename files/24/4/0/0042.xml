- fi[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty!s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1918.SECRET.G.-191. fi     &apos;REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE EXPORT OFPRINTED MATTER.(Previous Paper No. G.T.-1332.)THIS Committee was appointed by the War Cabinet (Minute 232 (13) of the 13th September, 1917) to consider the regulations which govern the export of printed matter to foreign countries.   The Committee are : The Right Hon. Sir Edward Carson, K.C., M.P. (in the Chair). The Right Hon. Sir George Cave, M.P.Sir Edward Trotjp, K.C.B., Permanent Under-Secretary of State, Home Office..Major-General- Sir G. M. W. Macdonogh, K.C.M.G., C.B., Director ofMilitary Intelligence, War Office. Colonel G,. S. H. Pearson, C.M.G., General Staff, War Office. Colonel John Buchan, Director of Information.Mr. Wicks (Secretary).Under the Defence of the Realm Regulations 24 and 24 b, while there is power to stop injurious publications leaving the country, provided they can be intercepted, the despatch of such publications under a general permit to export is not illegal, and there is therefore no offence committed by those who succeed in exporting copies of such publications under any general permit to export that they may hold. Moreover, the present regulations apply to export only to enemy and neutral countries, and not to Allied countries, e.g., France and Italy. Consequently it is impossible to secure that no copies of undesirable publications shall leave the country and ultimately find their way to the enemy.The Committee recommend that the Regulations 24 and 24 b shall be amended as shown in the Appendix 2 of this report.The effect of these amendments will be to make it an offence to export publications, the export of which has been prohibited, and to extend the regulations to Allied countries as well as to neutral and enemy countries.(Signed) EDWARD CARSON.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., January 21, 19! 8.[196]B
