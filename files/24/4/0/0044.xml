Gaptaia CbnenUbnfiBc[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]   -     *Printed for the War Cabinet.   Februaryr 1918.SECRET. G.-193.SOLDIERS&apos; AND SAILORS&apos; PAY COMMITTEE.Fourth and Final Report.(Previous Papers, G.-154, G.-172, G.-188, and War Cabinet 235 (13), 280 (11),and 320 (8).)1. IN this fourth and final Report the Committee deals with certain matters incidental to the main questions which have now been disposed of by the War Cabinet on the basis of the recommendations made in their earlier reports.Grants by the Civil Liabilities Committee.2. It is necessary for the guidance of that Committee to lay down the general policy which should govern them in dealing with future applications for grants or renewals of allowances under the powers vested in it. Such grants (other than the grants specifically made for maintenance of children) are intended to meet specific items of expenditure, such as rent, rates, mortgage interest, &amp;c. On the other hand, the grants of increased pay and children&apos;s allowances now approved for junior officers are made mainly for the purpose of meeting charges which fall on the officer in respect of his family under the changed conditions of the present day in excess of those which the former scales of pay were designed to meet.3. In these circumstances we think it clear that where an officers income from Army or Navy funds is increased under the new scheme there can be no automatic corresponding reduction of any grant that may have been made by the Civil Liabilities Committee. That Committee will no doubt in the ordinary course review the whole circumstances of the family under the new conditions, but it is our intention that generous consideration should be extended to the diminished purchasing power of money, the rise in the cost of living and travelling, and other relevant circumstances. In j particular, there should be no attempt in any case to recover a grant made by the Civil I Liabilities Committee for a period subsequent to the 1st October last, on the ground that the retrospective effect given to the new Army and Navy grants constitutes a double issue.Adopted Children.4. In view of the possibility of undesirable laxity if there were no restriction on the grant of allowances in respect of adopted children, we have found it necessary to restrict such allowances normally to children adopted before the date from which the grant takes effect (1st October, 1917); but we recommend that any cases of adoption which occurred between that date and the promulgation of the orders shall receive special consideration, where the circumstances warrant it.Hospital Stoppages.5. Under existing regulations, the Army Officer admitted to hospital on account of wounds received in action or illness contracted while on service in the field receives free treatment. Other Army Officers are liable to a stoppage of 2s. 6d. a day, which may be remitted in whole or part at the discretion of the Officer Commanding where injury or sickness has been caused by military service or in other special circumstances. While we do not consider that an officer should be entitled in all circumstances to free [218]
treatment in hospital during the war, we think the regulations should be so amended for the period of the war as to give that right in all cases of injury or sickness clearly attributable to military service, whether in field or otherwise.Existing regulations for the Navy do not require any stoppage in respect of the maintenance of a Naval Officer in hospital while on full pay. No change is therefore desired, but a concession similar to that proposed for the Army should be granted to officers of the Royal Marines.Half-Pay.Army.6. The rates of half-pay now current for junior officers are of very ancient date, and no longer justify their name. Thus, for a Subaltern the minimum rate of half-pay (3s.) belongs to the time when the full pay stood at 5s. id. a day. The full-pay rate is now just double (10s. 6d.). For Army Regimental Officers during war time half-pay is practically limited to those who have completed the period (twelve or eighteen months) of sick leave on full-pay to which they are entitled. The number of such officers is not large, and the hardships inflicted on the individual may be considerable. We recommend a minimum rate of 5s. a day for Subaltern officers. For Captains and higher ranks the rates (7s. and upwards) should remain as at present.Navy. .7. We recommend that under normal circumstances, for all officers below Flag rank half-pay should be abolished for the period of the war. It should only apply where an officer is guilty of misconduct, is placed on half-pay at his own request, declines to accept an appointment, or is incapacitated by illness due to his own default. In addition, there will be instances where the period of full-pay sick leave (twelve months in normal cases) is exceeded before the officer is invalided or is fit to return to active service. In such circumstances he should be placed on halfcpay for the interval. The rates should remain as at present, except that for all officers there should be a minimum rate of 5s. a day.EDWARD CARSON, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., January 22, 1918.o
