[This Bocmiientjs^e^ropertyjsf His^Brg^nic^jjajsstys j*OT^rJE^jJPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.SECRET.G.-173.PACIFIST  PROPAGANDA.Note by Sir George Cave and Draft Regulations.(Previous Papers Nos. G. 157 and War Cabinet 253, Minute 1.)I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet a report by the Assistant Commissioner of Police on Pacifist and Revolutionary Organizations in the United Kingdom.   (Appendix.)As regards support given to these organizations by German money the report is inconclusive; and since its receipt I have been in consultation with Mr. Basil Thomson and others with a view to further investigations being made. It has now been arranged that the books and documents of these organizations shall be examined, and the source of their income traced home if possible, and that for this purpose there shall be closer co-operation between Scotland Yard and the Military Intelligence Department. I hope that before long further information may be available.The question of taking more drastic powers to deal with the growing propaganda in favour of an immediate peace on terms favourable to Germany is (I think) a pressing one.So far as the propaganda takes the form of meetings and speeches, it is in a fair way to be dealt with. There is a strong public feeling against pacifist meet-ings; and these meetings, when not prohibited in order to prevent a breach of the peace, are usually unsuccessful. The loyal meetings recently held in South Wales and addressed by General Smuts, Mr. Brace, and others, have had an excellent effect; and I think that every pacifist gathering should be brought to the attention of the War Aims Committee or the British Workers League, in order that they may (if thought desirable) organize a loyal meeting to follow it. Prosecutions for seditious speeches are seldom advisable.To deal effectively with pacifist literature is more difficult, and I think that further powers are required.At the present time a very large number of pacifist pamphlets and leaflets are in circulation, the expense being borne out of funds supplied either by the enemy or by anarchists or peace cranks in this country. To censor these leaflets would not be an interference with freedom of opinion and speech; for they are not expressions of opinion, but propaganda intended to influence others. It is difficult effectively to seize them, as they do not come to the knowledge of the authorities until they have been distributed, and prosecution, even if successful, would not be of much value. I think that it is desirable to make a new regulation under the Defence of the Realm Acts, requiring all leaflets, pamphlets, and circulars dealing with questions of war or peace to bear the names and addresses of the author and printer, and to be passed by the Press Bureau before publication.Newspapers may be divided into two classes: (1.) Papers with a small circulation, issued for the purposes of propaganda only, such as the &quot; Call,&quot; the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; the &quot; Tribunal,&quot; &amp;c. When these papers offend against the regulations we can seize the current issue and the plant-under D.R.R. 51; and this process, which costs the publishers something, is fairly effective. But money is always found to resume the issue of the paper.(2.) Papers with a large circulation, such as the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; the &quot;Herald,&quot; the &quot;Clarion,&quot; &amp;c. These papers are mischievous; but to seize these publications and the plant would interfere with the publica-tion of other matter by the same printers, and might attract the sympathy of the more reputable newspapers. A proposal to seize the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; was some time ago brought before the War Cabinet, but was negatived.[1168] &apos; B
I am disposed to think that power should be taken to suspend the issue of any paper which offends against the Defence of the Realm Regulations, i.e., that the Secretary of State should be empowered on such an offence being committed to direct that the offending publication be not issued for a time to be specified, or until further order. In order to prevent objection by the press generally, it might be arranged that the Secretary of State shall not exercise this power without first consulting an Advisory Committee to be ajjpointed by him, and to contain not less than two representatives of the press. It appears to me that the mere existence of such a power would be a strong deterrent in the case of all newspapers with a good circulation.Sir Archibald Bodkin, whose experience in these matters is very great, has been good enough to offer his services for the purpose of perusing the questionable newspapers and other publications, and advising as to seizure, prosecution, &amp;c, and I have gladly accepted his offer. I propose to put Sir Archibald Bodkin as representing the Home Office into close communication with Colonel Kell (M.I. 5) and Mr. Basil Thomson (Scotland Yard) for the purpose of dealing with these matters.I annex a draft of the new regulations proposed, and ask for the decision of the &quot;War Cabinet upon them.(Signed)    G. CAVE.Home Office,November 13, 1917.Draft Regulations.After regulation 27aa the following regulation shall be inserted : It shall not be lawful for any person to print or publish any leaflet dealing with the continuance of the war or the conclusion of peace unless (a.) there is printed on every copy of the leaflet the name and address of theauthor and of the printer; (b.) the contents thereof have previously been submitted to and approved bythe Directors of the Official Press Bureau;and if any person contravenes the foregoing provisions he shall be guilty of a summary offence against these regulations, and if any person without lawful authority or excuse has in his possession or on premises in his occupation or under his control any leaflet the publication of which would be a contravention of the foregoing provisions of this regulation, he shall be guilty of a summary offence against these regulations, unless he proves that he did not know and had no reason to suspect that the leaflet dealt with such matters as aforesaid, or that he had no intention of transmitting or circulating the document or distributing copies thereof to or amongst other persons.For the purposes of this regulation &quot; leaflet&quot; includes a pamphlet or circular, but does not include a newspaper or other periodical.After regulation 51a the following regulation shall be inserted : When a Secretary of State is satisfied that any report or statement in contravention of regulation 27 or regulation 27a has appeared in any newspaper or other periodical he may by order prohibit, either absolutely or except subject to such conditions as may be specified in the order, the publication of any future issues of the newspaper or periodical &quot;for such time as may be specified in the order or until further order.If any person contravenes any order made under this regulation or fails :fi to comply with any condition imposed thereby he shall be guilty of an offence against these regulations.In the application of this regulation to Scotland references to the Secretary for Scotland shall be substituted for references to the Secretary of State.
APPENDIX.Pacifist and Revolutionary Organisations in the United Kingdom. (Report by the Assistant Commissioner of Police.)THE principal facts about what is called &quot;the peaceful penetration of Germany&quot; before the war fire well known. Beginning with the establishment of the Deutsche Bank in 1869, no less than six important German banking concerns were established under the partial control of the German Government. Side by side with these concerns went numerous German trade corporations ; German clubs, schools, and. churches were established, and a branch even of the German Navy League held meetings in London and some of the northern ports. All these institutions had the paramount duty of fostering German influence.Among the authors of books published in the German interest before the war two stand pre-eminent. Mr. Lane, who writes under the name of Norman Angell, published in 1909 &quot;Europe&apos;s Optical Illusion,&quot; which was followed in 1910 by &quot;The Great Illusion.&quot; This latter work appeared in England, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Holland, Italy, Russia, Japan, and China, and it was also translated into Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, Marathi, and Tamil. The cost of publication is said to have been financed by Baron de Forest, the heir to Baron Hirsch, the Austrian banker. Mr. E. D. Morel, whose real name is de Ville, and who is still recognised by the French as a French citizen, though naturalised in England, published books and pamphlets on abuses in the Congo, which were undoubtedly in the German interest, as bringing the Belgian Government into public odium. There is no proof that he received money from German sources, but this has been stated publicly on several occasions, and he has never thought fit to vindicate himself. The probabilities are certainly strong that Mr. Morel did not work out of pure altruism. He began life as a clerk in .the firm of Jones, the West African shipowners, and after a time he quarrelled with the firm and transferred to their rivals, the Holt Line. It is said that he received a legacy producing 100L a year from the firm when he severed his connection with it. Since cnat time he has made his living with his pen, and as his activities have certainly been in the German interests as well as those of his friend, Sir Roger Casement, in his latter years, the public cannot be blamed for believing that Mr. Morel has been financed by Germany in the past, and ma,j possibly be expecting financial reward for his peace activities in the future.When we turn to the humbler German agents before the war, we are on surer ground. Baron Louis von Horst, the son of a small grocer in Prussia, who was ennobled by the late Duke of Saxe-Coburg, came to this country some years ago as a poor man, and set up a business as a hop dealer at 26, Denman Street, S.E. His means were known to be small, but in 1912 he entered into a correspondence with Ben Tillett at the time of the transport workers&apos; strike, and is understood to have given free meals to the strikers&apos; children, and to have attended their meetings on Tower Hill. In August 1912 he came forward with a proposal to subsidise &quot;The Daily Herald,&quot; the Socialist organ, to the extent of 1,000L In 1913 he was found to be associated with the suffragette movement, and he bailed out Mrs. Flora Drummond after one of the numerous police court proceedings, tie also subscribed to the W.S.P.U. funds. In 1914 he turned his attention to Ireland, nominally to foster hop-growing in that country. He was then associated with a dangerous American woman called Troy. At the time of the transport workers&apos; strike he visited Dublin and fraternised with Jim Larking. He then appeared in the guise of r- Nationalist, and made enquiries of a London gunmaker as to the cost of 500 Mauso rifles and ammunition. During the first f uim ^ar ^orst had the effroritery to visit the Home Office with a proposal to establish a Committee for the Relief of Distressed Germans. He was, however, immediately interned.It is practically certain that Horst did not stand alone German &quot; agentprovocateur^ but as all the Germans against whom the authorities had suspicions were short116       ng      firSt WGeks 0f the War&apos; &apos;lt is Probable that their activities were cut
Principal Pacifist and Revolutionary Organisations.The following are the pacifist and revolutionary organisations in order of importance : PacifistsUnion of Democratic Control (U.D.C.). Independent Labour Party (I.L.P.). &apos;    British Socialist Party (B.S.P.).No-Conscription Fellowship (N.C.F.). The Herald League.Womens International League (W.I.L.). Women&apos;s Peace Crusade. Peace Negotiations Committee.Revolutionary.Shop Stewards and Amalgamation Committee (otherwise known as the Rankand File Movement). Industrial Workers of the World. Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council. (The Plerald League is also revolutionary.)Immediately after the outbreak of war, the Union of Democratic Control and the Independent Labour party were the two pacifist organisations. They took the line that this country ought to have left the Continental nations to fight out their quarrel. In 1915, when the question of conscription was first mooted, the No-Conscription Fellowship sprang into existence, and shortly afterwards a number of the smaller organisations mentioned above. The British Socialist party was also pacifist, but in the early stages of the war it was badly off for funds, and it was only when the Independent Labour party came to its assistance that it was able to hold important meetings. The Herald League was founded by Mr. George Lansbury in the spring of 1912, when the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; was first, published.Of the revolutionary societies, the Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.) is the oldest. It was extinguished entirely in this country for some months in 1915-1916, but it has lately been resuscitated, without, however, much vitality. The Shop Stewards Committee was a very serious factor early in 1917. It arose out of the old Clyde Workers Committee, which had caused the strike in Glasgow in 1915. As a body, it is not against the prosecution of the war, but is solely for improving the conditions of its members, without regard to national considerations.With the exception of the Independent Labour party, the pacifist bodies have been financially in low water for some time. The Independent Labour party claims to have 800 branches, (50,000 members, a strong parliamentary connection, and many legitimate sources of income apart from the sale of its literature. The members of several Trades Unions to wdiich the party is affiliated are believed to pay a lev)T of Id. a month towards the party&apos;s funds, and the literature sold through the other peace organisations is said to return more than 50 per cent, profit to the party. Pacifism is no part of the published objects of the Independent Labour party, which are : -1. To secure the collective ownership of all means of production, distribution, and exchanp-e:2. Independent Labour representation on all legislative and administrative bodies ;but from the outset of the war it opposed the Socialist Labour party, and refused to associate itself with recruiting campaigns. It vehemently denounced conscription, and urged peace by negotiation. It has been working most assiduously in South Wales for the past two or three years with very mischievous results. At the end of 1916 it was less in the public eye for a time ; but the Russian Revolution gave it a fresh lease of life, and with the assistance of the British Socialist party, who were being financed from the Independent Labour party&apos;s funds, a meeting was held at Leeds on the 3rd June, 1917, from which sprang the Council of Workers&apos;and Soldiers&apos;Delegates. A message of congratulation was sent to the Russian Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Council, and steps were taken to recruit members from the Army and Navy, and to form thirteen branches in different parts of the country. The Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Council was never in a strong financial position ; what money it possessed was collected at public
meetings, and subscribed by affiliated societies. It found little or no support in the army, and it is now moribund.Union of Democratic Control.The Union of Democratic Control has been, more before the public eye than the other pacifist bodies, partly on account of the position of Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, Mr. Arthur Ponsonby, Mr. Charles Trevelyan, and Mr. Jowett, and partly because of the notoriety of Mr. E. D. Morel. It is not a revolutionary body, and it has been appealing, at any rate in the early days of the war, more to the intellectual classes than to the working-class. It was founded shortly after the declaration of war with the object of securiug a new course of diplomatic policy under the following five points: 1. No province shall be transferred from one Government to another without the consent of a plebiscite or otherwise of the populations of such provinces.2. No treaty, arrangement, or undertaking shall be entered upon in the name of Great Britain without the sanction of Parliament.3. Adequate machinery for ensuring democratic control of foreign policy of Great Britain shall not be aimed at creating alliances for the purpose of maintaining the balance of power, but shall be directed to concerted action between the Powers- and the setting up of an international council whose deliberations and decisions shall be public. That such machinery for securing inter-national agreement shall be created as shall be a guarantee of an abiding peace.4. Great Britain shall propose as part of the peace settlement&apos; a plan for a drastic reduction by consent of the armaments of all the belligerent Powers, and to facilitate that policy shall attempt to secure the general nationalisation of the manufacture of armaments, and the control of the export of armaments by one country to another.5. The European conflict shall not be continued by an economic war after the military operations have ceased. British policy shall be directed towards promoting free commercial intercourse between all nations and the preservation and extension of the principle of the open door.Its office is at 37, Norfolk Street, and, beyond the cost of printing, its expenses are not very large. The Society of Friends and Messrs. Cadbury, Fry, and Rnwntree have all subscribed fairly liberally to its funds. Under the guidance of Mr. Morel it has gone far beyond its original intentions. During the labour unrest in the spring we received information that Mr. Morel was distributing leaflets and pamphlets among the workmen in Sheffield, and his activities have been mischievous in relation to foreign correspondents, though it is difficult to get definite evidence as to what he has been doing. Though he may not now be in receipt of German money, there can be little doubt that there is a good understanding between him and a number of prominent Germans as to his activities during the war. His conviction has, for a time, been a set back to the Society.To support this fact, Mr. Morel has never replied to.any of the public accusations that he is a German agent.British Socialist Party.The British Socialist party was founded in March 1881 by Mr. H. M. Hyndman and others under the name of the Social Democratic party. In 1911 this party united with several minor socialistic organisations to form a new body entitled the British Socialist party. The Fifth Annual Conference of the organisation was held at Manchester at Easter 1916, when, amon^ other resolutions, the following was passed:- &amp;&quot; That the manhood of the country should not be sacrificed to the ambitious schemes of the militarists and imperialists, who regarded human lives as mere pawns in the game of war.&quot;This led to a split.   Hyndman and several others broke off and formed a separate orgamsatian m support of the war.   The peace section, led by E. C. Fairehild, editor of tne   Oall,   continued under the title of the British Socialist party, and issued an ppeal urging public meetings, demonstrations, propaganda among workers, international [H68J &quot; ^ &quot; c
action, co-operation with the International Socialist Commission, Berne, and simul-taneous and co-ordinate action with the minorities in all belligerent countries in pursuit of peace.The British Socialist party is very noisy, but it does not carry very much weight. It is in such low water financially that the Independent Labour party has had to come to its support.No-Conscription Fellowship.The No-Conscription Fellowship, with which is now incorporated the National Council for Civil Liberties, was founded to combat conscription. In its early stages it employed a number of long-haired young men of the type of the Wycliffe Preachers, and a good many women belonged to it. Its promoters say that they believe in human brotherhood and the sanctity of human life, and the organisation contains undoubtedly many genuine conscientious objectors, besides a very large number of men and women who would join any society which was opposed to the views of the majority. Consequently, there is a strong revolutionary spirit to be found in some of the speeches of its members. In the beginning the Fellowship undertook to support the dependants of conscientious objectors, but latterly, owing to lack of funds, it has been quite unable to meet this obligation. It has a good deal of support from the Society of Friends and from the Independent Labour party. It publishes &quot; The Tribunal,&quot; a weekly paper recently raided by the police.The Herald League.The Herald League, founded by Mr. George Lansbury, is grouped about the newspaper &quot; Herald,&quot; and is connected with the Independent Labour party through its founder. It is not an organisation engaged in circulating secret propaganda, but it devotes itself to providing speakers for meetings in open spaces in the evenings and on Sundays. It generally provokes a great deal of heckling, and sometimes disorder, owing to the violent pacifist and revolutionary speeches made by its members. Latterly observation has shown that the audiences are more indulgent, and that Australian soldiers who come to disturb the meetings end by listening attentively. Mr. Lansbury recently stated that the League had increased 75 per cent, in the last twelve months. The Rev. F. Swan, of the Brotherhood Church in Southgate Road, speaks both for the Herald League and for the No-Conscription Fellowship.Women&apos;&apos;s International League and Women&apos;s Peace Crusade.The Women&apos;s International League for Permanent Peace is a branch of the International Committee of Women whose headquarters are at 467, Keizergracht, Amsterdam. It is closely allied with the Women&apos;s Peace Crusade, which has branches throughout the country. Both are governed by the same committee of feminine peace cranks of the type of Mrs. Swan wick (a woman of German origin) and Mrs. Pethwick Lawrence. They are believed to draw their financial support from the -Quakers, and the Peace Crusade is said to be financed to some extent by Councillor Margaret Ashton, M.A., of Withington, Manchester, and Miss M. V. Hoffman, of Bowdon, Cheshire. The latter is a woman of pro-German sympathy, born in Cologne, of an English father and a German-born mother. The father, now dead, was a cotton mill-owner in Lancashire.The object of the Womens International League is: &quot; To establish the principles of right rather than might, and of co-operation rather than conflict in national and international affairs, and for this purpose to work for a development of the ideals underlying modern democracy in the interests of constructive peace.&quot;The opposition of conscription, whether military or industrial.&quot; The emancipation of women and the protection of their interests.&quot;The activities of the two societies are confined principally to London, Manchester, and Glasgow. Their meetings in London and Manchester were broken up in September.Peace Negotiations Committee.This is another of Mrs. Swanwick&apos;s activities. The society aims at no indemnities, no annexations, and opposition to Military Service. The society is of no great importance, but investigations are being made as to the source of its funds.
Shop Stewards and Amalgamation Committee.The constitutional objects of this Committee are pretty well known. Outwardly it is a syndicalist movement for acquiring control of industry for the workers, but it is in reality a movement of revolt on the part of the younger and ambitious trade unionists against their more sober officials. They want some of the limelight for themselves, and they chafe at the difficulty in persuading their unions to take direct action. Many of the promoters of the movement are the driving force in the Shipbuildiug, Metal, and Engineering Amalgamation Committee. The object is to create one union in the engineering trade by amalgamating all sections, skilled and unskilled. The movement attracted to it most of the rebels of the engineering trade who had achieved notoriety in Glasgow, such as Arthur McManus, David Kirkwood, Peet, and Kealey of Manchester, and Cassidy and Dingley of Coventry, and Watson of London. These men were responsible for the great engineers&apos; strike of May 1917, in defiance of the executive of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. Working through the shop stewards in every industry they were able to bring the men out by a series of secret orders transmitted by motor cycles, as they were afraid of the correspondence being tapped. The Committees in each place are self-supporting. When expenses have been incurred, the members subscribe equally amongst themselves enough to cover the outlaw The Independent Labour party and the Union of Democratic Control are supposed to have given financial assistance to the movement, but this has not been verified. In any case the Co mmittees are generally in low water, and the Manchester Committee for one was plunged into debt. An -attempt is- now being made to direct the movement into useful channels, and it is significant that, at a meeting two weeks ago, the proposals of the extremists to form a new union in competition with the old was divided by a large majority.The Shop Stewards generally are in favour of continuing the war.Industrial Workers of the World.The headquarters of the Industrial Workers of the World are in Chicago. The organisation was founded in 1905, and it has made itself important in the United States on account of its militancy rather than the number of its members. As in the case of other revolutionary movements, its object is to overthrow all capitalism, but most of the members do not get beyond the notion that sabotage, terrorism, and murder is all they have to think about. Crimes of this description have been brought home to the Industrial Workers of the World, both in Australia and in America.The Industrial Workers of the World in England is not organically connected with the societies in America and Australia. Before the war the membership in London was small but growing; it had a headquarters, and its most active member was a telegraphist in the General Post Office, who was advocating sabotage among the telegraphic machines when the Post Office employees were restless. In 1916, when he was called up for the army, the office was closed, and the society underwent temporary eclipse. Its membership had never been very large, nor its activities great. In 1917, however, an attempt was made to resuscitate it. The East End Jews, who are now connected with it, have made an attempt to republish their monthly journal, &quot; &apos;\ ne Industrial Worker,&quot; which is being run at a loss. The only income the society has is the subscription of its members, and a certain number of young men of military age in the engineering, mining, and other trades who have not been called up for military service belong to it.Though the Industrial Workers of the World has practically no funds at present, and the membership is insignificant, it must not be dismissed as negligible, as at an)&apos;-time the advent of an Australian or an American member may infuse new life into it.WorkmeWs and Soldiers Councils.This body was founded after the meeting at Leeds on the 3rd June, 1917, following on the Russian Revolution.   As stated on page 5, it has now practically ceased to exist.The Army and Navy.A few months ago some of the men in the ordnance shops on the lines of commu-nication in France were found to be taking in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot; Herald,&quot; and there was some anxiety as to how far the propaganda had gone.   It was found on [1168] D
enquiry that the men were solid for the prosecution of the war, and that most of the revolutionary talk had been confined to plans for after the war. Traces of the same thing were found among the Army Service Corps and one of the Cavalry Divisions, but it is probably correct to say that it was only found where the local Commanding Officer had made inadequate provision for recreation or was oat of touch with his men; this is said now to have been corrected. Though there is some grumbling in the army and dissatisfaction in the navy, as described in the attached report, it may be said that pacifist propaganda has had little or no success with the men now serving. It may develop as the winter goes on, but in any case in this respect we shall have had twelve months advantage of the enemy.General.So far no evidence has come to light suggesting that any of the pacifist societies are directly in receipt of enemy funds. It would be possible to arrange for a scrutiny of their accounts by a chartered accountant, acting under the police, with a warrant from the competent military authority; but against this there is the consideration that at present these societies are much mistrusted by the public, and the result of an abortive scrutiny would be that their speakers would always quote it against persons who heckled them at meetings as a proof that they were free from suspicion of enemy influence. The public view of these societies is at present healthy, and though the\T gain recruits from people who are war-weary, the great majority of Englishmen regard them with deep suspicion.There is no doubt that some of the most active supporters of pacifist and rebel propaganda are to be found amongst young men of military age in the engineering, mining, and other trades who have not been called up for military service owing to the national needs at home. These men miss the relaxations to which they were accustomed before the war, owing to the curtailment of horse-racing, football, and other amuse-ments, and to the reduction of hours when public-houses&apos; are kept open. At the same time their pockets are full of money. Some of the spare time which, in other circum-stances, would have been devoted to amusements of various kinds, is now given to attending meetings, where they lend a ready ear to the agitator, and anything that can be done to provide them with more amusements and so to keep them away from meetings held by agitators would have a salutary effect.It has been suggested that an issue of premium bonds would satisfy some of their craving for excitement; and in so far as it is practicable, everything should be done to cater for the reasonable demand of the working classes for relaxation and amusement, so as to relieve their lives of the burden of melancholy dulness which impels so many to take up agitation as a pastime.Discontent in the Army and Navy.It has come to my knowledge that among the men on leave from the Front and from Home Commands who frequent the Union Jack Club, there is a great deal of talk about the alleged preferential treatment of persons like Mr. Lazlo and Mr. Morel, as compared with the treatment that would be meted out to a soldier or civilian in the humbler walks of life for offences against the safety of the realm. There is also much discontent at the grant of temporary commissions granted to persons like Mr. George Grossmith and others who have not been through the ranks. These grumbles come more from the naval ratings than from soldiers. I believe, however, that all the-men are perfectly sound about the prosecution of the war. The feeling of dissatisfaction, however, is being worked upon by agitators in the ranks, and there is therefore some reason for anxiety on this account.The naval discontent is centred round the Lower Deck Society of the Eoyal Navy. This society was founded in 1912, but no general meeting has been held at any time during the war. In July 1917 a General Committee was formed, representing every rank below warrant rank in the Navy. The Committee has appointed twelve Joint Committeemen at certain ports, who in turn have elected nine delegates. tThe whole of the delegates met as late as the 11th October, 1917.The duty of the delegates appears to be to read the Committees report and revise or amend it, and finally to send it to Lord Beresford, who is said to be greatly interested in the movement. It is said that Lord Beresford is shortly to be.presented in London with an illuminated address and loving cup, as an appreciation of his interest in the society.
The Committee claims to have obtained the support of the editor of the &quot; Times &quot; and of Mr. Yexley, editor of the &quot;Fleet.&quot; The latter contributes frequent articles to the &quot; Hampshire Gazette,&quot; but he is not very popular with the Committee.The grievances are : I. That the proposed rise of pay, &amp;c, is to be only temporary.2. The introduction of persons, through social influence, to executive officer ranksin the service.  They say that Mr. Seymour Hicks, the actor, has been giventhe rank of lieutenant, R.N.V.R., which is bitterly resented by all ratings.They have evidently mistaken Mr. Hicks for Mr. George Grossmith, Jun. 3. The incompetence of civilians recently given officer rank, by which three or fourmotor launches have been blown up and the lives of their crew endangeredby bad handling.4. The impending court-martial of a master-at-arms on H.M.S. &quot; Resolution &quot; for his connection with the Lower Deck Society. The sum of 150Z. has already been subscribed to his defence, of which 50L has been received from members of the society serving on the &quot; Resolution.&quot; Messrs. Bond and Pierce, solicitors, have been engaged for the defence, and a reporter has been engaged to give full publicity to the proceedings. It is believed that, in the event of the punishment of the master-at-arms, there will be great discontent in the Grand Fleet, and possibly a mutiny on the &quot; Resolution.&quot; I am told that Lord Beresford has been apprised of the pending court-martial, and asked to intervene.The society is financially strong and has the backing of all organised Trades Union delegates in the country.There is considerable discontent, and the men say that nothing but the full concession of their demands will appease them.(Signed)        BASIL THOMSON.New Scotland Yard,
