-   175[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for ihe War Cabinet.   January 1918.SECRET. - ,      rag a        (.r)G.-186. 7THE POSITION OF THE NORTHERN NEUTKAL COUNTRIES.Holland.(Previous Papers Nos. G.-153 and G.-184.)IN accordance with the instructions laid down in War Cabinet 294, Minute 23, the Northern Neutrals Committee have considered the position of Holland with reference to the Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty, dated the 3rd December, 1917 (G.T.-2847).The Committee have ascertained from the Military Attache at The Hague that the statement that troops had been sent to Walcheren and civilians expelled from the island owing to fear of British troops being sent there, is not altogether correct. The troops were sent there in connection with the defence of the island (some have since been withdrawn), and apparently the Dutch are anxious to have our help in the event of a German attack on the island,It appears that, acting on instructions from General sSmuts, the Military Attache&apos; (Lieutenant-Colonel Oppenheim) has had several conversations with the Dutch Com-mander-in-chief and officers on the General Staff in Holland, and though, at the start, the Dutch military authorities were not inclined to discuss the question of our co-operation on the ground that such would Be a breach of neutrality, ultimately Lieu tenant-Colonel Oppenheim succeeded in persuading them that our co-operation was essential if Walcheren was to be protected against a German attack.As a guarantee of our good faith in this matter the Dutch military authorities asked that the British Government would supply them with the following munitions: (A.)4 heavy coast batteries of at least 35 cm., guns and ammunition. 32-15 cm. howitzers with 50,000 H.E. shells. 50,000 gas shells. 50,000 G.R.T.32 &quot;long&quot; 10 cm. guns with ammunition.(B.)100,000 box respirators.16 cable balloons and apparatus. 20 large searchlights. 40 small searchlights. 1,000 Very pistols with rockets and lights. 1,000,000 hand grenades.As regards the guns, &amp;c, under &quot; A,&quot; the Committee, in view of the demand for guns for the protection of the mercantile marine, and our needs on the Western front, &amp;c, are of opinion that the demand cannot be met at present, and that it should be an easy matter to satisfy Dutch opinion on this point.In connection with the general requirements shown under &quot; B,&quot; the Committee are of opinion that with the exception of the searchlights, of which the navy has need, the request of the Dutch can generally be complied with.[121]
The Committee make the following recommendations : (1.&quot;) That a German attack on Walcheren, in view of the existing situation inFlanders, &amp;c, is very unlikely. (2.) That if an attack is made in the future, it is vital, in the interests of theAllies, that Walcheren should be held by the Dutch, which can only bedone if British co-operation is immediately forthcoming. (3.) That with a view to such co-operation being practicable, it is very desirablethat negotiations should continne, so that all details can be arranged inadvance.(4.) That to enable further negotiations to takelplace, it is essential that such munitions as can he reasonably spared and are necessary for the defence of Walcheren against the Germans be supplied immediately to the Dutch Government, and that they be informed that, if danger to Walcheren threatens from Germany, the British Government will at once take the necessary steps to supply them with sufficient guns and ammunition, as well as a mixed force, to enable them to resist the German attack.E.
