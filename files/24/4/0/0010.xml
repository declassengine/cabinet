[This Document is the Property: of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]33Printed for the War Cabinet.   October1917.SECRET.G.-160.ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.(Previous Papers Nos. G.-156, C1.-158, and G.-159.)IN connection with the important questions raised in Sir Edward Carsons memo-: randum on Economic Offensive (G.-1561, it may perhaps be useful to furnish the War! Cabinet with certain supplementary information.The question of our requirements and possible supplies of materials for industry after the war was the first question to which I devoted attention on undertaking my present dutiesThe interim report of Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee drew attention to certain commodities of which there might be shortages or of which we and our Allies might possibly be able to secure a substantial measure of control, and a great mass of valuable information has been accumulated by different Departments. This informatiou, however, had not been got together in a collected form, and clearly required supplementing in certain directions After consultation, therefore, with Sir Albert Stanley, Lord Robert Cecil, and other colleagues, I have arranged to appoint a Materials Supply Committee, with the following terms of reference : To consider and report upon 1. The extent of the supplies of raw materials wrhich in their opinion will be required by British manufacturers for the purpose of restoring and developing trade during the period which will elapse between the termina-tion of the war and the restoration of a normal condition of trade.2. The extent to which such supplies of materials might be obtained from the United Kingdom or within the empire, or from Allied or neutral countries, and to make recommendations for the purpose of securing and allocating any such supplies which might not be available in sufficient quantities and at reasonable prices through the ordinary commercial channels.For this work I have secured the services of Sir Charles Fielding. Sir Clarendon Hyde.Mr. Cecil Budd (with the concurrence of the Ministry of Munitions). Sir Henry Birchenough.Sir Henry Babington Smith (with the concurrence of the President of the Board ofTrade). Mr. Wallace Thorneycroft.Mr. Andrew Weir (with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War).This Committee will collect together, either through individuals or through sub-committees and consulting with the different trades concerned, information on different branches of subjects, such as non-ferrous metals, textile materials, building materials, &amp;c.,and arrangements are already well advanced in some directions for these purposes. The information can then be brought together in a collected form, and the related questions of finance and tonnage presented therewith. We should thereby obtain very shortly a presentation of our own requirements with that of the available possible supplies outside enemy countries. [10511
I would suggest, as a step preliminary to the Conference suggested by Sir Edward Carson in his memorandum at the foot of p. 3, that our Allies should be asked to take similar steps if they have not already done so. When we know our own requirements we shall then be in a position to discuss questions of allocation and tonnage betweenourselves and our Allies.in examining this subject it also became apparent that, in a large number of different Departments, valuable information had been accumulated as to the economic requirements and efforts of the enemy, but no agency was provided for the information being brought together in a collected form available for those charged with the responsibility of dealing with these matters. It is also obvious that in this matter it is impossible to separate questions of a possible economic offensive from those of industrial requirements. I therefore called a conference of the different Departments which possessed or had collected this information, and I found them to consist of the following :  The War Cabinet Secretariat,The Treasury,The Colonial Office,The Admiralty,The War Office,The Board of Trade,The War Trade Intelligence Department, and The Department of Information.After conference with my colleagues, with a view to brin^m^- all this information into a compact form, I have appointed a Committee, under Sir Arthur Steel Maitland as chairman, consisting of representatives of: The Admiralty, The Board of Trade,The Foreign Office (War Trade Intelligence Department), The Ministry of Reconstruction,with the following terms of reference : To bring together and classify the available information bearing on economic conditions in enemy, Allied, and neutral countries, with special reference (a) to commercial and financial questions likely to arise in connection with peace negotiations, and (6) to the furnishing of such information as may be required by the Minister of Iveconstruction for the assistance of the Raw Material or other Committees set up by him.This will, in some measure, help to meet the need suggested in paragraph (2) at the top of p. 3 of Sir Edward Carson&apos;s memorandum.Our final requirements of materials necessarily involve an examination of the demands upon our industries already formulated or likely to be forthcoming for different classes of work, and this again must affect, in some measure, the order of demobilisation of the Forces. I am not altogether, therefore, quite satisfied that the proposal in the final paragraph of the memorandum on the top of p. 4 can fully meet the requirements of the case, but it will be doubtless considered when the Cabinet discusses the question as a whole.(Initialled)      C. A.Ministrij of Reconstruction, September 28, 1917.o
