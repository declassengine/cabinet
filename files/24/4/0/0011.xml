[This Document is the Property: of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1917.SECRET.3TRADE WAR.A Rough Preliminary Note by Mr. Montagu. (Previous Papers Nos. G.-156, G.-158, G.-159, aud G.-160.)1. IT is a matter to me of profound satisfaction that the Cabinet is considering an economic offensive against the Central Powers.2. It is, believe me, in no spirit of egotism that I would venture to tell the Cabinet that I wrote to the Foreign Office on the 11th December, 1915, following a letter on the same subject to Mr. Asquith, to say, &quot; The time may come when we ought to say to Germany that if the Germans do not make peace on our terms we shall prevent them rehabilitating themselves after the war.   To be in a position to say thisat the right moment requires immense preparation.....We must now negotiatewith as many,Powers in the world as possible (presumably all our Allies, and possibly even Spain and who knows ? the United States) a treaty, under which we shall be prepared at the right moment to say to Germany that we shall issue a prohibition of German goods or a prohibitionary tariff which we have agreed to keep in effect for two years for every month Germany prolongs the war.&quot;3. I followed this up with a Memorandum to the late Cabinet in 1916, and whilst I was at the Reconstruction Committee, travelling outside our business, we made the same recommendation to the Government.4. The arguments for such a proposal seem to me very strong. The Allies require geographical and political guarantees as a result of this war. Germany requires economic guarantees far more than either of the others. Even if the peace which we eventually achieve is not one which will give us all that we should like, the power of such a treaty with our Allies as I had in mind in 1915 for threatening Germany would he invaluable in negotiation.5. Those who study the German character have always assured me that, as is to be expected from a scientific -nation, the German people like to cut their losses. It is a magnificent thing never to know when you are beaten ; it is not scientific it is too hot-blooded for that and I can conceive that those who control affairs in Germany are constantly looking to what they stand to gain and lose, what chances they have of rebuilding. Ever since the. Paris Conference resolutions were published, the German people have been told in numerous newspapers and speeches that they are fighting to maintain their economic principles. If it were now made clear to them, not by a brutimi fidmen, but by a solemn treaty, that the longer they fought the more certain they were to lose their economic freedom, I can imagine that they would increase so far as was possible their military activities, from which I presume we have nothing to fear, and then when this failed they would sit down to realise as the days and weeks passed that the longer they fought the more certain would be their ruin.6. As time has gone on the entry of new Powers into the fight on our side, until practically the whole world is included, makes a treaty of this kind far more possible than it was before the&quot;&apos;continent of America, for instance, came into the war, and far more likely to be effective.7. It is noteworthy that Protectionists and Free Traders alike in this country are willing and anxious to see this policy adopted, and I conceive it to be of the highest importance that a conference of the Allies should be summoned at once with a view to the conclusion of such a treaty.8. I hope that the consideration would not merely be a consideration of refusing-to buy from our enemies if they do not make a satisfactory peace, but a consideration of refusing to sell them their necessary raw materials, of breaking post-war contracts, of denying them access to our ports, of refusing them coaling facilities throughout the world.[1063]
Paris Conference.9. The consideration of the policy of an economic war now makes it all the more certain that the Paris Conference resolutions ought immediately to be discarded and abandoned. They were always really framed more to make peace between Free Traders and Protectionists than for practical utility. They were always framed more to hit the enemy than for our own needs, and they have been rendered absolutely useless by the facts that the United States have come into the war, and that most of the signatory Powers have made reservations and qualifications since which would make it impossible to carry them out. They have become dangerous because most of the official activity connected with the preparation of post-war economic policy proceeds on the assumption that the Paris Conference resolutions hold. That assumption ought to be swept away, and a surer foundation for our policy, to which the United States are a party, ought to be sought.10. Enemy trade would be governed by the treaty formed for the purpose of eco-nomic war, and the new economic resolutions ought, I would submit, to be based on Allied requirements. Trade prosperity in the future will rest with those who can first get their demands for raw material and tonnage satisfied. Upon this satisfaction depends not only our trade, but the employment of our returned soldiers. I would hope that the Allies would agree to maintain State control over shipping, State control over food, State control over imports, and State control over exchange until anyhow we have returned to a proper peace footing. Otherwise we shall have a scramble for raw material and food and shipping (which are not sufficient to go round), and those who can finance their purchases quickest, even though those purchases are not of prime necessity, will usurp tonnage space.11. If this were agreed and arranged, it would follow that we ought to have inter-Ally purchasing bureaus continuing during the transition period.12. I have written these notes in great haste, for I only received this morning the War Cabinet Papers in their complete form, and I understand the discussion is coming on to-morrow ; but I would submit that a conference should immediately be summoned (1) to deliberate on the methods for carrying on an economic war; and (2) to replace the Paris resolutions ; and* that whereas we should be hastening, as 1 think, the time of peace by success in (1), we cannot make preparation for that peace without success13. A successful policy in these two matters would have another advantage. I can conceive nothing more fatal to the future of our trade, and indeed to the future of our political life, than to come again to the economic controversies of the period before the war. There would seem to be a large measure of agreement on an economic war during the war, even if it entails post-war commitments. There would seem to be substantial agreement that those who hold, as I hold, the economic faith of Free Trade must be prepared to sacrifice sound economic doctrine for considerations of defence, to maintain the key supplies in time of danger, to control national assets, although I hope that nothing will be done to foster ke\r industries which does not ensure the control of prices to the consumer and the control by the State of method in the interests of progressive development. On the other hand, there would seem to be a modification of the view of some at any rate among those who were Tariff Reformers, a reluctance to embark on a policy, apart from considerations of punishing the enemy, which would penalise our Allies, and it might well be that the Corn Production Act, together with the deliberations of Mr. Longs Committee, may settle Imperial preference mainly on other than fiscal lines.14. For these reasons, the economic war and the renewed deliberations on the topics of the Paris Conference may lead for the British Empire to the great good of a settlement, for the time at anv rate, of urgent economic problems.(Initialled) E.
