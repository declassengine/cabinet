Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.SECRET. G.-172.SOLDIERS5 AND SAILORS&apos; PAY COMMITTEE.Second (Interim) Report.(Previous Paper, No. G.-154.)1. THE recommendations made in the First Interim Report of the Committee appointed to consider the increase in the pay of soldiers and sailors (G.-154) were referred back to the Committee for further consideration in consequence of representa-tions which were made to the Prime Minister that our recommendations, more especially in the case of the single man without family or dependants, did not establish the principle of an adequate minimum rate of pay, and that the grant of proficiency pay, which in war time cannot be&apos; made dependent upon formal tests, should be more automatic in character.We have accordingly again reviewed the whole question, and now submit certain alternative and additional detailed proposals for the Army and for the Navy.ARMY.2. In order to make our further recommendations clear, it must be explained that the soldier&apos;s pay consists generally of two elements regimental pay and a supplement, variously known in different arms as Proficiency Pay, Engineer Pay, or Corps Pay. The normal rates of pay for private soldiers are as follows : Household Cavalry Line Cavalry ITorse ArtilleryGunnerDriverField and Garrison Artillery Foot Guards Line Infantry Flying Corps LabourersMechanicsEngineersArmy Service Corps Army Medical Corps Army Veterinary Corps Army Ordnance CorpsArmy Pay Corps ..Supplemented by-d.9 2^21 1 11     11   01   0 2s. or 4s.1   21Proficiency Pay-Y   Class I, 6d. .

Corps pay is paid, generally speaking, as soon ^]   glM t0 do duty, the rates advancing with his Departmental efficiency.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] &apos;
3. One of the points most open to criticism in the above scheme of pay is the lower minimum drawn by righting men, and especially in the Infantry, in comparison with the Departmental arms. This arises from the fact that in peace time the Departmental duties are less attractive and leave the soldier less free time, a disadvantage for which, under a system of voluntary enlistment, it was necessary to compensate by 0&apos;ffermg extra pay. We consider that if anything is now to be done to raise the lowest rates of pay it is of great importance to take the opportunity of reducing the present adverse balance against the fighting man.4. If Is. 6d. a day be taken as the minimum rate to be paid to any soldier, this minimum may be applied by various methods, the estimated costs of which are shown below: An increase of 6d. a day to all arms and all ranks up to and including the Warrant Officer   ... ... ... ... ... ...   Cost  34,000,000(This includes about  750,000 for 6s. motor-drivers, Flying Corps mechanics, and other men already paid very high rates.)(B.).An overriding minimum of Is. 6d. applied to regimental pay only with consequential increases for Lance-Corporals from Is. 3d. to Is. 9d. and Corporals from Is. 8d. to 2s. In view of the increases proposed for Petty Officers and Chief Petty Officers in the Naval scheme (see below), the increases in the Army cannot be confined to the overriding minimum and its strictly necessary consequences, but an increase of 3d. must be given to all higher ranks, including Warrant Officers, at a cost of  2,000,000 ...Total cost  28,000,000, mAn overriding minimum of Is. 6d. applied to Engineer pay and Corps pay as well as to regimental pay, but not to proficiency pay. Increases to N.C.Os. as under (B) ... ... ... ... ...   Cost  24,000,000(D.)An overriding minimum of Is. 6d. as under (C), but covering also proficiency pay. Increases to N.C.Os.-as under (B)     ... ... ...     Cost  8,000,000(E.)An overriding minimum of ] s. 6d. as at (C), but covering only Class II proficiencypay-Increases to N.C.Os. and Warrant Officers of Cavalry, Artillery, and Infantry asunder (B); for other Arms, no increases above rank of Corporal.Taking into account the Id. already approved for each year of war service, andbearing in mind that proficiency pay has hitherto been given only after twoyears&apos; service, the actual changes in the pay of the Infantry would be : All men now in receipt of Is.      would get a minimum of Is. 6d. ,, ,, Is. 3d. ,, ,, Is. 8d.,, Is. 6d. ,, ,, Is. lid.All men qualifying in future for Class I would get Is. 9d., Is. 10d., Is. lid.- or 2s., according as they have served 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years r &quot; - Cost,  13,500,000.- Departmental Arms. Under schemes (C) to (E), men whose present pay and Corps pay amount to Is. 5d. would get Is. 6d., those now receiving Is. 6d. or over would remain unchanged, except as regards the extra Id. for each year&apos;s war service. &quot;5. As regards these schemes it may be pointed out that the most, costly, (A), does - nothing to redress the inequality referred.to in paragraph 3, while (B), the next most costly, redresses it only to a slight extent.   Scheme (C) would be so much to the relative disadvantage of the men drawing Corps pay that it might provoke a further
reaction in their favour. On the other hand, scheme (D) would go too far in the direction of nullifying the concession already made as regards proficiency pay.6. The Committee has fully weighed, on the one hand, the large additions involved to the already heavy cost of its original recommendations, and, on the other hand, the necessity of introducing more equality into the relative treatment of the men of different arms.The Committee reminds the War Cabinet that the concessions already adopted involve an expenditure of  50,000,000 for the first year, increasing to  54,000,000 in the second year.In view of this, and of the financial commitments with which the country is and will be charged, the Committee puts scheme (E) first to the War Cabinet. This will cost for the Army and Navy, roughly, an additional  14,750,000 (the Navy proportion being about  1,250,000) ; the total concession for the first year will therefore be about  05,000,000, and for the second year about  69,000,000.On the one hand it may be argued that this scheme meets the claim for more pay for the lower ranks by withdrawing a concession already announced, namelv, proficiency pay, Class II, at 3d. a day, after six months. On the other hand, it may be argued that the scheme meets the demand for an automatic grant of the first 3d. by giving, not merely Is. 3d. at the end of six months, but Is. 6d. on enlistment, and is establishing the principle, at the same time, of an adequate minimum rate of pay for all.If it is felt that the former argument would be fatal to the cordial welcome which the soldiers and sailors should extend to these very substantial concessions of some  65,000,000 for the first year and  69,000,000 for the second year, and if it is felt that the financial conditions of the country will permit it, the Committee recommends Scheme (B). This will mean an addition of about  30,300,000 (Army  28,000,000, Navy  2,300,000), making the total of the concession  80,300,000 for the first year and  84,300,000 for the second year.NAVY.7. It is, of course, the fact that upon the representations of the deputation which waited on the Prime Minister on the 9th October the scheme of concessions to the Army and the Navy, announced by the Prime Minister, was referred back to the Committee in order broadly to see whether, if possible, something more could be done in the way of increased pay for the lowest grades of both Services.It is also the fact that the Army proposals proceed along these lines.But the Board of Admiralty are unanimously of the opinion that if it is desired to make further concessions, these should be so designed as to confer the greatest benefit on the more senior ratings.It must be remqmbered that the Army and the Navy are on a totally different footing. So far as the Army is concerned, it is desired to give something more to the lowest ranks of the fighting arms, there being, as a matter of fact, many skilled and highly paid men in the Army who are a long way from the Front and never very nearly approach it. In the Navy, practically all are in the firing line, the great majority are skilled ratings, many are very highly skilled ratings, and there cannot be the &quot;slightest doubt that the wise and expedient thing to do for the Navy is to hold out every inducement for the men most of whom make it a life&apos;s profession to advance to the higher ratings.In the Army, the private represents well over 80 per cent, of the total number of soldiers; whereas in the Navy, the ordinary seaman represents only between 11 and 12 per cent, of the personnel. Further, the ordinary seamen belonging to the permanent Royal Navy are all quite young, the average age of advance-ment to able seamen being at present below 18 years 8 months. A further difference between the two Services is that in the Navy all the permanent ratings are entered very young, and have not been accustomed to high wages before they joined, which is so very frequently the case in the Army. Further, the number of permanent ratings in the Navy, viz., 65 per cent., is incomparably greater than in the Army. Indeed, the two Services are so essentially dissimilar that no true comparison can usefully be made. The Army, as it exists to-day, is new-born ; the Navy is many centuries old, with traditions, customs, and habits which it cherishes and guards most jealously.Great difficulty is experienced in getting the most desirable men to qualify for the rating of petty officer. The increased responsibilities are very great, and the reward is not considered by them to be sufficient.
The varying rates of pay in the Navy have been arrived at after many years of experience and thought, and a process of levelling up from the more junior ratings is very undesirable, nor should the comparative incidence of the various rates of pay be altered without the most careful consideration.The Board of Admiralty are fully convinced that an increase on the lines suggested by themselves would be more highly appreciated on the lower deck than a similar amount of money expended in a flat rate of increase.8. In view of all these considerations, the following schemes of distribution represent the unanimous view of the Board of Admiralty : Scheme (E) of the War Cabinet Committee&apos;s proposals gives the Navy propor-tionally. 1,260,0001.   The proposed method of distribution is as follows : Ordinary ratings A. 13. Leading P.O. C.P.O.2d. a day. 3d.   ,, 5d.   ,, 5d.   ,,Taking the numbers borne in June as a basis	Approximate Number.

If the War Cabinet adopt Scheme (B), the Navy&apos;s share would be about  2,300,000, and the following distribution is proposed: Ordinary ratings A.B.Leading    ,,P.O.C.P.O.Taking the numbers borne in June as a basis3d. a daj&apos;. id.id. ,, Id. ,, Id.    ,,-.
