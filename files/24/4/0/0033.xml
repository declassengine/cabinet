This is the paper which I undertook to write some time ago for the War Cabinet for possible use, should the argument be approved, with those whose opinion we may desire to influence.C. of K.December 12, 1917.[1223-1]
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesfe^g Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.SECRET.g. isiTGERMAN AND TUEKISH TERRITORIES CAPTURED IN THE WAR.Their Future.THE ultimate fate of the German and Turkish territories which have been seized and are held, almost exclusively by British arms, will no doubt be deter-mined at the Peace Conference; and no definite announcement has been made prejudging the final decision. It seems desirable, however, at this stage of the war, to clear our own minds as to what that decision should in all probability be, and to marshal the arguments which may be used, whether to our Allies, to neutral States, or even to the enemy, to explain, and justify it,When the war began, there was no idea in the minds of the British public, or of the British Government, of acquiring foreign territory in any part of the globe. At that time a long war was not anticipated, except by a few; the main theatres of war were thought likely to be European, and although British sea power was at once utilised to cut off from Germany the most valuable of her colonial possessions, and as soon as Turkey had entered the wTar, to secure the British position at the head of the Persian Gulf by the capture of Basra, any thought of territorial expansion was absent, and both the German and the Turkish possessions, which have since been acquired, were regarded as in the nature of pieces on the chessboard, to be shifted about or bartered at the end of the war. A succession of British statesmen had pronounced that our Empire was already large enough, and while rectifications of frontier would undoubtedly, in the event of an Allied victory, be required here and there, mainly for the sake of security in the future, it was the map of Europe, rather than of the world, that seemed to call for reconstruction. Indeed, the only party that entered the war with a policy of territorial aggrandisement in the forefront of its programme was Germany herself, who, in her attempts to purchase the neutrality of England, disclosed that she meant, as the result of victory, to seize the colonial possessions of France. That the only Power which fought with the avowed object of annexing other nations&apos; colonies should now scream at the idea of losing any of her own, might be thought grotesque were it not so truly German.As the war has proceeded, however, different views have been forced upon the Allied belligerents as regards Germany. Not only do we now realise how formidable a danger the German colonies, notably in Africa, might have been, had they been organised and equipped for war, and how very narrowly&quot; we escaped that peril, owing to their immature development, but German Ministers of State, professors, and newspapers, have ever since openly proclaimed to the world in what manner and with what ambitions they propose to reorganise and drill the recovered German colonial dominion of the future, so that now there is not a civilised State or a thinking individual anywhere who is not aware that such a dominion will be a menace, not to the British Empire only, but to mankind. Simultaneously we have seen the Turkish Empire, infected with the virus of German militarism, formulate and proclaim pan-Turanian ambitions; which enable us to discern quite clearly the part that Turkey is to play in this war plot; while the almost incredible brutality with which she has sought to extirpate the subject races of Armenians, Syrians, and Jews, since the war began, would render it a scarcely inferior crime if these peoples were ever placed under her heel. Thus in the case both of Germany and Turkey, there has been an ever-growing revulsion of feeling, until the point has been reached of questioning, not how much it will be necessary to retain, but whether for the sake of humanity, anything can, in either case, possibly be restored.There is another point of view from which the position must be regarded, and which has only emerged into prominence as the war has gone on.  Whatever the ultimate result&quot; of the war, it is unquestionable that Germany has already, in a [1223] B
military sense, attained her Mitteleuropa ambition, and has created a solid block of German influence and Germanised territory from Hamburg to the Bosphorus. Nor does it seem likely that even if Belgium and Alsace-Lorraine (or a portion of it) be recovered, and restitution be made to Serbia and Roumania, this block will be sensibly diminished or weakened as the result of peace. On the contrary, it may be strengthened by the addition of Teutonised territories, lopped off from Russia on the East, and turned into buffer States, looking to Germany and Austria for protection and control. Now, had the Allies been able, or were they still able, to reconstruct the map of South-East Europe in the manner originally hoped for, which would have involved the frustration of German ambitions, and the break-up of the Hapsburg dominion, the situation might have been different, and it might have been possible to contemplate the restoration, both to Germany and to Turkey, of some, at any rate, perhaps the greater part, of these external possessions, which have since passed into our hands. But if the central block remains unconquered by the Allies at the end of the war, then, to allow it to thrust out its military and economic tentacles towards the Persian Gulf on the one hand, and the Suez Canal on the other, and to permit Germany to create another central block in Africa, which would for ever be pushing northwards to establish connection with the European block, would be to hand over the future of the Eastern hemisphere to the Germans, and to give her the precise spoils at which she has aimed. Viewed from this standpoint, the captured German colonies and Turkish possessions become pledges held in pawn by Great Britain on behalf of the world, to save the latter from a German domina-tion which, if thus furnished and armed at the outset, would presently become a challenge to the universe.I will now attempt to show how, and with what variations, these general arguments apply to the different areas, in which German and Turkish territories have passed by acts of war into the hands of the Allies.The Turkish Territories.I will first deal with the Turkish territories, since they fall into a group apart, and their destiny must be determined by considerations not altogether identical with those which will guide the disposition of the German colonies. The Turkish dominions which have been occupied, in whole or in part, by the Allies are: 1. Mesopotamia, which has been conquered exclusively by British and Indian troops.2. Palestine, which is being conquered by British, Colonial, and Indian troops, accompanied by small French and Italian contingents.3. Arabia, which with British support in money and arms, has thrown off its allegiance to Turkey, and has already created the independent Kingdom of the Hejaz.4. To these might have been added Armenia, had the Russian armies in the Caucasus persevered in their effort, or were they even now able to recover, or were an Armenian army to fight the battles of its country.The military situation in that part of Asia Minor is, however, too obscure for any definite forecast to be made at this juncture. But it must be borne in mind that the Allies are pledged in the most categorical manner to secure the liberation of the Armenians from the Turkish yoke, and that should that pledge be broken, not only shall we be dishonoured before the world, but the Armenians, handed back to their oppressors, will, in so far as they have not already been destroyed, disappear from the list of peoples./. Mesopotamia.This area consists of the two former Turkish vilayets of Basra and Baghdad. The former, at the head of the Persian Gulf, is essential to the security of a region where for over 100 years the Indian Government has borne the burden of suppressing piracy, policing, lighting, and buoying the waters, and main-taining the peace and freedom of the seas. After its acquisition at the end of 1914, the Viceroy^of India assured the inhabitants, who are Arabs, not Turks, that the latter would not be permitted to return. It is inconceivable that this pledge should be broken. In Baghdad, which is also an Arab, not a Turkish, town and province, the policy has been from the start to create an Arab Administration under British protection.  For nearly 100 years the main trade of Baghdad has been with India,
there has been a British Political Resident there, the navigation of the rivers and. the irrigation of the land have been carried out by English enterprise, no foreign Powers until recent years have intruded their heads, and no political influence  owing to the contiguity of the Persian Gulf and the predominance of British trade-has been comparable with that of Great Britain. Indeed, no other European Power had any direct interest or influence in Baghdad; the nearest being Russia, whose territories were separated from it by a distance of over 500 miles.Baghdad cannot be given back to the Turks for three reasons: firstly, because of the vengeance that would be wreaked by them on the inhabitants who had taken our side; secondly, because the return of the Turk would mean the downfall of the Arab cause, not in Baghdad only, but throughout Turkish Arabia as far as Syria on the west, and the Hejaz on the south; and thirdly, because there would at once revive on the part of Turkey, that subtle Turco-Germanic plot, to which we so nearly succumbed in the year before the war, the central thread of which was to be the Baghdad Railway, and which was to carry German influence from the Bosphorus to the Persian Gulf and the gates of India. That sinister design has been frustrated, and any British Government would be a traitor to the Empire that permitted its resuscitation. Turkey under German influence at Baghdad, means Persia under German influence at Teheran, and German intrigue rampant in all the States on the western side of India; and let it be borne in mind that, if as the result of the war, the Mitteleuropa policy of Germany, while in the main victorious, is arrested on the Western side by the necessity of evacuating Belgium and France, it is only on the Eastern front that it can expand. Its movement will then be inevitably be towards Aleppo, the Caucasus, and the Caspian. As the &quot; Kolnische Zeitung &quot; let out the other day, &quot; the German work of decades is at stake in Mesopotamia.&quot; To give it a focus and rallying ground by reinstating the Turk in Baghdad will be to give Germany her heart&apos;s desire, and to precipitate a renewed struggle for the East.In the above argument I have assumed that the British will remain in military occupation of the Turkish possessions which they have conquered until the end of the war. They may conceivably even extend the area of their conquest. The opposite hypothesis of a desperate Turco-German attempt to turn them out and recover Baghdad should not be dismissed.  But it does not appear likely to be successful.//. Palestine.The situation in Palestine is somewhat different. From the strategical point of view it is equally important not to allow the Turks to resume possession and control of a country which is the military gate to Egypt and the Suez Canal. Palestine, armed and fortified, might not merely become a powerful wall of defence to the Turkish armies on the south, but it would provide a sally port from which an attack might be made at any time upon the Sinai Peninsula and the valley of the Nile. Knowing as we do the view of the German strategists about the supreme importance of the Suez Canal as the nerve-centre of the British Empire, any British statesmen would indeed be blind who ever allowed the -Turks to reappear in the Holy Land.In this case the sentiment and interests of the world will be enlisted on the same side. They are typified by the fact that the French and Italian flags have been seen with General Allenby&apos;s forces, and that our own Dominions and India will equally have helped to place the Christian colours once more on the walls of Jerusalem. The whole world, America included, will wish this to be the last crusade for the expulsion of the Ottoman Turk, and the recovery of the Holy Places of Christendom. Whatever be the future form of government in Palestine, whether it be placed under the Protectorate of a Christian Power or under a condominium of Powers, or be internationalised, it can never be allowed to return to the Turk. Nor could the hopes held out to the Jewish race, of a future national home in Palestine, difficult as in any case they may be of realisation, have the remotest chance of fulfil-ment, if there were to be any prospect of the return of the Turk. What may befall Syria, in which the French interest is notorious, it is still too early to predict. But the revolting actrocities that have been perpetrated upon the native inhabitants, whether Syrian, Arabs, or Jews, in the &quot;regions lying between the Lebanon and Jerusalem, render it almost impossible to conceive that they shall be exposed again to that hideous misrule.Surely the democracies of the New World as well as the Old will insist that a chance shall be given to the downtrodden but struggling democracies of the East, whether they be Arabs, Svrians, Jews, or Armenians.
III. Arabia.Nowhere will the future of this new uprising require to be more care-fully nurtured and safeguarded than in Arabia proper and the Hejaz. We are in the main responsible for the movement of King Hussein. Though so far highly successful, it is not yet so firmly established as to be free from danger, and we may be sure that as long as the war lasts, and long after, Turkish money and Turkish intrigue will be directed to breaking up the union of the Arab tribes, and recovering the Holy Places of Islam. The employment of that arch-enemy and intriguer, the ex-Khedive of Egypt, is a sufficient evidence of this intention, and among the unalterable aims of the war a high place must certainly be given to the protection of the new kingdom of the Hejaz. The best guarantee for its future will be European influence in Palestine and Syria on the one side, and Mesopotamia on the other. Between them it will grow into health and strength. Deprived of their support, it might languish and expire.I have not said anything here about the Turkish dominions in Europe or in Asia Minor, because while their exact future will depend upon the progress and issue of the war, it does not seem likely that they will, as occupied or conquered territories, be at the disposal of the Allies at the Peace Conference. The expulsion of the Turk from Europe, which was a part of the original Allies&apos; programme, has now receded into a shadowy distance. The partitioning on paper of Asia Minor between European Powers seems likely to have been a purely academic as well as unfortunate exercise. It is enough for the present to discuss the fate of what we have got, without troubling about what we have not.The German Colonies.I now pass to the captured German colonies in different parts of the world. Here, again, the conditions vary considerably, and each unit or group requires to be judged by independent standards. No single formula, either of retention or resti-tution, can be applied without qualification to the whole./. Kiao-chau.This was captured by the Japanese (with some slight assistance from British troops) in the early days of the war, and is held by them. At that time they gave what almost amounted to a promise to restore it to China. But there is not the remotest chance of their doing this; indeed, they are far more likely to base upon it a claim to the whole of the German rights, political and commercial, in the interior of Shantung. Apart from the strategic value of Tsing-tau, the conquest has a senti-mental value for Japan as wiping out the affront put upon her by Germany after her first occupation of Port Arthur in the war with China. Her army and navy are intact, her financial position has been improved by the war, and she is not likely to be amenable to any pressure that can be brought to bear by Germany or the Allies to make her relinquish her prize. Great Britain, at any rate, is in no position to exert such pressure, since we have already committed ourselves to the support of the Japanese claim.//. The Pacific Islands.The same conditions apply to the German islands north of the Equator which Japan conquered and holds, together with a promise from Great Britain to support her claim to permanent possession. Both Australia and New Zealand, in spite of their deep distrust of Japanese policy, have acquiesced in this decision, in view of the assistance lent by the Japanese Navy in the early stages of the war in protecting Australasian convoys and hunting down German raiders.As regards the other German possessions in the Pacific (principally German New Guinea and Samoa), the Australian and New Zealand Governments were invited by His Majesty&apos;s Government to send expeditions for their conquest. They did so, overcame the local resistance, and have administered the islands ever since. The British Government have refrained from annexation, and have held over the ultimate destination of these conquests till the end of the war. But there can be very little doubt as to what it must be. The British Dominions, who have freely offered and sacrificed their manhood in this war, are as entitled to ask for and to receive their very moderate return as are any of the Allies. The security of the British Empire and of the sea routes throughout the world is their chief concern. But they are bound also to consider the safety of their own territories, and with the
he used language which, if at a later date we were to press the Dominions, on whatever grounds, to acquiesce in concession, would expose us to the charge of a breach of faith that could never be forgiven. Should a dispute arise upon this subject at the Peace Conference, it is inconceivable that we should not receive the loyal support of our principal Allies, and notably of France, whose soil has been soaked with the blood of Australian and New Zealand soldiers, voluntarily shed for her defence.7/7. German Colonies in A frica.Before dealing with these acquisitions seriatim- for here again the conditions are not absolutely uniform there are certain broad considerations affecting the policy, past and prospective, of Germany in the African Continent which must be examined.At the beginning of the war the Germans possessed the following colonies in Africa: on the west Coast Togoland, the Cameroons, and German South-West Africa; on the east coast German East Africa. The total population of these terri-tories was about thirteen millions. The German population was only a few thousands. Vast sums of money had been spent by the Germans upon the develop-ment of these territories and their provision with docks, harbours, roads, railways, fortified positions, wireless stations, arsenals, and the elements of a powerful incipient military and naval organisation. That it was only incipient and had not been further developed was one of the few strokes of good fortune that have befallen us during this war. Had it been otherwise the war might very conceivably already have had another termination.I need not here recall the history of German colonisation in Africa, because it is sufficiently well known. But the long story of calculated savagery and bloodshed connected with the name of Karl Peters, and with the treatment of the Hereros by von Trotha, who massacred that unhappy people by thousands, is no isolated phenomenon. It has been repeated in the present war by the German treatment of the Duala tribe, not in a foreign possession, but in their own colony of the Cameroons, when that territory was invaded by the British and French. The argument is pertinent, because it is to such methods and such men that it is proposed to hand back the German colonies which we have captured, with the added certainty of the fearful vengeance that would be wreaked upon the wretched natives who have aided or abetted our cause. We may be sure that a carnival of blood would be inaugurated in every territory so restored; it has, indeed, been openly promised in German East Africa, where the native troops have been kept fighting for Germany xor over two years largely by threats of the appalling consequences that will ensue when tne victorious Teuton returns. Truly may the Allied forces (French, British, iJoer, Indian), who have engaged and expelled this common enemv, say that they [1223] Cexperience&quot; of this war they could not regard without the gravest anxiety the possi-bility of the establishment of German naval bases, submarine bases, wireless stations, and air stations in the Pacific. This would expose them to serious danger on the outbreak of war, would compel them to maintain large naval and military establish-ments, at a cost which their revenues could not support, and would keep the Pacific in a perpetual ferment. This war has fortunately eliminated the German flag from that ocean. - It would be tempting Providence and inviting trouble to permit its reappearance. America and Japan are as much interested in this decision as ourselves. The former would hardly welcome the Germans again at Samoa : the latter have already committed themselves to the support of our claims south of the Equator. . The Prime Ministers of both these Dominions Mr. Hughes, Mr. Massey  and Sir J. Ward, have expressed themselves on their return from England in the strongest possible terms on the matter. The Federal Labour Party in Australia has pronounced in equally emphatic language for retention. There can be no doubt that the whole of the Dominions would regard it as an act of inexpiable desertion if we were to surrender their claims; and when the Governor-General of New Zealand, in opening Parliament on the 28th June, 1917, made the following declaration, after official consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government at home : &quot; I have informed my Ministers that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has assured me that the Imperial Government fully realise the vital importance to this Dominion of the destiny of the German colonies in the Pacific, and that when the time comes the fullest consideration will be given to the wishes of the New Zealand Government &quot; 
have been fighting for the future not so much of the white peoples of Europe as of the black races of Africa itself.The experience of the war has taught yet another lesson. We now see that these German colonies have not been colonies in the real sense of the term, i.e., communities organised for the suppression of barbarism, the spread of civilisation, the social and moral elevation of the people, the growth of legitimate trade. Germany, in her own interests, has not been indifferent to economic development. But, far more than marts, her possessions have been turned into parade grounds for drilling native troops, nests of plotting officials and con-cealed machine guns, jumping-off grounds for attacks upon neighbours or rivals. They have been not merely a scourge to the native inhabitants, but a pest to the continent as a whole.Neither can it be argued that the German colonies in Africa have been required as an outlet for the surplus population of Germany herself. In the first place, for the last quarter of a century Germany has ceased to have any considerable surplus to dispose of; and with the diminishing birth-rate, still further reduced by the ravages of war, she is unlikely to have any for a generation to come. If she had, Africa is the last destination to which she would send them. &quot; A place in the sun &quot; is not an argument that any German could truthfully employ, seeing that the African sun, in the majority of the territories which she either has occupied or still more aspires to occupy, is sufficient to render European settlement and child-bearing on a large scale impossible. Finally, we may take the test of the actual European population of the German African colonies before the war. After forty years of effort it only amounted to some 20,000 of both sexes and all ages in territories that aggregated 1,000,000 square miles.It is fair to say that not even the Colonial party in Germany makes much use of so double-edged an argument. There the possession of a Colonial Empire is openly advocated on two grounds, and two only : (a) for the sake of economic advan-tage; (b) because it is essential to German world power.The first of these reasons has taken on a new form since the war. The German Empire, we are told, must be entirely self-supporting in the future, with a view to the next war. A Tropical Empire is a necessary adjunct to the Mitteleuropa Empire. Rubber is especially important, and Hindenburg has openly proclaimed that &quot; raw materials are necessary for the maintenance of our people and for war munitions which we cannot produce at home.&quot;An even more unblushing avowal is made of the military value to Germany of a great African dominion in the future. Lest there should be any doubt as to the nature of these ambitions, I will quote four representative German opinions, delivered in the course of the war. The professors, as usual, are in the van. Professor Hans Meyer thus expatiates : Our greatest colonial aim in war, as in peace, is the formation of a solid Central African Colonial Empire, in which Mozambique, Angola, and the islands in the Gulf of Guinea will take their place. But German Central Africa could not exist unless it were bound to the mother country by a chain of naval points d&apos;appui, for which the Portuguese possessions of Guinea, Cape Verde Islands, Madeira, and the Azores are clearly designed.&quot;Professor Delbruck is even more explicit. In return for the evacuation of Belgium, Germany is to demand and to receive from the Allies the whole of Central Africa, Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast and Dahomey, Nigeria and Lagos, the Cameroons, San Thome and Principe, the French and Belgian Congo, Katanga and Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Mozambique and Delagoa Bay, Madagascar, Zanzibar, British East Africa, Uganda, Ponte Delgrado, in the Azores; Porto Grande, in the Cape Verde Islands.&quot;It is difficult to find in the above catalogue what is left to anyone else (apart from North Africa, which would be reserved for the next war) except the Transvaal and the Cape, which are no doubt to be handed over to a reconstituted and friendly Boer Republic.The &quot; Vossische Zeitung &quot; is not far behind the professors : &quot; We want a Colonial Empire in Central Africa, to include the Cameroons, the Congo, Portuguese West Africa, German South-West and East Africa, and portions of Portuguese East Africa and Rhodesia. These territories comprise, a solid Colonial Empire which wdl satisfy our workers.&quot;Nor was the official imprimatur wanting, for the &quot; German Imperial Gazette for the Eastern Army &quot; stated in the early days of the war that in addition to conquests at the expense of Great Britain, Germany intended to acquire the Belgian
and French Congo and the Portuguese colonies on the East and West Coasts of Africa, so that there should be ;&apos; a great block of German colonies from the Indian Ocean to the Lakes and from the Congo to the Atlantic.&quot;Finally, the real inwardness of the plan is disclosed by Franz Kolbe, a prolific writer on colonial affairs (.&quot; Deutsche Politik,&quot; December 22, 1918) ; &quot; The black garrison troops in the Cameroons and in German East Africa have given such excellent account of themselves under the leadership of German officers that one may affirm confidently, if Central Africa becomes German and our German colonies are given back to us, German Central Africa, adequately supplied with munitions, could hold out for the longest war. The larger this German Colonial Empire is the more troops will it be able to furnish, the more risky will an attack upon it be for our enemies, and the more enemy troops will our garrison troops keep engaged in Africa in the event of war.&quot;We shall then indeed be foolish if we do not recognise that the objects of German ambition in Africa are fourfold : (a.) The recovery of the whole of her recent colonial possessions.(&amp;.) The destruction of the rival powers and possessions of Britain, France,Belgium, and Portugal, (c.) The creation out of these spoils of a great Central-African Germandominion, &quot; an India in Africa&quot; as it is frequently defined by Germanwriters.(d.) The creation in this dominion of a powerful army of well-armed and well-drilled black soldiers, who would act, firstly as a garrison of the conquered territories, secondly as an army of offence and aggression against the rest of Africa, thirdly as a valuable auxiliary force for employment in extra-African theatres of war.Creation of a Black Army.It is to the last of these objects that I desire to call particular attention, for it portends a danger not only to every European State that owns territory in Africa but to civilisation itself. It is doubtful whether before this war any such idea had taken root in the German mind. But amid many revisions of popular estimate that the war has brought about, none has been more startling than the discovery of the value of the coloured fighting man. Formerly he was regarded as a negligible quantity in European warfare or against European troops armed with all the resources of civilisation. The Indian army of Great Britain was regarded as a possible exception, due to its martial traditions, its long training under British officers, and its frequent experience of war. But from Africa no such portent was expected. However, ex Africa aliquid semper novi has been the sequel. The French have extensively employed their Senegalese troops at Gallipoli, Salonica, and on the Western front with results that have been surprisingly good. Our Nigerian troops in assaulting difficult positions on the Cameroons border behaved in a manner that would have been commendable in the case of British infantry. The Congolese under Belgian officers have done good service in German East Africa, and in the same district the coloured German troops, under German leaders, have sustained a three years&apos; fight against all the forces that we could bring against them, with a staunchness and loyalty that have compelled admiration. The &quot; Kolnische Zeitung &quot; writes as follows about this achievement: &quot; There were about 15,000 native troops, with perhaps 3,000 Europeans, all badlv armed with insufficient artillery and supplies.   Yet this small army has kept the Entente army of about 200,000 men busy.     In view of this latter fact, it is a great  pity  that Germany had not a colonial army about five times as big.     Had this been the case the Entente would not have been able to bring such vast numbers of colonial troops to the European theatre of war.     At present there is nothing to prevent England and Prance from continuing to employ vast hitherto untapped resources in the way of coloured man-power.    Experience of this war has  shown that the East African native, if sufficiently trained and led by Europeans, makes an efficient soldier, while the South-West African is an even better soldier given similar circumstances.     In future, in order to prevent her colonies from being overrun by other peoples, Germany must utilise  to  the  full these resources of man-power.   Such of these natives as have hitherto not been   subject   to Germany must come under her rule, while all foreign colonies which have made war against German colonies must become German property.   A colonial army must be created for colonial needs,, and must not be used in Europe.     A big colonial army based upon long service and retention of time-expired soldiers in reserve would be excellent for the economic development of Germany&apos;s old and new colonies, as discharged soldiers can be made into useful labourers.    Germany must have a strong colonial army to strengthen her position, and at the same time weaken that of her enemies, who must never again be allowed to bring coloured troops to their aid in Europe.&quot;
It will be observed that the above paragraph contains (1) a disclaimer of the intention of Germany to employ such a force outside of Africa, (2) the suggestion that a similar disability should be accepted by Great Britain and France. In the present position of affairs we can well appreciate the nature of this bargain. For many years to come a native African army could not hope to vie with the coloured armies of Germany&apos;s chief rivals. But when it had attained the requisite dimensions and strength, the bargain, if ever concluded, would become &quot; a scrap of paper.&quot; and we might witness the appalling spectacle of an armed black host let loose upon the world.Even were such a prospect not realised, the initiation of the above programme, in its more limited application, would have fearful consequences. For even if we were not driven to counter-measures in the organisation of an African army, which public opinion in England would be slow to tolerate, we should have inflicted upon Africa the very curse from which it is our avowed object to save Europe, viz., the curse of militarism, naked and unashamed. To such a consummation must the creation of a German Colonial Empire in Africa inevitably lead.Future Developments of War.A scarcely less important consideration, in its bearing upon the decision to be arrived at, is the development that has already taken place in this war, and the menace that is involved for the future, in the use on an extended scale of submarines, mines, air fleets, and wireless telegraphy. We already have ample experience of what the submarine can do even when its recognised bases are confined to ports on the German and Belgian coasts. Emerging from securely defended ports in East and West Africa, its efforts co-ordinated and controlled by wireless installations in touch with the German Admiralty in Berlin, its potentialities for mischief would be almost limitless. We may safely assume that the next declaration of war will be, if&quot; not preceded by, at least simultaneous with a, &quot; ruthless&apos;&apos; surprise attack on all enemy shipping shipping, naval or mercantile, within reach; and that the move-ments of troops, munitions and civil supplies will be rendered difficult to the verge of impossibility. On the outbreak of the present war one of the first concerns of the British Navy was to root out the naval bases of the enemy, to round up his scattered raiders, and to protect the Australasian and South African transports. It did not prove an easy task. When these African ports are defended by guns, by minefields, and by submarine squadrons, it is more than doubtful if the navy will prove equal to the task of reducing them while also containing the German High Fleet. When, further, the German stations in Africa are connected by air fleets and plentifully supplied with aerodromes, and when the movements of the cruisers from her harbours are directed from the air, we can understand how formidable a base of pirate operations Africa might supply. Not the least disquieting feature of this scientific equipment is the enormous advantage it will confer on the aggressor, particularly if he is devoid of any regard either for treaties or conventions or for the ordinary dictates of humanity. ,Perhaps we shall best visualise this danger if we imagine what would have happened if at the outbreak of the present war the Germans had enjoyed the advantages which they are now bent upon creating. Their raiders slipping out from secure ports on the eastern and western coasts would have scoured the Indian Ocean on the one side and the Pacific on the other. The damage wrought by the solitary &quot; Emden &quot; is a sufficient indication what a swarm of such hornets might have done. There would have been no question of Indian or Australian troops coming to European theatres of war. On the contrary, many of those regions would themselves have been exposed to attack. As it is, the seas to the east of Suez, though subject to the risk of an occasional corsair and of the mines scattered by him, have been absolutely immune from submarine attacks. With the increasing power and range of submarines, starting from African harbours, the eastern seas will in future be as perilous as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic have been in this war.General Considerations.The danger here sketched is not one that would threaten the British Empire or British interests only. Every Power that has possessions or interests in Africa is equally concerned. Every nation to whom the free navigation of the seas is vital is involved. All the countries situated round the basin of the Indian Ocean would be swept into the same net.   A similar menace, launched from the West African
ports, would await America in the Pacific. The British Empire, if it were to acquiesce in any such development, would be committing voluntary suicide. Other nations would De permitting a weapon to be forged that would later on be held at their own throats.There is yet another general consideration that applies to all of these cases. I have cited the unconcealed German threats of reprisals against all the weaker European Powers in Africa who have opposed her in this struggle. Unless we were to support them which would mean another war the Portuguese and Belgian colonies would be the first to go. But an even worse catastrophe would be the vengeance that would be wreaked upon the native populations of German territories, supposing these to be restored, and the effect that would be produced upon the inhabitants of adjoining and mainly British possessions. When the Germans were leaving the Cameroons they told the natives &quot; we are leaving now, but we shall come back soon,&quot; and everyone knew what that meant. Up to the end in East Africa the dwindling German force was only kept alive by the assurance that the Germans would return, and by the awful threats of what would happen when they did. Von Lettow&apos;s expiring effort to his attenuated band of native soldiers was the amiable assurance that when the colony was handed back &quot; every deserter will be hung.&quot;Long ago we were informed that a declaration that the Germans would never be permitted to recover East Africa would mean an immediate cessation of the struggle. But months of further fighting had to take place and hundreds cf lives to be sacrificed because we were afraid of the taunt of Imperialistic aims, and of the sentimental scruples of only a small fraction of the community. To an African native the reappearance of the German will mean that the German has beaten the British. In his unsophisticated logic it is the vanquished not the victor who disgorges the spoils. Many months ago the &quot; Frankfurter Nachrichtung &quot; summed up the situation in a single sentence, to which there is nothing to add: &quot; The maintenance of our colonies will be the manifestation to the natives that we have won the war.&quot;Let me now proceed to apply these arguments to the several German colonies in Africa wmich have fallen into our hands.Togoland.This is the smallest of the German African colonies. But still it is one quarter the size of Germany, and has a population of 1,000,000. In Lome it possesses a useful port. But its importance in the present conflict was, or might have been, that it possessed a very powerful wireless installation, placed well in the interior at Kamina, which could talk to Berlin and scatter its messages far and wide over the Atlantic. The swift advance of the British forces brought about its destruction within three weeks of the outbreak of war; but this speedy success could hardly be repeated.The Cameroons,This colony is half as large again as Germany. It has a population of 4,500,000, of fair to good fighting qualities. Protected by difficult country on most of the western border it is a proved menace to Nigeria. With another year of preparation the principal harbour, Duala, could have been made impregnable, and the nature of the country is such that any offensive operations against the colony must almost necessarily begin with the reduction of Duala. The capacity of the harbour is illustrated by the fact that when we captured it we found some score of ocean-going craft that had taken refuge there. The strategic importance of the colony is that, like Togoland, it is posted on the flank of the Cape, and is within striking distance of the West African trade route.There has been a provisional partition of both these captures between the British and the French. Whether this be adhered to or departed from in the post-war arrangements it is of equal importance to both countries that their West African possessions should be freed from the menace which a German base at Lome, or still more at Duala, would create. Herr Franz Kolbe, whom I have already quoted, has been kind enough to tell us (u Deutsche Politik,&quot; February 1917) in what way the Germans propose to use the West African position which they hope [1223] I)
fto construct out of the war. After assigning to Germany as indispensable the whole of her old colonies, the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, and Angora, he says:&quot; The whole coast of West Africa from the mouth of the Cross River to the mouth of the Orange River would be in German possession. When one only remembers what immense achievements were performed by the &apos; Emden &apos; in the Indian Ocean and by the &apos; Karlsruhe &apos; in the Atlantic, without any naval base, without any possibility of replenishing in port their supplies of munitions, food, &amp;c.; it will be realised what the fortification of half the West Coast of Africa would signify for Germany and for England. As soon as, in a new war, the Suez Canal is closed against England by the Turks, all traffic between England and India, Australia, and South Africa must go round the Cape of Good Hope. But then all the shipping must pass the coast of German Central Africa. It would be impossible for England any longer to concentrate her whole fleet in the North Sea and to menace Germany. She would be compelled to station a considerable fleet in South Africa for the protection of her trade, and that would mean a not inconsiderable weakening of her forces in European waters.&quot;Togoland may seem a small thing and&quot; the Cameroons not a very large one. I ask why should we offer to Germany the nucleus of a West African dominion which we know is to be used to our detriment, and which will become a certain breeding-ground of intrigue, mischief, and every form of public danger.German South-West Africa.- This territory, defended by the Germans with some 8,000-10,000 men, and pro-vided with a powerful long-distance wireless installation at Windhuk, as well as with other wireless stations on the coast, was conquered by the Union of South Africa Forces under General Botha, after a brilliant six months&apos; campaign, in 1915. Its geographical position, the circumstances in which it was originally acquired by Germany, the objects to which it was put, and the circumstances preceding its invasion and conquest by the Union forces, render it inconceivable that this province should be handed back to Germany save under conditions that would involve the disruption of the British Empire. The weakness and procrastination of the British Government in the early &apos;eighties, that impelled Bismarck to the annexation of this territory by Germany, have never been forgotten in South Africa. But few persons even there realised the formidable nature of the peril that was in course of erection on their borders. The war opened their eyes to the risks that they had run. They found that the territory had become a storehouse of munitions and men, intended for use against themselves; that the intrigues of Germans at their door had lit the flames of civil war, and that they were in the hateful position of having to turn their arms against their own kindred before they could proceed against the foreign foe. To South Africans the return of this territory to Germany would mean the sacrifice of all their efforts, the revival of an ever-present menace on their borders, and a tremendous stimulus to the forces of sedition, always smouldering below the surface in that country of racial problems and passions. General Botha himself stated in August 1915 :-&quot; Originally I said that I was not going to German South-West Africa with the object of land-grabbing. I must, however, say that this attitude has since been considerably altered, owing to the Kaiser&apos;s telegram, in which he said: &apos; I will not only acknowledge the indepen-dence of South Africa, but I will even guarantee it, provided rebellion is started imme-diately.&apos;   For this reason I feel that it is impossible to return the territory to the Germans.&quot;General Smuts said at about the same time :- The people of South Africa must now ask themselves: &apos; Are we going to stick to this country which we have so brilliantly conquered?&apos; It seems as clear as noonday that if South-West Africa does not belong to the Union in future the day will come when the Union will belong to German South-West Africa.&quot;It is needless to argue the case further. The British statesman does not exist who would dare to propose restitution. Nor even if the Germans were so triumphant in the war as to be able to dictate their own terms is it conceivable that any South African Government would be found to consent to evacuation. There, at least, the die is cast.German East Africa.Here we approach by far the most important of these African problems. German East Africa is twice the size of Germany. It has a population of about 71 millions, including some of the best fighting material in Africa.   On the north
it threatens the British East African Protectorate, whose vital nerve, the Uganda Railway, runs for a great part of its length not far from the German border. On the west it is covered by Lake Tanganyika, and, with command of the lake, it is a, menace to the Belgian Congo. To the south it threatens alike the Protectorates of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia and the neighbouring Portuguese possessions. Its greatest strategic importance lies, however, in its eastern frontier a line of nearly 500 miles of coast facing the Indian Ocean. In Tanga, Dar-es-Salaam, and. still more in Kilwa Kisiwani, it possesses good and defensible harbours, and the possibilities of the Rufigi delta as a lurking-place for marauders were demonstrated by the &quot; Kbnigsberg&quot; episode. With the diversion of shipping from the Suez Canal round the Cape of Good Hope which has taken place during this war and would assuredly be necessary again- it-lies on the very flank of the trade routes to India and the Far East. This territory has been the scene of embittered fighting, prolonged for more than three years, and only now terminated. The enemy possessed a native army of at least 18,000 men, well disciplined and capably led, with a plentiful supply of rifles, guns and ammunition. At the outset the British forces, not organised for war, were greatly outnumbered, and could not protect even our own territory. The tide was turned when, in 1916, General Smuts appeared on the scene with a large South African force and a con-tingent from Rhodesia. Since then these troops have been replaced for the most part by native forces and by Indian troops and men from other parts of Africa. There have been great obstacles to be overcome fighting over marshes, across moun-tains and deserts, in dense bush ; but gradually the enemy has been driven back, and the end has come.The question for settlement is, Can this great possession, for the conquest of which so much&apos;blood, both European and native, has been shed, which has at last been recovered by efforts in which so many parts of the Empire have loyally joined, and which in the hands of the Germans is fraught with such infinite possibilities, for exploitation on the one hand, for military and naval mischief on the other, ever be allowed to revert to German hands? It is the crucial case of the entire problem, the test by which the future of Africa and, as I think, of the Eastern Empire o$ Great Britain will be decided. No effort, intrigue, pressure, menace will be wanting on the part of Germany to recover it. Dr. Solf, the German Colonial Secretary, has described its rendition as an unalterable and irreducible condition of peace. Ger-many will endeavour to set it off against the evacuation of Belgium or the restitution of Alsace-Lorraine or the war aims of one or another of the Allies in Europe. No stone will be left unturned to sow dissension between the latter, and to represent the selfish and Imperialistic ambitions of Great Britain if she refuses, at whatever cost, to surrender it, as responsible either for the continuance of the war or the humilia-tion of this or that European Power or the rupture of the Entente.And yet I have no hesitation in declaring that the Government which, except under the compulsion of serious defeat, consented to give back German East Africa would be untrue to its trust, and would inflict an injury upon the Empire and to the future peace of the wrorld for which generations still unborn would pay the price and execrate the authors, I pass by the arguments, every one of wmich is valid in this case, about the loss of prestige and the suffering to the native peoples that would ensue from our concession. I say nothing about the almost incredible sacrifices that have been made by the white population of British East Africa, who confidently expect that security for the future will be their minimum recompense, or about the expenditure that will be entailed if the British and German Protectorates embark, as will be almost inevitable, upon a competition in armaments which will both throw-back the peaceful progress of East Africa and lead straight to future wars. Neither do I here lay stress upon the claim that will undoubtedly, and with good reason (for the Indian army has contributed largely to the conquest of the country) be set up by the Indian Government to a share for its surplus population in the future settle-ment and colonisation of these territories, containing as they do so many empty spaces, so well suited to the conditions of Indian agriculture and life though it will be remembered that this claim was most powerfully urged by the Indian representatives at the Imperial War Cabinet last Spring.I prefer to rest my case upon military, strategical, and political considerations.General Smuts stated the case from the point of view of the British Empire when he said in May 1917 :-&quot; We are now in the happy position of having a through line from Egypt to the Cape, and of having no danger, either on the Atlantic seaboard or the Indian seaboard, to our
&apos;A New Monroe Doctrine.I regard the case in an even wider perspective, for it seems to me that for no European Power, using either the Suez Canal and Red Sea routes or the Cape route as a means of communication with the East; for no State with interests or posses-sions in the Indian Ocean or beyond ; and for none of the Australasian Dominions of Great Britain, will national existence or trade be secure so long as this tiger-power is waiting ready in the event of war, or perhaps even without it, to spring forth from his lair on the African coast. Let us assume that the United States of America were responsible for Egypt and the Soudan, for Mombasa and Zanzibar; that they had, after a costly and exhausting war, set up a great self-governing community of white races in South Africa; and, lastly, that they had assumed and borne for a century and a. half the burden of maintaining peace and order in the vast continent of India and preparing its peoples by slow stages for self-government, would they tolerate for one moment the reinstallation, after he had once been detected and crushed, of this arch-robber, the bandit of humanity, on their flank ? No; there would be a Monroe Doctrine for Africa as there has been for South America, and with an even stronger justification. Similarly, if the American Republic were a great colonial Power, and if it had in the passage of time thrown out a number of off-shoots, which had grown into powerful and free communities anxious to develop their own ideals and to build up the national and economic fabric of their several States in peace and security on a non-militarist basis, would its Government regard with equanimity the foundation by an openly hostile and treacherous enemy of military and naval bases, great armies and arsenals, and points of vantage by land and sea, designed for no other purpose than to thwart this pacific purpose and to secure the future mastery of the world? Again the answer would, I feel sure, be in the negative.Let me pursue for a moment the argument based on the analogy of the Monroe Doctrine. What the United States have felt compelled from motives of self-interest and national security to lay down in the case of Central and South America, viz., the policy of hands off, other nations, including ourselves, have been obliged to adopt elsewhere. For three centuries the freedom of the Low Countries, i.e., the principle that the mouths of the Scheldt and the Rhine, with their great strategical oppor-tunities, shall not be in the occupation of an aggressive military Power, whether it was Spain, the France of Louis XIV, or the France of the Revolution and Napoleon, has been the corner-stone of the Continental policy of Great Britain. It was for this reason that the neutrality of Belgium was guaranteed by Treaty in 1839, and the violation of that neutrality by one of the signatory Powers was the immediate cause of our entering the v,rar in 1914.For similar reasons Great Britain has not allowed, and could never afford to allow, a rival Power^ to establish military or political ascendancy in Egypt, Afghanistan, or Tibet, because any such rival preponderance would jeopardise, on the one side our connections with India, on the other side the security of India itself. We have even fought several, wars in defence of this basic principle. Japan would be similarly bound to resist any attempt to set up a foreign military domination in Manchuria, Have not the Overseas Dominions of Great Britain an equal right to formulate such a doctrine in their own defence ? They are in many ways in the same kind of position to-day that the United States were in 100 years ago, i.e., they have small populations but immense territories to develop, and they wish to be free to devote their entire energies and resources to this task, without the perpetual terror of an armed burglar at their gate. They have no wish to interfere with existing States or Powers, or to win territories at the expense of others. The colonies of Belgium. Portugal, and Holland find their chief safeguard in the attitude and policy of Great Britain. Belgium and Portugal will, in fact, be the principal gainers by a policy of hands off to Germany in iifrica, since without it they will sooner or later be forced to succumb. It can scarcely be less welcome to France, with her considerable colonial territories in the interior and on the. West Coast of Africa, and with her island possessions of Madagascar and Reunion in the Indian Ocean.essential sea communications as an Empire. What will happen to these communications after the settlement nobody knows. But I hope it will be borne in mind that East Africa gives us not only this through line of communication from one end of the continent to the other, but that East Africa also ensures to us the sea road round the Cape, and also the sea road through the Bed Sea.&apos;&apos;
Conclusion.I arrive, therefore, at the conclusion that, except in the case of a complete Allied defeat in the war, when the terms would be imposed by the enemy rather than laid down by us, none of the German colonies in Africa should be given back to her, and that the Allies, including America; should, in the widest interests of the future peace of &quot;the world, be invited to give a unanimous support to this principle. An Africa without Germany will have a chance of developing on the lines of civilised progress. An Africa with Germany will become a cockpit of sanguinary conflicts and pernicious ambitions.J &quot;ossible Criticisms.But there are certain criticisms to which this policy will doubtless be exposed, and which I should like before concluding to meet. It may be said that the loss of her colonies will constitute a permanent root of bitterness between Germany and the Allies, and that we shall, in fact, be creating a new Alsace-Lorraine in inter-national affairs. This is. I think, a complete misunderstanding of the attitude of the Germans towards their colonies and of the part which the latter fill in German national life and sentiment. The German colonies are in no sense an integral feature of the life of the German people. They have played no part in its past history, and form no element in the ordinary peaceful citizen&apos;s social and political horizon. While one white British subject in every four lives in a British dominion or colony, only one German in four thousand lives in a German colony. To German national sentiment the fate of the whole of the German colonies is of infinitely less moment than the fate of Alsace-Lorraine, of Posen, of Schleswig-Holstein, or of the German population of Bohemia or of Courland. Their loss would be regarded not as an amputation inflicted upon the living body of the German nation, but as a war indemnity paid, not in money, but in large undeveloped resources. On the other hand, the German colonies have most certainly formed an integral element in Germany&apos;s schemes of ambition and conquest. They have not been the outcome of a natural process of growth, but were acquired as stepping-stones in a deliberate policy of world-expansion which could only be realised at the expense of other nations, and more particularly of the British Empire. To quote the language used before the war by Herr von Heydebrand : &quot; Colonial policy is only the beginning of our plans for conquest in world politics.&quot; The restoration of the German colonies will only tend to confirm Germany in the policy underlying this sentence. Their retention by the Allies, while inflicting no irremediable injury on the national life of Germany, will mark the bankruptcy of that policy, and thereby pave the way to a condition of things in which the warfare between the British and German Empires will not be an inseparable feature of their future existence.Nor is the possession of colonies an essential to Germany&apos;s future as a great and prosperous European Power. Austria-Hungary is a great Power, but has never embarked on a policy of colonial expansion, and her inferiority to Germany has been due not so much to the absence of colonies as to general backwardness of development and weaknesses due to her composite internal structure. Even in the case of Germany her colonies have, as a matter of fact, hitherto played only a very small part in her economic life.. She has drawn infinitely less of her economic strength from them than she has,from the raw materials of the British Empire and from her free access to the British market. So far as the question of prosperity goes, what Germany requires is not so much colonies as freedom from an economic boycott. Of course, she would prefer to have a great tropical dominion under her own exclusive control, either in direct contact with Central Europe, or else sufficiently large and powerful to hold its own throughout a long war; but from the point of View of the peace of the world it is obviously better that Germany should not be in that position, but that if she offends the world at large by her actions she should run the risk of economic boycott. The power of enforcing this boycott is one to which believers in the League of Nations attach the greatest importance, and its application would be obviously frustrated if Germanv could control within her territories the whole of tne tropical products which she desires.It may also be pointed out that a wholesale is far more likely than a partial connscation of Germany&apos;s possessions in Africa to extinguish her colonial ambitions, oy cutting them off at the root. If she be left with her West African colonies she win not resc till she has expanded them at the expense of her neighbours.   If EastW^\1S      to her&apos; the lure of a Sreat tropical dominion will always be flitting before her eyes and beckoning her onP223] E
Another question that is sometimes raised, though as it seems to me with singularly slender justification, is that of the ethical right of Great Britain or any other victorious Power to retain the colonies which she has won by conquest in war. The answer is simple. The right is precisely the same as that by which Germany acquired them in the first place, or if victorious would recover ,them now. It &quot;has been, generally conceded that the higher standards of civilisation which have been developed by the white man have conferred upon him a general: right of entry into the darker places of the earth where superstition and barbarism prevail. But this mission does not give an exclusive right of entry to any one nation or group of nations. Our right is not superior to that of Germany. But it is certainly no whit inferior, and in so far as the sentiment of the native popu-lations is concerned, in parts of the world where, as in Africa, the two methods of government can be compared with each other, there is no cant in declaring that the British right has the sanction of a far greater measure of popular approval. When, therefore, the question is raised of deciding at a Peace Conference the fate of this or that territorial spoil of war by the votes of its inhabitants, while it is obviously impossible to have a plebiscite of Hottentots or Bantus, the decision, on the hypothesis of equality of rights, must obviously be influenced by a broad considera-tion of the character and results of the two governing systems.Again, I have seen it argued that it may be desirable to purchase the good will of Germany in the future by making concessions which prudence would otherwise condemn. I ask the simple questions : &quot; Did the late Lord Salisbury by ceding Heligoland to, Germany in Europe, or by yielding to her Dar-es-Salaam and the hinterland opposite Zanzibar in Africa, and deflecting the frontier line at every point to her: advantage and our own detriment, conciliate her good will?&quot; This war supplies the answer. I might also ask : &quot; Is Germany, in the event of victory, at all likely to make things pleasant for us?&quot;But we shall be told that the retention of these colonies is only another illustra-tion of the land-grabbing proclivities of Great Britain and of the imperialistic aims with which she entered the war. The facts are in themselves a sufficient refutation of the latter charge, since the first authorisation of the Dominions&apos; offensive was confined to the seizure and immobilisation of enemy wireless stations and bases, and it was not till we found the German possessions in Africa were used as a base of intrigue and offence against our own territories or dominions that we were driven to clear them of the enemy. How comes it that not only has British imperialism left untouched the weak colonial possessions of Belgium, Portugal, and Holland, but that they actually find in it the main guarantee for their continued existence? And if British imperialism is to be denounced, with what face can it be proposed to re-enthrone German imperialism in its place? If it be a question of the two forms of imperialism, let the world judge. The truth is that the epithet &quot; imperialism,&quot; like the epithet &quot; capitalistic,&quot; has become one of the cant formulas of the doctrinaires of revolution; and the rescue of a subject people from cruelty and oppression, which is a virtue if achieved by a small people, becomes a crime if accomplished by a great Empire.In this context the catchword of &quot;No annexation,&quot; which to many is endowed with so much attraction, may be thought to have a bearing on the African situation. What, however, does this formula mean?, Does it signify that whatever any belligerent country possessed before the war, whether rightly or wrongly, is to be restored to it? Does it signify, for instance, that Armenia and Palestine are to go back to Turkey; that Arabia is to lose its tardily won independence; and that the African bushmen are again to acknowledge a German master ? If so, the war will have been waged in vain, and millions of lives will have been sacrificed to stereotype the most shocking injustice. Or does it mean that the larger ambitions with which some Powers entered upon the war, e.g., the desire of Russia for Constantinople, or of Italy for Dalmatia, shall be modified or abandoned? Even if there were not a great deal to be said for this solution, the logic of events will in any case enforce it; but may we not remark to the Germans, &quot; Que messieurs les assassins commencent&quot; ? Even so, it should be remarked that it is a very different thing to renounce that which you have not got and have no hope of getting, to surrender that which you have won by force of arms and hold in trust for future security. Or does the phrase only signify, as M. Tereschenko, when Foreign Minister of Russia, explained to the British Ambassador, a repudiation of &quot; the forcible occupation of any territory against the wishes of its inhabitants &quot; ? If so. the resettlement of the map of Africa will assuredly not be on German lines.   Or do
the words mean that there should he no actual incorporation of conquered territory in the dominions of the conqueror, but that the absorption.may be veiled by such con^ stitutional fictions as a protectorate,, a sphere of influence, a buffer State, and so on? - In one sense: this may provide a not unfair solution, since, as has been pointed out, the setting up of Arab and Syrian and Armenian independence under the pro-lection of one or other European Powers is one of the avowed war aims of the Allied Powers. But does anyone seriously propose a Hottentot Republic at one extreme? Or if, at the other, Germany, under the plea of &quot; No annexation,&quot; erects Poland,. Lithuania, and Courland into protected States, does anyone pretend that the reality of absorption will not be there? , It seems desirable, in this or in any subsequent discussion, to eschew as far as possible the use of phrases which are ambiguous and misleading. From one point of view the policy of &quot; No annexation &quot; may be one to which not idealists alone, but practical men, can honestly subscribe. From another it may turn out to be a subterfuge, masking grave hidden dangers.But, putting aside all verbal refinements and subtleties, there is yet another sense in which, as Mr. Asquith frankly admitted in the House of Commons (May 16, 1917) annexation may well be justified; namely-&quot; for the purpose of maintaining strategic positions which are shown to be necessary, not for aggression, but for the purpose of self-protection and defence against further attacks. You must be most scrupulous and careful in the application of that principle, but that there are and conceivably may be cases in which.the transfer of territory would be justifiable for that purpose seems to me to stand for common sense.&quot;Even if there were no other case, as there is, for the annexation of the German colonies in Africa, enough has already been said to show that on the above ground it is imperative and unassailable.But there is yet another plea that is urged by some who in the desire to escape the snare of one catchword, fall incontinently into the trap of another. Why, it is said, not avoid the odium of annexation, by internationalising the territories which Germany has forfeited and cannot be allowed to redeem? What does internationalisa-tion mean? If it means that in different parts of Africa there is to be set up adminis-tration by an International Board, composed, it may be supposed, of representatives of Great Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal, America, * possibly of Germany itself, I tremble at the contrast that will be presented between the areas that are ruled by a single Government, and the suggested muddle of conflicting interests and ambitions. Gone for ever is the possibility of establishing the polyglot tyranny known as the Congo regime, so much sighed for by European captains of industry forty years ago. The experience of the Anglo-French condominium in the New Hebrides, which has been a failure so conspicuous that both parties are looking eagerly to the arrangements that will follow upon the termination of the war for its total abolition, is no more encouraging than was that of the Dual Control in Egypt. Ask the native himself, and he will at once reply that he would sooner work out his own salvation under the aegis of any one of the Allied Powers whom he knows, than under a mixed Cabinet of nations. Further, let not the future be forgotten. Whether Germany were or were not admitted to such a Board at the start, she would soon be represented there, and the era of intrigue and fraud would recommence. Relieved of direct authority the weary statesmen and officials of the other Powers would disclaim any national responsibility for wrong-doing under an International Board, and in the end we might see a coalescence of all the coloured races against any white-man interference with Africa at all.The objections to Internationalisation would be not diminished but greatly enhanced if, as has been innocently suggested in certain quarters, the belt of tropical Africa so treated were enlarged, with a view to giving to it a substantial geographical continuity and a more ample scope, into a new Central African State, to which large contributions should be made, as the result either of sale or of gratuitous generosity, by the various European Powers. At the mere breath of such a rumour a few months ago, Portuguese opinion, always sensitive about its colonies, went into paroxysms of agitation. Belgium is not in the least likely to make any surrender of her Congo Empire, which after passing through a stormy and blood-stamed childhood, has emerged into a healthy and remunerative adolescence. The surrender of any British colony in Africa, where there are white settlers, to such a State would mean a rebellion in far wider areas. It may be possible, and would probably be desirable, to have much greater uniformity of European administration m Africa after the war, with a&apos; system, either of complete free trade or low
preferential duties throughout the tropical belt as laid down by the Berlin or Brussels Acts, and with a more or less identical code of municipal and domestic regulations. It may be both desirable and possible to limit by agreement the military training of African natives to police purposes. But an international administra-tion would, it is feared, only be a nursery of international quarrel, and the prelude to greater disaster.Fear has been expressed that the views put forward in this memorandum may not commend themselves to American opinion. I do not share that view. As long as the retention of the German colonies is made to wear an imperialistic or monopolistic aspect, suspicion will be aroused. But when it is realised that this is a question of world safety, of the future development of the black races, and of peace instead of war in Africa, the thoughtful judgment, both of Allied and Neutral States will be in general accord. Already there are signs of a marked reaction in the United States. President Lowell, of Harvard University, has openly stated in September 1917, that &quot; the oppression of one race by another must as far as possible be removed, and for that reason we cannot consider the return to Germany of her former colonies, that their people may be exploited in the future as they have been in the past..&quot; An American War Society has been formed, one of the planks in whose platform is the non-return of the German colonies. Articles have appeared in the American papers arguing on the ground, not of British but of colonial sentiment, that retrocession is impossible.What should be the moment at which a statement of these views is made, if they are accepted as a part of the war intentions of Great Britain, and, as I hope, of the Allies it is not necessary now to discuss. The important thing is that the arguments should be known, and should be Judged upon their merits. It is in order to bring them to the notice of those concerned that I have written this paper.CURZON OF KEDLESTON5th December, 1917.0&apos;
