[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.; Printed for the War Cabinet. March 1918.SECRET. GL-162.REPORT OE THE EGYPTIAN ADMINISTRATION  COMMITTEE. (This Report was written by Lord Curzon, and adopted by the Committee.)THE appointment by the War Cabinet of a Committee to consider the future conduct of Egyptian administration in this country arose out of a Paper, submitted by Lord Edward Cecil, proposing the immediate creation of a separate Department or Ministry in London, distinct from the Foreign Office both in its location, staff, and traditions, though nominally under the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. This Department was advocated on the ground that the affairs of Egypt had already become, and with the close of the war would in an ever-increasing degree continue to be, administrative rather than political; and that, as such, they required treat-ment by experts with special experience such as the Foreign Office staff could not, except in rare and accidental circumstances, provide. It was contemplated that, such a Department might, if the close of the war left both Aden, Arabia, and possibly Mesopotamia either in British hands or under a British Protectorate, expand into an entirely new organisation which might be divorced from tfie Foreign Office altogether.These proposals were supported in evidence by Sir H. McMahon, but were con-tested in printed memoranda submitted by Sir R. Graham and Lord Harclinge, and in oral evidence by Sir M. Cheetham.Mr. Storrs wrote a draft report which, while correctly interpreting the general sense of the evidence and the broad deductions to be drawn from the enquiry, j appeared to import into the proceedings pf the Committee an undue proportion of the evidence itself, and to be more precise and definite than was justified by what had actually taken place.,Lord Milner subsequently wrote a note in which he placed himself, on &apos;the whole, definitely on the side of Lord Edward Cecil.At a still later date, a note by Mr. Montagu, Secretary of State for India, who had stopped in Egypt on his way out to India, was circulated to the War-Cabinet, in which he adumbrated, as the future solution of this Eastern problem, the perpetuation of something like the present Middle East Committee, providing for the due co-ordination of the Home with the Indian points of view.In these circumstances it is not easy to construct a report which will do full justice to all these varying views, or succeed in fusing them into a harmonious whole.Nevertheless, there was, I think, a sufficient preponderance of opinion in favour of certain propositions to justify an effort to place them on record, both for immediate use and possibly for ulterior action.1. There was a general agreement that, should the war result in placing the administrative control of Mesopotamia and Arabia in British hands, there would require to be a new Department in the Home Government to deal specifically with these problems, together with those of Aden, Egypt, and the Sudan. What form it should take, whether it should or should not be a Department of the Foreign Office, it was unnecessary and would be premature to decide; though the preponder-ance of opinion was clearly opposed to any complete divorce from the Foreign Office.2. A second alternative, which might present itself at the close of the war, would be the administration by the British Government of Egypt, including the ^utlan and Aden, together with the political relations of the Hejaz, assuming this kingdom to survive, but without Mesopotamia and Arabia in its broadest sense, assuming the two latter not to pass into the British sphere. For such a contingency, again, the creation of a new organisation might very likely be required.3 Palestine, which had not then been successfully invaded, was not mentioned, -but whatever the form of future political control, whether British or international, [310]
the representation of Palestinian interests, whether it was or was not supervised from Cairo, would also fall under the charge of the same body, Department, or organisation in London,4. There remained the case of Egypt during the war, that is, until such period as the solution of the larger problems should have assumed a much clearer and more definite shape. It was felt that the association of administration with diplomacy in Egypt was, and must continue for some time to be, so close that it was out of the question at this juncture to remove Egyptian affairs from the Foreign Office. Fortunately the latter is peculiarly fortunate in possessing at the present time an Assistant tinder-Secretary, Sir R. Graham, with exceptional Egyptian experience; and there was a general consensus that it would be a great mistake not to profit by his services as the Assistant Under-Secretary responsible for Egyptian affairs, assisted, as he no doubt would be, by a British official of special Egyptian experience.5. Either now or as soon as the increase of business demanded, it was thought desirable that this Department should be strengthened by the addition of a limited number of officials from the Anglo-Egyptian Service, selected because of their special familiarity with the administrative problems of Egypt, to which country they would revert after a few years&apos; service in the Foreign Office, thus maintaining a constant flow not only of fresh blood but of recent experience. The diplomatic side of the work would be performed by Foreign Office clerks or officials similarly assigned for the purpose. In this way would be constituted a separate department of the Foreign Office capable of expansion, when circumstances required, either into a larger and better-equipped body still under the Secretary of State, or into the more independent organisation which was the ideal of some of the witnesses.(Initialled)        C. of K.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., February 20, 1918.\
