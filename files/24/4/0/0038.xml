G.-156,158, 159, 160,161, 166,167, 168, 170, 175, 177, and 183, and War Cabinet 247 (8), 265 (1-8) and (19), 273 (16), 283 (17), and 312 (6) and (7).1. The War Cabinet has already passed a resolution (War Cabinet 247, Minute 8) deciding that the dye industry shall be classed as a war industry for all purposes.   ;The War Cabinet is now asked to approve the following Recommendations, which are put forward by the Board of Trade to give effect to this decision, and with a view ito the development of the British dye industry.These Recommendations (Appendix I, pp. 4 to 6) are endorsed by the Economic Offensive Committee, in whose opinion the matter is one of great urgency.2. The following is a summary of these Recommendations. It will be observed that, with one possible exception (paragraph 4, subsection (&amp;)), no special legislation is required in order to give effect to them: (a.) That financial advances should be made to private firms engaged in the dye trade, with the object of promoting (i.) Development and Extensions, (ii.) Research^(&amp;.) That the Board of Trade should retain powers (i.) To regulate such&apos;developments and extensions!(ii.) To limit profits for certain periods, or until the advances are repaid.(iii.) To decide the kinds and quantities of dye-stuffs to be manu-factured.(c.) That the import of dye-stuffs after the war should be prohibited exceptunder licence for a period of not less than ten years, (d.) That the dye industry should have the status of munitions of war asregards the supply of (i.) Materials required (1) for the industry itself; (2) far plant; and(3) for extensions, (ii.) Labour required for (1), (2), and (3) as above.(iii.) Exemptions and release from military service (1) of skilled chemists and chemical engineers of military age; (2) of students at universities who are training bond fide to become research chemists; and (3) of trained chemists who are already enlisted in the army.3. The Recommendations of the Board of Trade are accompanied -by a Historical Survey of the steps which have been taken since the outbreak of war to establish and develop the British dye industry.* The Board of Trade will keep in touch with the Committee of Scientific and Industrial Research, who, we are informed, are doing good work in similar directions.[147] - - b
4. We desire to supplement this Historical Survey only in one particular. On the 12th September, 1916, the Board of Trade submitted a Memorandum upon the dye situation to a Cabinet Committee consisting of Mr. Runciinan, Mr. McKenna, Mr. Bonar Law, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, and Dr. Addison. On the 6th October this Committee reported unanimously to the Cabinet (a.) In favour of promoting a fusion of the chief dye manufacturing concerns in the United Kingdom; this measure having become more than ever necessary by reason of the fact that, since the outbreak of war, the German dye manufacturers have united in a single combination. (&amp;.) In favour of -prohibiting the importation of dye-stuffs after the war exceptunder licences granted by a Dyes Commission, (c.) In favour of encouraging the manufacture of the more difficult dyes during the reconstruction period by special measures (e.g., subsidies, assistance to scientific research, &amp;c., &amp;o).5. The Runciman Cabinet Committee included among its members the present Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Reconstruction, as well as the late President of the Board of Trade, and the late Secretaries of State for Home Affairs and for India. Notwithstanding its weighty and representative character its recommendations have not yet been carried out in any important particular: (a.) For reasons, which are explained in the Historical Survey, the fusion of the dye manufacturing concerns in the United Kingdom has not been undertaken.(&amp;.) The prohibition of the import of dye-stuffs after the war, except under licences, can be secured, if so desired, without legislation, provided there is no special discrimination against dyes of any particular origin; other-wise legislation will be required to prohibit the importation of dye-stuffs for the period suggested by the Board of Trade, which is much longer than that contemplated for the exercise of the powers sought under the Imports and Exports Bill which has now been introduced into Parliament.(c.) The encouragement of the manufacture of the finer sorts of dye-stuffs is the main purpose of the Recommendations which are now put forward by the Board of Trade.6. Owing to the diversion of a great part of the energies of British dye manu-faoturers since March 1915, to the making of munitions, to the almost complete absorption of their remaining energies in the manufacture of the commoner sorts of dye-stuffs, on which it has been easy during the war to earn huge commercial profits, and to the consequent failure of their efforts to establish a co-ordinated scheme for research, it has been altogether impossible to concentrate upon the production of the finer sorts of dyes.7. The finer sorts of dyes are not only more difficult to manufacture, but are also less remunerative to the producer, while they are even more essential to national safety than the commoner sorts.8. For the purpose of exercising pressure upon the German Government, and also upon public opinion in Gejrmany, during the war, during the negotiations for peace, and during the period of reconstruction, we regard it as of the highest importance that our control of raw materials should be hampered as little as possible by our dependence upon the enemy for any essential constituent of our own manu-factures. Apart from the actual raw materials, dye-stuffs are the most essential of these constituents. As Mr. Runciman&apos;s Cabinet Committee has pointed out, they are &quot; by far the most important and characteristic of the key-industries which we have allowed to fall under the control of our present enemies.&quot;9. Unfortunately Germany&apos;s predominance in the dye industry and our own weakness in regard to this essential constituent will undoubtedly give her an effective means of attack. Unless, therefore, we are able to make ourselves to a. great extent independent of German dye-stuffs before the end of the war, we shall be deprived of a great part of our advantage in bargaining.10. As regards the commoner sorts of dyes we are already in a position of practical independence. We must not, however, overlook the fact that, should it be necessary to return to Germany after the war far the finer sorts of dyes, it is probable that these would be refused unless we were also prepared to take the commoner sorts. If we were obliged to assent to this condition it is clear that the British (lye industry would be forced out of existence.
11. On the other hand, as regards the finer sorts of dyes (i.e., &quot; fast&quot; dyes), which even under war conditions are of immense importance to the textile and other colour using industries, and which under normal conditions are absolutely indispens-able if these industries are to maintain their position in international competition, we are at present in a position to produce only about 15 per cent, of our require-ments. Of the remainder about 60 per cent, are supplied by Switzerland, whilst the balance are unobtainable at the moment, and in normal times would only be pro-curable from Germany.12. As regards these finer sorts of dyes we shall be in a still worse position under normal peace conditions than we are at present; for, seeing that we can pro-duce no more than 15 per cent, of ouir requirements, it is calculated that we shall have to look to Switzerland for 45 per cent, and to Germany for 40 per cent. (Board of Trade Memorandum, p. 4, para. 3).13. It should be clearly understood that our textile export trade to foreign markets will be hopelessly hampered unless we are able to offer as full a range of shaded as any of our competitors.14. It is obvious, therefore, that during the reconstruction period Germany, owing to her position in regard to dye-stuffs, will be able (a.) To boycott our textile industry by refusing to supply dyes; (&amp;.) To charge us exorbitant prices for dyes; or(c.) To kill our newly established dye industry by insisting, as a condition! of supplying us with dyes which we cannot possibly do without, that we shall also buy from her other dyes which we are now in a position to manufacture for ourselves.15. We are not aware that Germany is interested in or has any control over the Swiss firms which are at present supplying us with these finer sorts of dyes! but should these firms ever become in any sense tributary to the German industry-we shall then obviously find ourselves in a much more serious position than if they remain bond fide independent firms.16. Our conclusion is that there is no item in our economic offensive of greateii urgency and importance than that we should make ourselves, so far as is humanly possible, independent of Germany in the matter of dyes before the war ends. We must see our way to secure our supplies of this essential constituent, otherwise one of our greatest assets for bargaining purposes our control of raw materials will be greatly reduced in value.17. These Recommendations are not put forward as a final solution of the problem, but only as an instalment. The development of the British dye industry continues to engage the active concern of the Board of Trade, which hopes to be in a position to put forward further proposals at an early date. For example, in view of the importance of the fusion of British concerns engaged in the dye industry, we cannot submit to regard the attainment of this end as impossible.18. We summarise the chief objects which we have in view as follows: (a.) The defence of these British industries which are dependent on dye-stuffs.Industries of this character are practically innumerable; they cover agreat part of the field of production, but the great textile industry isindividually by far the most important. (&amp;.) An economic offensive against the German textile industry.   This can onlybe carried on effectively if we succeed in making ourselves practicallyindependent of Germany in the matter of dye-stuffs, (c.) An economic offensive against the German dye monopoly by the secureestablishment of a British dye industry.The last (c) is important, but subordinate. In our opinion it is almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of the second (b) for negotiation, and for the purposes generally of the economic offensive.19. The War Cabinet is therefore asked to approve the recommendations of the Board of Trade which are summarised in paragraph 2, and which are set out in full in Appendix I, pp. 5 and 6.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., January 8, 1918.
APPENDIX I. E.0.C.-41. -Memorandum by the Board of Trade.  Scheme for Byes Development.The position of the dye industry at the outbreak of war, with its practically complete dependence on Germany, and the successive steps that have since been taken to meet the critical situation which then existed, are explained in the accompanying Historical Survey.The present position may be summarised as follows: 1. The actual requirements of the trades dependent upon dyes for  (a.) War needs, e.g., the supply of clothing for the army and navy; (b.) The minimum needs for home civilian use; and (c.) The maintenance of the more essential portions of the export trade,have been fairly met by the methods described in the Survey, of which an important-part is the supply received from Switzerland under a special arrangement made with the Swiss manufacturers, on whom we are still largely dependent for the supply of the more difficult and special dyes previously only made in Germany.2. The English manufacturers have succeeded in manufacturing the ordinary ;.and common dyes in sufficient quantity to meet not only the war demand at home, but to a large extent the demands of our Allies, and it may be considered that as far as this branch of dye manufacture is concerned, they will be able to continue to meet the after-war demands in this country if safeguarded from unfair German competition, and further to manufacture in sufficient quantity to enable them to compete in the world markets on equal terms with other countries if in the mean-time they are able to proceed with the necessary development of their works.3. While the production of the commoner dyes may be considered as more or less assured, this is unfortunately not the case in regard to the special dyes of which Germany had a practical monopoly before the war, and relatively little progress has been made in this direction.British manufacturers have confined themselves almost entirely to those ranges of dyes for which, to meet war requirements, there was a great and immediate demand, and which, in proportion to the capital expenditure required, could be made in large quantities. On the othef hand the production of the more difficult and special dyes required a much greater expenditure of capital in proportion to the resulting quantities; a much larger technical and trained staff; greater expendi-ture in research, and a heavy outlay on special plant, while they had no certain prospect of future security, and were faced with the always prominent fear of being swamped by German competition after the war. The technical skill required for the development of this side of the industry wTas not available in this country in anything like the degree that would have enabled this special work to be successfully undertaken at once, and its cultivation and organisa-tion demanded resources that were not at the disposal of the trade. The result is that little progress has been made, and we have been almost entirely dependent on the Swiss in this respect. It is estimated that of the quantities of these particular dyes that would be considered necessary on a pre-war basis for the successful maintenance of our textile trades we are to-day in this country only in a position to furnish about 15 per cent Of the remainder, the Swiss can supply about 45 per cent., but about 40 per cent, is not so far being made at all outside Germany.4. British Dyes, Limited, which was formed with Government financial assist-ance early in 1915 with the object of co-ordinating and establishing the dye industry, was almost immediately diverted to a large, extent from the purposes for which it was established to the manufacture of explosives, and whether it is due to this reason a$one or to others combined with it, the fact remains that the company has not altogether fulfilled the expectations that were formed at its inception.In the meantime, private enterprise in other directions has considerably developed, and has been the principal factor in combination with the Swiss, in saving the situation so far. One firm in particular, viz., Messrs. Levinstein, Limited, of Manchester, have developed with great rapidity, and have expended large sums in the extensions and developments of their works without so far any financial assistance from the Government, and their output is much the largest of any of the British manufacturers, including British Dyes, and is nearly equal to that of all other British manufacturers put together. As matters have developed, this firm must be reckoned to-day as the most important factor in the British dye industry.
The resources of the private firms are, however, severely limited at present by the operations of the Excess Profits Tax; the necessity of a larger margin of trading capital in consequence of the heavier stocks to be carried at greatly enhanced values; and the greatly increased cost of all extensions and plant. In certain cases practically the whole of the profits made had been utilised in the extension of works, but the margin left after the payment of Excess Profits Duty is not sufficient to provide for the needs of the trade, and the&apos;uncertainty of the outlook for the future and the absence of any security against German competition make the acquisition of fresh capital impossible.In these circumstances it would appear that in some important respects further development may come to a standstill.The vital importance of this industry, both in its character as the key industry upon which one of our greatest exporting trades depends, and as an economic weapon in peace negotiations and after-war policy, has been recognised in full, and the provision of the means for its successful establishment should no longer be delayed.The various methods hitherto suggested do not appear to provide a solution.The industry is of a highly technical character and the personal element to a large extent governs it. Its peculiar dependence in this country on a few experts, and on special knowledge and secret processes, creates a problem that can only be dealt with by special treatment.In Germany it has resulted in a system carefully built up over a period of thirty or forty years by systematic and scientific selection, and the creation of a highly specialised personnel, whose training and organisation has been the object of Government care and support. In this country, on the other hand, the trained technical knowledge required is rare, and is not very anienable to control.It would appear from the experience now gained that any form of voluntary combination or amalgamation, or even working arrangement, is not feasible, and as a combination under State control is not considered desirable, it is submitted that the problem can for the present be best dealt with&quot; through the direct enoourage-ment of private enterprise by means of financial aid in the form of capital advances and grants, to assist developments and extensions and to promote research, but subject to conditions to be imposed by the Board for the regulation of such develop-ments and extensions; for the limitation of profits for certain periods and the repayment of advances, and for such other matters as may be found necessary and desirable, and including the respective quantities and kinds of dye-stuffs to be manufactured.It is also recommended as an essential accompaniment to any scheme that may be adopted, that some effective assurance must be given that the importation of dyes into this country shall be prohibited except under licence for a considerable period after the war.It is proposed that the financial aid should take the form of (a.) Advances on loan at rates of interest not less than 1 per cent, above Bank rate, with a minimum of 5 per cent.(&amp;.) Contributions in advance in aid of extensions of plant and buildings to compensate for their increased cost above the normal and for special depreciation or obsolescence due thereto, or for other special reasons, subject, however, to the repayment of the whole or any portion of such increased cost as may be recovered from the Inland Revenue as a reduc-tion of Excess Profits Duty due to any allowance made on account of such special depreciation or obsolescence. Contributions under this head may also be retrospective for a certain period.(c) Grants in aid of research.The total amounts of such advances or grants to be authorised for a period of three years from the 1st January, 1918, and including any retrospective grants not to exceed (say)--  (a.)    ... ... ... 1,250,000(&amp;.-)    ...... ... 600,000(c)    ... ... ... 150,000 2,000,000[147] ; -
The conditions to be imposed by the Board under which such advances or grants are to be made will need very careful consideration, and the Board of Trade do not wish to be strictly bound by the following tentative suggestions, which will probably need modification in the light of experience j 1. That no advance on loan is to be made exceeding 50 per cent, of the valueof the assets of the firm concerned, to be ascertained by an accountantappointed by the Board. 2. That no company receiving either a loan or grant shall pay a dividend ordistribute profits of more than 9 per cent, upon the amount of its -effectivecapital as ascertained by the accountant, until the conditions of theloan or grant are fulfilled. 3. That before any dividend is paid or any profit distributed provision shallbe made for a sinking fund to secure the repayment of the loan in aperiod not exceeding 20 years. 4. That 50 per cent, of any surplus profits after 9 per cent, has been earned onthe effective capital of the company shall be paid to the Government inpart repayment of the loan. 5. That the loan or grant is made subject to the company conforming to Boardof Trade requirements as regards the manufacture and output of dyes.It has further to be pointed out (1) that no scheme for the establishment of the dye industry can be of any effect unless and until the industry is also fully recognised as having the same status as munitions of war, and as such is to be accorded the same priority for the material and labour required for the extension and maintenance of works; (2) that as the supply of sufficient chemists and chemical engineers is an absolute necessity, both for the present maintenance of the industry and for its future development, it is necessary. &apos;(a.) That chemists and chemical engineers at present employed in dye manu-facturing works shall be exempt from military service;(&amp;.) That in order to provide a supply of chemists for the future, chemistry students in the universities who are being trained bond fide with the object of becoming research chemists shall be exempt from military service;(c.) That on application of the Board of Trade any trained chemists at present in the Army shall be allowed to return to civil life for the purpose of their profession in dye works, to make up any deficiencies in the equip-ment of the industry at the present time, and to provide for the effective equipment of new and intended works.Board of Trade,December 5, 1917.APPENDIX II.Historical Survey of the British Synthetic Dye Industry, prepared by the Boardof Trade.The manufacture of synthetic dyes is by far the most important and character-istic of the key industries, the control of which had been gradually allowed to fall into the hands of our present enemies, and the recovery of which is essential to our economic welfare during the period of reconstruction.The outbreak of the present war revealed in a striking manner the extent of our dependence on Germany for our supplies of dye-stuffs. In 1913 the last year before the war we imported 18,000 tons of synthetic dye-stuffs, valued at 1,890,000Z., and of these about 90 per cent, came from Germany, and the remainder from Switzerland. The importance of these dye-stuffs is to be judged not so much by their intrinsic value, but by that of the finished products of which they formed an indispensable constituent. In this connection it is estimated that at least 80,000,000Z. of dyed textiles alone were exported annually from this country; and when the value of all other exported commodities into which dyes enter in some form or other, as well as the vast home trade, is taken into consideration, some conception is obtained of the enormous importance of dyes to the national well-being and prosperity.
In addition to the imports referred to above, home manufacturers produced colours to about 10 per cent, of our total requirements, but it should not be over-looked that even this small percentage of production was mainly non-competitive, and was controlled or tolerated by the Germans upon conditions which practically made British-dye manufacturers tributary dependents of the great German industry.The position, therefore, at the outbreak of war was most serious. Stocks were comparatively small owing to changing fashion and the ease with which in the past colours had been obtained from Germany. The British dye industry, as such, was virtually non-existent, and such manufacturers as were engaged in the industry were not equipped, either technically or in respect of plant, for more than the pro-duction on a small scale of a limited range of dyes.It was at once recognised that if our great export trade in textiles was not to be placed in a serious position of danger, it would be necessary for the State to give special assistance and encouragement to the manufacture of synthetic dyes in this country, for unless we are in a position immediately the war is over to supply as large and as satisfactory a range of dyed materials as any of our competitors, either we shall be forced to resume our dependence on German dyes or our position in international competition may be very easily prejudiced.The first measure taken was the establishment in March 1915 of a limited company British Dyes, Limited with Government financial assistance.     The scheme adopted by the Government was debated in the House of Commons on two occasions in February and March, 1915, the first debate being before, and the second after, the issue of the prospectus of British Dyes, Limited.   In both debates there was unanimous recognition of the need for some kind of Government action, but there was considerable difference of opinion as to the form which that action should take.   In some quarters it was urged that the absence of any security for the industry after the war would deter the subscription of the large capital necessary for the establishment of the dye-making industry on a sufficiently large scale, and that the necessary security could be given only by a prohibition of the importation of German dye-stuffs for a considerable period, or the establishment of a substantial protective tariff.   If such security were afforded, it was believed that large amounts of capital would be forthcoming both for the Government-aided company and for independent enterprises.   In other quarters,&apos;where the idea of a protective tariff&apos; or prohibition was not acceptable, a number of criticisms were directed against the Government scheme, mostly as to particular points.   A part of the scheme most adversely criticised in the earlier discussion (namely, that subscribers to the company should make with it an exclusive contract for the purchase of dye-stuffs, subject to certain conditions) was withdrawn before the issue of the prospectus.    Some criticism was directed against the finance of the scheme, mainly on the ground that the new company, after the purchase of Messrs. Read, Holliday and Sons&apos; under-taking, would not have sufficient capital to develop on a sufficiently large scale. Other criticisms were based on the assumption that the war would probably be only a short one, and that the Government were devoting their energies to a scheme which could only come to fruition at a distant date, instead&apos; of concentrating on the immediate emergency.   A number of suggestions were made as to subsidiary methods of assisting the industry, e.g., amendment of the Patent Laws and a relaxa-tion of the regulations as to the use of alcohol for industrial purposes, but broadly speaking it may be said that no alternative constructive proposals of a comprehensive character were put forward other than the suggestion as to prohibition of the importation of German dye-stuffs, or a protective tariff, to which reference has been made above.The matter has not since been debated in the House of Commons.It was originally intended that this company, whose basis was a producing association of dye consumers, should amalgamate all the principal manufacturers of dyes in the United Kingdom, but in practice this has been found impossible (the company has been able to acquire the works of only one concern, Read, Holliday and Sons, Huddersfield). The authorised capital of British Dyes, Limited, at its formation was 2,000,000Z., whilst the Government undertook to advance on debenture a sum of 11. for every 11. of ordinary shares capital subscribed, up to 1,000,000Z., and thereafter a further 11. (up to a maximum of 500,000Z.) for each 4Z. of additional share capital subscribed. Thus, if the amounts originally contemplated are eventually subscribed, the company will have a capital of 4,500,000Z., made up of 3,000,000Z. ordinary capital and 1,500,000Z. Government debentures. The latter bear interest at 4 per cent, per annum, and are payable in 25 years, the interest
for the first 5 years being payable only ont of profits, and non-cumulative. The dividend payable is limited to 6 per cent, per annum, so long as any portion of the Government advance is outstanding. The Government also granted to the company a sum of 100,000 . for research purposes, to be paid as and when required, over a period of ten years.Starting with the very limited works of Read, Holliday and Sons, which before the war were a mixing factory rather than a dye manufacturing works, British Dyes have made considerable progress during the last 2% years, but the company has not nearly fulfilled the expectations of the Government as regards the actual production of dyes. This is partly due to the fact that from the outset the company has had to divert its energies to the requisition of the Ministry of Munitions to the manufacture of explosives. The company have erected extensive works, and are still proceeding with their development, but instead of being available for the manufacture of dyes, the greater portion of the works and organisation is devoted to the production of explosives. Concurrently with this, the company have, never-theless, proceeded with the erection of their dye plants, and have manufactured certain of the commoner dyes on a fairly considerable scale, but their output in this respect amounts only to about 4,500 tons per annum, or about one-fourth of the requirements of this country alone, whilst hitherto they have not to any con-siderable extent produced in either quantity or variety the special dyes which are of real importance for the successful establishment of the industry.Meanwhile other companies, without assistance from the Government, have made much progress. The largest and most enterprising of these, namely, Messrs. Levinstein, of Manchester, have been the most important factor in meeting the demands of the dye consumers, and also to a large extent those of our Allies, for naval and military purposes. Messrs. Levinstein&apos;s output is about 7,500 tons of dyes per annum, not including about 1,250 tons of synthetic indigo produced at their Port Ellesmere works,;, which formerly belonged to the German company, Meister, Lucius, and Bruning, Limited, and was sold by order of the Court.Another firm the British Alizarine Co., Ltd., Silvertown, E.-produces only alizarine colours, and has so increased its output as to be able to meet practically the whole home demand for certain alizarine colours, though up to the present it has not been able to engage in any appreciable export trade. It is of the greatest importance that facilities should be extended to this company, which is the only firm outside Germany devoted to the manufacture of alizarine red, which is vital to the colour-using trades. It is understood that in pre-war days the Germans often refused to supply alizarine unless all the other colours required were also obtained from Germany.In addition, there are certain other companies of more or less minor importance which have contributed in varying degrees towards meeting the requirements for dyes, but it is not necessary to enumerate them for the purposes of this memorandum.In spite of the progress recorded above, it must not be overlooked that the bulk of the dyes manufactured in this country are these which are required for war pur-poses, or are those which are sufficient to meet existing demands in the present state of international competition, and very little ground in the manufacture of the special and more difficult dyes has yet been covered. In this connection it might be mentioned that an arrangement was made early on in the war with certain Swiss manufacturers of dyes, whereby they undertook to supply this market with dye-stuffs in exchange for raw materials, and by far the larger proportion of the special dyes required are now being imported from this source. It is estimated that only about 15 per cent, of these dyes are being produced in this country, whilst of the remainder only about 60 per cent, are produced in Switzerland, the balance not being manufactured either here or in Switzerland. There is a strong feeling among dye consumers that in recognition of the services which they have rendered during the war period, special consideration and facilities should be extended to the Swiss manufacturers in any scheme for making. this country independent of German supplies of dyes. It is felt that in view of the long experience which the Swiss have had, and of the fact that they are dependent either on Germany or this country for their supplies of materials, an effort should be made to secure their co-operation with British manufacturers in breaking the German monopoly. From the con-versations with representatives of the Swiss firms who are at present in this country, it would appear that they themselves are-taking steps which will secure this object to some extent.
But even if the assistance of the Swiss manufacturers may be counted upon, there still remains a large margin of important colours and manufactures which it will be necessary to encourage by special means. At present^ international competi-tion is more or less suspended, and the whole world has been compelled to turn increasingly to Great Britain as being the only country which has been able during the war to satisfy its own requirements and to produce a surplus for export, and the demand for special dyes is nothing like so apparent as it will become when normal conditions are restored. At present people both at home and abroad are compelled to accept the limited range of colours available, and the unsatisfactory nature of many of the dyed materials now being supplied is recognised as unavoidable. But such a state of affairs will not long survive the conclusion of hostilities. It is imperative that efforts should now be made which will secure within a very short time the production of a much larger and a more satisfactory range of dyes than has as yet been attempted.About eighteen months ago an effort was made to ascertain the extent to which British manufacturers would probably be able to supply the essential requirements for dyes after the war, and the Board of Trade, at the suggestion of all the parties concerned, convened a Conference consisting of four representatives of the dye manu-facturing industry, and the same number representing the chief consumers, to consider the question. The object of the Conference was not only to endeavour to ascertain the exact requirements of the dye users, and the extent to which the dye-makers could meet them, but also to try and bring about some concentration of effort among the dye-makers themselves, with a view to the prevention of overlapping and the resultant waste of effort. On the first point the Conference was successful in drawing up an agreed schedule of essential dyes, some of which the makers indicated they could produce in sufficient quantity, whilst in the case of others it was admitted that the users would have to depend on foreign sources of supply for a considerable period after the war. The demarcation of production among the makers proved, however, to be a matter of much greater difficulty, and it then appeared that the only effective solution of the problem would be a combination of interests by the fusion of the principal concerns in a single company to co-ordinate all the available technical skill and experience, and utilise each to the best advantage. This view was supported not Only by the dye-makers, but also by the dye consumers, as will be gathered from the following resolution submitted by the Colour Users&apos; Committee at the time: &quot; Resolved that this Committee of Colour Users, whilst gratefully appre-ciating the efforts of the British coloUrmakers to meet their requirements, is of opinion that far greater progress would have been made had all the resources and knowledge in the United Kingdom been co-ordinated to that end, and this Committee therefore urges that immediate steps be taken for securing the fullest and the best use of all such knowledge and resources, by the formation of a company including all existing important British dye-makers, and this Committee further desires most respectfully to represent to His Majesty&apos;s Government that, in the opinion of the Committee, the formation of such a com-pany can only be brought about by Government action.&quot; That the Committee would earnestly urge that, taking into special con-sideration the vital importance to the nation of the colour-making industry, immediate action be taken to form such a company.&quot;This was in some respects the position when the question was considered by the Committee of the Cabinet in October 1916, when it was decided to approve the general, line of action which the Board of Trade Were taking at that time, with a view to promoting a fusion of the chief dye manufacturing concerns, and the steps which it was proposed to take with a view to regulating the import of dyes during the period of reconstruction, and of the principle of affording special measures for the temporary encouragement of the manufacture of the more difficult dyes, also during the reconstruction period.As a result of the Cabinet decision, a small Committee was appointed to consider the practicability of effecting a fusion of the four principal dye maiiufac-f^Tj&apos;-^2&apos;&apos; -B^tis^1 -Dy^&apos; Limited, Levinstein, Limited, Claus and Company, and the British Alizarine Company, Limited, but this Committee was not able to arrive at a unanimous report. The majority, however, reported in favour of an amalgama-tion or fusion of the principal concerns, and as a consequence a scheme for the lusion of British Dyes, Limited, and Messrs. Levinstein, Limited, with provisions
for the inclusion of other concerns if desired, was prepared, based on the following principles: The purchase outright of the existing companies by a new company, having a capital of 5,00Q,000Z. (including the 1,000,000Z. already advanced to British Dyes, Limited, by the Government) the payment to be made in shares of the new company.A co-operative arrangement with the dye consumers, under which they were to subscribe 500,000Z. of the capital of the new company, and were to be entitled as a rebate on their purchases to 50 per cent, of the surplus profits of the company after the payment of a dividend of 7 per cent, on the ordinary shares.A subscription of 250,000Z. of ordinary share capital, and a guarantee by the Government of the dividend on 2,500,000Z. of the capital of the new company, such guarantee to lapse when the company has earned 7 per cent, on the ordinary shares for a period of seven years in consideration of which the liability of the Govern-ment for a further subscription of 700,000Z. and the grant of 100,000Z. to British Dyes was to be terminated.An assurance that for a certain period after the war the importation of dye-stuffs would be prohibited except under licence.A subsidy, if this price of raw materials exceeded a certain fixed standard based on an estimated after-war value, to be repaid out of the profits of the company after 7 per cent, had been paid on the ordinary shares.Government control while the guarantee on the preference capital was in force.The present manager of British Dyes, Limited, and the managing director of Levinstein, Limited, to be managing directors of the new company under specially defined arrangements.This scheme provided for complete co-ordination and concentration of manu-facture and technical skill; security for the capital invested in the respective concerns until they became self-supporting on a commercial basis; the creation of the confidence necessary for progress and development; the encouragement of personal incentive; the gradual extinction of the privileges attached to the period of establish-ment and reconstruction; and the prevention of any evil monopoly effects which other-wise might attach to a company so constituted, by means of Government control and the co-operative arrangements for a return to the consumer of a large share of any surplus profits.The scheme in principle was agreed to both by British Dyes, Limited, and Levinstein, Limited, as providing a basis for amalgamation, but after consultation with representatives of the Treasury, it was not thought desirable to proceed further with the negotiations. It was felt that strong objection would probably be raised in Parliament to what would be described as a privileged monopoly in spite of the provisions in the scheme designed to prevent this.As there was no prospect of any amalgamation of interests being effected by voluntary action on the part of the companies themselves, and the difficulties in the way of a State-aided and controlled amalgamation were realised to be considerable, it was determined to test for awhile the possibilities of the manufacturers them-selves solving the difficulty by working in free competition. The progress already made in many directions gave some considerable hope that such might be the case, and with a view! to lending all possible assistance in this direction the Board established a special Department with a Dyes Commissioner at its head to deal with all questions affecting the industry, and to meet as far as possible the requirements of the industry in such essential matters as the provision of materials, labour, &amp;c. A good deal has been accomplished in this respect, but on the whole no considerable improvement is apparent in the essential character of the development now acquired.From the outset the greatest difficulty has been experienced by the Department in securing the necessary materials for the proper maintenance and development of the industry. The Priority Department of the Ministry of Munitions of War have apparently failed on the whole to realise its great importance, and to accord it different treatment from that meted out to non-war indusries. This, of course, made it practically impossible to secure plant containing any appreciable quantity of steel, and to this extent retarded its progress. Similar difficulties in varying degree were encountered in obtaining certain raw materials, and in the retention of essential men.With a view to obtaining a definite ruling as to the status to be accorded to the industry, the question was referred to the War Cabinet, and it was decided that the
dye industry is to be regarded as a war industry for all purposes. A minute to this effect was recently circulated to the Departments concerned, and provided that this decision is correctly interpreted considerable assistance will no doubt be forth-coming in dealing with questions affecting the supply of materials and labour to the industry.But in the eyes of the dye consumers even these measures are not sufficient to place the industry in a strong position by the end of the war. In the course of lengthy negotiations with the principal consumers, this point has been specially emphasised by tjiem, and they are of opinion that, failing any voluntary co-ordination among the dye manufacturers, steps should be taken by the Government to acquire all the important undertakings by legislation. They also urge that some form of State financial aid should be given, and that efforts should be made to secure the co-operation of the Swiss manufacturers.The present position, however, is more particularly dealt with in the accompanying Memorandum.Board of Trade,December 5, 1917.
