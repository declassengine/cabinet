[This Document is the Property of His Britank Maje&amp;ty!s Ge.76naaafifc.j     5 UPrinted for the War Cabinet.  October 1917.SECRET, G.- 165.LEGALITY OF CERTAIN ACTS DONE UNDER THE DEFENCE OF THEREALM REGULATIONS.Opinion of Law Officers of the Crown, rendered in accordance with War Cabinet244, Minute 1,(Previous Paper No. G.T.-2133.)OUR attention has been directed to a memorandum by Lord Rhondda calling attention to a recent decision of the High Court as to the effect of the Orders under which beans had been requisitioned, and stating the alternatives which were before him as a consequence of such decision.Upon considering the terms of the memorandum it appears to us in the first place that Lord Rhondda does not clearly indicate what in his view is the effect of the decision, and it is possible that he may have prepared his memorandum upon a wider construction of the declaration made by the Judge who decided the case than the true one.It is therefore necessary to examine the effect of the decision upon the Orders in question.There are two Orders as to beans. The first (dated the 1st May, 1917) requisitions Burmah &quot;peas and beans, and the second (dated the 17th May, 1917) requisitions all other kinds of beans, peas, and pulse suitable for human food. Only the second Order was before the Court, though no doubt the decision would apply to the former Order, which is in similar terms.Both profess to be made under Defence of the Realm Regulations 2f, and must therefore comply with the terms of that Regulation, which authorises the Food Controller &quot; to require all or any persons owning or having power to sell or dispose of any article or any stocks thereof &quot; to place the same at his &quot;disposal.The Order of the 17th May, 1917, requires, &quot; all persons owning or having power to sell or dispose of any beans, peas, or pulse, suitable for human food which have arrived .... or shall hereafter arrive &quot; (with an exception which is not material for the present purpose) to place the same at the disposal of the Food ! Controller. These goods are &quot; taken over from the original consignees &quot; and all contracts made by the original consignees or any persons claiming under them are cancelled, and buyers and sellers are released from the obligation of paying brokerage.The case of./. Hindhaugh &amp; Co. v. Attorney General came before Rowlatt, J., on the 30th July, 1917. The validity of the Regulation, under which the Order was made, and of the first paragraph of the Order, which requisitions the beans, &amp;c, was not in effect challenged by the Plaintiffs, who were the original consignees. What they did claim was that under the particular circumstances they were not &quot; persons owning or having power to sell or dispose of &quot; the goods in question, and consequently no Order made under the Regulation could effect them.At the date of the Order, the goods imported by them were still afloat, but the shipping documents had arrived and been duly taken up by the Plaintiffs, who had in turn transferred them to their purchasers. Consequently at that date the Plaintiffs had fulfilled all the obligations imposed upon them by their contracts; those contracts had ceased to exist, and the Plaintiffs no longer owned or had any power to sell or dispose of the goods.The Regulation is not retrospective, nor does it authorise any Order made under it to have any retrospective effect, and consequently no Order could validly be made which would be binding upon the Plaintiffs,&quot; and so far as the Order purported to impose any duty upon them it was invalid.The decision, therefore, only applies to the case of goods afloat at the date of the Order, the importers of which have completed their contracts. It does not prevent the Food Controller obtaining the goods, but he must do so from the persons[1080]
who have an interest in them at that date. All contracts then open can be annulled, but it follows that, for a short time after the making of an Order in these terms, the Food Controller may be prevented from seizing them in the hands of the original consignees and be forced to deal with some person who comes later in the chain of transactions with regard to a particular consignment or consignments.The difficulty caused by the decision is a temporary one, and the question whether steps should be taken to deal with it depends largely upon whether the amount involved is so large as to make it desirable or necessary.The above question merely turns upon the validity of part of an Order made under a Regulation, and is of less importance than the much larger issue raised by the War1 Cabinet, viz., the legality of acts done under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, which we now proceed to consider.This raises the whole question as to the Prerogative of the Crown in relation to private rights of property during times of war.We therefore think it advisable, especially in view of the fact that further legislation on the subject has been mooted, to place upon record our view as to the present law governing the subject.We would preface our remarks by pointing out that, owing to the fact that the circumstances of war in the present day are so totally different from what they were in former days, and to the further fact that in the great wars of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the position of the dynasty made it obviously desirable to rely upon statute rather than upon the Prerogative, there is room for difference of opinion both as to the circumstances that must exist in order to give rise to an occasion when the Prerogative is exercisable, and also as to the effect of its exercise when such an occasion has arisen.It is a remarkable fact that so far as we are aware no case is to be found in the books in which, before the present war, a subject whose land or other private property had been taken in time of war for use for the purposes of the defence cof the Realm has taken proceedings against the Crown either for compensation or for a declaration that the taking was illegal.So far as case law therefore is concerned the authority for the Prerogative has to be collected from dicta by judges in cases in which the nature and extent of the Prerogative has been referred to. The main authorities of this class are the Saltpetre Case and the Case of Shipmoney.On the assumption that the dicta in these and similar cases correctly state the law, the conclusion follows that the Prerogative of the Crown in time of war extends to justify every interference with private rights of property which may be necessary for the public safety and defence of the Realm.We think that the above assumption may safely be made, for in none of the arguments which have taken place on the question of the Prerogative has the law, as so laid down, been challenged. It is also consistent with the view adopted by Parliament in affirming that &quot;His Majesty in Council has power during the continu-ance of the present war to issue Regulations for the public safety and defence of the Realm.&quot; The Defence of the Realm Consolidation Act 1914, therefore, does not profess to confer the power, but to recognise and confirm such power as a part of the Prerogative of the Crown.The difficulties that have arisen concern the application of the principle to particular cases.To deal first with the case of the user of land. No one doubts that if a hostile force were actually marching across England the Prerogative would enable the armed forces of the Crown to march across the lands of private owners in order to attack the enemy, to construct defensive works of all kinds, and to destroy buildings and other property on such land which might be of use to the enemy or a hindrance to our forces. But from such state of facts, to such a case as the requisitioning of a set of offices for the more convenient or efficient housing of clerks in a Government Department, more or less directly connected with some matter of administration con-nected with the war, the urgency of the necessity for the acquisition of any property for the purpose, and also for the acquisition of the particular property in question, alters, in an ever-diminishing degree, until at last the taking of property, under the exercise of Prerogative power, appears to be a very harsh proceeding.It is upon this line that the argument against the Prerogative has mostly been laid. It is said that to give rise to an occasion when the Prerogative becomes opera-tive in law, there must be a necessity of so urgent a character that no other means (if there is any) of acquiring the use of the land, apart from the Prerogative, will
enable the use of it to be acquired in time. Thus it is argued that, where there is time to put the Defence Act 1842 into operation, no occasion can arise for the acquisition of the use of land under the Prerogative, and this argument is, to a certain extent, supported by the wording of the Defence Acts themselves.Another line of argument is that the Prerogative has been taken away by Statute or has been allowed to lapse and been replaced by Statute, and here again the Defence Acts and the legislation during the French Wars are relied upon.In all the cases hitherto decided by the Courts these arguments have been over-ruled, but they undoubtedly impressed the three Law Lords before whom the Brighton-Shoreham Aerodrome Case was partly argued. (In that case, and in the cases which have occurred since, the Crown relied alternatively upon the Regula-tions made under the Defence of the Realm Acts. These Regulations were held by some of the judges, who decided in favour of the Crown, to give the requisite power, apart from the Prerogative, as to which they expressed no opinion. The Acts and the Regulations thereunder do not, in our view, carry the powers of the Crown any further than the Prerogative, though they afford a useful alternative ground on which to rely for the power to acquire the use of land.).The next question which arises is the effect upon the rights of the subject of the acquisition of the use of his land. We think there can be no doubt that if the land is acquired under the Prerogative, no compensation is by law payable in respect of its use. The same result should logically follow from an acquisition under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.It is to be observed, however, that while the Prerogative was established during an age when compensation for such matters was undreamed of, the Acts and Regulations have been passed at a time when the principle of compensation for the compulsory acquisition of land has been firmly established; and, though no doubt the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission was intended to assess ex gratia com-pensation, the ideas of persons concerned with such matters had been formed under the more liberal regime of the Lands Clauses Acts, and they consequently desired the rights conferred by such Acts rather than the much less liberal allowances made by the Commission. Even the draftsmen of the Acts had the principle of compensation in their minds, for, though the Defence of the Realm Amendment (No. 3) Act 1915 (which established liquor control) was not intended to give legal rights, but to leave compensation to be assessed ex gratia; the use in the Act of the words &quot; com-pulsorily or by agreement &quot; has led to a decision in the Cannon Brewery Case (now under appeal, but unlikely, in our view, to be overruled), that there is an implied incorporation of the Lands Clauses Acts, with the consequence that compensation would be due as of right on Land Clauses principles.To sum up the question of the user of land, we would point out that the law as laid down in the Brighton-Shoreham Case has been adopted unanimously by all the Judges who have been called upon to pronounce judgment upon the point. It must be acknowledged that there are formidable arguments for a contrary view, and we are not prepared to say with any certainty that the House of Lords would uphold that decision.Since the argument in that case there have been matters, such as the decision of the House of Lords in Zadig&apos;s Case and the making of the Regulations for Food Forage and Coal Control, which have been accepted as being within the Rule making power recognised by the Defence of the Realm Acts, and perhaps make it easier to support the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The Defence of the Realm (Acquisi-tion of Land) Act 1916 (which provides for the means and the terms by and on which possession of land acquired under the Prerogative or the Regulations during the war may be continued in time of peace) may also be used as an additional argument in support.The question of compensation also arises in connection with the various pro-visions for compensation contained in a number of the Regulations, as for example in the Food Control Regulations. If these are to be regarded as modifications of a prerogative right to take without compensation, then no doubt their validity cannot be impeached; but if the true view is that the subject has a legal right to compensa-tion on different principles,&apos; then their validity is open to grave question.Another difficulty that may arise is to be found in the development of the scope of the Regulations made under the Defence of the Realm Acts. Thus, when it became necessary to deal with liquor control an amending Act was passed to enable Regulations to be made upon that subject.    Presumably, but not necessarily, the
view was adopted that the original Act. in spite of its wide terms, did not authorise such Regulations. It is of course also open to be argued that Parliament in passing the original.Act did not abrogate its functions, and that the passing of the amending Act does not therefore justify the argument that the original Act was not sufficiently wide.When, however, it was decided to establish a form of food control, this was carried out by means of Regulations made under the original ActThere are now a number of Regulations which can only be justified by a series of deductions, for example, Regulation 41, as amended on 30th March, 1917, or the Regulation 2s which shortens the period during which stray dogs are to be kept (apparently intended to conserve the food supply). Some are apparently to be justified as tending to administrative convenience. Others again, such as the Regulation made on 29th September, 1917, alter Emergency Legislation passed by Parliament. It is a strong measure to provide that in a munition area a landlord may be liable criminally not for ejecting a munition worker who is paying his rent, but for bringing proceedings in order to enforce rights recognised by the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest Act 1915. Such Regulations may not be invalid, but in the form adopted may be resented by persons affected who may in no sense be disloyal or desirous of hampering the administration and thereby tend to diminish the respect due to &quot;the more important Regulations.It is difficult for us to discuss the question of illegal acts under the Regulations in general without specific instances of alleged illegalities. It is, of course, possible or even probable that officials charged with the administration of these Regulations may do acts which are within their powers but which are prompted by indirect motives. In such a case the Lord Chief Justice, in delivering judgment in the Duke of Chateau Thierry&apos;s Case, intimated that the Courts would interfere, and accordingly the Divisional Court granted a writ of habeas corpus, although the order made by the Home Secretary was authorised by Regulation 14b. This decision was, however, upset by the Court of Appeal.On the other hand, Atkin, J., in delivering judgment in Lift on v. Ford uphold-ing the validity of Regulation. 2b suggested that in such a case the order would be a valid exercise of the power, and that the only remedy of the subject was to take the appropriate proceedings against the official whose conduct was impugned.We have seen the draft of a Bill designed to remove the doubt which exists as to the right of compensation for taking land under the Prerogative. The chief objec-tion to the Bill is that it gives a legal right to compensation for takings both past and future in language which, though it has been construed in a restricted sense by the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission (see the First Report of that Commis-sion), is capable of receiving a much wider construction in a Court of Law. If the Bill were passed any claimant might apply to the Court for a mandamus to give compensation on the wider construction of the statute, with alarming consequences. There is also no time-limit within which claims are to be made. If any legislation is to be passed we think that it should be on the lines suggested by the late Lord Chancellor rather than on the lines of the draft Bill.The question of the payment of compensation for the user of land is probably more urgent than for any other user of property, but the importance of the question lies in the fact that the powers of the Crown to acquire the use of land without compensation are certainly not greater at common law than its powers to take possession of food and consumable materials. Indeed, the Prerogative of Purveyance has been abolished by Statute. The effect is that if the Prerogative or the Regula-tions do not permit the acquisition of the use of land without a legal right of compensation, they cannot authorise the taking of ships, lood, forage, or coal without a like right arising, and consequently if compensation in the case of land is to be measured by market value, as distinguished from the actual loss of the person dispossessed, the same rule must apply to goods and chattels, and, as pointed out above, the provisions which direct the assessment of compensation upon any less favourable basis are all ultra vires,FREDERICK SMITH.
