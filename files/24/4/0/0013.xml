rnph-iq Barnment is the Property of His Britonse Ha,jesty&apos;s -GovermasnLjPrinted for the War Cabinet   October 1917.SECRET. G-163-REORGANISATION OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.Memorandum by Sir Albert Stanley and Report op a Committee appointed to Consider the Question of the Reorganisation of the Board of Trade.AFTER the war much greater demands than heretofore will be made upon the Board of Trade by the commercial and manufacturing interests of the country for guidance and help,&quot; and it is essential that, steps should be taken to secure greater Governmental vigilance and initiative with a view to the maintenance of our &quot;commercial and industrial position.So far as relates to Commercial Intelligence, the position will, I hope, be adequately met by the new organisation which is now- being set up jointly by the Board of Trade and Foreign Office. But this only covers a comparatively small part of the whole ground. There is a widespread demand for a strengthening of the Board of Trade in other directions, and I accordingly invited a small informal Committee, consisting of Sir Clarendon Hyde, Sir A. F. Firth, Bart., Mr. H. J. Mackinder, M.P., and Mr. C. T. Needham, M.P., to assist me by making enquiry into the organisation of the Board of Trade, and by framing proposals for such changes and developments of that organisation as they might think necessary to increase the efficiency of the Board and adapt it for meetino- the groivinjj demands which will be m ;de upon it in the future.The Committee have presented a Report which is annexed to this Memorandum. Subject to certain modifications in detad, I am in general agreement with the Committee&apos;s recommendations, and as it&apos; is in my judgment of the greatest importance that the Department should be ready and equipped to meet its new responsibilities immediately on the termination of the war, and sh mid be in a position to make adequate preparations to that end, I propose&quot; to take immediate steps to put the scheme into operation, at least in its main outlines.The following are the principal features of the scheme : 1. The work of the Board of Trade to be organised in two main divisions dealing respectively with (a.) Commerce and Industry ; and (b.) Public Services and Control.The Division of Commerce and Industry will be entirely concerned with the develop-ment of trade, with vigilance, with suggestion, with information, and with the duty of thinking out and assisting national, commercial, and industrial policy. The Public Services and Control Division will be primarily engaged in the exercise of statutory and other regulative functions now or in the future entrusted to the Board of Trade. It will therefore include the present Harbour, Marine, Railways, Companies, and Bank-ruptcy Departments, and possibly also the Patent Office.&apos;:i:&quot; Each division will be in charge of a Joint Permanent Secretary, but the Permanent Secretary in charge of the Commerce and Industry Division will rank as senior.2. For tiie purpose of determining questions of policy arising in either division or affecting both divisions, there will be regular meetings of the. President, the two Joint ermanent becretaries, and the Parliamentary Secretary, who will thus constitute an effective working Board.3. The Commerce and Industry Division will be concerned with a great number and variety of matters, and will accordingly be divided into a number of sections or departments.   Each of these sections will be in charge of an officer of Assistant* I have not yet finally determined on which side the Patent Office shall be. [1067] B
Secretary rank (termed &quot;Directors&quot; in the Report), but the organisation will be kept as flexible as possible, and the heads of the various sections will be in constant consulta-tion with each other, and, so far as possible, will be interchangeable. An important feature of the scheme is that there should be one or more &quot; Directors &quot; in excess of the number of sections, so as to provide for special investigations and missions, &amp;c. 4. The first sections to be organised will be for : -(a!) Industrial Development. A new department, dealing with home industries, with special reference to their development and stabdity, production, and the economic strength of the country generally; with questions of policy connected with trade monopolies and combinations, alien penetration into British industries, and the promotion of new trades. (This section will deal with matters within the scope of the Board of Trade relating to industrial reconstruction.)(b.) Overseas Commerce ithe present &quot;Commercial Department&quot;), including such matters as commercial treaties and agreements, foreign and Dominion tariffs and teide regulations, and all other matters within the scope of the Board of Trade relating to the protection and furtherance of British commercial and shipping interests in foreign countries and other parts of the Empire.(c.) Commercial and Industrial Information. This proposed section will, in fact, be the new Department of Commercial Intelligence which is being set up under the arsangements recently concluded between the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office.(d.) Industrial Power and Transport is a new and very important section, charged with the consideration of all questions of general policy relating to transport in its commercial aspect, including shipping, canal, and railway rates and facilities, through railway and ocean routes, shipping conferences, &amp;c. It will also deal with questions of policy relating to industrial power, including the generation and distribution of electricity, gas and water power for industrial purposes, the conservation of fuel, &amp;c.(e.) Statistical Section. This will consolidate and centralise the wrork of the present Census of Production Office and the various other sections at present charged with the preparation of the many Statistical Returns issued by the Board of Trade.f). There will be a strong Advisory Council thoroughly representative of the commercial and trading interests of the country.6. There wdl be certain consequential changes and regroupings in the ca^e of the departments which fall within the &quot; Public Control &quot; Division, but none of these raise any general question of policy.7. The arrangements thus outlined will involve certain additions to the higher ranks of the staff of the Board of Trade, and an increase in personnel in some directions. I am convinced that the organisation which I now propose will result in the greatly iucreised efficiency of the Department, and will be cordially welcomed bv the commercial and industrial community, and I therefore propose to cany the proposed arrangements, into effect forthwith, so far as it is possible to do so during the war, in order to be fully equipped to meet the post-war needs of British commerce and industry.A. H. STANLEY.Board of Trade, October 30, 1917.Report of a Committee appointed to consider the Question of the Reorganisation ofthe Board of Trade.The Right Honourable Sir Albert Stanley, M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,1. In accordance with- the duty imposed upon us by you, we have undertaken a confidential examination of the commercial side of the Board of Trade with a view to the framing of proposals as to measures for strengthening the Government machinery for dealing with trade questions and adapting it to meet the larger demands which will in the future be made upon it in respect of the ever-growing needs of British commerce and industry.
an2. We have had the advantage of hearing the views of the Permanent Secretaryi d of the Second Secretary, the Assistant Secretary in charge of the Commercial Department and the Comptroller-General of the Commercial Intelligence Department, whilst additional information has been furnished to us by Mr. Ashley- Further, in order that we might have a complete view of the present activities of the Board of Trade and the nature of its work, we have thought it advantageous to consult with the Assistant Secretaries having charge of the Harbour, Marine, an I Railway Depart-ments, the Comptroller of the Companies Department, the Comptroller-General of Patents, the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, and the Director of the Census of Production.3. It was apparent at once that the Board of Trade has in the past not considered the promotion or assistance of home trade to be one of its main functions, its com-mercial side was chiefly devoted to the assistance of British trade abroad by the collection and dissemination of information, the collection and publication of foreign trade statistics, the advising of the Foreign Office in respect of commercial treaties and other international agreements, and to dealing with the individual compLunts of traders carrying on business abroad, and their rectification, where possible, through the medium of the Foreign Office. But it appears to us obvious that British trade in the future will require many more services from the Board of Trade than it has been accustomed to receive in the past. The demand for a separate Ministry of Commerce and Industry has, we think, been largely due to the absence from the Board of Trade of any Department which was directly charged with the safeguarding and development of home trad^, with vigilance as to the inroads of foreign manufacturers on British markets, and with watching for gaps in the chain of British manufactures. There has also been obviously a lack of any home policy with respect to a large number of trade matters which will be more or less indicated in this report.4. The Board of Trade will naturally be primarily interested in trade questions from the point of view of the producer, manufacturer, and distributor ; on the other hand, it should not overlook the interests of the home purchaser and consumer, and in this respect should exercise functions altogether distinct from those of the various trade associations throughout the country. Each trade association is necessarily prone to regard trade questions from the point of view of its own trade to the exclusion often of all outside considerations. It will be the duty of the Board of Trade to look upon all trade questions as a whole, and regard them from the standpoint of national interests.5. A great many functions discharged by the Board of Trade at the present time are regulative only. The Harbour, Marine, Railway Companies and Bankruptcy Departments and the Patent Office are occupied to a predominant extent and in some cases almost exclusively with the discharge of certain statutory duties and the adminis-tration of detailed legislative enactments. They have in some respects considerable discretionary powers, and we recognise that from time to time questions of policy in which those departments are largely concerned do arise. The heads of those depart-menls must, with regard to matters coming within their scope, be advisers of the Board on questions of policy, but whilst we are quite alive to the symmetrical advantage of treating each subject comprehensively by itself, so that policy and administration may go hand in hand, we believe that to leave questions of policy entirely, or even mainly, to these departments would lead to a certain amount of suspicion on the part of traders that control was aimed at, and would largely restrict the authority and influence of the Board.6. For whilst the function of the Board on its commercial side will be to act as a friendly adviser of British trade and to take an active interest in everything that promotes or develops the commerce of the United Kingdom, we feel bound to enter a warning against any attempt to establish a bureaucratic control of the operations of British traders and manufacturers. Any such attempt must in our judgment not only be doomed to failure, but exercise a detrimental effect on British trade.For this reason we think it is essential that the commercial side of the Board of Trade, which will be concerned with the promotion and development of British commerce and industry, should be kept as separate and distinct as possible from the regulative and administrative departments, that is, those which are principally concerned, as we have said, with the discharge of statutory duties. In sayiny this, howevt r, we wish to make it quite clear that the work done by those departments in the past appears to us to have been valuable and necessary, and it does not seem that any such work should be discontinued in the future. On the contrary, the departments in question should, where they require it, be strengthened ; and in particular we think that
f v.     -the heads of those departments, though responsible for the administrative work, should have the services of such numbers of principal clerks as may be necessary to prevent actual Ministerial work devolving unduly upon them, so that they may be in a position to devote all the time that may be necessary to advising the commercial side of the Board on all questions of policy, where their practical experience should prove of the greatest value.7. For the purpose of securing the division of functions which we advocate, whilst at the same time securing joint consideration of all the questions affecting both sides of the work of the Board- and maintaining unity of direction, we have come to the conclusion that the Board should be divided into two main divisions: (1.) A division of Commerce and Industry, which would be entirely concerned with the development of trade, with vigilance, with suggestion, with information, and with the duty of thinking out, unifying, and assisting national, commercial, and industrial policy ; and(2.) A division of Public Services and Control, which would be primarily engaged in the exercise of statutory regulative functions now or in future entrusted to the Board of Trade. In this division we should include the present Harbour Department, possibly with some change of name (such as the &quot; Public Utilities Department &quot;j, which would better indicate its scope, the Marine Department, the Railway Department, the Companies Department, the Bankruptcy Department, and the Patent Office.8. As regards the Patent Office, the Comptroller-General of Patents is entrusted by statute with considerable powers of a judicial nature, and is also the expert adviser of the Board of Trade on questions of Industrial Property. But whilst the Comptroller-General himself thus occupies a special position, by far the greater part of the work of the Patent Office is of an administrative character, and we are of opinion that the Office should be placed in the Public Services and Control Division, though the Comptroller-General would remain the principal expert adviser of the Board, and be constantly consulted on questions of policy.9. From a logical point of view, it seems inconsistent that the safety of railway-men, sailors, and pa-sengers should be entrusted to the Board of Trade, whilst the safety of miners and operatives is in charge of the Home Office. We recognise, however, that logic does not enter into the consideration, and that both Ministries can be indifferently charged by Parliament with like if non-competitive functions. The advisability of regrouping the analogous work of the Board and other Ministries forms no part of our reference.10.. For the purpose of carrying out the duties of the Board as thus divided, it appears to us to be eminently desirable that the present office of Permanent Secretary should be converted into two Joint Permanent Secretaries, one for each division, the intent;on being that whilst each Joint Secretary should be primarily concerned with the work of his own division with definitely delegated authority and responsibility in respect of it, he would nevertheless be acquainted with and equally responsible for the work of the other division, for it is essential that, however much the various depart-ments are nominally separated, they should in the minds of the Secretaries, be considered as parts of a complete organised whole. Each Secretary will, of course, have free access to the President, but we think that the Permanent Secretary in charge of the Commerce and Industry Division should rank by courtesy as the senior official.11. We have considered the advisability of interpolating a Permanent Vice-President of the Board of Trade, whose functions would be to exercise a general supervision and see that the decisions of the President were carried out, but who should not be responsible for the actual conduct of either division. There seems, however, no real opening for such an official, and it is possible that he would find himself without sufficient occupation except during the interregnum caused by change of President or during the absence of the President for any reason. There is the further disadvantage that a Vice-President of strong personality, with insufficient work, would tend too often to become, as a senior official, one to whom the Permanent Secretaries would refer matters for decision, and who would be regarded by them as a responsible chief. The result would be that the present system by which much of the weight of the Board of Trade is con-centrated on one man would be re-established. The objective to be had in view is to increase the number of responsible officials answerable directly to the President. The interposition of a .Vice-President or of a third Permanent Secretary without definitely assigned duties acting as the Presidents right-hand man, would, we believe, weaken the responsibility of the two Permanent Secretaries, and tend to give rise to jealousy
and friction. We, therefore, cannot recommend either of these appointments, though their convenience from some points of view is obvious.12. Questions of policy may originate either within or without the divisions. But such questions should usually be examined by the divisions or departments concerned, and should then come up for discussion at a meeting of the President, the two Permanent Secretaries, and the Parliamentary Secretary, who would call into consulta-tion the heads of the various departments, both advisory and administrative, and any other persons whose opinion they may think likely to be of use. This would seem to provide the best means of arriving at a correct and well-informed solution, the final decision of course remaining with the President himself.In the absence of the President we think the Parliamentary Secretary should preside, both at these meetings and also at the meetings of the Advisory Council, referred to later in this Report. If it were possible for the President to have some voice in the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary, we should regard it as a distinct advantage.13. We do not think it necessary to make any further suggestions as to the depart-ments whose main concern is the exercise of the regulative powers and duties of the Board, and we proceed to discuss the organisation of the Division of Commerce and Industry. That division will be concerned with a very great number and variety of matters, and whilst we recognise that it will be necessary for the carrying on of its work for those subjects to be divided into various sections, we regard it as of great importance that the organisation of the division should be as flexible as possible, and that every effort should be made to secure that any such grouping as may from time to time be adopted shall not become stereotyped. For this purpose what we should wish to see is the appointment of a number of officials to be called Directors of a standing corresponding to that of the Assistant Secretaries in charge of the departments on the Public Services and Control side, to whom groups of matters would be referred by the head of the division from time to time, but who would not regard themselves or be regarded as assigned permanently to the charge of those groups, and should be readily interchangeable. The number should not be fixed, but should be capable of temporary or permanent increase, according to the changing needs of the department. Provision should be made for filling a proportion of these posts from outside the Civil Service.14. It is in our opinion very desirable that the officials whom we have styled Directors should be enabled to make frequent visits to the chief centres of commerce and industry, and to attend meetings of representative Chambers of Commerce and Trade Associations, and should also go abroad from time to time on special missions. This would widen their knowledge and experience, and also give them that personal acquaintance with manufacturers and merchants which we think is essential if the Department is to command the general confidence of the trading community. In order to allow of Directors being seconded for foreign visits, and for the purpose of the investigation of special economic problems from time to time, it would, in our opinion, be advisable to appoint a small number of Directors in excess of the number actually required by the grouping of the matters dealt with in the Commerce and Industry Division, these &apos;: free &quot; Directors being utilised both for special work and for taking the places of any of their colleagues detached for special duty.15. As there will be a number of these Directors, it would probably be advisable that, say, two of them should rank as senior and act as assistants to the Joint Permanent-Secretary in charge of the division; but just as we think that there should be no-stereotyping of the matters entrusted to the various Directors, so we are of opinion that there should be no stereotyped division of work between the two assistants to the Joint Permanent Secretary,, and that the functions discharged by each should be variable, and in fact be varied from time to time. It will he necessary, in order to enlist and retain the confidence of the trader, that certain Directors should be assigned for limited fixed periods to each section within the division so that the trader may know and have confidence in the Director whom he comes to consult. The relative co-Director assigned as under-study to one or more particular groups of subjects should take every opportunity to form the acquaintance of the trader when he calls on business, so that the transfer of the Director to other work, or his absence on the business of his section, would permit his co-Director to take on his work either as successor or in charge without disturbing outside relations.16. Subject to these main principles, we proceed to outline the work which we think might betaken by the Commerce and Industry Division, indicating the sections into which it might, in the first instance, be organised. These sections would naturally be added to or varied from time to time.L1067] C
(1.) Industrial Development and Business Organisation, To this section would be allotted, in the first instance, all subjects which do not naturally fall into one or other of the sections named below. It would from time to time divest itself of any growing subject by constituting a fresh section. The subjects with which it should deal at the outset would include ad enquiries into the state of the industries of the country, with special reference to their development and stability, production, imports, and exports, and the economic strength of the country generally. Amongst the matters to be dealt with will be questions of policy connected with trade monopolies and combinations, their organisation, conduct, and. management; State action as to alien penetration into British industries ; investigation into the state of key industries and other industries essential to the national safety and for the security of trade; questions of policy as to the promotion of new trades; questions in connection with such matters as the conservation of the mineral resources of the country, cotton growing within the Empire and the supplies of other raw materials for which this country is dependent on imports rubber, timber, wool, jute, tin and other metals; the improvement of the classification of imports and exports both in this country and the Dominions; questions of policy (domestic and international) relating to Industrial Property (Patents, Trade-marks, Designs, Copyright, and Merchandise Marks), including the harmonising of the Empire Laws in relation to such matters.The work of this group would be of very great importance and would need a larger number of Directors than any other section.(2.) Overseas Commerce. This would include the work of the present Commercial Department; such matters as commercial treaties and agreements, foreign and Dominion tariffs, and trade regulations, and all other matters affecting British, commercial, industrial, and shipping interests abroad, in respect of which the Board will play an increasingly important part as adviser of the Foreign, India, and Colonial Offices. Included in its work should be the watching and reporting upon the effect of dumping and of any anti-dumping legislation.(3.) Commercial and Industrial Information. This would include the work of the present Department of Commercial Intelligence, namely, the collection and distribution of trade information both at home and abroad, the supervision of the work of trade commissioners, and correspondence with consuls and other official commercial representatives in foreign countries. We desire to emphasise the importance which we attach to this section. The work which has hitherto been carried on must in future be considerably extended. The Exhibitions Branch promises to be an increasing factor in the development of British trade. The &quot; Board of Trade Journal,&quot; which we consider of increasing utility, should be kept thoroughly up to date, especially with regard to all matters relating to the development of new trades and new brandies of trade within the United Kingdom.We think that the section should take into consideration the advisability of establishing branch offices for information purposes in the chief centres of industry where information of local importance should be specially registered, as well as at the Central Office. We are of opinion that the Central Office will afford the best assistance to trade generally if it continues to be located in the City of London.(4.) Transport, Light, and Power. This would include the consideration of all questions of general policy relating to transport, including shipping, canal, and railway rates, shipping conferences, and other transport combinations; the question of the conservation of fuel, and all questions of general policy regarding the generation and distribution of electricity, gas and water power, including the restriction of industrial and trade developments, owing to the existence of rights of way (e.g., unreasonable prevention of way-leaves for coal or for transmission lines for electricity, and the impeding of the construction of docks and harbours by public rights of way). To this section would also be assigned the growing questions connected with Aerial Transport.17.. Provision should also be made for the Commercial and Industrial Division of the Board being in constant and close communication with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and any other official bodies, such as the Imperial Institute and the National Physical Laboratory, and unofficial bodies, such as the Engineering Standards Committee, whose work has any bearing on the matters with which the division would be concernd.18. To the Commercial and Industrial Division of the Board of Trade there should be attached a strong unpaid Advisory Council, thoroughly representative of the commercial and  trading  interests of the country.    We suggest that the  trade
committees now in existence,^ with any alterations in personnel that may be^expedient to make them really representative, should be maintained as standing .^ Advisory Sub-Committees until after the period of reconstruction, and the question of their reconstitu-tion should then be considered.The Chairmen for the time being of these sub-committees should be ex officio members of the Advisory Council, which should also include representatives of the Association of Chambers of Commerce and other leading trade associations, such other Government Departments as the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Colonial Office, and also of the Dominion Governments. The representation on the Council should be based rather on industries than on geographical areas, and for this purpose, in addition to the representation given through the Association of Chambers of Commerce, some of the more important and comprehensive trade associations might be invited to nominate representatives. Provision should also be made for the repre-sentation of financial interests, and whatever rights on nomination be accorded to associations, we think the President should reserve to himself a certain number of appointments.19. The fact that a sub-committee exists for any particular branch of industry, and that its chairman is ex officio a member of the Advisory Council, should not exclude the appointment of other representatives of that industry. As a first list of trades which might be represented we suggest for consideration the Shipping Industry, the Coal Trade, the Heavy Iron and Steel Industries, the Sheffield and Birmingham Districts Metal Trades, the Electrical Trades, Shipbuilding, the Leather Trades, the China and Glassware Trader, the Paper Trade, and possibly the Food Export Trades. In the cases of the Textile Trades (cotton, wool, silk, linen, jute) and the Chemical Industries provision would necessarily have to be made for the representation of the various branches.We think that some provision should be made for the representation of the merchant class.20. The Advisory Council should meet at least monthly and have a General Purposes Committee, constituted by rota, meeting weekly. It should be arranged that one-third of the members of the Advisory Council retire each year &quot; the first retire-rnent being at the end of the second year), and are not eligible for re-election until at least one vear has elapsed. Any vacancy should be filled, so far as possible, by the appointment of a new representative of the same particular interest.21. The Trade Advisory Sub-Committees, as to which there should be some similar provision for systematic changes of membership, would be called together from time to time as occasion arises, and any officials in the Commerce and Industry Division who might be concerned with the business of the Committees would attend as a matter of course.22. Statistical Department-This department should consolidate the Census of Production and the Statistical sections of the present Commercial Department; it would have charge of the Census of Production, whether quinquennial or at more frequent intervals, and should also have charge of the collection, compilation, and publication of all statistics relating to railways, shipping, cotton, and other raw materials, and foreign commerce, and of the preparation of the various annual publications of the Board, so far as these do not relate to the regulative work of any department on the Public Services and Control side, it is, however, most desirable that the head of the Statistical Department should also exercise consultative functions with respect to these purely departmental statistical publications, but by far the greater part of his work will be related to that of the Commerce and Industry Division. We believe that more valuable results would be obtained from the formation of such a statistical department as we propose under the direction of highly-trained statisticians (and for this purpose the head of the department should have at least two highly-trained assistants well paid) than are likely to be obtained by the maintenance of a number of small statistical divisions under competent but not highly-skilled clerks.   The heads of* Viz., for 1. Financial Facilities. .,   2. Coal&quot;. ,,      Iron and Steel. ,,   4. Engineering. ,,   5. Electrical Trade. ,,   6. Texiile Trades. ,,   7. Non-Ferrous Metal Trade?. .,   8. Shipping and Shipbuilding.D. [1007]
this department would necessarily have to be in constant consultation with their colleagues, who would have to make use for their own special purposes of the statistics prepared by the Statistical Department, so that the salient facts may emerge and not only correctly tabulated dead figures.23. There remain three departments to which we have not yet referred, namely, the Legal, Finance, and Establishment Departments. The first of these was, we under-stand, prior to the war engaged chiefly with work connected with the regulative departments, and presumably its work would be mainly of that character in the future, though, as hitherto, the services of the Solicitor will be at the disposal of any part of the Board which may require them. The Finance and Establishment Departments will continue to serve the Board as a whole.24. An organisation such as that we have indicated is outlined in the appended diagram, and seems to us likely to provide that flexibility and power of expansion which we think essential, and to place the Board of Trade in a position which would enable it to command the general confidence of the commercial and trading community, and in which it would be competent to meet the growing demands of the country for Govern-ment information, assistance, and guidance. We think it of great importance that the first steps in the creation of such an organisation should be taken at the earliest possible moment, so that the Board may be equipped to play its proper part during the difficult period of commercial and industrial reconstruction after the war.25. We desire to draw special attention to the fact that the Ministry of Munitions has acquired a vast amount of information both as to the trade of the country, the possibility of regulating supplies so as to economise waste, the sources of supply of present and future raw materials, costs of production (so far as the same are not secret or individual), and the openings for future trade. All this mass of information and statistics, together with the information to be obtained from the War Trade Intelligence Department, the Censors Department of the War Office, and other War Departments, will be of great assistance to trade after the war, if intelligently handled. The Board of Trade should be ready and equipped to take over and deal with these matters, and should arrange in due time for the transfer to the Board of the services of such suitable members of the staff of the Ministry and the other departments above referred to as may be available.26. We attach much importance to the creation of a class of Foreign Trade Commissioners not resident abroad, but visiting foreign countries periodically to obtain a nearer survey of the trade of those countries, to stimulate the work of our consuls, and to report on possible openings for British trade and on hindrances and drawbacks from which it suffers.Whilst we recognise that the Consular Service must remain under the control of the Foreign Office we consider that closer and direct relations between the consuls and the Board of Trade should be established and encouraged.27. The manufacturers and traders of this country wish to have a Government Department to which they can refer in all questions of difficulty which they cannot by themselves solve. Many of these problems will have to be solved ultimately by statute, but until the Commerce and Industry Division of the Board of Trade is satisfied as to the advisability of adopting any particular line in the national interest, the President would no d-mbt hesitate to proceed to obtain statutory powers. On the other hand it should be the duty of the Commerce and Industry Division thoroughly to investigate all those questions on the demand of associations or traders, the chief object being to remove from their path everything which obstructs the free course of production, manufacture, and sale, and to see that British traders are not hampered either here or abroad in any unreasonable way, or in any matter in which by careful intervention on the part of the Board&apos; of Trade a satisfactory solution can be arrived at.28. In conclusion, we draw your attention to the fact that, for the successful carrying out of the work of the Commerce and Industry Division, in addition to inviting more frequently than hitherto the assistance of experienced members of the public, great reliance will have to be placed upon the efficiency of the senior officials. It will, we imagine, be frequently a case of obtaining men from outside, as distinct irom ordinary promotion within the ranks of the service. High qualifications and experience are essential if the Board of Trade is to command the confidence of manu-facturers and traders of the country, and to discharge adequately the duties which we have in view. We doubt very much whether it will be possible for the Board to obtain or retain the services of such officials as will be needed at the inadequate rates of pay now attributed to the senior officials.
Whilst we recognise the social status of the service and the pension advantages attaching thereto, ttiese considerations are not, in our judgment, sufficient for the purpose.   We venture to direct your earnest attention to this point.^Ve have &amp;cCLARENDON G. HYDE (Chairman).A. F. FIRTH.H. J. MACKINDER.C. T. NEEDHAM.Percy Ashley, Secretary. August 9, 1917.President.
