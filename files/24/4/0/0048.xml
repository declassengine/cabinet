6aftain Clwaent Jones [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1918.SECRET.G.-197.WAR   CABINET,PROPOSED FURTHER PURCHASE OF WHEAT IN AUSTRALIA.Interim Report No. 10 of a Committee appointed by the War Cabinet to considerthe question of an Economic Offensive.(Previous Papers Nos. G.-156, G.-158, G.159, G.-160, G.-161, G.-166, G.-167, G.-168, G.-170, G.-175, G.-177, G.-183, G.-187, G.-190, and G.-196, and War Cabinet 247 (8), 265 (18) and (19). 273 (16), 283 (17), 312 (6) and (7), 329 (4) and 351 (8).). 1. This Committee having carefully considered the statement of the Royal Corn-mission on Wheat Supplies (11th February, 1918) (Paper No. E.O.C.-64, Appendix), agree with the considerations put forward by the Royal Commission, and are of opinion that the recommendations as to the immediate purchase of wheat which are contained in this statement should be adopted with the least possible delay.2. In particular, from the point of view of the Economic Offensive, they are impressed with the point set forth in sub-section (/), viz., that the existence of a large block of wheat not definitely under the joint control of the Allies might be the cause of the gravest possible embarrassment, either during or immediately after any peace negotiations which may be entered into.3. The Committee being informed that the Colonial Secretary has been consider-ing this matter with a view to action, is of opinion that he should be charged with the execution of the policy above indicated.GEORGE N. BARNES.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, February 23, 1918.APPENDIX.E.O.C.-64. -ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE COMMITTEE.PROPOSED FURTHER PURCHASE OF WHEAT IN AUSTRALIA.Statement by the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies.THE Australian harvest operations commence in November and are completed in January and February, and the Australian Government have for some time past suggested that negotiations should be entered into for the purchase of the exportable surplus of the harvest just gathered. The position is that Great Britain, France, and Italy own about 2.500.000 tons of wheat still remaining in Australia of the previous harvests, and a further 1,000,000 tons of the harvest of Christmas 1916 is owned by the Commonwealth Government. The surplus of the harvest of Christ-mas 1917 is estimated to amount to about 2,000,000 tons. There is, therefore, at the present time between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000 tons of wheat in Australia available for export, about half of which belongs to Great Britain, France, and Italy, and the -remainder to the Commonwealth Government. The Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies ask for authority to negotiate for the purchase of this balance of wheat. From unofficial communications they have reason to believe that the French and Italian Governments would be prepared to participate in the purchase if it is authorised.[275] ,   i
The Royal Commission are aware that the Treasury do not favour the proposed purchase on general grounds,, and particularly because the previous purchases have been subjected, to adverse criticism by a Select Committee of the House of Commons. The Royal Commission appreciate the view that, when regarded purely from the standpoint of providing finance, this scheme may be open to objection, but in their opinion the advantages of such an operation should be held to outweigh any possible objection from this point of view.(a.) Wheat bought under&apos;the existing contract can only be shipped to Great Britain, France, and Italy. The Australian Government are anxious sellers to other destinations of the wheat they hold, and are consequently in active competition for ocean tonnage.(p.) The cereals available in the exporting markets situated nearer to Europe are definitely insufficient to meet the total needs of the Allies. It is, therefore, desirable to direct to Australia any new demands for cereals for the supply of neutral nations. The difficulty of effecting this would be lessened if it were possible to offer to provide &quot;wheat cargoes at a definite price. Under the present arrangements it would be necessary for each neutral country to enter into separate negotiations with the Australian Government.(c.) The present arrangements tend to lead to a waste both of foodstuffs and of tonnage. With two owners of the wheat in Australia it is not possible, with any completeness, to secure that the wheat, which will not keep, is first consumed. If all the wheat were in one hand the Royal Commission are advised that comparatively little waste would be incurred, unless it should remain impossible to export the wheat over a period of several years.Further, it could, and should, be made a condition of any further purchase that the Ministry of Shipping should have the sole direction of all shipping engaged in! wheat transport from Australia, and, further, that all ships at present under the control of the Australian Government suitable for wheat transport should be trans-ferred to the control of the Ministry of Shipping.(d.) The Commonwealth Government have guaranteed to purchase the present crop from their farmers at a price equivalent to 32s. f.o.b. This payment is now falling due, and past experience leads to the conclusion that the Commonwealth Government are likely to exert continually increasing pressure until some financial assistance has been received to enable them to meet this payment.(e) If the impression is given that the unexpected balance of wheat will be left as a loss on the hands of the Commonwealth Government, it is certain that the ten-dency to decrease the future production of wheat in Australia would be enhanced. Having regard to the improbability of obtaining wheat supplies in the future from Russia or Roumania, to the fact that the countries from which supplies are now available do not provide sufficient to meet the needs of the Allies, and to the doubt as to the future European supply, the Royal Commission would strongly deprecate any course which will decrease production in Australia.(/.&apos;) The strongest argument for immediate purchase of the remaining wheat in Australia is that the existence of such a large block of wheat not definitely under the joint control of the Allies might be the cause of the gravest possible embarrassment either during, or immediately after, any peace negotiations which may be entered into.Now that free purchases can be made in South America, it may be said that, with the exception of this block of wheat in Australia, the Allies and America jointly control, either actually or potentially, the entire cereal supplies of the world available for export, and the Royal Commission venture to suggest that the position would be enormously strengthened if the remaining wheat in Australia was also jointly controlled.The cost involved cannot be accurately determined until after negotiations, but it should not exceed  27,000,000 in all, of which, it may be assumed, one-half would fall to be borne by Great Britain. Some part of this cost would at onCe be saved by the advantage of control of the shipments and marketing of grain, and some part of the cost would be recouped by the control of shipping, and, quite apart from this, if peace should ensue while the grain remains fit for shipment, it is reasonable&apos; to suppose that the venture would immediately assume an attractive commercial aspect.
