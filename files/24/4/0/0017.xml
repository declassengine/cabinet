November 1917.SECRET.WAR CABINET.NON-FERROUS METALS BILL.Interim Report No. 2 of a Committee appointed by the War Cabinet to consider the Question of an Economic Offensive.(Previous Papers, Nos. G.T.-813, 967, 967a, 1182, 2128, and Nos. G. 156, 158, 159, 160, 161, 166, and War Cabinet 247, Minute 8.)1. THE Committee have been deeply impressed by the world-wide ramifications of the German organisation dealing with the non-ferrous metals and with the complete control which, at the outbreak of the present war, it had secured over the whole metal trade of the British Empire. That control will inevitably be re-established almost immediately after the war, unless in the meantime the place of the pre-war organisation is effectively taken by an organisation entirely free from all enemy influence or association.2. The Committee are informed by the Board of Trade that an organisation capable of effectively controlling the metal industry can be formed, and is assured of French and Belgian co-operation. The promoters, however, are not prepared to embark their capital in the enterprise unless they are insured in the initial stages against the danger of the re-establishment of the German organisation.3. That insurance would be afforded by the passage into law of the proposed Non-Ferrous Metals Bill, by which the right to deal in metals cannot be exercised for five years after the war by any enemy subject or corporation except by special licence of the Board of Trade.4. In order that the new organisation should get to work without delay, and that the metal trade of the Empire should be developed on satisfactory lines, the Committee urgently recommend that the Non-Ferrous Metals Bill (Appendix) should be introduced and passed into law at the earliest possible moment.5. In the event of the War Cabinet approving of the above recommendation, it will no doubt be desirable to communicate with the Dominions on the subject..  (Signed) E. CARSON, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., October 31, 1917[1115-2]B
APPENDIX.E.0.C.-2.---NON-FERROUS METAL INDUSTRY BILL.BEFORE the war the worlcTs metal market was largely controlled by a group of German metal companies engaged primarily in buying metals or in acting as selling agents for producers. These companies were closely connected by stock control, the inter-ownership of stock, interlocking directorates, or joint syndicates, and their relations were of such a nature as to lead to a common policy in respect alike of purchase and sale of metals. The most important of these concerns is the Metallgesellschaft, of Frankfurt-on-Main, with which are closely connected H. R. Merton and Co., in the United Kingdom, with its subsidiary the Merton Metallurgical Company and the American Metal Company in the United States. These, in their turn, combined with certain German metallurgical and financial interests to found, in 1910, the Metallbank and Metallurgische Gesellschaft, of Frankfurt-on-Main, with a capital of 2,000,000Z. This last-named organisation, either directly or through its constituent concerns, had by the outbreak of war established or acquired controlling or other financial interests in metal dealing, mining, or working companies or chemical companies in Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Holland, Spain, Australia, Africa, Mexico, and Italy. Distinct from the Metallgesellschaft group of companies, but closely associated with the same interests and with each other in various syndicates and combinations, were Beer, Sondheimer, and Co., of Frankfurt, with interests in companies in Germany, Austria,:Italy, Belgium, France, and the United States; and Aron Hirsch and Co., with subsidiary companies in Germany, the United States, and Australia. &apos;This control of the non-ferrous metal trade of the world by German or German-controlled interests has been a cause of grave embarrassment to the Allied Govern-ments during the war, and the question of the best means of preventing the re-establishment of that control has been occupying the attention of the Board of Trade for some time back. The matter has been discussed on more than one occasion with the French Government, and quite recently the Imperial War Conference passed a resolution declaring that it &quot; would welcome appropriate measures for the purposes of freeing the Empire and the Allied countries from their previous dependence on German-controlled organisations with respect to non-ferrous metals and ores.&quot;It is, however, the unanimous opinion of all the experts who have been consulted that in view of the widespread connections, highly developed organisation, and great , financial resources of the German group, it would be almost impossible for any new Imperial or Allied organisation to secure a firm footing in the metal markets of the Allied countries and of the world unless drastic steps are taken to prevent the revival within Allied territories of the operations either direct or indirect of the German interests. The French and Belgian Governments have expressed their willingness to take the necessary restrictive measures in their own countries, and the resolution of the Imperial War Conference quoted above shows that the dominions are in sympathy with the same policy. The Non-Ferrous Metal Industry Bill has been drafted to give effect to this policy within the United Kingdom.The Bill provides in clause 1 that no company, firm, or individual should engage in the business of extracting, smelting, dressing, refining, or dealing by way of wholesale trade in metal or metallic ore, to which the Bill applies, except under licence, which shall be renewable annually. The Bill applies to zinc, copper, tin, lead, nickel, and aluminium, and provision is made for its extension to other non-ferrous metals by order of the Board of Trade.Clause 1, sub-section (2) provides that the Board of Trade shall not grant a licence to a company or firm to which the conditions in the schedule apply, unless they are of opinion that for some special reason the grant of a licence is expedient. Any company or firm to which the conditions in the schedule do not apply will be entitled to the licence. The conditions are so framed, as to cover businesses controlled or managed to any substantial extent by persons who are or have been enemy subjects, and thus cover the case of a business controlled by naturalised British subjects of German origin. They also cover the case of close enemy association at the date of the introduction of the Bill through any shareholding in some neutral company.

Refining, and Dealing in certain Non-ferrous^Metals and Metallic Ores.BE it enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majesty, by and with.&quot; the advice and consent of the Lords&quot;Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows : 1.-(1.)
