[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.G-151.Note by the Secretary.&quot;I CIRCULATE herewith, for information a Note on the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence, with special reference to its work in connection with the preparation of Histories of the present War.I wish particularly to call attention to paragraph 11 of the Note.The Admiralty have been unable to release a considerable quantity of material for the Naval History, owing to the fact that a large part of it is of an exceptionally secret nature. Without access to the material that is withheld, it is impossible to complete a record of more than the first few months of the war, and, so far as the Naval History is concerned, a delay must occur in carrying out the promise made to Parliament, that publication would take place at or soon after the conclusion of peace;I have seen the First Sea Lord with regard to the matter, and am satisfied that the withholding of the material cannot be avoided.(Signed)        M. P. A. HANKEY, Secretary.June 11, 1917.HISTORICAL SECTION OF THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence was formed in 1907, as a result of the conclusions of that Committee, at a Meeting held on the 21st February, 1907, that they &quot; accept the principle that the work of preparing histories of naval and military operations should be concentrated and placed under the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot;2. The Section commenced its work in April, 1908, on the compilation of a History of the Russo-Japanese War. This was completed in July 1914, by which time Sir Julian Corbett, who had been engaged in writing a Confidential Naval History of that War on behalf of the Admiralty, had also brought his second and final volume to an end. It may be mentioned here that in consequence of the heavy demands made on the Stationery Office and the Ordnance Survey Department arising out of the present war, it has been found necessary to defer the publication of the final volumes of each of these works until the conclusion of peace.3. On the outbreak of the present War a commencement was at once made on the collecting and arranging of naval material, but it was not until three weeks later that the preparation of the History was entrusted to the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence.* On the 27th August, 1914, by direction of the Prime Minister, a Sub-Committee was formed under the Presidency of Vice-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade to &quot; consider and advise on the question of collecting material for a future History of the present War,&quot; and it is under the direction of this Sub-Committee that the work of the Historical Section is being carried out.4. On the 27th January, 1915, the Committee of Imperial Defence approved of the appointment of Sir Julian Corbett and Captain C. T. Atkinson at a fixed salary &quot;to supervise the collecting and collating of naval and military material respectively for the ultimate compilation of an Official History.&quot; Up to this time, from the beginning of the War, Sir Julian Corbett, who had offered his services gratuitously, had been employed on the naval material, but no attempt had been made to arrange the military material on any systematic plan. On the 1st March Captain Atkinson commenced work at Carlton House Terrace, but the space was soon found to be insufficient, and the Military Branch was transferred, through the courtesy of the Deputy-Keeper, to the Public Record Office. The Naval Branch has been housed at 2, Whitehall Gardens from the start.* The permanent Staf then consisted, as it does now, of a Secretary and Confidential Clerk. [699]
5. After the War had lasted for nearly a year the growing demand on the part of the public for fuller information as to.its progress could no longer be ignored. At the same time it was considered highly undesirable to give the information before the end of the War, and the best way to meet the situation appeared to be to commence at I once the preparation of a popular Official History, the publication of which could begin immediately after the conclusion of peace. No commencement, however, has been made of any Staff History beyond the preliminary stage of sorting, sifting, and filing the masses of material available.At the suggestion of the Committee, Sir Julian Corbett agreed, in addition to carrying on the direction of the Naval Branch, to write the Naval History, while the Hon. J. W. Fortescue undertook the Military History, on the understanding that the services of the Staff of the Historical Section should be available to provide the material. This arrangement was approved by the Admiralty and the War Office, and eventually sanctioned by&apos; the Treasury in February 1916.At the same time the scope of the two histories was defined as follows : Sir Julian Corbett to deal with Preparation for War.The General Policy of the War.The Naval Operations.All Oversea Operations.Foreign Policy in Relation to the War.. Mr, Fortescue to deal with Preparations for the Military Campaigns.The Military Operations in France and Flanders.The Military Operations of the Allies, so far as they affect our own operations. The major Oversea Expeditions, so far as Military Operations are concerned.. Recruiting. Military Organisation. . Army Munitions.6. An Account of the Economic Effect of the Attack and Defence of Trade is being prepared, in concert with the Historical Section, by Mr. C. E. Fayle, of the Garton Foundation. This it is proposed to publish in two volumes, the more confidential matter being omitted.The first volume will deal with the effect of the G erman cruiser operations upon our oversea trade as against our dispositions for its protection, and the disappearance of German shipping following upon the outbreak of war. Chronologically it will cover roughly the first six months of the War. The second volume will deal with the so-called submarine &quot;blockade &quot; of Great Britain and Ireland, and the corresponding-development of our blockade of Germany. The cost of this. History will not fall on public funds, nor will the State receive any royalties from its sale.7. The decisions arrived at were stated in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister on the 28th June, 1916.*8. By Agreement with the Stationery Office, who will hold on behalf of the Crown the copyright and all rights of translation, &amp;c, of the Naval and Military Histories, the former will be published by Messrs. Longmans and the latter by Messrs. Macmillan. Mr. Fayle has arranged with Mr. John Murray for the publication of the Trade History.9. It is unlikely that the question of the writing of the Professional Staff Histories will arise before the close of the War. The main consideration at the present time is to produce the Interim Histories as soon as possible after its conclusion.* &quot; Iu view of the demand which is likely to arise, and the desirability of providing the public with an authentic account, it has been decided to prepare for publication as soon as possible after the close of the War an Interim Official History dealing with its various aspects. This History will be based on the material which is being collected and arranged by the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence for an eventual Staff History.&quot; The work will be in three sections, which will deal respectively with the Naval and Military Operations and the General Effects of the War on Sea-borne Trade. i&quot;The Naval Section has been entrusted to Mr. Julian Corbett,-and the Military Section to Mr. John Portescue, while for the Trade Section the Trustees of the Garton Foundation have kindly placed their Staff at the disposal of the Historical Section.&quot; The sections will be published separately, but prepared in concert. The work is already well advanced.&quot;
10. The material upon which the Military History will be founded consists mainly of the War Diaries of the different units and the Intelligence Summaries. The chief work of the Military Branch of the Section is to make precis of these diaries and to arrange the precis so that they are available for writing the history of the operations. Up to May 1915 there has been no difficulty in dealing with the whole of this material. After that period the force in the field increased so greatly and the diaries sent in were so numerous that it is no longer possible to submit the whole of them to the above process.* In order not to fall behind the requirements of the Interim History, only the more important can be dealt with in this manner. Mr. Fortescue has now drafted one volume of his History clown to the end of the first battle of Ypres. But as this has been prepared mainly from the diaries it cannot be regarded as complete until it is revised in the light of the more Confidential Staff Correspondence, to which it is hoped access will soon be afforded.11. The material which forms the basis of the Interim Naval History is, on the other hand, of an entirely different nature, and consists of the telegrams passing between the Admiralty and Senior. Naval Officers at Home and Abroad. This is supplemented by Admiralty reports, papers, Ships&apos; Logs, Signal Logs, &amp;c.Without entering into details, it may be stated that this material is being sorted, arranged, and bound in volumes in such a form as to be of the greatest convenience for historical purposes, and so far as the material has been released by the Admiralty, means have been found for carrying on this work and producing the Interim History simultaneously.. Up to the 15th December, 1914, all material has been released, and for that period the arrangement of documents is well in hand and the drafting of the Interim History practically complete extending to about one volume.After that date, however, the Admiralty has found itself unable to release certain classes of documents, which as the War proceeds assume a more secret character. They are mainly telegrams passing between the Admiralty and the Senior Naval Officers, and, as explained above, these are precisely the documents on which the Interim History has been mainly based. Without access to them it is impossible to continue the production of the Interim History on the lines on which it has hitherto proceeded. Though a certain amount of progress may be made with.the less secret operations, no connected narrative can be written, and as the material withheld is not to be released till the end of the War, there will inevitably be a considerable interval between the production of the first and second volumes.With regard to the arrangement of papers a similar difficulty will arise, for, though there will be a certain amount of material to handle, it will be impossible to complete the volumes or prepare the papers in a form best suited for the compilation of the History.12. While the principal duties of the Historical Section are the arrangement of papers and the compilation of the Interim Histories, the Section is also writing up a comprehensive Diary of the War. This is being prepared in three parts Military, Naval, and Political and a full summary is given for each complete month. The Section also acts in an advisory capacity to the War Cabinet and its Secretariat, where information of an historical nature is required to elucidate current events.In addition to its purely historical functions the Section is continuously engaged in supplying information to other Departments and individual officers on questions in which they are concerned. Mr. Layard, who has given his services voluntarily from an early period of the War, is now, at the request of the Foreign Office, assisting Mr. Carless Davis in the compilation of a History of our Blockade Policy and is making use of material in the custody of the Section for this purpose.13. At the request of the Board of Trade and Admiralty the Historical Section has undertaken the supervision of an account of the part played by the Mercantile Marine in the War. The compilation of this record has been offered to Mr. Archibald Hurd, but the financial arrangements have not yet been settled.14. The personnel of the Sub-Committee referred to in paragraph 3 and the Staff of the Historical Section, with the estimated expenditure for the current year, are set forth in the Appendix to this Memorandum. .E. Y. DANIEL.June 8, 191 7.* In August 1914 from 250 to 300 War Diaries were received, ia May 1915 from 750 to 800, whereas there are now coming in between 4,000 and 5,000 per month.
