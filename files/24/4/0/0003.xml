SECRET.REPORT.1. THE Committee were of opinion that the reference covered the case of the Scandinavian countries and of Holland, and decided to investigate the position of the various countries separately.They have considered the naval and military opinions expressed by the War Staff and General Staff in the memoranda laid before them, and report as follows : In Regard to Norway.The Intervention of Norway.2. There seems to be so little danger of Norway joining the Central Powers against the Allies that this contingency need not be considered.3. Affairs in regard to Norway have nevertheless reached a somewhat precarious stage, because, though that country, in spite of the recent unfriendly actions of Germany, is not likely to declare war, she may be forced into hostilities if the United States were to take a strong line in regard to exports from Norway to Germany, or if Germany were to make demands which she was unable to meet. Sugh action may lead to an attack on Norway by Germany.4. If Germany were to declare war on Norway her offensive would probably be limited to attack by air, and the bombardment of coast towns. The contingency of a landing on the coast, however, must not be excluded. If it takes place it seems likely that the German transports would take advantage of the cover provided by the islands on the west coast of Sweden, and endeavour to effect a landing near the mouth of the Kristiania Fjord.5. In such an eventuality, since the power of action of Germany in the air is at present limited by the distance from Norway of her existing air bases in Schleswig to raids carried out by zeppelins, she might, in the first instance, attack and overrun Denmark, in order to establish air bases on the north of Jutland, from which she could undertake aeroplane raids against certain important points in the south of Norway, such as Kristiansand, the nitrate of ammonia works at the Norsk Hydro, which are specially valuable to France, and the zinc refinery at Sarpsborg.6. The German troops at present on the Schleswig-Holstein frontier are ample for the occupation of Jutland.7. Norway is totally unprepared for modern war, having but a small army, insuffi-cient artillery, few anti aircraft guns, an embryonic air service, and no resources for the production of munitions of war.Our Action in the Event of War between Norway and Germany.8. Military. From the military point of view the Committee are of opinion that, on account of Norway&apos;s weakness, it would be detrimental to the cause of the Allies if Norway joined in hostilities on their side.If this took place, we could not help Norwa)^ either with troops, of wmich we have none to spare, or, for the present, further than has already been arranged, with aeroplanes and anti-aircrait artillery, since there is a great demand for the latter from every theatre and from our present Allies, and our present supplies are limited. To send more aeroplanes and anti-aircraft guns to Norway than have been arranged for already would necessitate the curtailment of supplies for other ^quarters. Later on, as the production of aircraft increases, and the demands from elsewhere are satisfied or decrease, it may be possible to make larger provision for the needs of Norway.9. Naval. From the naval point of view, also, the Committee are of opinion that it would not be to the advantage of the cause of the Allies if Norway joined in hostilities on their side.
The Intervention of Sioeden.17. Though it seemed, two years ago, in spite of the treaty binding Sweden not to attack Norway, that Sweden miglit possibly declare war against Norway, that danger is much decreased. The King of Sweden and the governing and official classes are largely pro-German, but the population is mainly anti-German, and the probability, therefore, of Sweden departing from her neutrality to join either side is remote, especially now that all fear of liussia has vanished. It is suggested, however, that, in the event of excessive ^ economical pressure, Sweden could no longer maintain her neutrality.   She must join one side or the other, or starve.But, if this took place, we should at once occupy Kristiansand as an advanced base for the light craft of the Grand Fleet.10. This action would have the disadvantage of necessitating a vulnerable line of communication across the North Sea, of entailing the provision of light cruisers torpedo-boat destroyers, mine-layers, coal-ships, oil-ships, mines, nets, and all the accessories of a fleet, which would have to be taken from elsewhere, and of increasing our tonnage commitments for supply, but it would, on the whole, be worth doing, for the following reasons : (a.) Because it would deny this port to the German Fleet, and would provide us with a base for operating against the German submarines in the Skaggerak;(&amp;.) Because the presence of the British force at Kristiansand, and the temptation to the Germans to attack its lines of communication, might lead eventually to a general action between the British Grand Fleet and the German High Seas Fleet, such.as is desired.(c.) Because German submarines and i&apos;aiders attempting to pass through Norwegian territorial waters would be more easily open to attack.11. If the Germans attempted a landing, the vessels based on Kristiansand would be well placed to attack their transports and lines of communication, and their action might result in the High Seas Fleet being drawn out.12. The most likely place for such a landing to be attempted would be Frederikshald, near the Kristiania Fjord.13. The Admiralty have fully prepared plans for carrying out the operation of establishing a base for light cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and aircraft at Kristiansand, including the provision of a stock of mines and anti-submarine nets for the defence of that port, which is at present weakly defended.14. The Committee recommend : That the Admiralty plans should be put into execution, should the occasion arise.Possible Action by the United States.15. In regard to the naval assistance to be afforded by America, the Committee are informed that it is possible that the United States ma)7 send over a few battleships, some destroyers, and a few submarines, to be based on a designated Norwegian harbour, but that this course is unlikely and would be disadvantageous to the Allies, on the ground of the tonnage that would be necessary for supply, if, as has been stated, the United States Government intend to maintain a force of 1,000,000 men in France.As an alternative scheme, the Americans might occupy the same harbour as a base for small craft, since there is no base suitable for any considerable battle fleet south of Trondhjem.16. The Committee consider, however, that our present knowledge as to the possible action by the United States is not satisfactory.   They therefore recommend : That steps should at once be taken by the Admiralty, in conjunction with the Foreign Office, to obtain from the United States Government a definite statement of what they intend to do, to enable the Admiralty to form their own plans for acting in co-operation.In Hegaed to Sweden.
18. It is also unlikely that Germany will attack Sweden, which country has a far larger and better-equipped army than Norway. For Germany to do so now would be a very heavy commitment for her to assume.19. It is conceivable, though in the opinion of the Committee not probable, that Sweden might join Germany in an attack against Norway. In this case the situation of the latter country would be far more serious that if she were fighting Germany alone. She would in all probability be quickly overrun by the Swedish army, and would find it impossible to protect her vital factories.If Sweden, however, were to join Germany, the interruption of the transit trade to Russia, and the loss to us of the imports of ball-bearings, would be most serious, whilst the access of strength that the Germans might obtain from Sweden would amount ultimately to some 800,000 men.Our Action in the Event of War between Norway on the one side and Sweden andGermany on the other.20. Military.T-s-The Committee are of opinion that we could give no military assistance to Norway against Sweden.Naval. The Committee are of opinion that we could give no naval assistance to Norway against Sweden, since it would probably be impossible for us to maintain a base at Kristiansand against an attack from land by Swedish troops.Our Action in the Event of War between Sweden and Germany.21. Military.-The Committee are of opinion that we could give no military assistance to Sweden against Germany.22. Naval. The Committee are of opinion that Sweden is extremely vulnerable to attack by sea and by air, and that the Germans could do practically what they liked along the Swedish coast, and that, owing to the difficulty of passing through the Sound, we could give no naval assistance to Sweden.In regard to Denmark.The Intervention of Denmark.23. There seems to be so little danger of Denmark joining the Central Powers against the Allies that this contingency need not be considered.24. On the other hand, for various reasons, among which probably is her desire to remain on good terms with Denmark in order to ensure a portion of her food-supply after the war, Germany, apparently, does not wish to go to war with Denmark. But there is a danger that, in the event of her declaring war on Norway, she might not only overrun Jutland for the purpose of obtaining aerial bases from which to attack Norway, as described in paragraphs 6 and 7, but might also bombard Copenhagen.Our Action in the Event of War between Denmark and Germany.25. Military. The Committee are of opinion that we could give no military assistance to Denmark against Germany.26. Naval. The Committee are of opinion that we could give no naval assistance to Denmark against Germany, since there are no suitable harbours available on the coast of Jutland, and since any operation in the region of the Belts would necessitate the co-operation of strong military forces entailing a long and vulnerable line of sea communications.In regard to Holland.The Intervention of Holland. 27. There seems little chance of Holland voluntarily joining either the Allies or the Central Powers, while there is every probability of her resisting any invasion of her territory by either party.[891] C
As regards the significance of the intervention of Holland on either side, it is certain (i.) That if she were to join the Allies it would favour their strategic situation in the North Sea, and would also supply them with suitable bases for aerial operations against the Rhenish industrial area. The Allies, however, would in existing circumstances obtain no other marked military advantage, and there would be certain grave drawbacks and difficulties attendant on British co-operation with Holland, i.e. : (a.) The necessity of supplying munitions to a fresh Ally. (b.) The tonnage required to transport the above.(c.) The tonnage and drain on British resources required to keep the Dutch army and population furnished with supplies, since the latter would almost certainly have to be imported from overseas.(d.) The closing of our most valuable source of information.(ii.) That if she were to join the Central Powers it would be a great naval assistance to them and very detrimental to the Allies, owing to the potential value of her ports as bases for the German fleet.Hostile Action by Germany against Holland.28. There seems little chance of Germany deliberately invading Holland at present, because it would increase her liabilities, and unless the invasion were completely successful would result in giving the facilities of her ports to the Allies. It would also be a disadvantage to her to cut herself off from an important source of supply.29. Nevertheless, though neither Holland or Germany is desirous of going to war with the other, Germany may be forced to violate Dutch territory in anticipation of, or as a result of, the operations of the Allies on the coast of Belgium, tending to drive the Germans out of Zeebrugge. In that case the Germans would almost certainly endeavour to obtain control of the mouths of the Scheldt with the object of exploiting Antwerp as a port and the Scheldt estuary as a base for destroyers, submarines, and other craft.In order to do so it would be necessary for her to obtain command of both banks of the river. The southern bank could be reached in a very few hours by German troops now on the frontier between Knocke and Sas-van-Gent. The seizure of the northern bank would necessitate the occupation of Walcheren and South Beveland. It seems probable that the Dutch batteries at Flushing would oppose any landing on the southern shores of Walcheren, and consequently it might be necessary for troops to move from Antwerp down the railway through Bergen-op-Zoom to Middelburg or be ferried over from Ter Neuzen to Ellewoutsdyk.30. It is also possible, if the United States should cut off all supplies to neutrals, in order to tighten the blockade of the Central Powers, by which the value of Holland to Germany as a source of supplies would be greatly reduced, that the Germans might think it worth while to attempt to gain control of the mouth of the Scheldt without waiting for the development of our operations-on the Belgian coast. In this case they would probably endeavour to force Holland to join the Central Powers by threatening to stop all export of coal and iron, in which event, whether Holland agreed or not. they would attempt to seize the mouth of the Scheldt.31. Though it has been stated that Holland would probably make such an attempt a casus belli against- Germany, it is possible that she might do no more than protest; but in either case the result of her action would not be more than to delav the seizure by the Germans of the mouths of the Scheldt.32. Under whatever pretext it is effected, the possession of the mouth of the Scheldt would form a very valuable asset at the final peace negotiations.33. The consequences to this country and to the Allies of its possession by the Germans would be so disadvantageous that every effort should be made to prevent them seizing the island of Walcheren, though they could not use Flushing itself as a base if we were actually in possession of Zeebrugge and had heavy guns mounted there.
Our Action in the Event of War between Holland and Germany.34. To meet a threatened attack by Germany on the Scheldt, it would be necessary for us to forestall her by naval and military action, and by landing a force on the island of Walcheren, an operation which, to be successful, should be carried out within a very short time of the crossing of the Dutch frontier by the Germans.35. If the Dutch accmiesced in this action on our part, it would be possible for us to land a force at Walcheren without much difficulty. If they, in addition, took measures (which it is believed they have made preparations to do) themselves to resist invasion by the Germans, it would be possible for us to forestall the latter at Walcheren. But if the Dutch were to show themselves averse to such action on our part, and were to resist the landing of a force by us, not only could we not forestall the Germans, but the landing of troops and their maintenance, if landed, would be impracticable.36. It is essential, therefore, that before we undertake actual operations, the attitude of the Dutch in this matter should be ascertained. It is hardly necessary to point out the difficulty of taking any steps to ascertain the views of the Dutch Govern-ment, and that the greatest caution must be observed unless and until there is immediate prospect of the circumstances arising which would necessitate the carrying out of the operations foreshadowed.37. The Committee recommend, therefore (a.) That as full preparation as can be undertaken beforehand should be made at once, and secretly, to carry out the naval and military operations outlined in the joint scheme drawn up by the War Staff and General Staff, dated the Uh August, 1917.(b.) That a most careful watch should be kept on all developments in the situationbetween Holland and Germany. (c.) That so soon as there are definite signs that the Germans contemplate seizingthe Mouth of the Scheldt, steps should be taken to  sound the  DutchGovernment as to their attitude in regard to co-operation by us. (d.) That the action then to be taken by us should be settled in accordance with thenature of the reply received, and naval and military considerations.The Political Aspect of the Intervention in the War of the Northern .Neutral Powers generally.38. The Committee have examined, in all their aspects, the possible results of the intervention in the war of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Holland, and, in coming to their conclusions, have taken into due account the indirect advantage of the possible political effect on the Germans of such intervention. Their view, however, that the intervention of these countries even on the side of the Allies would on the whole not be an advantage to the Allies, is not shared by Lord Robert Cecil, who considers that: Apart from naval and military considerations, the entry into the war on our side of any of the Northern neutrals might be expected to have an important political and moral effect in Germany. The German people are undoubtedly feeling their increasing isolation from the rest of the world and they fear the economic effect of the loss of their markets after the war, and the destruction of the politico-commercial system that they have built up in various foreign countries. There is evidence that the declaration of war, or even the rupture of relations, by a comparatively unimportant South American Republic produced considerable moral effect in Germany. If, then, one of the Northern Neutral States were to take sides against the Germans it might well be the climax of their discouragement and might even drive them to sue for peace. This consideration seems to counter-balance any strictly naval and military disadvantages that would attach to the declaration of war on Germany, at any rate by Norway.Recapitulation of Recommendations.In regard to Norway.39. That the Admiralty plans should be put into execution, should the occasion arise.That steps should at once be taken by the Admiralty, in conjunction with ihe Foreign Office, to obtain from the United States Government a definite statement of what they intend to do, to enable the Admiralty to form their own plans for acting in co-operation.
In regard to Holland.(a.) That as full preparation as can be undertaken beforehand should be made at once and secretly, to carry out the naval and military operations outlined in the joint scheme drawn up by the War Staff and General Staff, dated the 8th August, 1917.(b.) That a most careful watch should be kept on all developments in the situation between Holland and Germany.(c.) That so soon as&apos;there are definite signs that the Germans contemplate seizing the Mouth of the Scheldt, steps should be taken to sound the Dutch Government in regard to co-operation by us.(d.) That the action then to be taken by us should be settled in accordance with the nature of the rsply received and naval and military considerations.(Signed)&apos;     EDWARD CARSON (Chairman). J. C.
