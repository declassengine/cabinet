I HA.VE read with great interest the Memorandum on Economic Offensive circulated by Sir Edward Carson. I welcome this memorandum, inasmuch as I agree cordially with Sir Edward Carson that the time has come when it is essential to take a forward step as regards our preparations for securing our economic position after the war.2. I am disposed to think that Sir Edward Carson, underrates the amount of preparatory work which has already been done in this direction. In particular,, the. Board of Trade has devoted a great deal of thought and energy to the matter; but in all departmental preparatory work a stage is usually reached, sooner or later, when further action depends on decisions o . high policy by the Government as a whole. I shall show below that this stage has been reached by the Board of Trade in several important cases mentioned by Sir Edward Carson in his memorandum, and I am glad to take the opportune now afforded of urging upon the Cabinet the importance of giving the necessary authorisation to enable the work which has already been done to be brought to fruition.3 To take, for example, the broad question of the control of natural resources during the reconstruction period so as to secure that the British Empire and our Allies have the first claim on such materials as they need for the restoration of their industries: (a.) It is evident that a fundamental condition of exercising any control for this purpose is that our present emergency powers for the control of imports and exports should not expire on the termination of the war, but should be extended during the reconstruction period. Sir Edward Carson alludes to this subject on p. 1 of his memorandum and mentions that on the 9th November. 1916, the Balfour of Burleigh Committee made recommendations on the subject. He seems to imply, however, that no action was taken to carry out those recommendations, but, as a matter of fact, the Board of Trade some time ago prepared a Bill for the purpose, copy of which is attached to this memorandum (Appendix I). It was discussed exhaustively with the Departments concerned and. was shown confidentially to Lord Balfour of Burleigh. It was also brought by the Board of Trade before the Imperial War Conference with a4 view to induce the Dominions&apos; representatives to initiate similar legislation in other parts of the Empire. 1 found, however, that apprehensions were felt, especially among the Dominions&apos; representatives, that the introduction of such a Bill at the present stage of the war would be interpreted as a declaration of intention to discriminate between our Allies and neutral countries, and, in consequence, the matter has not proceeded further.(b.) Another matter alluded to by Sir Edward Carson is the suggestion contained in Sir Ernest Pollock&apos;s memorandum as to the desirability of pressing on without delay the establishment of a British metal organisation. In this I am entirely in agreement, but Sir Edward Carson is perhaps not aware of the lengthy and elaborate negotiations which have been going on for several months upon this subject.[1033] B
f2I have had more than one personal discussion with the French Minister of Commerce, who is anxious that an inter-Allied organisation should be set up capable of countering the influence ol the German Metallgesellschaft and its associated companies. Negotiations have also taken place with representatives of the Dominions and with financial and industrial groups in this country. The result is that a complete scheme for an Imperial metal company is in an advanced state of preparation, and I believe that the necessary financial and industrial support can be secured.But there is one essential condition which is necessary before British capitalists will put their money into such an undertaking, viz., that German influence shall be eliminated for an adequate period after the war from the whole business of dealing in non-ferrous metals in this country. The necessary measure for securing this end has not been easy to draft, but it was prepared and submitted to several of my colleagues several months ago. Here again, for reasons mainly, I believe, connected with pressure on Parliamentary time, the Bill has not been introduced. I attach a copy of this Bill to the present memorandum (Appendix II),(c.) One of the most important of the Paris resolutions appended to Sir Edward Carson&apos;s memorandum is that numbered C.-1, which binds the Allies to take the necessary steps to render themselves independent of enemy countries so far as regards essential commodities.Whatever be the fate of the Paris resolutions as a whole, it has long been regarded as beyond the range of controversy that we are bound to take care that our dangerous dependence on Germany for certain vital commodities shall never recur.Much the most important of these &quot;key&quot; industries is the manufacture of artificial dye-stuffs, and since the first few weeks- of the war successive British Governments have consistently treated the development of dye manufacture in the United Kingdom as a special case requiring and justifying State action of a kind which would not necessarily be justifiable in the case of industries generally.It is, indeed, perfectly clear from a study of German literature that the Germans expect at the end of the war to be able to hold us to ransom and to extort favourable economic terms of peace by the power of refusal of two necessary articles, viz., potash and dyes.With regard to potash, I believe that considerable progress is being made towards rendering us independent of Germany.As regards dye-stuffs, the question is far more difficult and complicated because of the vast range of dyes and the immense advance that Germany has secured over this country in the necessaiy technical and scientific equipment. Nevertheless, great progress has been made, and of late I have constituted a special department of the Board of Trade (under Sir Evan Jones) for the express purpose of fostering and encouraging the development of dye manufacture. Our efforts, however, have tended recently to be paralysed by the growing difficulty of obtaining materials and plant for extensions and developments, and I have felt considerable anxiety lest we shall find ourselves at the end of the war still unable to supply the needs of our great textile industries. This of course would be a most unfortunate position in which to enter peace negotiations, since the export industries dependent upon dyes amount to not far off J(X),000,000Z. per annum, and Germany, knowing the position that we are in as regards these industries, would be able to drive almost any bargain that she desired as regards our economic treatment of her trade. If then we desire to avoid being held to ransom in this v?a,y, it is essential that the Government should recognise that the dyes industry is on a footing, not of a post-war trade, but of a war industry, since the extent of its development during the war may profoundly affect our negotiating power at the end.I am glad to be able to say that the Minister of Munitions has recently, at my urgent representations, agreed to place dye manufacture on the footing of a war industry as regards demands for materials. I should, however, greatly value a ruling of the War Cabinet that, for the reasons stated above, the dye industry is to be regarded as a war industry for all purposes, including, if required, the issue of capital.I should also be glad if the War Cabinet would confirm the conclusion arrived at by a strong Cabinet Committee of the last Government,^ that it would be essential during the reconstruction period after the war to regulate the importation of dye-stuffs by means of a licensing system to be exercised by some appropriate authority in consultation with the manufacturers and users of dyes. The Board of Trade have been acting on the assumption that this unanimous conclusion represents the considered* This Committee included in its membership Mr. Bonar Law, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Dr. Addison, Mr. McKemm, and Mr. Runciman.
policy of the Government, as it is known to represent the considered views of the users and manufacturers. I should be glad, however, to take this opportunity of obtaining an authoritative ruling on the subject from the War Cabinet.4. I have given the above examples of only a few (out of mauy*) steps taken by the Board of Trade with a view to safeguarding our economic position after the war, partly to show how much is in progress, and partly to obtain the necessary authority to carry on and complete the work.5. Sir Edward Carsons memorandum also raises the general question of policy as to the carrying out of the Paris resolutions, especially the resolution dealing with the conservation of natural resources during the reconstruction -period. The Board of Trade have expressed their views very clearly on this subject in a memorandum dated the 20th July, which was circulated to the War Cabinet, and a copy of which is appended for reference (Appendix III). This memorandum was, as Sir Edward Carson states, withdrawn temporarily from the consideration of the Cabinet, in view of the fact that M. Clementel at his last visit brought forward on behalf of the French Government a series of proposals for a combined economic offensive, which to some extent covered the same ground, and which appeared to require careful examination before a decision could be taken on. the Board of Trade memorandum.M. Ciementefs scheme was discussed at the War Cabinet on the 20th August, with the result that I was directed, &quot; after consultation with other Departments concerned, such as the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Blockade, and the Ministry of Munitions, to examine M. Clementel&apos;s scheme and report to the War Cabinet. This examination is now in progress, and I hope to present a preliminary report very shortly from which the War Cabinet will be in a position to decide as to the nature and scope of any further discussions to be conducted with either the French, the Americans, or both.6. Sir Edward Carson refers to the question of Imperial preference, but as this was the subject of a decision by the Imperial War Cabinet, and the details have been referred to a Committee of Ministers presided over by Mr. Long, I think it unnecessary to deal in detail with the matter in this memorandum.I may, however, remark that it would be a great convenience if the future policy of the Government as regards Imperial preference in respect, at least, of important articles already dutiable, e g., sugar, were settled as soon as possible, as it is impossible to take adequate steps to safeguard our future supplies of sugar without some indication of policy in this matter.7. I note that Sir Edward Carson attaches importance to the denunciation of our existing commercial treaties with foreign countries, and even suggests that this matter is one which we should discuss with France and the United States. It appears to me, however, that the general question of denouncing commercial treaties is one solely for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide without reference to any action of our Allies, inasmuch as the effects on our trade of such denunciations are determined by a large number of special and local considerations which could not well be discussed with some of our chief trade competitors. On the question of policy there has been no doubt or delay so far as the Board of Trade are concerned. Their opinion, which has never varied, has been clearly expressed in the Board of Trade letter to the Foreign Office of the 2nd June, 1917, to which Sir Edward Carson alludes in his memorandum. I consider that any such denunciation as has been proposed is premature and undesirable unless and until the Government has decided on a course of economic policy inconsistent- with the treaties which it is proposed to denounce. No such decision has to my knowledge been taken, and I have never been able to understand on what ground the Paris resolutions are held by some to be incompatible with the maintenance of our treaty engagements. The only resolution which might affect treaty engagements is that relating to the conservation of natural resources, which only affects the reconstruction period, and as to which the recent opinion of the Lord Chancellor (annexed to this memorandum, Appendix IV) is very pertinent. Moreover, our representatives at Paris expressly reserved the treaty position in giving their assent to this resolution. &quot;1 am convinced, on the other hand, that the denouncing of our commercial treaties would in certain cases expose our trade to considerable peril after the war.   Several of* V &apos; &apos;&apos; tl,e formation of llie Blitish Trade Corporation, which is urged in Sir E. PolloeFs memorandum (quoted by Sir E. Carson), is already completed. Conferences of the Governments of different parts of the Empire on the subject of the future position as to wool and meat have been arranged and will shortly take place. Communications are passing with the Egyptian Government as to the control of the cotton crop, &amp;c.
the treaties to which we are parties, though not giving our trade all the protection we could desire, are nevertheless valuable safeguards as far as they go, and some of them could probably not be negotiated at the present time on such favourable terms.- 8. There is only one other point to which I would refer. Sir Edward Carson concludes his memorandum by proposing that the preparation for the organisation of our economic resources should be undertaken at once by the Board of Trade. In this proposal I concur; but I do not think that this matter falls within the scope of the Department of Commercial Intelligence, which is now being enlarged and reconstituted under the recent agreement between the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office. That Department is solely concerned with the collection and diffusion of commercial information for the benefit of our traders. The preparation of schemes involving commercial policy is one on which the Board of Trade on the commercial side, and the Foreign and Colonial Office on the political side are, and I think must continue to be, the chief advisers of His Majesty&apos;s Government,Immediate Recommendations.The recommendations which I suggest should have the immediate consideration of the War Cabinet are : (a.) That the Imports and Exports Restriction Bill should be introduced at theearliest possible date. (&amp;.) That the Non-ferrous Metal Industry Bill should be introduced at the earliestpossible date.(c.) That the dye industry is to be regarded as a war industry for all purposes. (d.) That the previous decision as to the necessity of regulating the import ofdye-stuffs after the war should be confirmed. (e.)5That steps be taken to clear up the position of the United States with regardto the conservation of the economic resources of the Allies during thereconstruction period.(Signed) A. H.

Memorandum.The present powers of His Majesty as to prohibiting the importation and exportation of goods are as follows : -(i.) Under the Customs Consolidation Act he has power by Proclamation or Order in Council to prohibit the importation of any goods, but not to prohibit the importation of goods of any specified origin.(2.) Under section 8 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, he has power to prohibit absolutely the exportation of certain specified goods (arms, &amp;c), and this power has been extended by the Customs (Exportation Prohibition) Act, 1914, to all goods of any description, but the extension has effect only while a state of war exists.(3.) Under the Exportation of Arms Act, 1900, he has power to prohibit the exportation of certain specified goods to any country or place named in the order, and this power has been extended (a.) To the exportation of all goods of any description by the Customs(Exportation Restriction) Act, 1914 ; and (?).) To the exportation of goods to any such country or place unlessconsigned to particular individuals by the Customs (ExportationRestriction.) Act, 1915.The extension has effect only whilst a state of Avar exists.The result is that immediately the war terminates there will be no power (1) to prohibit importation of goods of a particular origin; or (2) to prohibit exportation except in the case of certain specified classes of goods; and most of the proclamations and orders relating to exports which have been made during the war, under the above-mentioned Acts, will cease to have effect.The practical effect of the present Bill is to continue for a period of five years [cju. twelve months] after the termination of the war, the powers which His Majesty has possessed and exercised during the war, adding, as regards importation, the power to prohibit the importation of goods of a particular origin. It is proposed to effect this by an entirely fresh enactment with a saving for orders, &amp;c, made under the existing enactments, rather than by continuing the operation of those enactments.Draft of a Bill to continue, with modifications, for a -period of five years [qu. twelve AD. 1917. months&apos;] after the termination of the present War, certain powers in relation to Imports and Exports.BE it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows : 1.-(1.) His Majesty may by Proclamation or Order in Council prohibit the Restriction importation or exportation of goods of any class, description, or origin specified in the ^nd^xports Proclamation or Order, either generally or from or to any country or place named in the Proclamation or Order, or subject to such exceptions as may be specified in the Proclamation or Order.[1033] C
(2.) Any Proclamation or Order made under this section may be varied or added to by order made by the Lords of the Council on the recommendation of the Board of Trade.(3.) Any Proclamation, or Order in or of Council, made during the present war, and in force at the date of the terminatian thereof, prohibiting or restricting ^ the importation or exportation of goods, shall, as from the said termination, continue in force and have effect as though it had been made under this section.(4.) This section shall have effect as though it were included in &quot; The Customs 39 &amp; 40Viet. Consolidation Act, 1876&quot; ; and the provisions of that Act, and of any Act amending or c* 36- extending that Act, shall apply accordingly ; and if any person ships or attempts toship goods in contravention of any Proclamation or Order made under this Act with respect to exportation he shall be liable to the same penalty to which a person is liable under section 186 of that Act, for illegally importing goods the importation of which is prohibited.(5.) This section shall continue in operation until the expiration of a period of five years [qu. twelve months] after the termination of the present war.(6-) The powers conferred by this section shall be in addition to and not in derogatiou of any other powers of His Majesty whether conferred by statute or otherwise.Short title.        2.

(1.) It shall not be lawful for any company, firm, or individual after the expiration of three months from the passing of this Act, or such longer period as the Board of Trade may in any particular case allow, to engage in the business of extracting, smelting, dressing, refining, or dealing by way of wholesale trade in metal or metallic ore [or product] to which this Act applies, unless licensed to do so by the Board of Trade :Provided that the purchase of metal by persons for the purposes of their trade shall not be deemed to be dealing in such metal by way of wholesale trade where the trade carried on by the purchaser is not primarily the trade of dealing in metals.(2.) In the case of a company, firm, or individual with respect to which any of the conditions set forth in the Schedule to this Act apply, no licence shall be granted unless the Board of Trade are of opinion that for any special reason the grant of a licence is expedient, but save as aforesaid any company, firm, or individual engaged or proposing to engage in such business as aforesaid shall on making application in the prescribed manner, and on furnishing such information and allowing inspection of such books and documents as may be reasonably required, and on payment of the prescribed fee, be entitled to a licence under this Act.(3.) A licence under this Act, unless suspended or revoked, shall remain in force until the day of following the date of issue of thelicence, but shall be renewable annually, and the same provisions shall apply to the renewal of the licence as apply to the grant of a licence.(4.)

APPENDIX III.Proposed Conference with U.S.A. and France on the Conservation of the Material Resources of the Allies during the Reconstruction Period.THE entry of the United States of America into the war must seriously affect the position in regard to the supplies of foodstuffs and raw materials after the war, and appears to necessitate further consideration of the necessity and practicability of the adoption by the Allies, including the United States, of a common policy to conserve their natural resources for their own use during the reconstruction period.There are a number of foodstuffs and raw materials of great importance, in respect of which it is to be anticipated that there will be a world shortage and very keen competition for supplies immediately after the war, owing to the falling off in agricultural production, the almost complete depletion of stocks of materials in enemy countries, and the transport difficulties in the way of securing the necessary stocks in Allied and neutral countries, the need for making good the destruction Avrought in the occupied areas of Allied countries and in the Allied mercantile marine, the increasing demands in countries like the United States and Japan by industries developed during the war, and the demand of industries anxious to recover as rapidly as possible the ground lost both in home and foreign markets owing to the circumstances of the war.. It will be recalled that this problem formed the subject of one of the resolutions of the Economic Conference of the Allies in June .1916. Resolution B. Ill was as follows: -(: The Allies declare themselves agreed to conserve for the Allied countries before all others their natural resources during the whole period of commercial, industrial, agricultural, and maritime reconstruction, and for this purpose they undertake to establish special arrangements to facilitate the interchange of these resources,&quot;to the extent of one-fifth or more of the capital in any undertaking whether or not in the United Kingdom, engaged in business of a kind to which this Act applies, in which enemies are also interested directly or indirectly to the extent of one-fifth or more of the capital.5. That the company, firm, or individual is or was at any time after the day of nineteen hundred and seventeen directly or indirectly controlledby a company, firm, or individual, to whom a licence under this Act would be refused.6. That the companjr, firm, or individual, is by any means whatever subject to enemy influence or association.For the purpose of this Schedule The expression &quot;enemy&quot; means a subject of an.enemy State and an enemycontrolled corporation. The expression &quot; enemy State &quot; means any State with which His Majesty is at thepassing of this Act, or has after the passing of this Act, become at war.The expression &quot;enemy controlled corporation &quot; means any corporation (a.) where the majority of the directors or the persons occupying theposition of directors by whatever name called, are subjects of such aState as aforesaid ; or (&amp;.) where the majority of the voting power is in the hands of persons whoare subjects of such a State as aforesaid, or who exercise their votingpowers directly or indirectly on behalf of persons who are subjectsof such a State as aforesaid ; or (c.) where the control is by any means whatever in the hands of personswho are subjects of such a State as aforesaid ; or (d.) where the executive is an enemy controlled company or where themajority of the executive are appointed by an enemy controlledcompany.The expression &quot;capital&quot; in relation to a company means any shares or other securities issued by the company which carry any voting power with respect to the management of the company.
No positive proposals as to the manner in which the policy thus indicated should be carried out were put forward at the Conference, and the British delegates expressly stated their view that no uniform method could be adopted, as each commodity would need to be considered separately, uniformity of treatment being impossible, and that it would be necessary to have regard to the commercial treaty position in framing any policy to give effect to the resolution. No decision as to any common action has yet been taken, but the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy, in their interim report dated the 14th December, 1916, have recommended that action should be taken with a view to the conservation for the United Kingdom and the Allies* of certain commodities of special importance, of which there is likely to be a world shortage. The commodities to which die Committee directed attention especially were raw cotton (Indian and Egyptian), raw wool, raw jute, flax, hemp, oil-seeds and nuts, metals (especially non-ferrous metals), hides, and tanning materials.The Committee expressed the opinion that any measures adopted for this purpose  t&quot; Should aim at securing to the British Empire and the Allied countries priority for their requirements, and should be applied only to materials which are mainly derived from those countries and will be required by them.&quot; This policy should be applied, as regards the United Kingdom, by legislation empowering the Government to prohibit the export, under licence, of such articles as may be deemed expedient. Under these powers the export of certain commodities which we, specify should be controlled, as well as that of any other important commodities in the case of which there may be found to be a dangerous shortage. The regime should be administered with the help of strong committees, on which the trades concerned should be fully represented.&quot;As regards the British Empire and the Allied countries, the Government should without delay enter into negotiation with the various Governments concerned, with the view to the adoption of suitable joint measures as regards selected commodities of importance.&quot;The entry of the United States into the war modifies the position in two directions. If the co-operation of that country in the general policy of conserving Allied production for Allied needs during the transitional period after the war can be secured, the range of commodities to which the policy might be applied would be materially increased, and one of the greatest difficulties in the way of its application would be removed ; but, on the other hand, the anxiety felt in respect of some raw materials (e.g., wool and Egyptian cotton) is largely due to the rapidity with which the United States demand has increased during the war.In these circumstances it appears desirable that an immediate effort should be made to discuss with the United States the general principles to be applied to this particular subject and, if possible, to arrive at a clear undertanding as to the extent to which any one of the Allies shall be entitled to priority in respect of any particular supply and the machinery for giving effect to such priority.Essentially the discussion must be one between the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, seeing that they are the three countries engaged in the war against the Central Powers which mainly control supplies ol important raw materials, and that the precise methods to be employed to control the distribution of those supplies must consequently in any case be settled by those countries. It is, therefore, desirable that, in the first instance at any rate, the proposed discussion should take the form of an exchange of views between these three countries, rather than a conference of all the Allies. The discussion should take place either in Paris or in London. If this course is agreed to in principle it will be necessary to draw up a list of the more important articles to which it may be suggested thai the arrangements among the Allies^ should apply, and to consider how best to arrive at some standard on the^basis of which the amounts to be allocated to the various Allied countries should be fixed.Board of Trade, July 20, 1917.The report was presented before the entry of the United States into the war.
APPENDIX IV.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.THE Lord Chancellor presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and in answer to the observations sent to him under date, 10th instant, has the honour to submit the following : In considering whether the recommendations of Lord Balfours Committee can be carried out consistently with commercial treaties as to prohibition of export, &amp;c, no attention need be paid to treaties with the countries at present at war with His Majesty&apos;s Government, as these treaties would be determined by the war, and the terms of peace will be such as to make it plain that they are not to be treated as renewed.As regards other countries, the recommendation is that exports should take place only under licence, and that discrimination should be exercised between different countries by permitting exports to some and not to others. This could certainly amount to an infringement of treaties containing most-favoured-nation clauses, such as those to which I have referred.The object in view might, however, so far as the prevention of exports to the present enemy countries is concerned, be achieved to a considerable extent without any infraction of such treaty obligations. If the licence for export were granted only in the case of consignments to countries from which re-export of the goods imported to them under licence from this country is prevented, the danger of their finding their way to the enemy countries &quot;would be obviated. If there were any reason to believe that re-export &quot;was being permitted, licences in respect of consignments to persons in such neutral countries might be refused, and this would probably prove an effectual sanction. There would be equal treatment all round, as the licences would be granted in respect of all countries on the same terms. I assume that the Allied countries would be ready to acquiesce in a proposal of this nature.It might, however, be desirable for a short time after the termination of the war, in the case of certain articles, to forbid their exportation altogether, except to such countries as (say) France and Belgium, on the ground that all that we could export would be absolutely necessary to enable these countries to repair the ravages of war. If British merchants can be induced to abstain from making sales of the articles in question to persons in any countries other than those where such supplies are imperatively necessary to repair the damage of war, no difficulty with regard to the most-favoured-nation clause would arise. Our whole available exports of such articles would go to (say) France and Belgium by the action of the sellers. But if it were found necessary, owing to the impossibility of securing such action on the part of British merchants, to forbid exports to countries other than such Allied countries as imperatively need supplies of these articles, there would be the strongest possible moral justification for taking this course, as &quot; no claim can be conceived stronger than that which our Allies in war would have upon us for the provision of the means to enable them to make good the damage which hostile operations have occasioned to their bridges, roads, railways, machinery, &amp;c.&quot; I do not think that this moral obligation would amount in point of strict law to an answer to a claim founded on a treaty containing a most-favoured-nation clause. But a treaty cannot be dealt with as if it were merely a bargain between two merchants enforceable by municipal law. Our moral obligations to (say) France and Belgium may well, looking at the matter broadly, be held to outweigh our obligations as measured by the strict terms of these treaties. The higher obligation may prevail over the lower, especially as such a state of circumstances cannot be supposed to have been in contemplation of the parties to the treaty at the time it was made.From the practical point of view, the entry of the United States into the war as our Allies may profoundly modify the situation from many points of view.It appears to me that it would not be politic to determine the treaties at present. Such a wholesale denunciation of treaties with the most-favoured-nation clause might conceivably have a bad effect in the United States as well as in the other countries affected.I have no further observations of a general nature to make beyond those already submitted.(Signed) FINLAY.House of Lords, March 23, 1917.o
