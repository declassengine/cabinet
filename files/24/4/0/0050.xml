CONFIDENTIAL.GENERAL  SMUTS&apos;   MISSION  TO  EGYPT.(A.)-ITINERARY.On the 5th February I left London for the Middle East, taking with me Brigadier-General Stewart, of Field-Marshal Haig&apos;s Headquarters; Colonel Kirke, of the Imperial General Staff; Lieutenant-Colonel Amery, of the Staff of the Supreme War Council; and Captain Lane, War Cabinet Staff. The First Lord of the Admiralty and Sir Guy Granet, Director-General of Military Transport, had preceded me, and were to meet me in Rome in order to discuss certain transportation questions.The 6th February I spent at Versailles discussing various questions in connec-tion with my mission with Sir Henry Wilson, and collecting information in possession of the Staff at Versailles, and bearing on the campaigns in Palestine and Mesopotamia.On the 8th February I reached Rome, and there had various discussions with Sir Eric Geddes, Sir Guy Granet and General Nash. I also saw General Grey, who had been in charge of the Inland Water Transport in Mesopotamia, and explained to me fully the transportation situation on the Tigris. As a result of these dis-cussions, I thought it unnecessary for Sir Guy Granet to proceed with me to Egypt as had been originally intended.On the 9th February I reached Taranto, and inspected the camp through which our troops to and from Salonica and Egypt have to pass. There was already accommo-dation for 4,000 troops, and extensions were in progress which would increase the capacity of the camp so as to accommodate 10,000 troops. The camp on the whole is well situated and suitable for the purpose for which it was intended.On the 11th February I reached Alexandria and met Admiral Jackson, and dis-cussed with him the possibility of landing stores on the Palestine and Syrian coasts in connection with General Allenby&apos;s advance&apos;. He told -me that as much as 1,000 tons a day had already been landed in fine weather, and he expected, once Haifa was opened for traffic, that he could probably deal with a larger daily tonnage in fine weather. The netting for Haifa Harbour was arriving, and as soon as the place had been taken by land operations its preparation and development by the Navy would be urgently pushed forward. Stormy weather had continually interfered with the landing of stores, but with better summer weather coming and the opening of Haifa he expected much more use could be made of the coast for transportation purposes.While I was passing through Alexandria I ascertained that General Hopwood, who had been General Maude&apos;s Chief of General St&amp;ff, was there on his way to London. I took him with me part of the way to Cairo in order to discuss with him the general situation in Mesopotamia with which he was fully conversant. The dis-cussion with him proved very valuable, and materially strengthened my impression that the Mesopotamian campaign would have to be reduced to a strictly defensive basis in future.On the night of the 11th February I reached Cairo, and spent two days there, leaving on the evening of the 13th for General Allenby&apos;s Headquarters in Palestine. At Cairo I stayed with Sir Reginald Wingate, with whom I had the advantage of discussing many important questions. I also met in Cairo Major-General Bols, General Allenby&apos;s Chief of General Staff, and Brigadier-General Macauley, in charge of the Egyptian and Palestine railways, and discussed with them the situa-tion in Palestine, both in its strategical and transportation aspects. Colonel Storrs, the Governor of Jerusalem, who happened to be in Cairo, gave me valuable informa-tion as to the political relations of Arabs and Jews. This question was also incidentally-discussed with Sir Reginald Wingate and Generals Allenby and Clayton. I make a brief reference to it later. .[288] b
At Cairo I also met Major-General Salmond, who is in charge of aviation in the Middle East. I discussed the air situation with him. and inspected the aero-drome and training school at Heliopolis. On my return to Egypt from Palestine I inspected the aerodrome, repair, construction, and store sheds at Alexandria, and formed a very favourable opinion of the training and air work generally of this area. I refer to this again later.The 14th, 15th, and 16th February were - spent in discussions with General Allenby and his principal officers at his Headquarters, and in visits to various important parts of his front which enabled me to form a general conception of the physical and other conditions with which his advance is faced. The strategic, transportation, and other questions connected with his future advance were fully discussed, and as a result of these discussions I sent to the War Cabinet the tele-gram of the 15th February, No. X 3 (Annex I), setting forth my recommendations for the future plan of campaign for their approval. I also sent supplementary telegrams to the War Office dealing with future railway, transport, and other requirements. I was greatly struck wherever I went by the fine healthy appearance of the troops in spite of the considerable hardships recently undergone by them, by their high spirits, and by the universal confidence which the Commander-in-Chief, General Allenby, has succeeded in inspiring in all ranks.On the night of the 16th February I returned with General Allenby to Egypt in order to meet General Gillman, General Marshall&apos;s Chief of General Staff, who arrived at Cairo on the 20th February. The situation in Mesopotamia was fully discussed with him, and the views he expressed only confirmed the provisional con-elusions at which I had arrived from my previous study of the problem. He and General Marshall had, as a matter of fact, independently arrived at the same con-elusion as myself, after a careful study of the railway problems involved in a simultaneous advance either by the Tigris or the Euphrates route, and General Marshall had agreed that he could reduce his force to four divisions for purely defensive operations. I also had an opportunity to continue the discussion of trans-portation questions with Admiral Jackson and Generals Macauley and Campbell, the Quartermaster-General to General Allenby, as well as further opportunities of discussing the general situation with. General Allenby and with the High Cbmmissioner.I left Egypt on the 22nd February, and arrived on the 25th at Taranto, where I was able to go further into the question of supplementing the railway in Palestine by landing stores on the coast, or at Haifa and Beirut, with Commodore Unwin, Principal Naval Transport Officer, Eastern Mediterranean, who confirmed the favourable expectations of the possibilities of development in this direction which I had already formed as a result of my discussions with Admiral Jackson. I also discussed with Commodore Unwin his labour and other requirements in connection with the proposed development in the landing of stores. After spending the 26th February in Rome and the 28th in Paris, I returned to London on the 1st March.Throughout I met with the greatest courtes)?- from all the officers referred to above, and the greatest readiness to supply all available information, and I especially acknowledge my great indebtedness to Sir Reginald Wingate and Sir Edmund Allenby for the assistance they have given me in my enquiries.(B.)-CO-ORDINATION OF THE CAMPAIGNS AGAINST TURKEY.The Military Representatives of the Supreme War Council, in their note on the campaign for 1918 (Joint Note No. 12), have laid down that the offensive against Turkey should be envisaged, not as a series of disconnected operations, but as a single co-ordinated scheme. With this aim clearly in view, the first question to consider was whether it might be possible to carry out a combined convergent offensive from Palestine and Mesopotamia simultaneously, or whether it was preferable to concen-trate all available forces in one of these theatres, reducing the other for the time being to a purely defensive role.A careful consideration of the Mesopotamia!! situation has convinced me that an offensive from Mesopotamia could not further the main object of the campaign. A local success might, no doubt, be obtained, such as the capture of Mosul, which might be of some value in connection with General Dunsterville&apos;s activities. But to have any effect on the main Turkish armies it would be necessary to advance on Aleppo.   This advance would, from Mosul westwards, be exposed to considerable
danger on its right flank. To secure its left flank it would, probably, also have to move up the line of theJiuphrates. In any case the addition of another 500 miles to our already long line of communications, and the enormous amount of railway construction required, under very great climatic difficulties, appear to me conclusive against such an operation, which, moreover, could only be of service if the force advancing from Palestine could simultaneously reach Aleppo from the south. This General Allenby&apos;s army may not be able to do without substantial reinforcements. If, on the other hand, General Allenby can reach Aleppo it will be impossible for the Turks to maintain any serious force in Mesopotamia, and the task of clearing Mesopotamia will, to a large extent, have been accomplished automatically.These considerations have led me to the conclusion that the only effective co-ordination of the forces in the Turkish theatre lies in the reduction of the force in Mesopotamia to the minimum compatible with reasonable security, in order to concentrate all available resources upon exploiting to the full the very substantial success already achieved in Palestine. The Mesopotamian force is,^ indeed, as favourably situated for defence as it is unfavourably situated for offence.^ The Turkish forces in front of it are weak, and are likely to be reduced still further as General Allenby&apos;s advance progresses. Their communications in rear are defective, ana there is no evidence that the construction of the Baghdad Railway is being pushed on with any vigour. In front they are separated by a broad tract of desert from General MarshalFs force, which holds a line of strong and well-organised defensive positions both on the Euphrates and on the Tigris, as well as further north on the Jebel Plamrin. Beyond holding these positions, which can be done with considerably reduced forces, the only task incumbent upon General Marshall is that of keeping open the Khanikin-Hamadan road on his right flank for the passage of officers, supplies, &amp;c, required by General Dunsterville to enable him to carry out the crgani-sation of local sources of resistance to the Turks in Trans-Caucasia and North -Western Persia.General Marshall has, at present, six infantry divisions, three cavalry brigades, and a number of battalions of line of communication troops. Two of these infantry divisions including the 13th Division, consisting of British troops and one cavalry brigade should be transferred to the Palestine front as soon as the shipping now conveying the 7th Division from Mesopotamia to Palestine is available The same applies to the six batteries of howitzers,from the Italian front, sent to Mesopotamia in order to cope with the anticipated offensive by General von Falkenhayn, and, indeed, to all other personnel, transport, and material now in Mesopotamia or destined for Mesopotamia, which are not absolutely required for maintaining the defence. As many mountain batteries as can be spared from India should also be sent to Palestine. I understand that there are various projects, more particularly of railway construction, under consideration in Mesopotamia which have, in them-selves, much to recommend them, but are not absolutely essential to the maintenance of the reduced force. All these should be postponed, and the material, skilled con-struction, and operating personnel, as well as the unskilled labour, immediately diverted to Palestine. The reductions advocated above may seem large, but they are to my mind essential to making a success of the campaign, and may, indeed, be carried even further at a later stage when General Allenby&apos;s advance approaches Aleppo and draws all available Turkish forces towards him.The conditions for an advance in Palestine and Syria are in almost every respect much more favourable than in Mesopotamia, General Allenby&apos;s force starts at a point much nearer its base and connected with it by a standard gauge railwav which is double tracked for a great part of the way. The left flank of the advance rests upon the sea, a matter of the first importance in connection with the develop-ment of the system of supply and communications, as it makes possible the opening up of supplementary bases in immediate proximity to the front as the advance proceeds. The information I have received from Admiral Jackson and from Commodore Unwin, as well as the actual experience of the supplies regularly landed at Jaffa and on the beach at Nahr Sukhereir, make me believe thai the assistance which the ports and even beaches of the Syrian coast can furnish is much greater than has been surmised at home, or than was allowed for in the estimates of requirements for rolling-stock and railway personnel originally made by the experts who have advised me on railway matters. In addition to the continuation of the standard gauge railway from Egypt, and the development, in connection with it, of the capacities of the ports successively reached, the problem of communications will be [288] c
facilitated by the existence of the Turkish 3-ft. 5^-in. railway system in the interior of the country. The repair and utilisation of this form an essential feature in General Allenby&apos;s plans.ine fact that the left flank of the advance will throughout rest upon the sea is an advantage from the tactical and strategical point of view as well as from that of communications and supply. The navy was able to co-operate most effectively in the bombardment of the Turkish positions at Gaza, and this process can be repeated against every line which the Turks may attempt to hold. Even if a landing in^large force, with a view to threatening the main Turkish line of communications, is precluded by considerations of tonnage and escorts available, it may always be possible at a later stage of the operations to make effective use of landings on a smaller scale more immediately in rear of the enemy&apos;s right flank. While owing to our command of the sea, the Turkish right flank is thus continually in the air and menaced with envelopment, the same applies to his left flank owing to our command of the desert. Here again major operations are excluded by physical conditions as well as by the character of Arab warfare. But minor operations, such as have already been carried out with such extraordinary courage and organising power by Major Lawrence, can be of very real assistance and can be relied upon always to lock up some portion of the Turkish force in guarding the line of communications on that flank.Enjoying this advantage of continually being in a position to threaten both flanks of the enemy General Allenby has, between the sea and the desert, a width of front sufficient to enable him to make the fullest use of his superiority in total numbers, and more especially in mounted troops, over the Turks. He is not tied down to a single line of advance, and is therefore in a position of strategical free-dom essential for that warfare of movement from which the greatest results both in the destruction of the enemy&apos;s forces and in the attainment of geographical objectives are to be obtained. Of these latter, while none can be said to be vital, several, such as Deraa, the key of the Turkish communications into Palestine west-wards, and the great grain-producing area of the Hauran region eastwards, and Damascus, the capital of Syria and the real centre of the Arab-speaking world, are of sufficient importance to be of great moral and material value in themselves, and a temptation to the enemy to incur serious strategical risks in order to hold on to them to the last. Further factors in favour of the advance through Palestine and Syj in are the generally friendly disposition of the inhabitants, from whom, however, it would be unwise to count on any active support till we have actually occupied any particular district, and the by no means inappreciable resources of the country in supplies of all kinds.General Allenby&apos;s plans are based on the full utilisation, as vigorously as physical conditions and the progress of railway construction permit, of the various factors alluded to above and include the following main moves: (a.) An immediate advance to the Jordan on his right flank followed by opera-tions aiming at the destruction of the Hejaz railway and the definite isolation of the Turkish Medina force, and at establishing direct contact with the Arabs.(b.) As soon as weather conditions permit, an advance on the front between the Jordan and the sea towards the Haifa-Lake Tiberias line. This advance is to be supported by the continuation, at the most rapid rate possible, of the standard gauge railway to Haifa and then on northward along the coast. The Turkish railway from the point where the standard gauge ceases to make use of its road bed, and from Haifa to the Jordan and to the Hejaz railway, &quot;will be repaired and utilised as quickly as possible.(c.) One column will then continue to push on up the coast by Es Sur (Tyre) and Beirut, supplied both by the standard gauge railway and by the successive ports which.it opens up, and protected on its right flank by the mountains with a population mainly friendly and likely to prove useful as a source of timely information of Turkish movements. This advance, upon which the bulk of the forces will eventually be con-centrated, will aim at cutting off the Turks at Damascus, or compelling a further retreat, by a move inland. It is possible that a really con-venient point for this move may not be found till the force reaches the
Tripoli-Horns gap, through which it is proposed to carry the railway in order subsequently to link up with the Turkish standard-gauge line north of Horns.(cl.) Simultaneously with the move northwards from Haifa, another force will cross the Jordan and move on Deraa, repairing the Turkish railway m the Yarmuk Valley, and after occupying the Hauran region, will, in con-junction with the&quot; Druses and Arabs, advance along the Hejaz railway on Damascus. This second column will normally be the smaller body, and will move some distance behind the main force, avoiding the risk of inviting a counter-attack in superior force by too hasty an advance. It will, in fact, only push forward as the advance of the main column compels the Turks to transfer their troops to the coastal sector.Touch will be maintained between these two lines of advance by smaller forces operating through the hills of Galilee towards the region north of Lake Tiberias.These movements will constitute the first phase of the operations, the object of which will be to compel the Turks either to evacuate the important centre of Damascus before the inland column, or to accept a decisive battle with the main column in a position more or less parallel to their line of communications. The development of the campaign beyond this point will depend upon the extent to which the Turkish forces may have been weakened by the operations themselves, and the extent to which, as well as the date at which, the Germans may decide to send sub-stantial reinforcements and to take measures to increase the carrying capacity of the single railway line across Asia Minor. This latter, broadly speaking, is the limiting factor to the total numbers which the enemy can bring to bear on the Syrian front, and to the rate at which his reinforcements can be brought up.With the reinforcements from Mesopotamia already referred to, and with the addition of the Indian cavalry now coming from France, General Allenby will have ten infantry divisions and what will amount to four mounted divisions. With these forces, if kept up to strength in drafts, he will be more than able to deal with the whole Turkish force likely to face him in $yria and Palestine, unless and until these are reinforced by any considerable number of Germans. As his line of communi-cations lengthens, and as that of the enemy decreases, it will, however, be desirable to give him such additional reinforcements as may be available. I understand that nineteen or twenty Indian battalions are being formed for him in India, but that the idea is that these should replace a corresponding number of his white battalions, and enable these latter to be used in lieu of drafts for the rest of his force. I would suggest for the most serious consideration of the Government that every effort should be made to keep all, or at least the greater number, of the white units of General Allenby&apos;s force intact, and to make use of the Indians as an additional reinforcement. The drafting requirements for this purpose should not prove very high. The infor-] nation I acquired in Egypt showed me that the Egyptian Expeditionary Force has been most successful not only in returning a high percentage of casualties, both from wounds and sickness, to service in, the country, but also in utilising for active service &quot; B &quot; men sent out with garrison battalions, thus keeping down to a minimum both the net demand for drafts and the demand for shipping both ways. A further reinforcement to be kept in view are the African troops, both British and Belgian, which are now, or may before long, become available from East Africa. These are excellent fighting troops, of great marching powers, and likely to be more particu-larly useful in the hot, malarious Jordan Valley. As the advance continues to draw the Turkish forces towards Syria and away from the other fronts, General Marshall could, as already suggested, send still further reinforcements, while the possibility of troops eventually becoming available from Salonica should not be left out of sight.I have not included in these calculations the French Legion d&apos;Orient now train-mg in Cyprus, or such other forces as the French may wish to send later on to take part in the operations and assert their interests in the settlement of Syria. I do not Know whether it will be more convenient that these should be utilised in a definite region and based on one of the ports, e.g., Beirut or Tripoli, whether or not they are .anded ahead of our own advance, or that they should be directly incorporated in our101CGS.
(C.) RAILWAYS AND PORTS.General Allenby&apos;s prospects of success depend mainly on the rapidity with which his railway construction and repair can be carried out. A slow rate of advance may enable him to push the enemy back a certain distance, at a considerable cost in casualties to his own force. But the advance will sooner or later be brought to a standstill by the gradual increase of enemy reinforcements and by the improvement which the enemy, if given time enough, may be able to effect in his own system of com-munications. Only a rapid rate of advance will give him strategical freedom of action, enable him to follow up any tactical success, and so to achieve results suffi-ciently decisive to influence the general military situation. To secure this rapid rate of construction the force in Palestine should be reinforced by two Canadian railway construction battalions, with all the mechanical equipment which they have with them on the Western front. So essential is it that these skilled troops should come at once that I have already urged most strongly by telegraph that they should be despatched from France forthwith, and replaced there if necessary by other battalions raised in Canada. With these, and adequate unskilled labour, it should be possible to construct the main line at the rate of two miles a day, as against half a mile a day with the more primitive methods at present in use, and to repair, with the least possible delay, the Turkish railway, including the probable reconstruction of the bridges in theTarmuk Valley. There will also be a need for additional operating personnel. In so far as this cannot be furnished by Egypt, Mesopotamia, or India, I suggest that a special appeal should be made to the United States, whose railway operating personnel is probably as great as that of the rest of the world put together.The scheme of standard gauge construction originally recommended by Generals Campbell, Macauley, and Stewart provided for the carrying of the double track, now nearly at Rafa, as far as Haifa, and was based on the assumption that the whole sup-plies of the force would be carried by rail from Egypt. This would have made the force entirely independent of the coast ports, but would have involved for the advance as far as Beirut an addition of 56 engines, 1,120 wagons, 127 miles of track, 1 con-struction battalion, and about 1,200 operating staff, as well as an additional monthly consumption of 1,000 tons of coal. This is as compared with the alterna-tive proposal of suspending double tracking at Rafa, and supplementing the railway by the landing on the coast of an average of about 1,100 tons a day.At a conference which I held at Cairo on the 20th February, at which Admiral Jackson, General Sir G. Macauley, and General Stewart were present, Admiral Jackson informed me that, apart from a determined concentration of hostile sub-marine effort against him, he could undertake to land 1,100 to 1,200 tons a day, pro-viding he could supplement his present total of eighteen trawlers and six drifters with certain additional small craft, more especially for mine-sweeping at Haifa and for patrolling the net which he proposed to put out there. In view of this statement, General Macauley and General Stewart both felt that there was no sufficient justifi-cation for demanding the large additional requirements in rolling stock, material, and personnel involved in the policy of doubling the line to Haifa, and we accord-ingly decided to recommend that the doubling should not be carried out beyond Rafa, which point has practically been reached. This decision was confirmed by the further discussion I had on the subject with Commodore Unwin.With regard to the manner in which the facilities for landing on the coast should be utilised. Admiral Jackson was of opinion that it will be best to continue the present practice by which ships come in the first instance to Egypt, and goods for the force in Palestine are then transferred to smaller vessels, of about 2,000 tons capacity, and escorted by trawlers up the coast. This was also the policy contem-plated by Commodore Unwin, who informed me that he had available, or could lay his hands upon sufficient vessels of the required type, lighters and surf boats to cope with the demand of such a service, at whatever point on the coast may be most con-venient, up to and as far as Beirut. The direct despatch of larger vessels from the United Kingdom or Taranto to Haifa was not recommended by Admiral Jackson. The capacity of Haifa for dealing with traffic would not justify sending whole con-voys there, and any other proceeding was uneconomical in &quot;escorts. Even with a net and mine-sweeping Haifa was not likely to be as secure as the Egyptian ports, and it was therefore preferable only to expose smaller ships to these risks. Lastly, Egypt was still, to a large extent, a distribution centre for other theatres, and this was a
convenient arrangement from the shipping point of view, which would have to be modified if Palestine cargoes had to be kept more strictly separate. These con-siderations appeared to me conclusive, at any rate as regards the immediate future. At a later stage, when both Beirut and Haifa are in our possession, it is possible that the joint capacity of these two ports may be found sufficient to warrant their develop-raent on a large scale, and may then justify the direct despatch of convoys. Such a policy of developing these ports to their maximum capacity would undoubtedly mean a very great shortening of our railway line of communications, and a corresponding saving in rolling-stock and operating personnel for the further advance towards Aleppo.The question of inland water traffic in Egypt is closely associated with the whole railway situation, in so far as it affects the capacity of the Egyptian State Railway to assist the military traffic in Palestine with rolling-stock and personnel. Any assist-ance to this which could be made available from Mesopotamia in the shape of tugs or other craft would correspondingly relieve the general Egypt-Palestine railway situation.The calculations of the railway and supply experts is that a force of 14 divisions (10 infantry and 4 mounted) will require daily 27 trains of 175-215 tons average net capacity; i.e:, 14 for supplies, 3 for carriage of construction materials, 3 for ammuni-tion and stores, 1 for railway coal, 3 for moving of troops, 1 passenger train, and 2 hospital trains. As the carrying capacity of a single line to Haifa is limited to an average maximum of 22 trains, that leaves 1,075 tons, or 5 trainloads, to be landed on the coast. This appears to me a very ample scale of requirements, even allowing for the high proportion of natives arid animals attached to the force. In any case, it does not take into consideration the possibility of securing any relief to the railway situation from local supplies. Even apart from the Hauran, with its great grain-growing capacity, it ought to be possible to turn to account the not inconsiderable resources of Western Palestine, including the Plain of Esdraelon, more particularly in the direction of fodder, which constitutes one of the largest items in the require-ments of the force.Accepting, however, the standard of supplies asked for by General Campbell, the following is the list of the total requirements, up to Beirut and Damascus, of the programme decided upon : Construction Material.Standard (4-/ . S^-in.) gauge track, 75-lb. rails.   261 miles. Of this 146 miles of track, sleepers and accessories are available, being either already in the country or on the way; or 231 miles., if it is decided to take up the existing railway from Alexandria to Dabaa.Turkish 3-ft. h\-in. gauge, 50-Z&amp;. rails.   40 miles. This is assuming that forty out of the eighty miles from Haifa to Deraa will have to be replaced. There is, however, available in the country the line from Ramleh to Beersheba, as well as such sectors of the line, e.g., Ludd to Artuf and part of the line Ludd to Tul Keram, as we may re-lay with standard gauge. This, amounting possibly to over sixty miles of track in all, will be in hand for any excess of destruction of line above the antici-pated 50 per cent., and for repairs from Deraa to Damascus.Skilled Construction Troops. Two battalions of Canadian railway troops from France in addition to skilled construction personnel already in Egypt. With these the construc-tion of the main line at two miles a day and the repair of the Turkish line should be assured, provided that sufficient labour and material are on the spot.Engines and Rolling-Stock.Standard Gauge.   154 engines.   3,080 ten-ton waggons.-These are additional to engines and rolling-stock now in use.   Of the waggons about 1,500 should be box trucks. [288] D
Turkish Line.   40 engines.   350 ten-ton waggons. This would enable twelve trains daily to operate on the line Haifa-Damascus.   These trains are calculated to maintain two divisions.Operating Personnel.For the working of the main line to Beirut and of the Turkish line a total addition of fifteen sections or 3,960 men will be required.Coal.Present monthly consumption for the railway is 6,000 tons. Another 4,000 tons will be required when the main line reaches Haifa, and 5,000 tons more when railheads reach Beirut and Damascus.(D.)-UNSKILLED LABOUR,Both for railway construction and for the work of landing stores on the coast a large increase in unskilled labour will have to be provided, estimated by General Macauley for his requirements as an additional 19,500, and by Commodore Unwin as an additional 3,000 men, or 22,500 in all. It appears to me that by additional recruiting for the Egyptian Labour Corps, which is doing admirable work, by the transfer of all labour that can now be spared from Mesopo-tamia, by further recruiting, if necessary, in India, and by the fullest possible utilisation of Turkish prisoners, there ought to be no difficulty in meeting the above, or considerably greater demands. With regard to the Turkish prisoners, there are, I gather, still a considerable number of these in Egypt and Cyprus not engaged on work of great importance, as well as some 4,000 at Salonika engaged upon the construction of a railway line to Stavros, the whole or greater part of whom may, I hope, soon become available. In this connection I would like to point out that both the capacity and willingness of prisoners to do good work depends on their being1 given as full a scale of rations as is required to maintain the energies of voluntary workers, as well as such other inducements as are custom-aryto stimulate their efforts.(E.)-LIGHT RAILWAYS AND ROAD TRANSPORT.It is essential to the strategic freedom of General Allenby&apos;s force that he should be able to operate at a considerable distance from rail-head. He has already in Egypt, or on order, a sufficiency of 60-centimetre and 2-ft. 6-in. line and rolling-stock (the 2-ft. 6-in. material previously earmarked for Mesopotamia but now counter-manded) to enable him to assist an advance and to maintain his forces over the width of front required. But he will require a substantial addition to his road transport organisation, and this has been estimated by General Campbell at ten auxiliary Petrol Companies with workshops and personnel complete. It should be possible to obtain a portion of the above from Mesopotamia.(F.) AVIATION.My inspection of the aerodromes at Heliopolis and Aboukir, as well as my discussions with General Salmond, have strengthened my conviction that Egypt is an eminently suitable place for air training, and that it should be the training school, not only for the Air Service in the Middle East, but also for large numbers of pilots intended for the European front.Weather conditions as well as terrain are ideal for continuous training purposes, and much relief could thus be given to the congested conditions of our aerodromes in England. The possibility of relieving shipping difficulties in this connection by establishing aerodromes in Crete and at Sollum on the African coast, which would enable machines to be flown from England to Egypt, and perhaps also to Salonika and Mudros both from England and Egypt, is, at any rate, worth examining.As regards offensive operations, Constantinople, and to some extent also the railway line and dumps in Thrace and Asia &quot;Minor, supply suitable targets.   The
aerodromes at Mudros and Imbros should be the centre of bombing squadrons capable of carrying out continuous attacks by night and day against these objectives. When the force is reinforced by an additional two divisions, General Salmond con-siders that he will require an additional two squadrons in Palestine (one R.E. 8 and one D.H. 9). These and other proposals of General Salmond I shall discuss with the Air Council and Air Policy Committee.(G.) SHIPPING.The transfer to Palestine of troops, labour, and material from Mesopotamia, once accomplished, should involve no appreciable recurrent addition of shipping. Supplies and troops from India would have to come somewhat further, but a much greater distance would be saved in the case of supplies and troops from the United Kingdom. The only items of the programme advocated which involve heavy initial demands for shipping are the additional aeroplanes, the ten auxiliary Petrol Companies, and the requirement, based upon the standard of supply laid down by General Campbell, of 154 engines and 3,080 waggons standard gauge, and forty engines and 350 waggons 3-ft. 5^-in. gauge. These, or such reduced figure as may be decided upon, would have to be in the country by the time the army reached the line Beirut-Damascus. Only 64 engines and 1,280 trucks (subject to reduction as above) are required as far as Haifa, or proportionately less if the advance to Haifa is completed before the two extra divisions from Mesopotamia are actually used in Palestine. In either case it has been assumed that the total supplies landed at the coast ports will not exceed&apos;1,100 tons a day. After Beirut, the opening up of that port and the further development of Haifa, may enable the rolling-stock then available to sustain the further advance. Apart from the provision of rolling-stock, the only substantial recurrent items of increased tonnage necessitated by the proposed operations are the coal for working the railway, additional railway or port construction material above the requirements already referred to, and such engineering and signal stores, ammunition, remounts and reinforcements, as are involved in prosecuting active operations.A considerable volume of shipping, 30 ships, sufficient for the transport of 1^ divisions, is at present kept in the Mediterranean for strategic contingencies. Urgent as is the need for shipping in every direction, I would strongly urge that this reserve be maintained. In the first place, even if landing operations on a large scale are not contemplated, minor landings at no great distance from the main advance along the coast may in certain contingencies exercise a most important effect upon the operations. From a broader point of view, the possibility of being able in an emergency suddenly to transport additional troops to Palestine from Mesopotamia or Salonika, or from Palestine to either of those theatres, is of the greatest importance, and constitutes both a valuable safeguard and a potential enhancement of our offensive power in the whole Eastern theatre of war, where, in spite of submarine risks, we enjoy the advantage of a system of inner, or at any rate more rapid, lines of local intercommunication as compared with our enemies. Lastly there are political contingencies, such as a Turkish request for rapid help to secure Constantinople against a Bulgar attack, in the event of Turkey abandon-ing the German alliance, which it will not be wise to leave altogether out of sight.(H.)-POLICY ATSLD STRATEGY.The note of the Military Representatives to the Supreme War Council on the campaign of 1918 laid special stress on the necessity that strategy and policy should go closely hand in hand in the operations against Turkey. I have discussed this matter fully with Sir R. Wingate, with General Allenby, General Clayton, Colonel Storrs, and others, and have no hesitation in endorsing the view taken by the Military Representatives as to the importance of a careful adjustment of our political to our military action. There are, in this connection, several points which require careful watching. It is essential in the first place, that nothing should be done which might upset our Arab Allies, whose military usefulness is being increasingly felt, and may assume yet greater importance as we get in touch with the Hauran and the powerful tribes east of Damascus. The Turks are working bard to detach them from us, and are making the most of the openings afforded them
by our declaration with, regard to Zionism, and by the publication of the Sykes-Picot agreement. With regard to the former, it is important that we should make it quite clear that the reservations in the declaration with regard to the rights of the existing population of Palestine are seriously meant. We should, in any case, avoid anything savouring of an active carrying out of Zionist schemes in Palestine till we can give the Arabs an earnest in practice, as we advance, of our good faith towards them by our recognition of their position in Damascus and Syria generally. This, of course, raises, in the most direct form, the question of the Sykes-Picot agreement of May 1916, and of the effect of its publication upon the Arabs. This document has undoubtedly been taken by the Arabs as implying the conversion of a great part of Syria, including the whole coast region, into a French Colony, and this has greatly increased the distrust of our Allies which, for one reason and another, the Arabs have already entertained. Nothing could help our prospects more in that respect than an explicit disavowal by France of such designs, or of any ambitions beyond that of exercising a helpful guidance in the building up of a self-governing Arab community or group of communities. It will be no less necessary, before long, to make up our minds clearly as to what is the maximum of concession which we can afford to make to the Turks for the sake of a separate peace, without abandoning the general policy to which we are already committed with regard to the Arabs.As regards the Turks themselves, our soundest course must be, while hammer-ing their armies, to bring home to them by every means, public and private, that we do not mean to deprive them of Constantinople or of any part of their present Empire in Europe as well as in Asia, in which the Turkish race forms a majority, and that we are willing to concede economic and financial terms which would enable a Turkish national State to start after the war with a good prospect of attaining economic independence and prosperity. It is by no means impossible that the stress which German propagandists have laid upon Turkish nationalism in the interests of the so-called Pan-Turanian movement may not, in the end, have served a useful purpose by inducing the Turks to acquiesce more easily in the substitution of a Turkish national State for the present Ottoman Empire. The most serious difficulty in the way of any actual move for peace on the part of the Turks them-selves is their realisation that any revolution aiming at peace might expose Constantinople to the danger of seizure by a German-Bulgar army before the Turkish forces themselves could be withdrawn from, the front to defend it. This may necessitate on our part, not only connivance at the withdrawal of Turkish troops from in front of us, but even, in certain contingencies, prompt military and naval intervention at whatever point our sympathisers among the Turks may most need it.(I.)-CONCLUSION.In conclusion I wish to express my very great indebtedness to Brig.-General Stewart,&apos; Colonel W. Kirke, and Lieut.-Colonel L. S. Amery for the invaluable assistance they have given me in my work.I attach hereto copies of the principal telegrams I addressed to the War Cabinet and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, notes of my conferences with Admiral Jackson and Commodore Unwin, as well as recommendations of Generals Marshall and Gillman in regard to the Mesopotamian campaign. General Gillman wrote his report before my discussions with him, and it is interesting to note by what reasoning he and General Marshall arrived independently at the same conclusions as myself in regard to the further prosecution of that campaign.J. C. SMUTS.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., March 1, 1918.
ANNEX  IFrom General Smuts to Chief Imperial General Staff, War Office, London. (Despatched from G.H.Q., Egypt, on 15th February, 1918.)A, oFebruary 15.Please communicate the following to Sir Maurice Hankey for information of War Cabinet.Begins. I have discussed following plan of future operations in Palestine and Mesopotamia with Allenby, who is in agreement with recommendations set out below. I unexpectedly had advantage of meeting at Alexandria, General Hopwood, Maude&apos;s Chief General Staff, and discussing situation in Mesopotamia with him. He also appeared personally to favour following proposals. Gillman, Marsh all&apos;s Chief General Staff, will arrive at Cairo on the 20th February, and I am anxious to l)e in position on his arrival to settle and explain both to him and Allenby future policy to be followed in Syria and Mesopotamia. As I hope to leave Egypt on Thursday, 21st, on my return journey, it is considered desirable that War Cabinet should consider my following recommendations as soon as possible and authorise me to state definitely to them before leaving policy of Cabinet in regard to these campaigns. Thereafter Chief Imperial General Staff could follow up the matter with formal instructions.It is impossible to continue the offensive on both Syrian and Mesopotamian frouts as neither force is separately strong enough to go far enough. One force will have to go definitely on the defensive and feed the other with reinforcements of everything surplus to its reasonable requirements for defence. Mesopotamia Force is one which should become purely defensive, because of its excessive distance from Aleppo, the danger of lengthening the lines of communication, its excessive require-ments in railway construction along both the Euphrates and Tigris, and danger to its right flank if it proceeds beyond Mosul. It has at present very strong defensive positions both on Euphrates and on Tigris, between Samara and Baghdad, as well as further north on Jebel Hamrin,&apos; which positions can be held with reduced forces. Route from Mosul to North-V/estern Persia should be closed by small detachments working in conjunction with local tribesmen and levies at present being organised by Dunsterville. Marshall has six infantry divisions, three cavalry brigades, and four-teen battalions of L. of C. troops. Of these two infantry divisions, including 13th Division, consisting of British troops, together with one Cavalry Brigade, should be definitely earmarked for Allenby and transferred to Palestine front. This also applies to six batteries of howitzers from Italian front now in Mesopotamia.Allenby will then have ten infantry divisions, one Indian cavalry division now coming from France, and one cavalry brigade from Mesopotamia, in addition to his present three mounted divisions. With these he will be prepared to undertake as vigorous an offensive as progress of railway construction and physical conditions will permit. His plans will include (a) an immediate advance to the Jordan, and thereafter the demolition of the Hedjaz railway so as to isolate Turkish Medina force and support Arabs; (b) an advance as soon as weather conditions permit towards Haifa and Tiberias line; (c) construction of broad gauge railway at rapidest possible rate to Haifa and thence northward along the coast to Es Sur or Tyre and Beirut, or further to most convenient point from which to turn Damascus position through the mountains. This may have to be through Tripoli-Horns gap. His main force will advance with this railway and Haifa Tyre Beirut, and all convenient ports will be developed en route to assist his transport situation; (d) restoration and. repair of Turkish line from Haifa via El Fule and Yarmuk to Hedjaz railway in order to support smaller column which will follow this route towards Damascus, and m conjunction with Arabs and Druses occupy Hauran area. This second column will move some distance behind the main force and avoid counter-attacks in superior iorce by the enemy. Other smaller forces will operate through hills of Galilee towards the north of Lake Tiberias. The advance of the main column along the coast will facilitate supplies, will.be protected on the right flank by the mountains witn friendly population, and should render it impossible for enemy&quot; to hold on long m strength to any centre in the interior such as Deraa or Damascus, as his retreat will be therely endangered.[288] &quot; ^ E
Allenby will be more than able to deal with whole present Turkish force in Palestine and Syria if his above strength is maintained in drafts. Nineteen or twenty battalions are being formed for him in India, but it is a serious question whether, in addition to these, every effort should not be made to keep all his white battalions intact and as full as possible with drafts from home. Hope to send rough estimate of requirements later. As this northern advance proceeds and enemy force increases on Syrian front and weakens on Mesopotamian front, Marshall could still further reinforce Allenby, and this seems to me the only way in which the two campaigns could be effectively co-ordinated. The reinforcement of Allenby by African troops from Eas  Africa or the Congo, more particularly for use in the tropical Jordan valley, and, perhaps, also eventually from Salonika should be borne in mind. The total Turkish forces in all theatres are, of course, still considerable, but it should be borne in mind that the single railway line through Asia Minor is the limiting factor to the numbers which the enemy can bring to and supply on the Syrian front. Allenby &apos;s most serious difficulty in rapid advance will be railway construction and transport. I am sending separate telegrams to War Office giving details of his requirements in these respects based on joint advice of Generals Campbell, Macauley, and Stewart. To summarise their recommendations, Allenby will want for transport ten additional auxiliary petrol companies with workshops and personnel complete. Construction of standard gauge railway at rate of two miles per day with double track as far as Haifa and single track from then onwards, together with repairs of Turkish railway from Haifa on to and including Hejaz railway, will require two battalions of Canadian railway troops, and many thousands of unskilled labour. Two Canadian battalions could only come in time from those already in France, and I urge most strongly that this be ordered at once, and that they should be replaced, if necessary, in France by fresh battalions recruited in Canada.Every effort will be made to utilise Turkish prisoner labour and to recruit additional unskilled labour in Egypt and locally, but the possibility may have to be faced that part at any rate of additional requirements will have to be met from India. All railway construction in Mesopotamia should be definitely stopped, and all available labour, skilled and unskilled, as wrell as material, should be transferred to this front. As regards additional railway track, locomotives and waggons, I was assured by Sir Guy Granet in Rome that they could be supplied provided he is advised ii time to make necessary arrangements.Of total requirements wired separately, certain amount can be found in Egypt or has already been indented for by General Macauley. About these I hope to send another wire in a couple of days. The balance will have to be found by Granet. I am personally in doubt about necessity of doubling standard track as far as Haifa. It must be remembered that in proportion as ports above-named can be effectively developed, advantage of double track and demand for rolling stock will be reduced. Admiral Jackson is sanguine that both Haifa and Beirut can be developed for a very good rate of traffic. Large demand of coal for military should be met from South Africa via the East Coast as much as possible.It must be realised by the War Cabinet that the policy indicated above will entail a large initial and some permanent increase in tonnage as compared with purely defensive policy. It is with object of enabling shipping requirements to be calculated that I am sending fullest possible estimates of main requirements.

End of message.ANNEX III.From General Smuts to Chief Imperial General Staff.X. 12.February 20.Begins. At a Conference which I held to-day with Admiral J ackson and General Macauley, the relative advantages of the following main alternatives were con-sidered: (a) doubling of the railway to Haifa, (&amp;) doubling to Rafa only, and dependence on coast ports for balance of requirements, a minimum average of 1,000 tons per diem. It was decided to adopt the second alternative, it being understood from Admiral Jackson that he could guarantee landing the above amount subject to some addition to his present total of trawlers and drifters now operating on the coast.   This decision involves adoption of smaller programme of rolling-stock,* Two battalions will still be required; three would have been required for double track programme. This was not quite clear in the text of the telegram.
material, and personnel, referred to my telegram No. X. 5, of the 15th. With refer-ence to your telegram 52606, para. 1, to meet 261 miles shown as required in my statement, there are already available in country 146 miles* 75-lb. rails with sleepers and other accessories, in addition to 85 miles of line Alexandria to Debaa. Para. 2: Any addition over amount already estimated can be got by taking up Turkish line further south. Para. 3: Two construction battalions will cover revised requirements. Para. 4: One in a hundred. Para. 5: 22 trains. Para. 6: Personnel asked for included maintenance. It was calculated for double standard line and did not include Turkish line, but would cover single line plus Turkish line.Ends.   End of message.ANNEX IV.General Smuts to Colonel Hankey.X. 13.February 21.Begins: Have discussed Mesopotamia situation fully with Gillman. Marshall agrees that he can release two more divisions if he remains on defensive on present front. Gillman sees no difficulty about also releasing one cavalry brigade. If Marshall has to move to Mosul he will want all his present force. But Gillman considers my proposal best on the whole. Mesopotamia will also help Palestine with unskilled labour not now required to continue Euphrates railway.There is now I hope no difficulty in sanctioning my proposals. I leave here to-night and Alexandria to-morrow.  Ends.ANNEX V.Methods by which the Force in Mesopotamia can Co-operate with the Force in Palestine, and Operations possible in Mesopotamia.Memorandum by Major-General W. Gillman.Ref. Map of Eastern Turkey in Asia, 1/2,000,000.1. Three Methods of Co-operation.There are three ways in which our force in Mesopotamia can assist that in Palestine (a.) By advancing up the Euphrates,(&amp;.) By advancing up the Tigris,(c.) By transferring part of the force to Palestine.The first method would, on our reaching Meskene (east of Aleppo), have a direct effect by threatening the Turkish line of communication in Palestine.The effect of the second method would be rather of an indirect nature, and would consist in taking or threatening Mosul, and in retaining in that area the Turkish troops now opposing us, as well as possibly in drawing off others in order to stop our further advance. It would compel the Turkish forces now operating between the Jebel Hamrin and Lake Urmia to fall back northwards from the Persian frontier, thus facilitating any developments we may wish to initiate in that direction.The third method needs no comment.2. Railway Problems.In the first two methods the underlying difficulty is one of railway construction and of the supply of locomotives and rolling-stock, more especially&apos; of standard gauge which are, it is understood, obtainable only in England, where the demand* As a matter of fact, fifty-nine of these were still en route when the telegram was sent[288] j?
at present is greatly in excess of the supply. It would appear advisable, therefore, to make the railway situation clear before the merits and demerits of the above methods are discussed.(a.) Standard Gauge.There are 106 miles of standard gauge track in the country, and 44 more &quot;are on order in India.Tigris Route. As far as the Tigris route is concerned, a further 50 miles of track would enable us to join Samarra with Mosul. The rate of laying this track is problematical, but up to the Jebel Hamrin it should be possible to lay a surface line at the rate of 1 mile a day. Be3rond that ridge the ground is more broken, and it is doubtful if more than half-a-mile a day could be counted on. As an approximate estimate, it may be assumed that the track to Shoreimieh would be laid in two months and to Mosul in about nine months.In rolling-stock, we have enough to work the line up to Shoreimieh, and it is calculated that for the working of the whole line to Mosul an extra 18 locomotives and 180 trucks would be required, two-thirds of that amount being sufficient for supply as far as the Greater Zab.Euphrates Route. As regards a line along the Euphrates, Meskene is about 700 miles from the nearest point of the Busra-Nasrie railway and about 400 miles from Feluja. The line to Nasrie is laid on standard gauge sleepers with heavy rails, and could be used for this gauge with little trouble if required.Assuming that work began simultanously at Feluja and Nasrie, and that a surface track along the desert could be laid at the rate of 1 mile a day, a period of 400 days must elapse before the track reached Meskene, during the first 300 days of which all the material required at Feluja and beyond must come up the Tigris to Baghdad and be forwarded thence by rail.Each mile of track requires 300 tons of shipping, which means that approxi-mately one-seventh of the total tonnage now landed at Baghdad would for a period of 300 days be utilised in supplying this railway material.The difficulties of obtaining the necessary locomotives and rolling-stock in England, and the shortage of shipping, would in any case appear to prohibit the idea of constructing a line of this gauge at the present time.(b.) Metre Gauge.135 miles of metre gauge are in the country or on order, and it is estimated that 100 miles per month can be turned out in India. Rolling-stock should also be available in that country. Each mile of track requires 250 tons of shipping, so that the problems of shipping and of forwarding up river would be lessened but little as compared with standard gauge plant, The time taken to lay the line would be approximately the same.a3. Deductions from Railway Considerations.Owing to the time required to lay the track, and to the difficulties of supply, it does not appear possible that any line up the Euphrates can be completed in time to enable direct assistance to be given to the force in Palestine before April 1919.As regards the line to Mosul the continuation of a standard gauge track beyond Samarra presents no difficulty except as regards the extra locomotives and rolling-stock required. An addition of 12 engines and 120 trucks would enable railhead to be established opposite the junction of the Tigris and Greater Zab by the end of October 1918. The question of a further continuance of the line either into Mosul or on to Nisibin must be a matter for subsequent decision based on the policy at the time and on the rolling-stock available. No outside labour would be required for laying any line.4. Various Offensive Measures. (a.) An Offensive to the North-East.To the north-east our policy has recently been affected by the necessity of keeping the road open to Kermanshah, and to possible developments in Northern Persia. For these reasons, we have lately occupied Kasrishirin, which is inside the Persian frontier, and have placed small posts to guard and keep in repair the Kermanshah road as far as the Tak-i-Girrah Pass.
The Turks occupy Kifri and have posts along the right bank of the Diala as far down as Kara Tepe. Their line of supply and of retirement (as obtained from captured documents) is via Tuz Khurmatli Kirkuk Erbil.A railway runs to the Jebel Hamrin a few miles north-east of Shahroban. It was originally 2-ft. 6-in. gauge, but as metre gauge track arrived it was sub-stituted for the narrower gauge, and the line is now (1st February) metre gauge as far as Bakuba, and will be continued as such to Khanikin. The 2-ft. 6-in. track is being laid northwards from Bakuba to feed the troops on the Deli Abbas-Sindia line, and it is under contemplation to continue this line up to the vicinity of the Band i Adhaim Pass in case it is decided to take and hold Kifri.The advantages of taking Kifri would be to drive the Turks further away from the Persian frontier, to make use of the coal mine, and to make good the initial stage of a subsequent advance on Mosul. There is ample water on the Kifri-Erbii road, and it would be used by one column while another moved up the Tigris see sub-paragraph (b) below.(b.) An offensive^to the North.Up the Tigris a standard gauge line runs from Baghdad as far as Samarra. At Ashik our defences are strong, and are echeloned back in depth as far as Beled. It is also at Ashik that the River Tigris may be said to leave the foot hills and enter the plain of Irak, so that we are now in a position to control the flood waters of that river. As far as the Jebel Hamrin the country has no agricultural future owing to difficulties of irrigation, and above Samarra the rocky bed of the Tigris renders it unsuitable for navigation.There are at present no Turks other than patrols south of the Jebel Hamrin, and there is in consequence no difficulty in advancing to Tekrit and conveying supplies there during the dry weather, but if a further advance is decided on, the railway must be pushed forward as our troops advance. The Jebel Hamrin is held strongly, and unless it is intended to push on to Mosul, there does not appear to be any object in driving the Turks off that ridge in the vicinity of Shoreimieh. We do not gain much by pushing our line, which runs from just north of Deli Abbas to Ashik, on to the line Kifri-Kala Jebaar.Mosul is the headquarters of the Turkish 6th Army under Halil. This com-prises the 13th and 18th Army Corps, the former being in the area Kifri-Erbil, and the latter in the area Shoreimieh-Bilalik. Their total strength is about 18,500 rifles, 131 guns, and a proportion of other arms. There are in addition 2 frontier battalions in the vicinity, one at Sulaimania and the other near Rowanduz.The capture of Mosul, coupled with the defeat of Halil&apos;s army, would be a great blow to Turkish prestige, and would deny to the enemy a large and fertile area from which they have hitherto drawn the bulk of their foodstuffs. It would affect seriously, if not put a stop to, Turkish interference in the country between the Jebel Hamrin and Lake Urmia, and would cause the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the proximity of the Persian frontier.To enable an advance on Mosul to be carried out, it is essential that the railway up the Tigris should be pushed forward at least as far as the Greater Zab, as both the column moving up the Tigris and that moving north from Kifri would be fed from it by means of auxiliary methods of supply, such as Ford van companies and mule columns.The disadvantages of capturing Mosul are that it would entail our holding a very acute salient with an increase to our already long lines of communications, and by bringing us nearer Turkish, railhead would facilitate their powers of supply and reinforcement from the west.(c.) An Offensive towards Hit.The Turkish troops near Hit amount to 3,250 rifles, etc., and 1,650 more rifles may be on their way. A scheme for capturing the town has been prepared, and should give no difficulty. The capture of the garrison, which is chiefly aimed at, is a more difficult problem, as the Turks are now very much on the alert, and are not likely to be surrounded again as they were at Ramadie.At Ramadie we are in a position to control the flood waters of the Euphrates. By going on to Hit we gain possession of the bitumen wells in the intervening area, and the rocky river bed through which the Euphrates enters the Mesopotamian plain, which may be of use in subsequent bridging operations.[288]G
CONCLUSION.With the troops and means available, the Mesopotamian Force can push forward, though not simultaneously, to Kifri, Tekrit, and Hit, but owing to the difficulties connected with supply, it may not be possible to stay in these forward positions till the present railways are-extended.No serious opposition against these advances is expected from the Turks. Our troops will, however, be called upon to prepare a new defensive line at the com-mencement of the hot season.With the railway material at present available, General Marshall considers that he can push forward the standard gauge line up the Tigris as far as Shoreimieh, and a small gauge line due north to the Jebel Hamrin from Bakuba. He can then seize and hold the line Kasrishirin-Tuz Khurmatli-Lesser Zab, and at the same time spare one division for operations elsewhere.Given priority of railway rolling-stock to enable a line to be worked as far as the Greater Zab or beyond, he is prepared to go on to Mosul, but in that contingency he cannot spare a division from his force.If a purely defensive policy is laid down for his force, he. considers that he can hold with four divisions the ground he now occupies against the enemy at present ofjposed to him, thus sparing&apos;two divisions for service elsewhere.(Signed)   W. GILLMAN,Major-General, C.G.S.February 6, 1918.ANNEX VI.Notes on a Conference held at Cairo on the 20th Febmary, 1918, with Admiral Jackson and General Macauley on Policy of Railway and Sea Transport for the Force in Palestine.1. The relative advantages of the following main alternatives were first con-sidered-(a.) Doubling of the railway to Haifa.(&amp;.) Doubling to Rafa only and dependence on coast ports for balance of require-ments, a minimum average of 1,100 tons per diem.It was decided that the second alternative would be preferable if Admiral Jackson considered that he could guarantee the naval portion of the programme. This he thought he could do with his existing trawlers and drifters.2. In regard to the policy decided upon, two further alternatives were then con-sidered (a.) Continuance of present system by which all ships were taken in the first instance to one of the Egyptian ports, and cargoes for Syrian ports then transhipped into vessels averaging 2,000 tons.(6.) Possibility of running ocean-going steamers direct into Haifa, and so saving transhipment in Egypt.Admiral Jackson preferred the first alternative for the following reasons: (i.) Economy in escorts. Ships were moved to Egypt on the convoy system, which would not be economical in the case of Haifa, as it would mean great delays in unloading, and would also expose valuable ships unneces-sarily to submarine attack, (ii.) Convoys to Egypt conveyed stores not only.for Palestine but for Mesopo-tamia-, Salonica, &amp;c. The loading of ships to proceed direct to Haifa might add further complications, and therefore delay.
3. Admiral Jackson stated that he thought he would be able to land the required amount of stores at Haifa with his five existing transports, and could protect them, given additional trawlers and drifters.Note. With regard to the guarantee mentioned in para. 1, Admiral Jackson wishes this to be considered as subject to the proviso that there is no hostile activity to prevent the naval programme being carried out, in the absence of which he considers that the minimum average can be attained.ANNEX VII.Memorandum of Conference between General Smuts and Commodore  Unwin, P.N.T.O., Eastern Mediterranean, at Taranto, on the 25th February, 1918.With reference to the question whether the doubling of the railway line beyond Rafa could be avoided if the landing of an average of 1,100 tons a day on the coast could be assured, Commodore Unwin said that he could give a reasonable assurance as far as he personally was concerned, but could not, of course, assume the responsi-bility which properly belonged to higher authorities. In his opinion, he could land at least 2.000 tons a day, and, indeed, 3,000 a day, on one beach when weather per-mitted. There was always risk of work being stopped for a week or ten days by weather. From the experience of last summer it might be estimated that work would be stopped six or seven days a month during the summer months. In view of the above, he considered that a minimum of 1,100 tons could be reasonably assured.In respect of the number of days on which supplies could be landed, Jaffa was better than Nahr Sukhereir, and Haifa would be considerably better than either. Commodore Unwin suggested that if cribs were built in Egypt and sunk in continua-tion of the projection of Mount Carmel to form a breakwater, landing at Haifa might take place almost continuously. Piers, though advantageous, were not necessary at Haifa, as landing could be managed from surf boats, but a breakwater, if feasible from an engineering point of view, would be a great advantage. *Beirut was much better than Haifa, and could, in his opinion, be developed up to a maximum of 4,000 tons a day.As regards craft, he had, or could lay his hands upon, sufficient surf boats and lighters. He proposed to use 9 vessels fr r transport, 3 of which would be discharg-ing, 3 loading, and 3 in transit. This would allow for a proportion being out of action at any one time. Some of thesf: would be L. lighters (dismantled sailing vessels), which could be towed, and which he thought might, if the naval authorities approved, sail without escort, as they were of little value beyond the cargo they carried. To carry out this general programme effectively it was necessary that ships should not be held back for want of escorts or cargoes.As regards labour, Commodore Unwin was entirely willing to fall in with General CampbelFs suggestion that he should have his own own labour. At present he had some 2,000 men, but would require a total of 5,000. This would enable him to put stores right up to the dump, as at present, without the necessity of employing any M.L.O.&apos;s staff. He would be well satisfied if Turkish prisoner labour were allotted to him for the purpose; the military authorities could decide whether they preferred that the Turkish prisoner labour should be used in Palestine or at Kantara. In the latter case the Egyptian Labour Corps there would be released for Palestine. The prisoners would in either case; remain under the military authorities for pur-poses of discipline, but he suggested that the P.N.T.O. should be free to fix rates of pay, gratuities, and scales of rations to stimulate good work. This labour did not include the 600 surf boatmen, for which work he doubted if the Turks were suitable^ He would, in fact, have to call upon Egypt for another 600 of these.o* General Stewart considered that there would be no difficulty in putting down such cribs, filled with rock, at any rate out to a depth of 30 feet.
