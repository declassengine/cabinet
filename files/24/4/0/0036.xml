The Report was never finally signed, although action has been taken on praotically all the recommendations.The War Cabinet will remember that, on January 9f they hadbefore them a Draft for discussionn     On that date Colo?jel Arasryarrived from Versailles with criticisms of some of the figures,which were accordingly remitted for discussion between the Ministryof national Service and the Adjutant General !s Department withGeneral Smuts in the Chair.     The results of General Smuts1 Inquirywere circulated on January 17 (m.p.0.30) in a form prepared witha view to its incorporation as a separate Part V of the Report.The Draft Report was again laid before the War Cabinet on January22, but, owing to an important subsidiary Man-Power question,relating to the supply of labour for shipyards, was again notdiscussed in detail.     Since that date the moment has never beenpropitious for finally winding up the Inquiry. There have been negotiations with the United States of America for incorporatingAmerican battalions in British brigades; negotiations with TradesUnions; with the aa3cs.; and with Miners; and it has always beenpossible that it might be necessary to re-open tho whole question.The recent enemy offensive has now entirely altered the wholesituation, and the Draft Report is now only of historical value asa stage in the development of the Mian-Power question.The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whom I have consulted on the question, think that, in the circumstances, particularly having regard to the fact that Sir Edward Carson, who was a Member of the Man-Power Committee, has left the Government, the Report should remain a Draft and not &quot;be finally signed.     If this view is accepted I suggest that the enclosed version should be regarded as the final stage reached in an incomplete Inquiry, the- whole scope of which has been altered by recent events.This version was actually sent to the Printer on March 1* It incorporates General Smuts1 Report as a separate Part V.     It also includes, in the form of notes, some figures sent in by the General ctaff after the Conclusions of the Committee had been reached.     I thought it advisable to include, not only the new figures, but also the old figures, since the latter were those on which the Conclusions were reached, and have been used, to some extent, by the Prime Minister and the Minister of national service as the basis of statements in Parliament and elsewhere The other corrections are of a minor character to meet a fev; criticisms made oither in papers circulated to the &quot;far Cabinet or verbally to me.(Signed). u.p0a.baj!key.^u^MJQMJ-l^erdens, S .7^1,

Part I.-INTRODUCTORY.The present inquiry into the question of man-power differs, in this the fourth&apos;year of the war, from previous similar inquiries in two important particulars, one military, and the other civilian. From a military point of view it differs in so far as the collapse of Russia has shut the Allies off from what was numerically their largest source of man-power; the loss of Russian man-power can-not be compensated during the year 1918, in a numerical sense at any rate, by the accession of strength from the United States of America. From a civilian point of view the conditions of this inquiry differ from previous inquiries in so far as the adverse effects on the economic situation of a great and steady drain on the most robust manhood of the country, which it was always fore-seen must appear sooner or later, instead of being prospective, are now making themselves felt in this, as in all the belligerent countries. In the absence of any prospect of an early military decision the civilian aspects of our man-power must be carefully safeguarded in order to support the staying-power of the Allies, which is still dependent, to a very great extent, on the resources of this country, notwithstanding that the United States of America now share the burden with us.2. In order to ascertain the degree of importance to be attached to the maintenance of British military man-power as a factor in the military problem with which the Allies are confronted, the Committee commenced their inquiry by an examination of the man-power problem of the Allies as a whole. To assist them in this part of their inquiry they were supplied by the General Staff with an estimate of the strength of the opposing forces (M.P.C.-5), and the Director of Military Intelligence and Adjutant-General attended to give such further explanations as the Committee required. The results of this part of the inquiry will now be examined.Part II.-A COMPARISON OF ALLY AND ENEMYMAN-POWER.Note. After the provisional conclusions recorded in Part VI had been reached some of the figures in Part II were amended by the General Staff. The original tables, which formed the data on which the Committee based their recommendations, have been retained, but the revised tables are printed a,s foot-notes, the alterations in the text being shown in square brackets.3. A full comparison of Ally and enemy man-power on each of the fronts is attached for convenience of reference in Annex I. The main importance of the figures for the Eastern front, from the point of view of the present inquiry, consists in the degree to which they constitute a reservoir from which the enemy can draw reinforcements to the Western and Italian fronts. The figures for the Balkan and Turkish fronts have each a strategical significance and interest to which the attention of the War Cabinet has been drawn independently, but, from the point of view of the present inquiry, they are of rela-tively minor interest. The figures for the Western and Italian fronts, however, vitally affect the British problem of military man-power, and these must, therefore, be reproduced in the body of this Report.4. The existing strength of the Allies and of the enemy on the Western and Italian fronts, after allowing for the reinforcements sent by Great Britain and France to Italy and for several German divisions brought from the Eastern to the Western front, is shown in the following tables. It should be particularly noted that the figures, as given, are not nominal establishments, but actual [1280] B
numbers, and take into account existing shortages in establish-ments so far as these are known: *Table (A).

It will be observed that on the Western front the Allies have an existing superiority of eighteen and a half divisions, 1.316,000 [884,000] combatants and 1,626,000 ration strength. It should be noted that, notwithstanding this great numerical superiority, the Allies have not succeeded in breaking the German front. On the Italian front the Allies have a superiority equiva-leht to eleven divisions, 513,000 [409,000] combatants and 623,000 ration strength.6. In the course of the year 1918 the above figures are liable to very considerable alteration, and it is necessary to form an estimate of the extent of this.7. The most important new factor in the man-power problem Enemy Reinforce-for 1918 is the extent to which the enemy can transfer troops from ments iron; the the Eastern to the Western and Italian theatres. The Committee Easter&quot; Front, consider &quot;that the only safe assumption to make is that the Germans will be able to withdraw the whole of the divisions suitable for offensive operations, entrusting the defence of their Eastern frontier to Landwehr and Landsturm formations. In a memoran-dum dated the 8th October, 1917, prepared for the purposes of giving the War Cabinet his views as to the role of the British forces in the event of Russia being unable to maintain an active part in the war (G.T.-2243) Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig estimated that only thirty-two of the ninety-one German divisions then on the Russian, Danubian, and Balkan fronts were fit to take part in severe fighting on the Western front. General Sir G. Macdonogh, the Director of Military Intelligence, estimates the number of German divisions now on the Eastern front which are suitable for active warfare at thirty-eight [forty-one] (M.P.C-8).

He adds, however, that the remaining divisions, though unsuit-able for active fighting on the Western front, could be used to supply individual men as drafts for replacing casualties in the Western front divisions; in fact, this process ;has been in operation for several months past, seasoned soldiers having been transferred from regiments on the Eastern front to divisions on the Western front, their places being taken by the youngest class of recruits, who, in turn, are made into seasoned soldiers on the Eastern front. General Macdonogh estimates that a total of no less than 900,000 men, of whom no less than 700,000 [824,000] are combatants, might be withdrawn from the German army on the Eastern front, comprising thirty-eight [forty-one] complete divisions, all heavy artillery and machine gun units (other than regimental com-panies), and a large proportion of the flying units, and of the field artillery and trench mortars of the remaining forty-one [thirty-eight] divisions, besides 2,000 infantry from each of the last-named divisions (M.P.C.-8). It may be observed that the thirty-eight [forty-one] complete divisions and the artillery, machine guns, and flying units, constitute a reinforcement (appearing in Table (C)), whereas the men to be withdrawn from the non-transferable units constitute a reserve (appearing in Table (D)). [German divisions might be transferred from Italy to France.. If the whole were transferred this would mean a transfer of eight divisions comprising seventy-four battalions and a combatant, strength of 126,000.]8. It should be mentioned that there are already nineteen German Landwehr and Landsturm divisions on the Western front, which, though not likely to be used for offensive operations, a,re employed only on defensive fronts, and mainly in the Vosges. Up to the present there have been no British troops in France in any way corresponding to these units which are composed of men similar to our B-l men, but, as the result of this inquiry, a number of men in this category are being sent to France. The Director of Military Intelligence considers the German Landwehr and Land-sturm divisions quite as good as the Belgian or Portuguese, and there are understood still to be a few French territorial divisions of similar quality employed in the line.Austrian Rein- 9. Notwithstanding Count Czernin&apos;s recent declaration, theforcements. Committee think it improbable that any considerable reinforce-ment of Austrian troops will be made available for the Western front. They regard it as improbable that Austria will risk the further embitterment of her relations with Great Britain, France, and especially the United States of America, or the acceleration of the exhaustion of her limited reserves involved in such operations. Nevertheless, this contingency should not be ruled out as altogether impossible. The General Staff estimate that a total of fourteen Austro-Hungarian divisions (two of which would first have to be reorganised), con-taining a majority of Germans or Magyars, might be transferred to the Western front. These divisions would represent a force of 121,500 rifles and 266,000 ration strength. If all the remaining Austro-Hungarian heavy artillery (20,500 men), and March battalions (61,500 men) were transferred, a force representing in round numbers a ration strength of some 350,000 Austro-Hungarian, of whom 260,0(J0 are combatants, would have to be reckoned with on the Western front. This would leave some 565,000 Austro-Hungarians to hold the Russo-Roumanian front. If the 350,000 Austro-Hungarians are added to the 900,000 Germans, we reach a total of 1,250,000 men, of whom 960,000 [1,084,000] are combatants which might conceivably be trans-ferred from the Eastern to the Western front. Another con-tingency that must be taken into consideration is that these Austro-Hungarian forces may be transferred to the Italian front. It is to be noted that there are at present fifteen Austro-Hungarian divisions on the Italian front, of which 50 per cent, or more are composed of German and Magyar elements, and which [1280] 8J C
might be replaced by Slav or Rouman divisions from the Russian front and so transferred to France. The strength of these fifteen divisions may be taken at 225 battalions, 167,000 rifles, 250,000 combatants, and 360,000 ration strength. If these forces are added to the previous figures, the total force which might be added to the enemy strength on the Western front would amount to 1,610,000 ration strength, of whom 1,210,000 [1,334,000] are combatants. [Although the transfer of Austro-Hungarian troops to the Western front is not impossible, it seems doubtful whether anything but heavy artillery would actually be sent there. ] .10. Apart from any Italian or additional British divisions The American which might be made available for the Western front, the only ^j/^fj&apos; force which the Allies can count on partially to compensate the a,i 1 &apos; &apos; &apos;&apos; -above increase to the strength of the enemy on the Western and Italian fronts is the American army. At present two [four] divisions are [practically] complete and two more are forming, which are to be ready by the end of December. [Of these one is actually taking over a front, a second will be interpolated into French divisions for training early in February, and will be ready to take over- a sector in April. All four should be ready to hold a defensive front by May.] The General Staff are unable to give the future strength of the American army. General Bliss stated that he hoped to have twelve divisions (ten of which would be fighting troops and two replacement divisions) in France by May, and another twelve (ten fighting and two replacement divisions) bv December, each division having 13,000 rifles and a ration strength of 27,152.The Americans intend to send drafts to France as follows : (1.) After five fighting and one replacement divisions have been transported 4,800 per month. (2.) After ten n^htmsr and two replacement divisions have been transported -9,500 per month. (3.) After fifteen fierhtine and three replacement divisions have been transported 14,000 per month. (4.) Affer twentv fighting and four  replacement divisions have been transported 18.300 ner month. In each case 60 per cent, will be infantry and 40 per cent, other arms, including lines of communication troops.    The above is merely a scheme, now proposed by tne American Staff, but it is dependent upon shipping.Unless more shipping is provided the General Staff regard these estimates as, if anything, on the optimistic side (M.P.C.-6). The &quot; bottle neck&quot; appears to be the difficulty of getting the Americans across the Channel from England. The capacity of the available French harbours limits the numbers of big ships that can be employed to land the men in France, thus necessitat-ing the American troops being landed in England and transported across the English Channel. The First Lord of the Admiralty, who explained that the provision of naval escorts is a limiting factor scarcely less important than shipping in cross-channel transport, undertook to examine the question. The Committee arranged that the Cabinet Committee on the Restriction of Imports should re-assemble to examine the possibility of increas-ing the tonnage available for the conveyance of American troops.11. It is impossible to state the effect of the above-changes in the composition of-the enemy and Allied forces in tabular form with any degree of accuracy, owing to the large number of uncertain factors involved. One of these factors is the uncer-tainty as to how far the various belligerents can replace wastage in the event of heavy fighting such as is anticipated during the present winter on the Western front. Another factor of uncer-tainty is how  far  the  re-organisation   of British  divisions

recommended in this Report will affect the man-power of the -British Expeditionary -force. A third factor is the uncertainty as to how rapidly the suggested German and Austro-Hungarian reinforcements could be brought to the Western front. General Macdonogh states that about twelve divisions a month can be transported from the Eastern to the Western front, but that continuous movement at this rate for a prolonged period would place a great strain on the German railway system and interfere very seriously with the ordinary distribution of supplies, particu-larly in winter. The same applies to the transport of enemy divisions from the Italian to the Western front, although this takes a shorter time. The fourth element of uncertainty is the rate at which the American divisions will become available. The following very approximate table has been drawn up on the unlikely assumption that the whole of the German and Austro-Hungarian divisions have been brought to the Western front by May 1918, by which date the American divisions have been raised to twelve (ten fighting and two replacement divisions). The British and French forces are assumed to be at the same strength as at present (Table (A)), that is to say, it is assumed that drafts are supplied in sufficient numbers to replace wastage but not to make good existing deficiencies.Table (C).*	Divisions.

From the above table it will be seen that, on the assump-tion that the enemy can bring the maximum reinforcement of German and Austro-Hungarian troops from the Russian and Italian to the Western front before the American army has reached a greater strength than twelve divisions (ten fighting and two replacement), and on the assumption that the British and French forces are maintained at their existing strength, the Allies on the Western front will possess a superiority of 346,000 combatants and of 321,000 in ration strength. This superiority might be increased if Italian divisions could be brought to reinforce the Western front, but if this were done the enemy might transport further troops from the Italian to. the French front. If all the transferable German divisions were1 brought from the Eastern to the Western front, but no Austro-Hungarian divisions, the Allies on the Western front, provided their losses are made good, would possess a superiority of 856,000 combatants and 1,031,000 ration strength..
13. To provide an exact comparison of reserves, which term Reserves. is used here to denote men for the replacement of casualties and not formed units* available as reinforcements, is very difficult, owing to the difference of system in the various countries. The following tables, however, give the comparison as nearly as possible: Table (D).-Comparison of Reserves in 1918 for Countries Fightingon the Western Front.British (including-Dominions) .. ..    764.000, of whom approximately 150,000are category &quot; B &quot; men.f French      ...        .. .. ..   390,0004Belgian     .. .. .. ..

The above figures indicate distinct superiority in reserves in favour of the Allies on the Western and Italian fronts, taken together, so far as the year 1918 is concerned. If shipping could by any means be made available the American reserves could, of course, be very much larger. In fact, shipping is for all practical purposes the only limiting factor to their size. It should be noted that the 1920 class is included in the German, Austrian, and Italian, but not in the British or French figures, and that the Austrian age limit is raised as high as 55. The inclusion of the British and French 1920 classes would add about 320,000 men (120,000 British and 200,000 French) to the Allied total. These considerations point to the conclusion that the enemy reserves are more exhausted than those of the Allies. .15. Regarded from a purely statistical point of view the figures quoted above, if they give no cause for anxiety.that the enemy, owing to the Russian collapse, will be able to bring such forces to the West as to overwhelm us by sheer weight of numbers, afford no ground for the expectation that, during the next twelve months the Allies can have any decisive numerical superiority over the enemy. The General Staff, however, point out that, quite apart from the mere accuracy of the figures, which they are unable to guarantee, figures in themselves do not afford a true index of fighting capacity. This depends upon many conditions, some of which vary from, time to time, and ail of which vary as between different armies, e.g., the system and quality of command, organisation, maintenance, communications, stability, and solidarity, of public opinion and Governments. For instance, the General Staff point out that&apos; it would be folly to count the Portuguese as the equal of the Germans. They also point, as an indication of the fallacy of figures, to a comparison between the enormous man-power of Russia, and the part she has played in the war in 1917, and to recent events in Italy.16. The conditions to which the General Staff allude are extremely difficult to weigh as between the enemy and the Allies. By the possession of a unified system of command, and an interior position, with good railway communications, the enemy possesses an undoubted advantage over the Allies. In stability and soli-darity of public opinion, howevejr, itt is doubtful whether the enemy possesses the advantage. War weariness in Austria is probably as great as it is in Italy or France, and in Germany it is probably greater than in England. In Turkey it is very great. On the other hand, public opinion carries less weight in the enemy countries than in the more democratic Allied countries. The Allies have, at any rate, the inestimable advantage of the recent accession of the United States of America, a nation which, though still inexperienced in modern warfare, is of great tenacity and of immeasurable strength, which should prove a material and moral support of the greatest value.   The facts alluded to in paragraph
14 regarding the higher age limit for German and Austrian troops, and the fact that the Germans have put men of 18 years of age in the trenches on the Russian front, compared with a British age limit of 18 and a French age limit of 20, and American age limits between 21 and 32 years of age, should not be overlooked in con-sidering this aspect of the man-power problem,17. A particularly, dangerous factor in the situation is the probability that the enemy will be able to bring large numbers of guns from the Eastern to the Western and Italian fronts, which may result in his possessing a preponderance in artillery.The figures as regards Ally and enemy artillery on the Western, Italian, and Eastern fronts are given in the following table: Table (F).	Field Guns and	Heavy Guns and	Howitzers.	Howitzers.Allies 		Western Front      ..	8.988	6,187Italian Front	3,314	1,325Total	12,302	7,512Enemy 		Western Front	7.352	5,412Italian Front	3 066	1,609*Eastern Front	5,803	2,243Total    ..	16,221	9,264* In addition the enemy has captured about 2,500 guns, 25 per cent, of which are estimated by the Italians to be ready for immediate use.It will be seen that, on the assumption that the Eastern front is entirely denuded of guns, the enemy will have on the Western and Italian fronts a superiority of 3,919 field guns and 1,752 heavy guns. On the other hand, the exhaustion of the enemy&apos;s man-power, the effects of malnutrition, and difficulties as regards raw materials should prevent him from materially increasing his supplies of ammunition.18. On the whole, particularly, when the failure of the Allies to break through on the Western front in 1917 (when they possessed a marked numerical superiority) is taken into con-sideration, the above factors do not appear to the Committee to modify the general conclusion to be drawn from the man-power figures, that the Allies ought to be able to hold their own on the Western front until the period when the increase of American strength begins to alter the balance of advantage in their favour.19. Before leaving the question of Allied man-power as a whole two means can be suggested by which our Allies could assist us. One concerns Italy and the other the United States of America.20. In view of the very substantial assistance which has been given to Italy, not only in the form of military reinforcements, but in the form of shipping, coal, food, raw material, and munitions of war, it is only fair that Italy should make some return. This she might do in the following two ways: (a.) By supplying labour battalions or other organised formsof labour to our army in France. (b.) By forming a strategical reserve which can be moved tothe Western front in case of a great enemy concen-tration there.The Committee recommend that representations should be made to the Italian Government to carry out both these proposals.
21. Our man-power difficulties would to n, very large extent, be solved if the United States of America could agree to put one battalion in each brigade or one company in each battalion of the British Expeditionary Eorce in France. Representations to this effect were made by the Prime Minister to Colonel House in Paris just before the latter&apos;s departure for the United States of America, and a telegram was sent in the course of this enquiry from the Prime Minister to Colonel House explaining the gravity of the present, military situation, and emphasising the importance of American co-operation in the manner proposed. A telegram has recently been received which indicates that the question has been left to the decision of General Pershing.Part III. MAN-POWER FOR THE ARMED FORCES.22. The Minister of National Service (G.-174) states that the total demand for the maintenance of the armed forces during the year 19.18 notified to him is as follows : The Navy&apos;s requirements, including an allowancefor R.N.A.S.   ...        ...         ...         ... 90,000Category &quot;A&quot; recruits for the Army (before 30thJune, 1918)     ...         ...         ...         .;. 600,000Lads of 18 for the Home Defence Force         ... 240,000Lower category men (Army and Air Force)   ... 320,000. Total   ...   1,250,000This demand will now be examined.The Naval Demand.23. In July 1917 the War Cabinet asked the First Lord of the Admiralty to consider the preparation of a return which would enable them to scrutinise the allocation of naval personnel in the same manner as they are able to do in the case of army personnel (War Cabinet 191, Minute 7).    The First Lord states, however, that the new returns for which he has arranged will not be available until early in the new year.    He has informed the Committee that the whole question of the man-power of the navy has been very fully considered by the strongest committee he could appoint, and he  holds out verv little hope of any reduction in the requirements  as  set  forth  above  (M.P.C.-3)     In the absence  of   full  returns   it   is  useless   for  the   Committee to pursue this branch of their investigation.     The Committee . learn from the First Lord that a suggestion that the American Navv should be invited to man some portion of our small craft, has been examined, but cannot be adopted as the United States Navy has no naval personnel to spare, and is hard put to it to find the necessary crews for its own naval and transport services.The Military Demand, 24. The estimate of 600,000 Category &quot;A&quot; men required during the next twelve months is explained in a Memorandum by the Adjutant-General (M.P.C.-4) in the following terms: [A few words of further explanation, which were elicited in. the course of the enquiry, have been added in brackets.^CATEGORY &quot;A&quot; MEN.I.

Deficit.The estimates of liabilities and assets within the Army indi-eate that approximately 600,000 (the exact number is 615,000) Category &quot; A &quot; men who will attain the age of nineteen years before the 1st November, 1918, must be provided from sources outside the Army between the 1st November, 1917, and the 31st October, 1918, if our armies overseas are to be maintained at their present establishments.Of this 600,000 required to be found from civil life 250,000 over eighteen years eight months are immediately required, and should have been posted in November in order that they might have been trained in time to meet the requirements in France up to 1st April. (The numbers of Category &quot; A &quot; recruits over eighteen years and eight months actually provided by Minister of National Service in November were 8,279.)The provision of this 600,000 is required to be distributed as follows: To be provided immediately in order that deficiencies in Expeditionary Forces which will exist on the 1st April, 1918, may be made good by that date      ... ... ...To be provided monthly from December 1917 to June 1918 (both inclusive) in order to main-tain fighting units up to establishment, 50,000, namely, seven months at 50,000250,000 350,000Total600,000

The French estimate is for 2,250,000.29. The Adjutant-General considered that little or no altera-tion in his estimate could be made, if the assumption were adopted that in 1918 we should be fighting on the defensive instead of on the offensive as in 1917. This view was supported by General Macdonogh, who maintained that casualties were* Explained in detail in Part IV.[1280] &quot; EIf the present rate of supply of Category &quot; A &quot; recruits over eighteen years and eight months of age is not increased it will be necessary to reduce the Expeditionary Forces by some fifteen divisions by the 1st April, 1918.The above figures are reproduced in Annex II in the form of a balance sheet (M.P.C.-12).25. As has already been stated,: ,the Director of National Service hopes that, without any legislative change, but with free-dom from Government pledges to Trade Unions and with drastic economy on the part of all Government Departments and civilian demands, another 100,000* &quot;A&quot; men, over and above the 450,000 (449,000 as stated by the Adjutant-General) already in the Army, may become available. This would reduce the deficit for military purposes to 500,000.26. The situation, however, is in reality even more unsatis-factory than this figure would seem to indicate. This is due to the fact that the 450,000 Category &quot;A &quot; men, who can be made available from the forces at home for drafting overseas, have to provide drafts for all arms, large numbers of them being already ^ . trained and allocated to arms other than the infantry, where the largest casualties occur.27. In their examination of how the deficit is to be removed the Committee considered two methods concerning the army itself, viz.: (a.) The possibility of reducing wastage. (&amp;.) The possibility of rendering a large proportion of the army available for first line service.Before examining the possibility of further exploitation of civilian sources of man-power it will be convenient to give the results of the Committee&apos;s inquiries into the two above aspects of the problem.Wastage. 28. The Adjutant-General informed the Committee that theestimates of wastage for 1918 in paragraph 24 were based on our experience in 1917. The British casualties in killed, wounded, and missing, but not including sick from the 1st January to the 30th November, 1917, are shown in the following table, the esti-mated German casualties opposite the British front, and in all theatres, being given for purposes of comparison:-Table (G).
certainly not less on the defensive side than on the offensive. He instanced our offensives on the Somme, at Arras, and, more recently, in the Ypres salient, and expressed the view that in each of these cases the German casualties were undoubtedly higher than our own. Our casualties, he said, showed a progressive decrease during the offensives this year, whereas our casualties during the German offensive from Cambrai, while we Were on the defensive, had been very heavy, amounting to no less than 33,000 men. In support of this opinion he pointed out that the estimated German casualties during 1917 opposite the British front are consider-ably higher than the realised British casualties as given in Table (G), notwithstanding that the Germans were generally on the defensive and the British generally on the offensive. The Com-mittee, however, were not disposed to attach much importance to conclusions based on estimates of enemy casualties. A tendency has been observed in every war for belligerents to exaggerate enemy casualties, and such estimates are generally admitted to contain an element of optimistic conjecture. The present war is nO exception.30. The Committee felt that the experience of the French army, which for some time has been face to face with a difficult man-power situation, would be of special value. They therefore asked the French President of the Council and Minister of War to allow a representative of the French General Staff to advise them on the question. M. Clemenceau was good enough to accede to this request, and the Committee were fur-nished with a memorandum from French General Headquarters, dated the 16th December, 1917 (M.P.C.-24), and two representa-tives of French General Headquarters, Colonel Duffieux and Major Serot, attended the Committee on the 18th December to give such further explanations as were required. The French army are basing their calculations for 1918 on their experience of 1917, that is to say, on the supposition that the total loss will be 75,000 a month, one-quarter of whom will return within three months, and half within twelve months. The net wastage of killed, missing, wounded, and sick is from 35,000 to 40,000 a month; that is to say, about 450,000 men a year in addition to the returned sick and wounded are required to replace casualties. Colonel Duffieux considered that a strategy of continuous hammer-ing, such as was adopted by the Germans at Verdun in 1916, and on the Somme in 1916, though more costly than a policy of limited objectives, inflicts greater casualties on the enemy. In fact, he regarded it as impossible to wear down the enemy with-out sustaining heavy casualties ourselves. The following table contains a comparison of British and French estimates of wastage :-Table (II).British and French Estimates of Wastage on Western andItalian Fronts.	Estimate of net wastage.	Combatant strength.	Percentage of net wastage to com-batanrs.British   (including&quot;	7ih%200	1,288,000	55i dominions)			French	450,000	1.890,000*	24 to 25** The figure for combatant strength communicated from French General Headquarters after Colonel Duffieux&apos;s return was 1,838,534, but in view of the approximation of this figure to t\v combatmt strength as worked out by the Director of Military Intelligence (Table (A) ) the latter iigure was taken for reasons of uniformity. The difference in the figures only makes a fractional difference in the percentage! Since then a thbd calculation has been received through the French Military Attache, which gives the lighting strength as 1,778,900 men. This figure would give a percentage of 2&quot;- per cent, instead of 24 per cent, for net wastage to combatant strength.
It will be observed that the Army Council&apos;s estimate of net wastage for the British and Dominion forces is more than double that of the corresponding French estimate when compared in percentages of wastage to combatant strength. The comparison it is true, is not quite a scientific one, since the figures for net wastage include an allowance for sick, and some part of the wastage from this cause falls on non-combatants. Nevertheless, it is a better basis of comparison than that of net wastage to ration strength, since it is very difficult to get an accurate basis for com-parison between British and French ration strengths owing to the difference of conditions, one army being overseas and the other in its own country. It should be noted that both estimates are based on the experience of the past year, and it must be borne in mind that, whereas the British army fought on the offensive almost continuously throughout the year, the French army since the spring offensive has deliberately adopted a policy of conservation, and has been enabled to carry out this policy owing to the vigour of the British attack. Moreover from the Vosges to Belfort the French occupy a considerable stretch of line where very little fighting takes place, and where their casualties must be very small. In 1918, if the British do not take the offensive, and the enemy does, it would seem probable that the French mav not be able to keep their wastage to the same level. On the other hand, it must not be overlooked that the French estimates are drawn up on the assumption that after August 1917. the policy of the Allies will become more vigorous. On a general review of the considerations referred to above the Committee consider that the War Cabinet will be justified in allowing for a rate of wastage below that provided for in the Army Council&apos;s original estimates.31. In addition to the casualties arising from deaths, wounds, . and capture, there is a constant wastage in the army from sick-ness. There is little doubt that the wastage from sickness has a direct relation to the character of the operations, and is.increased by the exhaustion resulting from prolonged and arduous operations such as those recently engaged in on the Western front.32. It has now been definitely decided by the War Cabinet that the policy of the Allies on the Western front shall be defensive, at any rate during the early part of 1918. The general policy is stated in the following extract from a joint Note pre-pared by the Supreme War Council, dated the 13th December, 1917:-&apos;&quot; 1, A definite and co-ordinated system of defence from the North Sea to the Adriatic must be adopted by the Allies.   This will include : &quot;(a.) The reconsideration of existing lines of defence, and the construction of further and successive defensive lines to cheek an advance by the enemy:&quot; (b.) The use to the utmost of all possible mechanical means in order: &quot;(i.) To provide the maximum mobile reserve ;&quot; (ii.) To afford rest and opportunities of training for reserves.&quot; (c.) The greatest possible development of rail and sea communications between the different sections of the front, and the preparations to be made for the movement of troops between these different sections, especially in respect of the Italian front, and of the measures to be taken in case of a German attack &quot;ihroucrh. Switzerland.&quot; The defensive policy thus advocated need not preclude such minor forms of active defence as any Commander-in-Chief may think necessary for i -;-taining the offensive spirit of his troops.&quot; Furthermore, the policy of a strong defensive not only does not pre but actually prepares for any offensive measures in any theatre of war ybe decided upon for 1918, when the present political situation in Iiussi      d the military situation in Italy are more clearly defined.&quot;
33. The above policy has been approved by&apos;the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 302, Minute 7). From a statement by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, it is clear that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig is making his preparations for the future on a similar basis (War Cabinet 302, Minute 1), and the Memorandum furnished from French General Headquarters leaves no room for doubt that General Petain&apos;s plans, while admitting of attacks with limited objectives, are in the main defensive (M.P.C.-24).34. Having regard to the character of the general policy to be adopted by the Allies on the Western front, and to the French estimates as set forth above, the Committee consider it justifiable and necessary to base the demand for men for the army on a lower basis of calculation than the casualties for 1917.   They consider that it should be impressed on the Higher Command in the British Expeditionary Force that the policy of the Allies is to conserve their strength until such time as the increase in American  strength,  or  the decrease of the enemy&apos;s strength, enables them to take the offensive with reasonable prospects of success.  The strategy and tactics of the Higher Command should be adapted to this policy, and every effort should be made to reduce casualties by suitable strategical and tactical dispositions, by the utmost development or fortification, and by such other means as those  responsible  may be  able  to  devise.    The  Committee recommend  that the  Chief of  the Imperial   General Staff should direct the Field-Marshal  Commanding in  France to submit his plans in execution of this policy at an early date, and that a copy should be sent to the British Military Adviser to the Supreme War Council.35. One direction in which the army can gain a few men is Cavalry, by cutting down the cavalry. The Committee are not satisfied that full value is obtained from this arm. They note that on the Western front there is a total of 5 British, 6 French, and 2 Belgian cavalry divisions, a total of 13, compared with 2 German cavalry divisions. On the Italian front there is a total of 4 Italian cavalry divisions (including 3 re-forming) compared with no enemy cavalry divisions, making an aggregate on the two fronte of 17 Allied compared with 2 enemy cavalry divisions. In view of the great strain which the maintenance of horses makes on tonnage, and in view of the small part which cavalry has plaved in the major operations of the present war on the Western front, the Committee are strongly of opinion that the cavalry in all Allied nations should be cut down.    They recommend : (a.) That on the Western front the British cavalry should be very greatly cut down, and that the personnel should be released for services in other arms for which they are suited, and more particularly for Tanks and the Uoyal Flving Corps.(b.) That the Allies should be pressed to take similar action in regard to their cavalrv.36. Conferences  have  been  taking   place    between   the Home Defence. Admiralty and the General Staff, and the War Cabinet have sanctioned a rearrangement of the  forces allocated to Home Defence, which will release some men for service abroad.37. Before leaving the subject of man-power for the armed Fatigue in the forces, reference must be made to evidence which has reached Army. the Committee of considerable fatigue and even discontent in the
ranks of the British army. It is true that on his recent visit to France the Chief of the Imperial General Staff received good accounts of the troops, and that the reports of the census of letters do not indicate a bad state of moral. Recent reports from the Field-Marshal Commanding, however, indicate considerable fatigue among the troops, and especially in the artillery, who have been engaged almost without intermission the whole summer, and the reports of the Minister of National Service leave no doubt that soldiers returning from the front to civil life, particularly men who have been two or three times wounded, are in a thoroughly disgruntled state. The causes to which the alleged dissatisfaction of the troops is ascribed are the following : (a.) Dissatisfaction with what they believe to have been unnecessary waste of life during the continued hammerings against the Passchendaele Eidge this autumn:(5.) Dissatisfaction with the number of men still at home, who have escaped military service. This is an old grievance, but has been accentuated by recent increases in wages :(c.) The fact that large numbers of men who have been wounded two or three times have had to return to the front:(d.) Discontent, particularly among men who have been sick or wounded, at being incorporated in new battalions instead of returning to their previous units where they have formed ties and associations. This has applied especially heavily on English troops who have been used to fill up Irish battalions, but it is also much resented among Scottish troops where the clan tradition applies in some regiments.38. The Committee feel that it is of the utmost importance that as much relief and rest as possible should be given to the troops during the present winter. The only source from which it appears possible to obtain such relief is -the Home Defence Army. They have therefore authorised the Army Council to send to France as many Category &quot; B&quot; men as can be spared from the Home Defence forces.39. The Committee have also agreed that it is necessary to desist from the practice of sending to the fighting front men who have been severely wounded two or three times, and an announce-ment in this sense was made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 20th December, 1917.40. One more recommendation which the Committee make of Divisions. in regard to the organisation of the British Expeditionary Force is that the number of battalions in a division should be reduced from twelve to nine. This course was adopted by the French army when they were faced with a somewhat similar problem to that which now confronts us; that is to say, when they were faced on the one hand with a shortage of men, and on the other hand with the need for an increase in the number of divisions in order to enable them to pfrovide ia sufficient &quot; roulement &quot; of divisions during the German attacks on Verdun. It is under-stood that the French military authorities consider that this re-organisation has proved a great success. One effect has been to increase the proportion of artillery to infantry, and the Committee were informed by the French officers who attended to give them the French experience that during some of the brilliant French attacks in 1917 the proportion of artillery to infantry was in the ratio of three to two.    The system has also been adoptedL12S0] &apos; F
Part IV. THE CIVILIAN SOURCES OF MAN-POWER.41. Having considered above the steps which the. Army can take to improve its man-power situation, the next step is to explore our remaining civilian resources in man-power. To assist them in this part of their enquiry the Committee were furnished by the Minister of National Service with a number of reports dealing with the subject in considerable detail (G.-174, G.-174a, G.T.-2850, and G.-181). Sir Auckland Geddes and a member of his staff also -attended to furnish the Committee with all the explanations they required.42. In dealing with this branch of the subject, the Committee had to keep in view two principles which must ever be before the Minister of National Service : (i.) To secure the largest possible number of men for the Army.The importance of this is emphasised by the fact that there are no less than 3,500,000 men of military age in civil life, of whom 950,000 belong to Category &quot;A.&quot;t(ii.) To ensure that essential trades and industries are main-tained to the extent necessary for the proper conduct of the war.The importance of this principle is brought out by the present civilian demand for labour for approved programmes, which is as follows : Immediate demand ... ... ...      100,000(No less than 16,861, of whom 16,715 are men, are required for the Govern-rnent approved priority list of con-struction.)Prospective demand ... ... ...       400,000500,000(of whom 100,000 are women).It should be noted that the great bulk of 91,000 vacant jobs, requiring men to fill them, is for Government work direct or indirect.with success in the German army. Having regard to recent developments of mechanical warfare, some of the general reasons for the adoption of a similar system in the British army appear to the Committee even stronger now than they were at the time of its adoption by the French and German armies. The total strength of the British army has been greatly increased by the development of such mechanical devices as heavy artillery, machine-guns,, tanks, trench mortars, and poison gas. In the aggregate these services have absorbed a very considerable personnel, and it appears only reasonable that these great develop-ments of our offensive and defensive power should be accompanied by some reduction in the infantry on whom the greatest casualties fall. The Committee recognise the difficulties in applying this policy to the British army, owing to the shortage of trained staff officers, and they do not underrate the objection that the whole of the war establishments and load tables will have to be revised, unless the United States of America agree to replace the reduced British battalions. Nevertheless, they consider that the advantages, particularly if additional divisions can be formed as a mobile strategical reserve at the disposal of the Field-Marshal Commanding in Chief, outweigh the disadvantages.
43. Sir Auckland Geddes explained to the Committee the general lines on which he is proceeding. With a view to military require-ments, he is constantly scrutinising the lists of employed men in order to comb out those who can be spared for military service. At the same time he is making use of a variety of measures for limiting non-essential trades and diverting the labour into war occupations. The work involves a gigantic shuffle of the industrial man-power of the country. Its magnitude may be estimated by the fact that there are between 600,000 and 700,000 male persons of all ages and categories to be dealt with in this way. Among the methods employed may be mentioned the stimulation and fostering of drifts of the population from one industry to another. For example, where coal-mines are not working full time,&apos;as on the East Coast, a drift would perhaps be caused by working short time in mines in the neighbourhood of ports, while keeping the. more distant mines working at full pressure. Another method is to introduce wTar industries into a district where the war has caused normal occupations to work short time. For example, an attempt is being made to establish an aeroplane industry in Lancashire, where the cotton factories are working short time.44. The Committee, with the assistance of the Minister of National Service, carefully examined the labour requirements for the priority, immediate, and prospective constructional programmes. As the views of the Director of National Service were supported in all cases, it is unnecessary to this Report to give his various explanations in detail. On a few points of the programme alone is it necessary to make any comment.45. Most important of these latter is the programme for ship construction. On* this point the Committee were given some interesting figures, which are reproduced in the following table:  Table (I).Number of Persons	New construction.			Repairs.	Totals.Engaged on 	Hulls.

Warships Merchant Auxiliary (Naval) (War Office)..	55,19a 72.504 -  17,397 0,504	37,193 37,176 14,701 2,466	92,386 109,680 32,098 8,970	27.586 5*,897 14,007 5,455	119,972 168.577 46,105 14,425	151,598	91,536	243,134	105,945	349,079In addition to the above figures there are 66,000 employed in Royal dockyards on repairs, including a crtain amount on small construction. The proportion of construction to repairs cannot be asceitained.46. It will be noticed that the total number of persons actually engaged on merchant ship construction is only 72,500. Of necessity, labour employed on constructional work and repair wor  is occasionally diverted from one class of work to the other, but the average number permanently engaged on hulls is not in excess of the figures given. In addition, some 37,000 are engaged on the construction of marine engines.47. In view of the relatively small numbers engaged on this vital industry, the Committee have no hesitation in recommending
that the immediate demand for 20,000 men for shipbuilding (of which only 6,000 vacancies have yet been notified) as well as the prospective total demand of 80,000 men (of whom 12,500 are skilled), should be furnished by the Minister of National Service, and the War Office the moment the former is satisfied that sufficient material will be available to keep fully occupied the numbers applied for. The Committee were informed that the impending completion of the Trade Card index for the forces serving at home should greatly facilitate this process. It was stated that there is reason to believe that a certain number of skilled shipbuilders are at present enrolled in the Royal Defence Corps guarding bridges and munition works, which, in the opinion of the Committee, if correct, is a serious mis-application of energy. The Diiector of National Service, however, has the matter in hand.48. The detailed examination by the Committee demonstrated the fact that many of the other demands for labour are a direct result of the shipping situation. In this category might be included, besides the Admiralty demand, the-Office of Works requirement for labour to build food storage, and the demands of the Timber Con-troller and the Board of Agriculture. Apart from this, the need for more ships to convey American troops to France, which is a direct assistance to our own military man-power, has already been enrpha-sised. The need for increased shipbuilding has been accentuated by the comparative breakdown of the American shipbuilding programme, in regard to which news has recently been received that the output for 1918 is likely to be nearer 2,000,000 tons than the 6,000,000 originally hoped for. This makes it imperative that ship-building and its connected industries should have a first claim on our man-powrer.49. Before leaving this&apos; question of shipping, it is pertinent to mention one labour-saving device which has been adopted by the Controller of the Admiralty and his advisers for increasing the construction of shipping, namely, the formation of national ship-yards. The advantage of this scheme is that it is proposed to utilise prisoners of war (6,000) and military labour, which could not possibly be employed side by side with ordinary labour in the private yards. The scheme is not altogether free from the risk of causing labour disputes, but it is hoped to avoid these, since the yards, being devoted simply to fitting ships together and not to expert mechanical processes, will require a minimum of skilled labour. While recognising the importance of not bringing the national yards into operation until the private yards are working to their full capacity, the Committee trust that, subject to this essential condition, one or two of the yards will be opened as an experiment as soon as possible.50. The Minister of Munitions recently suggested to the War Munitions Cabinet, as a very rough and provisional estimate, that to meet a Owl-Mines, and great military emergency it might be possible to comb out as Railwiiy-S-many as 120,000 category &quot; A &quot; men from munition works.    (War   -Cabinet 293, Minute 17.) The Minister of National Service informed the War Cabinet that the maximum number which -Qould be combed out without reducing the output of munitions was approximately 60,000 men.   The number for which he was allowing was 62,000. One of the questions which arose in this enquiry was as to whether it might not be advisable, in order to procure more men, to make a reduction in the output of munitions.   On the whole the Committee came to the conclusion that this was not desirable.   Already the original munitions programme has bad to be curtailed for shipping reasons.   As it is desirable as far as possible to supplement our failing man-power by increased mechanical power, it would be inexpedient to make further reductions in the output of munitions.
The Committee, however, rely on the Ministry of Munitions to co-operate with the Minister of National Service in setting free as many men as can be spared.51. The Committee discussed the question of the release of further coal-miners with Mr. Calthrop, the Coal Controller, and of further railwaymen with Sir Herbert Walker, the Chairman of the Railway Executive Committee. Both these gentlemen gave reasons for regarding the estimates of the Minister of National Service as optimistic so far as concerns their own field of activity. On the whole, however, the Committee decided not to amend these estimates, and they count on the utmost assistance from the Coal Controller and the Railway Executive Committee in this matter.52. The Committee&apos;s enquiries into the civilian demand for man-power support the following estimates by the Director of National Service as to the number of men of all ages that can be secured for naval and military service from civil life : Table (J).

If, however, he is to accomplish these results, or perhaps greater ones, he stipulates for a small amount of legislation and for certain assistance from the War Cabinet, and from the various Government Departments.LEGISLATION. 53. The legislation asked for by the Minister of National Service is in respect to (a) the period of grace automatically added to exemption, (h) the power to cancel occupational exemption, and (c) registration.Abolition of the 54. The Minister of National Service asks that the Cabinet shouldperiod of Grace, approve the introduction in the House of Commons as early as possible in January 1918 of a Bill to amend the Military Service Acts with a view to an acceleration of the flow of recruits by abolishing the automatic exemption for a period of two months of men engaged in a certified occupation under the Munitions of War Act, 1915, on withdrawal of the certificate of exemption. The Bill will also take [1280] G
power to abolish the similar fortnights exemption given to men who have held Tribunal exemptions, and also to cancel all exemptions granted by Tribunals on purely occupational grounds to men engaged in occupations not declared to be of essential national importance. The effect of this Bill, except perhaps in regard to the last of the above-stated objects, will not increase the net total of men available as recruits for the Army, but it will materially accelerate the arrival of the new recruits at the training centres, thus enabling the Army to secure a larger quota in the first half of 1918 before substantial American assistance can be expected. In view of the heavy enemy attacks expected on the Western front in the first half of 1918 this is a matter of great importance. The Committee recommend the introduction of the above legislation at the earliest possible date, subject to negotiations with Trades Unions in regard to release from pledges (paragraph 60).55, The Committee discussed with the Minister of Munitions, The Power tothe Minister of Labour, the Admiralty Controller, and the Minister tCanff 1VCl&apos;ul&apos;:&apos; - ,T   .     , 0     .      .  &apos; . J   ,    ,      . . , , tional Exemptof National Service the question as to whether it would be advisableto adopt the policy of the &quot; clean cut&quot; ; that is to say, to call to the Colours all fit men within certain age limits whatever their occupa-tion. The Minister of Munitions and his advisers were strongly in favour of this course. They pointed out that, when asking the Trades Unions to release the Government from their pledges, it would be a great advantage to be in a position to invite their co-operation in a simple schema of this nature. They pointed out that it would be far easier to apply than any system .of calling up men within certain age limits from certain occupations only. They explained the great difficulty and friction which would arise in applying this latter policy to occupations which were on the border-line between an exempted and non-exempted trade. For example, in an engine shop it&quot; might be necessary to call up one man who was engaged on making a land engine and to exempt his comrade who was engaged on making a marine engine, which must inevitably lead to friction and difficulty. On the other hand, the Minister of National Service pointed out that the adoption of a policy of the &quot; clean cut &quot; would immediately result in the calling-up of 12,000 men from ship-building and 10,000 men from agriculture. The Admiralty Controller was of opinion that the loss of 12,000 men from the shipyards would have a disastrous effect upon the shipbuilding programme; he admitted that in course of time substitutes might be trained, but he pointed out that there was no time to spare if the shipbuilding programme was to be carried out. The Committee themselves were satisfied that it would be equally disastrous to call up such large numbers from agriculture. In these circumstances, they decided that the draft legislation should be framed on the policy of taking men by age blocks&apos;according to occupation. They trust that all Departments will co-operate with the Minister of National Service to their utmost extent in the application of this policy.&quot;&quot;56. A draft Bill has been prepared by the  Ministry of Registration. National Service in concert with the Local Government Board which embodies the following new provisions in the principal Act :-&apos;*&apos;(L) A requirement that boys who have reached, or hereafter reach, the age of 15 years since the 15th August, 1915, shall be registered.* The Ministry of National Service ad\l the following footnote to paragraphs 56 and 57: &quot;The only provisions in the above list which could be effected by Defence of the Realm Regulations are those marked (*). Parliamentary Counsel doubts whether (1) and (2) in paragraph 55 can be so effected, and thinks it necessary to consult the Law Officers on the point. We have no authoritative opinion as to paragraph 56 (4) and paragraph 57, but presumably the precedent of Defence of the Realm Regula- &apos; tions 41a and 53a applies, Whether as a regulation-or as a clause in a Bill, paragraph 57 is likely to be opposed rather heavily.&quot;
*(2.) A provision for the compulsory registration of men who have re-entered civil life after serving in His Majesty&apos;s forces, since the passing of the National Registration Act, 1915.(3.) A provision that men must notify to the authorities any change in the occupation in which they were engaged when originally registered. A provision requiring the production of a registration certificate as a condition of any civil employment, the employer to be guilty of an offence if he does not insist on the production of a certificate.*57. In addition to these provisions the Ministry of National Service considers it absolutely necessary that all holders of registration certificates should be legally obliged to carry them, and to produce them on demand to the police or other proper authority. Without this provision it is feared that it would be impossible to enforce any effective system of registration, and the existing requirements under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 53 a, that certificates must be produced on demand at a man&apos;s house, has proved in practice to be inadequate.58. It will also be necessary to reduce the period of twenty-eight days within which a man may notify a permanent change of address, and likewise the period within which a man entering the country is bound to register. It has been found in practice that so long a delay makes the tracing of removals difficult and cumbersome, and that it gives an undesirable opening to those who wish to postpone or evade military service. The twenty-eight days&apos; grace should be reduced to seven/59. The Committee, while approving the principle of legislation in regard to registration, decided to leave the details to be worked out in the first instance between the Minister of National Service and the President of the Local Government Board.GO. The introduction of the legislation referred to in paragraphs 53-55 is dependent upon the Government obtaining release from the Trades Unions from the pledges which were given to them earlier in the war. It is true that on 26th April, 1916, when a representative of the Trades Unions asked what guarantee they had, if they came to an agreement, that the Government will keep it. Mr. Henderson replied as follows : &quot; There is no guarantee at all, and you cannot get any guarantee at all in view of the changing circumstances of a great war like this. What we will do if we are compelled by the necessities of the war (which must always be paramount)again to depart from the schedule.....is we will ask youto come and meet us before we do it.&quot;- - &apos; &apos; ....Although this statement should prove valuable in negotiating with the Trades Unions, it would not in good faith provide a justi-fication for denouncing the agreements without consultation. A list of the pledges is given in Annex IV. They were entered into under conditions entirely different from those which now obtain, when the employment of men in their factories was considered more important than their withdrawal to the army. The vital military necessities of the nation urgently call for some relaxation. Mr. Barnes informed the Committee that he had already made some preliminary approaches on the subject to some of the Trades Unions, whose response, if not cordial, was at least not unsatisfactory. The action agreed on by the Committee was that the Prime Minister should* See note on page 20..
first make a general statement in Parliament (which he did on 20th December), after which the Minister of National Service should meet the Trades Unions and explain the proposals of the Government.(il. In addition to the legislation referred to above and the -Administrative release from pledges, the Minister of National Service has asked for Changes, the following administrative changes : (i.) Construction Programmes and Labour Supply. That all Government Departments engaged on construction or production work of any kind should be directed by the War Cabinet, before adopting or submitting to the Cabinet or War Priorities Committee any programmes of construction, to place themselves in communication with the Director of National Service and work them out in terms of labour.(ii.) Scrutiny of Programmes. That the War Priorities Committee either directly or through its Sub-Committees should overhaul existing programmes of construction with a special view to labour requirements, (iii.) Reduction of Non-essential Industries. That, in order to stimulate the drift of labour from one trade to another, to which allusion has already been made, the Minister of National Service should be instructed by the War Cabinet, in concert with the Home Office and Board of- Trade, to work out a scheme for reducing non-essential manufacture, except under licence.(iv.) Building Licences. That the control of the licensing of building operations should be transferred from the Ministry of Munitions to the Ministry of National Service, who would act under the general direction of the War Priorities Committee. The Minister of Munitions has agreed to this proposal.(v.) Building Contracts. That a better system for the allocation of building and similar contracts should be adopted by Government Departments. It is alleged that it has been the practice of Government Departments to place their contracts among a very limited number of contractors, some of whom frequently adopt methods which upset the labour conditions in particular districts. With this object in view the Government Departments interested in the placing of contracts-for constructional work should be directed to consider favourably the proposals of the Minister of National Service for the placing of contracts with federations or groups of smaller builders, or with a single smaller builder acting as agent, and personally responsible for a group or federation.(vi) Adaptation of Existing Factories.  That the War Cabinet should call the attention of the Government Departments concerned to the great importance of adapting existing factories rather than building new ones. It was alleged that there is a tendency to build new factories where existing buildings are available, and examples were given. General Smuts informed the Committee that a special Sub-Committee of the War Priorities Committee is studying this question.(vii.) Dilution. That the Sub-Committee of the War Priorities Committee, which is dealing with dilution, should proceed with the utmost despatch, and that on receipt of its recommendations the Minister of National Service, in concert with the Minister of Munitions, Admiralty, and the Minister of Labour, should undertake the necessary negotiations with the Trades Unions without
delay. The War Cabinet has already directed (War Cabinet 287, Minnte 2) that a small expert staff drawn from the existing staffs of the Admiralty and Ministry of Munitions should be attached to the Ministry of National Service, and that duplicates of all dilution reports should be supplied to the Ministry of National Service. The transfer of an adequate staff and the supply of such reports should be given effect to immediately.(viii.) Foreign and Colonial Labour. That all Government Departments should be instructed by the War Cabinet to examine the possibility of employing more foreign labour, and should take the necessary action for securing it through the Ministry of Labour and Ministry of National Service. In this connection the First Commissioner of Works has suggested that labour could be obtained from Holland, Switzerland, Denmark, Scandinavia, and possibly Spain (G.T.-2962). A proposal to increase the number of factories and ports manned exclusively by American labour was felt by the Committee to require further investigation in view of the difference in wages in the two countries.(ix.) Discharged Soldiers. That the War Office and the Minister of National Service should co-operate as closely as possible in regard to the employment of discharged soldiers. In this connection the Committee were informed that 187,000 men had been discharged within the last twelve months, and that they were now being discharged at the rate of 20,000 to 30,000 a month, (x.) Low Category Men. That every endeavour should be made by the War Office to release low category men from Military Service, since the more men that can be so released the greater prospects of securing higher category men for the army.(xi.) Prisoners of War. That the allocation of prisoners of war to industry should be transferred from the War Office to the Minister of National Service.(xii.) If the above proposals are approved it will be necessary to ensure the fullest possible co-operation of all Govern-ment Departments in carrying out the policy laid down by the War Cabinet, which will have to be put into execution by the Minister of National Service. Govern-ment Departments should endeavour to comply with the rulings and directions of the Minister of National Service, but -should they find it necessary to raise any objection to a ruling or direction given by him they will be able to appeal to the War Cabinet. It is hoped that such appeals will only be necessary very rarely, and that it may be possible for Departments to arrange any differences that may arise after consultation with the Minister of National Service.The Committee recommend the adoption of all the above proposals.Ireland. 62. The Committee have carefully considered the expediencyof applying compulsory service to Ireland. Apart from the addition of 150,000 to 160,000 recruits, there is much to be said for this proposal. Ireland stands to win as much from this war as any part of the British Empire. There is no question that at the end of the war Ireland will demand, and will probably leceive, all the- benefits that Great Britain receives from the reconstruction arrangements. In these circumstances it is only fair that there should be equality of sacrifice. At present there is no such equality. Not only does Ireland not contribute a quota of troops in any way commensurate with that of Great Britain, but there is little [1280] H
doubt that the hardships of the war and the restrictions imposed on the population in order to maintain our forces at full strength apply with far less rigour to the Irish population. It is unfair to ask the British people to make greater sacrifices when the Irish escape altogether, and there is no doubt that this aspect of the question will be hotly pressed when the proposals of the Committee come before Parliament.63. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the utmost difficulty would be encountered in enacting the legislation for the application of compulsory service to Ireland. The Irish would probably rally to them not only the pacifists, but others whose pacifism is at present veiled. It is understood that the Trades Unions would not desire to force compulsory service on Ireland. The effects of violent scenes on the floor of the House of Commons would not only reduce the prestige of this country in Europe, but might react in a highly detrimental manner in the United States of America and in the Dominions. Moreover, all prospect of a successful issue to the Irish Convention would be removed.64. Even if it were decided to run these risks and to force a Bill applying compulsory service to Ireland through Parliament, it is more than doubtful if the military results would be satisfactory. Many good judges consider that conscientious objection would develop in Ireland on a very large scale. It would not be possible to refuse in Ireland the licence which has been granted to con-scientious objectors in Great Britain, and it is probable that the whole of the energies of the Sinn Fein movement would be given to the support and development of conscientious objection. It should be noted also that the system of Tribunals in operation in Great Britain could not be adopted with any prospect of success in Ireland ; in fact, compulsory service can only be applied in Ireland as part of a scheme for the &quot; clean cut &quot; that is to say, the compulsory recruit-ment of all men of certain ages, although it might be applied only to certain occupations.65. In view of the great political difficulties and dangers involved, and th - meagre results to be anticipated, the Committee cannot at present recommend the adoption of a policy of applying compulsory service to Ireland.66. The attention of the Committee was called to the fact that Englishmen large numbers of Englishmen have taken refuge in Ireland from the sheltering from application of compulsory service. The Minister of National Service    IrelandefV&apos;-informed them that he had already been in communication with Scotland Yard and the Irish Government with a view to the recall of these individuals, and a certain number of recruits had been obtained.   The Committee felt, however, that the matter should be pursued with greater vigour, and they commend this recommenda-tion to the attention of the Minister of National Service, the Home Office, and the Irish Office.67. The Committee also have rejected suggestions that the age Extension of Age for military service in this country should be lowered, or that it Limits-should be raised The lowering of the age is not favoured by the Army Council. The raising of the age from 41 to 45 would only render 50,000 additional men available for military service, and an extension to 50 would only add another 60,000. There would be very strong opposition, and the Committee do not feel justified in recommending this proposal. They consider that these measures should be regarded as a last resort, only to be adopted either to avert a great national catastrophe, or to enable us to exploit a success to the full.
68. The Committee believe that all the possible sources of civilian man-power have now been explored and the results given above.Part V. THE EFFECT OF THE COMMITTEES PROPOSALS ON MILITARY MAN-POWER.69. The Committee have endeavoured to ascertain the effect of the various recommendations made above on our military man-power at different stages of the year 19 L8. With this object in view, they placed the experts of the Ministry of National Service in communi--cation with those of the Adjutant-GeneraFs Department in order, if possible, to arrive at an agreed basis. Unfortunately, mainly owing to differences of opinion as to the basis on which the casualties should be reckoned, agreement has not been obtained, in spite of a number of conferences between the two departments, presided over by General Smuts on behalf of the Man-Power Committee. In this Report, therefore, the results of the calculations of both Departments will be given.70. The following tables are based on the assumption that the divisions in France are reduced from twelve battalions to nine battalions apiece in accordance with orders which have been issued &quot;by the Army Council: Table (K).(Nine months of hard fighting, that is to say, from February 15 to November 15, and three months&apos; light fighting.)At-	Estimate of the Minister of National Service.*	Estimate of the Adjutaut-GenerahfMarch     31,1918   ..

Of the above results, the only really comparable figures are those as at the 31st December, 1918. Throughout the year the estimates of the Minister of National Service and the Adjutant-General are arrived at on different bases.71. In his calculations the Minister of National Service has spread evenly over the twelve months the total number of drafts which he estimates will be required during 1918 for theatres of war other than France.
On the other hand, the Adjutant-General in his calculation has ear-marked out of the pool of men at his disposal at the beginning of 1918 the whole of the drafts for other theatres which he estimates will be required during 1918, for the reason that in the other theatres of war it is only possible to employ men of over 20 years of age.One result of the Adjutant-GeneraFs method of distribution is that in the event of a great emergency in France in tlie earlier months of 1918 he would still have in hand to meet such emergency a large unexpended proportion of the men intended for threatres other than France, although such balance would not be shown by his estimates above referred to.This is a factor of no small importance in the present stage of: the war. The enemy might seek a decision in the Western or Italian theatres in the first half of 1918 in order to achieve a peace satisfactory to himself before the increase in American assistance renders this impossible.The absorption on the Western front of these men who have been ear-marked for overseas might later on lead to a shortage in the more distant theatres of war, and such a contingency would involve a reconsideration of the position of these theatres, and might possibly even compel a relaxation of our efforts; but, regrettable though this would be, it would be preferable to a collapse on the Western front.72. The deficit on the 31st December, 1918, as estimated by the Adjutant-General exceeds the deficit estimated by the Minister of National&apos;Service by 67,039 in Table (K) and by 88,409 in Table (L).These differences are mainly due to the difference between the bases of calculation of the number of drafts reqxiired in 1918 for theatres of war other than France.The Minister of National Service estimates this figure at 120,000, arrived at on the following basis agreed to by General Smuts, namely : The total casualties (killed,  died, wounded,  missing, andprisoners) during 1917 in theatres of war other thanFrance amounted to 48,()00. To allow a margin of safety, 25 per cent, was added to thisfigure, making 60,000 in all.   This latter figure was doubledin order to include sickness casualties. The final estimate, therefore, is 120,000.The Adjutant-GeneraFs estimate is 192,000, which figure is based on the plans of the GeneralStaff for 1918, and was the figure originally accepted by the Minister of National Service in his memorandum dated the 15th November, 1917.73. A second but less important difference between the two bases of calculation arises out of the estimate of the number of sick and wounded men returning to the front. The difference on this account, in Table (K) for the whole year, is that the Minister of National Service estimates the number of returned Expeditionary Force men becoming fit again during 1918 at a figure for the yeac about 30,000 higher than the number estimated by the Adjutant-General.74. The above explains the main causes of discrepancy between the estimate of the Minister of iSational Service and the estimate of the Adjutant-General.75. There is, however, a further very important difference between the two estimates, which is not readily apparent from a comparison of the final results.
Part VI. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND REOOM-MENDATIONS.77. Before setting out in detail the conclusions and recom-mendations of the Committee it will be convenient to summarise the broader considerations of policy on which they are based. The Committee do not underrate the seriousness of the military situation. As shown in Part II of this Report, the military collapse of Russia sets free very large enemy forces on the Eastern front for service elsewhere. No conjecture can as yet be formed as to where these forces will be applied. The enemy may decide to use part of them to exploit the resources of Russia, or he may apply them in the Balkans, or in Italy, or he may seek a decision on the Western front. All that can be&apos; said with certainty is that the enemy in 1918 will be so strong on the Western and Italian fronts as to preclude any reasonable probability of a decision on those fronts in favour of the Allies. The military advisers of the Allied Governments have recommended a defensive policy on the Western front, at any rate for the first half of 1918. In these circumstances it is evident that the staying power of the Allies must be safeguarded until such time as the increase in the American forces restores the balance of superiority decisively in their favour. The safeguarding of staying power involves not only the maintenance of the armies, but of the nations, and in both respects our Allies are becoming increasingly dependent upon ourselves. This country has to bear the principal burden of maintaining the sea-power of the Allies ; for dealing with the enemy&apos;s submarines; for shipbuilding; for transport of food and supplies of all kinds for the peoples, armies, and munition factories ; for the supply of coal and many kinds of ordnance and munitions ; and in a great degree for the financial support of all our Allies. Even the transport of American troops depends ultimately to a considerable extent on maintenance of our shipping. In these circumstances no comparison can be drawn between this country and Allied countries in regard to the proportion of the population avail-able for military purposes. If so large a number of men were diverted from industry or production to military service as to impair [1280] &quot; IThe Minister of National Service includes in his estimated liabilities at the end of 1918, a training reserve of 105,000, whilst the Adjutant-General makes no such provision in his estimate.It seems only reasonable, however, to assume that the Army Council will desire to have in hand at the end of 1918 a training reserve of such a number of men as will be sufficient, together with returned Expeditionary Force men, to furnish the drafts required for overseas during the first few months of 191.9, and if the Adjutant-General&apos;s basis is accepted, his estimated deficit at the end of 1918 should be increased by such figure as, in the opinion of the War Cabinet, it will be necessary to hold in hand in respect of the training reserve above referred to.76. On the other hand, on a 9-battalion basis and budgetting for nine months&apos; heavy fighting, the Adjutant-General estimates the gross casualies in France during 1918 at 896,000, which is 90,000 greater than the corresponding estimate (800,000) of the Minister of National Service.The Minister of National Service, however, arrives at a slightly lower figure for casualties in 1918 than that submitted by the Adjutant-General. Both estimates are calculated from the same figure of casualties for 1917, the difference in result being due to different divisions having been made between infantrv and other arms in making the calculation.
our power of maintaining our Allies during the coming year the war might be lost, and already our powers in this respect are severely taxed.78. Having carefully considered and balanced the requirements of the fighting forces and of the nation and of the Allies as set forth in this Report, the Committee make the following recom-mendations : (1.) The following principles should be adopted in the dis- ^&quot;Id^AhJ&apos;0 tribution of our man-power, whatever the number of men available [)j8t^ii)Ulion ^may be :  Man-Tower.(a.) The fighting personnel requirements of the Royal Navy and of the Air Services should have absolute priori over all other services.(b.) After the fighting personnel requirements of the Royal Navy and Air Services, shipbuilding should have priority over all other demands, and, after shipbuilding, the construction of aeroplanes and tanks.(c.) Food production, timber felling, and the provision of food storage accommodation, since their object is to set free shipping, must be regarded in the same category as shipbuilding.(d.) The priority accorded to shipbuilding, food production, and timber felling is subject to the general supervision of the Minister of National Service for the prevention of the waste of labour.(2.) Every effort should be made to induce General Pershing, Reconimenda-to whom the question has been remitted by the President of the ^urVllies &quot;S United States, to permit the incorporation of &quot;American battalions in British brigades or companies in British battalions.   (Paragraph 21.)(3.) The War Cabinet Committee on the Restriction of Imports should report on any steps which can be taken to expedite the transport of American troops to France.   (Paragraph 10.)(4.) The Prime Minister should press the Italian Government at the next meeting of the Supreme War Council to supply labour battalions or other forms of organised labour for service in rear of the British Expeditionary Force in France, and for the formation of a mobile strategical reserve which can be transported in case of neceesity to the Western front.   (Paragraph 20.)(5.) The Prime Minister, at the next meeting of the Supreme War Council, should press the French and Italian Governments to reduce the number of cavalry divisions with a view to a saving in transport.   (Paragraph 35.)(6.) The general military policy of the British Expeditionary Recommenda-Force on the Western front should be based on the principles pro- tions affecting posed by the Permanent Military Advisers of the Supreme War the Armv-Council in their note dated the loth December, 1917, that is to say, on the assumption that the general policy is to be one of a general defensive and conservation of strength.   Every effort should be made to avoid wastage of man-power by the adoption of suitable strategy and tactics, and by the development of fortifications.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should direct the Field-Marshal Commanding the British Expeditionary Force to submit his plans on this basis at an early date, and a copy of these plans should be sent to the British Military Adviser to the Supreme War Cabinet. (Paragraph 34.)   The adoption of this policy should justify a . lower estimate of wastage than that allowed for by the Army Council.   (Paragraph 30)(7.) With a view to the creation of additional divisions for a mobile army of manoeuvre in France, the number of battalions in the British divisions on the Western front should be cut down from 12 to 9.   (Paragraph 40.)
Becommenda-tions for Legislation.Recommenda-tions affecting&apos; Administration.(14.) All Government Departments engaged on construction or production work of any kind should be directed by the War Cabinet, before adopting or submitting to the War Cabinet or War Priorities Committee any programmes of construction, to place themselves in communication with the Minister of National Service and work their schemes out in terms of labour.   (Paragraph 61 (i).)(15.) The War Priorities Committee, either directly or through its Sub-Committees, should overhaul existing programmes of con-struction with a special view to labour reforms. (Paragraph 61 (ii).)(16.) The Minister of National Service, in concert with the Home Office and Board of Trade, should work out a scheme for reducing non-essential manufacture except under licence. (Para-graph 61 (iii).)(17.) The control of the licensing of building operations should be transferred from the Ministry of Munitions to the Ministry of National Service, who would act under the general direction of the War Priorities Committee.   (Paragraph 61 (iv).)(18.) With a view to a better system for the allocation of building and similar contracts and to the avoidance of upsetting labour conditions in particular districts, Government Departments interested in placing contracts for constructional work should consider favourably the proposals of the Minister of National Service for placing of contracts with federations or groups of smaller builders, or with a single smaller builder acting as agent and personally responsible for a group or federation. (Para-graph 61 (v).)(19.) Government Departments, when deciding on the construc-tion of new factories, should exercise the greatest care to make use of existing factories when available rather than to build new ones. (Paragraph 61 (vi).)(20.) The Sub-Committee, of the War Priorities Committee, which is dealing with dilution, should proceed with the utmost despatch, and on the receipt of its recommendations the Minister of National Service, in concert with the Minister of Munitions Admiralty, and Minister of Labour, should undertake the necessary negotiations with the Trades Unions without delay. The decision of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 287, Minute 2) directing the(8.) The British cavalry on the Western front should be greatly reduced in order to set free personnel for other services. (Para-graph 35.)(9.) In order to give rest and relief to the men who have been fighting continuously on the Western front, the Army Council should send as many Category &quot; B&apos;&apos; men as possible from the Home Defence forces to the Western front.   (Paragraph 38.)(10.) With a view to reinforcement on the Western front, the forces devoted to Home Defence should be reduced to the extent which the Admiralty and War Office, with the approval of the War Cabinet, consider practicable.   (Paragraph 36 )(11.) Men who have been more than once severely wounded should not be sent back to the fighting line.   (Paragraph 39.)(12.) The Army should obtain from the Home Defence forces the balance of its own requirements in men below Category &quot; A.&quot;(13.) Legislation should be introduced in Parliament at the earliest possible date on the following subjects: (a.) The period of grace automatically added to exemption. (Paragraph 54 )(6.) The power to cancel occupational exemption, the draft legislation being framed on the basis of a policy of taking men by age blocks according to occupations. (Paragraph 55.)(c.) Registration. The principle approved, but details to be worked out between the Ministry of National Service and the Local Government Board.   (Paragraphs 56-59.)
attachment to the Ministry of National Service of a small expert-staff drawn from the existing staffs of the Admiralty and Ministry of Munitions, and that duplicates of all dilution reports should be supplied to the Ministry of National Service and be given effect to immediately.   (Paragraph 61 (viij.)(21.) AH Government Departments should be instructed by the War Cabinet to examine the possibility of employing more foreign labour, and should take the necessary action for securing it through the Ministry of Labour and Ministry of National Service. (Para-graph 61 (viii).)(22.) The War Office and the Minister of National Service should co-operate as closely as possible in regard to the employment of discharged soldiers.   (Paragraph 61 (ix).)(23.) Every endeavour should be made by the War Office to release low category men from military service.   (Paragraph 61 (x).)(24.) The allocation of prisoners of war to industry should be transferred from the War Office to the Ministry of National Service. (Paragraph 61 (xi).)(25.) The fullest possible co-operation should be given by all Government Departments to the Minister of National Service in carrying out the above policy. Government Departments should endeavour to comply with the rulings and directions of the Ministry of National Service, subject to the right of appeal to the War Cabinet. Such appeals, however, should rarely be necessary. (Paragraph 61 (xii).)(26.) Compulsory military service should not at present be Ireland applied to Ireland.   (Paragraphs 62-65.)(27.) The Minister of National Service, in consultation with the Home Secretary and the Secretary for Ireland, should endeavour to secure immediately for military service those Englishmen who have taken refuge in Ireland, and should concert such measures as may be possible for preventing men liable to military service from seeking refuge in that country.   (Paragraph 66.)(28.) The age limits for military service should not be extended for the present.   (Paragraph 67.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., March 1, 1918.
