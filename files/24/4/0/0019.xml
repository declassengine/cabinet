[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.)Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.SECRET.-  . 7G.-169.WAR CABINET.REORGANISATION OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction. (Previous Paper, No. G.-163.)THE memorandum of the President of the Board of Trade (G.-163) raises in an indirect form the important question of the function of the Government in the future with regard to the development and encouragement of industry, and I would therefore suggest that the War Cabinet, in assenting to the general scheme of reorganisation put forward by Sir Albert Stanley, should do so without prejudice to the ultimate allocation of the work and responsibility amongst Government Departments, with respect to which I hope at a later date to submit proposals.The ultimate solvency and prosperity of the country depend, I believe, very greatly upon the success of our efforts to increase home production, and, as is indicated in paragraphs (3) and (6) of the Committee&apos;s report, this will certainly involve Government Departments taking a more active interest in assisting in promoting the prosperity of our industries than has been the case hithertOiI think that we mustjook forward, if possible, to the establishment of what I may provisionally describe as a Ministry of Industry and Commerce with important transport, manufacturing, trade, and other departments such as may conceivably grow out of section (a) of the proposed subdivision of the Board of Trade. It may be that some of the individual departments may assume such a degree of importance in our national life as would warrant their being presided over by what we should at present describe as a Minister.I hope, therefore, that the approval of the proposals, including paragraph 4 (a) of the Presidents Memorandum, will not be taken as in any way prejudicing the duty at present devolving upon me of instituting enquiries and making proposals with respect to industrial reconstruction. In general, I take it the division between my own functions and those of an executive department would be that when a policy has been decided upon it would, after consultation with those concerned and when approved by the War Cabinet, devolve upon an executive department to make arrangements for giving effect to it. The position in the Government organisation, for example, of the Department of Mines should not be prejudiced by the adoption of these proposals. It is at the moment being carefully examined, and obviously affects the interests of many other departments, and the same certain qualifications would apply to the adoption of any national or imperial system of intelligence and research. We should at the same time not prejudice an ultimate decision respecting the future of the Ministry of Munitions in any modified form.With respect to the proposed Advisory Council, I take it that it will be a general rule that it should be sufficiently representative both of producers and consumers, and secure so far as may be possible the co-operation of labour, whether by means of the industrial councils established under the Whitley scheme or otherwise.By his recommendation of the Committee&apos;^ report, I take it that the President contemplates that no single council would be sufficiently representative, but that there would have to be a goodly number of special trade committees. [1134]
I may perhaps be allowed to say that I heartily welcome the general character of the Presidents proposals, and I have put up this memorandum mainly to secure that what is now sanctioned shall not be taken to prejudice the wider national consideration of reconstruction which it will be necessary to consider at a later date.^ (Signed)        C. ADDISON.Ministry of Reconstruction, November 1, 1917.
