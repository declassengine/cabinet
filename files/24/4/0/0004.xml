ON the 31st July the War Cabinet appointed a Committee to consider the whole problem of a 11 increase in the pay of soldiers and , sailors, and to report. The Committee are: Sir Edward Carson, M.P. (Chairman). Mr. Stanley Baldwin, M.P. (Treasury). Mr. H. W: Forster, M.P. (War Office). Brigadier-General Childs (War Office). Dr. Macnamara, M..P. (Admiralty). Mr. G. H. Roberts, M.P. (Board&quot;of Trade).Mr. Thomas Jones (Secretary).2. The Committee have held seven meetings,&apos; and have consulted Admiralty and War Office officials familiar with the subject-matter of the enquiry.3. The present Interim Report is limited to recommendations for the war period only, and for dealing with the ranks below those of commissioned officers. The approval of the Admiralty and Army Council to the recommendations has been obtained.With regard to the Army, the Committee confine their recommendations to soldiers serving in British units and do not ^include the numerous formations of coloured soldiers, labourers, &amp;c.The Committee recommend that as little delay as possible should occur in giving effect to their recommendations simultaneously for the Navy and the Army.The question as it affects commissioned officers will be considered in a further report.4. In comparing the pay of sailors and soldiers with the wages of civilian workers, the distinction between the two classes should be emphasised. The whole cost of living in the case of the civilian has to be defrayed out of his wages. The sailor and soldier has nothing to pay for rent, board, or lodging ; and further, the soldier is clothed entirely, and the sailor to a certain extent, at the cost of the State. Men of both services, moreover, have the prospect of a life pension. In case of permanent disablement in the service of the State all sailors and soldiers receive a pension for life on a not ungenerous scale, and in case of death attributable to service, provision is made for widows and children substantially beyond what is made for civilian wage-earners by the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.5. The separation allowances now paid by the State to the wives or other dependants of service men have an important bearing on the subject of our enquiry. These separation allowances, which in the case of the Navy have been instituted since the beginning of the war, are now on a much more generorrs scale, both as regards sailors and soldiers, than in 1914. The increases made in the allowances for children are shown in the following table : Navy.

This allotment, however, ceased to be required from the soldier after 9.11.14, from which date it was paid as Separation Allowance, making- the Separation Allow-ance rates as under : 2	6		6	2	6	2	05	0	3	6	2	0	2	07	0	5	0	3	6	3	05	o	3	6	2	0	2	0In both services the allowance for motherless children, which was fixed at 3s. per week for each child at the beginning of the war, was subsequently increased to 5s. (without allotment), and now stands at 7s. for the motherless child living in a family by itself; and where two or more of the same family live together, at 7s. for the first child and 6s. for the second and for each other child.6. These considerations, which form a substantial factor in the pay of the fighting forces, are dealt with in the following question and answer in the House of Commons on the 9th August.Mr, Herbert Samuel asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is now the average remuneration of an infantry private without dependants, and of an infantry private with a wife and two children, under the heads of pay, clothing, board, lodging, &amp;c, separation allowance paid by the State, if any, and grant from the Civil Liabilities Committee, and what is the total remuneration in each case.Mr. Macpherson.: The weekly value of the State&apos;s expenditure on the infantry private corresponding to the wage payable in civil life is approximately as.follows : 	Without Dependants.	With Wife and Two Children.Pay., a Clothing Board and lodging&apos;     ..          .. Separation allowance If in receipt of a grant from the Civil Liabilities Committee, add	7s. to 105. U. 3s. 20s.

(plus the allot-ment of 3s. 6d. shown above).Totals   ..	30s. to 73s. Qd.	47s. 6d. to 94s. 6d.It should, however, be observed, that the estimated value of disability and service pensions, which was left out of account in this statement in Parliament, ought not to be ignored in estimating the real remuneration of sailors and soldiers.7. The aim of the Committee is, in the first place, to secure a minimum pay of Is. per day to every British soldier, free of all charges, save the insurance contribution of \\d. per week (for which he secures the right to full insurance benefit on return to civil life and to receive maternity benefit on his wifes account while still serving), and save also penal deductions (fines) and hospital stoppages in case of illness for which the man is himself responsible.To secure this provision is the purpose of the Committee&apos;s first recommendation for the Army, by which the sjoldier is relieved of his allotment up to the extent of 6d. a day for privates and corporals, and lOd. a day for sergeants and higher ranks. To this is added the proposal that proficiency pay at the rate of od. or 6d. per day should be payable after six months&apos; service, instead of after two years&apos; service, as at present, and that there should further be an increase in the soldiers&apos; pay of Id. per day for each full year of service since the outbreak of war, thus providing a progressive increase in pay according to length of service.   We also recommend that time-expired
men. should have the option of drawing pension in addition to their pay, with retro-spective effect during the war.The recommendation as to; proficiency pay will confer special benefit on the fighting troops and bring their pay more into line with that of the technical and departmental corps.8. Subject to the exception mentioned in the last paragraph, the Committee recommend the abolition of hospital stoppages, which, although much smaller in amount than formerly, being now estimated at not more than 150,0001. per annum for the Army, give rise to much&quot; irritation and misrepresentation.9. ft should be noted that the Is. per day thus to be secured free of deduction to the private soldier does not represent the total benefit he is intended to receive. After six months he may receive 3d. or 6d a day, and after each completed year of service an additional Id. per day. Therefore, even though a man remains a private for three years, his pay would be either Is. (id. a day or Is. 9d. a day, according as he secured a second class or first class certificate of proficiency.10. The proposals as regards the Navy are based on a provision for sailors of a sum proportionate to the personnel as compared with the Army. They follow the Army proposals as to assistance by the State in the payment of allotments to dependants, the shortening of the period of service qualifying for additional pay, payment of pensions to men who complete time during the war, and the abolition of hospital stoppages. They differ from the Army proposals as regards increased messing allowance, replace-ment of kit, and the improved pension provision.11. Further, as regards the navy, hitherto men who have completed time for pension but who are detained under the Royal Proclamation have not received their pensions. In consideration of the suspension of pension payment in these cases the men have received 2d. a day detained pay, which has recently been made 2d. a day for each year of detention up to a maximum of Sd. per day during the fourth year of detention. It is recommended that pensions to these men should be paid foithwith, and, of course, similarly to all men who may during, the war be detained for service beyond the completion of time for pension; and, further, it is recommended that payment should be retrospective to the 4th August, 1914 ; that is to say, pension, with arrears, should be paid to all men detained under the Royal Proclamation as from the date of their&apos; completion of time for pension. This will cost, for the year ending 31st July, 1918 :-(a.) Pension charge   .. .. .. .. .. .&apos;. 240,000(h.) Arrears .. .. .. .. .. .. 160,000400,000- But it is considered equitable to abate from the arrears and to discontinue the payment in future of detained pay. This means an abatement from the 400,000Z. of (say) 80,0001, which will mean, as far as can be estimated, a net charge for the year ending the 31st July, 1918, of 320,000Z. (As the figure is somewhat speculative, the estimate given in the recommendations against this item is 350,000L) It should be observed, however, that in the second year of this concession, inasmuch as there will be no arrears to pay, the total charge of the concession will be somewhere in the region of 250,0001. It should be noted, therefore, that this concession will cost, in the second year, something like 100,0001. less than in the first year.The basis of the seamen&apos;s pension is an allowance of lOcL a day for life after 22 years&apos; service, with additions for badges, character, and medals. This was the rate payable when the period of continuous service was 2/) years, and no addition was made when the qualifying period was increased from 20 to 22 years. It is now proposed to make the basis lid. A small concession is also proposed for marines in respect of acting and lance time. Concurrently it becomes necessary to abolish the arbitrary maximum now imposed, viz., Is. 2d. for seamen and Is. 3d. for marines, and allow each man to receive the pension actually earned by him per scale.12. The messing allowance in the Royal Navy, which is granted to supplement the standard ration issued in kind, happens at the moment to be the same as the messing allowance for the Home Army, namely, h\d.This is a pure coincidence, due to a recent readjustment between the standard ration in kind and the messing allowance, which had no effect on the value of the daily allowance for victualling as a whole.If the proposal to increase the messing allowance in the Navy to Id., as the Committee propose, is met by a similar claim on behalf of the Army, the answer is that in comparing the victualling of the Navy and Army the total allowance both in kind and money must be considered, not merely one part of it, namely, the messing
allowance; that the messing conditions of the two services are entirely dissimilar, the soldier being catered for in large units, while the messing of the sailor under the conditions of his service is split up into small units, each of which arranges its own messing and expends its own allowance.13. It wiirbe seen that the total cost of the recommendations as affecting the Army is from 45,085,0001 the first year to 48,847,0001. the second year figures substantially below the 140 millons put forward by the recent Trade Union repre-sentation on the matter.Summary of Recommendations.14. The following are the recommendations for the Army, with estimates :  1. The State should take over the whole of the compulsory allotment for the wife and Class B dependant and the whole of the existing allotmentfor the Class A dependantup to the 6c/. and lOcl. limit. This concession should apply to all soldiers who belong to units whose depots are. situated in the United Kingdom and who are paid at the rates laid down in the Royal Warrant for the pay, &amp;c, of the Army. It should not apply to men enlisted at special rates of pay, e.g., motor drivers at 6s. a day.   Estimated cost .. .. 26,000,0002. Proficiency pay to be payable after six months&apos; service instead of asnow after two years&apos; service.   Estimated cost.. .. ..    8,500,0003.

Hospital stoppages to be abolished except where a.man is responsiblefor the complaint for which he is being treated.   Estimated cost..   . 150,000 5. Men compulsorily retained in the Army beyond twenty-two years&apos;service to have the option of drawing their pension in addition topay in lieu of the increased pension on final discharge provided bythe present regulations.Estimated cost Fourth year of war (including 275,000L arrears) .. ..       435,000Fifth year of war      .. .. .. .. ..        197,0006, The above decisions should come into operation as from 29th Sept., 1917.The total cost of these proposals is as follows : Fourth vear of war     .. .. .. .. .. 45,085,000Fifth year of war        .. . . .. .. .. 48,847,00015. The following are the recommendations for the Navy : 1. The State to take over a portion of the allotment not exceeding 3s. &amp;d. in the case of allotments amounting to 5s. or more per week, and in the case of smaller allotments to dependants other than wives, such lesser sum as will leave the man chargeable with Is. 6d. per Aveek.   In the case of boys whose pay normally does not admit of an allotment in excess of 2s. a week, the State to take over Is. ofthe allotment                  ..         ..         ..                    .. 2,000,0002. 3d. a day extra to able seamen after three years (at present after sixyears), with corresponding increase in afloat allowance to marines 250,0003. Messing allowance at Id. (at present b\d.)          ..         &quot;...          .. 800,0004. Abolition of hospital stoppages ..          ..          ..          ..          .. 8,0005.

Pensions to be paid to men who have completed time for pension and are detained under Proclamation; the same to be retrospective as from the beginning of the war, minus, in each case, the value ofthe detained pay already received.Cost for fourth year of the war .7         ., .. .. 350,000Cost for fifth year of the war   ..       &apos; .. .. .. 250,0007.

The above decisions should come into operation as from 1st Oct., 1917.16. It will thus be seen that for the war period the cost of these recommendations for both Army and Navy will be: Fourth year of war     ..         ..          ..         ..         - * 50,393,000Fifth year of war       ...      ..         ..         .. 54,055,0002, Wliitehall Gardens, S.W., September 5, 1917.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BT C R.
