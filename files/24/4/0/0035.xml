December 1917.SECRET.G.-184. .0THE POSITION OF THE NORTHERN NEUTRAL COUNTRIES.[Previous Paper, No. G.-153.]THE Coiumittee have considered the Naval Staff Memorandum G.T.-2885 of the 6th December, 1917, on the position of Norway under the conditions that at present prevail, and their bearing on the Admiralty proposal to construct a mine-barrier across the North Sea.The Committee&apos; were impressed with the great importance of using as few destroyers as possible in connection with the patrol of the barrier, in view of the urgent need of their services elsewhere, and recommended that : 1. We should try to secure a base, such as Stavanger, on the Norwegian coast,with the assent of Norway. 2. Provided Sweden remained neutral, it would be to our advantage for Norwayv. to enter the war on our side 3. Norway should be informed that we will render the necessary assistance toprevent:  t(a.) The landing of any considerable German force in Norway ; and (o.) Air raids on any large scale.If the above policy is accepted by the War Cabinet, the Committee recommend that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be requested to take the necessary diplomatic action, and also inform the United States Government, and obtain their concurrence to our proposed action.(Signed)        E. CARSON, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., December 14, 1917.[1265]
