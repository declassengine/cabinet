ffhis Document is the Property of His Britannic 3Hajesty&apos;s fioiragamsaL]Printed for the War Cabinet.  December 1917.SECEET. G.-18Q.THE FOOD SITUATION.Memorandum by the Food Controller.THE problems before the Ministry of Food are three maintenance of supply, distribution, and control of prices. Of these the first named is first also in order of importance: unless an adequate supply of essential foods can be assured it is of little use to consider distribution or prices. The present Memorandum is aceord-ingly concerned mainly with questions of supply, though in the note appended on Mr. Austen Chamberlain&apos;s minute of the 6th December I have dealt also with certain points relating to distribution.On the side of supply the position may be summed up briefly as follows : The food programme for 1918 involves the importation of 13,000,000 tons of essential foodstuffs, This represents a gross reduction of 3,000,000 tons and a net reduction of 2,500,000 tons (assuming that subsidiary foods, even without any priority of tonnage, will, in fact, arrive to some extent). If this programme of imports is realised the essential military and civil requirements can be met, though many subsidiary foods will be lacking.The War Cabinet have accepted the recommendation of Lord Milner&apos;s Com-mittee that tonnage up to the extent of this import programme should be provided. The realisation of the import programme depends, however, not on tonnage alone, -but on two other conditions also namely, the exportable surplus of the countries of origin and finance. As matters now stand, there is the gravest reason to anticipate failure in respect of exportable surplus or finance, or both, even if the full tonnage be provided.The salient facts as to the principal foodstuffs are as follows : Cereals. The critical situation in regard to cereal supplies was fully set out in the Memorandum of the Wheat Executive of the 16th November, which I cireu-lated to the Cabinet on the 22nd November (G.T.-2744). As is there shown, the whole cereal programme is threatened with disaster in two vital points: (a.) The programme assumed an exportable surplus from North America of 7,000,000 tons.  Mr. Hoover now puts this at 3,600,000, i.e., half. .:(b.) In the Argentine, from which we need 2 to 24 million tons of wheat and-1-^-million tons of maize, it has not been possible, owing to want of money, to make the necessary purchases, and unless the present negotiations lor the provision of exchange are immediately successful, there is grave danger that the surplus may be diverted elsewhere.Later information only tends to confirm the pessimistic conclusions of the earlier report. Mr. Hoover, in reply to a cablegram based on this report, reaffirms his view that the exportable surplus cannot be put any higher without restricting consump-tion in America; indeed, at the moment, Mr. Hoover is going further yet, and has asked for 50,000 tons of Canadian wheat to be supplied for the Belgian Relief Commission. The Indian Government has reduced its estimate of wheat exportable from India during January, February, and March by one-third. The demands for Italy and for Greece are being increased.Meats and Fats. The whole policy of Government purchase of meats and fats adopted last August, after insistent pressure by Mr. Hoover, and embodied in. the agreement setting up the Inter-Allied Meats and Fats Executive, has been crippled, and continues to be crippled, -so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, by lack of dollars with which to make purchases. For more than three weeks in JN ovemher the purchases of the Buying Commission in America were stopped abso-lutely for want of money, This affected not only bacon, hams, and lard, but all [1251] &quot; &apos; B
other articles, including meat and butter. At a time of acute and growing scarcity of fate in this country we were compelled, for want of money alone, to refuse an offer of 10,000 tons of lard in America, for which tonnage was available. At the present moment this lard would have been invaluable in meeting the butter shortage.Meantime Mr. Hoover, in repeated cablegrams, is threatening to refuse export of all foodstuffs not purchased by the Commission, and is pressing the Commission to extend its operations.   It simply cannot do so for want of money.In Canada the position is even worse. While the Treasury are unable to provide anything beyond a quite inadequate sum for Government purchase of bacon, &amp;c, they are pressing me to stop all private imports. They are taking the same position on grounds of exchange in respect of linseed and other purchases in the Argentine.This illustrates a point of fundamental importance. A considerable proportion of the dollars available in North America are now used by the Treasury in maintain-ing the exchange. It is this alone that makes private traders able to finance purchases there. In so far, therefore, as dollars are used to maintain the exchange, while at the same time dollars are refused for Government purchase of goods whose private import is prohibited, priority of finance is given to unessential foods and other articles imported by private traders over essential foods required by the Government. The priority of finance which, in accordance with the decision of the Allied Governments, I require for the minimum food imports, must be absolute priority not only over munitions and other Government purchases, but over the maintenance of the exchange for other articles.Broadly, it may be said that in order to realise the food import programme of 13,000,000. tons agreed to by the War Cabinet, we need for articles other than cereals money for foreign purchases to the extent of about 25,000,000L a month, of which more than half is required in North America. Unless this is guaranteed the whole food programme fails. I circulated a Memorandum on finance to the War Cabinet on the 27th November last (G.T.-2778).It should be added that though in respect of meats and fats emphasis has been laid on shortage of finance, it is far from certain that even if finance and tonnage are provided an adequate exportable surplus would be discovered in America to make up for the certain, or almost certain, losses of supplies from Denmark, Holland, and Australasia.Sugar. In respect of this it need only be stated at this stage that the Sugar Commission are extremely uneasy at the apparent tendency of Mr. Hoover&apos;s Inter-national Sugar Committee to secure for America an undue share of the easily acces-sible supplies and to throw this country back upon the Eastern supplies, which, for reasons of tonnage, can probably not, in fact, be obtained.To sum up, a substantial failure in respect of any one of the three conditions limiting foreign supplies of food, namely, exportable surplus, finance, and tonnage, destroys the food programme. So far as can be seen, there is likely to be substantial, if not disastrous, failure in respect not of one but of all three conditions at various points.The first step is for the Government to endeavour to prevent or to mitigate this failure (1.) By securing for food adequate finance corresponding to the tonnage pro-vided, that is to say, an average of 25,000,000/. a month for foreign purchases other than cereals, and by removing the difficulties which hinder purchases of cereals and of other goods alike in Argentina.(2.) By using the strongest possible pressure on the American Government to increase the exportable surplus, primarily of cereals (as suggested in the Wheat Executive Report of the 16th November), and later of other foods.These measures are of first importance, and should be taken without the slightest delay.The second step is to consider what action is possible if, as is most probable, in spite of these efforts, the full programme of food imports cannot be realised. Substantial relief can be sought in three directions only: (a.) Increase of Home Production. The food import programme is based on the assumption that home production in 1918 will be at the same level as in 1917.   If the home production in fact proves less larger imports will
be required. If (as may well be hoped) it proves greater, this will com-pensate for a deficiency of imports. I would urge, therefore, that the demands for labour and machinery made by the Agricultural Depart-ments should be met up to the hilt. These demands, so-far as England and Wales are concerned, have been fully set out in the Memorandum circulated by Mr. Prothero on the 24th November (G.T.-2767). Natur-ally, however, little can be hoped for from increased production till after September; the most critical time will come before. (&amp;.) Introduction of Compulsory Rationing. I am afraid that compulsory rationing is unavoidable, in any case, in order to secure a fair distribu-tion of foodstuffs and to allay the growing unrest caused by suspicion of unfair distribution. Apart from this, however. I am prepared, if com-pulsory rationing be introduced as from April next, to accept a reduc-tion of 1,000,000 tons on the 1918 programme of food imports, representing, a reduction of 1,333,000 tons over a complete year of rationing. This would relieve the pressure under all three heads  tonnage, finance, and exportable surplus and could be carried through without reducing consumption below the assumed physiological require-ments,I should add that in the absence of rationing, and owing to the. shortage of other foods, the , consumption of cereals is showing an alarming increase. From August to November of last year the consump-tion of flour and bread increased about 4 per cent. This may presumably be taken as the normal seasonal increase through the colder weather. In the present year the increase in the same period has been nearly 12 per cent., that is to say, three times as great.I have already circulated a Memorandum to the Cabinet advocating the setting up of machinery for compulsory rationing (November 9-G.-171). A more detailed Memorandum is now being prepared, and I do not ask for a decision this week, but must strongly press for one in the course of next week, (c.) Further Diversion of Cereals from Animal to Human Consumption.  Suggestions have been put before me for an increased extraction of flour from wheat (up to 90 per cent.), for utilising a larger proportion of the oat crop for human consumption (in oatmeal or as a diluent of wheat), and for a further reduction of livestock. These suggestions clearly raise difficult questions requiring detailed examination in consultation with the Agricultural Departments, and I am not yet prepared with definite proposals, but I refer to them as indicating a possible means of relief. The extent of relief is, however, limited by two considerations. First, the diversion of cereals from animal to human consumption ultimately reduces the meat and milk produced, and the gain is thus only partial. Second, prohibitions on the use of grain by farmers for stock are extremely hard to enforce, and become harder the more stringent they are in form.The foregoing, I hope, indicates sufficiently that the problems now facing the Ministry of Food are as difficult and as critical as those before any other Department of the State. In the circumstances, in addition to immediate action, on the larger points indicated above, I feel entitled to claim that every avoidable impediment to my work be removed and every possible assistance of detail be given. I may indicate, in particular, the following points: (1.) Unification of Food Control. The transfer of the Board of Trade organisation for meat and cheese purchases, which I asked for immediately on taking up the appointment of Food Controller (in a memorandum circulated on the 16th July) and which was again brought before the Cabinet in a memorandum dated the 24th October, has not yet been accomplished. The present lack of co-ordination is the cause of serious difficulty and Overlapping, and should at once be removed.(2.) Purchase and Requisitioning of Supplies. Greater financial freedom is necessary in this respect. The Ministry of Food must not be required to obtain previous Treasury assent in every individual case to purchases and requisitions, but within such general limits as apply to other spending Departments, should have power of purchase and requisition, subject to the Finance Division of the Ministry being satisfied that [1251] B 2
the terms of resale are framed with a view to avoiding any ultimate loss to the Exchequer. Only where such a loss is definitely contemplated should Treasury sanction be necessary. Similar freedom is required in the giving of guarantees to private traders against loss, where such guarantees are necessary to maintain imports. The present system involves serious delays and makes it impossible to purchase to the best advantage.(3.) Imports of Tea. Shortage of tea is one of the most acute causes of popular discontent. It can be remedied by a relatively small expendi-ture of tonnage. The Shipping Controller should provide tonnage sufficient to raise the stocks at once in bond to 60,000,000 lb. after the grocers&apos; stocks have been replenished. Further, the restriction on the importation of China and Java tea should be removed. This requires a Cabinet decision.(4.) Protection of Labour. The essential labour in Hour-mills and other food factories must be protected from military service.(5.) Accomodation, Staff, &amp;c. The development of the Ministry&apos;s work has been very seriously hampered by insufficiency and inconvenience of accommodation. I realise, of course, the difficulties of the Office of Works, and I do not wish to bring matters of detail before the War Cabinet, but I do ask for a decision to be communicated to a.11 the Departments concerned to the effect that in respect of accommodation, printing, and so forth, the claims of the Ministry should be treated as of the first urgency. I ask also for a minute requesting Departments to go to great lengths in placing at our disposal sufficient officers of administrative experience.I ask accordingly for decisions of the War Cabinet on the main and the subsidiary points set out above. In an appendix, I attach a note on Mr. Austen Chamberlain&apos;s minute. I shall be prepared, if desired, to deal more fully with questions of distribution and prices in a subsequent memorandum.RHONDDA.Ministry of Food,December 10, 1917.APPENDIX.Note on Mr. Austen Chamberlain&apos;s Memorandum of December 6th (67.T.-2876).It is common ground that the present time inequality in the distribution of food and still more the suspicion of inequality, whether the fact be there or not, are responsible for a large amount of popular discontent. Evidence is being received on ail sides of a demand for rationing, both to secure fair distribution and to allay suspicion, and it seems certain that no less measure will really be effective.Mr. Hubbard&apos;s statements, however, as reported by Mr. Austen Chamberlain, are based on a misapprehension of what has been and is being done by the Ministry of Food, apart from rationing for which they have no authorisation. It is true that in distributing controlled supplies locally to retailers the Ministry usually take as their starting point the distribution in some previous standard period, e.g., 1915 or 1916. It is not true that no account is then taken of changes in population or other conditions since that period.Distribution has in fact been controlled by the Ministry for an appreciable period in the case of sugar alone. There the supplies are distributed in the first instance on the basis of 1915, but ever since the establishment of the Ministry of Food a system of supplementary allowances has been in operation, to meet increases of population. Supplementary allowances have been made up to date in 179 towns. In some cases where the population has increased substantially since the first supplementary allowance, a further allowance has recently been made.In the case of bacon, the distribution scheme (which is now being set up for operation as from the 1st February) starts from the 1916 basis, but provides a special form of application by retailers for additional supplies on the ground of population or other causes. These applications will be received by the Food Control Committees before being approved.
In the case of butter, which also starts from 1916 basis, the Ministry of Food are equally ready to make supplementary allowances, though no special form of application has been thought necessary.Similar interim action is taken in the case of tea, where the definite distribution scheme is, however, less advanced. In equality in the distribution of tea is due largely to inequality in the purchases of the &quot;uncontrolled tea,&quot; which was in this country before control started.In all cases the method is to start from a standard period and supplement by special allowances. In the absence of rationing this is the only possible method, though it is necessarily incomplete.The real difficulty at present is that, apart from sugar, the various distribution schemes, though they provide for the point raised by Mr. Hubbard, are not yet in full operation (and could not have been put into earlier operation owing to lack of control over supplies). In the meantime, however, emergency measures have been taken to deal with acute cases.A special section of the Ministry was set up some weeks ago to deal, with local shortages. Whenever a complaint is received it is investigated, and the Food Control Committee is asked to furnish information as to population and supplies being received by retailers. If this information indicates that the district is receiving in any period less per head of the population than is known to be available for the country as a whole, a special allowance is made with a view to bringing the supplies up to the proper quota. Investigations on these lines are now being made in some fifty districts, and additional supplies have already been sent to several, including Birmingham, Coventry, Woolwich, Cannock Chase, and Hereford. The Food Commissioners have now received general authority to issue forms of investigation to any Food Control Committee where difficulty is experienced, and to give the Ministry&apos;s undertaking to make up deficiencies on the lines stated above.This method is necessarily very rough indeed, partly because of the difficulty of determining the population, but still more because of the impossibility of discovering what supplies are actually being received in a district. Birmingham for instance has several thousand grocers, served for each article by wholesalers numbered perhaps by the hundred. Nothing beyond a very rough estimate is possible in the limited time available.With reference to the alleged failure to supply the small shops, it is very likely the case that while distribution is uncontrolled the larger stores by their better marketing facilities do best. This will be corrected as the distribution schemes get into operation. In the meantime, the additional emergency supplies are often sent to the local Food Control Committee for distribution, and it rests with them to select the shops.As to. Mr. Hubbard&apos;s own proposal, mentioned in the last paragraph of Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s Minute, it is difficult to see how this could be made of any effect without being developed into compulsory rationing. Customers could not be tied to particular shops unless they were all centrally registered (to ensure that no persons bought at more than one shop), and the retailer would have no means of distributing supplies fairly among his customers unless he had evidence as to the members in each household (i.e., in effect a rationing card or cards issued by a public authority).o
