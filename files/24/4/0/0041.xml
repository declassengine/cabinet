Recommendations.1. It is now three months since the Economic Offensive Com-mittee was appointed. It therefore seems desirable to take stock of the present situation, in order that the Government may decide whether the Committee is to continue its work upon the lines originally laid down, or whether any change should be made in the scope and direction of its efforts, or whether, having achieved as much as could reasonably be expected of it, it should proceed to wind up its affairs.I have to admit frankly that the Economic Offensive Com-mittee has not made so mUch progress as I had hoped. In order that it should realise our original expectations, I am of opinion (a.) That the Government must first take certain steps which it has not hitherto seen its way to take, although they were contemplated when the Committee was set up.(&amp;.) That the Committee itself must be reconstituted on a somewhat different basis.2. It must be clearly understood that I accept sole responsi-bility for the following specific conclusions and recommendations which I now submit for the consideration of the War Cabinet and my colleagues on the Economic Offensive Committee: (a.) By far the most urgent need at the present moment is that the Government should agree among themselves, and formulate the broad general principles of their Economic Policy, and that, having done so, they should make a clearly reasoned and temperately worded state-ment of their intentions, for the benefit of our own people, of our Allies, of neutrals, and last, but not least, of the enemy. ** One of my objects in preparing the following rsport has been the hope that it may provide some of the materials necessary for such a statement.[145] B
(&amp;.) The basis of an Economic Policy, which is not vindictive but defensive, may be summarised as follows: i. To restrict, so far as may be, the resources ofGermany during the war. ii. To  be  prepared  against  the  resumption  of Germany&apos;s &quot;Economic Offensive&quot; after the war.lii. To prevent Germany from re-establishing or acquiring control over any of those industries or sources of supply which are essential to our national security.iv. To provide, in concert with our Allies, for the equitable distribution of raw materials, food-stuffs, instruments of production, and means of transport, so that the Allied peoples may be secured against starvation and unemployment during the period of reconstruction.(c.) The guiding principle of our policy is reason and security, not sentiment or passion. If we succeed in carrying it out, not only will our own economic position and that of our Allies be greatly strengthened thereby, but we shall secure at the same time a powerful vantage ground from which to negotiate when it comes to bargaining at the Peace Conference.(d.) To proceed with our Economic measures piecemeal, as we have done hitherto, is not only fruitless but dangerous. By bringing forward various practical proposals before the basis of our policy was settled and approved, we have so far neglected the opportunity of enlisting the support and enthusiasm of our own people. On the contrary we have sown a crop of con-fusion, doubt, and suspicion in their minds. And on the other hand, comparatively little moral effect has been produced upon the enemy.(e.) Having got the general principles of our policy approved by our own people as to which I think there should be no difficulty, for these principles are latent in the minds of at least nine men out of ten we can then proceed safely to bring forward practical measures for carrying out our policy.(/.) Having got our own people behind us, and having made a practical beginning on a clearly defined policy, we can then hope to bring our Allies into a more compre-hensive arrangements(g.) This will enable the Allies gradually and rapidly to build up a very formidable working system of the Economic kind, which, as it will be actually in operation before the cessation of war, will give them something tangible to bargain about. If any clauses of this agreed and operative system are to be abrogated, then our enemies must give us value in exchange for our concessions.(h.) The &quot;Economic Offensive&quot; is too narrow an aim to justify the continuance of a Cabinet Committee. In order that any useful purpose may be achieved, our warrant should be widened so as to include the wholegroblem of 11 Economic Defence and Development.&quot; &apos;ur proceedings from the very beginning seem to show the impossibility of keeping within the pre-scribed limits, while the result of straying beyond them can only be to produce overlapping.* There are, however, certain matters of the strict &quot; offensive,&quot; such as Financial Bloekade, Statutory Lists, &amp;c, in regard to which the co-operation of the United States of America is of the most pressing urgency.
//. Reasons which led to the Appointment of the EconomicOffensive Committee.3. The War Cabinet will remember that on the 20th of last September, I submitted to their notice a Memorandum on Economic Offensive (G.-156).4. In this Memorandum I called attention to the failure of British Governments so far (a.) To give effect to the resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference of June 1916, which it is impossible to jettison without loss of credit,(b.) To carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report (9th November, 1916) of Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee on &quot; Commercial and Industrial Policy.&quot;(c.) To respond to the Note of the French Government (16th April, 1917) in which attention was drawn to the urgency of denouncing existing commercial treaties, in order to free the hands of&apos; the Allies from the restric-tions which are imposed on Economic Offensive by the most-favoured-nation clauses.5. The recommendations which I then put forward were based upon two considerations which had been already laid before the War Cabinet by Mr. (now Sir) Ernest Pollock in his paper on &quot; Trade War &quot; &quot;(27th June, 1917), viz:-(a.) That reliable information from Germany pointed to the fact that a considerable body of influential opinion in that country was greatly perturbed by the fear that an economic policy might be agreed upon among the Allies.(&amp;.) That, in order to take present advantage of this fear, and also in order to have something tangible to bargain with in peace negotiations (as a counterpoise to the German occupation of Allied territories), it is essential to agree the principles of economic policy among the Allies, so that the machinery for the proposed Economic Policy may be actually at work before the actual occasion for bargaining arises.  For, obviously,(i.) At the same time, a sub-committee of this body should continue to devote itself to the special study of the &quot; offensive &quot; possibilities which are contained in our general Economic policy.(j.) The questions of Economic Defence and Development form a part perhaps the most important part of the problem of reconstruction.(k.) A Cabinet Committee is an essential part of the machinery required for dealing with these ques-tions of Economic Defence and Development; for no other arrangement will provide the authority necessary for co-ordinating the efforts of the various Depart-ments concerned.(I.) In order to carry out a policy of Economic Defence and Development, a Minister of Reconstruction is quite as essential as a Cabinet Committee; but in a Ministry of Reconstruction there are certain obvious dangers which must be carefully guarded against, in order to prevent those misunderstandings and delays which are inevitable if the same work is undertaken by two different sets of authorities.
such an arrangement, if it were already in existence and at work, would be much more valuable for both objects than any vague threats or half-formed intentions.6. Prom the memoranda submitted at various dates between the 28th September and the 8th October last, by the Minister of Blockade (G.-159), by the Minister of Reconstruction (G.-160), by the President of the Board of Trade (G.-158), and by the Secretary of State for India (G.-161), it was clear that the ideas contained in my Memorandum had already been considered by them from their different standpoints, and with the advantage of much greater technical knowledge that I can lay claim to. Upon the fundamental principles there appeared, however, to be general agreement.7. At a meeting of the War Cabinet held on the 9th October, the above-mentioned Memoranda were considered.The advantage to the Allies in shaping forthwith an Economic Policy, which might be used as a lever against the German occu-pation of Allied territory, was recognised.It was decided to set up a Committee to study this question from the British point of view, as a preliminary to a comprehen-8i ve agreement with France and the United States of-America.The appointment of this Committee was not, however, to preclude the continuance of the Economic Offensive on existing lines.The present Economic Offensive Committee was accordingly constituted; but the announcement of its appointment was post-poned until the Board of Trade had dealt with certain proposals which had been put forward by M. Clementel. No announcement of the appointment has yet been made.8. At the date of my original Memorandum there had already been serious delays (a.) Of fifteen months in the matter of the Paris Resolutions.(&amp;.) Of eleven months in regard to the recommendations of Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee.(c.) Of five months in responding to the suggestions of the French Government for doing away with the most-favoured-nation clauses.I would point out that another three months have since passed; and although there have been beginnings in certain directions, very little has yet been actually achieved in reference to these matters. The most important thing which has been accoin-plished so far is the action taken by the United States of America in putting the &quot; Black List &quot; policy into force. Unless at an early date there is a change in the spirit of our administration, there is a danger that we shall be &quot; too late.&quot;III. Summary of Economic Offensive Committee Interim Reports and of the Results which have followed:9. Interim Report No. I made certain recommendations for the establishment of a stringent Financial Blockade in co-operation with France and the United States of America.The War Cabinet approved these suggestions on the 5th November. It was agreed that the forthcoming visit to this country of the American representative (Mr. Crosby) would afford a good opportunity for pressing the matter.The effectiveness of Financial Blockade will be lessened by every day&apos;s delay in putting it into force. I feel justified, there-fore, in expressing concern at not having heard that the negotia-tions with Mr. Crosby have yet led to any result.10. Interim Report No. 2 recommended immediate legislation in the shape of the A1&apos;on-Ferrous Metals Bill in order to prevent a
Te-establishment of the almost complete control which Germany-had secured over this essential group of trades prior to the war.The War Cabinet assented to this proposal on the 5th November, and the Non-Ferrous Metals Bill was accordingly brought in without undue delay. This measure, nevertheless, instead of being passed forthwith, had only just entered upon the Committee stage in the House of Commons at the date of the adjournment of Parliament.The delay, and the nature of the political opposition to this Bill, must have given considerable encouragement to the enemy. These were due mainly to two causes (1.) To the failure to offer any clear, temperate, and compre-hensive statement of Government policy in regard to Economic Policy as a whole; and(2.) To a want of foresight with regard to House of Commons opinion.11. Interim Report No. 3 recommended immediate legislation in the shape of the Imports and Exports (Restriction) Bill, in order to continue for a period of years after peace shall have been signed, the Powers with certain additions to them which Government has possessed and exercised during the war with respect to the regulation of imports and exports.The War Cabinet assented to this proposal on the 5th November,- and the Imports and Exports (Restriction) Bill was accordingly brought in; but for one cause and another it has not yet been proceeded with.12. I desire to call the attention of the War Cabinet to the fact that, at their meeting on the 5th November, in urging the adoption of these three interim reports on Financial Blockade, Non-Ferrous Metals Bill, and Imports and Exports (Restriction) Bill, I strongly supported the views of the Economic Offensive Committee that a general, authoritative statement of the Governments Economic Policy should be made at once, both for the purpose of impressing public opinion in Germany, and of preventing misunderstanding and suspicion among the various political parties at home.No such statement has yet been made. In spite of this omission a certain impression seems to have been produced in Germany by the Non-Ferrous Metals Bill. On the other hand quite needless and mischievous misunderstandings and suspicions have arisen in this country. As a result, opposition in the House of Commons has been allowed to gather to a head, which it is extremely urgent should be lanced before the inflammation spreads further.13. It is impossible to exaggerate the need for putting forward at once a statement of our Economic Policy either through the Prime Minister himself or through the leader of the House of Commons in order (a.) To set at rest the natural and excusable misapprehen-sions which have arisen in this country.(b.) To make clear to our Allies the essentially defensive and practical character of our aims.(c.) To let the Germans understand that our policy is dictated, not by any spirit of blind revenge, but by the stern necessity (which they themselves have imposed upon us and which will be intensified by each day&apos;s prolongation of the war) of safeguarding the sustenance and employment of our own peoples during the period of reconstruction.So urgent does this course appear to me to be, that until it is done, I feel the Economic Offensive Committee are only beating the air.  Indeed in some directions we run the risk of doing more - [145] C
harm than good by exciting groundless alarm among various political parties.14. Interim Report No. 4 recommended (a.) Immediate legislation to continue the control of Govern-ment over Shipbuilding Contracts after the War, so as to preclude the possibility that the output of British yards may be diverted from the replacement of our own vessels to providing shipping for foreign nations.(6.) A regulation under the Defence of the Realm Act to prevent work of this sort being begun or continued on foreign account.(c.) A clear and early statement of our own policy in this respect, so as to prevent misunderstanding and dis-appointment among those Allied and neutral countries which are at present placing contracts with British shipbuilding firms.The War Cabinet approved these proposals on the 14th November; but so far no steps have been taken to give effect to them.*15. Interim Report No. 5 drew attention to the vital need for setting up, in conjunction with our Allies, and prior to the signing of peace, some organisation for securing, during and after the war, a fair distribution of raw materials, foodstuffs, and certain other essentials, in order that the Allied peoples shall be neither starved nor thrown out of employment through the energetic, State-supported policy of Germany, which has been framed with the direct and avowed object of securing the enormous advantages which will accrue from an economic recovery more rapid than that of her enemies. We recommended, therefore, that the Government should at once approach our Allies (but more particularly the United States of America), in order that steps might be taken to guard against this grave danger by setting up a common organisa-tion, and by considering what legislation will be necessary in the various countries to bring it into existence.The War Cabinet approved these recommendations on the 27th November, and directed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should bring this Interim Report to the notice of* The following extract from &quot; The Engineering Review,&quot; of the 15th December, 1917, expresses a very prevalent view in business circles which, though favourable to the principles of our Economic Policy, are critical and somewhat impatient of our methods: &quot; It is doubtless very heroic of Lord Inchcape to declare, as he did at the P. and 0. meeting, that &apos; we seek no Government assistance, we ask for no contribution from the taxpayer beyond a fair remuneration for services rendered in the carrying of mails.&apos; But is he really quite indifferent to Sir Edward Oarson&apos;s hope that&apos; no ship in any shipyard will be allowed to be built for any country until we have supplied the deficiency which has been caused through our efforts to carry on the commerce of ourselves and our Allies during the war.&apos; ? The Government can do this by controlling the raw material^ used in ship-building ; and it will be most effective in countering the menace of the German subsidised shipbuilding programme.&quot; Sir Edward sarcastically remarked that when the Government suggests some priority in shipbuilding it will be told that it is a gross interference with trade. The attitude of the shipping industry and the debate on the Non-Ferrous Metal Industry Bill prove that his sarcasm is pointed and barbed. It is high time, however, that this kind of discord was resolved. The Government should recognise that the industrial fear and distrust of bureaucratic control is healthy, and is also an inevitable outcome of the irritating and complex regulations required during war. It should also remember that suspicion has been aroused by the quite unnecessary secrecy in which many of the reconstruction plans of the Government have been shrouded. Industries, on their side, might appreciate the fact that production and trade are factors which the Government must use on an Imperial and international scale for economic defence in the future. By means of union and federation they can go a long way towards making their influence paramount in the Councils of the Government. Mere opposition on an abstract principle like &apos; non-interference with trade&apos; will avail them nothing. They must come forward with a constructive policy of their own, and convert Parliament and the public to a sense of its national value.&quot;
Colonel House in Paris; and further that the Minister of Recon-struction and the President of the Board of Trade should prepare a Memorandum for Mr. Balfour&apos;s guidance-a Memorandum which should set forth definite suggestions for giving effect to the policy of the Interim Report.We believe that these steps were taken, but we are not aware that any results have yet been achieved.16. Interim Report No. 6 recommended (a.) The adoption of the Interim Report on Commercial Treaties presented by the Imperial Trade Policy Com-mittee urging that the most-favoured-nation clauses should be suspended during the period of reconstruc-tion.(b.) An immediate declaration of our intentions in this respect for the information of our Allies, of neutrals, and of the enemy. The policy recommended is essential with a view to the proper control and distribution of raw materials, &amp;c, as well as for other reasons.The War Cabinet approved these recommendations on the 3rd January last.17. Interim Report No. 7 recommended that there should be some relaxation of the stringency with which the Treasury Com-mittee for considering New Issues of Capital has confined its assent to undertakings which are directly connected with the war. To this end it was proposed that there should be a strictly limited right of appeal from the Treasury Committee to a Committee of Ministers of whom the Financial Secretary to the Treasury should be one.This Interim Report was circulated to the War Cabinet about the 6th December, and was considered on the 3rd January. It was decided then that the matter should be adjourned until the Chancellor of the Exchequer could be present,18. I have dealt here only with those activities of the Economic Offensive Committee during its three months of existence which have resulted in specific recommendations to the War Cabinet. The delays which have occurred may possibly have been unavoid-able, but they are none the less regrettable.IV. Considerations upon which any Public Statement of &quot; Economic Policy &quot; should be based.19. The Economic Offensive Committee does not seem an altogether happy title. Our proceedings have shown that it is somewhat misleading; and when a public announcement is made, the name will tend to create a prejudice against the recommenda-tions of the Committee, especially in minds which view with peculiar aversion anything in the nature of &quot; war after the war.&quot; I think the title Economic Defence Committee Or, better still, Committee of Economic Defence and Development would be a more accurate, as well as a less provocative, description. Economic Offensive is rather a German sounding phrase,* not very pleasant to British ears, and not very easily understood by the man-in-the-street.20. It also seems clear that any Economic Offensive which is merely &quot; offensive &quot; must fail in its main purpose. Commerce is a very different matter from war, and we are in some danger of being run away with by a false analogy. In military affairs an &quot; offensive &quot; is usually a sufficient &quot; defence &quot;; indeed it is often the best of all defences. But in the case of trade this is not so.* I think, as a matter of fact, it &quot;was taken from German documents circulated to the War Cabinet by the Reconstruction Committee.
Our primary aim is to place ourselves in a position of security during the period of reconstruction. Our secondary aim is to secure a powerful vantage-ground from which to negotiate when it comes to bargaining at the Peace Conference.If we hold fast to this positive aim of fostering the expansion of our own industry we have good reason to hope that we shall succeed. But if we are satisfied with a negative aim, if we and our Allies devote our energies merely, or mainly, to destroying enemy trade, without at the same time introducing and establishing our own, success will mean only a barren victory without lasting results. The destruction of German commerce, the cutting of threads in neutral countries, the uprooting of German firms and corpora-tions throughout the British Empire, are all excellent things in their way, but they will only be of negative advantage to ourselves, and only of temporary disadvantage to our enemies, unless we and our Allies succeed at the same time in substituting other organisa-tions in their place. Commercial opinion in Germany will certainty be alive to this distinction and will be much more depressed by a positive than by a negative policy.21. A general survey of the papers which have been circulated to the War Cabinet during the past year shows clearly, that in the strict sense of the Economic Offensive, there are two chief aims with a view to shortening the war, viz: (a.) Material injury to be inflicted on Germany while the war is in progress, so as to weaken her power of waging war.(&amp;.) Depression to be produced in the minds of the German Government and men of business which, as the war continues, will cause them increasing anxiety as to the future of their trade after the war, and which may in the end force them to seek peace in order to save themselves from economic ruin.22. But when my Committee came to consider the matter under its broader aspects, we could not fail to recognise (a.) That the direct material injury which yet remains to be inflicted upon Germany by this country while the war continues is of a limited character; although undoubtedly there is still much which can be effected in this direction by the United States of America.(b.) That, although the anxiety of Germany about her com-mercial future may undoubtedly be expected to exercise a very strong influence towards peace, so soon as the German people believe that they are in danger of being defeated in the field, it is not likely to operate effectively upon public opinion while the military position remains favourable to Germany for the simple and by no means fanciful reason that a victorious Germany would possess sufficient advantages of various sorts to enable her diplomatists to exact an indulgent treatment of her commerce as one of the conditions of peace.23. It has been suggested at different times, in quarters which are entirely opposed to the idea of &quot;war after the war,&quot; that by threatening Germany with a commercial boycott, if she will not accept peace on the Allies&apos; terms, she might be made to realise that the consequence of prolonging the war would be ruinous to her economic future. A formula has been proposed &quot; that for every month the war continues beyond a given date the boycott shall remain in force for a year.&quot;We have considered, but we are unable to accept, either the general principle or the particular formula.  Both are at the first
glance attractive, but they appear to us to be altogether impracticable, for the reason, that unless Germany is beaten absolutely to her knees, she would inevitably insist upon brushing this threat aside, as a preliminary to any discussion of peace terms; while the Allies, if they were in a mood to consider peace at all, would inevitably acquiesce in her demand, not only as reason-able, but because of the dangerous friction and exasperation which such a deliberate boycott would keep alive. We are of opinion that it would be a source of weakness, and not of strength, in negotiation to have put forward officially a condition which we can never be in a position seriously to maintain.24. Of course I fully realise that there is a purely &quot;offensive &apos;&apos; aspect of Economic Policy. If we (can ini any way weaken the resources of Germany during the war it obviously helps us to defeat her; in the same way as the blockade helps. And if tiie injury thereby inflicted is seen to be continuing, progressing, and tending to become permanent, German opinion may at any moment begin to be seriously affected towards peace. The &quot; offensive &quot; usefulness of an Economic Policy of &quot; Defence and Development&apos;&apos; must therefore be kept constantly in view, and I am entirely of the opinion that a special committee should keep watch over this aspect. But at the same time I think that this special committee should be something in the nature of a sub-com-mittee of the larger body which is concerned with &quot; Defence and Development&quot;; for the reason that the weapons of offence &quot;will be provided in the main by the positive policy which we are now endeavouring to frame in collaboration with our Allies.25. In this connection I desire to auote a few sentences from President Wilson&apos;s Address to Congress (4th December, 1917), which express the guiding motive of our mingled Defensive-Offensive preparations with remarkable felicity, and with which I find myself in perfect accord. After dwelling upon the need for a &quot;partnership of peoples,&quot; and not merely of &quot;governments &quot; after the war, he^ continues: &quot; It might be impossible also, in such untoward circumstances,&quot; i.e., if Germany should still remain under a government of ambitious and intriguing masters interested to disturb the peace of the world. &quot; it might be impossible to admit Germany to the free economic intercourse which must inevitably spring out of the other partnership of a real peace. But there would be no aggression in that, and such a situation, inevitable because of distrust, would in the very nature of things sooner or later cure itself by processes which would assuredly set in.&quot;26. The negative or &quot;offensive &quot; part of our programme is, therefore, really dependent upon Jie positive or &quot;defensive&quot; side, the chief aims of which are as follows: (a.) Government measures for securing our own people and those of out Allies against the evils arising from a world-shortage of foodstuffs, raw materials, instru-ments of production, and means of transport a world-shortage which exists at the present time, and which is foreseen to be inevitable during the earlier years of the period of reconstruction. ... As regards most of these necessities the Allies stand at a great natural advantage in comparison with Germany. The organisation of British resources under government guidance still more, the organisation of the resources of all the Allies by agreement amongst their respective governments would be, in fact, the greatest of all obstacles in the way of German commercial aggression, for the very reason that our objects would be defensive and not punitive. It would be a strong moral position to defend in negotiation; because any nation, or group of nations, has obvious justification for any measures 1-U5] - D
they may take with regard to the distribution of their own resources with the object of safeguarding their own people from starvation and unemployment. More-over, if the proposed organisation were seen to be actually in existence, and carrying through its opera-tions successfully under war conditions, it would be a much more formidable thing to contend against, than a vague project, or than threats which, as they had never materialised, might easily be represented, not merely as wantonly vindictive, but also as impracti-cable.(&amp;.) Trading enterprise in home markets, fostered by Govern-ment, for the development of certain essential industries which have hitherto been either monopolies of the Germans or tributary to their commercial ramifications. It is of paramount importance, for example, that before we engage in peace negotiations we should have placed our numerous dye-using trades, and especially our great textile industry, in a position where they will be secure after the war (so far as is humanly possible) both from (1) boycott, and (2) extortion on the part of Germany. This can only be done by establishing a British dye industry, an under-taking which is obviously (3) very desirable for its own sake and that of its bye-products (drugs, &amp;c.) as well as absolutely necessary, as experience has shown us (4), for the purposes of providing explosives in time of war.*(c.) Trading enterprise in foreign markets. This is a matter less for the fostering care of government, than for the granting by government of facilities to the trading community, whose eyes, since the outbreak of war, have been opened to the formidable character of the German organisation which aimed at ousting them, and also to the possibility of turning the tables on their former competitors. Government may un-doubtedly help directly in various ways (as, for instance, through the Commercial Intelligence Depart-ment, by Black Lists, by financial blockade, and by encouragement of banking), but the main problem must be solved by the bankers, manufacturers, traders, and workmen of this country in co-operation. Unless Imperial credit is prepared to assist British finance; unless British financiers combine their efforts in foreign countries without taking a too narrow view of thefr particular interests; unless they place their united resources of money and information at the ser-vice of British traders; unless British traders co-operate, or at any rate cease from &quot; cut-throat &quot; corn-petition among themselves; unless British manu-facturers avail themselves of the services of men of science; unless they settle their differences with their employees; and unless labour, having achieved a fair basis of remuneration and satisfactory conditions of employment, will put out its best work unless all these things can be brought about, the cutting of threads and &quot; bombing of German businesses &apos;5 in foreign parts will prove to have been a very barren achievement, and will be regarded by Germany, and quite rightly, as a purely temporary set-back, from which they may hope to make a rapid recovery after the war.* This aspect is very, fully dealt with in our Interim Report on Dyes 6.
27. For these reasons, despite the limitations imposed by its-name, the Economic Offensive Committee has been compelled by force&apos;of circumstances to concern itself from the very beginning with positive or &quot;defensive&quot; rather than with negative or &quot; offensive &quot; policy. Out of the seven Interim Reports which it has submitted to the War Cabinet only one that on Financial Blockade falls under the latter category;&apos; and even this single instance of the pure offensive is devoid of punitive intentions, being in essence as much a military measure as the maritime blockade itself; a measure that is, which aims at cutting off those financial supplies and credit facilities that to some extent are still being given to Germany by neutral banking houses. Of the remaining six Interim Reports, five are concerned mainly with the conservation and fair distribution among the Allies of food, and of the materials and instruments of production; while the object of the sixth (New Issues of Capital) is to free the hands of British enterprise, so that it may proceed forthwith to establish itself while German competition is still out of action.28. It would appear from the discussions which have taken place in Parliament and in the press with regard to the Non-Ferrous Metals Bill, the Imports and Exports (Restriction) Bill, &amp;c., that the Economic Policy of the Government is generally con-ceived to be something very different from what it actually is.The really remarkable thing is, that what the public imagines to be the governing motive of our policy is the deliberate infliction of injury upon Germany during the period of reconstruction and for ever after; whereas, in point of fact, this particular aim has not influenced a single recommendation which has been put forward by the Economic Offensive Committee for the considera-tion of the War Cabinet!The explanation of the misunderstanding probably is, that public opinion, not having considered the economic problem under its practical aspects, has taken sides upon a controversy which, so far as the Government is concerned, does not exist. One section of publicists is intent upon doing everything it can to injure the Germans for ever, quite regardless of our own national security and interest. It assumes that the Government are in sympathy with this policy, but that, owing to timidity, they shrink from the necessary action; and it praises or blames the Government accord-ing to the zeal or indifference which their various measures appear to indicate. The other section, which deprecates any continuance of an &quot; offensive &quot; after the war, likewise believes the Government to be secretly inclined to a purely vindictive policy towards Germany, and accordingly finds grounds for suspicion in every fresh proposal.29. These misunderstandings can only be cured in one way  the Government must formulate its policy, declare it publicly, and keep on declaring it; for there is no good in these times of saying a thing only once, if we intend it to be understood and remembered. If I am right in my conception of what the Government&apos;s policy is, I am certain that a clear and vigorous declaration of it would be a source of strength and not of weakness. The spirit of their policy, and the principles on which it is founded, would both be approved heartily by the country. It is not a policy which needs to be carried out furtively, or to be apologisel for; on the contrary it would be highly popular.The declaration of our Economic Policy might well be made by the Prime Minister as a natural sequel to his speech on War A ims. I submit that it would be much better that this declaration should be an entirely independent utterance to be weighed and judged by the country on its merits. For this reason it would be a mistake, in my opinion, to make it upon any individual measure which may be submitted to Parliament. It ought certainly, how-ever, to precede any further debates upon economic questions.
30. I confess that I am not in the least surprised at the manner in which some of our measures have been received in various quarters. For our general policy has never been stated; and consequently our particular measures have been praised or blamed by the one side and the other-and by both upon wrong grounds.31. To take an example: the opposition to the Non-Ferrous Metals Bill in Parliament and the press came mainly from three sources: (a.) From the Trading Community, owing to their fear that the Government policy aimed at putting them under the heel of bureaucratic interference.(&amp;.) From the Liberal Party, owing to their suspicion that antiT German sentiments were being exploited for partisan purposes, and as a means of making a covert attack upon the principles of Free Trade.*(c.) From the Humanitarians, owing to their belief that the Government policy was inspired merely by vindictive feelings against Germany.&quot;and that it ignored the ttrue interests of the British Empire, of the Allies, and of the civilised world.32. Nothing could be further from the truth than these suspicions, and yet I cannot wonder at their being entertained, seeing that the Government has taken no steps to put its policy in a true light; still less to conciliate reasonable criticism from the front Opposition Bench by insisting upon the essential continuity of British Economic Policy since the beginning of the war. It has neglected, so far, to make clear the extent to which its policy is actually based upon decisions taken by the Liberal and Coalition Governments (which came to an end in May 1915 and December 1916 respectively), and how far it is the natural and inevitable development of these decisions.!33. No doubt, in the evolution of this question, we may be hampered by old terms which really have no relation to the broad issues of British Economic Policy in the special circumstances in which we now find ourselves. None of the three Governments which have been in existence since August 1914 have been able to escape the necessity of imposing certain restrictions upon freedom of trade during the war period, and each has also been driven to commit itself to further restrictions of a similar character during the period of reconstruction, and even, to some extent, as regards the more remote future.34. The question of restrictions upon trade has presented itself to each of the three Governments which have been in existence since August 1914, under the following aspects: (a). As trade has had to be restricted during the war.(&amp;.) As it will certainly have to be restricted during theperiod of reconstruction, (c.) As it may have to be restricted when we return to normaltimes.The last (c) is an aspect which concerns my Committee only to a very slight extent. It has as yet hardly entered into our dis-cussions, and I do not see any likelihood of its doing so.The most drastic restrictions upon trade have been found necessary during the war. This is sufficiently obvious not to need any argument.In our opinion restrictions hardly less drastic will be necessary during the period of reconstruction.    In no other way* Even the &quot;Westminster Gazette,&quot; of 14th December, 1917. appeared to be genuinely disturbed on this score.f Compare Interim Report on Dyes, G. 187, p. 2, paragraphs 3 and 4, and generally. Compare also the statements of Mr. Asquith when Prime Minister and Mr. Runcinnn when President of the Board of Trade, which are set out in the Appendix hereto.
can the country hope to escape from the perils of hunger, unem-pj-ayment, social disorganisation, industrial paralysis, and financial chaos.35. There are two reasons of extreme urgency which make these restrictions necessary, and which force us to frame our policy if possible in co-ordination with our Allies and to put it into operation at once (a.) The first of these is the world-shortage of foodstuffs, raw materials, instruments of production, and means of transport, to which I have already referred.&apos;(&amp;.) The second is the German Economic Defensive-Offensive which has been a subject of constant study among our enemies since the early days of the war. They are deter-mined if possible to gain an advantage in military and political strength (i.e., in the wealth and national organisation which will accrue from an aggressive and successful commerce) by a more rapid recovery than their neighbours from the economic exhaustion caused by the war. Our knowledge of their intentions is not a mere surmise based upon what we have recently learned of their pre-war activities. Abundant evidence of their determination to gain a relative advantage over us in the first decade of peace, and of their confidence in their power to do so, has been laid before the War Cabinet in documentary form, not only by the Ministry of Reconstruction, but also by the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office.Under whatever title our Committeemay henceforth be known-the &quot;EconomicOffensive&quot; or the &quot; Committee of Economic Defence and Development &quot; it will assuredly arrive at the following conclusions with regard to these two points (a.) that it would be madness not to look ahead and provide against a period of scarcity, and (b.) that British industry must be beaten in a stand-up fight against the organised, state-aided efforts of Germany, if it adheres rigidly to the old system of laisser-faire, and refuses to learn the lesson, that in modern commerce, as in war, the power of organised combinations pursuing a steady policy will speedily drive out of the field the unregulated competition of individual enterprises.36. I do not dispute the truth of the view that the greatest need after the war will be the repair and reconstruction of the world. But just as I have already pointed out, with regard to the &quot;Economic Offensive,&quot; that there is a false analogy in dis-cussing commerce in terms of &quot; war &quot;; so here I must enter a protest in a contrary direction; for it is an equally false analogy to represent commerce (as is often done) as a form of &quot; friendly international co-operation.&quot; .... In truth it is a thing entirely apart-neither war nor friendliness.37. And further we must recognise that in recent times German commerce has been something a great deal more than a mere pursuit of the interest of private individuals. It has been regulated and fostered by a highly intelligent Government, which aimed at political objects both direct and indirect. It has sought to increase the total wealth of its own nation more rapidly than ftiat of other nations. It has sought also to acquire influence, control, and information in foreign countries. It has sought to monopolise industries (e.g., dyes and metals), so as to make the rest of the world tributary in time of peace, and so as to possess superior means of production of warlike material in time of war. The German Government has sought these things with the utmost persistency and with the deliberate political intention of making the German nation stronger than other nations. And the inten-tion of their Government has been to use the strength so acquired [145] E
to dominate the wojrld, not merely in war, but also in peace, by every means known to production, trade, transport, finance, and diplomacy. For more than a generation we have been faced with a deliberate German &quot; Offensive&quot; in matters of trade which, in accordance with our national habit of underrating our enemies, we have hitherto ignored or neglected. It would be absurd to imagine that after the war, unless there should be a complete change of heart, the German Government will adopt any different attitude towards German commerce. * On the contrary, the evidence which has been laid before the War Cabinet points to a settled determina-tion on the part of Germany vigorously to extend and develop a system which has been worked in the past with a very remarkable degree of success.38. It is very far from my intention to belittle the advantages which may accrue at some future time possibly in the near future from German anxiety about the Economic Policy of her enemies; but I have already stated my reasons for thinking that we must be careful not to build too much upon this hope until the time comes when the German people cease to regard the military situation as favourable. There is danger in over-raiting the power of this particular lever. For example, it has been suggested in certain quarters that we might relax to some extent our &quot;military offensive &quot; providing at the same time we developed our &quot; economic offensive&quot; with energy. I am sure we cannot afford to make any such exchange. We strangely mis-interpret the spirit of Germany if we imagine that a commercial boycott, or the threat of a commercial boycott, can ever become a substitute for victory in the field. I do, however, believe most firmly that, when the final issue of the stricken field begins to appear grave and doubtful to German ej^es, the economic menace may then play a most important part in ending the war.39. But in order that it may play such a part the menace must have assumed a concrete shape; it must have come into actual existence; it must not be a vague project talked about but not yet realised, or a mere threat of pains and penalties to be inflicted hereafter. What I desire, therefore, is a working arrangement  a system already functioning an organic institution which is seen to be growing and developing steadily into something always more formidable and efficient as the months go by. I want to put the Germans in the position of having to come to the Allies, begging that we will relax this or that clause of the agreement which we shall have made among ourselves, because a continuance of it would make their own future intolerable; in which case we should be in a position to reply: &quot; Well then, what price are you prepared to pay us for changing a state of things which is working admirably, and which really suits us very well. You can&apos;t expect to have something for nothing &quot; . . .&apos; . Anyone who has ever had to negotiate knows that this is a much more advantageous position for bargaining purposes than the other position, when all we could say would be: &quot; We have been thinking of punishing you very severely. What will you give us for letting you off? &quot; To which the proper answer is: &quot; Nonsense! you were never thinking seriously of punishing us.  Let us kiss and be friends! &quot;40. How, therefore, are we to get into the position of advantage?  There seems to be several stages in the journey (a.) We must settle first of all in our own minds the general lines of the policy we intend to pursue.(b.) We must then announce our plan publicly in broad outline taking particular care to avoid o^er-statement. A bove all, the guiding principle must be shown clearly to be what it really is reason and necessity, not sentiment or passion.   Our case, so far as reason and necessity* The disadvantageous rate of exchange which must prevail in Germany after the war will be a very strong obstacle to any change of the existing system.
are concerned, is unanswerable; and, stated in this way, it will assuredly commend itself to our own people and to our Allies, while it will tend to silence the objec-tions of neutrals, (c.) Having got our own people behind us we must then make a practical beginning, and prepare ourselves to pursue a steady and persistent course of action towards the ends in view.(d.) We must be prepared, if necessary, to make a beginning by ourselves, trusting that our Allies will gradually fall into line. I think this is the best, and probably the only way, of bringing about an agreement with our Allies. If we delay acting until we have obtained agreement with everybody over the whole economic field, the war will probably be over before we have come anywhere near attaining our end. And it is quite certain that, if we do not succeed in coming to an agreement with our Allies during the war, we shall not have the faintest hope of being able to do so during negotiations for peace.41. The mistake which it seems to me we have made, is, that we started to make a practical beginning in the economic region before we had announced and obtained the assent of public opinion to the general principles of our policy; indeed before we had even formulated our policy clearly in our own minds, and had agreed it, as a government, among ourselves.This error has not only been the cause of much needless and vexatious opposition, but has undoubtedly weakened to some extent the moral effect of our policy upon Germany. The &quot; British Trade Corporation,&quot; the &quot; Non-Ferrous Metals Bill,&quot; and the &quot;Imports and Exports Bill &quot; are all well calculated to disturb the minds of our enemies, providing they are carried through promptly and with clear evidences of practical unanimity in Parliament and in the nation. ,But if they are still-born, or if they are whittled down in the process of public discussion, or if there is an impression abroad that they will not be seriously enforced, then they are likely to cause more harm than good. For in that case Germany will regard them as mere &quot; bluff.&quot; The German Govern-ment (quoting from the House of Commons debates and the press) will represent them to their people as measures which are not seriously intended, and to which the trend of British opinion is traditionally and instinctively opposed.42. Another objection to acting before we have settled and announced our policy is the inevitable delay. Having no fixed principles to appeal to, we are forced to justify our measures piecemeal; with the result that we have to go over the same ground again and again, and expose ourselves at every turn to all sorts of minor criticism as regards consistency.V. Suggestions for the Reconstitution of the Economic OffensiveCommittee.43. I have already given my reasons for thinking that the Economic Offensive Committee cannot achieve much more that is useful if it restricts itself to the simple negative &quot; injury to be inflicted on Germany while the ivar is in progress.&apos;&apos;At the same time, so soon as we step beyond this narrow sphere, we begin to trench upon the functions of various Depart-ments, notably upon those of the Ministry of Reconstruction. A survey of our Interim Reports will show that this is what has actually occurred.It is very undesirable at any time, and more particularly so in present circumstances, that work should be done twice over- for [145] Y
this merely means that one group of workers gets in the way of another group of workers, and that friction and delay are the results.If, therefore, the Economic Offensive Committee is to be of real service, it seems to me that it should be reconstituted with a wider warrant, as the &quot; Committee of Economic Defence and Development.&quot; And if, as I am inclined to think from our ex-perience during the past three months, the newly-constituted Com-mittee should work in even closer co-operation than hitherto with -the Ministry of Reconstruction, then it would be wise at once to recognise this fact and to make the necessary changes.44. I may say, speaking entirely for myself, that the experience of our Committee has convinced me of the absolute necessity for some co-ordinating authority, such as the Minister of Reconstruc-tion. At the same time, also upon my sole personal responsibility, I desire to add the folowing considerations: (a.) That the Minister of Reconstruction, who is identified in a special sense with the whole sphere of Economic Defence and Development, cannot hope to exercise the influence which it is absolutely essential he should exercise unless he works through, and is supported by, a. Cabinet Committee representative of the chief Departments which are concerned along with himself in the performance of a common task.(b.) At the same time there is a. certain danger that various Departments may relax their efforts owing to an impression that some other authorities have in hand these matters of Economic Defence and Development. Unless we are careful to guard against it, this tendency will be apt to gain in strength as time goes on. Seeing that our object is to discuss and carry out our policy with the minimum of friction and overlapping, and with the maximum of energy and efficiency wte must take every reasonable precaution to prevent friction and discouragement.45. It is, however, quite clear to me that some body possessing no less authority than a Cabinet Committee, and no less representative than our present Committee, is required. It must meet regularly for the purpose of co-ordinating the activities of the various Departments concerned, in their different degrees, with the particular problems which we have been engaged in con-sidering, and with those others which we have found to be inex-tricably bound up with them.A sub-committee of this body would keep watch over the &quot; offensive &quot; possibilities which are contained in the general Economic Policy.46. It would be the object of such a Cabinet Committee to bring into close touch with one another the various Depart-ments which are engaged in checkmating German trade aggression and in forwarding British trade development; to let each know generally what lines of policy the others are pursuing; to prevent misunderstanding and conflict between them in carrying out their respective offensive-defensive operations; to enlist for any project (e.g., the &quot; Trade Corporation Bill,&quot; the &quot; Non-Ferrous Metals Bill,&quot; or the &quot; Imports and Exports Bill&quot;) the vigorous support of all the other Departments which sit round the Committee table; and to bring pressure to bear upon the War Cabinet, upon the management of the House of Commons, upon the House of Commons itself, and upon the press and the country.In other words, when the &quot; Cabinet Committee of Economic Defence and Development &quot; approved a specific measure or step, it would act like a Cabinet. All its members would be prepared to stand together, and to give what assistance might be required
APPENDIX.I.-Mr. Asquith&apos;s Views on Economic Policy.A speech (2nd August, 1916) of Mr. Asquith&apos;s, when Prime Minister, upon the Paris Economic Conference appears to agree in the main essential points with the views set forth in the foregoing report.(a.) &quot; It is desirable in the first place to make clear the intentions with which His Majesty&apos;s Government weint to this. Economic Conference. The main objects were two. One was to convince the enemy that the Allies, what-ever their individual points of view may be on economic matters, are resolved to wage this war with as complete unity and determination in the economic&quot; as in the military sphere. The second object was to make such preparations for the period following on a declaration of peace as seemed essential to the Allies in view of the known attitude and will of Germany.&quot;He then recites the preamble to the Resolutions, which is as follows: (b.) &quot; In face of so grave a peril the representatives of the Allied Govern-ments consider that it has become their duty, on grounds of necessary and legitimate defence, to adopt and realise from now onward all the measures requisite, on the one hand to secure for themselves and for the whole of the markets of neutral countries full economic independence and respect for sound commercial practice, and on the other hand to facilitate the organisation on a permanent basis of their economic alliance.&quot;Mr. Asquith continues:- (c.) &quot;That is the keynote of the whole proceedings, and it emphasises the fact that the view of the delegates at the Conference was that their delibera-tions were primarily defensive and not offensive. The war has opened our eyes to the full meaning and the manifold implications of the German system of economic penetration and commercial and financial control of vitally import-ant industries, and to the use to which vantage ground gained by this system can be put in war.&quot;Later on he deals with another aspect: (d.) &quot; We never realised, any of us, until the war broke out, how we allowed ourselves to become dependent with regard to these essential ingredients for the prosecution of some of our most important industries on sources of supply that were not only not within our own control, but that could be abso-lutely controlled by the enemy.   That, I think, is a most important point.&quot;He then describes what action has already been taken by his Government:; (e.) &quot; Some action has already been taken. The Board of Trade- are actively engaged in devising schemes to render us independent of enemy supplies as regards dyes, spelter, and other important commodities. A State scheme of assistance to scientific and industrial research is in course of creation, and, indeed, has been already created.   Investigations are being made by expertof them, in view of the fact that the particular step or measure had become a part of the policy for which they were all joiatly responsible.It would, however, be no part of the functions of such a Cabinet Committee to undertake any independent work or investi-gations. The work and the investigations would be done by the various Departments.(Signed)     E. CARSON,Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, January 21, 1918.
committees into the conditions and needs of a number of important branches of industry and trade, and into the problems of finance, and the question of commercial and industrial policy generally has been referred to a committee  I think a strong committee a committee which was collected from the point of view of representing not so much the interests or opinions of one particular section, but of representing every point of view that could reasonably demand recognition a Committee of which Lord Balfour of Burleigh is Chairman. The Government further are communicating with the Dominions and with India in regard to the resolutions of the Conference, and as has already been explained, when Lord Balfour&apos;s Committee has reported, a Conference will be held with representatives of the Dominions and India to consider the whole question of the Empire&apos;s trade policy in the light of the resolutions.&quot;Mr. Asquith goes on to inform the House of the special responsibility which the British Government had taken for the actual wording of certain of the Paris resolutions: (/.) &quot; It is perhaps right, and indeed necessary, that I should disclose the fact that three of the most important resolutions, namely, those relating to the most-favoured-nation treatment, protection against dumping or unfair competition, and the adoption of measures to render the Allies independent of enemy countries as regards essential industries, were proposed by the British delegates and passed at the Conference in the form in which they were put forward. I am not, I think, betraying any secret when I say those resolutions put forward by the British delegates were drafted by my right hon. friend . the President of the Board of Trade (Mr. Runciman), whose return to active political life we are all glad to welcome to-day, were approved by my right hon. friend the Colonial Secretary, and afterwards by the two distinguished representatives of our Dominions, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Foster, who took part in the Conference itself.&quot;II. -Mr. Runciman&apos;s Views on Economic Policy.That Mr. Runciman, as President of the Board of Trade, was in accord with the head of the Government may be presumed from the fact that on the 10th January preceding he expressed himself in the House of Commons in the following terms: &quot; Every one of these articles glass, chemicals, dyes, electrical apparatus, and I could name about a dozen others were industries of vast importance not only to us as a great commercial country, but as a fighting country. Without these glass articles, without some of the porcelain articles which are essential for electrical construction, without the best type of magneto, without some of the best of our chemicals, and without a great range of dyes, which used to be manufactured in Germany, we were placed at great disadvantage. Never again should that happen. This is more than a mere matter of competing with Germany. It ought to be part of our national organisation. There should be no essential articles either for the arts of peace or for the arts&apos;of war upon which we cannot within the Empire lay our hands.&quot;The whole of Mr. Runciman&apos;s speech is well worth re-reading. To my mind he makes an unanswerable case for an Economic Policy of Defence and Development.o
