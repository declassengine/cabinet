THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the  Cabinet.  June  1939.SECRET.Copy  No. .42CP. 131 (39),CABINET.NOTE ON  THE  PORTUGUESE ATTITUDE  TO  THE  PROPOSED             ANGLO-FRENCH-SOVIET  AGREEMENT.    I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, a record of a conver-sation between Sir G. Mounsey and the Portuguese Ambassador on the 1st June,on the subject of the Portuguese attitude towards the proposed  Anglo-French-Soviet Agreement.Foreign Office,      June 5, 1939.  RECORD OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN SIR G. MOUNSEY AND THE PORTUGUESE                               AMBASSADOR.    THE Portuguese Ambassador came to see me this afternoon and informed me  that our Ambassador in Lisbon had recently shown the Portuguese Govern-ment the text of  the draft agreement, which we had submitted to Moscow for an anglo-French-Soviet Defensive Agreement.    The Portuguese Government greatly appreciated the courtesy of this com-munication, but  Dr.  Salazar had thought  it desirable to convey verbally to HisMajesty&apos;s Government an intimation  of his own Governments attitude to SovietRussia.    Dr. Monteiro was therefore instructed  to make a verbal communication in the sense of the annexed document, which he emphasised was not to be regarded asa written official communication.    In commenting on the situation, Dr.  Monteiro told me of  the horror withyvhich Soviet Russia is regarded in Portugal.   Owing to her own past experiences,Portugal regarded Russian influence as a kind of disease which must at all costsbe kept from her coasts,  and when Soviet  ships enter Portuguese harbours theyare severely segregated, as though they were  carriers of cholera.    The Ambassador admitted that  the English mentality was  probably proofagainst such influences, owing to its individuality.  But this was not the case withthe Latin nations,  and the repercussions of any closer connexion between SovietRussia and the  Western/Powers in  countries like Portugal,  Spain and north africa, to mention no others, were, he feared, likely to be very unfavourable.  Heremarked that he remembered  when the Franco-Russian Agreement was signed,M. Laval had told him that for the first time he foiind signs of Russian influenceemerging  in unexpected  quarters in his own country, and that there had been a vigorous effort to capture the Ministry of the Interior for Russian ends.H.G. MOUNSEY.June 1, 1939.10418 [19371]
ANNEX.          Memorandum communicated by the Portuguese Ambassador.    ALTHOUGH we are in no way concerned with agreements entered into by great Britain with other States which do not affect our alliance, nevertheless weare led by the attitude we have taken up in the past to affirm our lack of faith inthe aid promised by Soviet Russia to any country, and our fear that the drawbacksmay outweigh any possible advantages as regards the position of third Powers notonly in the east of Europe but also others which we do not want to see attractedto the other side owing to apprehensions derived from  the appearance of russian the politics of Europe.    So far as we are concerned, ounpolicy towards Russia is so clearly defined as not to require further explanation, nor will  it undergo modification whatever maybe the position in which that country may  find  itself in relation to our ally.
