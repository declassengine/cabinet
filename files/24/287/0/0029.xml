(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERN!D3NT). SECRET. CP. 146 (59).                                        COPY NO.    ly                         C A B. I N E T.                    Survey of War Plans  in the                  Economic and Financial Spheres.            Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.          1.      I have recently &quot;been considering  whether  it would          not  now be desirable to institute some general survey  of  the          various plans and measures which have been devised with the          object of maintaining the economic life  of the country in          time of war.          2.      A feeling that something of this  kind is  needed has          recently shown itself in various quarters.    The Lord  Privy-          Seal a few weeks  ago received  a Memorandum drawn up by Sir  A.          Salter,  Sir G.  Schuster and others,  on the subject  of  &quot;Economic          Defence&quot;,  suggesting the formation by His  Majesty&apos;s Government          of &quot;An Economic General Staff&quot;  and of an &quot;Association&quot; of          outside  interests  to work in co-operation with it.  At about          the  same  time,  the Prime Minister&apos;s  Panel  of  Industrialists          produced  a memorandum on, &quot;Industry in War&quot;, forwarding it to          the  Prime  Minister with a  suggestion that  there  should be set          up a Department of Economic  Planning.  The Lord  Privy  Seal          has&apos;  told me that while  he  does  not feel  drawn  to  these          particular suggestions,  he feels  that  some action should be          taken  to  clew up more firmly the various measures which have         been under examination  as  separate problems,  to  fill in gaps          which  still exist and  to place  commerce  and industry in a         position to relate their own plans more  closely  and more          intelligently to the policy of  the Government.                                 -1-
9,0 M 3.     I have considered the possibility of setting up  a Committee to watch&apos;over the progress of these matters, but have come to the conclusion that it would be preferable to select an individual with the necessary knowledge and experience and to ask him to undertake a review of the plans and proposals that have hitherto been prepared by various Departments for the purpose of keeping the country going during war, in order to  advise whether the various&apos; plans and proposals are consistent in themselves with one another and at the same time adequately cover the ground.   A review of this kind made by the appropriate individual would give an opportunity not only to assure all concerned that the work so  far^done is on right lines, but would  also provide a means  of ensuring that decisions which might have to be arrived at to meet our more immediate difficulties  were both right in themselves and not calculated to run counter to  what might have to be done.in the event of a war  emergency. Such a review, in addition  to shewing up  any defects or gaps,  would no doubt  result in recommendations in general terms as  to the  lines on which these defects and gaps may be dealt  with. 4.      If this course is to be taken,  it  is  essential that the  person  asked to make  the review  should be someone to  whom Departments would feel  free  to speak with complete confidence;   he  must  at  the same  time have  a standing thatwould  enable  him to talk on equal terms with Heads of departments.  I  have  considered whether it would bepossible  to select  a  senior Civil Servant, but there does&apos;not  seem  to be anybody available who has both the necessaryknowledge and experience  and is at the same time sufficientlyfree.   The alternative that has occurred to me is LordStamp,  and I  have ascertained that if invited he:-would be                    -2-
willing to undertake the task on the assumption (which Ithink  justified) that he could do what is required v/ithoutdevoting more than a part of his time to the work.  A greatdeal of work has already &quot;been done by Departments, muchof it reduced to documentary form, and Lord Stamp&apos;s firsttask would be to consider these documents, aided by personal consultation with Heads of Departments and others who are familiar with the ?/ork that has been done.  Itwould be advisable that Lord Stamp should be assisted byone or two economists and perhaps a prominentindustrialist, who should all be familiar with GovernmentDepartments and with the machinery of government, and thatthere should be placed at Lord Stamp&apos;s disposal theservices of a suitable Civil Servant,  if possible one with treasury experience;  it would probably be desirable alsothat he should have the services of the Cabinet secretariat.5.     The President of the Board of Trade and the lord privy Seal are aware of these proposals and have indicatedtheir agreement with them.   I therefore propose to inviteLord Stamp to proceed at once with this task and to make arrangements to give him the necessary assistance.
