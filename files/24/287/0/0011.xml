Memorandum  by  the Minister  of Agriculture  and Fisheries                 and the Secretary  of State for Scotland.         1.        As our  colleagues will be  aware,  the Milk Industry         Bill,  incorporating  the Governments  long-term proposals for         the milk industry, as  outlined in the White Paper on Milk         Policy of July, 1937 (cmd. 5533), was introduced into the House         of  Commons on  16th November, 1938,  As a result of the unfavour-         able reception accorded to a number of its more important         provisions, it was decided, as announced by the Prime Minister         on  1st  December,  1938,  that the second reading should be post-         poned  pending  re-examination of the whole milk problem.  The         Bill was subsequently  withdrawn on 2nd February, 1939.         2.        The  matters  provided for by the Milk Industry Bill         fell under the following main  headings:-                  (i)  the establishment of a Milk Commission to                       supervise the industry, to  advise Ministers,                       to  perform duties in connection with securing                       improvements in  milk distribution and with the                       economic aspects of pasteurisation, and to act                       as  conciliator and arbitrator between milk                       marketing boards and outside parties if invited                       to  do  BO;                 (ii)  Exchequer contributions towards premiums to                       be  paid  by milk  marketing boards in respect                       of  quality milk  production-                (iii)  Exchequer contributions towards the cost of                       schemes  for  the  provision of milk at reduced                       prices for consumption  by schoolchildren and                       expectant and nursing mothers and young children;                                    1.
                                                     ft 0                                                     a o       (iv) Exchequer assistance in certain circumstances            in respect of miilc sold or used for manufacture            into &quot;butter or cheese;        (v) regulation of the importation of milk and            milk products to secure the stability of the            market;       (vi) facilities for improving the milk distributive            service and an experimental approach to            rationalisation of that service;      (vii) pasteurisation orders;     (viii) machinery, under the supervision of the Milk            Commission, for coordinating the financing            by the industry of research, education and            measures for sales expansion.3.     While the representatives of milk producerscriticised most of these provisions in greater or less degree, the main attack centred on the proposals for theestablishment of a Milk Commission, for rationalisation of milk distribution and for pasteurisation orders.The proposals relating to distribution were attacked onbehalf of small traders in all fields.    Peeling was less strong in Scotland than in England,,4.     We have now reviewed the whole position thuscreated,  and we desire to set out the considerations which in particular have weighed with us in framing theproposals in this memorandum.     (a)  It must be recognised that the comprehensive          proposals contained in the Milk Industry Bill          are not acceptable at the present time.    In          particular,  public opinion is not ripe for          the acceptance of the fundamental arguments in          favour of rationalisation of milk distributionc

While the representatives of milk producerscriticised most of these provisions in greater or less degree, the main attack centred on the proposals for theestablishment of a Milk Commission, for rationalisation of milk distribution and for pasteurisation orders.The proposals relating to distribution were attacked onbehalf of small traders in all fields.    Feeling was less strong in Scotland than in England,4.     We have now reviewed the whole position thuscreated, and we desire to set out the considerations which in particular have weighed with us in framing theproposals in this memorandum.     (a) It must be recognised that the comprehensive          proposals contained in the Milk Industry Bill          are not acceptable at the present time.    In          particular,  public opinion is not ripe for          the acceptance of the fundamental arguments in          favour of rationalisation of milk distribution.
(b) Existing legislation, which provides for Exchequer     assistance to milk marketing hoards in certain     circumstances in respect of milk used in     manufacturing milk products and for Exchequer     contributions towards schemes for supplying milk     at reduced prices to those most in need of it,     such as schoolchildren, expires on 50th September     nextc    It is in our view impossible to     contemplate leaving the boards without any     Exchequer support against a recurrence of     emergency conditions in the manufacturing milk     market after 30th September next, or to allow     the provisions for cheap milk schemes to lapse,(c) The English and main Scottish Milk Marketing     Boards have since 1st October, 1933, been paying-     quality milk premiums at increased rates in     anticipation of Exchequer contributions being     made thereto as proposed in the White Paper of     July,  1957, as part of the Governments     comprehensive proposals for the milk industry.     They did so on the strength of a statement which     the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries was     authorised to make on 4th July, 1958, in the     course of the debate on the Second Reading of the     Milk (Extension and Amendment) Act.    We regard  it     as politically necessary, and we consider that     there  is a very strong moral obligation on the     Government, to make provision for the recoupment     to the boards, as from 1st October,  1958, of that     part of the cost of quality premiums previously     proposed to be defrayed by means of Exchequer     contributionsc(d) There is now very limited Parliamentary time for     milk legislation before the summer recess, and                 3o
                                                      no         any such legislation should be  as  littls         controversial as  possible  if  it is to  be  passed by         Parliament this summer.    (e)  At the same time we  think  that it is very  important         to limit any legislation  introduced this  session  for         the purposes mentioned in (b) and (c)  above  to a         short period only in the  first  instance,  and we think         that this should  cover the minimum period that         requires to be covered by legislation  passed this         summer,  that is the current milk year  and next milk         year, i.e., the two years 1st October, 1938  to         30th September,-. 1940.   The Governments  proposals         for Exchequer assistance  to  the milk industry were part         of a comprehensive  policy, and as it is now  only         possible to put that part of  the policy into operation         which relates to  Exchequer assistance, it is         desirable to treat  it as  an  interim measure  necessary         to hold  the situation until  further legislation can         be introduced next  session.    While this  will have the         disadvantage that it will not give the industry that         measure  of confidence in  the  future which would have         been afforded by  the more permanent comprehensive         proposals, it would have  the  advantage of maintaining         the principle that  long-term  measures  for the         assistance of producers should be associated with         measures for the  reorganization of the industry as a         whole.5.        In these circumstances,  our  general conclusions  areas follows:-    (a)   we are not yet in a position  to introduce any revised         1ong-r ange programmeI
    (b)   interim legislation should be introduced at once  to         replace the existing legislative provisions which         expire on 30th September next j   this should cover the         two years 1st October,  1938;,  to 30th September,  1940,         and should provide (retrospectively as from 1st         October, 1938) for Exchequer  contributions towards         quality premiums,  for Exchequer assistance on milk         used for manufacture on the lines proposed in the         Milk Industry Bill in place of the existing ss^stem         under the Milk Acts, 1934 to  1938, and for Exchequer         contributions to the cost of  cheap milk schemes  for         schoolchildren and for expectant and nursing mothers         and young children,    (c)   proposals for a Milk Commission, for improving         distribution and for pasteurisation orders should not         find any place in interim legislation this summer,         nor would it be necessary to  include in interim         legislation further powers in regard to the         regulation of importsj    (d)   any measure of a short term character should be         accompanied by some very general indication of the         Government&apos;s attitude towards future policy.6.        Arising out of these conclusions certain mattersrequire explanation and, in some cases, a decision by theCabinet.7.   Milk Distribution.          The proposals in the Milk Industry Bill for an experimental approach  to rationalisation of the milkdistributive service were not the only proposals relating todistribution contained in that Bill, but they were the mostconstructive part.   If it, is decided, as we think it must be,
        to abandon for present purposes the rationalisation proposals,        we are unable to recommend the retention,  even in a modified        form, of the other connected proposals such as those for the        possible establishment of distributors&apos;  boards with power too -        regulate prices and other matters of common  interest to milk        distributors, even if any of these could be regarded as        unlikely to raise serious controversy - which we do not think        they could.   At the same time the case for a determined effortj        to secure an improvement in the organisation of milk        distribution as part of a long-term policy still stands.        8.        This raises two main questions.    Firstly, hoy/ far        the Government should state in general terms their probable        attitude when the question of further legislation comes up        for consideration next year.   Secondly, how far any steps        can be taken now to show that the distributive problem is        going to be tackled as opportunity offers.        9.        As regards a statement relating to future policy,        we are faced with the difficulty that on the one hand we do        not wish to do anything to discourage continued improvements        in the quality of milk production by creating doubts about        the continuance of Exchequer assistance if needed, and on        the other hand we do not wish to give any firm undertaking        that assistance will continue quite apart from other        desirable constructive measures for improvements in the        industry, as this would make it all the more difficult to        secure adequate support when the time comes for those other        essential aspects of policy.   At the same time, it must        be appreciated that, unless there is a considerable change
1 no1 v-&apos; Jin public sentiment in the meantime, it will probably onlybe possible, at the most, in any legislation next year toput forward a further instalment of policy and not a compre-hensive policy such as that included in the Milk Industry Bill,Any present statement on future policy will therefore haveto be cautious and we suggest that it would be sufficient if,on putting forward our proposals for interim legislationthis Session, we were to indicate to Parliament that while we would wish to see the successful continuation of thatimprovement in the qualitjr of the milk supply which isalready in progress and are accordingly asking Parliamentto authorise substantial exchequer assistance for thepurpose, we regard this-quality improvement as only onemethod of achieving that increased consumption of milk whichis a&apos;major objective of Government policy, which would beincomplete if it were not found possible - we hope duringthe currency of the short-term Bill - to evolve further proposals for dealing effectively with the distributionproblem in long-term legislation.  ,/e would go on to saythat we still believed that the objective of permanentmilk policy must be a self-supporting milk industry,subject only to appropriate safeguards to prevent theprice-structure being under-mined by low prices of competing milk products from overseas.  In pursuance of that end we would continue to  seek a means of approach to problemssonre of which raised acute controversial issues.  We could also indicate the nature  of any concrete steps towards theworking out of a long-range policy  that we contemplatedtaking in the meantime.1C.       As regards such concrete  steps, the  only practical
step that remains open to us as a result of the reactions to our previous proposals appears to be to initiate an expert inquiry into the costs of milk distribution.   Weconsider that, while it would on the one hand be very desirable to take some such step to show that we are inearnest in this matter, it is on the other hand essentialto keep any legislation this Session as short and non-controversial as possible.   In the ordinary course an inquiry could be set going without special legislative provision, but experience has shown that the circumstancesof the present case are such that any inquiring body would find it extremely difficult to carry out its dutieseffectively unless it were armed with fairljr drastic powers for compelling evidence to be given and documents  to beproduced.  In our view what is really wanted is a  detailed and expert inquiry into facts and figures which could beexpected to give striking results that should have an appreciable influence on public opinion such as has notbeen achieved by general pronouncements on this subject madein the pant by a number of authoritative bodies.   The idealwould seem to be  to set up a small committee of inquiry, sayof three persons, with powers to employ accountants to examinethe books and accounts of selected distributive firms.   Thiswould, however, require legislation which would be highly controversial.    As a middle course, therefore, we suggestthat it would be desirable to announce our intention to setup a non-statutory committee for the purpose of inquiringinto the costs of milk distribution and to ask parliament in the autumn to pass resolutions conferring on that committee the powers available under the Tribunals of inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.   A detailed inquiry of the type we have in mind would be a matter not of months but ofyears and we should therefore expect only to have made a beginning
by the  time  any further  legislation had.  to be  introduced.Nevertheless,  a body of  inquiry,  armed with the powers of the tribunals  of Inquiry (Evidence) Act,  should have madesufficient progress  at an  early date as  to enable publicinterest in  and sympathy with  the work to be enlisted, and inthe light  of the experience  thus  gained  we should be in abetter  position to determine in connection with any milklegislation  to  be introduced next 3/ear whether a runninginquiry into distribution  costs should be initiated,supported  by adequate powers to secure information.11.  Pasteurisation  Orders.           We take the view that any legislative proposals relating to  pasteurisation orders that may be  put forward in  the  future by the G-overnment should be the  subjectof  legislation  introduced on grounds  of  public healthpolicy  and not  of legislation  introduced, as part ofagricultural policy.  In the meantime, it is possible thatsome local authorities may promote  private bills includingprovisions on this subject.  Since  the Government itselfput forward  proposals in the Milk Industry Bill, we recognisethat similar proposals put forward  by local authorities could not  logically be opposed in principle, but we attach great importance  to Government acceptance of any pasteuris-ation   provisions being conditional  on  the inclusion ofsafeguards at least  as effective  as those contained inPart VII of  the Milk Industry Bill.18.  Milk Commission.          We have already recommend.ed that the distribution and pasteurisation proposals contained in the Milk industry bill should be  abandoned for the  present.  This would remove the main  sphere of activity  of the proposed MilkCommission and  consequently, quite  apart from the apparently
controversial nature of the proposal, there would not appearto &quot;be sufficient justification for  the establishment of aCommission at present.   A minor- consequence  of a decisionto abandon any present idea of a Commission would be thatthe proposed machinery (part VIII of the Milk Industry Bill)for coordinating the financing by the industry  of research,education and measures for sales expansion which was dependent on the existence of a Couimission would also be abandoned.   These last proposals were controversial inthat the industry regarded them with suspicion  and challengedthe need for them.                  -                    &apos;         . - . &apos;15.   Regulation of Imports.            It would be undesirable, in an interim measure ofthe kind now contemplated, to provide for the permanentpowers in regard to import regulation to secure marketstability which were contained in part V of the Milk industry bill, unless such powers were essential in present conditions.So long as milk marketing schemes continue in operation underthe Agricultural k&amp;rketing Acts the Government  has power toregulate imports of milk or milk products, under theAgricultural Marketing Act, 1953, for the protection of those schemes and we are satisfied, that these powers, which arenow being utilised for the regulation of imports ofprocessed milks, are sufficient for all present purposes.It will be necessary to make this point quite clear inParliament since the omiission of the provisions thatappeared in the Milk Industry Bill  is likely to be regarded with suspicion.   We accordingly propose,  in  explainingthis omission,  to make a  statement  in terms to  be agreed     .              ;with the president of the Board of  Trade  to the effect     .........              ..........     -           -:....that existing powers are  adequate in  the  circumstances thatare likely to obtain during the period  to be  covered by  the                       10.
 interim legislation. 14.       Quality Milk PFemiums.          We propose that authority should he sought for making Exchequer ccntributions for the two years 1st October, 1938, to 30th September, 1940, on the same basis as was proposed under the Milk Industry Bill.          It will be recollected that attested herds at present receiAre a payment under the Agriculture Act, 1937, in respect of disease eradication plus a payment from the Milk Marketing Board in respect of quality milk. provision v/as made in the Milk Industry Bill for Exchequer contributions towards the latter.payment during the two years ending on 3Gth September, 1940, and ss recommended above, we propose that a similar prevision should be made in the interim measure.   The Agriculture Act provided for payments to owners of attested herds in respect of disease eradication for a period ending on 31st January, 1941, and under the Milk Industry Bill it was proposed to extend this period to 30th September, 1943, so as to cover the same period as that for which Exchequer contributions towards quality milk premiums were to be available.   We feel however that the question of the future of the Attested Herds Scheme is a matter tc which further consideration shouldbe given in the light of long-range agricultural policy as a whole, and while we do not propose that this question should be dealt with in the interim milk legislation we think that some announcement on the subject should be made. 15.       Cheap Milk Schemes.          We propose at this stage that provision should bemade as in the Milk Industry Bill which introduced a new formula, to operate retrospectively as from 1st October, 1938,
for determining the maximum rate of grant that could be madeavailable  to milk marketing boards in respect of the operationof cheap milk schemes.   While the attitude of the milk marketing  Boards and of the National Farmers&apos; Unions still remains in doubt, it is hoped that a provision on the milk industry Bill lines will eventually prove acceptable and will secure the necessary co-operation of the industry.16.        Milk for Manufacture.           We propose that assistance should be  provided inrespect of milk used in the manufacture of butter or cheeseon the same lines and in the same circumstances as proposedin Part IV of the Milk Industry Bill, except that we would ask our colleagues to agree to a slight improvement in thelevel of assistance proposed in the case of milk used inthe manufacture of butter so as to bring this more into line with  the level of assistance proposed in the case of milk used  in the manufacture of cheese.   The Milk industry bill provided for assistance in the event of average pricesof imported butter or cheese, as the case might be, fallingover six-monthly periods below certain standard prices;assistance was to be limited to a maximum gallonage of milkused for manufacture.   This was to replace the system ofmonthly guarantees, originally repayable in certaincircumstances, provided under the Milk Acts since 1934,The proposal to substitute a system of insurance over aperiod for a monthly guarantee was bound up with the proposalto offer substantial Exchequer assistance for the encouragement of quality milk production as the primarymethod of  assisting milk producers financially.   On grounds of principle, therefore,  it is important to retain the milk Industry Bill insurance system as supplementary to the
                                                          1 n n                                                          X \i ijquality milk proposals instead, of reverting to the MilkActs system.17.       While the l-.filk Industry Bill proposals have been severely criticised on behalf of milk producers, the criticism has to some extent been based on misapprehensionof the way in which the proposals will work and has been directed, primarily to the adequacy of the assistance thought to be so provided.   The effect of the proposals in the bill was, broadly speaking, to give about the same or slighty more assistance in respect of milk used, in the manufacture ofcheese than is given at present under the Milk Acts, but rather less in the case of milk used, in the manufacture of butter.   We think, that milk producers are justified in asking that, under the insurance proposals as under theexisting Milk Acts, the assistance provided, on milk for buttershould bo comparable with that provided on milk for cheese,and we would, propose to secure this by adopting in the firstplace a formula&quot;&apos;&quot; * for ascertaining average import prices which,as befits a broad, insurance scheme, is more comprehensivethan that used, by the Milk Marketing Board, for the particularpurpose of its present contract terms but which gives a slightly lower average price than the Board&apos;s formula, and inthe second place to raise slightly the proposed, standard, pricesof butter from 120s. per cwt. to 125s. in winter and from112s. per cwt. to 115s. in summer.   We ask our colleagues toagree to this slight improvement in the terms of assistanceto be provided on milk used, for butter manufacture as beingreasonably fair to milk producers and. likely to mitigate tosome extent the hostile criticism to which these proposals have been subjected..4- The Milk Marketing Board ascertains the prices of Danish and  New Zealand butter, but it is our proposal to ascertain the  prices of Danish, New Zealand and. Australian butter.
