THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  June 1939.SECRET.CP. fS6 (39).CABINET.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    BY  the  instructions  of the Prime Minister I circulate  herewith to mycolleagues :     (1)  A memorandum left at the Foreign Office, on the 28th April by theGerman Charge d&apos;Affaires, intimating that the German Government no longerintends  to be bound by the provisions of thes Anglo-German Naval Agreementof 1935, of Part III of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1937 and of the supplementary Declaration of the 17th July, 1937.    (2)  A revised draft of the reply which it is proposed to return to this communication.    It is understood that the German Chancellor will be making a speech at the launching of a German battleship one day towards the middle or the end of next week, and it is, accordingly, important that our reply should  reach his handsbefore he does so.    Apart from drafting amendments,  of which the most important is theamendment of paragraph 3 to meet a suggestion made by the Secretary  of Statefor the  Dominions, a substantial revision is in paragraph 20.  The purpose ofthis revision  has been, while not detracting  from the desire expressed by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to retain the qualitative provisions of the agreement, tdavoid too definite an assertion of the view that we should in all  circumstances be completely satisfied by the resumption of the exchange of information.    The paragraph as now drafted is the result of prolonged discussion betweenthe Prime Minister, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and the First Lordof the Admiralty, and I hope my colleagues may feel that it adequately protectsthe position in both directions, viz. :  that of doing nothing ourselves to facilitate the disappearance of the qualitative provisions and also of asserting that the realbasis  for security in these matters  is an agreement on which both sides  can relyrather than exchange of information alone which may  be inaccurate.    I am circulating the paper to my Cabinet  colleagues and am authorised bythe Prime Minister to inform them that, having regard to the time-table and theimportance of getting the document into the hands of the German government without delay, it is proposed to send it off on Saturday for action to be taken inBerlin on Monday or Tuesday, unless any member of the Cabinet raises objection.    The paper  has been  considered by the  Foreign Policy  Committee and suggestions made in the course of the Committee&apos;s discussions have been embodied in the revised draft.                                                                       H.    Foreign Office, June 22, 1939.Copy  No.10436  [19459]B
Berlin, April 27,  1939.Memorandum communicated  by  the German Charge d&apos;Affaires, April 28, 1939.(Translation.)    WHEN in the year 1935 the German  Government made the British Govern-ment  the offer to bring the strength of the German fleet to a fixed proportionof the strength of the naval forces of the  British Empire by means of a treaty,it did so on the basis of the firm  conviction that for all time the recurrence ofa  warlike  conflict between  Germany and Great  Britain was excluded.   Involuntarily recognising the priority of British interests at sea through the offer of the ratio 100 : 35 it believed  that, by means  of  this decision, unique in thehistory of  the  Great Powers, it was  taking  a step which  would lead to theestablishment of a friendly relationship for all time between  the two nations.This step on the part of the German Government was naturally conditional onthe British Government, for their part also being determined to adopt a politicalattitude which would assure a friendly development of Anglo-German relations.    On this  basis  and under these conditions  was  the  Anglo-German naval agreement of the  18th June, 1935, brought into being.   This was expressed inagreement by both parties on the  conclusion of the agreement.   Moreover,  last autumn after  the  Munich Conference  the German Chancellor and the british prime Minister solemnly  confirmed in the declaration, which they signed, thatthey regarded the agreement as symbolical of the  desire  of  both peoples neveragain to wage war on one another.    The German Government has always adhered to this wish and is still to-dayinspired by it.  It is conscious of  having  acted accordingly in its policy and of having  in no case intervened in the sphere of  English interests or  of  having in any way encroached on these interests.   On the other hand it must to its regrettake note of  the  fact that the  British Government of late  is  departing moreand more from  the course of  an analogous policy towards  Germany.  As isclearly shown by the political decisions made known by  the British Governmentin the last weeks as well as by the  inspired anti-German attitude of the Englishpress, the British Government is now governed by the opinion that England, in whatever part of Europe  Germany might be involved in  warlike conflict, must always  take up an attitude hostile to  Germany, even in  a case where Englishinterests are not touched in any way by such a conflict.  The British Governmentthus regards war by England against Germany no longer as an impossibility, buton the contrary as a capital problem of English foreign policy.    By means of this encirclement policy the British Government has unilaterallydeprived the Naval Agreement  of the 18th June,  1935,  of  its basis, and hasthus put out of  force this agreement as well as the complementary declarationof the 17th July, 1937.    The same applies to Part III of the Anglo-German  Naval Agreement of the17th July, 1937, in which the obligation is laid  down to make a mutual Anglo-German exchange  of  information.   The execution of  this   obligation  restsnaturally on  the  condition that a relationship of open confidence should  exist between two partners.  Since the German Government to its regret can no longerregard this relationship as existing, it must also regard the provisions of Part IIIreferred to above as having lapsed.    The qualitative provisions of the Anglo-German Agreement of the 17th July,1937,  remain unaffected by these observations  which have been  forced upon theGerman Government against its will.  The German  Government will abide bythese  provisions also in the future  and so  make its contribution to the avoidance of a general unlimited race in the  naval armaments of the nations.    Moreover, the German Government, should the British Government desire toenter into  negotiations with Germany, in regard  to the future problems herearising, is gladly ready to do so.  It would welcome it if it then proved possibleto reach a clear and categorical understanding on a sure basis.
    Draft reply amended to  take account of Minutes of Meeting of F.P.C.                             on June 13, 1939.                         GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.    IN their memorandum of the 27th April last the German Government statethat, in making their  offer in 1935 to limit themselves  to a percentage of theBritish naval forces, they did so &quot; on  a basis of the firm conviction that for alltime the recurrence of a warlike conflict between Germany and Great britain was excluded.&quot;    2.   The German Government justify their action in  terminating the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935, the Supplementary Declaration of 1937,  and part III of the Naval Agreement of 1937, on the ground that the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government  showed that they now held the view that, in whatever partof Europe Germany might be involved in warlike conflict,  Great Britain must always be hostile to Germany even in cases where  English interests  were nottouched by such a conflict.    3.  The question whether  the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government can in anycase justify the German Government in terminating these instruments without, atleast, previous consultation between the two Governments is dealt with hereafter.It is not the case that in whatever part of Europe Germany might be involved inwarlike conflict Great Britain  must always take  up  an attitude  hostile toGermany.  Great Britain could only be hostile to Germany if Germany were to commit an act of aggression against another country; and the political  decisions,to which it is understood the German Government  refer in their memorandum,involving guarantees by  Great  Britain to certain countries, could only operateif the countries concerned were to be attacked by  Germany.    4.   In the Memorandum from the German Government the claim is made to describe British policy as a policy of  encirclement.   This description is withoutany justification,  and  indicates a misunderstanding and misreading of Britishpurposes which must be corrected.    5.   The  action recently  taken  by the German  Government to  incorporatecertain territories in the Reich, whatever may have been held by them to  be thejustifying reasons,  has undoubtedly resulted in a great increase of anxiety inmany quarters.  The actions  subsequently taken by the British Government haveno other purpose than to contribute to the removal of this anxiety, by assistingsmaller nations to  feel secure in the enjoyment of their  independence, to whichthey have the same right as Great Britain or Germany herself.  The commitments which  Great Britain has recently undertaken in pursuance of this purpose are limited, and as stated above could only become effective if the countries concerned were the victims of aggression.    6.   Nor have His Majesty&apos;s Government either the intention or the  desireto restrict the development of German trade. On the contrary, under the Anglo-German Payments Agreement a considerable supply of  free exchange has  beenmade available to Germany for the acquisition of raw materials.  This agreement is as favourable to Germany as any which has been concluded, and His Majesty5sGovernment  would look forward to  further  discussion of  measures for  theimprovement of Germany5s economic position, if only the essential pre-conditioncould  be secured, namely, the establishment of mutual confidence and goodwillwhich  is the essential preliminary to calm and unprejudiced negotiation.    7.   The consistent desire of His  Majesty5s Government, far from  being the promotion of a war with Germany, has been and is to establish Anglo-german relations on the basis of the  mutual recognition of the needs of both countries,consistently with due regard  for the rights of other nations.    8.   But, while for these reasons  His Majesty5s Government cannot agreethat there has been any change  in their policy or attitude which would justifythe recent action of the German Government, they  must add that in their view the main object of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement  was to introduce an element of stability into the naval situation and to avoid unnecessary competition in armaments.

                The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of  1935.    9.  For this reason  the Agreements contained no provision for  unilateraldenunciation at the instance of one of  the parties alone, but clearly contemplatedtermination or modification only by mutual consultation a procedure which HisMajesty&apos;s Government regret that the German Government have not  seen their way to adopt in  the present case.  The Agreement of 1935, indeed, was expresslystated to be permanent in character, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would draw the attention of  the German Government to the actual terms of the exchange of notes  of the 18th June, 1935, which constituted the Anglo-German Naval Agree-ment  of  that year, from which both  the  character  of the  Agreement  and  thecircumstances  in which its modification was contemplated are made  absolutelyclear.    10.   In the opening Note,  Sir Samuel Hoare referred  to the conversations which had taken place &quot; the primary &quot;purpose  of which has been to prepare theway for the holding of a general conference on the subject of the limitation ofnaval  armaments.&quot;  He  then referred to the German proposal for a  ratio of100: 35 between the fleets of the British Commonwealth and Germany and saidthat &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government regard this  proposal as a contribution of thegreatest importance  to future naval limitation.&quot;   He expressed the belief thatthe Agreement would &quot; facilitate the  conclusion of a general agreement on thesubject of naval limitation between all the naval Powers  of the world.&quot;    11.   In his  reply of the same date, Herr  von Ribbentrop recapitulated theterms of Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s Note and confirmed that it correctly set forth theproposal  of the German Government.   He  expressed  the opinion  that  theAgreement &quot; will facilitate the conclusion of a general agreement on this questionbetween all the naval Powers of the world.&quot;    12.   The wording of the notes thus shows clearly that the Agreement  was regarded as a contribution to the solution of the problem of naval limitation.  Ifthe German Government  now allege that the Agreement has a different meaning,His Majesty&apos;s  Government must observe that such an allegation finds no warrantin the terms of  the  Agreement  itself, comprehensive and detailed though theywere.    13.   The Agreement was equally clear on the subject of its duration.   in Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s Note it is stated to be  &quot;a permanent and definite agreement as from  to-day.&quot;  Herr von Ribbentrop  in his reply stated  that  the  GermanGovernment also regarded it &quot; as a permanent and definite agreement  with effect from  to-day.&quot;    14.   In paragraph 2 (a) of the Notes it is stated that  &apos;&apos; the ratio of 35 :  100is to be a permanent relationship, i.e., the total tonnage of the German  Fleet shall never exceed a percentage of 35 of the aggregate  tonnage .... of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations.&quot;    15.  In paragraph 2 (c) of the Notes it is stated that &quot; Germany will adhere to the ratio 35 : 100 in all circumstances, e.g-., the ratio will not be affected bythe construction  of other Powers.   If  the  general  equilibrium   of  naval armaments, as normally maintained in the past, should be violently upset by anyabnormal and exceptional construction by  other Powers,  the  German Govern-ment  reserve  the right  to  invite His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom  to examine the new situation  thus  created.&quot;  This was  the onlyprovision which contemplated any general modification   (i.e.,  apart from  thespecial case of submarines) of the terms of the Agreement;  and it will be observedthat  the only condition  foreseen that might  entail modification was a violentdisturbance of the general  equilibrium of  naval  armaments.  Moreover, underthe terms  of the Agreement modification  could even then only take place afterthe situation had been examined in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government.    16.   The  German Government,  however,  do  not maintain that such acondition in fact exists.  Still less have they invited His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentto examine the situation before taking their action.  That such consultation was essential is further clear from  paragraph 3 of the Notes, which states  that HisMajesty&apos;s Government recognised Germany&apos;s right to depart from the 35 per cent.ratio in the circumstances contemplated by paragraph 2 (c)  &quot; on the understandingthat the 35 : 100 ratio will be maintained in default of agreement to the contrarybetween the two Governments.&quot;
    17.   Even if the Memorandum  which the German Government have  nowaddressed to His Majesty&apos;s  Government  is  intended to be  read, not  as adenunciation, but as a; statement of the opinion of the German Government  thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government have so.acted as to cause the Agreement to. lose itsforce, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot admit that  such a plea could  properly be advanced without any prior consultation between the two Governments  as a reason for non-compliance with the express terms of the Agreement.                The Anglo-German  Naval Agreement  of 1937.    18.   Considerations  of a  similar character  apply to the German actionregarding Part III of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of the 17th July, 1937.This Agreement also makes no provision for  unilateral  denunciation or modifica-tion  apart  from the special  cases  contemplated  by  the so-called  &quot;  escalatorclauses&quot; which are not here relevant.  Apart from  these,  the  Agreement is expressed to &quot; remain in force until the 31st December, 1942.&quot;    19.   This Agreement  is,  moreover,  complementary to  the London naval treaty of 1936,  to which France, Italy and the United States  are also parties,and to similar agreements  between His Majesty&apos;s  Government  and other naval powers.  All these instruments have as their  object the avoidance  of  a uselessand expensive competition in naval armaments.  This may arise by one countryproducing special types of ships to  which  others feel they must reply; or byuncertainty  as to the actions  and intentions of others and the suspicion  that large numbers of ships are being built which must then be matched by competitivebuilding on the part of those affected.  The qualitative limits of  these agreements are therefore designed to prevent useless competition in types, and the provisions for exchange of information are designed to destroy  unfounded suspicions of excessive building.  Even if the relations between  two countries were not good,this  would  not  appear  to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to afford  ground forterminating  an  agreement  which  eliminates unprofitable competition,  andprevents a wasteful race in armaments which can benefit  neither party.Qualitative  limitation.    20.  It is in the light of these considerations,  presumably,  that the GermanGovernment desire the &quot; qualitative  provisions of the Anglo-German Agreementof the 17th July, 1937, to remain  unaffected.&quot;   In  principle, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would share this desire : but they are bound to point out that theretention of the qualitative provisions alone  will not suffice to create that feeling of mutual security, to which it was the purpose of the Anglo-German agreement to contribute, and of which the provisions for  the exchange of information  werethe expression.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would, however, at all times be readyto consider  with the German  Government the  possibility  in the words of  their note of reaching a clear and categorical understanding on a sure basis.    21.  From the terms in which  the German Government  announced  their decision  to retain the qualitative limits of  the 1937 Agreement, it is  not  clear what  are the exact limitations by which they consider themselves to be  bound inthe matter of cruisers.  The qualitative limits of cruisers are fixed by Article 6 (1)of the Anglo-German Agreement of  1937  as 8,000 tons displacement with  gunsnot exceeding 6-1-inch calibre, and it is by  this limit that all signatory Powersof the London Naval Treaty of 1936 are also bound.  Although Article 6 (2) ofthe Anglo-German Agreement of  1937 permitted Germany under certain circum-stances to increase her 8-inch gun cruiser tonnage, she was in practice precluded from  building more than five such cruisers by the limits of her quota under the1935 Agreement. Now that the German Government have terminated the latterAgreement,  the position with regard to cruiser limits is no longer  clear, but itis presumed that the limit to which  the German Government intends to adhereis that of 8,000 tons and 6 - 1-inch guns.  The German Government is requested to confirm this assumption.    22.  The past forecasts of strength at  the end  of 1942 and 1943  that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have made to the  German Government have been givensolely for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the  1935  Agreement.It is  clear that no further forecasts will be necessary since they were designedmerely to allow  Germany to make full use of  her 1935 quota.  But if  Germany
is to be no longer bound to a limit of 35 per cent, of British strength, it shouldbe clearly understood that His Majesty&apos;s Government can  no  longer be bound by their past  forecasts of strength, which must therefore be considered to be cancelled.    23.  In the last paragraph of  their memorandum the German Governmentdeclare that they are ready to enter into negotiations in regard to future problems,if His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to do so.  As indicated above, there results from  the recent  German action a situation which is  in some respects uncertain,and an exchange of views would help to clarify it.  For instance,  besides thequestion of tonnage and gun limits for cruisers, it is desirable  to know  whetherthe German Government intend to regard themselves as bound by all the articlesof the Agreement of  1937 other than those in Part  III.    24.  If, however, what the German Government contemplate is the  negotia-tion of another Agreement to replace those  provisions which they have nowterminated, His Majesty&apos;s Government would  be glad to receive some indication of the scope and purpose which the German Government would consider appro-priate to such an Agreement.    25.  In particular His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to know, first, when, inthe German view, discussions for the conclusion of such an Agreement should takeplace.   Secondly, His Majesty&apos;s  Government  desire to know how the  GermanGovernment would propose to ensure that any action in the shape of denunciationor modification of the new Agreement during the terms  of its validity should carry the consent of both parties.
