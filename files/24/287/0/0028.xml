Oi /f\ ftfhj J jtjIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC majesty^g GOVERNMENT.iECRBT.                                                  COPY NO. f)Q P. 145 (39).                                CABINET                  WAR RISKS INSURANCE OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES.               Memorandum by. the President of the Board of Trade.              1.  In his statement in the House of Commons on the           3lst January, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on           behalf of the Government that there would be a scheme for the           insurance in war time of all goods which, in the opinion of           the Board of Trade, are essential to the life of the community           during war, including the maintenance of the export trade.           There was to be no premium in peace, but it would be necessary           for the persons concerned to register at a nominal fee           sufficient to cover expenses.    It was ;added that it was the           intention of the Government in one form or another to cover           retailers who stocked essential commodities against damage to           their stocks.              2.  The Board of Trade have now, in consultation with the           insurance interests, worked out a scheme on the lines indicated           above, and I ask for the authority of the Cabinet to submit a           Bill to the Home Affairs Committee with a view to its           introduction to Parliament forthwith.    The provisions relating           to the insurance of commodities will form part of a War Risks           Bill which will include the provisions giving power to the           Board of Trade to operate the comprehensive scheme for marine           war risks which was referred to in the Chancellor&apos;s statement           of the 31st January.    Two parts of that scheme, i.e. the           re-insurance of British ships against King&apos;s Enemy Risks,           and the. re-insurance,  through a Pool,  of cargoes to and from           this country against similar risks, have already been put           into operation, in advance of legislation,  under the authority-1
Pi f\6 &apos;ij D of  the  Cabinet  (Cahinet 2(39)  Conclusion 9 and Cabinet  4(39) Conclusion  10).    3.   The  statement  also mentioned  a  scheme to cover goods in  transit  between  ship and warehouse.    This scheme lias now been &quot;worked out  and a copy of  it is  annexed.    The  power to put it  into operation will be  included  in the proposed  Bill.    4.   In regard to commodities,  the Bill would authorise the institution of a scheme under  which  manufacturers and traders would be entitled to  register  in  time of peace the  value of their stocks for which  they  desired  cover.    They would  pay a nominal fee sufficient  to  cover the expenses of registration, and the insurance companies  and Lloyd&apos;s  would act as the agents of  the Board of  Trade.    Hie effect  of registration would be to  guarantee to  the owners of  the stocks that they  would be covered against  loss  from enemy  action during an initial period which might be fifteen  days from  the  outbreak of  war, but subject to their  then  paying  whatever premium may be prescribed under the  insurance scheme to operate in war.   5.   The  Board of Trade  would also be  empowered as from the outbreak of  war to  institute  a scheme under which policies of insurance would be issued by their agents to owners of stocks of commodities on payment of a premium  tobe fixed for three months  at a time.   The amount of the premium would be determined  in the light of  circumstances at the time, but it is  not likely to be  less  than one half of one per cent, per  month.   Persons who had registered under the peace-time  scheme would have to pay the appropriatepremium as from  the outbreak of war.
    6, No distinction would Toe made between wholesalers and retailers and all traders would be covered, subject to there being a minimum premium based on the cost of insuring, say,  100 worth of goods.    7. In considering the details of the scheme, we have encountered some formidable difficulties, and there are points on which I consider that the scheme outlined by the Chancellor should be modified.    8, Strong representations have been made to me by shipping, banking, commercial and insurance interests that the scheme should be wide enough to cover practically all goods in trade.   It has been represented that, in peace-time, it is necessary to keep trade and employment going and that, in war-time, the restrictions on the importation and manufacture of unessential goods would automatically have the effect envisaged in the Chancellor&apos;s statement of. limiting the scheme to goods which are essential.    9, Moreover, once a scheme of registration in peace or insurance in war was in existence, the banks would tend to refuse financial facilities for goods not covered against war risks.   It might, further, be regarded as unpatriotic to buy goods declared not to be essential, and those employed in the trades affected, might be seriously prejudiced.   As rny colleagues will be aware, we are now trying to establish small trades in many areas, and I think that such a result would be unfortunate.   The distinction would also present difficulties on other grounds. I need take one illustration only - imitation jewellery cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as essential to the life of the community during war.   Yet a refusal to include it in a list of goods entitled to cover under the scheme might react seriously on employment in that industry.
                                                         9 h o   10. There is, moreover, inherent in the Chancellor&apos;sstatement the difficulty that any goods, however unimportantotherwise, if intended for export should he covered by thescheme.   My advisers have found it impracticable to deviseany scheme which would draw an effective distinction betweengoods of the same kind according as they are intended forexport or for the home market.   An importer would not knowwhether the material he supplied to other traders would beultimately intended for export or for the home market,  and the manufacturer himself, unless he sells direct for export,  wouldequally be ignorant.   11. Further,  the amount of goods that could be excludedas unessential v/ould be comparatively small and their exclusionwould be controversial.   I am of opinion, therefore, that no attempt should be made to distinguish between commoditiesaccording as they are essential for the community during war ornot.   I have every reason to believe that a broad decision onthis point would be generally welcomed.   12. The problem of the retailer has been most perplexing.A decision on the lines I have suggested in the matter of essential stocks would facilitate a scheme for retailers.   Itwould be extremely difficult to regard as otherwise than essentialthe ordinary stocks of a general store, from safety pins togroceries.   The insurance interests are, I understand, preparedto work a scheme for retailers, provided that it is on a voluntary basis.   They think that, if there were a compulsoryscheme for retailers, they would be flooded by applications from all districts in the country and that the volume of work would overwhelm them.   I consider that their conclusion onthis matter must be accepted.
   13.  This brings me to ray third point.  The Chancellor&apos; sstatement contemplated that insurance in time of war shouldbe compu3lsory.  Compulsion in the case of retailers, as I have already indicated, is unworkable;  and, on matureconsideration, I have come to the conclusion that it alsopresents very great difficulties in the case of the wholesaler,producer or manufacturer.  There are certain products, suchas quarr^r products, which are not normally insured againstfire risks, and I do not think that it would be reasonable to impose compulsion in these cases.  There would also  am convinced, be strong opposition from the farming interestsif any attempt were made to compel farmers, say in Cornwall,Cumberland or Argyllshire, to insure the&apos;ir growing crops or their cattle.  Some might no doubt be willing to take advantageof a voluntary scheme, but all would resent compulsion.  Yet,if the farming interests are exempted from compulsion, is it reasonable to impose it on other interests in the less vulnerabareas?   14.  The main purpose of compulsion would be to ensure thattoo man;,  of the bad risks should not fall to the Government.For either the general taxpayer would have to pay or, ifan appropriate premium were imposed, the traders in the less vulnerable districts would benefit from the disparity inprices.  The great bulk of the manufacturing and trading interests are, however, concentrated in the relativelyvulnerable areas.   15.  In all the circumstances, I would recommend that theidea of compulsory insurance should be dropped;  but it wouldbe necessary to institute a Government monopoly of war riskinsurance so as to avoid private interests catering for risksin the less vulnerable areas at under-cutting rates.  Allprudent traders may be expected to avail themselves of thescheme and the banks may be relied upon to reinforce thenatural tendency.
   16.  An integral part of the insurance scheme from the standpoint of administration would have to he that thereshould  he a minimum premium,the minimum being based on thecost of insuring, say,  100 worth of goods.   17.  A corollary of a scheme for war risk insurance of commodities on a voluntary basis coupled with a minimumpremium would be that no trader who failed to take advantageof the scheme would be entitled to receive ex gratia compensation Ifor the destruction of his stocks by enemy action under thecompensation scheme except to an amount which could be limitedto  100, and the burden on the Exc.heg.uer in respect of generalcompensation would be to that extent lightened.  Incidentally,this provision would meet the case of the small retailer withstock of less than  100 who might find it too onerous to pay the  I                                                                  1premium applicable to that figure, and who might receiveimmediate payment of compensation  .if hardship were shown.   18.  The chancellors statement contemplated an increasedfee for late registration.  In my opinion, nothing but a sumequivalent to an exceedingly heavy insurance   premium could actas an incentive to register in time of peace so as to be covered in time of war, and I consider that the idea underlyingthis proposal is sufficiently met by the fact that a trader,who has not registered in time of peace, will find himselfwithout cover until a policy can be issued to him;    19.  As already indicated, the proposals in this memoraiidumrepresent important departures from the Government proposalswhich are referred to in paragraph 1 and the necessity/- forimmediate legislation has not permitted the departmentaldiscussion with the Treasury to proceed to the point of reaching agreement in regard to them;  but I hope to have had anopportunity of discussing them with the Chancellor of theExchequer before next Wednesday&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet.oard of Trade, 30th June, 1939.0.F.G.S,

UNITED KINGDOM WAR RISKS                 INSURANCE SCHEME.   1. Cover against King&apos;s Enemy Risks without premium will be given &quot;by Statute to the  extent indicated below to  owners ofgoods which are in transit between ocean-going ship   andwarehouse (or vice versa) in the United Kingdom  at the timeof the commencement of hostilities in which  the  United kingdom is engaged,  and also owners of goods  which  begin  such transitbetween the time of the  commencement of the  hostilities andthe end of the seventh day after the opening of  the government war Risks Insurance Office by the Board of Trade.   2. In the case of goods imported, into the United Kingdom,the cover will apply from the time the goods are discharged from the ocean-going steamer in a port in the United  Kingdom(a) until delivered at first warehouse in the United  Kingdom,or (b) until the expiry  of 15 days if the warehouse to whichthe goods are being taken is in the port, or (c) until the expiry of 30 days if the warehouse to which  the  goods arebeing taken is outside the port, whichever of these periodsis the less.     In the case of goods consigned for export from theUnited Kingdom, the cover will extend from the time the goodsleave the consignor&apos;s warehouse in the United Kingdom en route for export and continue  during the ordinary  course of transituntil on board an ocean-going vessel in a port in  the UnitedKingdom.  The owner will be required to take all possible steps to ensure that the goods complete  the transit  betweenship and warehouse or warehouse and  ship, as the  case may be,as quickly as possible.   3. The valuation of goods for the purpose of  this  coverwithout premium will be  fixed in accordance with rules issued
ft  ftby the Board of Trade &quot;by Order.   (it  is  intended that the &quot;basisof valuation should correspond to  that laid down  from time totime in the War Risks Cargo Pool Rules for cargo insurance,but some adjustment will, of course,  be  necessary).   4. Claims in respect of loss or damage by King&apos;s Enemy risks to goods covered by the above provisions will be dealt with bythe Board of Trade  (Government War Risks Insurance Office),and before any claim is paid the claimant will have to prove to the satisfaction of the Board that he was the owner of thegoods at the time  of the loss or damage, and that the goodscame, within the provisions of the  statute.   5.  The Government War Risks Insurance Office will affordfacilities for the insurance on a premium basis of goods whichbegin their transit between ocean-going  ships and. warehouse(or vice versa) in the United Kingdom after the expiry of the seventh day after the setting up of the  Office, and also forthe goods referred to in paragraph 2  which cease to be coveredby the provisions of  that paragraph b ecause they have not reached warehouse within the time limits laid down therein.It is proposed  that the Office should have power to include theship to warehouse cover in the United Kingdom in insurancesissued by it in respect of the carriage  of goods by ocean-going steamer and also, in so far as it is necessary, to issueseparate insurances for goods in transit between ship andwarehouse in the United Kingdom.- 2 -
