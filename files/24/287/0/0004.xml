I  submit a draft bill  for the  establishment  of  a        Ministry  of  Supply  together with explanatory notes  on        clauses,  and a  copy of  a letter from  the Prime  Minister&apos;s        Advisory  Panel  of Industrialists.        2.      In pursuance of  the decision reached by  the  Cabinet        on the  19th  April (Cabinet 21 (39)  Conclusion ll),  a first        draft bill was  prepared and was Considered in conference        between the  Minister for Co-ordination of  Defence and  other        Ministers concerned.    The draft bill was  revised after        this conference and has been  further  considered in        discussions  between officers  of the Departments concerned.        It has  also  been submitted to the Prime Minister&apos;s  Advisory        Panel of  Industrialists.        3.      The draft now submitted has  been largely reconstructed        so as to  embody the results of the  above procedure.        4.      Certain  questions of policy  arise in relation to the        sphere  of operations to be assigned to the new  Ministry and        in relation  to  the  problem how far  it should be invested with        compulsory powers over  industry.        5*      In regard to the first point,  it.was decided by the        Cabinet on the  2nd  March (Cabinet 9 (39) Conclusion 4)  that        all preparations should be made at  once for the setting up        of a Ministry of Supply in war, if  the Cabinet  should  decide        to set  it up.   The necessary action  to give effect to this
decision was in hand before the Cabinet later on the19th April decided to set up a Ministry of Supply at once.In drafting the bill, attention has been given to theearlier Cabinet decision and the draft accordingly provides the necessary legal power to establish a Ministry of supply in the fullest sense, providing also that the powers actually to be exercised by this Ministry at any stage are such powers as may be transferred to it by Order in Council.   Abill in this form seems necessary under the Cabinet decision and also likely to commend itself to that strong body ofopinion in the House of Commons which has been pressing forthe creation of a Ministry of Supply with very wideresponsibilities.6.     The next question of policy is what functions are tobe transferred to the new Ministry by Order in Council, sothat it shall perform them from the date of its establishment.This initiating Order in Council must obviously be known to members in advance of the Second Reading of the bill.   IfClause 6 of the bill as drafted stands, the Order in council will require sanction by resolution of both Houses.   Ifsuch sanction is thought not to be requisite, the initiatingOrder in Council would be laid before Parliament in a white Paper.   I recommend the former course.7.     The functions proposed for the new Ministry in theMemorandum of the 14th April (CP. 84 (39)), on which thedecision to establish it was taken, were -   (a) the functions of supply, design, research, experiment         and inspection exercised by the War Office (except         in regard to certain Q.M.G. and other services         needing further consideration, now in progress),   (b) the function of the supply of such stores of general         user as may be convenient, and   (c) the function of provision of essential raw materials.                        -2-
8.     I offer the following observations as to (b)and (c) above.       As to  (b), there are certain articles of cornmonuser for the  supply of which, to all the three Services,one or other  of the, three Service Departments is responsible.   This system has recently been extended,so as to cover supply of certain stores to the air raid Precautions Department.   The distribution ofresponsibility for this or that store of this des-description has  grown up over a period of years and maybe found to require hereafter some adjustment.   Forthe purposes  of the initial Order in Council under clause 3 of the draft bill I think all that can be doneis to transfer to the new Ministry the agency servicesactually performed by the War Office and I so recommend.9.     There  are other articles of common user, either directly or indirectly required by the Service Depart-ments, where  the responsibility for supply remains insuch using Department.   A familiar instance of thisis machine tools.   Other instances are the supply ofuniforms, equipment and boots, which is now being organised on  a very large scale for the Army bySir Frederick Marquis, and the supply of optical glassand scientific and optical instruments, where the vastlyincreased demand for the expanded Army raises a problemof great difficulty, which may be found to requirehandling by a single executive authority.   It isclear that the responsibility for machine tool supply atall events must be transferred to the new Ministry from
the outset, and that the initiating Order in Council   ^must provide for that, and must also contain provisionfor the transfer of such other articles of common useras may he  agreed between the Minister of Supply andthe other Ministers concerned.10.     The transfer of the function of provision of essential  raw materials, (paragraph 7(c) above), was found on further examination to raise difficult problems.By the Essential Commodities Reserves Act, 1938, theBoard of Trade have statutory powers in regard tothe amassing of reserves of fertilisers, petroleumetc.    The Board of Trade have also had the general responsibility, through their Supply Organisation,for making preparation for safeguarding the supplyof essential raw materials in war and in that capacityhave taken a very great part in advising and assistingin the amassment of reserves of raw materials other thanthose covered by the Essential  Commodities Act, 1938.The Board  of Trade also have the responsibility ofmaking in  advance all necessary preparations for thecontrol (and supply as necessary)  in war of raw material and of those materials of common user which are the finished product of one industry and the raw materials of another.    It has been for some time approved policy that the central organisation which will be required inwar for this last function shall be part of the Ministryof Supply,  if and when established.11.     The Ministry is now to be established and it is approved policy that it shall take over the provision of essential  raw materials.   So far as preparations for warcontrol and supply are concerned, it would be an obviousanomaly if one Department remained responsible in peacefor operations which another  Department, now to beestablished, would have to perform in war.                       -4-
                                                      ** Pi                  f v                                  - /!12-9     The solution envisaged und Jc..jJa^BiJJL^. afterDepartmental^ consvJiJsd^sso^\&amp;..%o transfer to ztoB^BAm^MXn.l-s z*ythe existing Board of Trade powers regarding fertilizers(Clause 5), and to give to the Minister new powers toacquire commodities other than those mentioned in theEssential Commodities Reserves Act, 1938 (Clause 2 (l) ofthe Bill).    The Board of Trade retain the powers givento them by the Essential Commodities Reserves Act inregard to food and petroleum.13o     There then arises the question of the measure in which compulsory powers should be taken over  industry.14.--     In the memorandum on which the decision wastaken to establish the Ministry (CPc 84(39)) it was proposed that the Ministry should have a statutoryright to enforce the acceptance of and priority forGovernment orders, and possibly legal powers todetermine prices after a cost investigation (paragraphs19 and 20)0     The results of the further examinationof this problem are set out in Part II of the Bill.15.     It will be seen that  they confer on the Minister,on his own behalf or  otherwise, very drastic powersto require sun-plies to be delivered or work to bedone and to require production of documents orkeeping of records, subject to severe penalties and/orto the actual taking  over of  works or parts of works(Clauses 7 to 9).16.     The policy  hitherto followed in  the rearmament programme has been  based  on  cue willing  co-operationof industry and I should propose  to make it  clear  inParliament beyond any possibility of doubt that
the Government have not in- mind, any sudden change inthat policy &quot;but that the powers taken are reserve powers, only to be used in case of proved necessity.17.   The special attention of the Prime Minister&apos;sAdvisory Panel was drawn to this part of the bill and,as will be seen from the letter of which a copy is appended, they accept it as necessary in the present state of emergency, but at their suggestion a limitation to a period of two years has been provision-ally included in Clause 13 (l) of the draft bill.18.   The power to regulate export in Clause 11 wasalso included at their suggestion, principally  inrelation to export of scrap metal, about which they areconcerned.   The objection which they take to Clause12 has been referred to the Treasury, at whose request the clause was inserted..19.   There is one further point of policy.    Theprocedure by which the Service Departments can legallyacquire land is complicated and very slow  in operation.Parliament has been prepared  to give power to civil departments to act more expeditiously and  it has beensuggested that the Minister of Supply, as  a CivilMinister, might have similar  powers to act on behalfof the Service Departments.   I have made no provisionfor this  in the Bill, as  in. my opinion any such powers would be  completely outside the proper functions of theMinistry  of Supply.20.   It  is urgent that the bill be  introduced and passed into law  at the earliest  possible opportunity.    I
totherefore ask my colleagues for authority     (l)  to introduce the Bill substantially as now          drafted, with the necessary accompanying          Financial Memorandum.    (ii)  to ensure that printed copies reach          Honourable Members before the Whitsuntide          recess.   (iii)  to arrange with the Chief Whip for the Second          Reading Debate to take place in the House of          Commons as soon as possible after the recess.( Intd. )   E.L. B
      APPENDIX I.MINISTRY OF SUPPLY BILL,  DRAFT 7.Clause 1.       The Bill proceeds on the basis of vestingauthority in the Minister alone and does not prescribea council.  This allows resilience in the organisationand will permit of changes if adjustments prove to bedesirable as organisation proceeds.  A council couldbe set up administratively as was9 in fact,, done forthe Ministry of Munitions.  It contains also theprovision for a Parliamentary Secretary and Staff.       Sub-Section (l).  This is the authority forthe appointment of the Minister.       Sub-Section (2).  This is the authority for theappointment of a Parliamentary Secretary.       Sub-Section (5).  This is amendment of theMinisters of the Crown Act necessary to provide -          (a) a salary of  5S000 for the Minister;          (b) a salary of  1,500 for the Parliamentary                Secretary;both in substitution of salary as members ofParliament.          (c) the right to sit in the House.       Sub-Section (4) follows section 5 (2) of theMinistry of Munitions Act, and the New Ministriesand Secretaries Act, 1916.       Sub-Section (5) provides for staff being appointed with the sanction of the Treasury and hasbeen agreed with the Treasury.  It is in the formadopted for the Unemployment Assistance Board in theUnemployment Assistance Act, 1934, and may be regardedas common form.-1-
Clause 2.       This Clause has been incorporated, in the Billfor the purpose of giving the Minister powers toacquire articles likely to be required for the publicservice in the event of emergency or war and,, throughthe interpretation Clause (Clause 18) covers theacquisition of materials essential to maintain civilindustry., with the exception of foods, fertilisersand petroleum which are dealt with in the essential commodities Reserves Act,, 1958 (see Clause 3 below).It also enables the Minister to acquire articles forthe purpose of barter.  These -powers have beendecided upon in discussion with the Board of Trade,to cover operations which are actually in progress orconsidered to be necessary in the immediate future.       Sub-Section (l) is the main authority for theexercise of these powers and it will be noted that bythe proviso, they are not to be exercised in regardto departmental requirements unless the relevant powersof the Department concerned have been transferred tothe Minister by Order-in-Council under Clause 3.       The proviso is not needed if Departmentsgenerally are satisfied that their powers will be adequately safeguarded administratively.       Sub-Section (2).  This Clause extends to theMinister the powers which the Army Council have inregard to acquisition of land.       There has been discussion on the point whetherthe Minister should have powers of land acquisitionanalogous to those of the Ministry of Health or theSpecial Commissioners to enable him, more quickly than                    -2-
                                                ii jat present j, to acquire land either for the  use  ofService Departments or for his own purposes, hut itis felt that general power to acquire land  is not  asuitable duty to place upon the Minister and that since the passing of the Reserve Forces Act the needfor additional powers of land acquisition for  theService Departments is not so pressing as before.       As originally drafted there was a wordingwhich might have been taken to confer on the minister a power of conscripting or diluting labour  and  otherdrastic measures of that kind, but the wording  hasnow been changed, and there is now no suggestionthat such power can be exercised under the  section.       It is probable, however, that the question willbe raised as to whether the Minister is to  be  given any powers in regard to labour.  The answer seems  tobe that the Minister will be in close touch withthe Minister of Labour and his administration throughofficers of the Ministry attached to the Ministry  ofSupply.Clause 5.       This Clause provides all the power that mightbe needed to enable the Minister of Supply, if sodecided by the Government, to operate in supplymatters on behalf of all or any of the GovernmentDepartments which have powers in regard to  supply.
                                                     d3       Sub-Section (l) is based on Section .2 in-theMinistry of Munitions Act, 1915.       Sub-Section (2) is based on similar powerscontained in the Ministry of Health Act.  1919 andthe Ministry of Transport Act, 1919 as they are considered more suitable than the last words ofSection 2 (l) of the Ministry of Munitions Act, 1915.      Sub-Section (5) is to provide for the transferof powers relating to fertilisers of the Board ofTrade under the Essential Commodities ReservesAct, 1938, and. the sub-section is necessary in orderto relieve the Minister from the special accountingprescribed in the Act.  That provision is nowregarded as unnecessary.       Sub-Section (4) is formal.Clause 4.       This Clause provides a new power to theMinister to finance the accumulation in the handsof traders of stocks of articles of any kind whichmay be decided to be needed as national reserveswhether for military purposes or civil industryin time of emergency or war.  It supplements thepower in Clause 2 to buy such articles.       The power is to be exercised in accordance  with arrangements approved by the Treasury:  that is ausual provision where continuing commitments arebeing entered into, and where loan charges are being incurred.Clause 5.       Provides power to the Minister to obtain reports in regard to stocks in order that there may be adequate information available for the exercise ofthe powers in Clause 4.
                       .......... .......... - ......-&apos;     ,^-----  ;iJ-----.  .............._____:_______                                                   A -I       Sub-Section (l) provides that the Minister-may.require statements of stocks available and  as tofacilities for storing and utilising stocks.       Sub-Section .(2), gives power  to require reports as to the carrying out of works for the  publicservice and as to facilities available for carryingout such works.       Sub-Section (5) provides for the  Minister to utilise for the purpose of obtaining reports as tostocks, powers which are at present available toany other Government Department,       Sub-Section (4) provides a penalty for failure to comply with the Minister:&apos;srequirements0Clause 6-       This Clause provides for obtaining   the affirmative confirmation of Parliament for any transfer of powers under sections 2(2) and 3.Part II of the Bill.       The powers to be given by the Minister inregard to priority and obtaining costs have beendiscussed departmentally-and with the Prime Minister&apos;industrial Panel,  It has been decided to provide that the compulsory powers to be given in the Billregarding output and costs may be exercised for aperiod of 2 years in the first place, and thereafterby extension oh an address by both Houses ofParliament from year to year.  Any of the separatepowers may be extended without involving theextension of all.
Clause  7.        This Clause is the Clause under which theMinister may prescribe the priority of government orders  and may requisition output.   It is draftedon the  basis of progression to the more drastic powers as a remedy in cases whereother powers do not produce the results required.        Sub-Section (l).   This is the power, tobe exercised by the Minister on behalf of all government Departments, of specifying priority asbetween the orders of Government Departments, and ofGovernment orders as against the private orders inthe hands of contractors.   This is a new provision,although it is based on No.69 of the Draft defence regulations.   The Minister would have to exerciseauthority in agreement with other Departments, andif there were a clash of departmental interestsreference to a Cabinet Priority Committee would be needed.   The provision of power in this way avoidsthe need for other Bills to confer similar powers on other Departments, and emphasizes the necessity fordepartmental consultation.       Sub-Section (2) provides power to the Ministerto requisition output wherever the exercise of powers under Sub-Section (i) fails in its object,       Sub-Section (3) gives power to the Ministerto requisition output where a person who is in aposition to do so is unwilling to enter into a contract for supply.
                                                                    A *3                        Sub-Section (4)provides  a  protection  to the                 contractor of reasonable exercise of powers  given                 to the Minister.                        Sub-Section ( 5)  gives  the  Minister the very-                 drastic power of  taking control of the whole or                 part of a contractors works ia  the  event of failure to                 comply with directions  as to  production.   It is                 a new power and follows, to some  extent, No.69 of the                 Draft Defence Regulationso                        Sub-Section (6)  provides for fixing price in                 the event of failure to secure  agreement as  between                 the Minister and  persons supplying.  It is  drafted                 on the basis that the Minister  shall himself appoint a                 Panel of Arbitrators from whom  he shall select one                 or more arbitrators to  deal with  any particular case.                 There was provision under the Defence of the Realm                 Act Regulations in the  last war for the appointment                 by the Lord Chief Justice of  a  judge of the  High                 Court as arbitrator0    Exception  has since been taken                 to further work being  given to  judges in this manner                 and after very considerable discussion it has been                 considered that the most suitable persons to act as                 arbitrators might be prominent  industrialists.                        Sub-Section (7)  provides protection for any                 contractor who complies with  the  orders of the                 Minister in regard to  production,,  It should be                 definitely understood  that  no provision is included  in                 the Bill for compensation to  any  private person who                 suffers by reason of the enforcement of a priority                 and the consequent delay of a private contract.I
It- may, indeed, &quot;be that someone at the end of along line of contracts may be prejudiced by theaction of the Minister, particularly in respect of contracts to be executed abroad. - It is consideredthat -       (i)  as regards future contracts it should              be made clear in discussion of the Bill              that it is anticipated that contractors,              as a natural self-protection, will insert              a clause in private contracts, that              performance is subject to Government              rights as to priority.      (ii)  as regards current contracts, while the              protection given by the Bill may be              expected to deal adequately with the              majority of cases, the Minister will              probably find it necessary to express              the hope that the Clause will be              operated in very rare cases and with              great discretion.The Minister may, indeed, find it necessary to promise the most careful consideration in the operationof a number of sub-sections in this clause-.
      This clause is designed to secure  production of costs and in deference to representation made by the  Indust-rial panel, it has been worded in such a way as, first ofall, to secure the production of existing records, and,secondly, to give the Minister power where existingrecords are unsatisfactory,  to prescribe the records  whichshall be kept.  It provides, as a penalty for failure, a fine or the taking over of the business by a manager, butnot imprisonment.     Sub-Section (1)   is the power to require productionof costs records and to take copies of them.     Sub-Section (2)  is the power, if the records producedare unsatisfactory, to require other records to be kept,sufficient to enable a fair and reasonable price to bedetermined for production.     Sub-Section (5) is the sanction for failure.Clause 9.     This Clause provides the authority for persons appointedby the Minister to manage the whole or part of the businesswhere there has been default on the part of the owners ofthe business.Clause 10.This is a Clause providing protection for directors etc.who comply with an order of the Minister which may offendagainst the memorandum and articles of association or  a statute limiting or defining their functions.   It was theoriginal intention to include this among the  sanctions ofthe Bill, but  it is considered more satisfactory  to  includeit as a permission.Clause 11.     This  is&apos;  a Clause designed  to  stop  the  export of commodities notably  scrap metal  likely  to be  useful  to
 enemy countries or alternatively likely to  be needed here for production of war - supplies.   The  Industrial Panel are anxious that this power should he secured hut  the Board of Trade will probably wish to  make further, observa- tions regarding this provision.   As to form it should be noted that the Board of Trade exercise a restricted licensing power, though doubts have been expressed as to its Validity. Clause 12.        This is an entirely new Clause,  introduced  for the purpose of requiring Government  contractors to protect essential plant in their works.   The  provision made is in accordance with the decision of  the Committee of Imperial Defence reached on the  11th May  and provides, first, for the exercise of compulsory power requiring  contractors to carry out such measures as may be specified by the Minister,  second,  for a contribution  to cost which has been agreed with the  Treasury.   In addition to the contribution provided here there is to  be a further contribution from Contracting Departments based on the proportion of plant  taken up  by  Government  orders:  that is  within the existing  powers of Departments.  There is a penalty (of a fine) attaching  to  failure  to comply with  requirements  of  the  Minister.  The  Clause applies only  where  Government work is  in progress.       The  Industrial Panel are  strongly opposed to the financial  terms  proposed  by the  Government,  which  are, broadly,  a  contribution of  27-g- per  cent  of  cost under this  Clause  plus  contributions by contracting Departments over  two years  of  a proportion of the remaining 72-g- per cent.   equal   to  the proportion which Government workbears  to the total of the  contractors work.
       This is the clause already referred to, providing a limited period for the exercise of compulsory powers.The period fixed is two years with power to extend from year to year on an address to His Majesty by each house of Parliament.Clause 14.       This is formal.Clause 15.       Sub-Section (1.) provides for expenses of theMinister being paid out of voted monies. . Any-question of.repayment from the Service Departments to the ministry is a matter for discussion between Departments and forthe final administrative decision of the Treasury.The clause has been agreed with the Treasury.       Sub-Section (5) provides for the extension, as concerns Ministry of Supply requirements, of the Treasurypower to make loans under the-Defence Loans Act, 1937, in aid of Voted Monies.Clause 16.       The Clause provides penalties for wrongfuldisclosure of information obtained and is for theprotection of contractors and others required, under theBill,  to furnish information.Clause 17.       This Clause provides penalties for failure to complywith directions.   It will be noted that both fine andimprisonment are provided as penalties, though imprisonmentis not applicable to failure to furnish costs or failure to protect essential plant and factories.
       This Clause gives a wide definition to theexpression &quot;articles required for the public service&quot;which is used in the Bill.       (a) covers the ordinary requirement of all             Government Departments;       (b) and (c) together provide a very wide             interpretation and are intended to cover             all articles and materials likely to             be needed in emergency,  and also plant             etc, required to manufacture those             articles.

SECRET.  Ministry  of  Supply.           DRAFT             OF A       BILLTo establish, a Ministry of Supply and for purposes connected therewith.XLIX- C.  (8.)20th May 1939.136-7
              APPENDIX  III.  COPY OF LETTER PROM THE PRIME MINISTER1 S      ADVISORY PANEL OF INDUSTRIALISTS.                              3, Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.                                   18th May, 1939.Dear Sir Arthur,       The Panel have given very careful considerationto the Draft of the Ministry of Supply Bill.   We havehad the advantage of discussions with Mr.  Watson andSir John Stainton on the three Clauses of the draft which you first sent to us, namely, 2, 3 and 9, on which you particularly desired our opinion, and we have raised with them a number of points, some of which we consider to be, from the inaustrial point of view, of vitalimportance.       We are glad to learn that most of the suggestions which we made have been adopted and we understand thatyou now desire to have our opinion on the Bill as revisedat this date.       Our considered opinion is that in its present formthe Bill is well designed to achieve its immediate purpose,namely, the acceleration and co-ordination of supply inthe spheres over which the Minister may have control.   Insaying this, we do not ignore the fact that the clauses in Part II confer on the Minister extremely drasticpowers over industry - powers indeed, in our view, more drastic than should be exercised by any GovernmentDepartment in normal times.   Although, we believe thatsuch powers will be used only to the extent which theNational interests dictate, they undoubtedly make possiblean arbitrary interference with normal trade.
       We accept the view, however, that, the present.times are not normal and indeed constitute-from thepoint of view of supply, a period of emergency, and underthese conditions we agree that such powers ought to be available,,    That they are designed to meet an abnormaland temporary situation is recognised by the limitationsin Clause 15 put upon their continuance,       The directions which the Minister can issueunder Clause 9 may conceivably result in the impositionof penalties in respect of failure to deliver underexport contracts, but we understand that if such penaltiesin respect of contracts existing at the date of thepassing of this Bilj are in forces the Minister wouldhe prepared to regard this as one of the relevant considerations affecting the price of the supplies or works carried out under his directions.   We consider this of great importance,:       We do not agree, however, with Clause 14 and ourapproval of the Bill must be modified to this extent.Our opinion is that (a) if the Minister is to be givenpowers to compel firms to undertake extra-codeexpenditure for the purposes of protection in the eventof war, these powers should be extended to cover all such protection whether on the premises of essentialfirms or not;  (b) such expenditure should be paid for either by Government grant or in the manner suggestedin our Memorandum sent to the Secretary of State forAir on the 21st March *
       Clause 14 as it...stands-must,......in-aur--vi.ew.,. result ininequality of treatment, and that inequality will not be entirely removed but may indeed be emphasised if, as has beensuggested, the 27^%allowance is augmented by the Departmentsconcerned on their own authority to the extent of theproportion which Government work bears to the firrrr s total output.       We give three examples to illustrate this point, thewhole case being stated more fully in the Memorandum whichwe sent to the Secretary of State for Air on the 21st March.       (i)  A firm engaged 100% in Government work recovers              the whole cost either at once or eventually.      (ii)  A firm engaged to the extent of say 10% on              Government work may be required specially              to protect or camouflage the whole of its              premises because it has plant potentially              valuable for war purposes (and therefore to              be specially protected) or because it is a              landmark adjacent to a &quot;Shadow Factory7,  The              extra-code expenditure involved can be recovered              only to the extent of 27-g-^ plus 10% of 72^.     (iii)  The owners of factories not employed on Government              worK, but potentially valuable for such woric,              may yet have - to camouflage their premises under              this clause.  Only 274,-% of the extra-code              expenditure can be recovered in this case.       Firms in categories (ii) and (iii) cannot necessarilyrecover their extra costs by additions to price because their competitors may not have to incur this extra expense or because the firms are engaged in export trade.  Hence theinequality of treatment which, in view of the comparatively small number of firms concerned in relation to the importanceof the principle involved, is in our view, most unwise.       From the evidence we have had in the course of our examination of Supply problems, we have come to theconclusion that industry has given very real  proof of itsreadiness to co-operate with the Government but without such powers as are taken (for example, to enforce priorities),
ordinary trade commitments have prevenJ^e^&quot;tJae-productivecapacity of the country being utilised to the efullest extent.  We think it unliicely that cases of failure tocomply with the Minister&apos;s requirements will arise butwe cannot see good reason to object to the penaltiessuggested if there were such failure and the arbitrationClause should be a valuable reassurance to any who mayfear that the powers of the Minister to fix prices, ordeliver dates, might be exercised unreasonably or withoutfull appreciation of all the considerations which may affect particular trades concerned.       We believe that when times become more normal theco-ordination of supply, which a  Ministry of Supplycan secure without the exercise of the &quot;Emergency Powers&quot;in Part II already referred to, should tend to greater economy and efficiency.       For the reasons and on the assumptions statedherein, we approve of the Bill, subject always to the qualification that Clause 14 should be modified on thelines suggested.                   Yours sincerely,                         (Signed)  J.H.M. GRiiMLY.Sir Arthur Robinson, G.C.B., C.B.3.
