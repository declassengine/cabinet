Section 11 of the Military Training Act, 1939,          and Section 4 of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Act,          1939,  provide that His Majesty may by Order in Council          make provision for such consequential matters as it          appears  to him to be expedient to provide for by reason          of the passing of the Act.,  and may by any such Order          modify any enactment relating to such matters,.    The          draft  of such an Order is not to be submitted to His          Majesty  unless it has been approved by resolutions          passed by each House  of  Parliament,  save  that in the          event of a  dissolution or prorogation of  Parliament or          an adjournment of  each House  for  more  than  fourteen days,          an Order may  in case  of  urgent  necessity  be made without          first laying  a draft  before Parliament,   In  the  latter          case the Order will  cease to  have effect  twenty-eight          days after  the Commons House  first  sits after the  making of          the  Order unless within  that  period  resolutions  are passed.          approving the  making  of  the Order0
3.     Apart from measures for the requisitioning of premises, billeting, and similar arrangements, the principalmatters requiring consideration appear to fall into oneor other of the following classes:-       (i) the civilian liabilities of the man during             his period of training;  (paragraphs 8-16),      (ii) superannuation rights;  (paragraphs 17-18)..     (iii) the enactments that will require modification             by reason of the passing of the Military             Training Act;  (paragraph 19)-.      (iv) a number of miscellaneous matters for which             provision may have to be made by Order in             Council,  (paragraphs, 20-25)..3.     The Prime Minister decided that a ministerial committee should be set up to consider the issuesinsr-olved, composed as under: -       The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster                                  (Chairman),         The First Lord of the Admiralty,         The Secretary of State for War,         The Secretary of State for Air,         The Secretary of State for Scotland.         The President of the Board of Trade,         The Minister of Health,         The Minister of Labour,         The Financial Secretary to the Treasury..4*     A meeting of the Committee was accordingly held onThursday, 1st June, at which the Committee had beforethem a Memorandum prepared by the Ministry of Labour, coveringmeasures falling within (i),  (ii), (iii) and (iv) ofparagraph, 2 above, and agreed to submit to the Cabinet thefollowing Report dealing with the more important issues involved in these matters.5.     It is necessary to bear in mind that the greatmajority of militiamen will,  it may fairly be assumed,be solely dependent upon their pay and allowances(if any)  during their period of six months1 training.-                            -2-
 The  pay of the single man will &quot;be  10s. 6d. per week aad of the  married man 10s.6d.  per week for himself with allowances of 17/- per week for his wife, 5/- per week for  the first child,  3/- for the second child, 2/- for the  third  child and a 1/- for the  fourth  and any subsequent child.    There is also  provision for State assistance up to 17/- per week in  respect of other dependents where no payment is made  in respect of a wife.Sono  of these militiamen will have incurred civil liabilities before being called up for training and will find it very difficult, if not impossible, to dischargethose liabilities during their period of trainingor perhaps for some time thereafter.   (Whilst most ofthese men will be between 20 and 21 years of age, reserviste!called out for service under the Reserve and auxiliary forces Act will almost invariably be over 21. )6,     A summary of the methods adopted in the last war for dealing with the matters at issue will be found in theAppendix to this  Report..      These  included:-(a) the temporary suspension of certain liabilities;(b) the prohibition of the use of remedies for      enforcement of certain liabilities without      the leave of the court;  and(c) the granting of Exchequer assistance towards      certain obligations which men serving in any      of the armed forces were unable to meet      solely  by reason of their enlistment in *he      forces.
                                                       4 * :t                                                       J. .:. J70       For convenience,  this Report deals first withmen called up for training under the Military TrainingAct.   The position  of men called, up under the reserve and Auxiliary Forces Act is dealt with in paragraph 26.                CIVIL LIABILITIES.                     Rents. 8,       It is  suggested that notwithstanding theprovisions of any lease or agreement, a militiamancalled up for training should he empowered to determinehis tenancy on  giving not  less than 14 days1 notice to hislandlord, ,    Such notice should, however, he withoutprejudice to the landlord&apos;s rights under the  lease or agreement (ego as to dilapidations) other than his rightto rent  during  the remainder of the tenancy.   If theright to determine is not  exercised, there should be no interference with the landlord.&apos;s rights except that heshould, be prohibited (during the period of training or for six months thereafter;  from levying a distress orexecution or from exercising any right of re-entry orenforcing any judgment or  order of any Court except afterapplication to  and by leave of the Court?&apos;   Where theright to determine a tenancy is not exercised, theGovernment should contribute towards the rent (subject toproper safeguards) in cases in which hardship is shown.9,       Consideration was given to the question whetherthe procedure outlined in  the preceding paragraph,including provision for Government  ;ontrxbution towardsthe rent in cases of hardship,  should., be limited.to  rent obligations incurred  before a given date;The Order in Council should indicate the principlesupon which the  Court should, act in giving or withholdingleave in these  applications.,
                                                        14 O                                                         mas, for example, the date of the publication of the Orderin Council (say 15th June) or the date of the calling up ofthe first batch of men under the Military Training Act(1st July).   In favour of such limitation it can be argued that once the conditions of service of Militiamen, includingthe provisions of the proposed Order in Council, are made known, it should be possible for men to make their arrange-ments so as to avoid the continuance during their period oftraining of rental obligations which are beyond their own resources.10.  The general view of the Committee was, however, that the better plan would be that the proposed arrangements in regardto rent should apply for a period of, say, one or two years,in order not merely to cover obligations entered into priorto thtv passing of the Act, but also to give experience ofthe working of the scheme.   The Financial Secretary to theTreasury reserved the position of the Chancellor of theExchequer on this point, which was accordingly reserved for decision by the Cabinet.     It was also pointed out that accommodation is oftenscarce in neighbourhoods in which there are good opportunities for obtaining woric, and that many men would be seriouslyhampered in obtaining posts if they were unable to takepremises on such terms as were available.11.  The arrangements set out in paragraph 8 would, inpractice, won; as follows.   If a man, when called up fortraining in the Militia, has to maintain a home for a wife orwidowed mother and his rent is, say, 10/- a week, he would beexpected to contribute towards the rent out of his marriage allowance, which contains a rent element.   He could not,however, be expected so to provide the whole rent, and he would Joe. at liberty to  make application to a .
Hardship Tribunal which would determine in the light. of.his circumstances, including any--allo.wance payable tohim, what contribution towards his rental could properly be made.   No contribution would, of course, be made inthe case of a Militiaman who was not dependent on hisearnings.Mortgage interest and loans on house property.12.    Where mortgages and loans are secured on property which the militiaman himself or his dependants occupy, theinterest payable is in many respects analagous to rent.Subject to further consideration by the Treasury, theCommittee agreed provisionally to recommend that inthese cases there should be a restriction on the lender&apos;right to realise any.security or to enforce any judgment,during the period of training and for six months thereafter,without express leave of the Court.Other Civil Liabilities.13.    In the case of other obligations it was consideredthat the date at which they were entered into was relevant.    Those undertaken before notice of theobligation to undergo military training should be saved from execution without leave of the Court during theperiod of training and for six months thereafter.   Those,on the other hand, entered into when both parties can be presumed to have received notice of the requirements ofthe Military Training Act, should not be so saved.   Forthis purpose it was considered that the relevant datemight be 1st July /See paragraph 9/0
Hire Purchase -Agreements.14.     It  is proposed to  take power  to postpone payments under  hire purchase  agreements  concluded prior to 1st July,during the period  of training.   It  is a question,however, whether this time  limit should apply to articlesof household furniture.   The Board  of Trade and Ministryof Labour were  invited to arrange for informal consultationsto take place on this suggestion with persons who are engaged in the  Hire  Purchase business.Insurance premiums.,15.     There should  be no liability  to pay premiumsduring the period  of training, but the policy should other-wise remain in  full  forces, with power for the Companyissuing the policy  to deduct the unpaid premiums (withoutinterest) from  the amount secured by the policy whenever the policy becomes a claim.   This protection should, applyto all  policies taken out by the man (or his wife) whether on their own or on some other life.   The Board of Tradeundertook to consult with representatives of insurance companies on this matter.Payments due to a building  society.16.     There should  be no liability  to make any repaymentsto a building society  during a  period of training, and provision should be  made for the period of the loan to beextended by the period of training.    It is understoodthat the Building Societies will probably not object tothis course.                      SUPERARMJATIOH RIGHTS.17.    These rights,  arise from  both  statutory and non-statutory schemes,  some of which are on a contributory
basis and others not.   In almosfe all cases the rightto superannuation allowances will depend upon the previousservice having been continuous service and in many casesthe only service taken into account for superannuationpurposes will be service of a particular kind, e.g.  service in a particular grade or &quot;contributory&quot; service.    In thesecircumstances it would seem that some provision will haveto be made in the Order in Council to  deal with these considerations.18.     It is suggested that a period of training shouldcount as reckonable service in all cases, but that thereshould be no obligation on either employer *ir worker topay contributions in respect of such a period.   If con-trlbutions are not paid the loss should fall on theScheme and not on the individual and there should bepower to modify or adjust the scheme as may be foundnecessary by reason of the non-payment of these contribu-tions during the period of training.   Power should also be conferred upon the employer to pay contributionsduring the training period &quot;both for himself and for the worker.   Certain modifications of the relevantSuperannuation Acts will be necessary.       ENACTMENTS&quot;THAT WILL RBQJIRS MODIFICATION BY REASON       OF THE PASSING OF THE MILITARY TRAINING ACT.19.     The matters already referred to will necessarily involved the modification of the provisions of a number ofexisting enactments  (e. g. Hire Purchase Act 1958, the
various Superannuation Acts? the Rent Restriction Actsetc.) but there are also a number of other enactments relating to &quot;matters consequential&quot; on the passing of theMilitary Training Act which the Committee thought requiredmodification.    These include the following:-       (a) Births and Death?:   Registration Acts 1836             to 1929;       (b) Electricity Supply Acts 1882 to 1936;       (c) Holidays with Pay Act 1938;       (d) National Health Insurance Act 1936;       (e) Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory             Pensions Act 1936;       (f) Unemployment Insurance Act 1935;       The Committee did not, however, regard it as necessary to bring to the notice of the Cabinet thearrangements proposed in regard to these matters.
                                                 JL ho j.    MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS FOR WHICH PROVISION    MAY HAVE TO BE MADE BY ORDER-IN-COUNCIL.Holidays with Pay:  Apprentices and Learners.20.    The Committee v/ere informed that these matters were being discussed by various industrial organisations,and it was felt that, for the time being, it  was not necessary to make.any provision for these matters byOrder-in-Council.Agricultural Cottages.21.    The view of the Committee was that the cottage ofthe agricultural worker called up for military training should be reserved for the tise of his dependants during his period of training. -  In England, where rent is paidby the worker for his cottage, the provisions as to rent,set out in paragraph  8 would apply.   In Scotland, whereas a rule, no rent is paid, it was felt that, a cottage soreserved  should be paid for by the Militiaman at a rate to be fixed by the Agricultural Wages Committee.Teachers  and Students.22.    In some of the bursary and scholarship schemes,the tenure of the bursary or scholarship is limited to a specified period, and it was thought desirable not merely to empower but to make it obligatory on the EducationAuthority or other body administering the bursary toextend the period of  tenure if a student&apos;s course of studyis prolonged beyond the specified period as a result ofhis military training..Local Government Employees.23.    The Ministry of Health propose to instruct theLocal Authorities to  deal with the question whethercivil pay (or the difference between civil and military
pay) is to &quot;be granted to local government employees called up for training or service on the same basis as it hasbeen decided to adopt in regard to the Civil Service.This is that Reservists called up for service shouldreceive baXanoo jof. civil pop but the militiamen stiouldnot.       It will be necessary to empower the LocalAuthorities by Order-in-Council to make payments ofcivil pay or balance of civil pay to Reservists.Compensation for Death or Injury.24.    It has been pointed out that there are certainclasses of Government servants in respect of whom some payment would have been made as of right if the man haddied or been disabled while in the Government Service.it is represented that a claim is likely to be made thatsuch rights should, not be forfeited, if death or injuryoccurs while the man in question is undergoing militarytraining.  The same issue is likely to arise as regardsmembers of a Police Force who are called up to undergomilitary training.       The committee were informed that these issues werebeing discussed Departmentallyt and they recommend thatno specially favourable treatment should be given to thePolice in this connection.Bankruptcy.25.    The Board, of Trade consider that during their period of training militiamen should be protected fromproceedings in bankruptcy being taken against them.Provision should be made in the Order-in-Councilaccordingly.
KEN GALLED UP FOR SERVICE UNDER THE RESERVE AMD AUXILIARYFORGES ACT.36.    The matters dealt with in the preceding paragraphshave (except as regards paragraph 23) been discussed interras of their application to men called up for training under the military Training Act, i.e., Militiamen.  Itwas agreed that in principle the provisions recommended in these paragraphs should apply also to men called upfor service under the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Act,subject to modifications in detail where necessary.       Some doubt was expressed, however, whether it wasnecessary that the arrangements proposed in regard, forexample, to rents and civil liabilities, should beapplied to men called, up for a month&apos;s service only,on the ground that interference with normal arrangements was unnecessary for so short a periods  Departmentaldiscussions on this point are proceeding.CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS.27.    The Committee agreed to recommend thatConscientious Objectors under training should receivethe same treatment as Militiamen, in respect of thematters referred to in this Report.                         (Intld.)   W.S.M.richmond Terrace,  S.W.1,2nd June, 1939,
                    APPENDIX Q.    HOW CIVIL  LIABILITIES AND SUPERANNUATION RIGHTS          WERE DEALT WITH DURING  THE LAST WAR.                   Civil Liabilities.1..      At the outbreak  of war  It was found,  necessary  toprovide for a moratorium suspending temporarily&apos;the paymentof  Bills  of Exchange and pajmients  in pursuance of certain other  obligations.   This was  provided for  by the Postpone-ment of Payments Act, 1914,  which  authorised His Majestyby  Proclamation to authorise the postponement of any  paymentsreferred  to in that, Proclamation to such extent  and for such time and.  subject to such conditions or other provisions as might be  specified therein and to  vary, extend or revoke anysuch Proclamation.   A-number  of such Proclamations were&apos;made from time to time  varying the period of postponement andspecifying  that payments so postponed if not otherwisecarrying  interest, should, carry interest until payment atthe Bank  of England rate current at the outbreak of war.        These proclamations did not apply to:-        (a)  wages or salarsr;        (b)  rates or taxes;        (c)  any paj/ment  in respect  of any dividend, or              interest,  payable on  trustees  securities;        (d)  any payment  in pursuance of the  National             Health Act, 1911;        (e)  any payments under  the Workmen&apos;s Compensation             Act, 1906;        (f)  a  liability  which when  incurred  did not exceed              5 in amor:i.&apos;it.2.     At the same time further powers were given to  theCourts  in relation to the remedies for the  recovery ofmoney and other similar matters by the Courts (emergency powers) Act 1914.    This Act had effect during thecontinuance of the war and for a period of six months                      &quot;1&quot;
 thereafter and&apos;provided inter alia that after the passing of the Act:   (a) no person should proceed to execution or otherwise         enforce any judgement or Order of any Court for the         payment or recovery of sums of money to which the         Act applied except after application to and by         leave of the Court, or   (b) levy any distress, take, resume or enter into         possession of any property, exercise any right of        . re-entry, foreclose, or realise any security,         forfeit any deposit or enforce the lapse of any         policy or insurance to which the Act applied,         except after application to the Court and in         accordance with any Order ma.de by that Court.       The Act did not apply to any sum of money (other than rent not being rent at or exceeding  50 per annum) due under a contract made after the outbreak of war - and, so far as policies of&apos;insurance were concerned, it applied to life or endowment policies for an amount not exceeding  25, the premiums in respect of which were passable at not longer than monthly intervals and had been paid for at least two years preceding the outbreak of war. 3.     Provision was also made under this Act whereby if abankruptcy petition had been presented against a debtor and he proved to the satisfaction of the Court that his inability to pay his debts was due directly or indirectly to the war,  the Court could, in its discretion, stay theproceedings under the petition for such time and subject to such conditions as the Court thought fit.4.     In Scotland, the Law Agents Apprenticeship (War Service) (Scotland)  Act, 1914,  enabled apprentices to Law Agents inScotland to reckon one half of the period of their service in any of the Naval and Military Forces of the Crown duringthe war as actual  service under an indenture of apprentiship.
5.In England tlie Solicitors (Articled Clerks)  Act,  1918.provided that service in any of II. h&apos;.  Forces, or in any publicservice connected with the war, shall be reckoned for all purposes as time duly served under Articles ef Clerkship.constituted as a separate sub --department, was set up in 1916to grant assistance to non-regular other ranks to meetfinancial obligations which.they were unable to meetthemselves, solely by reason of their enlistment in the forces.The scheme was afterwards extended to apply to non-regular officers.No grants were made in respect of the ordinary cost of subsistence of dependants, nor for the purpose of payingordinary tradesmen&apos;e bills or private debts.   The liabilitiesmet by the Commissioners were -      including mortgages, but not loans raised to meet      debts;(c) instalments for the purchase of a house or -      business premises:(d) taxes:(e) rates;(f) insurance premiums;  andC S) schoo1 fees.The maximum assistance in any individual case was  104 ayear.       The grants could not continue after a member of the forehad ceased to serve nor after his decease, and the original scheme came to an end in July; 1920.       In 1919 the sub-department waa transferred to theMinistry of Labour and took over responsibility for settlementgrants..-   They continued for a time to meet certaincontractual obligations on the liner, of the original scheme,but in addition wore empowered to make lump sum grants to6.A Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee, later(a)(b)rent of dwelling bouses or business premises;interestand instalments payable in respect of loans
enable- demobilized officers and men to purc^ase^jatocjfc,^fjLtt-Uigs,tools etc., to establish them in business or trade.    The.-.maximumrlump sum grant was  104 0       The &quot;continuing&quot; grants could not be made for a periodbeyond one year from the date of demobilization, etc., and themaximum rate was  104 a year,   The maximum lump sum grant was 104, but continuing grants for resettlement plus the lump sumgrant could not exceed  104.                       Superannuation.7.     In August 1914 the Elementary School Teachers (War Service)Superannuation Act 1914 was passed to enable certificatedteachers to reckon service in connection with the war as &quot;recorded&quot;service for the purpose of the Acts relating to elementary schoolteachers&apos; superannuation.   Section- I of that Act provided that service by a certificated teacher in any of the Naval or MilitaryForces of the Grown might be regarded for the purpose of the elementary School Teachers&apos; Superannuation Acts 1898-1912 in the.same manner as and as equivalent to service in  the capacity of acertificated teacher in a public elementary school.8.     A similar Act, namely, Education (Scotland) (War Service)Superannuation Act 1914, was also passed to authorise an amendment of the Superannuation Scheme for teachers in scotland for the purpose of enabling service in connection with the war tobe reckoned as recorded service under the Scheme.9.     In September 1914 the Irish Police Constables  (Naval andMilitary Service) Act 1914 was passed to make provision withrespect to constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary and the dublin Metropolitan Police v/ho were Reservists, or joined theNaval or Military Forces.   Section I of that Act provided that where a constable of the R.I.C. or D.M.P. had inpursuance of a Royal Proclamation been called into actualservice as a member of any Royal Naval Reserve Force or
been called out for permanent service as a member of the army reserve, on his return to the Police Force his subsequent pay in that force and any pension, allowance or gratuity granted after his return to him or his dependants might, if the Lord Lieutenant sodirected, be calculated in like manner as if his service under the proclamation had been service in the Police Force.10.    In August 1914 the Police Reservists (Allowances) Act, 1914,which was amended by the Police Constables (Naval and MilitaryService) Act 1914, was passed to authorise the grant out of Policefunds of certain allowances and gratuities in respect of PoliceReservists who were called out upon permanent service.  This Act,provided that where a constable of the Police Force had been called out for service during war or any-emergency the Police authority might, if they thought fit, grant out of the Police Fund to, or forthe benefit of, his wife and children or any of them, or in the caseof an unmarried man to, or for the benefit, of any person whom hewas legally liable to maintain or towards whose support he hadregularly contributed an allowance of such amount and subject tosuch conditions and restrictions as they thought equitable.       These Acts also provide that if the man died or was disabledwhilst employed on Naval or Military Service, the Police authority should have power to grant to his widow and children or to himcertain pensions and allowances.11.    In November 1918 the Police (Pensions) Act 1918 was passed to make further provision with respect to pensions payable to police constables and their widows.  Section I of that Act provided(inter alia) that where a man to whom that Section applied diedwhilst serving in a Police Force or in any of Kis Majesty&apos;s Naval,Military or Air Forces, for the purpose of the war the police authority should grant to his widow a pension as therein stated.       In the case of civil  Servants, service in the forces during the last war was allowed to count towards pension.
