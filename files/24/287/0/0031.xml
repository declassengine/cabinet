THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.THE GERMAN FINANCIAL EFFORT FOR  REARMAMENT.                  Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    I  CIRCULATE for the information  of  my colleagues a  memorandum prepared in the Treasury on the German financial effort for rearmament.                                                   (Initialled)       J. S.    Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,         July 3, 1939.                             I. Introductory.    THE main part of this note consists of an analysis of the present financialeffort of Germany as compared with that of this country.   . 2.   As, however, the question is often asked  in  general  terms why  thiscountry cannot at all times do what Germany does, it may be well to make one ortwo general observations on that subject.    3.   The present regime  in Germany started in a period of great depressionwith quite a small national debt, and was in a position to use inflationary methodson a very large  scale while  merely taking up the slack in employment.    Thecountry is  now fully  employed and as much of their  borrowing has been  andremains inflationary, they may be approaching the end of these resources and theadvantage in this one respect may lie in future on our side.    4.   The population is docile and ready to accept  regulation.   A completesystem of regimentation has been gradually built up with typical German industryuntil it permeates the whole economic machine.  The system is said to be basedon discipline, but this discipline is enforced by the power of the party agents and by the  fear of the concentration camp.    5.   Germany can and doe^ impose upon the masses of the people much heaviertaxation than has been attempted in this country.    6.   As Germany  cannot expect in war to import from overseas, the policy has been to acquire great stocks  of imported  necessities, to produce at homesubstitutes for particular types of essential  imports, though  involving great      [195171                     &apos; &apos;           &quot;          &apos;           B
economic waste, and to acquire power over adjacent territories which can supplyGerman needs.  The question of the means of payment for overseas imports inwar an ever present anxiety in our case-scarcely arises  in Germany.    &quot;Wecannot be self-supporting even if we wish to.     II. Note on the present financial effort of Germany and this country.    1.  If not quite hopeless it would be an extremely difficult task to set out ihany clear way the comparison between the financial effort made by Germany  andthat of this country.  We should not really be comparing like with like, since there are profound differences between the economic systems of the two countries.The  German economic system is determined by her internal political and socialsystem, which is entirely &quot;different from ours:    2.  Apart from this a  great deal of  the statistics necessary to  make  a comparison are not published in Germany, and so far as figures do get published in that country their propaganda aspect  has no  doubt  been well considered inadvance.    3.  A  third type of difficulty lies in the fact that the two currencies are not comparable.  Sterling is only one value, whereas the different kinds of marks have all sorts of values.  It is open to any writer who chooses to convert marks to   at the  official  rate of  11-9 to the  .  Another author might choose 20 to the  ,and get all his figures different by nearly 70 per cent.    To estimate the equivalent of marks in  sterling  for the purpose of  thismemorandum we have the following index numbers of hourly wages : *                                                 1929.       Dec. 1938.        Great Britain (100 in 1924)......      98 -1        103-9        Germany  (100 in 1928)      ...     ...     105-5         84-1    On the basis of  100 in  1929, the index numbers for December 1938 would therefore be for Great Britain 105-9 and for Germany 79-7. The German  isto the British as 75-2 to 100.  If the  gold parity of 20-43 marks corresponded tomonetary equilibrium in 1929, the appropriate figure now would be 15- 36 marks.Alternative comparisons based on the movement of prices since 1929 would givehigher figures.  Such matters as the change in our fiscal system since 1929 tend to disturb all  comparisons, and on the whole it is thought a fair rate for comparingincomes or  taxes in the two countries would be 16 marks to  1.  There is no  realcertainty about the figure, but we do not know how to improve on it.    4.  As regards unofficial estimates of the position in Germany, the trouble is that there are so many of them and that they reach such conflicting results.    5.  Dealing with the matter in general terms, the position would appear tobe as follows : 1    There  can be no doubt that Germany has been spending absolutely  a largersum  and is still spending an absolutely larger sum on armaments than we  are.This is what  one would expect in view of the vastly greater size of her army.The  fact that Germany has more money to spend so far must be due to one ormore of the following causes :     (a) she raises  more by taxation;    (b) she spends less on civil government, leaving, therefore, a larger balance           available  for defence;    (c) she borrows more for defence purposes.No doubt all these things have been true in the past, but, broadly speaking, theTreasury would be inclined as regards the present to attach little importance tothe last two items  and a great deal to the first.    6.  Assuming, indeed,  that we succeed in  carrying  out the borrowingprogramme contemplated for this year, including that required to  meet supple-mentary estimates, it  may  well be  that  on the. point-of&apos;  borrowing  we shallbe running ahead of Germany.  As regards the cost of civil government, it mustbe borne in mind that with roughly the same kind of  total national incomethe  German  population   is  to  ours  as  about  5  to   3.   She  is  notbarren  Of  social  services,  of  &quot;which,  indeed,  she was largely  the  pioneer,but   they   are  run   on   more   economical  lines   than   our   own,   and
in particular a much larger proportion of the cost is fixed on the beneficiaries.German administration has by no means got the reputation for economy and theauthoritarian nature of the Government rather implies an expensive administra-tion.  Thus, while no doubt German civil government may be cheaper than oursper head,  it is prima facie unlikely that in total it could be much cheaper,  except as regards debt charges, where  after six years  of most  lavish borrowing theannual charge cannot yet be much over  100 millions a year.    7.  This would leave the difference in the product of taxation as the  sole ormain factor explaining the ability of Germany to spend larger sums on armamentsthan we do.  There qan be no doubt whatever, since the information comes fromall quarters, that in fact German taxation is higher than ours in many respects.They  have, for instance, a 40 per cent, tax on the profits of companies on top ofthe ordinary income  tax.   Important also  is  the greater  power they have of enforcing taxation in the form of a subservient judiciary and the cruder methodsof the concentration camp for offenders.    8.  In comparing the yield of taxation in the two countries, however, thereis this to be borne in mind :  Germany is really in this sphere, as  in others,  a year or so  ahead of us.  She has already  achieved the almost  complete  abolition ofunemployment, whereas we are still a long way from that state of affairs.  Inother  words, while the yield of the taxation system in Germany may be reachingits peak, it is certain that ours will not reach its peak for another year.    9.  If it be asked what price Germany has paid for her success  in this field,the answer is to be found in three or four directions.      (i) The standard of living  is much lower in Germany; as compared  with           1929 German wage rates  appear to be down by some 20 per cent.,           whereas in our  case wage  rates are up by 6 per cent, since the same           date.  That is not to say that the  Nazis have actually reduced wage           rates, a statement which it would  certainly be impossible to  prove.           The fact is that they seized power at a time of deep  depression after           wage rates had been brought very  low, and they have prevented any           considerable recovery  in those rates.  The destruction of the Trade           Union machinery for  securing wage increases would probably  have           been  effective by  itself, even  without  the direct State regulation of           wages.                                                  -)     (ii) The cost of  living in Germany has nominally  fallen, but there has           undoubtedly been a fall in  real wages, and the tax burden  on the           working classes  is now extremely  heavy.  Likewise  the  standard of           living of  the middle and upper classes  has been greatly depressed by           the extreme weight of taxation.    (iii) In order to  secure more money for defence other parts of  the German           economy, e.g., the railways, have been allowed to run down  considerably           in efficiency owing to their inability to obtain  funds  for  maintaining           their equipment properly.  A similar state of things has not occurred           yet in this country.    10.  There is also, of  course, the question how long  Germany can continueto devote  so  much energy  to armaments.  Down  to  the  time of  Dr. Schachfsdisappearance Germany was pursuing a general economic policy which, in certain respects, could be qualified as rather conservative.  This appears no  longer to be true.  The recently published devices for paying  for Government purchases in paper carrying taxation privileges in future  years suggests an attempt  to eattheir corn while it is green, but it is  not clear that this is  yet on a scale whichwould result in marked difficulties in raising taxes  later on.    11.  The above is the broad picture.  So far as it is possible to clothe it inthe form of statistics the attempt is made in the paragraphs  which follow.,   12. &apos; There are two major difficulties in  giving  actual figures,  viz.,  (a) nodetailed figures for State expenditure, whether  on armaments or for civil purposeshave been published for several years, (&amp;) only very incomplete figures for Stateborrowing are available.                               1  ; -    13.  In .1938-39 the Reich  received tax revenue of  17,691 million  RM.( 1,106 millions) of which 2,000 million RM. ( 125 millions) was  passed on to theStates. 1 State and local taxation amounted to 4,900 million RM.  ( 306 millions).      [19517]&quot;&apos;&apos;                                                   B 2
Total  taxation, Reich,  State  and local  was  thus nearly 22,600 million RM.*( 1,412 millions).                                  ,   ,          -   : The expenditure by the States and local authorities  was 6,900 million RM.( 431 millions).&apos;  What was the civil expenditure by the Reich, in addition to the2,000 million RM. granted to the States %  We only know that the correspondingitems for 1934 amounted to 5,590 million RM. ( 349 millions).  We do nOt knowhow that figure may have  varied; except that  (1) the debt charge,  which was500 million RM.  in 1934,  must surely have risen to 1,500 million  RM., and(2) Austrian  Civil  expenditure has to be included;  Perhaps the  Reich civil expenditure in 1938-39  was 7,500 million RM. ( 469 millions). Then total civil expenditure (Reich, States, local) was  14,400t million RM. ( 900 millions).    14.   But we have  also  to  allow .for the fact that the contributions  to theUnemployment Insurance were  1,600 million RM. ( 100 millions) in excess ofthe cost of unemployment relief.  Such  a surplus may appear later on in the formof Statedebt, but it is debt which does-not have to be borrowed.    15.   The amount available  for defence from  borrowing is entirely obscure.Balogh, basing himself on results to October, considers that it may have reached11,000 million RM. for the year ( 688 millions).  But some unknown part of this must  have been borrowed for State financed investment (including  partly thefour year plan investments), roads, canals, public  buildings, &amp;c.    The  increase  in the  disclosed internal debt in  the  year 1938-39 was11,813  million  RM.   ( 738   millions),  of   which  long  term   debt was,623 million RM.  ( 477 millions).  But we do  not know how much of the longterm debt was new money and how much was funding of short term debt previouslyissued, the &quot; secret debt.&quot;  The Germans decided at the beginning of 1938 to issueno more &quot; special &quot;  bills. One would, naturally, presume that in such  conditionsa good deal of the new long term debt was for funding, i.e., for providing moneyto pay off bills as they matured.  Now the statistics of bills of  all classes held by german  banks show no decline but an increase of 5,400 million RM. betweenMarch 1938 and March 1939.   A very considerable volume of special bills was,however,  held outside the Banking system,  and there is nothing to  show these were not  redeemed out of long term borrowing.    On  the  whole  the  amount spent on  defence out  of borrowed  money  byGermany in 1938-39 is  quite obscure.  One is inclined to regard  600 millions(at 16 RM. to the  ) as the maximum.  It  may be a  great deal lower.  To call the figure  500 millions (i  100 millions) would allow for some funding andalso for some of the borrowing having been for non-defence purposes, but it is allquite speculative.    16.   We  can now  compare the German figures for  1938-39 with, say, ourown Defence  arrangements for 1939-40 :                                               United  Kingdom.   Germany.                                               As proposed    As guessed for                                                 1939-40.       1938-39.                                                    m.       m. ( =  16 RM.).         Revenue (national plus local)      ...       1,152        1,413         Profit  on  Unemployment  Insurance        ...           100  ,       Civil  Expenditure  (national  plus             local)     ...     .........         905         900Available from Budget for defence        247           613Borrowed for Defence     ......        400^:         1500 (i  100)                                                    647J      ? 1,113 (i 100)   &apos; :17.  The figure for the yield of national revenue is the best attested of the lot, and if  there  is an error  in  the local&apos; revenue  it would be balanced by acorresponding error in local expenditure.  The figures seem to show that we are &quot;.&quot;..*. cf. Balogh, International Affairs, March 1939, p, 232.  He gives 22,000 million.RM.   f Balogh seems  to make the civil expenditure in  1932 10,200  million RM., after allowing for say 1,000  million RM. spent On defence in that year.  He carries  this figure forward andmakes an allowance  in the end of  2,000 to 4,000 million RM. for possible increases of local expenditure.and also for Reich  borrowing for.civil purposes.   He.does not refer/specifically todebt charges, or Austria.  Generally his figures seem far too low.   $ Thesse figures include a margin for supplementary estimates, but a preliminary examina-tion of the&apos; supplementaries threatened this July indicate a further great increase.
raising this -year, say,  260: millions less than Germany raised last year.  even so, as we have included our miscellaneous revenue while the German figures are for tax yield, the. comparison is too favourable to us.  The Nazi leaders have boastedof a further large rise in the yield of taxation this year sec paragraph 19 below.    As  regards the second item of profit.on unemployment insurance, we  have nothing of the sort at present.   Eater on we  may have.   For example, if theunemployed fell to 1,000,000,  the  Unemployment  Fund  might  have,  say, 30 millions a  year more to invest.;    The figure for German civil expenditure is more doubtful than  that  oftaxation.  If the  900 million figure is in error it is below the truth.  It seems unlikely to the  Treasury that the true figure could be above  1,000 millions.    The guess-work nature of  the  figure  for  German borrowing has  been sufficiently brought out in paragraph 15 above.    18.   Nothing more can be claimed for the figures  than that they confirm thegeneral impression that at the present time it is the heavier taxation in germany which  is the  important factor in enabling her to  finance  a bigger  defence programme.    19.   It will be noticed that the above comparison is between the  UnitedKingdom  (1939/40) and Germany (1938/39). -  There  are no  available estimates for Germany (1939/40)  except as regards Reich taxation.  A Press  report of a recent speech by Herr Reinhardt runs as follows :                              &quot; Cost of Rearmament. .       In a speech to business men in Berlin to-day  Herr Reinhardt, the State    Secretary at the Ministry of Finance, implicitly replied to criticisms of the    taxation system.                                                  .s        Herr  Reinhardt said that the historic  achievements of  the  Fuhrer,    especially  rearmament, and the &apos; Repatriation &apos; of Germans in  Austria, the    Sudetenland, Bohemia, and Memel, had made even greater demands on Reich    finances  than the  preceding abolition of  unemployment.:  Moreover, the    securing and development of the  vital rights of the Great  German Reich    were  only  possible  with strong armed  forces.  It  had been said that the    rearmament should have been spread over a greater  number of  years.  &apos; I    believe that only a  fool or an absolute enemy of the Reich would make this    assertion.&apos;   Admittedly, the  cost of rearmament  would then have been less    and the cost of the western fortifications would not have arisen at all;  On    the other hand, in all probability Germany would have had forced upon her    last year a war which would have cost many times as much.         In answer to the question frequently asked, &apos; Where is all the money    coming from? &apos; Herr  Reinhardt  pointed  to the  &apos; Constantly  increasing    financial   strength  of  the  Reich.&apos;   Taxation  revenue  had   risen  from    6,600,000,000 marks in 1932 to 17,700,000,000 m. in  1938 :  in  the  current    financial year it would probably rise to 22,000,000,000 m., and  it would be    even higher in 1940.  Five hundred million marks  were obtained up to March    of this year from the levy on Jewish fortunes.         The method previously followed of financing  the State&apos;s needs by short-  ; or medium-term loans, which were afterwards converted into long-term loans,    represented a charge on future tax revenue because the service and redemp-    tion of the debt had to be met from  taxation. Many milliards more could    have been raised by loan, but the financial and political principle of National    Socialism demanded other ways of financing deficits; also it was not desired    to close the capital market to private industry.         In principle that part of the extraordinary expenditure of the Reich    which could not be met from taxation  would in  future, be covered only by    the issue of interest-bearing tax  certificates.  The tax  certificates did not    represent  a further increase of the interest burden of the Reich but, only a     &apos; shifting &apos; of taxes which the Reich Budget was  quite able to bear.  As far     as couldbe seen, the rising revenues of the Reich would  render  unnecessary     in 1940 the issue of interest-bearing tax certificates on the same scale  as in     1939.&quot;              ,             ,     Herr Reinhardt could only be giving estimates based on the experience of two or  three months of the new financial  year... But  if. indeed,  the  yield of taxation for the Reich  alone - in 1939-40 will be 22 milliards,  an increase of
4-3 milliards ( 269 millions) over 1938-39, the implications are staggering.  Itis not so much that it gives them more  to. spend on  armaments, because, as isobvious  and as Reinhardt says, their borrowing must be coming down.  But it means that they have over  880 millions a year for defence without borrowingagainst  our   247 millions, and unless their Budget breaks down they  can keep it up indefinitely.   If the calculations are   100 millions or even  200 millionswrong an enormous disparity still remains between the United  Kingdom and theGerman figures.    20.   The  following  is  an analysis  of  German tax revenue for  the year1938-39 :-        Income tax -                                   Millions of  Marks.

We may compare the whole British income tax and surtax with theGerman tax on incomes other than wages.  The German tax on wages, togetherwith the turnover tax, customs and taxes on consumption, may then be comparedwith our indirect taxes.   The following comparison results :-Germany (1938-39).

Unfortunately, there is no reliable estimate of the british national income for comparison; perhaps it is  4,500 millions.  The preliminaryestimate of the German national income for 1938 is 77 milliards.  With Austriathe total is likely to be well above 80 milliards ( 5,000 millions).    21.  The  most striking results  of the above comparison of  tax yields are(1) the very heavy burden on  the  working classes in Germany, (2) the  heavyGerman corporation tax (40 per cent, of company profits), and (3) the relativelymodest yield of income tax and  other direct taxes.    The turnover  tax, it  is true, falls not only on the working  classes, but onall incomes. But the same applies to customs and excise duties in both countries,and the income tax on wages in  Germany is more definitely a working class impostthan the indirect taxes in Great Britain.   Local taxation in Germany has been estimated  at  5 milliards (nearly   300  millions), and compares with  about 210 millions  in Great Britain.  Contributions from employers and employed for
health and unemployment insurance, &amp;c, amount  in Germany  to no less than5,273 milliards,  or   330 millions  (twelve months  to June 1938).   For  GreatBritain in 1936 they were only  110 millions, and are probably still under  120millions.                          111.  - German Imports.    22.  The Treasury were asked for a note about the recent increase in Germanimports as shown by  the tables  compiled by  Sir George Schuster and  recently published in the &quot; Economist.&quot;    These tables were tables of volume, and the increase is largely explained bythe lower cost of food and raw materials.    The following  table shows  the imports in certain years in millions ofmarks : 		Raw materials		Total	and half-finished	Food and	Imports.	goods.	drink.1913 .....	10,770	6,280	2,8081929 .....	13,447	7,205	3,8231933	4,204	2,420	1,0821937 .....	5,468	3,295	1,4851938 .....	5,398	2,890	1,998    Imports of raw materials and half-finished goods fell from over 7,000 million marks  in  1929 to  under 3,000  million marks in  1938.  The world gold price index for 1938 is  45-4  per  cent, of  that for 1929.   If  that can be applied to german imports the 2,890 millions of marks of  1938 would  buy as much as6,360 millions  in 1929.Treasury Chambers,  S.W. 1,     July 3, 1939.
