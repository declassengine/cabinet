(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. 127(39)CAB I N E TcCopy No    MINISTRY OF INFORMATION0Memorandum by the, Home Secretary..lo   With the approval of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, I submit to my colleagues a proposal for an immediate announcement of the Governments policy with regard to publicitymeasures, both in peace and war02.   By the desire of the Prime Minister, a Ministerial committee consisting of the Foreign Secretary, the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence, and myself has been engaged for some weeks past in considering what steps should be taken during peace to counteractanti-British propaganda and to institute a more active policy ofBritish publicity overseaso3(With this object in view, it is proposed, with the approvalof the Chancellor of the Exchequer: -     (i)  to strengthen and expand the News Department of the          Foreign Office t:f the addition of staff whose duty          it will be to watch foreign press and broadcasts,          to supply material for telegrams and articles, and          to prepare (or cause to be written by outside experts)          press articles presenting the antidote to anti-British          propaganda, and    (ii)  to explore and give effect to other means of giving          publicity abroad to the British case and attitude          through all the channels available04.   For these purposes it will be necessary to ask parliament in July to vote additional, funds in the form of supplementary estimates for the Foreign Office and for Diplomatic and consular services, both for the extra staff required and for the consequential operational expenseso    We must, of course, beready then to give a full explanation of our policyo50   As regards&apos; publicity in time of war, my colleagues, are aware that plans are being made for the organisation of a
Ministry of Information to be brought into being in a time ofcrisis, if the Government of the day should so decide.    Thesmall body of Civil Servants and others who have been engaged on these plans have found themselves seriously hampered hithertoby two factors - first, the obligation of secrecy;  and secondly,the lack of funds.     No money has been voted by Parliamentexpressly for this work, and, with the exception of a smallappropriation from Secret Service funds, and such incidentalexpenses as can legitimately be charged to existing Votes, nomoney  is at present available.    Since the Prime minister asked  me, a few weeks  ago, to undertake a general responsibilityfor these matters, I have given careful consideration to thisquestion, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary  and theChancellor of  the Exchequer, and have reached the conclusionthat,  if the Ministry  is to be made ready to function at anoptimum efficiency immediately on the outbreak  of war,  it isessential that those who are responsible for its planning shouldbe provided with  the funds necessary for their  task.    I am satisfied that the Secret Service Vote  is not the proper  sourcefrom which these  funds should be drawn.    The  proper course in the circumstances is that Parliament should  be  asked openlyto vote the necessary  supply by means of a Supplementary  estimate for the Home Office, as the parent Department of the  Ministry.I understand that the  Chancellor of the Exchequer  concurs inthis view.6.   This, of  course,  means  the abandonment  of  the  present policyof secrecy, and the full disclosure of  our intentions toParliament and the public.    Before recommending this  course to the Cabinet I  wished to  satisfy myself  that  the  opposition would  not use  the occasion  to accuse the Government of  scheming
                                                         0 fin this way to interfere with the freedom of the Press in time of peace.    I accordingly sounded the Leader of the Opposition.,and I hope to he in a position, when this paper comes up forconsideration, to assure my colleagues that there will he no serious criticism of this kind in Parliament.7.   Apart from such criticisms, it may he said that theannouncement will he badly received in Germany as a fresh proof of British hostility and determination to press forward with an1encirclemerct1 policy.   In my view, this objection is clearlyoutweighed by the arguments in favour of publication.    Further,it is notorious that the propaganda Ministry in Germany isspending annually vast sums on presenting the German case and on anti-British propagandaQ8.   Y/e must in any case make an announcement shortly withregard to our overseas publicity measures, and it is clearly desirable that in doing so we should cover the whole ground ofpolicy.    While public opinion undoubtedly assumes that aMinistry of Information will be created in time of war, thereis general uncertainty about our state of preparedness, which certain publicists are using as a stick to beat the Governmentwith.   I believe that both the press and the public will be greatly reassured and heartened by a full statement of our intentions.9.   I should still, however, have hesitated to recommend anannouncement as long as we were unable to state that we had succeeded in finding the right man as Director-General Designate.I am glad to say that this objection is. now removed.   LordPerth has been good enough to be at our disposal for thispurpose until the work of planning is completed, which I hopemay be by the end of December and in any case not later  than the
end of March next.I am confident that the appointment of so distinguished a public servant will be well received.10.  The overseas publicity work of the Foreign Office andthe staff engaged thereon will be taken over by the ministry should be found to ensure continuity between the peace-timeactivities of the Foreign Office in relation to publicity abroad and the work that will in war fall upon the Ministry of director General Designate of the Ministry should make himselffully acquainted with the peace-time activities of the ForeignOffice, and, with this object, the Foreign Secretary, with myapproval, has asked Lord Perth, and the latter has agreed, toundertake a general supervision over the main lines of policy in regard to the overseas publicity work in the Foreign Office.11.  Lord Perth will be obliged, under his doctor&apos;s orders,to take a short leave of absence between the 9th and 19th June.It is desirable that the announcement should be postponed untilthe week before his return.    I recommend, therefore, that astatement be made in Parliament by the Prime Minister on or about 12th June in terms of the attached draft, which has beenapproved by the Foreign Secretary.in the event of war.It is, therefore, important that meansInformation.For this purpose it is desirable that theS .H.2nd June, 1939.
                  SUGGESTED REDRAFT.   DRAFT parliament AMEN TAR Y QUESTION AM), ANSWER OR PUBLICITY.Question;   To ask the Prime Minister whether he is in a            position to make any statement on the            Governments general policy with regard to            publicity measures in peace and in the event            of war^Answer;     Yes, Sir,   His Majesty&apos;s Government have recently had under review the question of publicity measures both inpeace-time and in the event of war.            As the result of this review they have reachedthe decision, in respect of peace-time measures, that it isnecessary to embark forthwith upon a more active policy of publicity overseas, partly in order to counteract misleadingstatements from other sources and, more generally, in orderto present to the world the British point of view in a more complete form than hitherto.   Much has been done already inthis direction through the valuable work of the british council, the B.b., and. the News Department of the ForeignOffice, but we are satisfied that it is now necessary toincrease out activities in this field under the general control of the Foreign &quot;Secretary,   Plans to this end aretherefore being worked out and supplementary estimates willbe presented to Parliament next month, first for the ForeignOffice, to cover the cost of additional staff at headquarters, and secondly for Diplomatic and consular services, to cover operational costs.   I am glad to say thata distinguished public servant - Lord Perth - has acceptedan invitiation from the Foreign Secretary to undertake ageneral supervision, under that Secretary of State, of thepeace-time overseas publicity work of the Foreign Office.            With regard to  the measures to be adopted inthe event of war, the position will depend upon the nature of
the war,but, in the case of a major conflict, theGovernment&apos;s intention is that a Ministry of information with a Cabinet Minister and a Director-General of equivalentstatus to that of a permanent head of a public Departmentof the first rank should be set up at once.   The dutiesof the Ministry would be to ensure the supply of officialnews to the public, to prevent the publication of matterprejudicial to the national interest and to present thenational case to the public both at home and abroadtruthfully and by all available means,,   These dutiescan only be carried ot.t with the co-operation of the press and other publicity agencies of this country, and Governmentare confident that they can rely on a continuance of theloyal support they have always received from them.Considerable progress has already been made in the plans for the establishment of such an organisation, should theneed arise.   I have asked  my Right Hon. Friend, theSecretary of State for Home Affairs, to undertake a general responsibility In regard to this matter and, in particular,&apos;for the completion of the preliminary arrangements for theMinistry.    In a supplementary estimate for the Home Office,which will be presented next month, Parliament will be askedto provide the necessary funds for the planning of theMinistry and for such equipment as it may be found necessaryto provide at this stage.       In the event of a war which involves the creationof a Ministry of Information,  the publicity functions atpresent performed by the Foreign Office, together with thestaff at present engaged upon them, will be taken over bythe Ministry of Information,   In order to ensure the close&apos;co-ordination which is desirable at this stage my Noble Friend^
to (*bothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, has,  with theapproval of my right hon,  Friend, asked Lord Perth to combinewith his duties as Director General Designate of theMinistry of Information a general supervision, under himself,over the foreign publicity activities of the Foreign Office,      It seems hardly necessary for me to add - though itmay be well that I should state it most emphatically - thatthe Government have no intention in time of peace of instituting any kind of censorship or control on the Presswhatever or of starting a Ministry of Internal Propaganda,
