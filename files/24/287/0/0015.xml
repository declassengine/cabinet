4L*V&apos;9(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .  Memo ran dura by  the  Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.     The Public  Accounts Committee and the Select Committeeon Estimates have on more than one occasion expressed astrong view that, in accordance with the general government policy, costing  should be applied in the case of allmachine tools  supplied for the purposes of the rearmament programme.     The late Minister for Co-ordination of Defence seton foot negotiations accordingly with the Machine ToolTrades Association.  That Association offered the mostdetermined resistance to costing, the main grounds being that the industry is still genuinely competitive and thuscosting should not apply to it, that great part of itsproducts are supplied on published lists of prices whichare the same to  everybody, and that its success in maintaining a considerable export trade is evidence thatits prices are reasonable.  The Association also brought forward the facts, which have to be admitted,  that theindustry has, at its own cost,  largely expanded its capacity in recent years,  to  the great benefit of the rearmament programme,  that  it had previously gone through very leanyears and that it has a most uncertain future before it inview of /the recent large importations of foreign machine tools to which the Association had been a consenting partyin order to get the  rearmament programme forward as quickly as possible.   The Association however could not deny thatSECRET.COPY NO.CP. 152 (39).C A BINET.MACHINE TOOLS,
                                                      i f* ft                                                      JL d &apos;dk  .during the currency of the rearmament programme the tax-payer had been by far its largest customer and had a fairclaim to some reduction in price by reason of the size ofthe business done.     Eventually the Association, while maintaining itsresistance to costing, offered a discount on all programmeorders placed after the 5th of December, 1933, being theday when the late Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceopened negotiations.     This offer was obviously inadequate and the problem was referred to the Prime Minister&apos;s Advisory Panel forconsideration and advice.  They saw representatives of theAssociation, and, in effect, recommended as reasonable asettlement on certain lines which will be seen from theletter sent by me to the Association of which a copy isattached to this memorandum as an Annex.  The despatch ofof this letter followed further negotiations between myself and the Association and conferences with representatives ofthe Treasury and the service Departments, who were inagreement with it, as was also the Minister of SupplyDesignate.     The main points in the letter are acceptance of theprinciple of costing for non-standard articles (i.e.  articlesother than those included in the published price lists),agreement to a discount for one year on programme suppliespaid for by the taxpayer (not ordered after 5th December,1933, but delivered after that date,) and reservation of theposition in case of special legislation being passed whichaffects this problem.     The amount of money involved in the 5% discount isdifficult to estimate but should be at least of the order of half a million pounds.     The agreement may be criticised on the ground that thecompetition for tools (other than the non-standard tools,which can be costed) is not really effective in circumstances
when we need for our programme as much of the output of theindustry as we can get, and that therefore the industry should submit to costing on all tools ordLered..     The answer to this is I think that, as we matureour plans for the expanded army supply now necessary, weshall probably have to go into the whole matter afresh and make new terms with the industry, supported as we hope soon to be by the compulsory powers provided in the Ministry ofSupply Bill.     Meanwhile the agreement reached has very solidadvantages.  I shall have soon to make the terms of itknown in the House of Commons, but I thought it well first to bring it to the notice of my colleagues and secure their general concurrence.

1 v*v&apos;c*                  ANNEX.Copy of a letter dated 22nd Hay, 1959, from the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster to the Machine Tool Trades                 Association.Dear Mr. Butler,     I regret that it has taken some time to answer your letter of the 28th March.  I am now writing to say thatthe Government agree to the arrangement set out in ourcorrespondence,  the effect of which they understand to beas follows:-     (a) A discount of 5% will be allowed by manufacturing          members of your Association on all orders for          standard machine tools and/or standard tools and          accessories therefore ordered or delivered after          5th December, 1938.     (b) The prices ruling on 5th December,1938, will remain          in force with only such alterations as may be          justified by circumstances affecting the basic          costs, e.g. that of pig iron, of the machines in          question.  Downward as well as upward movements          of such basic costs shall be talc en into account.     (c) The price to be paid for non-standard machines and          for tools and accessories will, if so desired by          II.M., Government, be ascertained by reference to          contractors books by Government accountants.     (d) H.M. Government will advise the Machine Tools firm          concerned of the orders to which the discount          should apply and cheques or credit notes mil be          sent to the Government.     (e) Any manufacturing member to whom the granting of          these concessions appears to be a hardship may          approach the appropriate department of the          Government for consideration.This arrangement will remain in force until 5th December, 1959, inclusive, but may be subject to review in the event of legislation, being passed in the future.  If under any powers which may be conferred on the Government it shall be decided not to exercise such powers in respect of the Members of your Association, then the provisions of this agreement would hold good.Yours etc.  (Signed) W.S. kORRISIONtlarold Butler, Esq., M.B.I;., J.P. , The Machine Tool Trades Association,   Victoria House,     S ou t hamp to n Ro w, W. 0.1.
