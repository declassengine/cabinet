Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     THE Prime Minister&apos;s statement on the 26th April as to the governments intention to  introduce compulsory military training, included a statement thatwe would &apos;&apos; take further steps to limit the profits of firms mainly engaged on the rearmament  programme.&quot;   In  his speech on the 27th April the Prime minister pointed out that every effort had been made by the method of costing investigation to prevent unreasonable profits, &apos;&apos; but the difficulty has been that  the conditions have been constantly changing, and, in particular, frequent enlargements of our plans, which, of course, meant a tremendous enlargement of orders which hadto be doubled or trebled, have upset  the plans and have allowed profits to bemade on a scheme which, when it was formulated, seemed to be entirely water-tight.&quot;  He went on to say that there was no desire to deprive armament concernsof reasonable profits, but that it was  repugnant to the general sense that profitsshould be unreasonably swollen.     2.  The Government declaration,  therefore, was addressed to excessive profits made by  &quot;firms mainly engaged on the rearmament  programme.&quot;  There isdifficulty in  defining more precisely the class of firms  intended, but it  is clearthat what was contemplated is not a general tax on large profits covering thewhole field of industry,  like N.D.C. No. 1 or the Excess  Profits Duty.  I thinkit is very desirable to limit the application of our new proposals, both becausethe field of  opposition and criticism  will thereby be minimised and  because ameasure addressed definitely to armament profits is manifestly what was intendedwhen  the  announcements   above quoted were  made.  N.D.C. No.   1  was sovehemently  disliked (though I myself  think it  was a  very  ingenious and welldevised tax) that I cannot imagine  the Government  now putting it forward.And  E.P.D., though  it produced  vast  sums of revenue, also involved well-remembered  extravagances,  and I think it would be most imprudent of us to-revive these  historic controversies.  It would, indeed, be  more difficult to apply the system of E.P.D. to-day because,  instead of the standard revenue being inmost cases ascertained from an, average of past profits,  in many instances itwould be necessary to have recourse to the alternative of calculating capital, whichwas the aspect  of E.P.D. which gave most trouble.  Moreover, at the  presenttime, the profits of  industry generally are not expanding, at any rate  in  any marked  degree,  and a  tax on expansion  of business  profits  generally  seemsinappropriate to existing conditions.   Already a special contribution is got from industry as  a whole  by means of the existing N.D.C.       [19296]SECRET.CP. 122 (39).
    I conclude therefore that a new impost applied to the whole field of industryis  inappropriate, and that we  must do our best to  devise a method of specialapplication to armament firms.    3.  One method of doing this which has been suggested, but which I feelgreat difficulty in approving, is the following.  The list of armament firms within an appropriate definition  having been ascertained (say, by the certificate of theMinistry of Supply), the accounts of  these firms would be examined by a Boardof Referees constituted for the purpose (largely composed of eminent accountantsor at any rate with an accountant like Lord Plender as Chairman) in order thatthe Board  might determine  (presumably after hearing  both  the firm  and theCrown) whether the profits  made  are &quot;excessive.&quot;  No doubt  the  Act ofParliament  would  direct the Board&apos; of Referees to have regard to a list of considerations,  though I have some difficulty in imagining what the list wouldbe.  Upon  the  Board deciding  that  the profits are excessive by  so much, thisexcess would be a debt payable to the  Crown.    My present view is that the above plan would not be accepted by Parliament.It appears to be in flat  contradiction of one of Adam  Smith&apos;s principles oftaxation, viz., that  the tax should be &quot; certain and not arbitrary.&quot;   The Boardof Referees would be a Star Chamber.  I do not know if it would be possible toget eminent accountants to undertake such a task, for they might reasonably saythat their skill is in ascertaining what the accounts are  and mean, and not in deciding whether somebody&apos;s profit is or is not &quot; excessive &quot;  when they  have nomathematical  standard to go  by.   But in any case the plan would  seem tointroduce so much  uncertainty  into  armament business that  production mightbe seriously prejudiced.   An armament firm which had  entered  into contracts and duly delivered the  goods would not be able to distribute its profit until itknew what the Board of Referees would decide. This might perhaps be  got overin part by providing in the  Statute  for a minimum profit which the Board of referees should in  any case allow, but I still feel a great deal of difficulty aboutthe general method. It would be a precedent capable of very oppressive  applica-tion in different circumstances in the future, and it appears closely to resemblethe method by which Germany is understood to finance herself, by taking whateverfraction of a firm&apos;s profits she pleases.     4.  If we reject both of the above methods, we are left with the search forsome intermediate course  in which what is imposed is a tax on  the  excess profitmade by firms mainly engaged  on  rearmament  work.  Any plan  that can be devised bristles with difficulties at many points.  The best scheme so far investi-gated would run on the following lines :      A standard definition would be found for  armaments and thus for firmsmainly engaged on rearmament work.  This will be a matter of some difficulty;but the main point is that the  greater part, or at any rate a really substantial part, of  the firm&apos;s turnover  should be  the production of  supplies to be used inconnection . with  the  Governments  rearmament  programme.   There  is  a definition of Munitions in the Munitions of War Amendment Act, 1916  (5 and-geo.  V, Ch. 99, Sec. 9), but many new problems would need to be considered, forexample, for one reason  or  another we should  probably  wish  to exclude foodbought for or by the Government and  supplies bought by local authorities, &amp;c,in connection with Civil  Defence.  On the other hand, we should probably need to include such items as cloth for uniforms, steel for A.R.P., &amp;c.  The definition(on which I am in  communication with the Minister without Portfolio) might belimited to  contracts made by the Admiralty,  War Office, Air Ministry and theappropriate Department concerned  with  contracts for Civil Defence  require-ments, together  with.power to extend  the  list by  Order in  Council.   Sub-contractors for large supplies would need to be included.  Moreover, there would need to be a determination of some suitable fraction of a firm&apos;s turnover for thepurpose of deciding whether or not it was mainly engaged on rearmament.  51 percent, has been suggested, but I rather favour a figure like 40 per cent.     It is suggested that it would be the task of  the Minister of Supply, when he isduly constituted, to certify firms falling within the statutory definition.  If, as  islikely, the taxation legislation is introduced before the Ministry  of Supply  bill has  received  Royal  Assent, it would be necessary to give the  power to  a &quot; Minister of  the  Crown.&quot;  Certification would be required in respect of each annual accounting period of each firm, for a firm might be within the definitionin one accounting  period and not within it in  another.
    To the profits of the firms thus identified there would be applied a new duty(say the &quot; Armaments Profits Duty &quot; or A.P.D.) in respect of the excess above apermitted maximum.  The Inland Revenue very much hope that it will be possibleto avoid  the  reintroduction of a percentage standard based on an  estimate ofcapital, for this is  a most complicated matter, since the capital has to be theoriginal cost less wear and tea,r and would thus involve going back a long way and producing results which might seem extravagantly generous where large  blocks of capital have  been written down.   The  standard  might be the standard of profits previously earned either in 1935 or in 1936 (or perhaps on an average ofany two of the years 1935, 1936 and 1937).  Changes in the total capital would beallowed for by a percentage and new firms would have to be  given a capitalstandard  anyhow,  though this is not so  difficult as  the cost of plant,  &amp;c,recently acquired is immediately ascertainable and is representative of the  actualfinancial position.    The adoption  of a profits standard without the alternative of a capitalstandard might be  criticised by individual concerns on the ground that theirprofits in p re-armament years, and even their profits in 1937,  might have beensubnormal and that it would be unfair  to take these as a standard.  To meet this criticism  it is suggested that,  if  any concern claimed that its  actual  profitsstandard was not a  reasonable one on which to base the tax, the concern should begiven the right of appeal to a body like the Board of Referees of the Excess ProfitsDuty for such inci*ease  as that  Board might consider reasonable.    When the excess profit above the permitted standard has been ascertained, itwould be necessary to divide it between the armament and non-armament work,since it is only the  part applicable to armament work which should be  speciallytaxed.  In the event of  failure to reach agreement with the Inland Revenue, the concern should be given the right to appeal to some suitable body to reduce theamount of excess profit attributed to  armament work  if  it were able to showthat,  in fact, a proportionately greater profit has been made on its non-armamentwork.     The excess profit in respect of armament work being thus ascertained, therewould be a tax upon it say, 50 or 60 per cent.     5.  I had hoped that the Ministry of Supply would be able to produce a plan(and  to take powers accordingly in the Ministry of Supply Bill)  for future arma-ment contracts which would have secured by the very terms of the contract thatprofits could  not be above a suitable limit.   I understand,  however,  that theMinister without Portfolio is satisfied  after examination that no such plan couldbe devised to implement the undertaking given by the Prime Minister  in theannouncement to which I have already  referred.  In the circumstances, I can onlyrecommend for  the approval of the Cabinet the scheme outlined above, whichthough involved and troublesome is, I am satisfied, the least objectionable methodof implementing the Prime Minister&apos;s announcement by action in the sphere oftaxation.  It may well  be that the scheme would not produce any substantial sumof money in  spite of the very considerable amount of extra work  it would meanboth  for contractors and for the Inland Revenue   Indeed, the more successful the contracts Departments are in their efforts to prevent contractors from makinghigh profits,  the smaller should be the yield.  But the Government is pledged tointroduce further limitation of profits on armaments, and if the attempt is to bemade I can see no sound alternative to the scheme which I have described.     6.   Simultaneously with  this submission to the Cabinet, I am  in  directconsultation  with those of my colleagues who are mainly concerned. I am alsoseeking outside advice,  and I propose, inter alia, to discuss my proposals with theIndustrial Advisory Panel.   If  my proposals are approved in principle by theCabinet and if the consideration of the actual form of those  proposals is suffi-ciently advanced, it would be possible to make a statement in general terms on theSecond Reading of the Finance Bill,  which  is due to  take place on Thursday,the 25th May.                                                     (Initialled)       J. S.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,    May 19, 1939.
