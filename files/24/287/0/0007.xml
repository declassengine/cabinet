Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE  to my colleagues herewith a memorandum on  the Anglo-Soviet negotiations.                                                                      H.    IN accordance with the decision taken at the meeting of the Foreign PolicyCommittee on the 16th May (F.P. (36) 47th meeting), the Soviet Ambassador wasinterviewed on the morning of the following day.  His Excellency was told thatif he could get an indication from his Government that they would be prepared toaccept it, His Majesty&apos;s Government might propose a settlement on the lines approved by the Foreign Policy Committee (see p. 21 of F.P. (36) 47th meeting).M. Maisky undertook to refer to his Government by telegraph.    2.  On the morning of the 19th May, M. Maisky indicated that his Govern-ment would not be disposed to reach agreement on those lines and  that they main-tained their proposals, the chief amongst which was (in the words of telegramNo. 93 from  Moscow)  &quot; the conclusion between Great Britain, France and theU.S.S.R. of an effective pact of mutual assistance against aggression.&quot;  without this the Soviet Government claimed that the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment &quot; do not contain the principle of reciprocity with regard to the U.S.S.R. and place  the latter in a position  of inequality, inasmuch as they do not contemplatean obligation by Great  Britain and France to guarantee the U.S.S.R. in the eventof a direct attack on the latter by aggressors, whereas Great Britain and France,as well  as Poland, enjoy such a guarantee as a result of the  reciprocity which exists between them.&quot;    3.  It is  possible to argue that the proposals made by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  are strictly of  a  reciprocal  nature.   It is true that  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment do  not offer the Soviet Government an undertaking  of assistancein the event of  a direct attack upon the  Soviet Union.  But  nor, on the otherhand,  do His   Majesty&apos;s  Government  ask  the  Soviet  Government  for anundertaking  of  assistance in the event  of a direct  attack  upon the UnitedKingdom.  Then, again, it is  true  that  His Majesty&apos;s Government  have  notundertaken to extend their guarantee to Finland, Estonia and  Latvia.  But nor,for their part, do His Majesty&apos;s Government ask the Soviet Government to extend their guarantee, for  example, to Belgium and Holland.  Indeed, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are asking the Soviet Government  to do  something less than theyare undertaking to do  themselves, so that  if there is any lack of  reciprocity, the disadvantage would  seem to lie  with His Majesty&apos;s  Government  rather than with the Soviet Government.SECRET.CP. 124 (39).10402  [19307]B
    4.  The real ground of objection which the Soviet Government appear to haveto our proposals is not a matter of reciprocity (properly so-called) at all, but arises from  their feeling that a  difference exists between the situation of the soviet union and that of Great Britain, France and Poland.  The latter have all madereciprocal arrangements of mutual assistance amongst,, themselves,  whereas theSoviet Union has no  such arrangement except the Franco-Soviet Pact.  TheSoviet Government accordingly can claim that whereas  Great Britain,  Franceand  Poland  all receive something in return for  the undertaking into  whichthey have entered, they themselves receive nothing  in return for the declaration with we ask  them to make.  The Soviet Government also  seem to fear- thatthe mere fact of their making the proposed declaration might provoke  a direct attack upon the Soviet Union by Germany, and that in the absence of  a directguarantee from Great Britain and France to meet this contingency and in theabsence also of a guarantee  by Great Britain  and France to Latvia,  Estoniaand Finland, such an attack might be aimed  at the Soviet Union through thosecountries.    5.  There is also the possibility, in the Soviet view (such are their suspicions),that Germany might attack the Soviet Union  through Poland or  Roumania withthe connivance of, or at least without provoking the resistance  of, those countries.Seeing that our guarantee to those countries depends on their  offering resistance,we might not be involved, and the Soviet Union would be left alone  to deal witha German aggression.    6.  If the Soviet  Government really entertain this fear, it is evident thatwe shall have to undertake some commitment to allay it.    7.  The first question,  therefore, is  whether there is any way in which wecan;do this short of accepting the Soviet proposal for a simple three-Power pact of mutual assistance.                              The French Plan.    8.  The only suggestion alternative to our  own and  to the  Soviet proposals is the French plan, which has been formulated as follows :          &quot;If France and Great Britain found themselves in a state of war with,    Germany as a result of  the action  which  they had taken  with a  view to    preventing  all changes by force of the existing status  quo in Central or    Eastern  Europe,  the   U.S.S.R.  would  immediately  lend  them  aid  and    assistance.         &quot; If the U.S.S.R.  found itself  in a state of war with Germany as  a    result of the action which it had taken with a view to preventing all changes    by force of the existing  status  quo in Central or Eastern  Europe,  France    and Great Britain would immediately lend it aid and assistance.         &quot; The three  Governments  would  concert without delay on the  nature,.1   in both cases contemplated, of this assistance and will take all steps to ensure  ;  its full efficacy.&quot;.9.  A subsequent telegram from Paris shows  that the French government intended by their reference to &quot; Central or Eastern Europe &quot; to cover  Poland,Roumania  and  Turkey only  (Paris  telegram No.  207).    10.  Thus,  this proposal does not meet the Soviet requirements,  as it onlycovers the case  of German aggression through Poland, Roumania or Turkey.  Onthe other hand, while securing Soviet assistance  in  the case of aggression against those countries, it does not bind the Soviet Government to come to our assistance if we are the victims of German aggression either, direct  or through Holland,Belgium or Switzerland.                            Possible A Uematives.     11.  There is  no other definite proposal before us,* and  if the foregoing-analysis of the considerations which govern the  Soviet attitude is correct, it maybe that there is no alternative between agreeing to a three-Power  pact such as theSoviet Government advocate  and allowing the  present negotiations to  fail.  Itis desirable, therefore, to examine the possible results of adopting either of these courses.    .      t ,    *  Telegram No. 9 (L.N.), forming Annex (2) -to this paper, has been  received  since theabove was written.
     12.   As a preliminary, it may be well to consider what was our objective in the first instance in soliciting the aid of the Soviet Government.     13.   The principal object of our guarantee to Poland was to deter Germany from any further acts of aggression, and by obtaining  a  reciprocal guarantee from Poland to ensure that, if war  must ensue, Germany would have to fight on two fronts.  We have been told that this is essential.  Germany is unable at the moment to embark on a war on two  fronts.  If she were free to expand eastward and to obtain control of the resources of Central and Eastern Europe, she might then be  strong enough to turn  upon the Western countries with overwhelming- strength.     14.   Our object was, therefore, beginning with our  guarantee of Polish independence, to build up a peace front to the East  and South-East of Germany consisting of Roumania, Poland,  Turkey and Greece.   Of this  combination Poland  was the key,  and Poland&apos;s position  would be precarious in face  of a hostile or perhaps even of a neutral Soviet Union.  Our only practicable lines of communication with Poland in case of war would lie  through Russian territory.     ,15.   We therefore wished to be assured of at least the benevolent neutrality of the Soviet Union, and better still of the probability of assistance being afforded by  that country to Poland and Roumania in case of attack.                      Polish and Roumanian Misgivings.     16.   We could not ask of the Soviet Union anything more positive or binding than what we did, in  fact, suggest in  view of -the misgivings on the part of the Polish  and Roumanian  Governments.   We  were early made aware of  these misgivings  by  the reception of our proposal for a 4-Power consultative  pact between Great  Britain,  France, the  Soviet  Union and Poland.  The Polish Government at once indicated that  they were unwilling to  be associated in this manner  with the  Soviet  Government,  and we discovered subsequently that the Roumanian Government would share these misgivings.  Both of those countries mistrusted the Soviet Union, did not expect anything very concrete in the way of material  assistance  from her,  and feared   that if they  definitely  associated themselves with the Soviet Union, that might offer just the provocation that would be required to drive Herr Hitler into an act of aggression.     17.  Recently it has  been asserted in various quarters that too much.weight can be given to these misgivings, and that, in point of fact, neither Poland nor Roumania would object to an arrangement which, while having the disadvantage of associating them openly with the Soviet Government, would secure that the latter would, in the event of war, be  ready to render assistance if desired.     18. , We are consulting the Polish and Roumanian Governments by telegram on this point and are pointing out to them that the scheme which we might have to propose to the  Soviet  Government,  while providing that the latter would  in certain eventualities be under an obligation to render assistance to Poland and Roumania, would ensure that  such assistance  would  only  be given subject to the consent of, and in a manner approved by, those Governments.     19.  It seems essential, in the first place, to  clear up these doubts.  There would be no point in securing an undertaking of assistance by the Soviet Govern- ment if the effect of  that were to be  to deter the Polish and  Roumanian Govern- ments from figuring openly in a bloc  organised to resist German aggression.    20.  If the Polish and Roumanian Governments are not wholly in principle opposed  to the close association of  Great Britain and France with  the Soviet Union,  it  remains  to consider  the advantages and disadvantages  of  such association.                Disadvantages of &quot;proposed Anglo-Soviet  Pact.    21.   A  triple  pact of mutual assistance between Great  Britain, France and the Soviet Union would be represented as the formation of an &quot; ideological &apos;&apos; blocagainst  the Axis  Powers.  It  would  be  said that abandoning any further attempt  to remain impartial :we were  deliberately aligning  for war betweenrival groups of Powers : it would be inferred that His Majesty&apos;s Government had      [19307]                                                     B 2
finally given up all  hope of arriving  at  a settlement with Germany and that accordingly they had reached the conclusion that war was  inevitable and were therefore marshalling their forces.    22.  In view of the attitude which Herr Hitler has adopted in the past inregard to the Soviet Union, it might be assumed that our association with theSoviet Government would still further infuriate him and impel him to aggressive action.                                                                   .    23.  In the light of many of Signor  Mussolini&apos;s speeches on the subject of communism in Spain, it might be expected- that Italy would be finally alienated.    24.  Similarly,  in  Spain,  the  Government  of  General  Franco,  which represents  itself as having conducted a successful crusade against Communism,might be driven still further  into the anti-Comintern party.               j    25.  And: there are other countries,  such as Portugal, Finland  and Yugo-slavia, where. a close association  between His  Majesty !s Government and theSoviet Union would have adverse effects on our relations.  It might even be saidthat such an association would weaken yet  further the Balkan Entente  and rendermore  difficult our chances of consolidating it.  Nor must it be forgotten that the vatican regard Moscow even to a greater degree than  Berlin as  Anti-Christ.    26.  The effect upon.Japan, where  there  has recently been  considerablehesitation in regard to Japanese association with the Axis Powers, might also be disastrous.  Although we have assured the Japanese Government that any agree-ment  that  we might make  with the Soviet Government would relate only to europe, the  Japanese  Minister for  Foreign Affairs . recently stated that anyAnglo-Soviet rapprochement would have  bad repercussions  in  Japan.    27.  The acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of a policy of a pact withthe Soviet Government might  be held to mark a definite change of policy.Hitherto,  His Majesty&apos;s Government have been endeavouring to safeguard theindependence  of  the  smaller European   States wherever  the threat to that independence appeared  to be imminent, and the  measures which they  have taken and the commitments into which they have  entered have been on a purely defensivebasis.  A pact with the  Soviet Union, although His Majesty&apos;s Government would enter  into it in a purely defensive spirit, would easily be represented as assumingan offensive appearance.    28.  The German propaganda on the subject of  &quot;encirclement&quot; would be reinforced and might rally the German population behind the regime in Germanyand destroy the last vestiges of the influence of the so-called German  Moderates.It must, however,  be admitted that hitherto the Moderates have done nothingeffective to make their influence felt. Moreover, it is they who have impressed onus the need of facing Hitler with a display of strength.    29.  There is  the  further objection that His Majesty&apos;s Government, either by the failure of Poland or Roumania to resist a German advance or by a german attack on  the Soviet Union by sea or through the Baltic States, might be drawn into a war not for the preservation of the independence of a minor EuropeanState, but for the support of the Soviet Union  against Germany.  On this issueopinion in this country, which is whole-hearted in support of  the policy of theprotection  of the  weaker European  States, might be seriously divided.   the pressure brought to bear upon France during the war in Spain will&quot; be fresh inmind, and  it cannot be  supposed that that example of Soviet methods is the last of  its kind.   Nor, perhaps, will it be forgotten how embarrassing  successive.French Governments have found the Franco-Soviet Pact to be.    30.  It has also to be considered that the  actual material  assistance to beexpected from the  Soviet Union is not very great.  It is true that the  Soviet fleetmight contain a proportion of German naval forces in the  Baltic, and that theSoviet air forces might be able to render some assistance.  It is, however, unlikelythat on land their military effort could be of very much effect,  and even in the,matter&apos; of - furnishing  munitions and  war materials  their  assistance would he-limited by the fact  that the Russian  transportation  system is in an extremelybackward state.       -  &apos;  &quot;    &quot;-.-  &apos;&apos;              u   &apos;:
   .31.  Finally, if close association with the Soviet Government is to: shake theconfidence  of those  friendly Governments to whom, we have  already  givenguarantees, it would seem on balance that there would be little advantage inrunning the various risks which have been pointed out above.  We shall, however,be able to weigh this point when we have received replies to the telegrams whichhave been sent to Warsaw and Bucharest.                 Advantages of Proposed  Anglo-Soviet  Pact.    32.  So  far  attention has been drawn to the disadvantages and  dangersinvolved  in a pact with the  Soviet Government.  But there  is something to besaid on the other side.  Though it may be  held that such a pact might provokethe Axis Powers to war, it might, on the other hand, be the only way  to avertwar.  Germany is impressed  only by a show of strength, and Italian policy hasalways been to reinsure with  the&apos; stronger side.  If Spain follows in the train ofthe Axis, we remove danger from that quarter if the Axis can be restrained from war by the fear  of overwhelming forces against it.  Spain is in no mood and isnot in a  position to  make  war on  her own, and the same  applies, of course, to portugal and Yugoslavia.                                         &apos;    33.  Again, the policy which His  Majesty&apos;s Government  have adopted ofgiving guarantees to various countries, must be  made as effective as possible.There are signs  that our guarantees, unless we can  make  serious material con-tribution  to  the strength of the guaranteed  countries,  are  causing,  the  lattersome misgiving.   They have put themselves in the forefront of  the anti-Germanbloc by accepting our guarantees (and in some cases giving reciprocal guarantees),and in this  position they  naturally look to us  to supply them with material assistance.  Poland,  having mobilised a large portion of her  army, is beginning to feel the pinch economically, and to realise some of her shortages in material.These would have to be made good in great part  in war time by importation offoreign material through Soviet territory, and she might therefore be thoroughlyuncomfortable with  a  doubtful Soviet Russia in  her rear.  And if the eastern front, built up on Poland, were to collapse,  Germany would be freed from.the fear of a two-front war.  Therefore, it might be claimed that  a tripartite pactwith the  Soviet Union,  if that is the only means by which  we can be assured of the latter&apos;s support, is a necessary condition for the consolidation of the frontwhich we have been trying to create.     34.  The advantages of  a pact with  the Soviet  Union are to be estimated in great part by contrast with the disadvantages which might arise from a break-down of the present negotiation.     35.  To take the worst possibility, there might be a German-Soviet rapproche-ment.  It  is easy enough  to realise. the danger which this  would  present, butit is difficult to assess  the chances  of it happening.     36.   It is noticeable that during the past few months anti-Soviet propaganda in  Germany has been almost completely damped down :  we know  that certain members of  the German General Staff  are in favour of an understanding withthe Soviet Union, and we have some evidence that they have lately again beenadvocating it.     37.  As regards German propaganda on the subject of &quot; encirclement,&quot;  thisno doubt would be worked for all that it is worth.  But that might equally be soin the event of our securing the Soviet Governments assent to our own proposals.Anglo-Soviet negotiations are being carefully  watched,  and  if  agreement isreached,  no matter what the exact terms, that will be represented in interestedquarters as an Anglo-Soviet  alliance.  If the negotiations  break down,  this  alsowill be made the most of by  German propaganda, and the German Governmentmay be encouraged to think that they are free to embark on adventures in Danzigor  elsewhere in  Eastern Europe.                                        -     38.   In any arrangement that we may make with the Soviet Government itseems desirable  to obtain the utmost that we can for ourselves in exchange for anything that we offer to the Soviet Government.    Under  our own proposals,though we should secure Soviet assistance in the event of our fulfilling our GOBI-commitments to Poland and Roumania, we should not  secure, it in the event of a
German aggression in the west.  If we were to agree to a pact such as the SovietGovernment propose, we should, on the one hand, secure Soviet assistance in thewest in all circumstances, and as against that our liability to the Soviet Govern-ment would only be increased by the eventuality of  a German attack on SovietRussia by sea or through the Baltic States (considered by the Chiefs of  Staff tobe rather remote) or through an unresisting Poland or Roumania.  Therefore, on balance, we should gain.  It would seem desirable to conclude some agreementwhereby the Soviet Union would come to our assistance if we were attacked inthe West,  not only in order to ensure that Germany would have to fight a war on two fronts, but also perhaps for the reason, admitted  by the Turkish Minister forForeign Affairs to General Weygand,. that it was essential, if there must be a war,to try to involve the Soviet Union in it, otherwise at the end of the war the soviet union, with her  army intact and England and Germany in ruins would dominateEurope.   (There are indications that the real Soviet  policy  is and would be toget us involved and then to try to keep out herself.)   Even though we may not beable to count implicitly on the Soviet Government either honestly wishing to fulfil,or being capable of fulfilling, their treaty obligations, nevertheless, the alternative of  a  Soviet  Union completely  untrammelled  and  exposed  continually  to the temptation of intriguing with both sides and of playing off one side against theother might  present  a no less, perhaps more, dangerous  situation than thatproduced by collaborating with  a  dishonest or  an incompetent partner.    39.  In view of close Turkish-Soviet relations, the negotiation of the furtheragreement  which we contemplate  with Turkey would be assisted by an Anglo-Soviet agreement.  Turkey might be embarrassed in meeting her commitmentsunder the Anglo-Turkish declaration regarding the Mediterranean  if she wereuncertain  as to the position of the Soviet Government.  And it may be  difficultto induce Turkey to assume more definite  commitments in regard to an aggression against Roumania unless she can  feel that the Soviet  Union forms part of theorganisation against aggression.    40.  In order to visualise what kind of formula would be required  to meetthe wishes of the Soviet Government, while at the same time securing that Sovietassistance  would be  available for Poland and Roumania, the  following  roughdraft has been evolved :         &quot; If the U.S.S.R. is engaged in hostilities  with a European Power, in    consequence either of aggression by  that  Power against another European    State which has requested Soviet assistance, or of aggression by that Power    against the U.S.S.R., France  and Great Britain will  give the U.S.S.R. all,    the support and assistance in their power.        &quot; If France  and Great  Britain  are engaged  in hostilities  with a    European Power, in consequence either of aggression by. that Power against    another European State which has requested their assistance, or of aggres-    sion by that Power against either of  them, the U.S.S.R. will give France and    Great Britain all the support and assistance in  her power.        &quot; The three Governments will  concert together  as to the methods by    which such mutual support and assistance could,  in case of need,  be made    most effective.        &quot; It is understood that the rendering of support  and assistance in  the    above cases is without prejudice to the rights and position of other Powers.&quot;    41.  Annexed are  two telegrams&apos; from the Secretary  of State  for  ForeignAffairs giving an account of his discussion with French Ministers :                ; l,*              (o       ,^           .    -       United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, to Foreign Office. (Received                             May 22,9-45 A.M.)                                                    Geneva, May 21, 1939.(No. 8.  L.N.)                                          (May 21,  6-20 P.M.)     Following  is an  account  of  my  conversation  with  the French  ministers at Paris&quot; yesterday about our Russian conversations :-      &quot;2,   I told them that,  in view of the  unsuccessful  result  of our  recentsoundings of M. Maisky (which I  gave them some account of), there seemed to usto be two possible alternatives : 
    &quot; (1)  A straight triple pact providing for mutual assistance  iii  the event            either of direct attack upon any of the parties or in the event of one            of them, becoming engaged  in hostilities through giving assistance            to some other Power.    &quot; (2)  An  arrangement  in the  shape of  a  formal pact by which  the three            parties would agree to act together  should  one of them become            engaged in hostilities on behalf of some other Power  that was the            victim  of aggression.  i  &quot;3.  I explained to them that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  would see greatdifficulty in agreeing to a straight triple alliance.  Our main objections, apartfrom those which w7e had  repeatedly emphasised, were, first, that such a pactmight well provoke  Germany to violent action, which we all wished to avoid,and, secondly, that  it might divide opinion in Great Britain, which was atpresent  firmly united behind the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government had beenpursuing during the recent months.    &quot; 4.  We had, however, set  down on paper outline of a direct triple pact inorder to see what it looked  like.  I then read to the French Ministers the draft(known  as draft B) contained in  paragraph 4 of my telegram No. 165 to Warsaw.I emphasised that I thought it  unlikely that His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe able  to accept such a draft.    &quot;5.  M. Daiadier said that the draft seemed to him quite acceptable andhe could not understand our difficulties.  Unless we concluded such an agreementquickly, we should increase rather  than  diminish the risk  of an act of force byGermany.  Such an act could only be averted if  Germany could be convinced that,if she  embarked  upon  this course, she would meet with effective resistance.Without the collaboration of Russia assistance could not  be  effective.   He didnot believe that  conclusion  of such a pact would  provoke Germany to violentaction.  Quite apart from the benefits, he did not think that Russia ought to betreated  on a basis less favourable than Poland.   We had entered into directreciprocal undertaking with Poland and the Soviet Union would have cause tocomplain if we did not  do the same with her.  He did not think that the SovietGovernment would accept anything less than this now, although  they might have accepted less a few  weeks ago when the French formula had been drafted.    &quot;6.  M. Daiadier added that an attack by Germany on Russia which didnot bring our Polish and Roumanian guarantees  into play was most unlikely to occur.  We should, in fact, not be increasing our obligations much by acceptingtriple pact.  I replied that, if, as he himself  had pointed out, what  Russiansfeared  was attack  by Germany  with  Polish  or Roumanian connivance oracquiescence, we  should,  in fact,  be undertaking  a heavier obligation,  sinceUnless Poland and Roumania resisted, our guarantee to them  would not comeinto force.  To this he replied  by saying  that in such a case France would be involved by Franco-Soviet pact,  and if this was so  it would surely  be impossiblefor us  to stand aside.     &quot;7.  I then turned to the  second alternative and said that on the journeywe had alternative draft which was based generally on French proposal of the3rd May but cast in the shape of a formal pact.     &quot;8.  I then read draft (known  as  draft  E), text of which is contained inmy immediately following telegram.     &quot; M. Bonnet observed that this formula would  include the Baltic States and small States in the  west provided  that they asked for assistance,  and I agreedthat this was so.     &quot;9.  M. Daiadier appeared rather  to like this draft  and thought it repre-sented  an  advance upon  our previous, ideas, but he did  not think the SovietGovernment would accept it now.  He&apos; thought that  their  attitude had stiffenedsince M. Litvinov&apos;s departure,  and that they were  now  on  their  dignity andwould accept nothing less than complete equality  and reciprocity.     &quot;10.   I had it in mind to  ask French Ministers to submit this formula to-Soviet  Government as an idea of their own, but as M. Daiadier said  that if he did this he would probably have,to touch it  up  somewhat, I thought  it wiser
snot to authorise him to act, and we agreed  that the next step would be forM. Bonnet and myself to explore the situation further with M. Maisky at Geneva.    &quot;11.  I asked French Ministers whether they thought there was a danger ofthe Soviet Government saying at any  moment that, in view  of  the  delay in accepting their ideas, they could not discuss the matter further and would drop the whole thing.   M. Daladier thought  that this was a  serious  danger.M. Litvinov&apos;s departure certainly meant something, and it might well be that soviet Government would think it the best policy to retire into isolation and letEurope destroy itself if it would.    &quot;12.  I asked  the French Ministers whether they thought that there was serious danger of an accommodation between Germany and Russia if we  failedto close with the Russians now.   They replied that this  danger could not be ignored since there was a party  in Germany  which was  in favour of such arapprochement.  Russian pol-icy was quite incalculable and was liable to suddenchanges.  It was impossible to follow the workings of the Soviet mind from day to day.    &quot; 13.  Since drafting the above I learn that Suritz has expressed the viewthat M.
