1 (1.X 0 ejHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.ECRET.                                                   COPY NO.   &apos;i 0.P.135(59).                                      CABINET.                           EXPORT GUARANTEES LEGISLATION.                 Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.               Under Section 4 of the Export Guarantees  Act, 1939,          the aggregate liability at any time  in respect of non-          commercial guarantees given under that section is limited  to           10 millions.   At the 41st Meeting  of the Foreign Policy          Committee on the 10th April,  it was  agreed to  approve in          principle a proposal that authority  should be  sought to          increase that limit by an amount to  be determined by the          Chancellor of the Exchequer in consultation with me.               The immediate need for this legislation arises from the          fact that decisions to grant non-commercial credits to the          amount of  5 millions to Roumania, and of substantial sums          in other cases,  already entail commitments far exceeding the          present limit of  10 millions.    Although the  legislative          programme is very much congested, I  am satisfied, after          consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that it is          essential to obtain new legislation  before the summer recess.               The amount of the increase which Parliament would be          asked to sanction will be dependent  on the course of          discussions which are now taking place with the Polish          Delegation.   It is suggested that the Chancellor of the          Exchequer and I might be authorised  to decide  on the exact          figure in consultation with the Secretary of State for          Foreign Affairs.    It would be impolitic  to ask Parliament  to          sanction a larger sum than appears necessary to meet immediate          requirements, even though that course may make it necessary          to seek a further extension of the limit  by subsequent          legislation.   Apart from the increase of the  limit under                                      -1-
A b* &apos;i   Section 4, the only other material provision would he a   clause to enable the Treasury to arrange finance for promissory   notes, etc, guaranteed by the Department at times when these   notes cannot be marketed on advantageous terms.   The terms of   the Bill will be kept as simple as possible in order that it   may be dealt with as a non-contentious measure.        I therefore ask for the concurrence of my colleagues in   the introduction of this legislation;  and, subject to their   approval, I propose to bring a draft Bill before the Home   Affairs Committee at the earliest possible date.                                        O.P.G.S.Board of Trade,   16th June, 1939.
