INTRODUCTION.    WE were appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in September 1938 withthe following terms of reference :-          &quot;In  the light of the recent Report by the Chiefs of Staffs, and of the    Reports of the Cabinet Committee on  the&quot; &quot;Defence of  India, and having    regard to  the increased cost of modern armaments, to  the desirability of    organising, equipping and maintaining the Forces  in India in accordance  .  with modern requirements, and to the  limited resources available in India    for defence expenditure, to examine and report, in the  light of experience    gained in executing the British rearmament programme, how these resources    can be used to the best advantage,  and to make recommendations.&quot;    2.  The main body of our Committee assembled in London on the 3rd October.We held certain meetings  and heard  evidence before sailing for India on the26th October.   General Auchinleck joined  the Committee at Port Said on the30th October, and we arrived in India on the 7th November.    3.  We have held 78 meetings in  all, and have consulted 83 witnesses, bothofficial and non-official, on all aspects of our enquiry.  We are much indebted toall these witnesses for the assistance they have afforded us.    4.  At the outset of our enquiry we were anxious that the many  witnesseswho were due to appear  before us should feel free to express their views in thefullest and frankest terms.  With the  consent of His Majesty&apos;s  Government, we accordingly adopted the principle that evidence tendered to the Committee shouldbe regarded as  strictly confidential, and all the witnesses who appeared before us have been informed in this  sense.    5.  The greater part  of  our time  in  India has inevitably been spent in new Delhi, where we could maintain close touch with the defence authorities ofthe Government of  India.   We have,  however, made visits  to  Bombay,  to theNorth-West Frontier and to Calcutta, in the course of which we were able to supplement the formal evidence tendered to us by many valuable  discussions withthe authorities on the spot.  We also visited the Ordnance Factories at  Cossiporeand Ishapore, where we discussed the general question of munitions manufacture in India with the Master-General of the Ordnance and his staff.    6.  Our Report is divided into four Parts, and  the titles  of the chapterssufficiently  indicate its general arrangement.  We are glad to say that in all itscardinal features our Report is unanimous.  The  only differences of opinionrecorded are those  in regard  to  the employment of air forces  on the WesternFrontier (paragraph 50), and to the strength of air  forces necessary for India&apos;slocal defence (paragraph 170).    7.  Our stay in India has lasted about three months, and during this period the work of our Committee has thrown  a heavy burden on the authorities in Indiaconcerned with defence.  We gratefully acknowledge  the extent to which theirready co-operation has facilitated the completion of our task.
PART I. SURVEY.                CHAPTER  1. CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL.    8.  Much of the ground which our enquiry covers has, of  course, been thearena of acute political controversy in  India.  It is not within our province asan Expert Committee to deal with political issues, or to examine proposals fromthe point  of view of their political bearing.  We have, however,  thought it rightto take such steps  as we could to inform ourselves of the trend of public opinion in India at the present time on Indian defence problems, since without such a background our appreciation would  have  been  manifestly  incomplete.    Inparticular, we have endeavoured  to gauge  the political  tendencies that seem likely to develop with the introduction of Federation, seeing that our recommenda-tions and  the principles which govern them involve a programme extending overa number  of years, and we have no option but  to assume that Federation will comeinto being within that period.                  Trends of Indian opinion  in British India.    9.  We begin by setting out certain opinions which appear to be widely heldin Indian political circles with regard to the defence  forces.. We should explain that paragraphs 10 to 17 relate to British India alone.  We record separately inparagraph 18  such impressions as we were able to form in relation to the indian states.    10.   The  leaders of the Congress Party, and the leader of the Muslim League,did not see their way to appear before the Committee; nevertheless, we have hadvarious ways of informing ourselves of what appear to be their general views andaims,  partly from  evidence of  a secondhand character, and partly from informal conversations.  We recognise, however, that our survey must necessarily have beenincomplete, and that in any case it is difficult  to extract with any certainty thereal views held by the leaders of  Indian political parties. We are conscious,therefore, that the impressions which our contacts with Indians and others have left with  us might  be modified by a longer and wider acquaintance  with thekaleidoscope of Indian politics.    11.   With this caveat, we would summarise our impressions of the views wehave gathered as follows.  It is generally held that Indian defence expenditure isaltogether disproportionate to the  resources  of the  country.   It is thought, inparticular, that the cost of maintaining British troops in India is a burden ofwhich India should be wholly or largely relieved. The claim  is made that theBritish troops constitute nothing but an army of occupation, which is not needed for the protection of India, but is rather maintained to hold her in subjugation.The presence of such an army of occupation  is regarded as inconsistent with thepolicy of  trust which the British Government profess to follow  in their dealings with India.  The critics do not deny that India should possess efficient and up todate defence forces of her own, but hold that they should be completely Indian.Further, they  claim that India should be made as far as possible self-sufficing inthe matter of  war material, so that the money spent on it should circulate in thecountry and so help to promote its prosperity, and that  India should become independent of external sources of supply which might fail her at  the criticalmoment.  The forces maintained and paid for by India should contain no marginavailable  for  use  in  what are regarded as  Imperial, as distinct  from Indian,interests.   Lh some  quarters it was  suggested  that if and when  Indians  were granted full  political freedom, or even some  measure of  control over defence policy; India  might be ready to co-operate  with other members of the  BritishCommonwealth in measures for their joint security;  but that until that stage isreached Indians must  disclaim all concern with defence problems into which any element of Imperial interest is held to enter.  Lastly, there are some who professto believe  that India can build up for herself in a reasonable time  a defence system,including naval forces, which would enable her to stand alone.
    12.  The views we have just summarised show either a striking ignorance of the true facts of the position, or a refusal to admit them.   We  realise thatefforts have been made by the India defence authorities to inform Indian publicopinion in these matters, but clearly there is still vast room for educating it to a proper  understanding  of strategic  problems  as  well as  a  proper sense  ofresponsibility.  For, instance,  the theory that British troops  are not needed  forthe protection of India takes no account of what  would be likely to happen ifthey were withdrawn altogether.  Again, there is little realisation of the extentof India&apos;s dependence on the Royal Navy.  There was  a tendency to brush aside the vast financial commitments involved  in creating naval,  land and air forcesadequate to defend India against predatory neighbours; or it was assumed thatthey could somehow, be met by the saving effected by substituting Indian  forBritish forces, and by promoting industrial development in India on  such a scaleas to make her self-sufficing.  By a few, however, we found it admitted, though perhaps unwillingly, that the conception of a self-supporting India is an idealwhich could  only be realised, if at  all, after years of peace and prosperity; andthat in the meantime India must still look to Great Britain for her main defence against aggression.  The prevailing state  of ignorance or obtuseness in thesematters is, indeed,  a positive source of danger so long as it remains uncorrected,since it is often exploited to create  an atmosphere of prejudice and suspicionagainst the whole defence system.     13.  We should make it clear that the views we have cited are predominantlythose held in Hindu circles.  Muslim opinion  tends to be more realistic in itsoutlook, and- in particular to recognise the value of British troops in securing thepreservation of law and order on a basis of justice between conflicting communalinterests.  The growing cleavage between the two great communities is, of course,a matter of common knowledge.  It has been vividly impressed on us in the courseof our enquiry, as the succeeding paragraphs will  show. We need hardly stressits importance as  a factor to be  considered  in determining the strength and organisation of the defence forces of India.                         Prospects under  Federation.     14.  We turn now  to the political  outlook.  The present position of  theCentral Government in regard to Defence is admittedly unsatisfactory.  There isan irremovable Executive confronted by a  hostile  and  irresponsible  majority inthe Legislature which, though debarred from assuming direct control, exerts  asteadily increasing pressure of criticism, and in doing so can claim to be the solerepresentative of Indian opinion.  In some official quarters the hope has been expressed to us that under Federation the position of the defence authorities maybe eased in two ways;  first, because the responsibility for defence administration,which will rest with the Governor-General instead of  the collective  Governmentof  India, should become more  distinctively defined than  now; and, secondly,because the volume of irresponsible criticism should be lessened in proportion asthe Federal  Ministry  can be  relied on to  support the  Governor-General in hisdefence policy and to secure the compliance of their  followers in the Legislature.     15.  Important  witnesses,  however,  both  official  and  non-official, wereapprehensive as to the future.  Their fears may be summarised as follows : TheCongress Party claim,  as   a  condition  precedent   to  Federation,  that  theConstitution should be so amended to provide, first, that the representatives ofthe Indian States in the Federal Legislature shall be chosen by election  and not by the personal nomination of the Ruler;  and, secondly, that Defence shall not be reserved but shall be handed over to the Federal Ministry.  By the first expedient,it was said, the Party hope to secure an effective&apos;majority in the Legislature; andby the  second, to use that majority for the furtherance of their plans, which include domination over all non-Hindu communities and the elimination of theBritish connection.   The threat behind these claims is that  if they  are  not accepted, the Congress Party will launch a mass non-co-operation movement, whichwould entail the resignation  of the  Congress Ministries in the Provinces, and,by compelling a reversion to pure  autocracy, would  nullify  all  the progressalready made.
    16.  These witnesses did  hot  deny the possibility that in  the  event  theCongress Party might persuade themselves to accept Federation without amend-:ment of the Constitution, as they had persuaded themselves to accept provincial autonomy.  Even so, they felt that the Party would find ample opportunity forundermining  the constitutional  position as  regards  Defence.   They  would command  great  influence in  the Federal Legislature;  if represented  in  theMinistry, they would exploit the process of consultation between the Reserved andthe Ministerial sides which the Constitution enjoins; they would exert formidablepressure on the Governor-General  to  compromise with their views on defence expenditure and administration; and they would seek to restrict supplies  so thatthe sums certified by the Governor-General to be required for Defence, although not submitted to  the  vote of the  Legislature, would not in fact be forthcoming from the revenue available.  A number of witnesses held that the constitutionalsafeguards had not worked in the Provinces  as had been intended, and felt thatthe safeguards relating to Defence at the Federal Centre, though different in kind,would similarly fail to prevent encroachments such as those just described.    17.  The  Muslim attitude towards Federation is largely conditioned by theCongress attitude.  We  gathered that some Muslims at any rate would welcomeFederation in  principle, as a means to responsible self-government  for India; but against this they feel that they have to weigh the  political consequences to theirown community.  A large number of responsible Muslims are seriously alarmedby  the prospect of a Congress majority at the Centre gaining virtual control,whether by direct or  indirect  means, over  defence policy.   They affirm that oneof the avowed objects of  the Congress Party is to get rid of the British troops inIndia,  which are  to them the guarantor of the British connection.   They see theCongress  Party  as  a very  powerful  organisation,A well-equipped with moneyprovided by Hindu industrialists who have grown  rich under British  rule.  and almost all  sections of Muslim opinion are alarmed by the prospect of  Hindudomination at the Centre.  They feel that the recent intensification of communalbitterness is due in large part to Congress rule in the Provinces.   They see signsof the Congress Party&apos;s intentions in the latter&apos;s demand  for the formation ofan  army on a &quot;national&quot; basis.   So  far as this  implies that enlistment in theRegular Army should be thrown open  to all classes, its purpose appears to be to counteract the relatively high proportion of Muslims  in the Army as its existsto-day.   But the intention may also aim at the creation of a national militia to offset the Regular Army by weight of man-power and so make Congress the mastersof the situation in the military as well as the political sphere.                              The Indian States.    18.  We complete this brief description  of present trends of Indian opinionon the subject of  Defence by a reference to the views of the Indian Princes, three off  the most prominent of whom we have heard  in evidence.   These  witnessesemphasised their full loyalty  to the  Crown and their undivided faith in. thecontinuance of the British connection.  They showed a keen appreciation of the dangers which beset India both within and outside her borders, and they stressed the importance of the part which the Indian States can play in helping  to meetthose dangers. In this connection they urged that a more liberal attitude shouldbe adopted towards them in the matter of supply of military equipment to enablethem to play a more effective part in the common cause.   We refer to this questionagain in Chapter 6, Section 7.  The  attitude of the Princes whom we heard inevidence to the prospect  of Federation was one of concern, as they felt that therehad been a dangerous change in the situation since they first accepted the principleof Federation.  They referred to the hostility manifested by the Congress Party,which now controls most of the Provincial Governments, to the Crown and to theStates, and also to the declarations of both the Congress Party and of  the muslim league in  favour of complete  independence; and on these grounds  they expressedthe deepest apprehension as to the future.                , .    Necessity for a settled defence policy.    19.  We  have dwelt on  these factors  because they  are  material  in theconsideration  of the cardinal assumption on which we have based  our recommen-dations.  The witnesses, official and non-official, who expressed disquiet as to the
results of Federation were clearly asking themselves, for the most part with some anxiety, whether the British Government intend to stand by the Constitution Act,or are going to allow its principles to be undermined by processes such as we have described.   We have  been  able  to proceed on no  other assumption than that asettled defence policy can and will be laid down, in accordance with the  principlethat responsibility for the  defence of India rests  through the  Governor-Generaland the Secretary of State for India, with the British Government and with noone else; and that  this responsibility  will in no respect  be weakened  whateverpolitical pressure is brought to bear  on the Government of India either  before or after the coming  of Federation.  This assumption appears to us to be  definitelyessential, not only  to  the continuity of any plans which may be  based  on our recommendations but,  indeed, to the making of defence plans  of such  a generaland far-reaching nature as we have  been called on to make.    20.  At the same  time we realise that the terms of the Government of india act of 1935 do not in themselves by any means cover the whole ground.  Theyare interpreted and amplified by various authoritative statements of policy, suchas those contained in the Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on IndianReform,  1934-35, and in the draft of the Instrument of Instructions which it isproposed that His Majesty should be advised to issue to the Governor-General onthe coming  of Federation.   We note in  particular that paragraph XVII  of thedraft Instrument, which has already been made public, enjoins  a practice of consultation  between  the Governor-General and the Ministry on certain  aspectsof Defence,  for reasons which  are  set  out  in the Parliamentary Committee&apos;sReport.  We have already referred  to the need for educating  Indian opinion in defence matters, and  it has been impressed on us  from several quarters that thepractice  of  consultation would prove a  valuable or even  essential  means to  thisend.  The whole idea of consultation, however, obviously presupposes that the ministerial no less than the Reserved side would seek to serve the common interest in a spirit of loyalty to the  principles of the Constitution.   The positionwould  be very different if, as much of  our evidence indicates, the process of consultation were to be used as a means of whittling away the responsibility ofthe  British  Government for the defence  of India,  with  the final  object ofestablishing  a sectional oligarchy in unlimited power.  We have  felt  bound  tokeep this possibility  closely in mind in considering  the problems of internal security.              CHAPTER 2. GENERAL STRATEGICAL APPRECIATION.     21.  The changes that have taken  place in recent years  in the strategical situation as it affects  India  are summarised both in the  Government of  India&apos;sletter of the 9th February, 1938, and in the Report of Major-General  PownalPsSub-Committee.  In the light of these summaries, and of the evidence which hasbeen placed  before us in India,  the  situation as we see it to-day appears  asfollows :                           The  North-West Frontier.Russia.     22.  Since the Great War the threat from Russia, for so long the determining factor in the defence  of India,  has  receded.  It is at present  possible, and mayfor some time remain possible, to exclude the Russian threat from among theimmediate and pressing aspects of  the problem, and to rank it  somewhat lowerin  the scale of risks.  The  danger  is, however, latent, and the history of ourrelations with Italy in recent years  provides strong reasons for not dismissing sopowerful a  neighbour permanently  from our  thoughts.    This  reflection  isstrengthened by the fact that the Russian Air Force would be able to  develop a heavy  scale of direct  air attack against important objectives  in North-WesternIndia.A afghanistan. *     23.  The situation vis-a-vis Afghanistan has also undergone a change  inrecent years. The present  Government is well disposed  towards Great Britainand regards His Majesty&apos;s Government as its natural protector against Russia.So long, therefore,  as it remains in  power and adheres to its present policy, the
danger of Afghan aggression is for the time being dormant.  Unfortunately, thecontinued stability of the present Afghan Government, or even its friendship ifexposed to adverse influences, cannot be relied on.  The possibility of its fall and replacement by a Government with anti-British leanings has to be borne in mind.Moreover, the state of the country generally affords  promising scope for foreigninfiltration.  Both German and Italian influences have been at work in this field.German influence, which was originally directed towards economic  ends, is nowshowing a more distinctively political and anti-British bias, though it is exploitedmore  for  propaganda purposes  than for military designs.  Italian propagandahas also  made itself felt, and  a recent attempt to place Italy  in a dominatingposition  with regard  to  the  development  of  the Afghan Air Force was, weunderstand, the cause of considerable concern to the authorities in London as wellas in India.   This latter enterprise appears, temporarily at  all events, to havefallen short  of  success owing  to the  poor showing of the  Italian aircraft in comparison with their British competitors.    24.   Judged on the evidence we have heard it appears that the effects of suchforeign  influence as has been exerted to date need not be assessed too highly.The possibility of its development on more definitely anti-British lines is, however,too serious to be ignored, and the situation will clearly require careful watching.There is always  the  danger  that a hostile  Afghanistan  would offer  wideopportunities for foreign intervention in the  form of assistance,  whether covertor overt, from certain Great Powers.    25.    We refer in a later part of our Report to  the close connection betweenthe tribal situation within the international frontier, and our relations with theGovernment  of Afghanistan.  It will suffice to refer here to the fact that in theevent of  hostilities the Afghan Government would probably rely not so much ontheir  own Regular Army as on their power to  inflame the tribesmen  on both sides of the border against us.    26.   Taking all these factors together we conclude that India&apos;s defence plansmust provide for the contingency of Afghan aggression against India, coupled with  the certainty  of  widespread  tribal  disturbances,  and the possibility ofassistance by a Great Power or Powers which might assume serious proportions.Two  further points should be mentioned in this connection as they have a directbearing on the magnitude of the risk.   First, we have had evidence to the effectthat tribal armament has improved and is improving, and the tribal danger muston this  account be more highly assessed than hitherto.  Second,  the importance which must  be  attached to the Afghan threat is certain to be  affected by thedevelopment of her armed forces, a development which, paradoxically, the BritishGovernment  are bound to aid for fear  of its falling  into foreign hands.  In viewof the moral and material effects that would be produced by Afghan air raids on india, and the significance that  would be  attached  to them, the progress of theAfghan Air  Force clearly demands the closest attention.                            Other land Frontiers.    27.   On the Southern portion of the Western frontier and on  the northern frontier  the  danger of land and air attack may be regarded, for the present, asremote.The Far East.    28.   The result of Japan&apos;s operations in China may have a decisive influence on her power to threaten India hereafter.  Potentially, the threat already exists,and with it  the possibility that Japan might be acting in conjunction with oneor more Western Powers. &quot; If the danger materialised it might take the form of       (i)  An attack on Singapore, which would vitally concern India as well as           the rest of the Empire, and would directly menace her sea communica-           tions;      (ii)  Sea-borne raids on Indian coasts, which  could inflict  much  material           damage  and  cause  serious  alarm  among  the  civil  population,           intensifying the need for adequate Internal Security measures;       [18631]                                                       c
     (iii)  Air attack on Burma and India from advanced land bases, possibly in           Siam.  Although Burma is now politically separated from India and           has entered upon new responsibilities of her  own for Defence, India           would still be closely concerned with any form of aggression against           Burma.                                Coast Defence.     29.   The risks of attack from seawards indicated above can be particularised with reference to the &apos;&apos; scales of attack &apos;&apos; laid down by the Committee of Imperial Defence in regard to Indian ports.   By sea they include raids by cruisers and armed merchantmen; mine-laying; submarine attacks; blocking measures, and the possibility of landing parties.  By air they include occasional light  sea-borne raids launched from cruisers or armed merchantmen  lying outside the range of coast defence artillery.  We deal in another part of our Report with the measures to be taken for coast defence; and we refer here to the &quot; scales of attack &quot;  as illustrating the dangers to which India  might be exposed from the sea.                             Sea communications.     30.   Further, it is generally recognised  that  in addition to the  risk  of sporadic attack upon her coasts, India may for a period be exposed to the  risk of  interference,  whether by hostile  naval  or air forces,  with her  vital  sea communications.  These risks  may emanate not only from Japan but  also from Italy in the event of a world war in which Italy was  engaged against the Empire. To deal with them effectively it would be necessary,  apart from other reasons, to reinforce  certain  strategic points outside India.                                 Conclusion.     31.  We would sum up by saying that whereas the probability of land attackon India  by a major Power has for the time being receded, the threat of landattack by  Afghanistan still remains; while the risk of other forms of attack hasincreased  and  is  increasing.   The arena of India&apos;s defence against  external aggression should therefore now be regarded as covering not only primarily herNorth-We stern land frontier but also to an increasing  extent her sea communica- tions in Eastern waters and the strategic points which are vital to their security.                    CHAPTER 3. THE WESTERN  FRONTIER.             Section 1. -The General Policy and its  Application.     32.  We have devoted much time and consideration to the problem of theWestern Frontier, because the policy  there followed and the measures taken  to implement it have a direct effect on the defence forces of India, not only fromthe point of view of a potential war commitment,  but also from that of  a day-to-day  liability.   From both points of  view it must remain one of  the constantpreoccupations of the Indian authorities; and we feel we need offer no excuse forthe detailed study which we have given to it.                              Political aspects.     33.  The existing  policy  of  the  Government of India, as now  generally accepted,  was stated by the Secretary  of State for Foreign Affairs in 1936, in a communication to  the Afghan Minister in London, as follows :          &quot;The policy  of the  Government of  India in  regard  to their tribal     territory is to preserve the peace of the border, foster good relations with the     tribes, and gradually to introduce standards of civilisation and order into     the tribal area, together with the improvement of  their economic conditions.     Moreover, it is their policy to pursue these ends by  peaceful means  and by     agreement With the tribes and. not to resort to military  action,  except when     it  is- necessary to do so in order to preserve the peace  and to repel attacks on     British and protected areas, on British forces or on friendly tribes.&quot;
     34.   The policy thus defined  is usually described as the Forward Policy. The ultimate outcome would be the administration of the tribal areas.  It is directly opposed to the so-called Close Border policy which would confine Govern - ment action to the defence of the present administrative border, and would abandon any attempt at penetration beyond it.  It will be seen that the definition is a statement in very general terms, containing no indication of the particular methods by which the objects of the policy are eventually to  be achieved, or of the various stages which may be necessary for its fulfilment.     35.   Political control of the areas lying between the administrative border and the international frontier, is the responsibility of the Governor-General, who is in charge of the Department of External Affairs, with the Governor of the North- West Frontier Province acting as his agent. Although in a specified area political control might, as at present in Waziristan, be temporarily delegated to a military commander such as the General Officer  Commanding-in-Chief, Northern  Com- mand., the officers  of the Political Department, both  local and  central, must always be directly concerned in the action taken in these areas as  elsewhere on the Frontier.     36.   The whole tract of the tribal areas extends for  more than 1,000 miles along  the Western Frontier.   Although the Forward Policy  is  in  principle universal, the methods of its application present not one problem alone but many, which vary for each part of  the  Frontier according  to  the  characteristics of the tribes and.&quot;the conditions in which they live.  Thus, in Baluchistan the country is sparsely populated and the tribes generally have proved amenable to control. In  the North,  feudal conditions are found in such          Chitral,  Dir and Swat; the tribes are under the influence of autocratic  rulers; and the problem of maintaining good relations with them is thus simplified.   In certain other areas, such as  Tirah and the Mohmand country, the general  conditions  are such that strong economic pressure can be brought to  bear against recalcitrant tribesmen by denying access to their grazing grounds  or  interfering with their customary migrations.  Even so, it is still necessary to maintain strong reserves of force adjacent to such areas behind the administrative border, though at the moment they offer no threat of serious trouble.   Although the Forward Policy implies in the  end  the administrative occupation of these areas, the authorities are  content,  for reasons which  can easily  be understood, to leave well  alone and to do no more  than extend their  moral influence  by contact  from within the administrative border without attempting active penetration.     37.  Apart from  an  area  in  the  Khyber Pass,  the  only  part of  the unadministered territory  in  which  the  method of penetration  and  military occupation has  been  deliberately applied in recent years is Waziristan.  Here the  tribesmen  are intensely democratic by  tradition and particularly trouble- some.  They acknowledge no man as their master; they are amenable only in a fitful degree  to the influence of their  elders;  and they  are easily swayed by irresponsible adventurers of one type or  another.   Their  country is barren and they show little inclination to  develop its meagre resources.  They have been brought up to prefer the rifle to the spade.  It is here that the Frontier problem of to-day exists in its most acute  and challenging  form; and most of  our wit- nesses addressed themselves chiefly to the problem of Waziristan.     38.  Unfortunately, we have to record that  the views we heard in  evidencewere widely divergent  and at many points were in direct conflict with eachother.  Although we have been assured that the general policy holds good, therewas a substantial body  of evidence suggesting  that even if  it is accepted aspracticable there is  no  coherent plan for its application  and that  the  methods actually employed are unsound.   The  evidence,  in fact, embraced every shadeof opinion, ranging from those who were prepared in the main  to accept  thepresent state of affairs, through those who advocated changes of method some slight, some substantial  and  some  entirely radical-to one  or two who even favoured  a complete abandonment  of  the Forward Policy because its proper application within any  reasonable  time  was,  in their view, impracticable on account of the  prohibitive cost and  the  diplomatic difficulties it would createwith Afghanistan.[18631]c 2
     39.  We  can best  indicate the divergences of view by  summarising  themin a brief sketch of the main features of the Frontier problem.   We will begin by saying that no witness professed himself completely satisfied with the present state of affairs in Waziristan.  Some did not go beyond saying that the methodsnow in use  had proved not unsuccessful: it was pointed out, for instance, thatin comparison with the disturbed period of 1919-21, before the location of regulartroops in Waziristan in 1922. the frequency of raids, even during the disturbancesof the last  two  years, had dropped  fourteen-fold.   Other  witnesses qualifiedthis view by  saying that  the present  methods, although basically  sound,  wereproving only partially successful.   Others, again,  felt that some new effort must be made if  any real progress is to be  achieved.     40.  The principal directions in which it was suggested that a change mightbe made are classified below.  It will, of course; be understood  that the headsset out below are by no means exhaustive, and that necessarily they are closelyinter-related.   Our object  in setting them out is  to  illustrate the divergence ofview and the absence of any clear understanding  of the methods intended to achieve the aim of the present policy.                          The Disarmament Problem.     41.  In the  first place there  was  general agreement that a  great advancecould be made if it were at  all possible to secure the disarmament of the tribesmen.Some witnesses suggested that, given the possibility of disarming the tribes, theyshould be brought  under complete administrative control;  others thought theyshould be encouraged to maintain their own tribal police.    We mention  these suggestions, without dwelling on  them, because they pre-suppose  the  possibilityof disarmament, which remains the crux of the problem.  As to this, there seemedto be a considerable force of military opinion that a  deliberate plan of disarma-ment should be embarked upon.  Among the witnesses who favoured this course,one  thought it should be  attempted in a complete military  operation, but themajority advocated a gradual process, beginning with selected areas near theadministrative border and  proceeding by stages up to the Durand Line.  against this general view must be set the opinion held largely  by political officers thatdisarmament is impracticable, at any rate for many years to  come.  One or two,indeed, were doubtful of the wisdom of disarmament; others,  while  admitting itas an ideal  solution, felt that the political  difficulties were insuperable.    they pointed out, for instance, that disarmament if carried out by stages would requiregreat effort on the part of the Government, both to prevent the  infiltration of armsinto the disarmed areas, and to protect the tribesmen in those  areas against their neighbours who were still  armed.   The principal  objection  urged, however, wasthat the international frontier with Afghanistan presents no barrier which couldserve as the natural limit to the process.  It would be essential to  secure by some means  that disarmament, if pushed up  to the Frontier, could be effectively main-tained. For this purpose it would be necessary either to secure the co-operationof the Afghan Government, or to make the Frontier line impregnable against theimportation of arms or aggression by  Afghan tribesmen by holding it in force.The latter would in itself be a formidable task, and would be likely  to create gravedifficulty with  the Afghan Government.  The possibility, on  the  other hand, ofsecuring the co-operation of that Government would be attended by almost equaldifficulty.  One witness suggested  that pressure might be brought  to bear on theAfghan Government, either by impressing on them the need for behaving as goodneighbours and as fellow members of the League of Nations, or more directly by using such instruments as the trade agreement as a lever.  Others considered that pressure of  this kind would be highly undesirable.  Finally,  some witnesses feltthat the cost of effective disarmament would  prove  to be prohibitive, althoughothers  believed that it might in the end prove a profitable investment.                        Withdrawal of regular troops.     42.  The next main head relates to the question of withdrawing the regulartroops from occupied points in Waziristan.  Here the  conflict of evidence was again acute.  A br(oad line can be drawn between those  witnesses  who hold thatthe withdrawal of regular  troops,  even if militarily possible, would be politicallydangerous if  not disastrous, and  those who  hold that  the presence of regular
troops in the occupied areas acts as an irritant to the tribesmen and that a deter-mined effort should be  made  to  secure  its removal.   Those  who  deprecatedwithdrawal fear generally that it would be taken as a sign of defeat, and wouldresult in a loss of prestige which would produce the most serious reactions bothamong the tribesmen and on the Afghan Government.   Of the witnesses whofavoured  withdrawal,  one,  indeed, was prepared  to  face  the  consequences  of.immediate and complete withdrawal, but the majority contemplated that it couldbe effected only by very gradual stages.  Some witnesses suggested, that so long asit remained necessary to retain regular troops in the occupied areas they should refrain, as far as possible, from moving  about the countryside, and thereby reducethe irritant effect already referred to.  A further point made against the retentionof regular troops was that their presence offered a prospect of employment to the tribesmen in the form of contracts for transport and supplies, and thus provided an inducement to create or maintain a state of unrest for the sake of securing that troops must continue to be present.    43.  It was generally assumed that the regular troops,  if withdrawn, wouldbe replaced by Scouts, and, moreover, that the troops themselves could not safely be withdrawn further than the vicinity of the administrative  border.   Thequestion then  arises whether, if so withdrawn, they could appreciably be reduced in numbers.  One view was that, although troops must be held  in reserve on theadministrative border, the  task  of  giving close support  to the Scouts in the forward areas could be allotted to the air forces, and a possibility of reducing thenumber of troops might thus be envisaged.  Other witnesses held  that Scouts  couldnot be relied upon to perform their proper functions without the close support of regular troops; or at any rate that if a trial were given to the use of the air forces for close support, there should be no reduction in  the number of regular troopsheld in reserve within striking distance.                            Economic  development.    44.   A third heading relates to the possibility of promoting the economicwelfare  of the tribesmen,  by  such methods  as developing  where possible theresources of  the country,  instituting  schools  and hospitals,  and finding newchannels of employment, either within the country or outside it.  Some witnessesbelieved that there was little, if any, scope for agricultural development, though there might be room for small schemes  of colonisation or irrigation.  On theother hand, one witness  at any rate had hopes  that something  might  be done  inthe direction  of agricultural development,  animal husbandry and afforestation.There was a measure of agreement that the institution of schools and hospitalswas  in  itself desirable, though it is  to  be  noted  that,  while they would undoubtedly contribute a civilising influence, they would not directly help towardspromoting  economic self-sufficiency.   Against  all this, one witness of  greatexperience  went so far  as to say  that  economic  development was not onlyimpracticable, but  would be superfluous, since  the tribesmen did not ask for itand would not appreciate it. Various suggestions were made as to the possibilityof finding new channels of employment,  even so far afield as in the Burma frontier force, but it did not appear that any large-scale measure of relief was to be hoped for in this direction.                              Tribal Allowances.    45.   A fourth  head  relates to the continuance of the tribal allowances, which amount in all, we are told, to some Us. 8 or 9 lakhs ( 60,000 to  70,000) a year.Some witnesses held that these payments were nothing but a form of blackmail;that they led the tribes  to believe that the threat  of tribal unrest was a potentweapon  against the British Government;  and that the allowances  should  be discontinued.   Other witnesses represented that their discontinuance would  beregarded as a breach  of faith, of which the Afghan  Government might easily be tempted to take advantage  and which would have  irreparable effects on our prestige.                          The A afghanistan Problem.     46.   It will be noticed that at almost every turn the question arises how far the solution of the  Frontier problem depends on the actions  of the Government  of afghanistan and on our relations with that Government.   We  find it impossible
to state the answer with any real precision;  but we have no doubt that it is a factor of  the greatest importance in all considerations of the problem.  As wehave said  elsewhere, the present Government are well disposed to the British, butthe stability of their friendship cannot be  relied upon, and the possibility  of a hostile Afghanistan  always remains in the background.  Even  apart  from that,there is always a doubt how far the Afghan Government may be able or willingto co-operate in the  work of pacification  along the international border.  Thus,while  some witnesses  thought  there  was an  ultimate prospect of  Afghanco-operation in the disarmament of the tribes, others held it most improbable onthe general ground that Afghanistan&apos;s main desire is to leave the present conditionof affairs as it is and to  maintain the tribes as far as possible  in  a state of independence.  To this end,  it was said,  Afghanistan deliberately encouragesour tribesmen by  the grant of subsidies and military rank and by affording themhelp in other ways.   The  present Afghan  Government cannot  forget that  theywere put in power largely by:the influence of the border tribes on both sides, andthat they might  fall from power through  the same  influence.   However much,therefore, they may desire for other reasons to  keep on good  terms with theGovernment of India, they  naturally have the  strongest motives for avoiding any action that might render them unpopular  with the tribes.  Moreover, theAfghan Government may,  we are told, have very clearly  in mind the  possibilityof using the armed tribesmen on our side of  the  border as the spearhead of anAfghan attack on India, or at any rate as a strong defensive weapon  against anattack on  Afghanistan from India.  It can at least be said that every  occurrencein the tribal areas and every form of action proposed to be taken has  to be most closely examined  with  reference to its effect on our relations with Afghanistan.                            Conflict of evidence.    47.  In the previous paragraphs we have attempted to bring out the markedconflict of evidence  with which  we  have been  confronted.   We have beenprivileged  by permission of the responsible  political  and military authoritiesto interview many of their leading  subordinates.   We wish to make it clear thatthe conflict of view is not in any way sectional, but reveals itself in all quarters.We are disturbed by the nature of the evidence we have  received and summarised,indicating  as it does the widest differences of view among important officials asto the merits or the purposes of the measures now in operation, and as  to thewisest methods of achieving the aim of the Forward Policy.   We recommend that very early  steps should be taken to review the Frontier problem in its entirety,with  the object not only  of clarifying  the policy, but  of defining the practicalobjectives to be aimed at and the methods by which they are to be reached. By thismeans it should be possible to lay down definite instructions  for  the  executionof the accepted policy in such a form  that they can be clearly understood andreadily applied by all those who are responsible for  giving  them effect.  Ourjustification  for making  this  proposal  lies in  the very large part which theproblem plays in Indian defence policy, and the difficulty of making firm plans for the future  while so much uncertainty as to commitments in Waziristan is allowed to  continue.  Moreover, it appears to us that the allotment, necessitated by existing conditions in the area,  of  such a relatively high  proportion  of thetotal  forces available for the defence of  India for the purpose  of controlling the tribes in Waziristan constitutes,  both from the financial and strategic  aspects, amost  unwelcome commitment which it  is highly desirable to reduce as early aspossible.                 Section 2. The Employment of Air Forces.    48.  There is one aspect of the defence  of  the  Western Frontier to  whichwe have given considerable attention and on which we have heard much evidence,namely, the use of  air forces.  The  subject is one that, in the past at any rate,has given rise to keen controversy, as is probably inevitable when any new weaponis brought  into use in a sphere like  the Western Frontier where land operations of some kind have been  more or less continuous for a long time.   We describein Section  3  of this  chapter the three  main methods  of  using air  forces in a primary role on the Frontier.
     49.   We have taken evidence on the subject both in London and in India.In London, we heard the views of the Air Staff and of both Army and Air force officers who  have held positions of responsibility in India during  the  conductof Frontier  operations.   In India,  we have similarly heard the views  of bothArmy and Air Force officers, and  have also obtained a considerable volume  ofevidence from political officers of various degrees of standing and experience.     50.   In London, we found a belief that there was some misuse of air forcesin India, that the air weapon had not been properly tried out, and that in many quarters its value was not recognised.  Further,  we found in India that  there isa feeling in  the Royal Air Force in India that the air resources at  the disposalof the Government have not always been employed in such a way as to secure themost advantageous  effect  by  the most economical  method.   Whatever groundsthere may have been in  the past for such criticisms,  we are satisfied that therehas been a notable advance in understanding during  the last few years,  and we hope that, so far as doubts may still persist, the  measures to which we referbelow will go far to dispel them.  Recent operations have certainly led to a morecorrect and more general appraisement of the value of air action.   It is clearlyessential that the greater understanding to which these results have contributedshould be consolidated.*     51.  Among the measures tending  to  this end we note that a Manual  ofFrontier Warfare has very recently been compiled  and is on the point of  issue.It is based on a combined study undertaken by those who have practical experienceof the various factors of the problem and sets out the agreed view of Army andAir  Headquarters, which  has been concurred in  by the political authorities, onthe principles which should govern air operations.  The fact that  it has beenpossible to reach agreement on  these  principles  demonstrates the extent of theunderstanding that now exists on questions that  have long been keenly debated.We are informed that the Manual is to be circulated at the earliest possible date;and  we consider that the circulation list might  well be extended  to include  a wide range of political officers in addition to the  standing list of A rmy and A irForce officers.  We understand  further that  certain rules governing the controlof operations exist which  should secure that any particular air  operation shallbe controlled in accordance with approved principles.     52&quot;.  A suggestion which has been made in  evidence,&apos; and  which we under -stand is already under consideration by the authorities, is that an analysis  ofair  operations  and  of their results  Should be compiled  and  circulated  inappropriate form to all the authorities concerned,  including the political authori-ties, both in India and at  Home.  This should greatly assist towards promoting the common understanding of which we have already stressed the importance.     53.  Measures of this kind, which secure that the understanding  already established shall be embodied in  a settled code of principles, will tend to enable it to survive  the possible  effects of changes  in personnel.  For  this purpose  a practice of constant consultation between the Army, Air  Force and  politicalauthorities is also of obvious value; and we have no doubt that it will continueto be given every encouragement both at the Headquarters of  the  Governmentand  elsewhere.     54.  We should make it clear at this  point that  it would not be possible  to lay down any principle to govern the difficult decision whether on any occasionit would be better to use land or air action or a combination of both.  The decision in such a matter must depend on the circumstances of each  particular case, andmust rest with the Government of India acting on the advice of the Commander-in-Chief.   The advice tendered to the latter by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,  Northern Command, is an important factor, since he is in close  touchwith  the political as well as the  military aspects of the situation.  It is clearly desirable that the advice of the local Air Force authorities should be made readily available, and that it should  carry  the weight of authority which  is necessary if full value is to be obtained from the air arm.   One requirement  is therefore that the greatest possible  continuity of contact  should be secured between theArmy and Air Force authorities.  Another is that the Air Force officers  respon-sible  for advising on air operations on the Frontier should be of suitable rank   *  Air Marshal Courtney makes a reservation on this paragraph in the Note annexed  to theReport.
and experience to enable them to discharge their responsible function.  For these purposes  ive  suggest for  consideration  that  the  Royal  Air Force  GroupCommander on the Frontier, whose post has recently been upgraded, might begiven the services of an  experienced second in command.  Such  an arrangement would enable either the  Group Commander or his deputy to maintain constanttouch, which  otherwise might  not always be  possible,  with  the  responsibleCommander, to the  benefit of both services.    55.   As a Committee, we are chiefly interested in the problem of  the proper-use of air power from the standpoint of economy in the conduct of Frontieroperations.  When the available air forces can  suitably be employed to reduce to a minimum  the  use of regular troops, we have little doubt that both money and lives would be saved.  In this  connection we have noted in  evidence that itis the accepted policy  to avoid offensive operations by land forces in circumstances which clearly indicate that the object in view can be attained by  air action alone.    56.   In conclusion, we would emphasise once more the importance of main-taining  the confidence of the different authorities concerned, whether  Army, Airor Political,  in the belief that their  own point of view will  always be fully considered and given  proper weight with those of other responsible parties.  Weare glad to have been able to indicate the large measure of common understandingthat has already been achieved; and we have made suggestions which we thinkwill promote it further.  Section 3.  The  three main methods of using  air forces in  a primary role.    57.   There are three main methods  of using air forces in a primary roleon the  Western  Frontier, namely, air blockade, proscriptive  air action,  anddestructive air action.    58.  Air  Blockade. The air  blockade is the principal  method advocated by the Royal Air Force.  The advantages of this method of exerting pressurecompared with the use of columns of regular  troops are that it can  be broughtswiftly  into effect  even in the most remote and  difficult tracts  of the Frontier,that it deliberately  avoids the infliction of casualties, that it deprives the tribesmenof the chance of striking back, and generally that it costs less.   It is an essential feature of the air  blockade  method that the Government  terms are  announcedprior to the outset  of the operations, and that the blockade continues inexorablyuntil they are  complied with.  This process, which is a form of applying  sloweconomic pressure,  may take some time, extending perhaps to two or three months or even longer.  Some political officers dislike the dictation of terms  in advancewhich is the essential characteristic of this method, on the grounds that  it isnot  always expedient for the Government of  India to  commit  themselves  toprolonged bombing operations on  the Frontier, and that once started an airblockade cannot, without a  serious loss of prestige, be discontinued before ithas  been brought  to  a successful  conclusion.   We  fully  appreciate that this objection may  on occasions be decisive; but in circumstances  suitable to its usewe are  satisfied that the air blockade constitutes a valuable, economical andhumane method of exerting  military pressure.     59.   Proscriptive air action. The advantages of the air  blockade methodalso attach  generally to that of proscriptive air action.  In the latter, however,there is  no prior  announcement of terms, and  the  Government  are thus free to discontinue air  action at any stage.  Some political officers  therefore preferthis method  to that of the air blockade.     60.   Suspension  on occasions, We  have  been informed that when airblockade or air proscriptive operations have been enforced they have, on occasions,during the  recent  operations, been suspended as a result  of  representations  bythe  political authorities.  We appreciate  that  circumstances must  occasionallyarise in which it  would become difficult  to avoid a  suspension urged by those whose duty  it is  to  keep in contact  with the  tribesmen.   Generally speaking,however, we find  the consensus of military opinion is that, should action  beprematurely suspended, there is a  grave risk not only of prejudicing the success
of the  operation  but also of  causing  avoidable casualties by  confusing the tribesmen.   The general principles underlying the methods of air blockade andproscription are now set out in the Manual of Frontier Warfare, which includes a clear  explanation of the objections to premature suspensions of operations ofthis  kind.   No doubt the more widely  the Manual can be  circulated the lesswill  be the risk  of  premature intervention due to misunderstanding of theprinciples.     61.  Destructive air  action. The  object  of  the  third method,  that ofdestructive air action, is to inflict punishment for past misdeeds by the destructionof the tribesmen&apos;s material possessions.  It does not  aim at inflicting casualties;and, as in the case of air blockade and  proscriptive  operations, warning noticesare invariably issued to ensure  that the village or villages are evacuated beforeoperations are begun. While the avoidance of casualties is  an integral feature of all three methods, destructive air action is the only one which relies  for its effect upon  the destruction of property.  On that account, while  the method isuseful both as ia deterrent and as a means of achieving a political  or tacticalresult, it  is the least easy of the three to defend on grounds of humanity.     62.  We  have been impressed by the view  which has  been  put before usin evidence that owing  to the  great value of air forces on the Frontier,  it is most important to  avoid  any  action which might  give  rise to  allegations ofinhumanity, however unjustified,  and  so  result in the imposition  of further restrictions.  We  feel sure that these considerations are fully appreciated andthat  the use of destructive air  action will continue to  be  closely watched  fromthe standpoint to  which we refer.     Opinions as  to  the unrestricted  use of air  forces in  a primary  role.     63.   We  draw  attention here to a further point.  Somewhat unexpectedlywe have  found appreciable support for the more  drastic use of air  forces in operations  in tribal  territory.  The argument was that the  application of suchmethods can alone compel the respect of the tribesmen and  secure lasting peace on the  Frontier.  It was, indeed, suggested that for this purpose the practiceof issuing warning notices should be discontinued; in other words, that the main object  should be  the infliction  of casualties, despite the  fact  that  this  wouldbe directly opposed to the accepted principles  governing the employment of airforces  in a primary role.  We regard it  as quite  out of the question that in these days there could be any relaxation of the  long-established  restrictionson the use of air forces  on  the Frontier  in time  of peace.  We have thought it necessary,  however, to call  attention to these views because,  if they are at all widely  held,  the sooner they can be dispelled the  better. CHAPTER  4. PRINCIPLES  GOVERNING  THE SCALES OF THE FORCES,  AND  THE   FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE  BRITISH  AND INDIAN GOVERNMENTS.      64.  Before discussing the re-organisation of the forces, we regard it as very necessary to  consider in  the light of  the strategical  situation what principle should govern the general scale of the armed forces (Army, Air and Navy) to be maintained in India, and how India&apos;s responsibility  in this matter  should be viewed.      65.  Hitherto the accepted principle  has been, in  the words of  the  Garran Report of  1933, that &quot;  the broad lines  of  division between Indian and Imperial responsibility for defence should be that India assumed  responsibility  for the &apos; minor clanger &apos;  of the maintenance  of internal security and defence  against the  border tribes and  against Afghanistan, and  that Great Britain assumed responsibility for the &apos; major danger &apos; of an attack by a Great Power upon India, or upon the Empire through  India &quot;  (paragraph 19 of  the Report, endorsed by a majority of the Tribunal in paragraph 20).      66.  The assumptions on which the Garran Tribunal proceeded were derived from the discussions which took place  in the Cabinet Committee  on the Defence of India in 1928, and which were centred on the possibility of Russian aggression through Afghanistan.   It was  with reference to  this possibility that the formula
&apos;&apos; an attack by a Great Power upon India, or upon the Empire through India &apos;&apos;was used.  It was not based, and did not purport to be based, on a comprehensivestrategical review of the situation as a whole.  The possibilities of other forms of attack existed at that time, though they were more remote than they are to-day;but the principle  we have quoted did  not take them into account.  It  seems doubtful, therefore, whether the principle was intended, or could be held, to have auniversal application,  even at the  time when it was accepted by the Tribunal.Since then, profound  changes have  taken  place  which  still further affect itsapplicability.    67.  In 1933 the world situation, and the Imperial Defence problem whichit presented, were radically different.  The German Navy was still limited to thestrength allowed by the Versailles Treaty, and the German Air Force,  judged bymodern standards,  was non-existent.  Italy had not then achieved her  presentmilitary strength,  and our  traditional friendly  relations  with  that  countrycontinued  to  be  an important  safeguard  in  our  Imperial Defence  system.Although Japan had assumed an aggressive attitude against China, our relationswith her remained friendly.  The memory of the former, alliance had by no meansentirely faded, and the line of action she is  now pursuing had not taken definiteshape.  Great Britain had  allowed her defences to fall  into  arrears,  but itwas  generally believed that her  forces  were sufficient  for  their Imperialresponsibilities.    68.  The  outlook  to-day is recognised everywhere as completely changed.The  Tripartite Agreement between Germany, Italy and Japan has  created a potential  military  combination  against the Empire of  a  menacing  character.These  momentous   changes have seriously  increased the vulnerability of  theEmpire, as many of its constituent parts are now  realising;  but Indian publicopinion has  lagged far behind.   Yet  India in  particular has  become more vulnerable to external  attack.  For instance, it is  by no means improbable that,owing to the circumstances of war,  a considerable period might elapse  before theNavy could establish command  of the Indian  Ocean; and  during this  periodIndia&apos;s coasts and her trade might be exposed to attacks.  The fact must be facedthat  Great Britain may not now be in a position  to guarantee India&apos;s externalsecurity in the same measure as in the past.    69.  On these  grounds we consider that the  distinction drawn in the GarranReport between the &quot; major &quot; and  the &quot; minor &quot; danger cannot now be accepted,as a valid or  practicable  criterion.  The general principle  that we  would  putforward in its place is that  the forces maintained in India shotdd be adequatenot merely for the narrower purposes of purely local defence, but  also to assist in ensuring her security against the external  threats that we have described;  and,further, that India should acknowledge that her responsibility cannot in her own interests be safely limited  to the local defence of  her land frontiers and coasts.We are not suggesting that  the forces in India should, or could, be made self-sufficient for these wider purposes.  We do not suggest that India  should be solely responsible for her external defence; nor do we suggest that she should necessarilybear the entire financial burden of the armed forces kept in India at any time.But quite clearly in our view the principle  on which the financial arrangements between the two Governments should be based is that India should  bear some share in a joint responsibility for her external security.  It may not be practicable togive full  effect to  the principle  so long as financial stringency dominates theIndian  situation.   Nevertheless,  we  think  it of  the first importance that theprinciple should be accepted and widely recognised, and that reasonable effectgiven to it so far as is financially possible.    70.  This principle of joint responsibility is stated in a  somewhat differentform in paragraph 61 of the  Pownall Sub-Committee&apos;s Report:          &quot; The changed strategical  situation  throughout the  world and  the    development of modern  armaments, particularly air forces, have  brought    into prominence the need for India, in  her  own interest,  to play  a more    important part in the defence of the vital areas on our Imperial communica-    tions in the Middle and Far East.&quot;
In  this connection the  concern  of the Sub-Committee was to find the most advantageous disposition of the total forces that could be made available in theEast.  For that purpose they recommended, inter alia, &quot; the unconditional alloca-tion of one Indian division to His Majesty&apos;s Government as a strategic reserve for use wherever  and whenever  required &quot; (paragraph 36).  Their  underlying-conception was that the  components of the  &quot; Imperial Reserve Division &quot; couldbe reckoned as surplus to India&apos;s own requirements, and could therefore be treated in various ways as something distinct from the rest of the forces maintained in India.    71.  If our premise is  accepted, this conception of the &quot; Imperial ReserveDivision &quot; will need to be modified. In the first place the forces that can be madeavailable from India to assist in the -protection of her external interests should, inour opinion, form  an integral part of the forces in India as a whole.  We discusselsewhere  the application of this principle to the Air and Naval Forces as wellas to the Army.  It is a part of our  proposals that the land forces should form as now a  composite whole, and that they should be modernised  practicallythroughout on a scale which will secure the degree of mobility and striking power which are required for modern warfare.  We would, therefore, deprecate the useof a  title  such as &quot; the Imperial Reserve Division,&quot;  first,  because the term&quot; Imperial &quot; implies  a distinction between Imperial and Indian interests whichwe do not  admit in this  context, and, secondly,  because the  title itself implies a kind  of segregation which we believe would be unsound, both in principle and practice.  It is true that a part of the composite land forces would be equippedin some respects on a higher scale than the remainder.  But although the number and character of the  formations in this part would remain constant, the actualunits and personnel would be continually interchanged with that of  the rest ofthe Army.   The difference in equipment would in no way detract from the natureof the Army as a composite body, and would be no more than a recognition of theneed  for India to equip her forces so as to enable India to  take her  share in defending her interests wherever these might lie.    72.  In the second place, there is the question of the nature of the obligationto make such a force  available.  The  Pownall Sub-Committee recommended thatits allocation should be unconditional, and the Chiefs of Staffs laid special stress on this proposal  in paragraph 15 of their Report.   As  a result  of  further discussion, however, which  is summarised in paragraphs 5 to 7 of the second report of the Cabinet Committee,* dated the 29th July, 1938, the Cabinet finallyendorsed the conclusion  that  &quot; the degree of obligation on the Government ofIndia to place  these troops at the  disposal of the  Home Government should bemade somewhat more definite,  and expressed more  precisely than  is at presentthe case with reinforcements from India, but should fall short of an unconditionalobligation &quot; (Second  Report,  paragraph 8).  It seems to us  that  much  of  thedifficulty that has  arisen in the past in this connection may be attributed to thesharp   distinction  that  has  been  drawn  between  Imperial   and  Indianresponsibilities.  It was  assumed that all  contingencies other than  those coveredby the definition of the &quot; minor danger &quot; represented an  Imperial responsibility;and therefore that  the Home Government alone were concerned with the prepara-tion  of plans  for  dealing  with such contingencies.  The recognised procedure was that on any  given occasion they would  ask  the Government of India toco-operate if feasible, and that thereupon the Government of India would consider in isolation, so to  speak, whether conditions in India would permit of co-opera-tion.   This almost suggests that the two Governments worked  in water-tightcompartments.  In practice, of course, there is  close consultation in advance aswell as at the crucial moment; but the fact remains that the Government of india have neither claimed  nor admitted any responsibility  in this connection beyond that of deciding whether forces can be spared from India in the circumstancesof any particular case.  In any case the hypothesis of a conditional obligation is somewhat  unreal,  since  in a  major crisis the Government  of  India  would naturally  strain every nerve to help  and in theory could be ordered to do so.Nevertheless, so long as the obligation remains in form conditional, there is greatpractical difficulty  in making effective plans in advance.[18631]* C.I.D. Paper No. 198-D.
    73.  With our conception of the scope of India&apos;s responsibilities the matterpresents a different aspect.  We assume  that India would normally have, overand above the forces regarded as the minimum necessary for keeping her frontiersand coasts intact and ensuring internal order, forces available for what we have called the external defence of India, which we regard as a matter of common and direct  concern  to both Governments.  That being so,  the &quot;obligation&quot;  on theGovernment of India is no longer a contract to perform something outside the sphere of their normal duties; it becomes an integral part of those duties. we assume further that both Governments would collaborate in preparing plans which, as regards India, would take account not only of India&apos;s local defence and internal Security,  but  also  of  the  threats external  to,  and perhaps  not evenlocalised near, her frontiers and coasts, instead of treating them in isolation. Theproblem would then be to decide, as far as possible in advance, how in any givenset of circumstances the forces in India could best be employed in the defence ofIndia in this wider and fuller sense.  The more completely the defence planning of the two Governments  can be co-ordinated and  merged  in  the general WarPlans, the less will be the need for defining in any general formula the degree ofobligation resting on the Government of India.    74.  We contemplate that, as regards the  employment  outside India of theforces  available for the external defence of India, the general War Plans wouldprovide only for contingencies involving  a threat  to India&apos;s external security,and therefore that in the  preparation of these plans the two Governments would determine by agreement as regards  each  particular contingency covered by the plans whether or not India&apos;s external security would be threatened. At the sametime,  we recognise that  there  may be occasions, as in the past, on which theGovernment  of India will be able  and  willing to make  forces available forpurposes going beyond the external defence of India.    75.  While the availability of the forces on these occasions would to someextent justify the continuance of the subsidy now paid by the British Governmentto India under the Garran Award, we recommend  its continuance  on other grounds.  We do not wish it to be thought that,  in recommending  that india should acknowledge a responsibility  in the matter of her external defence, weare adhering to the doctrine of mutually exclusive spheres of responsibility, and merely recommend  that the  line between them should be drawn at  a differentpoint.  We believe it, indeed, to be both unprofitable and impracticable to attemptto delimit respective spheres or shares of this joint responsibility.  We advocate the doctrine  of joint responsibility  so far as the external  security of India isconcerned; and this involves some sharing of the financial burden.  At the sametime, we think that it is impossible to evaluate in terms of actual costs the degreein which each party should at any  time contribute to the common  cause.  Inaccordance with the principles on Avhich the relations between the Governmentsof Great Britain and of  India have been based,  the Government of India mustbe responsible for the administration of all  the  armed forces  situated in india for her local defence and for purposes covered by the joint responsibility, andthey must therefore have full financial control over the expenditure necessary fortheir maintenance.   // at any time there are forces held for the purposes coveredby the joint responsibility,, a contribution should, in our opinion, be made  by theBritish Government to India, and the method  of the Garran Award  offers,  wethink, the best possible solution.  Taking all the factors which we have discussedinto account, we consider that, on the basis of  the proposals which we make forthe strength and composition of the forces (Army, Air and Navy) to  be held inIndia, it would be right to continue the payment of a  subsidy  to India; and  wedo not regard the fixing of the subsidy at the  higher level  of  2,000,000 a yearprovisionally promised by His Majesty&apos;s Government as unreasonable in existingcircumstances.   We come to this  conclusion  without prejudice to  any fullerapplication of the doctrine of joint responsibility which may eventually be found possible.  It follows from what we have said  that, if forces held in India forthe purposes covered by  the  joint responsibility are  used outside India in  anemergency affecting India&apos;s external security, their ordinary maintenance charges should continue to  be borne by Iridia.  The apportionment between Imperial and indian funds  of  the extraordinary  or &quot;extra&quot;  cost of such  forces while so employed should be a matter for agreement by  the two  Governments at the time,having regard  to all the circumstances of the emergency.
    76.  We have referred in paragraph 73 to the  importance of consultation and co-ordination in the matter  of the plans formulated in India and at home for the use of armed forces in the  defence of India in the event of  war.   Werecommend that any plans for this purpose  proposed  by the  two  governments should,  as a matter of course, be the subject  of the closest consultation  betweenthe defence authorities in India and the Committee  of Imperial Defence before their  approval  by the two Governments.  We understand that the Governmentof India would welcome arrangements to give effect to this recommendation.
PART II.- THE REORGANISATION PROPOSALS.                           CHAPTER 5-PREFACE.     77.  We now come to our proposals for the  reorganisation of  the  defence forces in India.  They naturally fall under three headings relating to the Army,the Air and the Naval Forces respectively, and we present them in that order.We have added a separate section dealing with Coast Defence.  It will be under-stood that the proposals under  the  different headings  are  closely connected inmany respects, and that they are intended to form a composite whole.     78.  While  discussions were proceeding in London, in the Summer  of 1938the  Commander-in-Chief had  initiated a new and comprehensive review ofIndia&apos;s local defence requirements by the General Staff in India and his navaland  air advisers.  The results of the review were embodied  in proposals for there organisation of the local defence forces and were presented to us in evidenceby the Commander-in-Chief and his advisers.  We have kept in the closest touchwith the Commander-in-Chief, and as a result of our joint consultations several important modifications have been made in the proposals by him.  For the sake of convenience we shall refer throughout our Report to these proposals.  All ourreferences  to them and  our explanations of them  relate to the proposals somodified.   Our recommendations are in the main based on the proposals,  and wethink it only right that we should record our appreciation of the g^eat assistance the Commander-in-Chief and his advisers have  afforded us in forming our ownconclusions on the problem.  There are several features of the proposals whichwe consider should be further considered. They do not  alter the basic characteror affect the efficiency of the scheme of reorganisation and are largely directed toreduction of cost.  We have not,  as regards these features,  recommended that theproposals should be  modified.   In  many cases further  investigation  by theCommander-in-Chief  and his advisers would  be necessary before  conclusionscould be come to on them.  We have, therefore, been content to recommend that before effect is given to the proposals as a whole, the  matters  we have drawn attention to should be fully reconsidered  by the Commander-in-Chief.     79.  We have already explained in Chapter 4  of our Report our reasons for modifying the conception of an Imperial Reserve in India and have recommendedthat the defence forces of India should contain an element as  an integral partof those forces available for the purposes covered by what we regard  as the joint responsibility of the two Governments for India&apos;s external defence.  In addition,therefore,  to the  forces  required  for India&apos;s local  defence covered  by theCommander-in-Chief&apos;s proposals, we have dealt with the  provision of forces togive effect to our own recommendations as regards external defence.   As we shallconstantly  have  to refer to  this element in  connection with all three  defence services, it will be convenient to give it a short title.  We propose therefore to speak of it hereafter as the &quot; External Defence Forces &quot; so far as all the  defence forces are concerned, and &quot; External Defence Troops &quot; so far as the Army aloneis concerned.  It will be understood that these are  no more than short titleswhich should be  interpreted in  the  light of  the  fuller  and  more accuratedescription we have given.              CHAPTER 6. THE REORGANISATION  OF  THE ARMY.                          Section  1. Introduction.Summary of the earlier discussions.     80.  We begin by recalling the general impressions we had formed as theresult of our work in London, and especially of our study of the Chiefs  of staff report of the 2nd July, 1938, and the connected  documents to which attention is drawn in the opening words of our terms of reference.  The report of Major-General Pownall&apos;s Sub-Committee assumed as its  basis the accepted division ofthe Army in India into three main categories; the Field Army comprising mterms of Cavalry and Infantry three Cavalry brigades and 3  Infantry divisions
together with army troops; the Covering Troops, comprising 4 Cavalry regimentsand 53 Infantry battalions; the Internal Security Troops, comprising 5 cavalry regiments and  46 Infantry battalions;  and in addition certain  Coast defence units, comprising in addition to artillery and  searchlight  personnel 7 infantry battalions which were, in fact, included in the  Internal  Security  Troops but were allotted a dual  role between  Internal Security and  Coast  Defence.   the role of the Field Army was to undertake offensive operations against Afghanistanin the event of hostilities; and that of the Covering Troops to  assist the civil authorities in  their  control of administered and  unadministered areas on theWestern Frontier at all times, and to protect the lines of communication of the.Field Army in  the event of active  operations beyond the Frontier.    81.  The   General Staff in India  had  stated  that on the  then  existingassumptions as to the role of the Army in India it would be impossible in their view  to reduce the  Covering Troops, save,  perhaps,  for  a small  exception(Appendix &quot; D &quot; to the Sub-Committee&apos;s  report).  They had further stated thatit would be unjustifiable to effect any reductions in the number of British troopsallotted to Internal Security beyond those already contemplated  in the summer of 1938, which included  the withdrawal  of  one British Cavalry regiment and four British Infantry battalions (Appendix &quot; E &quot;).   The withdrawal of  these units has already been carried out.    82.  The General Staff of India had stated, -moreover, that, assuming thatthe Government of India were prepared  to place the equivalent  of one division from  the existing Field  Army at the disposal of  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfor use in emergencies, the remaining strength of the Field Army,  after providingnecessary reinforcements for  the  Covering Troops, would not be sufficient  for offensive land  operations against  Afghanistan on  the scale previously contem-plated  (Appendix &quot; F&quot;).  In accepting these assumptions the  Pownall Sub-Committee noted that the Government of Indians undertaking to hold the divisionat the disposal  of His Majesty&apos;s Government was contingent on effect being givento certain measures  of reorganisation and re-equipment of the Army in  India(paragraph 33  (iii)).    83.  The main feature of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report as regards the  army was  the provision for an Imperial Reserve Division, on the general grounds that &apos;&apos; on the  present scale  of her defence  forces India  is less under-insuredthan are other parts of the British Empire &quot;  (paragraph 28 of their Report),and that &apos;&apos; India is the area strategically best  suited East of the Mediterraneanbasin for the location of &quot; such a reserve (paragraph 62).  The  Chiefs of Staffin paragraphs 16 and 17 of their Report emphasised that  &quot;since the   forcesearmarked as Imperial reinforcements  will in most cases be opposed by  forcesof a  first-class military  Power,  it is  essential that  they should be equippedon a scale which will  enable them to meet the enemy  on level terms,&quot; and that,as recommended by the Pownall Sub-Committee, they should be &apos;&apos; organised and equipped on the same lines as the Imperial Forces alongside whom they willhave to fight in war.&quot;    84.  In regard to modernisation, the Government of India forwarded withtheir letter  of  the 9th February,  1938, a list  of measures considered necessaryto bring the defence  forces in India as a whole  up to date on the  basis of theorganisation then existing.  The  need  for modernisation  of the defence  forcesin India was emphasised throughout the discussions that took place last summer,as, for instance, in paragraph 18 of the Chiefs  of Staffs Report and particularlyin paragraph 25 (i) of the second  report of the Cabinet Committee which  stated&quot;we are convinced  that early action to place India&apos;s  defence organisation ona more up to date and satisfactory basis  is most essential.&quot; We  as a Committeehave regarded  this statements a mandate which, as, indeed, is implied in our terms of reference, must govern the lines of our  enquiry and our recommendations.Indepedent  investigations in India.     85.  The  review of  India&apos;s defence  requirements  undertaken by the Com-mander-in-Chief assumed, as regards the Army that in the event of an Empirewar in which  Afghanistan was involved, the Army would act on the defensive,and that, in these circumstances, unless  the situation was particularly favourable,
no large-scale offensive operations would be undertaken against the tribes onthe Indian side of the Durand Line, or across  it against Afghan troops andtribes.  On this assumption it approached the problem from a new standpoint.Instead of taking as its basis the existing units and formations of the Army,it set out to arrive at a purely objective estimate of the  minimum forces needed for the strictly limited and local roles of holding the Frontier against  Afghanaggression, keeping the Frontier tribesmen in order, and maintaining internal security, together with a measure of coast defence and  ground defence against air attack.  The forces thus built  up were to be adequate,  though no more thanadequate, to fulfil all these roles simultaneously in time of war.   They containedno margin of reserve for other purposes. By reason of this fact,  and on accountof the increased  mobility, and striking power afforded  by  modernisation, theywere found to be less than the total of the existing units.   Of the surplus thusremaining, a part could, if  so decided, be held  in  India  as  a reserve at  thedisposal of His Majesty&apos;s  Government; the rest  being withdrawn or disbandedexcept in so far  as further  employment  might  be  found for  them overseas.The whole conception  rested on a basis of  comprehensive modernisation whichwas the main justification for the reductions proposed in the forces now allotted to the roles just  described.  Actually, the units  which it was suggested mightbe held as an Imperial Reserve amounted to the equivalent of a modern  divisionwith one Cavalry Light Tank regiment.  While, therefore, the method of approach was new, the  conclusions did not  differ materially in this respect from thoseof the Pownall Sub-Committee and the Chiefs of Staff Committee.The choice between &quot;homogeneous&quot; and &quot;specialised&quot;  forces.    86.  At the  outset, however,  there is  a fundamental  issue to be settled.It was suggested to us in evidence in London  that the maintenance of a homo-geneous Army in India is not really  best suited to Indian conditions.  Thesuggestion was that it  might be simpler, cheaper, and more effective to maintainseparate specialised  forces for such purposes as  Frontier watch and ward and internal Security; and so to avoid the need for employing highly organised and equipped troops on duties for which different  and lower scales of organisationand equipment would be adequate.  The argument found support in some quarters in India; and prima facie it has certain attractions.  But we do not think itwill bear close examination.   The personnel of such separate forces would  notbe interchangeable, and, consequently, great practical difficulties would be met with as regards the  drafting and training of  units in the various  components.Further, the constitution of forces of which the component parts cannot readily be interchanged is unsound from the point of view of  elasticity and economy of force.  Moreover,  such forces, owing to the  fact that  recruits have to be specially attracted by  the offer of high pay and expensive privileges,  are  not likely to prove economical in comparison with general purpose troops.  specialisations-tion would apparently involve the conversion of the whole, or the greater part, ofthe regular Indian Army, at any rate  into groups  of  forces which would be incapable of operating anywhere outside their local spheres.  Even if the principleof maintaining specialised forces were held unobjectionable in itself, there wouldbe special difficulties  in  regard to the Internal Security  problem.  We have examined the  matter with some care, because it has been suggested that in this field,  at any rate, financial savings might be effected by substituting some formof gendarmerie for the regular troops now employed on or earmarked for internal security duties.    87.   The  objections to the creation of a British gendarmerie for  this purposeare clearly stated in Appendix &quot; E &quot; to the  Pownall Sub-Committee&apos;s Report,and we fully endorse them. Some of these objections would apply equally to theformation of an Indian gendarmerie.  We have  been advised that the maintenanceby the Central Government of military police forces similar in character to those employed in  certain Provinces could  not  be brought  into effect  without an amendment of the Constitution Act, and, further, that such an amendment wouldhave  to be regarded as a  matter  of major political  importance.   There is  thepossible alternative that for reasons of economy units of  the Indian  Army mightbe earmarked  exclusively for Internal Security  purposes and equipped on a lowerscale than the rest of the regular troops, while continuing to form part of &quot; HisMajesty&apos;s forces borne on the Indian Establishment &quot; and thus remaining under
Central Control.   The disadvantages of such  a differentiation within the Armyare serious enough, as we show below; but in any case we are convinced that inpresent circumstances it would be too dangerous to weaken the effectiveness ofthe forces which are the ultimate guarantee, behind the Provincial police, of themaintenance of law and  order.  On  all these grounds we have  thought itunprofitable to pursue the matter further.The general case for uniform modernisation.    88.  We have dealt at this point with the matter of specialised forces partly because it must, we think, be disposed of before we can put forward any generalscheme of reorganisation, and partly also because the considerations we have justset out apply in  some degree to  the question of modeimisation.  The PownallSub-Committee contemplated that the units earmarked for the Imperial ReserveDivision should be modernised on the Home scale,  and stated that &apos;&apos; some degreeof modernisation of the remainder of the Army in India is imperative,&quot; on thegrounds set out in  paragraph 42 of their Report.   It will  be seen  that  our recommendations,  following in this respect the conclusions of the General Staff inIndia, go further and propose a scale of modernisation that would be practicallyuniform through  the Army in  India.  We have  already  given  reasons  inparagraphs 70 and 71 of our Report for abandoning the conception of an ImperialReserve which  would be segregated  from the remainder of the forces in India,and for treating the whole of those  forces as a single entity.  Even  apart fromthat,  great  difficulty would,  in our  view, be created if  there  were  any markeddistinction between the types of equipment in different parts of the forces.  It isclear  that the British troops, at any rate, must be modernised  so as to make the personnel and units readily interchangeable between India and elsewhere.  Butit is an accepted practice, which we see no reason to dispute, that British and indian troops  on  the  Indian establishment are usually  organised in mixedformations.  If  the modernisation  of  Indian Army units lagged appreciablybehind, the difficulties, both tactical and administrative,  of  commanding andadministering highly modernised and less completely modernised units in the sameformation  would be so great as  seriously to impair its  training in peace and efficiency for war.   If,  despite the general advantages of the mixed formationsystem, an  attempt were  made  to  redistribute  units  so as  to form separatehomogeneous British and Indian brigades throughout, the expense of constructingnew barrack accommodation would  be almost  prohibitive.   In any case,  thesuggestion that Indian Army units should be provided with an inferior type of equipment would  arouse grave political objection in India and would in itselftend to weaken the confidence and morale of the regular Indian Army.   this argument is not affected by our proposal that a part of the Army, which would beavailable as a reserve for external defence, should be equipped in some respectson a higher scale  than the remainder.  In the first place, the difference in scale of equipment, as we have pointed out in paragraph 71,  would not detract fromthe composite nature of the Army as a whole, and, secondly, it has always  been contemplated  that  a reserve  of this  nature  should  include a   number  ofIndian units.    89.  We have indicated that there are  three alternatives;  first, to createseparate specialised forces, or, secondly, to modernise a part  of the army  in amarkedly less degree than the rest; or, thirdly, to modernise the whole with  suchminor variations as will not affect the general level of efficiency.  We regard thefirst as wholly  impracticable, and the second as  open to grave objection.   Wetherefore have no hesitation in recommending the third as providing the only realsolution of the problem.          Section  2. Scope  of the  Commander-in-Chief s proposals.    90.  The general purport of the proposals regarding the Army is     (i) to assess the forces required as a safe minimum in war for  the limited           local roles described in paragraph 85, on the  assumption that the           whole of these forces will be modernised;    (ii) to  modernise them accordingly on  a scale  generally resembling  that           adopted for troops on the Imperial Establishment;
(iii)  to distribute these modernised forces on the new basis explained below,       which  would  replace  the existing division into  &quot; Field Army,&quot;       &quot; Covering Troops,&quot; and &quot; Internal Security Troops &quot;;(iv) out of the surplus that will then remain, to retain a number of troops       which will be available for purposes other than the limited local roles;(v) to modernise this  number  of troops on a somewhat higher scale than is       proposed for the forces required for local defence;(vi) to deal with  any balance that  may  still remain,  by withdrawing  the       British units, and reducing the Indian units for which  employment       cannot be provided in overseas garrisons.    91.  The general effect of these proposals, illustrated by reference to Cavalryand Infantry units is as follows :i Type of Unit.	Present Number.	To be retained and modernised for local defence.

(2)  Including the two battalions temporarily stationed in Hong Kong  and  Taiping, but excluding the battalion forming part of the permanent garrison of Hong Kong.    92.  The new  basis of distribution referred to in paragraph 90 (iii)  is asfollows :     (i) Frontier Defence Troops, for the defence of the Western Frontier against           external aggression and for the control of the tribes within the Durand           Line.   They ,are organised to provide  for the permanent Frontier           garrisons  and also for a reserve to be held at the disposal of the           Northern Command.    (ii) Internal Security Troops, for the preservation in war  of  law and order           and the protection of  the  strategic railways  forming  the lines of           communication on which the  defence forces must depend  in war;   (iii) Coast Defence Troops, for the defence of the principal ports;   (iv) A General  Reserve, containing sufficient troops to cope with an unfore-           seen emergency and to reinforce the troops in the remaining categories           if need  be.  It also includes 3 mobile anti-aircraft batteries for Air           Defence.  These are distinct from the localised anti-aircraft defences           which we propose for the principal ports in Chapter 9.    93.  It is a feature of the. proposals that the organisation and  composition ofthe Army should be such as will fit it to operate in Asiatic theatres of war, ofwhich the military  characteristics are great distances, limited means of communi-cation and difficulties of supply,  which usually preclude the employment of  largearmies and call for a high degree  of mobility.  It is therefore  held that higherformations, such as Army Corps and Divisions, are not likely to be needed in amodernised Army of India, and that it is unnecessary to maintain in peace largerpermanent formations than Cavalry or Infantry brigades.   Any higher groupingswhich might be required for a specific task in  war could be specially created and organised in accordance with the particular needs of the moment as a &quot; Force.&apos;&apos;      *    94.  At the outset it may be convenient to describe very briefly the types and functions of the various modernised units to which we shall have to refer.
[18631]    British and Indian  Cavalry Light Tank Regiments:  to be equipped withlight tanks and a proportion of armoured carriers for reconnaissance, each tankcontaining one medium machine gun and either a tank mortar or a 2-pounder gun.These units would  form the mobile armoured striking portion  of the general reserve.    Indian Cavalry A armoured Regiments:  to contain one squadron of light tanks and two squadrons of armoured cars.  They are intended for employment  on theWestern  Frontier and primarily designed for reconnaissance, for co-operationwith Infantry and for convoy protection duties.    Indian Cavalry Motor Regiments: to be provided with motor transport forthe conveyance of the  personnel who would usually operate on foot.  They  wouldbe highly mobile units,  strong  in fire  power, and capable  of reinforcing theFrontier  Defence or the Internal Security troops, or of co-operating with LightTank Cavalry regiments.    British and Indian Field Artillery Regiments: to be equipped with sixteen25-pounder  guns each,  towed by wheeled tractors.  The  whole unit is  to bemechanised.    Field Park  Companies and  Field Companies, Sappers  and Miners: to havefully mechanised first-line transport and to be equipped with mechanical  powertools.    British and Indian Infantry Battalions: to  be armed  with rifles and to be equipped with 45 light  machine guns,  and  four 2-inch mortars.  They  wouldhave  fully  mechanised first-line transport,  except that  the majority of the battalions stationed on the Western Frontier would  retain a number of unitequipment pack mules and have a smaller number of mechanical vehicles.   Theywould not have armoured carriers.    Details are given in Appendix IV referred to later.    95.  In formulating the proposals,  the General Staff considered in the firstplace the needs of the units required for the  General Reserve which must be themost mobile and flexible.  The formation  of a General Reserve, whose functionshave already been briefly described, is an essential feature of the scheme as awhole.  Apart from  certain Indian States Forces, referred to  later, the mainconstituent of the General Reserve would  be a Regular Army element capable of producing a highly mobile striking force.  For this and the other purposes forwhich the General Reserve is designed it would include!       (i)  Cavalry Light Tank units, to provide mobile armoured  formations for           local counter strokes to  relieve pressure on the Frontier Defence           troops;     (ii)  Cavalry Motor units, to provide  mobile formations strong in fire power           and capable of operating with armoured formations, or to reinforce           Frontier Defence and Internal Security troops;    (iii)  Infantry components to provide formations capable of  operating in           terrain unsuitable for mechanised troops and to provide units for the           reinforcement of the  Frontier Defence and Internal Security troops;    (iv)  Artillery,  Engineer,  Signal  and  Administrative units  capable  of           operating  with the troops mentioned above.    The various components of the General Reserve would thus  be  capable. ofbeing combined into a balanced force of high mobility and  striking power whichwould be suitable for carrying out a rapid counter-offensive against the Afghanarmy should the need arise.    96.  The principal role of the Frontier Defence troops is, in war, to maintainthe existing situation in the face  of  tribal aggression, and to  resist Afghaninvasion; and, in peace, to meet the daily requirements of watch and ward in theunadministered tribal areas.  For these purposes it is proposed that the FrontierDefence  troops  should  include  Cavalry  armoured units, Field, Mountain and medium  Artillery, and Infantry battalions, in addition to  Engineer and  Signalunits.
    97.  The units allotted to Internal Security consist wholly of Cavalry Motorregiments and  Infantry battalions.  The main requirement in this  case is theprovision of  mobile man power  rather than concentrated fire power;  and this is reflected in the two types selected.                           Administrative  services.    98.  Modernisation must also extend to the administrative services, includingthe medical  service, supply and transport service and the ordnance  and repairorganisations.  It is  proposed that field ambulances serving mechanised forma-tions, including those with mechanised first-line transport, should  themselves bemechanised,  although on the Western Frontier ambulances  for  use  in  roadlesscountry  will need pack  animal transport,  and  in  addition a small  pool ofambulance animals will be needed to  enable mechanised ambulances to collectcasualties which may occur a short distance away from the  road.   The supplyand transport service will be modernised on the  same lines.  We deal in detail with the mechanical repair organisation in paragraph 127 below.                        Detailed  distribution of units.    99.  The detailed  distribution of units between  the new  categories is asfollows : 	Frontier Defence						Troops.		Coast	Internal	General Reserve.	Type of Unit.

As already explained, the provision of forces for the purposes described above leaves a disposable surplus.  The following table shows in detail the extentto which it is proposed that the surplus units might be absorbed in a reserve for
purposes other than the local defence of India and the extent to which they wouldhave to be withdrawn from India or reduced in India : 		To be absorbed	To be	To be reducedType of Unit.

Issues raised by foregoing proposals.     101.  It is  clear that the proposals, as we have so far  described them, raiseissues of major  importance, such  as the adequacy of the forces for their variouspurposes, particularly that of Internal Security; the method of treating what was originally termed the Imperial Reserve;  and the  formidable  problems involvedin the  reduction of so  large  a  number of effective units of the Indian Army, inaddition to the problems involved in the disposal of British units which would be withdrawn  from India.   We discuss  these  issues  in the next  Section  before proceeding to deal in detail with the proposed organisation  and equipment of theArmy.        Section 3. Comments on the proposed Strength and Distribution.The Frontier  Defence Troops and the  General Reserve.     102.  We have examined  the proposed composition of the Frontier defence troops and the  General Reserve respectively.   As  regards the  former,  thepermanent garrisons of the four Frontier Military Districts remain  substantiallyas  they were, while the  troops  forming the 1st Division  (formerly  allotted tothe  Field  Army) have now been  set aside  to form a reserve  at  the disposal ofthe  Northern Command,  for the  reinforcement of  the Frontier Defence Troopsin  the  event of serious tribal  disturbance  or  war  with Afghanistan.   Theexperience of the last  five years has shown that these troops  have had on many occasions  to be used for this  purpose, and the proposal merely gives practicalrecognition to this fact.*  The composition and strength of the General Reserve    * A comparison of the strength of the Frontier Defence troops (including the reserve at thedisposal of the Northern Command)  with that of the Covering Troops as given in Appendix A tothe report of the Pownall Sub-Committee, shows that the net main increases in  the strength of.the former as compared with the latter are:  -        12  Field Artillery  batteries.         3  Mountain Artillery batteries.        11  Infantry battalions.These units include 8 Field Artillery batteries formerly belonging to the 1st  Division and 4stationed in Baluchistan which were originally allotted to the 2nd Division and which have nowbeen merged in  the Frontier Defence Troops.    The 3  Mountain Artillery batteries formed part of the 1st Divisional Artillery and have nowbeen placed in Northern Command Reserve.  The increase of 11 Infantry battalions is accountedfor by the addition of the 12 battalions (i.e., the equivalent of the infantry of the  1st Division) tothe Frontier Defence Troops, and the reduction  therefrom  of  one battalion now forming  theChitral garrison, which is to be withdrawn.
appear to be adequate for the purposes for which it is designed.  Apart  fromits availability as a reinforcement of the Frontier Defence Troops,  it represents a valuable insurance against any risk of grave disaffection of a widespread naturewithin India.  We recommend that the proposals as regards both these categoriesshould be accepted.Internal Security.     103.  We have necessarily  given particular  attention to  the problem ofInternal Security.  There is naturally a wide range of conditions  under whichthe problem may arise and must be considered.  At the one extreme is the problemof internal security under ordinary peace conditions when no emergency measures are  in force either as regards the Frontier or  in respect of war.  In this casethe  regular forces available for the day-to-day maintenance  of law and  order would include not only the General Reserve provided in  the  proposals but alsothe  External  Defence Troops which we  propose.  These  forces should be fully adequate to cope with any civil disturbance even, of a major  kind; and theywould, in fact, contain  a considerable margin over the minimum  requirement.The other extreme is the  Internal Security problem in India as it might arise in what may be termed &quot; the worst case &quot; a world war accompanied by hostilitieson  the Frontier and widespread civil unrest.   It is under  conditions such as these that the problem  would assume the  most acute and exacting shape andthe  &quot;worst case &quot;  is accordingly presupposed by the  proposals.     104.  . Before we proceed to deal with the proposed allotment of troops to internal Security,  we should  like to remove a  misapprehension which seems &apos;to exist as regards the effect of modernisation on the power of the troops to preservelaw and order  by  preventing disturbances rather than by quelling them after they have broken out.   An essential  feature of the modernisation of Infantryis the mechanisation of its first-line transport, with the object of greatly increasingthe unit&apos;s mobility. Although at the same time the establishment and equipment of the troops are altered so as  to give a higher ratio of  light machine guns torifles, this modification  does  not seriously detract  from  the  ability to produce an adequate  show of men with rifles,  which  is the  main requirement  in theprevention  of disturbances.     105.  The  allotment of troops  to Internal Security in war as given to thePownall Sub-Committee (Appendix A to their Report) was:           5 Indian Cavalry horsed regiments         26&quot;British Infantry battalions         20 Indian Infantry  battalions in addition to 2 Heavy Batteries  for coast defence with which we deal in  aseparate part of our Report.     The allotment proposed in the  present plan is :           3 Indian Cavalry motor  regiments.         21 British Infantry battalions.         11 Indian Infantry  battalions.     Both allotments include those troops specifically detailed for the defence ofthe  principal  ports.  To both the above totals of regular units must be  added13 Indian  Territorial  Force Infantry  battalions and 2  Indian States  ForcesInfantry battalions which are detailed for Internal Security duties in war.     106.   The justification for  this  reduction in Internal Security troops lies in the fact that the mobility of  the forces now allotted will be greatly increasedby their modernisation.   We have been assured by the Commander-in-Chief thatthe forces  detailed will provide an  adequate  minimum insurance against the worst contingency referred to in para. 103 provided  that, as we feel bound toassume,  we can rely on the continued  loyalty of the Indian Army itself and neednot  contemplate any  widespread  disaffection among  the  police.   No  otherassumption indeed is possible in the circumstances in computing  the strengthof the regular forces as a whole.  At our request the Commander-in-Chief caused the proposals relating to  Internal Security in  the plan to be fully explained to the Provincial Governors; and we learn that they regard the proposals as generally satisfactory.   In certain cases they made suggestions  which the Commander-in- Chief informs us that he has, in the main, been able to meet.   For these reasons
                                                                           1U ,we have found ourselves able to accept the -proposed allotment of troops to internal security.  It will be noted that the percentage reductions on the regular Infantry-battalions  assigned to Internal  Security are  45 per  cent.  Indian and  only19 per cent. British.     107.  Generally, we recommend that the proposals for  the strength anddistribution of the local defence troops shotdcl be accepted.External Defence Troops.     108.  As already explained,  the original  suggestions of  the General Staffmade provision for a reserve available for purposes other than the local defenceof India.   We have adapted  these suggestions  to our conception that the land forces of India should contain troops available for her external defence;  and werecommend  that the suggestio?is, modified as shown below, should be accepted as providing the requisite strength for the External Defence Troops.     109.  The   Pownall  Sub-Committee  contemplated  that  the  &apos;&apos; ImperialReserve Division &quot;  should  be organised as a  division  and  should  consist  of3 British and 7 Indian Infantry battalions with  Cavalry,  Artillery, Engineerand  ancillary units.  We have explained in paragraph 93 the reasons which have led the General Staff  in India to propose to dispense in war with stereotypedhigher formations in the Army as a whole than brigades.  We accept this proposal and  we recommend that it should be applied to the External Defence Troops. Weare satisfied that the latter would be more suitably and  economically organised on the same basis rather than as a stereotyped division.     110.  The General Staff in India first suggested that a separate reserve suchas they then contemplated should include two British Cavalry regiments, and thatthe 10 Infantry battalions should consist of 5  British and  5  Indian battalionsinstead of the 3 and 7 contemplated by the Pownall Sub-Committee.  In the firstplace, the General  Staff were influenced by the  fact that, if only three british infantry battalions were required for this Reserve, two British battalions wouldbecome surplus, and it was not clear what use, if any, could  be made of  them bythe Home authorities.  Other reasons for this change were  that it would makeit easier to provide a  completely British  Infantry brigade if  on any  particularoccasion this were  thought  desirable on account, for instance, of the nature ofthe use to be made of the brigade; and also of the fact that it might prove easier to maintain a  completely British brigade in the theatre of war than a mixedbrigade based on India.     111.  Since then,  however, the War Office have enquired unofficially  whetherthe  authorities in  India would consider  the  surrender  of one British  cavalry regiment and two more British Infantry battalions  in addition to the british units already withdrawn.  This enquiry has been brought to our notice and wehave discussed it with the General Staff in India.  If the War  Office wish to addtwo  more battalions to the Home  establishment  the)^ could be. obtained either  by direct withdrawal  from India,  if so decided, or possibly by  withdrawal fromgarrisons in the Far East, where they might be replaced by Indian battalions.It is not yet certain, of course, whether the War Office will  decide to add these units to the Home establishment, and, if so, which  of the  two alternatives  asregards the Infantry  would be adopted.   So far as the defence authorities  inIndia are concerned, they would be prepared to surrender one British  cavalry regiment and two British Infantry battalions from India and  would  prefer this method to the alternative.   This is clearly a matter in which we can express  no final opinion.  But  we are bound to make some assumption as a working basis forour recommendations even if it can only be contingent.  As a result of consulta-tion between the Commander-in-Chief and ourselves,  the first suggestions of theGeneral Staff have now been modified on the assumption that India will surrender to the  War Office  one  British  Cavalry  regiment and two  British  infantry battalions.   The Cavalry  and Infantry  components  of the External  defence troops will then consist of one British Cavalry Regiment, 3 British and 7 IndianInfantry  battalions.   Thus, as regards  Infantry, there is a reversion to thePownall Sub-Committee^ proposals.
Surplus British units.    112.  If this assignment of units to the External Defence Troops is accepted,the result as regards the withdrawal of surplus British units from the Indianestablishment would be as  follows :  As regards Artillery,  3 British FieldArtillery regiments would, as already shown, be assigned to the External defence troops, leaving a balance of one to be reverted to the Home establishment.  Wewere given to understand in London that no special difficulty need be anticipatedwith regard to this proposal.  It is not proposed to assign any Horse or medium artillery  to this  purpose,  but 3  R.H.A. batteries  and  one British  medium artillery  regiment  would  be withdrawn  from India.   To  these the  sameconsideration would apply.    113.  The table in paragraph 100 to which  we have referred also shows that  British Cavalry regiments and  5 British  Infantry battalions in all wouldbecome surplus to local requirements, excluding the External Defence  Troops.Of these,  1  Cavalry regiment and 3 battalions would on our  scheme be  allotted to those Troops, while the  remaining Cavalry regiment and 2 battalions would,on our assumption, be withdrawn from India.  No further withdrawal of BritishCavalry or Infantry beyond these is involved in our proposals.Disbandment of Indian Units.    114.  Finally, we have to deal with the very serious problems that must arise as a consequence of accepting proposals which would  render  a  large number ofIndian Army  units surplus.  As shown in paragraph 100,  the units  affectedwould be  three Indian Cavalry regiments, 4 companies of Sappers and Miners,and no less than 14 Indian Infantry battalions beside certain  ancillary units.The personnel amounts to about 24,000 combatants besides  1,200 non-combatants.The matter may be  viewed  in three aspects.  There are the political objections which may be anticipated in India  to a considerable reduction in the strength ofthe regular Indian Army.  Just as important are the economic factors, including provision  for the welfare and future employment of the personnel whom it mayno longer be possible to  retain in the Indian Army.  Finally, there  are  the strategic considerations which must arise in connection with a proposal to reduceregular forces in the circumstances of  to-day.    115.  On the political side, the authorities in India have represented to us the need for preparing opinion generally, and, in particular, that  of the local governments, to appreciate the reasons for the reductions that  may have to bemade.  Unless adequate preliminary steps are  taken in this  direction,  there isa  risk of  considerable political outcry which would be exploited by subversiveagitators  as a means of  spreading disaffection in the Army  itself and anti-recruiting propaganda in the recruiting areas.  One argument that can be  usedto counter criticism is that no Army has been or can be immune from reductionsdictated by circumstances at different  times;  and the Indian  Army has been noexception.  For instance,  the combatant strength of the Indian Army stood at154,437 in 1914.  In 1922,  it had come down to 144,617; and at  the present  time it stands  at the still lower figure of 121,155.    116.  There may still be raised the political objection  that,  as a consequenceof  the reductions  contemplated,   57 &apos;&apos; foreign&apos;&apos; battalions   and regiments(40 British and 17 Gurkha) are  to be retained as compared  with 81 Indianbattalions and regiments.   Even if we pass over for the moment the assumptionthat British and Gurkha units should be  bracketed in  this way, it can be shownthat the reductions proposed in the Army as a whole are proportionately higher in the &quot; foreign &quot; than in  the Indian  units, excluding  Gurkhas . In calculatingthis proportion it is reasonable to take as the basis the total establishment as it stood on the 1st July, 1938, and  to regard the  withdrawal of the British units which have since then left India as part of the general reductions that will haveto take place.   It is also reasonable to take account of proposed reductions inestablishments as well as of the withdrawal or reduction of  actual units.  On this basis, the establishment of British troops would be reduced by 25 per cent, (from51,900 to  38,800); that of Gurkha units by 18 per cent, (from 18,700 to  15,400);that of the two together would be reduced by  23 per  cent.   The establishmentof Indian troops proper would be reduced by 19 per cent,  (from 125,800 to 102,000).If, on the other hand,  Gurkha and Indian troops  are bracketed together,  thepercentage reduction remains approximately 19 per cent.
    117.  Further  points  to  be stressed, particularly  for the reassurance of provincial Governments,. are that the reductions are proposed to be effected on.a proportionate scale, not  only  as between British, Gurkha and Indian troops,but also with regard to Provincial  recruitment;  and  further with regard toclasses and communities.   It is  intended that they shall be spread over at least4 years.   Certain Provinces will benefit by the release of  lands now utilised bythe Army; and  the benefits may by mutual co-operation be employed to mitigate the effects of the reductions. Finally, we are assured that the Central Governmentwill do their utmost  to assist in obtaining fresh employment overseas for  menrendered surplus in India.    118.  The fact remains that a large number of men  will have to revert to civil life.  Owing to the serious  disadvantages  inherent in  stopping an even flow of recruitment, it will unfortunately not be possible to absorb any large number in the remaining units; nor is there any scope for absorption in the Army Reserve,since this itself will have  to be  reduced owing  to the reduction of units, and itis already complete to the new establishment  that will be required.  The  mendischarged will, of course, receive the usual  mustering-out  concessions in theform of accelerated pensions  or of  gratuities.  Beyond that, there  seems  littlescope  for  direct assistance on the part of the  Central Government.  vocational training will no doubt be  made available as far as practicable, but we under -stand that its usefulness in India is strictly limited, since, owing to considera-tions of caste  and calling most  Indian soldiers are averse from learning specialtrades.  It becomes all the more incumbent, therefore, on the Provincial authoritiesto assist wherever it may be possible by land settlement schemes or other measureswhich  might help to alleviate the hardships of  premature discharge.    119.  The strategic objections to any considerable reduction of the regulararmed forces at the present time need hardly be stressed.  Nevertheless, we havesatisfied ourselves after anxious consideration that the plan that we propose will afford  India an  adequate minimum insurance for her local  defence together witha reasonable measure of provision for the joint responsibility for external defence.We do not think it would be justifiable to plan on any wider  basis in presentcircumstances.   The defence authorities in India consider that though a certainamount of discontent will  be unavoidable and  political capital will undoubtedly be made over  the proposals, neither  of these factors is likely to be  of sufficientmagnitude to affect to any serious extent the military situation in India.  after full consideration of  all  the circumstances we are of the  opinion that  these objections are not  an insuperable obstacle to  carrying out  the proposals.  Atthe same  time, we recognise, and we are well aware that the  defence authoritiesin  India  recognise, the great rsponsibility that is involved  in such a decision.They  are anxious that nothing  should be left undone to explore the possibilityof retaining some at least of the surplus units, even though it may be a  small proportion, as combatant units  within the Imperial forces;  as, for  instance, byemploying them at Imperial stations overseas where proposals  for replacing orstrengthening the forces may be in contemplation.  We strongly commend thissuggestion for  consideration  by the  Home authorities, and we  hope that allpossible means of giving it effect will be investigated.    120.   We feel, however, that the necessity for reduction must be faced and accepted, and we have no option but to recommend accordingly.      Section 4. Comments on the Organisation and Equipment Proposals.    121.  We set out in Appendix IV details of the proposed organisation andequipment of  the different types of  modernised units.   Except in the case of  afew specialised  administrative  units, it is proposed that  the basic organisationand equipment  of  each  type  of unit should be uniform  throughout the Armyirrespective of the category in which the unit may be serving at a particular time.Such  local modifications as have been  proposed in the interests of economy and efficiency  affect  the nature of the transport provided for  the  carriage of armsand equipment  only, and  are necessitated by the peculiar conditions of terrainon the Western  Frontier of India.    122.  We have examined the details  given in the Appendix and comparedthem with the establishments and scales of equipment of similar units at Home.
&quot;We found no marked differences in the Indian establishments as compared withthose at Home, except where, as in the case of a Cavalry Light Tank regiment,the function and role of the unit in India is not the same as that of the Homeunit.   This differentiation of r61e is responsible for certain differences in, forinstance, the scale of transport provided, and we  are  satisfied that in the fewinstances  which  came  to our  notice  where additional  equipment has beensuggested in the case of.the unit in India, it is justified  by the  fact  that thelatter has to operate under different conditions of  service  and in  quite  differentterrain from the comparable British unit. But in nearly all cases which were examined the  scale of equipment of units in India, both  as regards armament,reserves  and  mechanical  transport, was  lower  than  that provided  for the relevant British unit.    123.  As  a result of our examination, we consider that the. proposals aregenerally suitable and should be accepted, subject to the comments below.Cavalry Organisation.    124.   In  the  first  place, we considered whether  it  would  be  feasible to substitute an Indian Cavalry Motor regiment for one of the three Cavalry LightTank regiments in a Cavalry brigade in the General Reserve.  It was suggested to us that  such a change would be  justified  on  its merits,  and might effect an appreciable economy.  We have heard  further evidence on the subject and theGeneral Staff  have given us reasons for adhering to the original proposal.  Wedo not feel that we are in a position  to  make a final  recommendation on thismatter, but we are of opinion that it is a suitahle subject for further consideration.Medium Artillery.    125.   We  also  considered  whether it was necessary  to retain  medium artillery in the Frontier Defence troops, and whether its role could not adequatelybe performed  by 25-p.ounder  guns.    On  this matter, too, we  heard  further evidence;  and here also the General Staff preferred to adhere to the original proposal.   They represented  that in Frontier operations Medium Artillery shellfire,  both  in its material and its moral effects, produces results which cannotadequately be  achieved either by Field Artillery or by Bomber aircraft.   Further,they pointed out that the Afghan Army already  possesses Medium as well asField Artillery, and  they  attached  great importance  to being able to countersuch Artillery effectively.   We consider that the balance of argument is in favourof the General Staff view,  and recommend that their proposals for the provisionof Medium Artillery should be accepted.Comments  on  other measures.    126.  We also took note of  certain points of detail included in Appendix V,regarding  which it appeared to us  that room for economy or  for improvementmight be found after further consideration by the defence authorities in India inthe course  of the exhaustive review which they will undertake while putting thescheme as  a whole into effect.  We similarly examined a schedule* of detailedmeasures which will be necessary to give effect to the modernisation plan.  on some items questions of .policy  arose with which we deal  below.   Other itemswe noted for  further consideration as  in the previous  case.  For convenience ofreference we have brought together  in  Appendix V all the  items thus noted forfurther consideration, together  with our comments on them.  We have  added tothis Appendix certain further suggestions which were made to us in evidence.Repair organisation.                                        .  .    . 127.   The first question of policy arises on the proposals for a comprehensiveorganisation  for  mechanical  repairs,  at an  estimated  capital  cost of  overRs. 2  crores.   First-line repairs will be  effected by mechanics attached to eachunit, and by 50 Light Aid Detachments.   For second-line repairs stationary andmobile workshop companies will be  provided.  As regards third-line repairs, itwas at one time hoped that trade resources might be utilised to some extent in lieu of  military workshops, but this unfortunately has  proved  impracticable atpresent.   Proposals are also made for three Heavy Repair shops  at  Chaklala,Quetta and Deolali, to deal with the reconditioning of  all vehicles at the end of                          * Reproduced in Appendix VI.
their assumed life.  Vehicles which have reached that stage may in many cases be serviceable if reconditioned,  since under  Indian conditions they  are not soheavily worked while in service as at Home; but it may be difficult to obtain thenecessary components if the type has  by then gone  out of production.  Thealternative is to scrap  and replace the  vehicles as soon  as they  have completed their assumed life, in which       third-line repair organisation of the scopeproposed would not be required.  Before steps are  taken to  complete the third-line repair&apos;  organisation, we recommend  that the whole  problem  should  bere considered and the  fullest enquiry  made into  the  relative  advantages  ofreconditioning and replacement, in order that the most economical solution may befound and put into effect.Anti-gas equipment.     128.   The next point relates to the provision of anti-gas equipment, which is mainly designed to provide respirators  of the modern  service type and personalequipment for all Army personnel in India.  On the principles that we have adopted concerning the troops in India,. we  regard  it  as axiomatic  that  theyshould be trained in, and provided with, personal anti-gas equipment in the samemeasure as the Regular troops  elsewhere; and we.  do not,  therefore,  questionthis item.     129.  We note in this connection that the civil authorities in India have not so far taken action to provide corresponding measures for the protection of thecivil population in vulnerable centres, either  against gas  attack from the air or indeed against air attack generally. While recognising that this matter does not strictly come within our purview, we think it right to call attention to it because in certain cases the complete absence of protection for the civil population in areasclosely adjacent  to important military  centres might  produce a state  of panicwhich would seriously interfere with the ability of troops in such centres to carryout their duties.  We understand that the Government of India have the matter under consideration.Ammunition depots.     130.  We next draw attention to the items relating to  the  construction ofammunition  depots.  The principle of this proposal is that  ammunition shouldbe stored in separate depots designed for the purpose instead of in dangerousproximity to other stores as  at present.  We  do not question that it is  desirableto arrange for the separate storage of ammunition, but  we observe that it has notyet been found possible  to give it full effect at Home,  where the dangers of air attack are, of course, much greater.  While accepting this proposal in principle;we are of  opinion that, in  view of the present low risk of  air  attack and theexpense involved, the ewtent to which it should be given effect should be considered from the standpoint of priority.Reserves of war material.     131.  Finally, we deal with the question of reserves of  war material.  Weset out below the principles on which these have been calculated.   In the case ofboth weapons and ammunition we have compared the percentage reserves proposedby the General Staff for field units in  India with those put forward by  the WarOffice last summer for the Imperial Reserve Division, as it was then called, whichwere understood to be less than the rates assumed by the War Office for a field force operating in an Eastern theatre.   The comparison shows that in nearly allcases the percentages proposed for field  units in India are lower, and in severalinstances appreciably lower.   One obvious reason is that the operations in whichfield units in India may be engaged are likely to be less intense.  In the case ofammunition, an emergency reserve of three months&apos; supply  has been added tocover  the  risk  of  such contingencies as  strike  action or interruption  of communications.   Having regard to conditions in  India,  we  consider  thisjustifiable,    132.  The general basis  on which reserves of weapons have been calculatedtakes into account the following factors  :     (a) Percentage total loss through enemy action.    (&amp;) Percentage total loss through wear and non-repair.
 :    (c) Time necessary for factory production (&quot;production lag &quot;).     (d) Percentage repair margin, i.e., the number of weapons held to cover those           under repair at any time.     (e) The estimated time of repair of weapons.     133.   These factors vary according to the weapon concerned and (in certain cases)  the role of the unit.   To take an example :  in the case of light (Bren)machine guns,  the loss through enemy action  is put at 12 per cent.&apos; a year for field  units, but nil for  Internal  Security units;  the  loss through  wear  and non-repair is assessed at 10 per cent, for field units and 5 per cent, for internal security units;  the time of production is twelve months;  while the repair marginand the time of repair are 20 per cent, and six months  respectively and  are thesame for both  Field  and Internal Security units.   The  resultant percentagereserves proposed  are  32 per  cent, for Field units and 15 per  cent, for internal security units.     134.   In the  case of ammunition reserves, the basis taken for calculatingpercentages has been the estimated expenditure of each type per month multipliedby the &quot; production lag &quot;  in months;  to this total has been added in each case anemergency  reserve of  three  months&apos; supply,  intended to cover  the  risk ofbreakdown in supply owing to strike action, interruption of communications andother contingencies.     135.  As regards the rate of expenditure of ammunition, the &apos;&apos; productionlag &apos;&apos; assumed  in  calculating the percentage  reserves has varied according towhether  the ammunition  in question is  intended to be  produced in the IndianOrdnance Factories or by  overseas supply; in the latter case a uniform &apos;&quot;&apos; voyagelag &quot; of two months has been allowed for.     136.   Generally, we find that the proposed scales of reserves are suitable andwe  recommend  their acceptance.External Defence  Troops.     137.  As shown in Part  II of Appendix IV, the proposed equipment of the external Defence  Troops.will be on a somewhat higher scale.  For instance, theField Artillery regiments will have 24 guns each as compared with  16; while the infantry battalions will have more light machine-guns and anti-tank rifles and ahigher scale of mortars, and the  carrier platoon of the headquarters company willhave armoured  tracked carriers  instead of wheeled  trucks.  The total number of motor vehicles in these battalions will be 65 as compared with 48.  We recommendthat the scale of equipment proposed  for  the External Defence Troops should be approved.                Section 5.  The Time-Table of Modernisation.     138.   The  process of  modernising the Army in India on the extensive scalecontemplated in our proposals  will necessarily  cover a period of some years,however  intensively the problem is tackled.   Independently of considerations offinance, which are dealt with elsewhere in our Report, there are several factors which limit the rate at which the modernising programme can be carried through.The proposals assume -that, having regard to the international situation in  generaland its possible repercussions in India in particular, modernisation of  India&apos;forces should be completed at the earliest possible date.     139.   In the first place, it is necessary so to arrange the process  of modernisa-tion that the number of units  thereby rendered temporarily unfit for active service is not  so high as to prevent  active operations being undertaken at short notice.This limiting factor affects different arms in different degrees :  all Infantry unitscould,  from a  purely operational  standpoint,  be modernised simultaneouslywithout loss of effective strength, while Cavalry modernisation would have to beso planned in successive stages as to leave sufficient units at any time fully capableof active operations.  Again,  so far as the various  components of the forces areconcerned, Internal  Security  troops and the General Reserve would as far aspossible be modernised first,  in  view of the relatively higher degree of mobilityrequired for these units.
    140.  Another -important factor limiting the speed of modernisation is therate of production and delivery of the new equipments, vehicles and stores.  Thegreat bulk of the armament required for the initial issues will be obtained fromthe United Kingdom, which is already taxed in its manufacturing resources tomeet  the requirements of rearmament at Home.  While the latter need has  are recognised priority over Indian requirements, we assume that Indian needs willbe  given  a sufficiently  high priority,  among other  demands,  to enable  there-equipment of the forces in India to be completed, so far  as the supply ofMaterial is concerned,  within the  five-year period covered by the modernisationproposals.   We understand that if orders can be placed before the end of thepresent financial year, the supply authorities at the War Office are prepared toensure production of the equipment required for the units of the External defence troops by the  end of the financial year 1940-41.  In general, the provision of vehicles is likely to present less difficulties than that of armament.    141.  The training of personnel in the tactical and technical use of the newvehicles and weapons is also a factor entering  into the modernisation time-table.Here, again, the training of the Infantry presents a smaller problem than that ofthe Cavalry.    142.  With the large-scale expansion of motor transport under the modernisa-tion proposals, the provision of garage accommodation and an efficient repairorganisation are requirements of  the first importance.  In  the former case thetime-table is conditioned by the rate at which the necessary building programmecan be completed.   In the latter case it  is in  effect governed by the time essentialto training the necessary number  of artificers,-  for instance, it is not consideredthat a mechanical  repair organisation such as is required could be provided withits quota of fully trained artificers under a period of  four and a half years.  Infact,  it may be said that the supply of trained artificers is the determining factor in  the whole  problem.     143.  Taking  all these limiting factors  into consideration,  the  proposalscontain a detailed time-table for the modernisation of the Army in India, whichis reproduced as Appendix VII to this Report.  We recommend its adoption, andwe call particular  attention to the  need for placing early orders for the equipment of the units of the External Defence Troops in  India, ivhose needs would be given priority.     144.  It should be borne in mind that the programme of the disbandment ofIndian Army units and of the withdrawal from India of British units surplus to indian requirements under  the proposals has been carefully  co-ordinated  withthat  of the modernisation of the remainder,  in view of the operational  and other requirements dealt with  above.       Section 6. Major savings  effected by the modernisation proposals.     145.  The major savings anticipated as the result of the reorganisation and modernisation proposals are as follows :       (i)  Reduction in the number of units and of the establishments of the units           to be retained.      (ii)  The abolition of the Grass Farms section of the Farms Department and           large reductions in Remount and Veterinary services.     (iii)  The abolition of the Equitation School.      (iv)  The amalgamation of the existing three Indian horsed Cavalry Training-           regiments into one central mechanised Cavalry Training Depot.      (v)  The amalgamation of the two Artillery Training Centres now existing           into a single Training Centre, for all the Artillery.      (vi)  The amalgamation of the present three separate Corps of Sappers and           Miners into two Corps.     (vii)  A reduction in the number of Infantry Training battalions.    (viii)  The abolition of a number of small cantonments and detachment stations.      (ix)  The sale of land and buildings.      (x)  A  reduction in the number  of permanent headquarters and staffs           required for the command and administration of the Army in peace.      (xi)  A large reduction in the number of units and establishments to be raised           on mobilisation for which stores  and equipment have at present to be           kept in peace.
 Section 7. Indian States Forces.  The &quot; Indianising &quot; units of the Indian Army.     146.   Although  the  Indian States  generally are guaranteed protection by the British Government against attack, many of them maintain  forces of  their own,  of widely differing  degrees of efficiency.   Some are mainly  for ceremonial purposes;  others are useful for Internal  Security  purposes within the States; while others attain the level of second or even first-line troops.  Some  of the latter,. which were then known as the Imperial Service Troops, served with  credit in the Great War.  In 1921 the  Government of India introduced a scheme  under which the more  efficient  forces  of  the participating States  were divided  into two categories  : Class A troops, which could by agreement with the Ruler be used for general service on mobilisation :  and Class B troops,  which are  restricted to Internal Security duties.   A number of regular officers of the Indian Army are detailed to assist the States,  but their functions are purely  advisory  and they have  no executive authority.  The units are officered almost entirely by States subjects.    147.   It was a part  of the scheme of 1921 that the Government of India should continue as previously to supply a free initial  issue of arms and equipment. In 1931, however, owing to financial stringency, the Government of  India found it necessary to suspend the free issue of arms  and to inform  the  States that as a temporary measure they must purchase the arms  themselves.  We refer again to this matter  later.  Different  kinds of  arms are  issued to the  various States Forces according to their  category.  The  Class  A units  are assigned for service with the regular forces on mobilisation, and the Rulers have undertaken to make them  available.  They comprise  4 Cavalry  units, 2 Mountain batteries,  1 Sapper and Miner unit, 5 complete Infantry battalions and 3 half-battalions, a Camel Corps, and 2  transport companies.   In war  all the  units  utilised would  be supplied by the Government of  India with arms and ammunition,  mobilisation equipment, transport, rations, &amp;c,  but the States  would  continue to bear all ordinary peace-time charges.    148.  The roles  for which  the  Indian States  Forces units are at present earmarked in war do  not require that they should be equipped on the same  scale as the modernised regular forces.  The proposals provide for the employment of the following States Forces units in war :      In the General Reserve:        4  horsed Cavalry regiments,        1  Camel  Cavalry regiment,        2  Mountain  Artillery batteries,        1  Engineer field  company. The inclusion of these  units  is suggested, not because a definite  task in warcan be foreseen for them, but because they happen to be available.  There is little doubt, however,  that in  certain circumstances they  might form  a  valuableaddition to the General  Reserve, which has no horsed Cavalry or MountainArtillery.    In &quot; immediate reinforcements &quot; for the Frontier Defence Troops:        3  Infantry battalions,  to protect the lines of  communication between             Sibi  and Quetta, and  of Quetta  itself, in the event of war  with            Afghanistan.    In the Northern Command Reserve:        2  Infantry battalions.    For the protection of  strategic raihuays:        2  Infantry battalions.    149.  We have referred in paragraph 18 to the evidence we heard from threeprominent  Rulers.  They laid stress on three points which we have  reserved forcomment in this part of our Report:      (a) They claimed that, if any further financial assistance were given by His       .   Majesty&apos;s  Government, a share should be allotted to the  Rulers  who           maintain States Forces, in recognition of the fact that  the Princes           alone among all the diverse elements in India can be implicitly relied
           on  to support  the  British connection, and that it would be in the           common interest to give them practical  encouragement, by assisting           them, for instance, to  organise and modernise  their forces  on the           pattern to be adopted for the regular Army.  We recognise, however,           and gathered that they were ready to admit, that in  this matter the           needs of the regular Army must have priority.     (b) They urged that the undertaking of  1921 should  be observed, and that           the free issue of arms  which has  been suspended since 1931 should           be resumed.  We are informed that the Government of India now           intend to issue free of cost such arms as are  surplus and available           to those units of the States Forces which are entitled to them under           the 1921 scheme, and to inform the States accordingly.  They will at           the same time assure the States that they realise the value of their           co-operation in defence matters; and that there is no intention of           withdrawing from  them any arms  or equipment  which  they  have           provided at their  own  expense, even though  these may be  classed           technically as &quot; Government equipment.&quot;  The Government of India           are also preparing a revised scheme which is to  be considered in           connection with the introduction of Federation.     (c) They mentioned that they had great difficulty in obtaining efficient rifles           from the Government of India, even on purchase, for their armed           police, which needed modern weapons to  cope with bandits and deal           with disturbances;  and  they suggested that this indicated  a want of           trust on the part of the Government which they felt to be unjust. This           is not a  matter that strictly comes within our province, but  we under-           stand that in practice the Rulers have no difficulty in purchasing arms           suitable for police use. &quot; Indianising &quot; units of the Indian Army.     150.   The equivalent  of  one  complete division and  one  Cavalry brigade within  the Indian  Army,  including 4 Cavalry regiments, 1 Field  Artillery regiment, and 12 Infantry battalions, besides Mountain Artillery, Engineer and Signals units,  is now in process  of being Indianised; that is  to say, all  the vacancies in  the lower officer ranks  are filled as they  occur by Indian officers who have been trained at the Indian Military Academy.  The process is admittedly an experiment, the results of which cannot be tested until the Indian officers become due to fill positions of command.  At present the commanding and senior  officers are British.  We are advised that for reasons of policy it is considered impracticable- cable to include any of the &quot; Indianising &quot; units among those to be selected for reduction.  The Indian Army,  therefore, if the total number of units is reduced as  we  think  inevitable,  will in future contain a  higher  proportion  of &apos;&apos; Indianising &apos;&apos; units than at  present.  So long, however, as the senior officers are British, the defence authorities  see no reason for  regarding these units as less efficient than the remainder of the Indian Army, and they have made no dis- crimination on that account in drawing up their plan.  The crucial stage will not be reached until 1945, when the British officers will  begin to disappear entirely. When that stage is reached, the whole experiment may have  to be reviewed, and it would be unwise to forecast the  result.                      Section  8. Office Establishments.     151.  We  offer here  some remarks on the  staffs  of  Office  establishments connected with Defence which can conveniently be included in this Chapter, since the major part of the staff in question is concerned with the Army.     152.  In considering the  possibilities of economies in  the  administrative work of the Defence Department, we have made some review of the administrative and clerical staffs to the extent that  was possible in the brief time at our disposal. In the years  immediately following the Great  War it was considered that therewas considerable scope for retrenchment and reform in this direction.  Successive Committees of Enquiry, from  the  Inchcape Committee of 1922  to the IndianRetrenchment Committee of 1931, conducted detailed  reviews of the military and civil staffs of the Defence Department, both at Headquarters and in the variousCommands; and, as  a result, considerable reductions were made.
     153.   We have made ourselves acquainted with the broad lines of the enquiry-conducted by the last-named Committee whose review of staffs in India was of avery detailed  description and led to appreciable economies.  We have obtainedreturns of the numbers of staffs employed under the various departments of ArmyHeadquarters, and while there have been certain increases in the course of the last six years, we understand that additional work has been thrown on the departments in these years. In this connection we must have regard to the probability that if our proposals for modernising  the  foi-ces in India are implemented, the work involved will call for the provision of some additional staff, both military and civil.     154.   We have formed the impression from what we have heard in evidence as well as from other less official sources that the detailed day-to-day administra-tion of the defence forces may be unduly complicated by excessive  &quot; paper-work,&quot;and more particularly that the process of audit is  carried to  unnecessary refine-ment.   We consulted the Financial Adviser, Military Finance,  in considerable detail on the latter point: while agreeing that in some respects this criticism wasnot unfounded, he pointed out  that  Indian conditions necessitated a relativelyrigid system of audit and  that  any marked relaxation of the code of rules  and regulations which governed defence expenditure was  likely  to  be attended byappreciable risk of financial laxity.  With this appreciation of the matter we arein general agreement.     155.   At  the same time we are glad to learn that proposals are now beingmade for the reduction of the percentage of audit throughout the  defence services in India and,  as in the United Kingdom, for the placing of a  greater reliance onthe Commanding Officer&apos;s certificate that expenditure has been properly incurredwhile emphasising his own responsibility in the matter.     156.   We were also informed that it is the  intention to replace a number of relatively highly-paid clerks employed on mainly routine work by men at lower rates of pay.     157.   It was suggested to us in evidence that in certain grades the  clerksemployed under the Defence Department were paid  on a higher scale than thenature of their duties justified, and we note in this connection that new and lower rates of pay  have recently been  introduced for new entrants  to the MilitaryAccounts  Department.  We recommend that a comprehensive review of clericalrates of pay in the Defence Department might  profitably be  undertaken  with aview  to ascertaining whether further economies could not be effected in  thisdirection.     158.   We note the extent to  which mechanised  accounting  has been  intro-duced  in the Military Finance Department, and we were informed that a saving of more than  Rs. 4 lakhs a year  had already been effected in this way, with a prospect of additional economies when mechanisation has been extended to furtherclasses of accounts and certain Army establishments outside Headquarters.        Section 9. Conditions of Service of the British Troops in India.     159.   In the  brief time at our disposal we have been unable to enquire in any great detail into the general conditions in which the British soldiers in India are serving.   We  have,  however, heard  evidence from the Adjutant General  and representative Commanding Officers of British units in India on this subject, moreparticularly with the object of  informing ourselves of the extent to which the amenities and improved conditions  of service  recently introduced  in India, inconsultation  with the  authorities  at Home,  have  removed  any  substantialgrievances, and also of ascertaining whether a  feeling of dissatisfaction withservice in India persists on the part of the British soldier.     160.   The result of our enquiries has  been on the whole reassuring.  TheGovernment of India have, with few exceptions, adopted similar measures to thoseintroduced in the past two years at Home in  order to improve  conditions ofservice.  In one or two instances, conditions in India render it undesirable orunnecessary, for reasons of health or climate, to adopt parallel improvements tothose introduced  for the British soldier at Home;  in some other cases it  is theview of the authorities  in India that their regulations already  provide more generous treatment than Army regulation at Home.   Certain other concessions,
such as higher fuel scales and furniture for married soldiers&apos; quarters, are still under  consideration by Army. Headquarters.  But with these few exceptions wewere informed that the measures taken at Home to improve conditions of  service had been adopted, mutatis mutandis, in India for the British soldier.  We were unable to ascertain, in evidence,  that any very substantial grievances  remain,with the exception of one major question to which we refer in the next paragraph.In  many cases, the  improvements recently adopted carry out recommendations made in the course of a detailed  survey of the conditions of service of british soldiers in India conducted during 1935 by the Adjutant General&apos;s department at Army Headquarters, the implementation of which had been postponed at thetime mainly on financial grounds.  We may mention in this connection that thecost to Indian funds of these  concessions recently introduced is estimated by theMilitary Finance Department  at about Bs. 1 -4 crores ( 1.050,000).    161.  We heard evidence, including that of certain Commanding Officers ofBritish Troops, on one important point, namely,  whether the present  tour  ofservice in India (from  5-5^ years on  the average) was regarded as too  long  bythe British soldier and operated  as a deterrent to recruiting for  the RegularArmy at Home.  We were informed that the question of  shortening the presentforeign service tour had  been under  consideration by the military authorities at Home, and we invited  the views of the Commander-in-Chief upon it.  his general conclusion was that a reduction of the present tour to  one of not lessthan 4 years  would not adversely affect the efficiency of units in India  as  awhole :  the financial effect on Indian funds would,  however,  be considerable.From the evidence we heard,  we gathered that  the impression prevails that thelength of time which the  British soldier spends in India is the most unpopularfeature of his service  in  this country, and that  a  shortening  of the  tour  toone of 4 years, if practicable on financial and military grounds, would be generally welcomed.   In view, however,  of the heavy  annual cost which, this measure would impose on  Indian revenues it  is impossible for  us to make any recommendation on  the  subject in existing financial  circumstances.    162.  Two further matters may be mentioned on which representations  weremade to us.  In the first  place  there appears  to  be a  need for improvements in certain respects in barrack  accommodation for British units in India, notablyas regards the provision of adequate  dining-halls, cook-houses and bath-houses.We were informed  that  improvements in  this direction  are being effected  as opportunity offers  and money becomes available, but we understand that forthe most part British barracks in India fall definitely short of modern require-ments  in the  respects mentioned.   It  would be desirable, if possible,  that  some provision should be made each year for this purpose.    163.  In  the second  place, the Army  authorities in India, while grateful for the recent grant of  2,500 made  by the War  Office  from non-public funds to help in the  provision of amenities for British soldiers in India, urged strongly that this grant should be increased;  they  represented that the total funds  attheir disposal  from  sources in India  for such purposes are very restricted andhave for some years been expended  to a disproportionate extent on the Britishsoldier in contrast to the Indian soldier, and that there are no sources in india from which funds might accrue such as exist in Command tattoos and displaysat Home.   We are  not sufficiently  informed on  this question,  however, to  do more than  invite the attention of the War Office to the views of the competentofficers at Army Headquarters as  stated above.           CHAPTER 7. THE  RE-ORGANISATION OF  THE AIR  FORCES.                 Section 1. The Strength of the Air Forces    164.  The question of the  strength and composition of the air forces requiredfor the local  defence of India has  proved one of considerable  difficulty.  Wehave heard much  evidence on this  subject and have  given  it  very  carefulconsideration.    165.  When the Pownall Sub-Committee considered the question the situation was that the defence authorities had stated that a force of 2 Bomber squadrons,3 Army Co-operation squadrons and 1 Bomber Transport squadron equipped with
aircraft  of  adequate performance  would be a sufficient  air component in theforces required to deal with tribal unrest on any scale within India&apos;s own borders.The defence authorities in India had also stated that in  the event of war withAfghanistan 4 Bomber squadrons of the highest performance would be requiredin addition, to undertake a vigorous and sustained air offensive from the outset of the war.  The purpose of this  air offensive was to destroy  the air resourcesof the Afghan Government,  to hinder the mobilisation of  Afghan regular forces and to deter the Afghan Government  from pursuing hostilities further.   TheSub-Committee endorsed  these proposals, subject  to  certain observations  as  tothe manner  of employment of the squadrons in war, and on the understandingthat if foreign intervention  assumed serious proportions the proposed  air forces could not be expected to deal with the situation unassisted.     166.  The Sub-Committee  also recommended that,  although  two  of the bomber squadrons should continue to be trained and equipped for  the purposeof coast defence, no regular  air forces should be maintained specifically for thatpurpose.   They suggested that auxiliary air force units  should be  raised fromthe local flying clubs at the main defended ports for spotting and reconnaissanceduties.     167.  Since the Sub-Committee reported the  defence authorities in india have reconsidered the plan for the conduct of a war with Afghanistan  and donot now regard as essential the proposal  for a vigorous and sustained  air offensive against that country from the outset of the  war.  In view of  this change ofthe plan for the conduct of war, the Commander-in-Chief has reconsidered his proposals for  the strength of the  air  forces  and he now  states his  minimum requirements for India&apos;s local defence at 4 Bomber squadrons, 3 Army  Co-opera-tion squadrons, 1 Bomber Transport squadron.   He explains  that two of the bomber squadrons would be required to deal with  tribal unrest and the defenceof the North-West Frontier  against Afghanistan;  two Bomber  squadrons wouldhave a primary role of coast defence but would be available  to reinforce the squad-rons on the Frontier if not needed or when no longer needed for coast defence. TheCommander-in-Chief also contemplates that, if it were essential to undertake air operations against Afghanistan while two Bomber squadrons were still requiredfor coast defence duties, the two remaining Bomber squadrons would be released from their duties on the  Frontier  in connection with the control of the tribesand would be used for the offensive operations.     168.  This change in the Commander-in-Chiefs proposals has put the Com-mittee in a somewhat difficult position.  We recognise that the  general strategicconception underlying the proposals is that of the  Commander-in-Chief himself,who is responsible under the  Government of India  for  the defence of India;and he has  assured us that  although both land and air forces  are  on a  strictlyminimum basis, he  is satisfied that, taken together,  they are  sufficient  for thelocal  defence of India  and to carry out the strategic policy  which he has  inmind.  Nevertheless,  the  Committee have been unable to  reach agreement onthe Commander-in-Chiefs proposals in regard to  air forces, and their different views are set out below.     169.  Some members of the Committee either  accept the Commander-in-Chiefs proposals or  feel that it  is impossible for them to recommend majoralterations in  them without at the same time taking upon themselves responsi-bility for examining and criticising his  strategic plan in detail.  They point out,moreover, that under arrangements suggested elsewhere  in  this  Report, allstrategic plans affecting India would be the subject of early consultation betweenthe  Commander-in-Chief and  the  Committee of  Imperial Defence,  and  thatin so far as amendments to these  plans were proposed after  consultation and approved by the two Governments, some  reconsideration of  the strength and composition of the land and air  forces might be required.     170.  Other members of the  Committee, however, hold the view that theproportion of  air forces allotted for India&apos;s defence is definitely too small.  Theyfully agree  with the  recommendation as regards  the consideration  of strategicplans by the Committee of  Imperial Defence, but they are concerned that theproposal for a vigorous and sustained air offensive against Afghanistan shouldhave been abandoned, and they also fear that the dual role allotted  to two of
the Bomber squadrons must lead to a dangerous weakness in the worst case.They emphasise the fact that air forces closely approaching the total now recom-mended by the Commander-in-Chief were required in Waziristan recently todeal with  a localised tribal  outbreak, whereas the situation  which must becontemplated under  the proposals is an Afghan war coupled  with widespreaddisturbances  among  our  Frontier  tribesmen  at  a time  when the  Empire is at war with a first-class Power.   Because of this,  and bearing in mind the manyvulnerable  points in the North of India, and the gradual development of theAfghan Air Force,  they regard the scale of air forces proposed by the  Com-mander-in-Chief  as  an under-insurance,  and they  consider that  two  bomber squadrons should be  added, making a total of six Bomber squadrons, three army co-operation squadrons and one Bomber Transport squadron.     171.  The  Indian Air  Force.- -It is expected that the Indian Air Forcesquadron at present being formed will be fully  completed  by  the  end of 1940.When  this stage is  reached it will  be possible  for the Commander-in-Chief todecide whether its general  efficiency  is such as  to justify its inclusion as a squadron in the order of battle.  If a favourable decision is given the squadronwill then form one of the approved total of squadrons to be maintained in India,and will release a British squadron.  We might perhaps add in this connectionthat we have heard encouraging reports of the capabilities of the Indian Air force personnel and we accordingly  see every reason to hope that the Indian squadronwill in due course take its place among India&apos;s  first-line squadrons.     172.   Volunteer Flights for Coast Defence. In addition to the regular airforces  required for  the local  defence of  India, it is proposed that five  flightsshould be raised on a volunteer basis for certain  duties  in connection with coast defence which  are described in Chapter 9 of our Report.   It is  intended thatthe five flights should be raised  at Bombay,  Karachi, Calcutta and Madras,respectively, where they will be developed out of the existing civil flying clubs,A second flight will be raised at Bombay for duty at Cochin.  The establish -ment of these flights would ultimately be wholly volunteer, but to begin with a proportion of regular personnel would be essential.                Section 2. Details of the Air Force proposals.Strength of squadrons.&quot;  .  173.  It is  proposed that there should be 12 initial equipment aircraft ineach Bomber and Army Co-operation  squadron and 10 in the Bomber Transportsquadron.  It is also proposed that each  of the volunteer flights referred to inparagraph 172 should have  a strength of  4 initial equipment aircraft.Types of aircraft.     174.  It is  proposed that all Bomber squadrons should be equipped withBlenheim aircraft, the  Army Co-operation squadrons  with Lysander aircraft,and the Bomber Transport  squadron  at the outset with Valentias, which would subsequently be  replaced by Bombays. The volunteer flights are to be equippedinitially with Audax or Wapiti  aircraft.Cycles of Re-equipment.     175.  Provision is  made in  the estimates of the cost of maintenance for a fund for replacements  and renewals, on the assumption that there will be a5-year cycle of replacement of Bomber aircraft and an 8-year cycle of replacementin respect of Army Co-operation  and Bomber Transport aircraft.  The proposals in regard to the last-named types are based on the retention of aircraft of anolder design and for a longer period than  would be justified for Bomber aircraft. While we do not dissent from  this  policy,  we understand that there may be difficulties in regard to its  practical  application.  Under the time table set outin  paragraph  180,  the re-equipment of Army Co-operation squadrons withLysander aircraft would be completed in 1941, and this type  would remain in service in India until 1949.  While  we  agree that Lysanders are suitable forIndia at  present, we are informed that  there is doubt whether this type will
 continue in production after the end of 1940.  If this doubt is justified it would appear that a bulk order for all future requirements of aircraft and spare parts of this type should be placed this year, otherwise it would be necessary to depend for some years on the  availability of stocks at the disposal of the Air Ministry; and we understand that no assurance has been given in this matter.  We suggest that  this question of  supply  requires  an early investigation  by the  defence authorities  in.India in consultation with the Air Ministry. Scales of Reserves of aircraft and engines.     176.  The plan assumes that the scales of reserves hitherto adopted in India will be continued.  These are, for airframes 100 per  cent, and for engines 150 per cent, of the  initial equipment of Bomber and Army  Co-operation squadrons; and for airframes 30 per cent, and for engines 50 per cent, of the initial equipment of the  Bomber Transport  squadrons.  We have discussed  with  the   defence authorities  the question of the adequacy of these scales of reserves.  The scales we have cited are lower than those applied to other Royal Air Force squadronsoverseas, where we understand the scales of reserves go up to as much as 200 per cent, for airframes and 225 per cent, for engines.  The question of reserves  was referred to in the financial  appreciation attached to the Pownall Sub-Committee&apos;sReport, which gave an indication of the probable cost of increasing the scale of aircraft and engine reserves  in India to the higher  level.  No proposal  to adopt this higher  scale seems, however, to have been raised in subsequent discussion.     177.  We have been informed  that the proposal to  adhere to the  existing scales of reserves is founded on the assumption that on this basis the reserves would last for approximately 6 months after the outbreak of war, and that freshsupplies of aircraft and engines could then be  expected to  arrive from the UnitedKingdom.   We  accept  this assumption  on  the  understanding  that  India&apos;srelatively small war requirements would be met out of the Air Ministry&apos;s reserveseven in the worst case.  This is a matter which requires definite confirmation.Reserves of  Bombs and Petrol.    178.  The following provision is proposed in the plan in respect of reserves of bombs and petrol:       (i) Reserves of Bombs.         We refer later in  our Report to a proposal to manufacture certain types    of bombs and bomb components in India.  If this proposal is approved it    is the intention to limit  the  reserve of these types  to a 3 months&apos; supply,  a    proposal which we regard as satisfactory.     (ii) Petrol Reserves.         It  is proposed to hold seven weeks&apos; stock of aviation  spirit  in India    based on the war consumption of the new types of aircraft proposed. Petrol    for the  air forces  in India is obtained from Burma, and in view of the low    scale of attack to  be anticipated on sea communications between India  and    Rangoon we regard this scale as satisfactory.  In  addition, a 6  months&apos;    reserve  of tetra-ethyl-lead is to be held.Other features of the plan.     179.  We mention here certain other important  features  of  the  plan inrespect of the air forces.     (a) Mobility of Squadrons.         Provision is made for  the essential equipment and personnel to form     a pool of mechanical transport sufficient for the movement of two squadrons     at a time.     (b) Deficiencies of Stores.         The present stock of Air Force stores, which is in theory equivalent to     three mqnths&apos;  war  requirements, is heavily depleted.   An item  has been     included in the estimates for the replenishing of stocks and for raising the     authorised basis to that of  6 months&apos; war requirements.
    (c)  Modernisation of ground equipment.        A necessary corollary of the decision to equip  the air forces in India    with modern types of aircraft is that ground equipment should be similarly    modernised.  This necessitates the provision of a large variety of new items,    including modern wireless apparatus,  night  flying equipment,  re-fuelling    and re-arming gear  and the modernisation of depot machinery.    (d)  A erodrome improvements.        The new type of Bomber aircraft to be supplied to India will necessitate    the improvement of  existing aerodromes and landing grounds.    (e)  Equipment for Reserve Aircraft.        It is proposed to purchase 100 per cent, of the  standard equipment for    reserve  aircraft instead of 60 per cent, as has hitherto been the practice.Time Table  of Modernisation.    180.  Subject to the supply of aircraft being available, it is proposed thatthe main reorganisation  of the  air forces suggested for local defence should bespread over  five years as follows :     1st year.        (1)  Formation of the Bomber  Transport squadron.        (2)  Re-equipment of  four  existing Bomber squadrons  with Blenheim               aircraft.        (3)  Partial re-equipment of the first Army Co-operation squadron with               Lysander aircraft.                 (Provision of 12 initial equipment plus 2 spare aircraft.)        (4) Re-equipment of the  Indian Air  Force  squadron  with Audax               aircraft.    2nd year.        (1)  Completion  of re-equipment of the first Army Co-operation squadron.        (2)  Re-equipment of  the  second  Army  Co-operation  squadron with               Lysander aircraft.    3rd year.        Re-equipment of the third Army Co-operation squadron with Lysander    aircraft.    4tth year.        Nil.    5th year.        Re-equipment of the  Bomber Transport squadron with Bombay aircraft.    181.  We  recommend that the proposals detailed in this section should beaccepted, subject to further examination of the points raised in  paragraphs 175and 177.                 Section 3. Air Forces for External Defence.    182.  There  is now left for determination what reserve of air forces forthe external defence of India is required to be added to the air strength for local defence.  The principle which we have proposed  as regards the joint responsi-bility for external defence  applies  equally to the air forces  as  to the Army.We have had, however, to have regard to the annual contribution of  2,000,000promised by His Majesty&apos;s Government as from the 1st April, 1939, towardsthe total defence expenditure of India.  Unless  this contribution is increased,we are  of opinion  that no  more than 2 Bomber  squadrons  should  be providedfor this purpose in addition  to the forces required for local defence, and we should regard this  addition as India&apos;s  maximum  share, at the present time, of the airforces to be stationed in India for the purposes covered by the joint responsibility.
r* C.I.D. Paper No. 198 D.    183.  It appears from the Report of the Pownall Sub-Committee that theChiefs of the Staffs had envisaged that as many as eight Bomber squadrons mightbe required to be  available in India for air reinforcements in the Middle and far East.  &quot;We understand that there has recently been some reconsideration ofthis number  and we make no  recommendation as regards the total  air forces which  should be held in India.  We have therefore limited our recommendation to the  provision of two Bomber squadrons in addition to the local defence airforces.  When agreement  has been reached as regards the total further numberof squadrons to be held in  India for the present, it would, if our recommendations are accepted, be necessary to reconsider  the amount of the annual contribution and add to it in  agreement between the two Governments  such  round sum as would  reasonably represent  His- Majesty&apos;s  Governments  share  of the  totalexpenditure on the basis which we have explained.   &apos; 184.  The estimates of the cost of the air forces assume that the two bomber squadrons  for external defence would  be provided in the  second year of thefive years over which reorganisation will be spread.       CHAPTER  8. THE REORGANISATION OF  THE ROYAL INDIAN  NAVY.    185.  The  Chiefs  of  Staff in paragraphs 2 and  3 of their Report* of the2nd July,  1938, noted that  the documents  referred to them  for  considerationcontained only a passing reference to measures affecting the Royal Indian Navy;and recommended that the question of naval defence should be taken into account in any comprehensive  arrangement which might  be  reached  in the  matter ofdefence expenditure between  His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governmentof India.    188.  The proposals placed before us by the Commander-in-Chief in  Indiaincluded a  scheme for the  reorganisation of lndia&apos;s naval forces.  It is based onthe agreement, to which the Chiefs of Staff refer, between His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  and  the Government of  India which was announced  in  January, 1938.Under that agreement His Majesty&apos;s Government consented  to forgo the formerannual subvention of  100,000  and miscellaneous annual charges  valued at 15,000- 20,000 on  condition that the Government of India maintained a sea-going  squadron  of not less than six  modern escort vessels, which would be free to co-operate with the Royal Navy for the defence of India, and, in addition, thatthey would fulfil  India&apos;s responsibility  for the local naval defence  of Indianports.  The contributions accordingly ceased as from the 1st April, 1938.    187.  We  have discussed  with the Commander-in-Chief  in  India,  theCommander-in-Chief, East Indies Station,  and the Flag Officer  Commanding,Royal  Indian Navy, the reorganisation of India&apos;s naval forces in accordance withthe agreement.   We were informed that, in order to make good India&apos;s under-taking, the Flag Officer Commanding had prepared in May 1938 a comprehensive scheme which provided, over  a nine-year period, for the completion of the localnaval  defences, the establishment of  training Depots, the replacement of the oldsloops Cornwallis, Lawrence and Clive, the rearmament with H.A./L.A. guns ofthe two escort vessels  Hindustan and Indus,  the construction of a sixth  escort vessel  and  six minesweeping  vessels, and the  provision of eight Motor  torpedo boats  to provide an offensive measure of local defence.  The estimated capital cost of  these  proposals  was  Rs.  733-3  lakhs  and recurring  annual  costRs. 64 1 lakhs.    188.   This scheme had been re-examined by the defence authorities in indian order that it might be brought into  line with the conception governing thecorresponding schemes for the Army and the Air Forces; namely, that of theminimum insurance which it was essential to provide.  Their conclusions were asfollows :        (i) First in priority was  placed  the provision of adequate local  naval           defence.   At the same time it was thought most undesirable that the           Royal  Indian Navy should lapse into a purely harbour defence force           and that accordingly some type of sea-going vessels must be provided.           The price of the&quot;&quot; Black Swan &quot;  Class of escort vessel, which had now
           risen to Rs. 55 lakhs, was regarded as prohibitive.   The alternatives           were &quot; Bitterns &quot; (Rs. 47 lakhs) or &quot; Fleetwoods &quot; (Rs. 35 lakhs); but           the latter&apos;s speed of only 15 knots was held a serious objection.  A           matter for consideration was whether the armament of six 4-inch guns           could be reduced to four guns,  but as the saving would be very small           the reduction was deprecated.     (ii) The rearmament of  Indus and Hindustan seemed most desirable  but           could, it was thought, be postponed if necessary.     (iii) It appeared that the six minesweepers would cost Rs. 12 lakhs each.  As           regards the possibility of obtaining a cheaper  type, the  Flag Officer           Commanding had stated that the &quot; Mastiff &quot; type trawler, a possible           alternative, was too small to accommodate the  numbers of reservists           to be trained in addition to the  established complement.     (iv) While the Flag Officers alignments for the provision of Motor Torpedo           Boats were carefully considered, it was doubtful whether these vessels           were essential; and, in any case,  it was felt that they should have  a           low position in the  priority list.     (v) As  regards local defence, it  was considered that provision  should be           made for &apos;               (a) Auxiliary   minesweepers  for training  and the  necessary                     equipment for all auxiliary vessels.               (b) Training of reservists to man auxiliary vessels, together with                     the  provision  of training  establishments,  instructional                     equipment, &amp;c.     189.  Before  leaving London  we  received  the demi-official  views  of  theAdmiralty Naval Staff on the proposals referred  to in paragraph 187.   In IndiaOffice telegram No. 1975 dated the 16th November, we were informed that the com-ments sent to us could be regarded as the  official views of  the Naval Staff.  Wedo not feel it necessary to state these in our Report as they are substantially thesame as those put  forward in evidence  to us  in India and summarised inparagraph 188.   They were, however, very helpful in enabling us to form an appreciation of the issues involved before we discussed them with the authoritiesin India.Class of Escort Vessel.     190.  The Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, explained to us that until Reserve Fleet  cruisers arrived on his  Station, he would  have to rely onStation resources alone.  Vessels of the &quot; Fleetwood &quot; class were not suitable onaccount of their low speed of 15 knots.  The first duty of  the escort vessels wasthat of close escort of troopships conveying reinforcements East or West; and thesecond that of assisting in the protection  of the  trade routes.   For the formerduties a 19-knot ship was required; and in support of that argument, we were informed that the new British India Company ships, which would be taken up inwar, possessed a speed of 161- knots.  Both Admirals were in favour of 19-knotships.     191.  Some discussion took place whether the term &quot; not less than six modernescort vessels &apos;&apos; in the agreement implied the provision of six new ships or of four.On examining this point we were satisfied that the original understanding hadbeen that India should only pay for six &quot; Indus &quot; class,  and that,  as regardsnumbers, four new ships plus Indus and Hindustan re-armed would form a satis-factory modern squadron.  We  therefore recommend that four new escort vesselsbe provided,  the Cornwallis, Lawrence and Clive being scrapped.*  As regardsthe type, we  agree with the view that  the  cost of the Black Swan is prohibitiveand we accordingly recommend  that the new ships shoidd be &quot; Bittern &quot; type.Minesweepers.     192.  Both the  Commander-in-Chief, East  Indies  Station, and the flag officer Commanding, Royal Indian Navy,  pointed out that the  &quot;Mastiff&quot; typetrawler, which the Admiralty Naval Staff had suggested would be suitable as wellas considerably cheaper than the small minesweepers included in the  Flag Officer     * No allowance has been made for the scrap value of these ships in the estimates.
Commanding&apos;s nine years&apos; plan, would provide insufficient accommodation for thereservists to be trained. The trawlers could  accommodate only 6 reservists each,while the number to be trained at sea amounted to 1,330 annually, plus a small number of  gunnery ratings for  manning a  certain number of armed merchant cruisers and defensively armed merchant ships.  The Commander-in-Chief, east indies Station, informed us, however, that  he had proposed to the Admiralty,and the Admiralty had accepted in principle,  that four &apos;&apos; Halcyon &apos;&apos; class mine-sweepers, which the Admiralty intended to  maintain in reserve on the Station,should be loaned to the Royal Indian Navy for training reserves.  If these vessels were loaned as proposed, the Flag Officer Commanding would for the present be relieved of the necessity of providing new minesweepers for training.  There is,however, a dual requirement in  respect of minesweepers, viz., training in peace and local defence in war, and we were informed that, on the outbreak of war, the&apos;&apos; Halcyon  &apos;&apos; class vessels would be immediately required elsewhere and would notbe available for the local naval defence of the major ports of India.  Further, theFlag Officer Commanding informed us that 48  auxiliary vessels were required forwar. of which 40 were so  far earmarked and the remaining 8 did not exist in indian waters.    193.  Clearly therefore a certain number of minesweeping vessels must beprovided for the Royal Indian Navy.    We do not consider, however, that theexpensive  type previously  contemplated  need  be  provided.  On the assumptionthat the Admiralty  are prepared to loan four &quot;Halcyon  &quot;  class in peace, the&quot; Mastiff &quot; type trawler should meet the requirement.   The Flag Officer Com-manding stated that  the  four  &quot;Halcyon&apos;&quot;  class  plus two &quot; Mastiff&quot;. classtrawlers would be sufficient for  peace training requirements but,  as the formervessels would be removed on the outbreak of war, it was suggested to us that fourtrawlers should be provided as the minimum  to carry on with, and that the secondpair of vessels should be maintained in reserve.  We endorse this view and our recommendation is  therefore  that four  &quot;Mastiff &quot; type trawlers be  provided,assuming the loan of four  &quot; Halcyon &quot;  class minesweepers.    194.  In  connection with the loan of the four  &quot; Halcyon &quot;  class vessels itwas represented to us that it would be unfair that India should bear the whole cost  of their  maintenance.  We  feel  there is justification  for  this view  and recommend for consideration  that India should, be relieved of the maintenance expenditure which the Admiralty would have borne had India, not  taken over  thevessels.Re-arming of Indus and Hindustan.    195.   We recommend  that the re-arming of these ships with H.A jL.A. gunsshould be effected.Motor Torpedo Boats.    196.   We are in  agreement with the view  that, although Motor torpedo boats  would  furnish  an  additional insurance,  their provision should not beembarked  on at present.   The  efficient maintenance  of  these craft  presentsdifficulties, and the initial and recurring costs appear  beyond India&apos;s  presentcapability to meet.Training Depots and Equipment and Local Naval Defence Ecpiipment.     197.   We recommend that  the  requirements  under this heading  shotdd beprovided on the scale proposed.Summary.     198.   Our recommendations are :       (a). The  construction of  four &apos;&apos; Bittern &apos;&apos; class escort vessels in replacement           of Cornwallis, Laivrence and Clive, which will  be scrapped; the first           pair to be ordered in 1939-40 and completed in 1941-42; the second           pair to be ordered in  1942-43 and completed in 1944-45.     (6) The  construction  of  four &apos;&apos; Mastiff &apos;&apos; class trawlers, to  be  ordered in           1945-46 and completed in 1946-47.     (c)&apos;The  loan of  four  &quot;Halcyon&quot; class,  the  first pair in 1939-40 and  the           second pair in 1941-42. Consideration should be given to India being           relieved of a portion  of the maintenance cost.
     (d) The re-arming with H.A./L.A. guns of Indus  and Hindustan.     (e) The provision of Motor Torpedo Boats to be postponed.     (/) The provision of  depots and instructional equipment and of local naval           defence equipment as in paragraph 188 (v).                        CHAPTER 9. COAST DEFENCE.     199.   We have referred in paragraph 29 to the risks of attack upon india from seawards and to the  &apos;&apos; scales of attack &apos;&apos; which  have been drawn up bythe  Committee of Imperial  Defence in relation to the principal Indian ports.In consultation with the Commander-in-Chief and his technical advisers we havemade a careful examination  of the coast defence problem, and we describe belowthe measures which we recommend should be adopted.     200.   It will be recalled that in respect of the air forces two of the bomber squadrons to be provided are to be specially trained and  equipped to undertake a  dual role of duties on the Frontier and for coast defence.  It is also proposedthat five  flights of  aircraft should be raised on  a volunteer basis to assist inthe  defence of the  ports.  The  employment  of aircraft for the coast  defencerole affords a measure of insurance not only against direct bombardment of the ports by ships, but also against attack on the ports by seaborne aircraft, a dangernot  guarded against by the installation of counter-bombardment artillery sincethe  attack would be launched from outside the range of coast defence guns.     201.   The danger to the ports will in all probability disappear when  once the  commerce raiders  have been rounded up  in  the first few months of the  war.Consequently the initial  cost of a full-scale of coast  defence  counter-bombard-ment artillery and  of  anti-aircraft guns would be more, in our opinion,  thanIndia need necessarily incur at  the present time.     202.   It  is considered  that  the provision of 6-inch  coast defence guns onmodern mountings at certain  of  the defended ports  would offer  a substantial measure of additional protection  at a reasonable cost;  and  that, given thesedefences, so long  as the scale  of attack is no higher than that  of a cruiser orarmed merchant  vessel, necessarily  operating some thousands of miles from itsbase, bombardment  of the ports would be unlikely.     203.   The proposals  are as follows :  Bombay.     The existing defences at  Bombay consist of two obsolete 7-5-inch gunstogether with five 6-inch 15D  guns  and  four H.C.D.  lights.   The Committeeof Imperial Defence recommended in 1929 that the two 7-5-inch guns should bereplaced by two 9-2-inch guns.  It is  now proposed that two of the 6-inch15Q  guns should  be  replaced by  two 6-inch  450 guns  and that  the fire controland range-finding equipment of the 7-5-inch  guns should be  modernised.  Wehave carefully considered this  matter with reference to the recommendation ofthe  C.I.D.,  and we have concurred in these proposals as  a reasonable substitute for  the 9-2-inch  guns, in view of  the very heavy cost  of these guns,  the  small scale of  attack to be anticipated,  and the provision of  the two coast  defenceBomber squadrons.Calcutta.     204.  There  are no coast defences at present at Calcutta.  The Committeeof Imperial Defence recommended in 1929 the installation  of two 6-inch 15D gunsand  two H.C.D. lights. It is proposed that the two 6-inch 15Q guns which willbe released  from  Bombay should be transferred to Calcutta; and pending theirtransfer it is hoped to install two 4-7-inch guns to be obtained from Hong Kong.The  two H.CD. lights will also be installed.Karachi.     205.  The Committee of Imperial Defence recommended  the  provision oftwo  6-inch (45D) guns and two  H.C.D. lights.   The installation of these  guns isin progress  and will be completed during 1939.
Cochin.              -  &quot;  --. ,   206.  Whereas in 1929 the Committee of Imperial Defence made no recom-mendation in respect of this port,  it now ranks fourth in the order of priority for the armament of ports.   No- defences exist at present,  and it is proposedthat ultimately two 6-inch (45Q) guns and three H.C.D. lights should be installed.Until the 6-inch guns can be obtained from the United Kingdom; it is proposedto install two 60-pdr. guns from stocks already available in India.Madras. -    207.  The Committee of Imperial Defence recommended in 1929 the installa-tion of four 6-inch 45Q guns.  In July 1938, however, they stated that this provi-sion might  be an over-insurance.  It is proposed to provide two 6-inch  (450)guns when obtainable, and meanwhile to install  two 60-pdr. guns out of existingstocks.  It is also proposed to install three H.C.D. lights.Vizagapatam.    208.  The Committee of Imperial Defence  have stated that ultimately two6-inch (45D) guns and four H.C.D.  lights may be required at this port, but thatfor the present no provision need be  made in peace beyond preparing the necessaryplans.  The proposals include no provision for guns at this port.                      Anti-aircraft defence of the ports.    209.  It is proposed that the provision of anti-aircraft artillery at the ports should be as follows : -         Karachi   ...    ...     ...    ...    ...      4 3-inch guns         Bombay    ...    ...     ...    ...    ...      8      do.         Calcutta   ...    ...     ...    ...    ...      6       do..        Cochin    ...    ...     ...    ...    ...      4      do.with a reserve of six guns.  Tour guns are also provided for Madras, but difficultymay be found in siting them.  If so, consideration would be given to the alterna-tive of providing 2-pounder equipments as a defence against low-flying aircraft.No provision is thought necessary for Vizagapatam.    210.  Of the total of 32 guns proposed,  8 will be available in India as soonas the existing mobile anti-aircraft battery  is re-equipped with 3-7-inch guns.In recommending these proposals we assume that steps will be taken to ensure theprovision of the small number of guns required by India from the supplies whichare now being made available from various sources in the United Kingdom.    211.  The estimated cost of these proposals (excluding the cost  of the airforces referred to in paragraph 200) which is included  in the Army sub-head ofthe financial statement at Appendix IX  is Bs. 91 lakhs capital and Rs. 12 lakhsannual maintenance.Summary of proposals in regard to Coast Defence and Anti-Aircraft  Artillery.    212.  The recommendations  we have made  above in regard to  coast defence and anti-aircraft artillery  would  ultimately result in the  following  scale of equipment at the various ports :     Bombay-         2 7-5-inch  guns  (with  modernised  fire  control  and  range-finding                 equipment).         2 6-inch (450) guns.         3 6-inch (150) guns.         4  H.D.C. lights.         8 3-inch A.A. guns.     Calcutta          2-6-inch (15G) guns.         2  H.D.C. lights.         6 3-inch A.A. guns.

As with the defence services generally, the insurance provided by theseproposals is, on account of financial considerations, necessarily on a minimumbasis; but we are satisfied, that in all the circumstances the proposals are adequate and we recommend that they should be accepted.                     CHAPTER  10. ORDNANCE FACTORIES.     214.  One  of the most important aspects of  the proposals for the modernisa-tion of the  forces concerned the expansion of the existing  Ordnance Factories,with a view to  making India as far as possible self-sufficient in  the supply ofmunitions in war.  The financial effect of the proposals is considerable, amountingto Rs. 368 lakhs of capital expenditure and appreciable additional recurrent cost.We have taken evidence on the subject and have carefully considered the questionsof policy underlying the proposals.     215.  Consideration was given at the Imperial Conference of 1937  to thedanger of the interruption of sea communications between the United Kingdomand India in the event of war, having regard to  the changes in the international situation in the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East; and the conclusion was drawn that  India should be made as self-supporting as  possible in the supply of essential munitions of  war.     216.  The authorities at Home concerned with the supply of warlike materialhave welcomed this policy, not  only for the reason given above but also for thefurther reason that the development of munitions factories in India  would provide an additional source of supply East of Suez which  would be most valuable for production purposes from the general Imperial standpoint.     217.  The  Government of India recognise the importance of  the subject inparagraph 10 of their letter of the 9th February,  1938.  It was one  of the matterstaken into account  by  Major-General PownalFs Sub-Committee in the summer of 1938,  and their recommendation that &quot; the requisite reserves and  sources ofsupply of warlike material should be built up in  India, and that India should beplaced as early  as possible  on a self-sufficient basis so far  as may prove to be practicable &quot; (paragraph 44 of their Report) was endorsed by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee in their Report of the 2nd  July, 1938 (paragraphs 31, 32).     218.  India already possesses six munition factories, some of them originallyestablished by the East India Company; they are an integral part of the defence organisation and are administered by the Master-General of the Ordnance. the factories are:           The Metal  and Steel Factory, Ishapore: which  makes steel for  guns,     rifles, shells, small arms ammunition,  fuzes,  &amp;c.         The Gun and  Shell Factory, Cossipore: which  produces guns  up to     60-pdr;  and howitzers up to 6-inch, and their components.         The Rifle Factory, Ishapore : which makes rifles, components and sword     bayonets, and light machine guns.
         The Ammunition Factory, Kirkee : which makes small arms ammunition     and fills shells, fuzes, &amp;c.         The Gun  Carriage Factory, Jubbulpore : which manufactures  artillery     carriages and  vehicles, general service wagons,  &amp;c.         The Cordite Factory, Aruvankadu:  which produces  cordite and in     addition activated charcoal for respirators.     There  are  also  factories for the  manufacture  of harness and  saddlery (Cawnpore) and clothing (Shahjahanpur).     These factories supply a considerable portion of the peace-time requirements in warlike stores.     219.   We visited the three first-named factories  during our visit to Calcutta, We were thus able  to acquaint ourselves at first-hand with their scope, organisa- tion and manufacturing processes.  So far  as we were able to judge, the factories are  competently and economically  administered,  though some of the  equipment is in need of replacement.  We understand that so far as comparison is  possible, the cost of the articles produced compares favourably with that of similar articles obtained by outside purchase.  The existing factories are so organised as  to allow for some degree of expansion in war, and we  were informed that with certain exceptions they  could maintain and repair in war all the present equipments of the Army in India that they are capable of producing initially.     220.   The proposals  we are making for the modernisation of the Army in India will, however, introduce new weapons and increased scales of  equipment, and the proposals for the reorganisation and expansion of the Ordnance Factories aim at making India  as far as possible self-sufficient in  the more essential munitions both  in peace and in war apart from initial  equipments required by the modernisation plan.     221.  Before setting out these proposals, however, we think it right to refer to the other possible methods of dealing with the problem, namely, the enlistment of private enterprise, and the accumulation of reserve  stocks.  As regards the former, there is  to-day an almost complete  absence of any armament industry in India, and, indeed, of a potential field for creating one.   With the  possible exception of Tata&apos;s steel works,  there is no firm engaged in industry in India whose works might be adapted to  the purpose of munitions manufacture on alarge scale.  Moreover, even in the case of this firm, extensive as are its activities in the steel industry, we are informed that there is  little chance of satisfactory arrangements being made with them  for  the  installation of special plant  for meeting possible military requirements in war.  Their contribution to the  require-ments will be limited to the sale of such steel as is suitable for use in the factories. While certain classes of ordnance stores could be obtained from outside industry in India in war, this would not be the case with munitions in the narrower sense of the term.  Again, there is no motor manufacture in India to-day,  and  allmotor vehicles have to be imported from abroad or  at least  assembled in India from imported components.  Nor does an  aircraft industry  exist in  India.     222.  We have, nevertheless, heard evidence that it might be possible to interest Indian  metallurgical firms in setting  aside some plant, however  smallin particular cases, for war-time use in the manufacture of munitions,  and wesuggest that this might be explored by the Government  of India.  At the same time we recognise that even if such arrangements could be made they would onlycover a small part  of the field, and that in any  case they  could not solve  theimmediate problem of securing vital  munitions  supplies  in the critical  years ahead.  We record  the  opinion of  a high  authority on  Indian industry, stated to us in evidence, that with perhaps one partial exception none of the OrdnanceFactories  enumerated above in the expansion programme could be  dispensed with by drawing on the resources of outside  industry in the country.  We have considered the possibility  of adopting in India the plan  now being implementedat Home, of erecting, imprivate establishments at the cost of the State, subsidiary works and plant to be built, maintained and (in war) operated by the militaryauthorities; but  we are satisfied that such  a scheme  is impracticable in existing conditions  of Indian industry,  and would  probably prove, in  any case, anuneconomical proposition.
     223.   Both we ourselves and the defence authorities in India fully recognise the inherent difficulties of any plan for the supply of war requirements in India.Under the factory expansion proposals, the peace requirements of  the  variousmunitions will be comparatively, small: under peace conditions equipments havea long life and rates of ammunition expenditure and the yearly turnover of stocks are low.   The capacity for expansion in war must entail the maintenance of anuneconomical  level of general overhead charges in peace time;  and  this shouldbe regarded as  part of the  insurance  premium against war  risks.   A  further difficulty  in the factory proposals concerns the  supply of raw materials  for thefactory.   While India or neighbouring  countries cansupply the bulk of the basemetal ores required  for munitions production, the metals themselves,  as requiredfor manufacturing processes, are  practically all imported.  Considerable stocksof these raw  materials  would consequently have to be held in peace to guard against the holding  up of war production.     224.   The alternative course to production in India is to rely on obtainingher munitions in war from outside the country, apart from the limited quantitiescapable of being produced by her  Ordnance Factories on their present basis and through  their existing capacity for war expansion.   This course  involves the laying up of considerable stocks of warlike stores, and these reserves must allow for various factors;  such as the varying production lag of particular  stores afterwar production commences; the voyage period,  which in the case of  stores from home might amount to as much as two months if the Cape route had to be used;and the added risk of interruption of India&apos;s sea communications due to enemy action.     225.   Further, the policy of accumulating large reserves of stores, though itoffers certain advantages, has some marked drawbacks.  Apart from  the cost of storage, depreciation of stocks represents an  appreciable element of  cost wherethe annual turnover  is necessarily small for most classes of stores.  The principaldrawback lies, however, in the inherent inelasticity of a policy of stock-holdingas compared with the maintenance of a reserve  of productive capacity : changesin type may well render obsolete large quantities of accumulated stocks.     226.   Weighing the respective  advantages and  drawbacks  of  the  courses open to India, we come to the conclusion that the  policy suggested to us by the responsible defence authorities in India is strategically the  sound one to adopt;namely, to expand India&apos;s existing Ordnance Factories to make her in all majorrespects self-sufficient in munitions  in time of war.  This self-sufficiency cannotbe complete, and it is not proposed to provide for the manufacture of those types of warlike stores  of which India is a  small user,  or where the article is of socomplicated a character as to make the installation of the necessary plant disproportionately-disproportionately uneconomical.  Further,  it  should  prove possible to  meet  thediminished needs  of harness and saddlery in a  mechanised army by  drawing onoutside industry,  and we consider that similar possibilities with regard to thesupply of clothing should be fully explored.     227.   It is proposed, as an essential element of war expansion plans, to trainthe necessary number of skilled  men  who would be  required  in war.   little difficulty is anticipated in obtaining the unskilled labour or in giving it the brieftraining necessary for the routine processes of work on which it would be engaged.In so far as it  may prove possible to interest outside industry  in India in theproduction of munitions on the lines suggested earlier (paragraph  222) either before or after the outbreak of war, this reservoir of skilled personnel to be  trained in the Ordnance Factories will provide a nucleus of skilled men for instructionalpurposes.  The  Indian Ordnance Factories are,  and are intended to remain, free from any  control by the Provincial authorities.   This point  may  be of some importance in political conditions as they may develop in the next few years.     228.   It should, we feel, prove possible to  spread the  uneconomic overheadelement of the proposed factory system by obtaining a greater measure of  outsideorders for war material, not only  from Empire  and other Governments, but also from other buyers  such as the Indian Stores Department.  It has been pointed out to us in evidence that there are  certain  difficulties which limit the extent towhich the latter can place contracts with the Ordnance Factories; but we considerthat the whole question should be  further explored.
&apos;  &apos;  229.  We now give below in broad  outline the proposed scheme for  there organisation  and  expansion of the  Indian  Ordnance  Factories, with  theestimated costs :   &apos;                          -         The Metal and Steel Factory:  to be reorganised and expanded to manu-    facture heavy bombs and forge light bombs (Rs. 80 lakhs).         The Gun and Shell Factory: to be converted to manufacture new types    of equipments and ammunition, and expanded to machine light bombs and    manufacture pistols and certain bomb components (Rs. 73 lakhs).         The Rifle Factory: to be expanded and re-equipped to make Bren    instead of Vickers-Berthier light machine guns (Rs. 73 lakhs).         The Ammunition Factory:  to be expanded (Rs. 10 lakhs).         The Gun  Carriage Factory: to.be converted to manufacture new types    of gun carriage and to make light machine gun mountings (Rs. 6 lakhs).         The Cordite Factory:  to be expanded (Rs. 24 lakhs).         The Filling Factory:  to be expanded (Rs. 32 lakhs).         The T.N.T. Factory: a new factory to be built at Kirkee (Rs. 70 lakhs).  -    230.  Except in the case of the T.N.T. factory which would be entirely new,these proposals represent the expansion or  adaptation of existing establishments.It was represented that India could not count on being able to obtain an adequate supply of high explosive from Home sources, apart from the difficulties  of  itstransport in war conditions, and that the establishment in India of a factory forthe production of  trinitrotoluene and  amatol was very  necessary.   We under-stand that the Government of  India have enquired whether Imperial chemical industries would be willing to undertake  the manufacture of these products inIndia, but that the firm have rejected the suggestion.    231.  The estimates of capital expenditure involved  at the several factoriesenumerated above have been the subject of careful review by the Master-Generalof the Ordnance; but they remain necessarily very conjectural at the present stage of evolution of the detailed plans, and they have not been finally examined by theMilitary Finance Department.  The requirements of all the forces, including the external  Defence Forces, have been taken into  account  in the estimates.  the factories would serve not only the Army, but also the Air Forces and the RoyalIndian Navy.  No attempt has been made  to apportion the capital and overheadcosts between the services.   The estimated cost has been included in the  Armysubhead of the financial statement reproduced in Appendix IX.    232.  In Appendix VIII we give a table of the main items  of  equipment required under the modernisation proposals, indicating  the extent to which itis proposed to obtain the initial supply and subsequent maintenance requirements from Home, and from the Indian Ordnance Factories, respectively.    233.  It will be seen that the field to  be covered  by the reorganised and expanded factories is selective, and is based, with a few exceptions, on makingIndia  self-sufficient  in  all the types of armaments  and ammunition  of  whichconsiderable quantities are required after the initial supply  has been obtained.Other  considerations apart, it would  clearly be impracticable to obtain theseinitial requirements from the  Indian  factories without prolonging the periodof modernisation to an extent which would defeat the main object in view in.theproposals.    234.  W.e recommend that the Ordnance Factory reorganisation proposalsenumerated above should be adopted. As the question is one of much wider thanpurely Indian significance, we also recommend that consideration should be givento the  co-oi&apos;dination of  these  proposals with  any  similar plans that are contem-plated in other parts of the Empire.                        .  CHAPTER 11. FINANCE.    235.  When ,the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s  proposals for the reorganisation and modernisation of the land, air and naval forces required for the local defenceof India  were submitted to  us,  they  were  accompanied by  detailed estimates of the capita! cost of  the proposals and of  the future maintenance  charges ofthe reorganised forces.  These estimates were subsequently revised to give effect
to the alterations of the original proposals made during the course of our enquiry by the Commander-in-Chief and to which we refer in our Report.  We were alsofurnished at our request with further&apos; estimates of the capital and maintenancecosts of the External Defence Forces referred to in Chapter 5.   We have brought the revised and the further estimates together in one table shown in Appendix IX.    236.  In the figures showing the estimated  net capital cost, no  deductionhas been made for the contribution provisionally offered by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  towards the cost of modernisation.  They assume, however,  that  a contri-bution  of  200,000  which  India  expected to &apos; receive  from  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the financial year 1938-39 towards the cost of mechanisation ofBritish Cavalry in India now in progress  would be paid.  If this payment  iswithheld the estimated capital cost of modernisation would be increased by this sum... The figures include the cost of making good existing deficiencies,  and they take account of  the capital savings  which would be secured under the proposals.    237.  The estimates of recurring maintenance costs are built up  by takingthe present cost of  maintaining the existing  defence  forces in India, addingthereto the additional cost resulting from modernisation of the proposed reducedforces and deducting (a) the  saving due to modernisation and (6) the presentcost of the surplus units.  The present expenditure includes the cost of  the recentimprovements in the pay and conditions of service of British soldiers as  giveneffect to in India, estimated by the Defence Department at about Rs. 1 - 4 crores( 1,050,000).  It also includes Rs.  75 lakhs ( 562,500) for  the  reconstruction of Quetta cantonment.  An annual  charge of the same sum for this work  is contemplated up to  the  year  1945-^6 inclusive.   Credit has  been taken in theestimates for the proposed annual contribution from His Majesty&apos;s government from  the 1st April, 1939, of Rs. 2-67 crores ( 2,000,000).  .-, 238.  We  should also mention that  both  the capital   and  maintenanceestimates include  the customs duties - payable on  imported articles subject  to duty, amounting to  about Rs. 31^ lakhs on capital items and on increase  ofRs. 18^ lakhs a year on  maintenance  items mainly on  imported petrol.  Asregards the latter a sum equivalent to the  customs receipts of the current year has been  included in the  Budget  provision.  Allowance to cover both sets  of items will no doubt be made out of the additional revenue which will be received,either by continuing the present practice or by deducting  the amounts from thecustoms receipts and showing a corresponding reduction in defence costs.    239.  The estimates generally were prepared by the Defence department in some haste,  but  were, we  understand,  considered in great detail and withcare on the most reliable material  available.  There is, necessarily, considerable uncertainty as regards a very large number of  the detailed estimates and the assumptions underlying them; and many of them from their nature contain  a sub-stantial element of conjecture and  speculation.  Time had not permitted of anycritical examination of the estimates as a whole by the Military Finance Branch.This  was proceeding during our stay in India and has not yet been completed.We have  been unable to make any  close examination of the estimates, but from such information as we have obtained we have no  reason to doubt that they areas reliable as they could be made in the short time available.    240.  On the basis of the estimates  prepared  as we have explained,  thenet total capital cost would be as follows : Croresof rupees.Million S.Army ...Air ForcesNavy ...36-26 6-21 2-6227-20 4-66 1-96Total45 0933-82On the assumption referred to in our Report as to (i) the length of time whichwould be required to complete the work of equipping the forces, and (ii)  the spread of the expenditure over this period, due regard being had to the co-relation
of the several operations involved, it is estimated that the net capital cost wouldbe incurred year by year as set out below :                                               Crores                                            of rupees.

The annual recurring cost of maintaining the forces during  the fiveyears in which modernisation is  being carried out is estimated as follows  :                         Army.      Air.     Navy.     Total.                           (Figures in crores  of  rupees.)                        40-91      2-25     0-83      43-991st year    ...     -                 7o     0.83      44-992nd year    ...     -    f 4b      d                  45.333rd year    ......    40 b4      a o*4th year    ...     ... -   40-68      3 90     0         45-625th yearTotal   ............     ...     225-42These figures give an  average estimated annual cost for the first five years ofRs. 45-08 crores ( 33-81 millions).  After the fifth year when the reorganisationwill be practically completed the estimated costs rise to an average of Rs. 46 - 46crores ( 34-84 millions) a year for 10 years and thereafter drop  to  Rs. 45-81crores  ( 34-36 millions).   These  increases  are mainly  due to heavy  chargesaveraging Rs. 3 crores ( 2,250,000) a year  for renewals and replacements forwhich provision has been made in the estimates.    242.  We have explained in Chapter 7,  Section 1, of our Report that some members of the Committee wish to recommend that the air forces proposed by theCommander-in-Chief for local defence should  be increased by 2 Bomber squadrons.If this increase were made the additional estimated cost, for  which no allowance has been made in  these  estimates, would  amount to  about Rs.  1-6 crores( 1 - 2 millions) capital and Rs. 65 lakhs ( 487,000) annual maintenance.    243.  After deducting the present contribution from His Majesty&apos;s  Govern-ment under the Garran Award, India&apos;s defence expenditure for the year  1938-39is at the rate of  Rs. 46-15 crores ( 34,612,500)  per annum, an excess over thebudget provision of the.year of Rs. 97 lakhs ( 727,500).  The total of 46-15 croresis made up of Army expenditure 43-27  crores  ( 32-45 millions),  Air force -05 crores ( 1-54 millions) and Navy Rs. 83 lakhs ( 606,000).  We are assured that any attempt to increase at the present time the expenditure on defence from indian  resources  would create the  gravest political difficulties.  While we feelthat as a Committee we are not  constituted in such a  way that we are  ableto express an authoritative opinion on India&apos;s taxable capacity  or  her ability to devote a larger share of her present revenue to defence, we have been impressed by the unanimity  of views we have heard of the financial difficulties by which sheis faced.  There is a constant and emphatic demand by political parties for areduction of defence expenditure, whidh is wholly charged on  the Central Budget.It absorbs more than one-half of the revenue  of about Rs. 85 crores ( 64,000,000)raised on that Budget, which is itself about  one-half of  the total revenue raised in British India  by the Central and Provincial Governments.  The  Centre arealready pledged to find a considerable amount of new money for the Provincesin  connection *with  the constitutional  changes.  The  Provincial  governments,which are nearly all in deficit and pledged by  programmes to reduction of revenue and to  new  expenditure,  are  continually pressing for more grants from the
Centre.  There is a general consensus of1 views that it is not possible at present to widen the basis  of taxation or to  increase  substantially the yield of thepresent subjects  of  taxation.   Moreover, any  increase  of revenue  which theGovernment see their way to secure is already pledged to meet liabilities underthe devolution  schemes.  We should add that we understand that the  financialauthorities in India are examining the probable yield  of an estate duty witha view to considering the possibility of imposing new  taxation in  this form.The yield of any duty is likely to be small and would in any case accrue by law to the Provinces; but if its imposition were found possible, the force of the demandfor a reduction in the level of defence expenditure  in order to release  moneyto the Provinces should be lessened.    244.  We  have  heard some evidence on the question of the  possibility ofIndia raising a loan in the market for  defence purposes.   The political objectionsto such a course, even if it were practicable at the present time or  at  any ratein the next few years, are stated in the Government of India&apos;s letter of February1938.   We found  the  strongest views  held  in official circles  in India  that thepolitical and financial difficulties were so great as to put the matter out of thequestion; and it would appear in any case that, during the period which weare considering, recourse to this method of finding any part of the funds required would be open  to such objections as to make it impracticable.    245.  If these views  of India&apos;s  financial  position  are  accepted,  we must assume that for the present, and during the difficult  period of  the next fewyears while the financial effects of the constitutional  changes are being absorbed,India, unlike other  countries,  will be  unable, s from  her  own  resources, to meetthe increased expenditure which the modernisation of her forces entails, and mustendeavour  not  to  exceed  her present expenditure.   We must, however,  clearlyanticipate  that after this  period there will  be reasonable elasticity  in  the sumsprovided out of Indian revenues for Defence, and we do not think the responsibleauthorities  in  India would  wish to  take any other view.    246.  We have explained that the shortest period in which India can expect to complete  the reorganisation and  modernisation of her land  and air forces on  the lines which we recommend is one of five years.  During this  period  a closer study and  a more  critical examination will be made of the details  ofthe reorganisation plan day by day  as the work proceeds.  We have already suggested in Chapter 6,  Section 4, of our  Report  several  items which mightbe reconsidered.  There are also, no doubt, others which the Defence Departmentthemselves will wish  to  reconsider.  Many  of the  assumptions on  which  theestimates have been based  will be modified, and from time to time, as experience is gained of the actual costs  incurred, closer estimates  of  the final costs willbe made.    247.  If, however, India were able to reorganise and modernise her forces,then on the basis of the estimates already made, the maintenance charges  duringthe first five years  after deducting the increased annual  contribution from HisMajesty&apos;s Government of  2,000,000 from the 1st April, 1939, would be  withinthe level of the present provision for defence, provided no further improvements in the conditions of service of British forces were introduced which would involvea material increase  of expenditure in India.  // we could look forward to theperiod beyond the five years, we see at present no reason why, without any sacrifice of  efficiency or security, it should not be  possible  for india to  remain  self-supporting without any undue burden on her resources.  In the present state of world affairs five years is a very long period  over which to make forecasts.  Evenif we could anticipate so long a period of tranquillity, we prefer not to make anyforecast beyond the years immediately ahead, as we realise  that,  with  all thefinancial uncertainties in the  reorganisation  proposals,  they  would  be mostunreliable.   During  the  course of these five  years we contemplate  that  theestimated outcome of the annual maintenance charges at the end of the period of reorganisation will be re-examined from time to time as experience of the actual cost is gained.  Such alterations, if necessary, can then be made without  modifica-tion of the basic features of the proposals, as will bring the maintenance chargeswithin the level of the financial provision which the Government of India can reasonably anticipate in later years.
     248.   We should add that we strongly deprecate any suggestion that India should  make  a fixed  or maximum provision for defence  and that anything required for maintenance charges over and above that figure should be met by a variation of the contribution from His Majesty&apos;s Government.  We regard it as aaiiomatic  that,  with the help of such reasonable contribution as His Majesty&apos;s Government may make towards the cost  of India&apos;s defence forces so far as-they are satisfying what we look upon as a joint responsibility, India should meet the whole maintenance cost of her forces out of our own resources.     249.   As regards  the  net capital  cost  of  making good  deficiencies and modernising the proposed forces, the total estimated figure  of  Rs. 45-09  crores ( 33 - 8  million) must, as we have explained, be regarded as little more than a well- informed guess, and we have pointed out that, although closer estimates will be available from time to time as the work proceeds, the actual final cost will not be known until the work is nearing completion.     250.   There is little doubt, however, that a very large  capital expenditure will be  required if the  forces are to be reorganised and equipped in accordance with the proposals which we have recommended and the Ordnance Factories are to be expanded in order to make India to some extent self-sufficient in  war.  It does not appear to us that the large funds required to  meet  this expenditure  can be found out of resources at present available  in India.     251.   We have no doubt at all that the modernisation of the forces in India is a matter of the first importance and that it is essential that the work should be begun at the earliest possible moment.  If this work is not undertaken, India will be unable  to play her  proper  part in defence  and might  well become a  most embarrassing commitment in time of trouble.     252.   It is strictly not within our province to suggest how the large  funds required should be found, but we have been concerned to consider in what way, if His  Majesty&apos;s Government came to the  assistance  of India, economic spending could be assured and India could be given  the fullest  possible interest  in the expenditure.  The present methods for the control of defence expenditure appear to us to  be generally satisfactory; and we  regard it as essential that control shouldbe rigidly applied to the large new capital expenditure now contemplated,, so that there may be the closest critical examination by technical and financial officers in India of all the detailed proposals under  the scheme. But this in our view  is not enough.  We want to find, a device which would operate automatically to help tosecure the object we have in view.  We would suggest for consideration that thewhole sum ultimately required should not be given by way of grant but that someproportion of it, say one-fourth (or the excess over a fixed sum), should be advanced by way of loan, the service of which might, in view of India&apos;s  immediate financial difficulties, be postponed until modernisation had been completed.   The position could then be reviewed and arrangements come to for the liquidation of the sum advanced by way of loan. If the sum required to be liquidated were of the sizewe have in mind, and India had not to encounter further financial  troubles of  aserious kind, we do not believe there should be any  insurmountable  difficulties in providing for the service of the loan out of her current resources. There would in any case be no doubt that the ultimate liability in  India, for part of the expen- diture,  determined in the way we suggest, would  secure to  the Government of India the fullest interest in the whole of the expenditure and would enable HisMajesty&apos;s Government to provide assistance without the necessity of dual controlof expenditure..  It is also for consideration whether a further safeguard mightnot be provided by placing, an upper limit on the total amount to be advanced by way of grant and loan.
PART III. SUMMARY OP CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.              Constitutional and Political Aspects  (Chapter 1).    253.  In considering the problem set before us in our terms of reference, ithas been essential for us to acquaint ourselves with the general political situationin India, and  in particular, to endeavour to gauge the political tendencies thatseem  likely to develop with  the  introduction of Federation, seeing that our recommendations, and the  principles which govern  them,  involve a programmeextending over a number of years, and we assume that Federation will come into being within that period (paragraph 8).    254.  We have  been impressed  by the  ignorance or blindness displayed  in indian political circles as to the true facts of the position  in regard to Defence,and by the necessity of educating  Indian public opinion to a proper realisation of the strategic problems which govern the security of  the country (paragraph 12).The growing cleavage between the great Hindu and Moslem communities has beenbrought  prominently before us, and we stress its importance as a factor to  beconsidered in determining the strength and  organisation of the defence forces inIndia tar Internal Security.  The difference of outlook in defence matters betweenthe two  communities is  pronounced  (paragraph 13).  We have been  speciallyimpressed by the general anxiety  in the minds of so many of the  witnesses wehave heard, both official and non-official, as to the future, and particularly  asto whether  the safeguards relating to  Defence at the Federal Centre would  be effective  (paragraphs 16-19).    255.  We have  been able  to proceed on no other assumption than  that asettled defence policy can and will be laid down in accordance with the principlethat the responsibility for the defence of India rests with the British Government,and that this  responsibility will not be weakened whatever political pressure  is brought to bear on the Government of India either before, or after the coming  of,Federation.  This assumption appears to  us to be essential not  only  to thecontinuity of any plans based on our recommendations, but, indeed, to the making of defence plans of such a general and far-reaching nature as we have been called on  to make (paragraph 19).                    Strategical appreciation (Chapter 2).    256.  We have  reviewed the general strategical  situation  as  regards theWestern Frontier, the other land frontiers of India, and the risk to  India&apos;s sea communications; and in Chapter 4 we have emphasised the importance to india of  the great changes in the  world situation  that  have  developed in the last six years.  While the old dangers  to  India &apos;s land frontiers remain latent, newrisks both as regards Japan&apos;s aggressive attitude and the changed Mediterraneansituation have arisen which seriously threaten her external security.    257.  We conclude  that  India&apos;s  defence plans must provide not only forthe contingency of Afghan aggression and the possibility of assistance by great powers,  coupled with widespread tribal disturbance, but  also to an increasing extent for  the protection of her sea communications in Eastern waters and the strategic points which are vital to their security (paragraph  31).                     The Western Frontier (Chapter  3).The general policy and its application  (Chapter 3, Section 1).     258.   The measures taken to give effect to the  present &quot; Forward Policy &quot;of the Government of India in the tribal areas of the  Western Frontier  have avery important bearing on the defence forces of India.  We have therefore madethe widest  survey that has been possible to  us  of  the subject and have heardevidence on it from  a large number of military and  political officers.
     259.   We are disturbed  by the nature of the evidence we  have received, indicating as it does the widest difference of view among important officials as to the merits or the purposes of the measures now in operation and as to the wisest methods of achieving the aim of the Forward Policy.     260.   We recommend that very early  steps should be taken to review the Frontier Policy in its entirety  with the object not only of clarifying the policy, but also of defining the practical objectives to be aimed at and the methods by which they are to be reached  (paragraph 47).        The Employment of Air.Forces (Chapter  3, sections 2 and 3).     261.   We have dealt at some length with the question of the employment of air forces in the tribal areas on this Western Frontier as  it has in the past been the subject of controversy.  We found in the Royal Air  Force, both in  London and India, a feeling that the  air resources at the disposal of the Government of India had  not  always  been  employed in such  a way  as to secure the  most advantageous effect by the most economical method (paragraph 50).    262.   We are satisfied that there has been a notable advance in understanding in the last few years as to the use of the air forces* and we draw attention to various  measures which we hope  will promote it  still further.   We  have alsoascertained in evidence that it is the accepted policy to avoid offensive operations by land forces in circumstances which  clearly indicate that the object  in  viewcan be obtained by air action  alone (paragraphs 50-55).         The three main methods of using Air Forces in a primary role                           (Chapter 3, Section 3).    263.  We describe the various methods of using air forces in a primary roleand make certain comments thereon (paragraphs 57-63).Principles  governing the scales  of  the  forces and  the financial arrangements           between the British and Indian Governments (Chapter 4).    264.  We wish to draw particular attention to  Chapter 4 of our Report inwhich we have discussed fully the principles which in our opinion should govern the scales of the defence forces in India and the financial arrangements  betweenthe British Government  and the  Government of India.    We recommend:       (i) That  the  broad lines of  division  between  Indian and Imperial           responsibility for defence and the distinction between the &apos;&apos;  minor &apos;&apos;           and  the  &quot;major  danger&quot;  drawn  in the  Garran  Tribunal report           should no  longer be applied to  determine the respective liabilities of           the two Governments  (paragraph 69).     (ii) That  the external  defence of India should be regarded  as  a joint           responsibility of the two Governments and that the financial arrange-           ments between them should be based on the principle that India should           bear a share  in  the joint responsibility and that  these arrangements           should as  far as is financially  possible  give  effect  to  the principle           (paragraph 69).    (iii) That,  in addition to the forces required for the local defence of India,           forces should be maintained in India to assist in her external  defence,           and that these forces, although  maintained by India  for the purposes           of the joint responsibility, should form an integral part of the forces           of India as a whole. We deprecate the use of a title such as &apos;&apos; Imperial           Reserve,&quot;  implying  as  it does a  distinction between  Indian and           Imperial  responsibilities  which  we wish  to avoid in  this connection           (paragraph 71).* See note by A.ir Marshal Courtney appended to the Report.
                                                                          1 P o                                    61          That the defence plans of the two Governments should be co-ordinated           and merged in the general war plans which would prescribe the use           and duties of the forces in India,  We recognise  that there may be           occasions as in the past when (he Government of India may be ready           and willing to make forces available for purposes going beyond the           ieeat defence of India  (paragraphs 73 and 74).          That in accordance with the principle of joint responsibility and having           regard to the strength and composition of the forces proposed, the           subsidy now paid by the British  Government  to India  under the           Garran Award  might reasonably be continued at  the higher level of            2,000,000 a year (paragraph 75).          That if forces held in India for her external defence are used outside           India for that  purpose  their ordinary  maintenance charges should           continue to be  borne by  India;  and the apportionment of the  extra           charges between Imperial and Indian funds should be agreed by the           two Governments at the time, regard being had to all the circumstances           of the emergency  (paragraph  75).                                War Plans.    265.  We recommend that the plans for the use of armed forces in the defenceof India  in war should as  a  matter of course be the subject of the closestconsultation  between the defence authorities in India and  the Committee ofImperial  Defence before the approval of the two Governments;  and we areinformed  that  the  Government  of  India  would  welcome the  suggestion(paragraph 76).                 The reorganisation proposals (Chapter 5).    266.  We relate that in the  summer of 1938  the Commander-in-Chief hadinitiated a new and comprehensive review of India&apos;s local defence requirements in respect of all three defence services.  The results were placed before  us inevidence and we have discussed them in close touch with the Commander-in-Chief,who has made several important modifications in his proposals as a  result ofour joint  consultations.  The &quot; proposals &quot; to which  we refer throughout therest of the Report are the proposals so modified (paragraphs 78 and 79).                The reorganisation of the Army (Chapter 6).    267.  We recall that the Chiefs of  Staff and the Cabinet Committee had stressed the  importance of  placing  India&apos;s  defence organisation  on  a  moreup-to-date and satisfactory basis.  We have regarded this as a mandate,  as is indeed implied in our terms of reference (paragraph 84).    268.  At  the outset we examined the possibility of organising  the troopsin India into  separate specialised bodies, and give our reasons for rejecting it(paragraphs 86 and 87).    269.  Our conclusion is that the whole of  the  troops in  India should bemodernised on a practically uniform scale both on  general grounds and becauseof the need for ensuring that the British forces in India are interchangeable withthose on the Imperial establishment (paragraphs 88 and 89).   We consider thatif this work is not undertaken India will be unable to play her proper part in defence  and might  well become a  most embarrassing commitment in time of trouble  (paragraph 251).    270.  The  strategic  assumption  underlying  the  Commander-in-Chiefsproposal is that in an Empire war, unless the situation is particularly favourable,no large-scale offensive operations will be undertaken against the tribes on theIndian side of the Durand Line, or across it against Afghan troops and tribes.On this basis we recommend acceptance of the general purport of the Commander-in-Chiefs proposals  which is:       (i)  to assess the troops required as a safe minimum in  war for the purely           local defence of India on the assumption that the whole of these forces           will be modernised;(V)(vi)
      (ii)  to modernise them accordingly on a scale generally resembling that           adopted for troops on the Imperial establishment;     (iii)  to distribute these modernised troops on a new basis;     (iv)  out  of the surplus that will then remain to retain a number of troops           which will be available for purposes other than purely local defence;      (v)  to modernise this number of troops on a somewhat higher scale than is           proposed for the forces required for local defence;     (vi)  to deal with any  balance that may still remain by withdrawing the           British units and reducing the Indian units for which employment           cannot be provided in oversea garrisons (paragraphs 85 and 90).                       Proposed allotment of troops.     271.  The new  categories which  replace  the  former  &quot;Field  Army,&quot;&quot;Covering Troops.&quot; and &quot;Internal Security Troops&quot; are &quot;Frontier defence troops,&quot;  &quot;Internal  Security Troops,&quot;  &quot;Coast  Defence Troops &quot;  and  &quot;TheGeneral Reserve.&quot;   Their  respective  functions are  briefly described in  para-graph 92; the proposed allotment of  troops to the new  categories  is given inparagraph 99;  and that of the  remaining surplus (see  paragraph 270 (iv)above) in paragraph 100.     We recommend that the proposed allotment of troops to the above categoriesshould be  accepted (paragraph 107).                             Internal Security.     272.  We have  given particular attention to  the proposed strength of theInternal Security troops.  At our request the proposals have been  communicatedto the Provincial Governors, and we have been informed that  they regard them as generally satisfactory.  We accept the assurance  of the Commander-in-Chiefthat the proposed allotment will provide an adequate minimum insurance againstthe &quot;worst contingency &quot; a world war accompanied by hostilities on the frontier and widespread civil unrest on the necessary assumption that we can rely on thecontinued loyalty of  the Indian Army and need not contemplate any widespreaddisaffection among the police (paragraph 106).                         External Defence Troops.     273.  We have considered  the suggestion of the General Staff in India for providing a reserve available for purposes other than the local defence of India;and we regard them as providing the requisite strength for what  we term &quot; the external Defence Troops.&quot;     On the hypothesis that  the War Office may now ask for the  withdrawal ofone  British Cavalry regiment and  two  British Infantry battalions from India.in addition to those already withdrawn, we recommend that the Cavalry and infantry components of the  External Defence troops should consist of 1 BritishCavalry regiment,  and  3  British and  7  Indian Infantry  battalions  (para-graph 111).                     Withdrawal and reduction of units.     274.  On  this hypothesis, the total number of British units to be  withdrawnfrom India would be  1  Cavalry regiment,  3 Royal  Horse Artillery batteries,1  Field Artillery regiment, 1  Medium  Artillery  regiment  and 2  infantry battalions (paragraphs 112 and 113).     275.  A total of 3 Indian  Cavalry  regiments, 4 companies of Sappers and miners, and 14 Indian Infantry battalions would  have to be reduced unless aswe hope  would be  possible employment can  be found  for  them  in overseagarrisons  (paragraph 119).  We conclude that the necessity for reductions mustbe faced and accepted, and that we have no option but to recommend accordingly(paragraph 120).
                  Equipment of the  Local  Defence Troops.    276.  We deal in Section 4 with the proposals for the equipment of  thetroops required  for local defence, and  we recommend that,  subject to certaincomments, they should be accepted  (paragraph 123).    277.  We are of opinion that the composition proposed for a Cavalry brigadein the General Reserve might be further considered (paragraph 124).                         Suggestions for Economies.    278.  We note a number of measures in regard to which improvements oreconomies may be found possible when the scheme as a whole is  further reviewed by the defence authorities in  India  (paragraph 126 and Appendix Y).                 Equipment of  the External Defence Troops.    279.  We recommend approval of the somewhat higher scale of equipmentproposed for the External Defence troops (paragraph 137 and Appendix IY).                        Time-table of  Modernisation.    280.  We recommend that the proposal to complete modernisation in 5 years should be accepted and  that the time-table referred to in Section 5 should beadopted.  We call particular attention  to the need for placing early  orders forthe equipment of the External Defence Troops whose requirements would be given priority (paragraph 143).            Major savings effected  by the modernisation proposals.    281.  We tabulate in Section 6 the major heads under which savings are tobe anticipated as the result  of the reorganisation and modernisation proposals(paragraph 145).                            Office establishments.    282.  We deal in Section 8 with the possibilities  of effecting economies inthe  office  establishments  connected  with  the  defence  organisation  (para-graphs 151-158).              Conditions of service of British troops in India.    283.  We review in  Section 9 the conditions of service of British troops inIndia, and conclude that they may be considered generally satisfactory, havingregard to Indian  conditions, though the standard of barrack  accommodationshould be brought up to date  as funds  become available.  We discuss the questionof reducing the term- of service in India  to 4 years  (paragraphs  159-163).                The Strength of the Air Forces  (Chapter 7).    284.  The question of the strength of the air forces required for the local defence of India has proved  one of considerable difficulty.  On reaching India,we found that the defence authorities had reconsidered the strategical plan forthe conduct of war with  Afghanistan.  They do not now regard as essential theproposal which  the Chiefs of Staff had  had before them for  a  vigorous and sustained air offensive against that  country from the outset of the war.  In viewof this  change of plan  the  Commander-in-Chief  considers that the minimum requirements for local defence would  be satisfied  by  the provision of  4  bomber squadrons, 3 Army Co-operation squadrons  and 1 Bomber  Transport squadron,two of the Bomber squadrons having a primary role of Coast Defence, but being available on the Frontier  if not needed or when no longer needed  for coast defence(paragraphs 164-167).
    28S.  We have based our,.financial  appreciation of  the defence forces as awhole on these proposals of the Commander-in-Chief  so far as local defence isconcerned,  and on the provision of  two further  Bomber  squadrons which  werecommend  as India&apos;s share  of the joint  responsibility  for  external defence(paragraphs 182 and 183).    286.  We have,  however, been unable to reach agreement among ourselves on the number of Bomber squadrons  which should be provided for local defence and our differing views are explained in paragraphs 169  and 170.  We have pointed out that if, as we propose, all strategic plans affecting India are the subjectof early consultation between the Commander-in-Chief  and the Committee  ofImperial Defence, and if approval by the  two Governments were given to  an alteration of  the plan after  such  consultation,  some  reconsideration  of  thestrength and composition of the forces might be required.    287.  We recommend that  the proposed organisation and  equipment of  theair forces as  explained in Chapter  7,  Section 2, should be  approved  (para-graph 181).    288.  We recommend that the  supply difficulty arising out of  the longercycle of re-equipment adopted  for Army Co-operation and Bomber transport aircraft should be investigated by the Defence Department in consultation withthe Air Minister at an early date (paragraph 175).    289.  We suggest that it should be confirmed that  India&apos;s relatively smallrequirements of aircraft  and engines in war can be  met out of  Air Ministryreserves (paragraph  177).          Reorganisation of the Royal  Indian Navy (Chapter 8).    290.  Our recommendations for the reorganisation of the Royal Indian Navyare set  out in this Chapter.  They are based on  the agreement reached by  theBritish  and  Indian  Governments  and announced  in  January  1938.  Theprincipal  recommendations  to  which  we  draw  attention here  are for  theconstruction of four  &quot; Bittern &quot; class escort vessels, the rearming of &quot; Indus &quot;and. &quot; Hindustan &quot;  and the completion of local  naval defence measures.  the detailed recommendations are summarised in paragraph 198.                        Coast Defence  (Chapter 9).    291.  In addition to  the provision of the two Bomber squadrons  with adual role of Frontier duties and coast defence, we recommend the provision olcoast defence and anti-aircraft artillery at the principal ports.  We assume thatthe danger to the ports will probably disappear when commerce raiders have beenrounded up in the first few months of the war (paragraph 201) ;  and we considerthat the provision of 6-inch guns on modern mountings should suffice to  deterattempts to  bombard the ports  so long as the scale of attack is no higher thanthat of  a cruiser  or  armed merchant vessel operating some thousands of  milesfrom its base  (paragraph 202).  We recommend  these measures as providing areasonable  minimum insurance;  and on that basis  we do not  propose that.2-inch guns, of which the cost would  be very  heavy, should be  installed  atBombay (paragraph 203).  We recommend the provision of 3-inch anti-aircraft guns at the principal ports, and we assume that steps will be taken to ensurethe supply of the small number required from stocks available in the  UnitedKingdom (paragraphs 209 and 210).  We summarise our recommendations inparagraph 212.                      Ordnance Factories  (Chapter 10).    292.  We discuss in this  Chapter the proposals  which were made by  theGovernment of India to reorganise and expand their Ordnance Factories  so asto make India as  far  as  practicable self-sufficient in  war in the supply  ofmunitions.   The policy underlying these proposals had already been consideredby the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, who had advised its adoption.
6517    293.  We have examined the possibility of enlisting private  enterprise toassist in the production of munitions in India, and we have also considered thealternative course to  production in India of relying  on purchase outside thecountry and the accumulation of large reserves.    294.  We recommend that the proposals of the defence  authorities set outin paragraph 229 for the reorganisation and expansion of seven of the existingfactories and the construction of a new  factory for the  manufacture of T.N.T.should be adopted.           S    295.  We  also recommend  that  consideration  should  be  given to  theco-ordination of these proposals with any  similar plans that are  contemplated in other parts of the Empire (paragraph 234).    296.  The capital  cost of our  recommendations is  necessarily extremelyconjectural, but on the most reliable estimates which are possible at the presenttime it will amount to over  30 millions.  It does not appear to us that the funds to meet this expenditure can be found out of the resources  at present availablein India (paragraph 250).    297.  If assistance could be given to India to enable her to meet the capital cost of reorganising and modernising her forces as we propose, it is estimatedthat the maintenance charges during the first five years  after  deducting theincreased  annual contribution from His Majesty&apos;s  Government of  2,000,000from the 1st April, 1939, would be within the level of the present provision for defence, provided no further improvements in the conditions of service of british forces were introduced which would involve a material increase of expenditure inIndia; and we see at present  no reason  why it should not be possible for Indiato  remain  self-supporting without  any  undue  burden on  her resources(paragraph 247).    298.  We regard it as axiomatic that  with  the help of such  reasonablecontribution as His Majesty&apos;s Government may make towards the cost of India&apos;defence forces, so far as they are  satisfying  what  we  look upon as  a  joint responsibility of the two Governments, India should meet the whole maintenancecost of her forces out of her own resources (paragraph 248).    299.  We cannot conclude our Report without referring to our Secretary,Mr. S. K. Brown, C.B., C.V.O., whose knowledge of India&apos;s problems has been of so great an assistance  to us  throughout our enquiry.  He  has taken a  mostimportant part in framing our Report and we  cannot speak too highly of theinvaluable help he has afforded us in this respect.    The ground  we have had to cover has been  great, while the  time  at our disposal has been strictly limited; in consequence he  and our able assistant secretary, Mr. M. J. Dean, to whom we are also most grateful, have had to work under great pressure.    We must also refer to Mr. A. J. Newling, M.V.O., T.D., of the War Office,Major P. R. Antrobus, M.C., R.E., of the General Staff in India, and PaymasterCaptain R.  C. Jerram,  C.B.E., D.S.O., R.N., who have been  attached to us forthe purpose of our enquiry  Their special knowledge and their careful work havebeen of  the greatest assistance to us.    It would have been impossible for us to have  produced our Report in so short a period had it not been for the zeal with which all  concerned have carried out their most arduous duties.    We wish to express our gratitude to them.Finance (Chapter 11).(Signed)CHATFIELD.E.  J.  STROHMENGER.B.  SERGISON-BROOKE.C.  L.  COURTNEY.C. J. E. AUCHINLECK.S. K. BROWN.M.  J.

  NOTE  BY AIR MARSHAL  COURTNEY ON PARAGRAPH 50  OF  THE  REPORT.  ;    1.  I feel that the above paragraph of our Report dealing with the employ-ment of air forces on the Western Frontier may give the impression that, though this subject may have given rise to justifiable criticisms in the past, the positionnow is as satisfactory as can reasonably be expected.  It is because I  ani unableto subscribe to such a conclusion that I find it necessary to make this reservation.    2.  The Committee refer to a feeling which exists in the Royal Air Force inIndia that &quot; the air resources at the disposal of the Government have  not alwaysbeen employed in such a way as to secure the most advantageous effect by the most economical method.&quot;   In my opinion, this contention is not without foundation.I do not, of course, suggest that it  applies to all air operations; on the contrary,it is clear that aircraft have been successfully used in a primary role on a numberof occasions during the recent operations.        .    3.  I gladly recognise this fuller use made of the Royal Air Force on theFrontier  during the recent Waziristan operations and the improved under-standing that has resulted.   I also share the hope that the measures referred toby the Committee in this section of the Report will help to cement this underrstanding.  But  I do not consider that there  are adequate grounds for the belief that these measures alone will remove the difficulty.    4.  I do not think it is unreasonable to say that under the present defence organisation  criticism of the kind described is likely  to persist,  together witha feeling that there is a tendency to incline to the older forms of military pressure.Consideration of the organisation for the higher direction of defence is not within our terms of reference, but I may perhaps be permitted to express the view thatthe best use of India&apos;s air forces will not be achieved without some change in thepresent machinery.(Signed)      C. L. COURTNEY.
APPENDIX  I.     DETAILED REQUIREMENTS IN LAND FORCES  FOR THE  DEFENCE OF  THE                            WESTERN FRONTIER.                (Referred to in paragraph 99 of the Report.)    1.   THE allotment of troops recommended in this Appendix is based on thefollowing assumptions : &apos;     (i) That in an Empire war, unless the situation is particularly favourable,          no large-scale offensive operations will be undertaken against the tribes          on the Indian  side of the Durand Line, or across it  against Afghan          troops and tribes, but that the task of the Frontier  Defence troops          will be confined to maintaining the existing situation in the face of          tribal aggression and to resisting Afghan invasion. .     (ii) That it is necessary to  provide in each of the four Frontier Military          Districts, adequate regular land forces to meet the daily peace-time          requirements of watch and ward in  the unadministered  tribal areas          included in them.    (iii) That there will be at all times, in peace and war, at the immediate and r         unconditional disposal of the General  Officer  Commanding-in-Chief,          Northern Command,  a reserve of ^regular troops  adequate to enable v . .      - him to restore a local situation or to meet an unforeseen emergency.   . (iv) That additional regular troops, suitably organised and equipped for the h.        purpose, will be available,  if required, from  the General Reserve to - -!        carry out counter-offensives to relieve the Frontier  Defence troops          should the pressure on these become unduly severe.    The allotment of troops  recommended for each  of  the  Frontier Military,Districts, and brief reasons for these recommendations  are  set  out District byDistrict in the succeeding paragraphs.                             .2. Peshawar District.             ....                                 -    (i)  It is vital to hold Peshawar, the capital and most important town of theNorth-West Frontier Province. The most direct line of attack on Peshawar is bythe Khyber Pass.    (ii) Peshawar may also  be threatened by  an Afridi incursion across  theKhajuri Plain,  and by a Mohmand invasion between the Swat and the Kabulrivers.   To guard against the former, it is considered that the  present fortifiedposts on the Khajuri Plain must be held, and to  counter the latter  in the most economical manner possible it is proposed that a Mohmand Blockade Line, comsisting of a wire obstacle, should be erected from Abazai to Michni and guarded bytroops as was done in 1916. Two infantry battalions supported by armoured car sand some artillery could, it is considered, hold this obstacle if it is efficientlylighted  and electrified.  The obstacle need be erected only when the emergencyarises,  but the requisite stores should be held at Peshawar, or forward of it, inpeace (c/., Appendix VI, A, item 20).    (iii) For the local protection of the cantonment and the maintenance of  lawand order in Peshawar City,  a minimum of one  infantry battalion is.likely to berequired at  all times.  In addition a mobile column of three infantry battalionswith some artillery should be located there in peace to support the  garrisons in theKhyber or on the Khajuri Plain should the need arise; and there should also be a fifth infantry battalion available to form part of the garrison of the  MohmandBlockade Line.  As it is possible that the need for reinforcing  the  Khyber  andKhajuri garrisons may  arise  simultaneously a second eolumn of  similar strengthshould be stationed at Nowshera; the second infantry battalion required to com-plete the garrison of the Mohmand obstacle could be suitably placed at Risalpur.A secondary role for the Nowshera column, should it not be required to move toPeshawar, would be to support the Malakand garrison or  to strengthen  theMohmand Blockade Line.
     (iv)  It is considered that an infantry battalion must be provided to garrisonChakdara and Malakand.     (v) Since Chitral is of no military importance, the present garrison shouldbe withdrawn, and this is already under active consideration.     (vi)  As a result of the foregoing survey, it is intended that the permanentallotment of troops to the Peshawar District should be :       Khyber (including Khajuri garrison).         1  brigade headquarters.         6  infantry battalions  (1 British, 5 Indian).         1  mountain artillery battery.     Peshawar.         1  brigade headquarters.         1  Indian cavalry armoured regiment.         2  mountain artillery batteries.  .         5  infantry battalions (1 British, 4 Indian).     Nowshera (including Malakand).         1  brigade headquarters.         2  troops field artillery.         5  infantry battalions (1 British, 4 Indian).     In addition it is considered that the Commander should have at his disposala District  Reserve comprising a medium artillery battery, two troops  of fieldartillery  and one mountain artillery battery.     It will be noted  that it is proposed  that  the horsed cavalry regiment nowstationed in Peshawar, should be replaced  by an armoured regiment.  The reasonsfor this are that, as has already been indicated, armoured cars will be requiredfor the Mohmand Blockade Line, and that light tanks and armoured cars can beemployed with advantage both on the Khajuri Plain and for the protection of thelines of communication between Peshawar  and Landi Kotal.  It is considered that two field companies of Sappers and Miners should be located in the District.     (vii) To  sum up, the total permanent allotment of troops recommended forthe Peshawar District in peace and  war  is : &apos;         3  brigade headquarters.         1  Indian cavalry armoured regiment.         1  field  artillery regiment.         1  mountain  artillery regiment.         1  medium artillery battery.         2  field  companies,  Sappers and  Miners.         3  British infantry battalions.       13  Indian infantry battalions.     (viii) Owing to the relatively small size of the District and the strength ofthe  permanent  garrison  recommended,  the  only  immediate  reinforcementconsidered  necessary  to provide  in  war  is one Indian States Forces infantry battalion to replace the regular Indian  infantry battalion stationed at Risalpur,which is an important air base requiring a permanent garrison for its protection.3. Kohat District.     (i) In  this  district the two  vital points are Kohat itself and Thai.  Theformer is the headquarters of the civil district, the broad gauge railhead, and the site of an important  aerodrome; while Thai is the narrow gauge railhead andstrategically important from  the points  of view  of road communications withWaziristan and  Parachinar, and of the  routes leading from  Afghanistan towardsthe Kurram Valley and Kohat.  Each of  these stations should have a permanentgarrison of sufficient  strength to furnish  a mobile column of  not less than threebattalions of infantry and a battery of  artillery.     (ii)  In the  event  of war the chief threats are likely to  consist in  Afghanoffensives against Parachinar or Thai,  tribal incursions  from Tirah  towardsKohat itself, or against the road from Kohat to Thai, and  tribal interferencewith direct communication with  Peshawar by the  Kohat Pass which  lies  inunadministered  tribal territory.
    (iii) Owing to its isolated strategic position and the difficulty of maintainingit, the detachment in war of regular troops to Parachinar is to be avoided ifpossible, and the Thai mobile column may not be always available  to reinforce the Kurram Militia  garrison at that place.   At  the  same  time,  it may  beimperative to provide help at- short notice, and, for this reason  among others, an indian  armoured regiment should be permanently located in Kohat.  If  notrequired to operate in the Kurram  Valley, it is likely to be of great value in helping to keep open  communications from Kohat towards Peshawar and  Thai,as well  as between Thai and  Mir Ali in Waziristan.    (iv) To stem a serious tribal incursion from Tirah the entire Kohat mobilecolumn  is likely to be needed, and its strength might well have to be augmented.-For this reason, and to provide a reserve in the hands of the District Commander,it is proposed  that, on the outbreak of war with Afghanistan, an immediatereinforcement of an infantry brigade with two troops of field artillery should besent to  Kohat.   In addition,  an extra infantry battalion is likely to be requiredfor the  protection of the railway bridge at Khushalgarh, and of the  railway linethence to Kohat, which  is flanked by tribal territory on the north.    (v)  One field  company  of  Sappers  and  Miners  should be stationedpermanently in the district, and it is also proposed that the Commander shouldhave an additional mountain artillery battery in the District Reserve.    (vi) As the result of the foregoing survey, the following allotment of troops for this District is proposed :     (a) Permanent Garrison.         Kohat.             1 brigade  headquarters.             1 Indian cavalry axmoured  regiment.             2 mountain  artillery batteries.             1 field company Sappers and Miners  (less detachment  at Thai).             4 Indian infantry battalions.         Thai.             1 brigade headquarters.             1 mountain  artillery battery.             Detachment  field company Sappers and Miners.             4 Indian infantry battalions.    (b) Immediate Reinforcements.             1 brigade headquarters.             2 troops field artillery.             4 infantry battalions  (1 British, 2 Indian and  1 Indian States                   Forces).    (vii)  To sum up, the total allotment recommended for the district in war is:              3 brigade headquarters.             1 Indian cavalry armoured  regiment.             2 troops field artillery.             3 mountain  artillery batteries.             1 field company, Sappers and Miners.             1 British  infantry battalion.            10 Indian infantry battalions.             1 Indian States Forces infantry battalion.4. Waziristan  District.    ii)  In order to hold  Razmak and Wana it is necessary  to maintain  them.Wana  could,  if necessary, be maintained by air,  but for the  maintenance ofRazmak it would be essential  to ensure the  regular movement of mechanical transport convoys forward of Bannu, and this would entail keeping the road fromBannu  to Razmak reasonably safe for military traffic.    (ii) For ordinary daily watch and ward  duties in  normal times of peace, thetroops allotted to the district should be capable of providing three mobile columns,each of the size of a brigade group, and, in addition, of  finding adequate garrisonsfor Bannu, Mir Ali, Razmak, Wana and  Manzai.   The present  columns at
Razmak and Wana are of adequate strength, but experience has shown that theBannu column requires an extra infantry battalion,  and it is proposed that thisshould be added to the permanent garrison.     (iii) Bannu must be held at all times as it is  the  headquarters  of  a civilDistrict and  a railhead.  For its static defence a  minimum  garrison  of  one infantry battalion is necessary.                                            -  &apos;   (iv) Mir  Ali is of considerable  strategic importance,  and, being  a  roadjunction, is a suitable base  for the operations of mobile columns.    It should,therefore, be held by regular troops.     (v) Two infantry battalions are needed to defend Razmak  and its outlyingposts during the absence from the station of the mobile column.     (vi) For the static defence of Wana, in the absence of the mobile column,rather less than one infantry battalion is necessary.     (vii) The reasons for holding Mahzai are that it is  a railhead, and also themost suitable  base for aircraft employed in maintaining  Wana.   It is, moreover,.a halting place for convoys.  . The retention  there of one infantry  battalion isconsidered necessary.     (viii) Some armoured fighting vehicles at least a squadron will be required at all times in Waziristan for convoy and reconnaissance duties, and in time ofwar this allotment  is likely to have to be increased to a  complete regiment.  an indian cavalry armoured regiment should, therefore,  form part of the permanentgarrison of the District.                                      -     (ix) It is also  considered  that a complete battery of medium artillery andtwo field companies,  Sappers and Miners, should be permanently located  in theDistrict.     (x) In war, it  is essential, as has  already been explained, to keep open theroad Bannu-Razmak, and for  this purpose,  it is considered that ten infantry battalions are necessary, distributed as follows :             Bannu  ...    ...     ...  ....     ...     1  battalion. .            Mir Ali (including the Shinki Defile)     2  battalions.            Idak    ...    ...     ...     ...     ...     1  battalion.            Thai    ...    ...     ...     ...     ...     1  battalion.             Damdil... . lV ...     ...    ...     ...     2  battalions.            Dosali  ... &apos;  &apos;       &apos; i;r  -  ...     ...     1  battalion.            Razani  ...    ...                  ...     2  battalions.     These  units should be supported by two troops of field artillery.     The above  force would be  too large to be controlled by one brigade  head-quarters, and it is considered that a,second will be necessary.  The Bannu brigade headquarters  with  its four infantry battalions  and mountain artillery  batterymight  form part of the line of  communication troops,  and it is proposed that thebalance should be detailed in peace as immediate reinforcements for  the district and should consist of                                                vu\             1 brigade headquarters,            2 troops field artillery,            3 infantry battalions (1 British, 2 Indian),with an additional 3 unbrigaded battalions, of which two might be regular Indianinfantry battalions, and the third an Indian States Forces battalion.     (xi) Since it is  the intention to adopt  a defensive attitude, any idea ofexpeditions far  afield for punitive purposes must, in the circumstances envisaged,be discarded.  On the other hand,  opportunities may occur from  time to time ofinflicting severe losses on tribal gatherings adjacent to  the  main lines,of com-munication, and it may be necessary on occasion to employ troops as well asaircraft to relieve hostile pressure on an isolated post or  garrison. With regardto these Scouts posts, the experiences of 1919 indicate that, in general, it wouldbe impolitic to evacuate them except as a last resort, though it must be recognisedthat it may be advisable to evacuate a post which is particularly exposed, such asthat at Datta Khel.  The abandonment of Miranshah with its  landing ground,Royal  Air Force installations,  and important political administrative centre isnot contemplated.     The two mobile  columns permanently available  for  offensive operations arethose at Wana and Razmak.  The scope of action of the Wana column must, from
 force of circumstances, be relatively small, so that the, brunt of these operations will fall on the Razmak column.  It is considered essential, therefore, in war to provide an additional infantry brigade group on an all pack transport basis to form an emergency reserve in the hands of the District Commander.         &apos;-.     (xii)  Finally, it is considered that in war the general control of operations in the District should be exercised by  District headquarters, but that a striking force headquarters might be required as part of  the reinforcing troops.  The function of this second headquarters would be to control any operations in which two or more mobile columns were operating in close conjunction.     (xiii)  As a result of the foregoing survey, it is proposed that the allotment of troops to the Waziristan District should be :-     (a) Permanent Garrison.     .                     .                     ,         Bannu.             1 brigade headquarters,             2 Indian infantry battalions.

Detachment field company, Sappers and Miners. :             2 Indian infantry battalions.        Rasmak.             1 brigade headquarters.             1 armoured car squadron of an Indian cavalry armoured regiment.          -  2 mountain artillery batteries.-                                 &apos; &apos;             1 medium artillery battery.             1 field company, Sappers and Miners (less detachment at Mir Ali).             6 infantry battalions (1 British, 5 Indian).         Wana.             1 brigade headquarters.             2 mountain artillery batteries.             1 field  company,  Sappers and  Miners.             4 Indian infantry  battalions.        Manzai.                                                           J             1 Indian infantry  battalion.        Dera Ismail Khan.             1 Indian cavalry armoured regiment (less 1 armoured car squadron                 at Razmak).    (b) Immediate Reinforcements.             1 striking  force headquarters.             2 brigade headquarters.             2 troops  field artillery.             2 mountain artillery batteries.             1 field company, Sappers and  Miners.             9 infantry battalions (2 British, 6 Indian  and 1 Indian States                 Forces).    (xiv) To sum up, the total number of  troops which might be required ih warin Waziristan is : -             1 District headquarters.             1 striking  force headquarters.             5 brigade headquarters.             1 Indian cavalry armoured  regiment.             2 troops  field artillery.             1 medium artillery battery.             7 mountain artillery batteries.             3 field companies, Sappers  and Miners.             3 British infantry  battalions.           20 Indian infantry battalions.             1 Indian States Forces infantry battalion.
5.  Northern Command Reserve.    In  the foregoing paragraphs, the needs  of the three Frontier MilitaryDistricts of the Northern  Command have: been  considered separately, and  an allotment of troops to form the permanent garrison, and to provide &apos;&apos; immediatereinforcements &quot; in war or grave emergency, has been recommended for each ofthem.  The permanent garrison of each District will  generally remain constant,though units of it  may be temporarily moved from one District1 to another at the discretion  of  the  General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,  Northern  Command.The &quot; immediate reinforcements &quot; recommended,  though calculated on a Districtbasis, will  not necessarily be sent automatically  to the Districts to which theyare allocated  in theory, but would, in practice,  be held at the disposal of theGeneral  Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command, who would  dispose of them in  accordance with the needs of the general situation.    In addition to the units which have been included in the allotment of troopsrecommended as necessary for the several Districts under the head of &quot; immediatereinforcements&quot; it is considered that the  undermentioned units should also beincluded in the Northern Command Reserve :               1 field  artillery regiment.             1 mountain artillery regiment (less two batteries).             1 field park company, Sappers and Miners.             2 field  companies, Sappers and Miners.             1 infantry brigade (1 British and 2 Indian battalions).    The total number of units in the reserve at the disposal of the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command, would be  therefore :               1 striking Force  headquarters.             4 brigade headquarters.             2 field  artillery regiments.             1 mountain artillery regiment.             1 field park company, Sappers and  Miners.             3 field companies, Sappers and Miners.            16 infantry battalions (4  British,  10 Indian  and 2 Indian States                 Forces).6.  Western District (exclusive of Sind Brigade Area).    (1)  Quetta must be held  and the  Zhob  must  be protected from tribalincursions.  Quetta is not only the seat of Government but possesses  a largecantonment with many important military installations.  The direct approach toQuetta from Afghanistan is over the Khojak Pass, a  readily defensible position which must, it is considered, be held  in order to ensure the security of  Quetta.An infantry brigade  of not less than three battalions with attached troops isprobably the minimum force required for this task.    (ii)  A detachment at Chaman is militarily unsound, and from this point ofview  it  is eminently desirable  that the cantonment there should be abandoned.Under the old plan of operations a garrison at Chaman was necessary to protect the railhead and  the advanced base  installations essential  for  the projectedadvance on Kandahar.  In a defensive war a detachment at Chaman would be a highly dangerous and unprofitable commitment.    (iii) An additional infantry brigade group is necessary as a District reserve in Quetta  itself, either to reinforce the defence of  the Khojak  or  to  operateindependently in other directions from which threats may materialise.    (iv)  In the Zhob Valley,  Fort Sandeman  is the centre of the  politicaladministration and must be held.  To ensure this and to maintain the situationin the Zhob Valley generally a mobile column  of three infantry battalions anda mountain battery is the minimum force required; and an additional battalionis necessary for the local defence of Fort Sandeman itself when the mobile columnis  absent.  It is proposed  that a squadron of  armoured cars should be locatedthere also.   Distances in  the  Zhob are great,  and the area is reasonably wellprovided with roads and  suitable generally to the  employment of  armouredvehicles. Tort Sandeman  must be maintained normally from Quetta  and an indian cavalry armoured regiment would be invaluable should convoy protectionbe necessary.  There  is considered to  be scope for such a unit in Baluchistangenerally, and it is proposed  therefore that one should be stationed at Quettawith  a detached squadron at Fort Sandeman.
     (v) It is also necessary to  provide for the protection of railway  and road communications  between Sibi  and Quetta,  through the Bolan Pass,  and to provide static protection for Quetta itself when the mobile reserve is absent.     (vi) Owing to the  isolation of Baluchistan from the rest of India, and the fact that the railway communications are susceptible to interruption by flood and earthquake, it is proposed  that the undermentioned additional units should be permanently located there in order that they may be immediately available in an emergency : ?                     *             1 field artillery regiment.             1 medium artillery battery.             1 mountain artillery battery  (to complete the mountain  artillery                 regiment).             1 field park company, Sappers and Miners.     (vii) As the result of  the foregoing survey, the troops required in  peace in the Western District (exclusive of Sind Brigade Area) are :      (a) Permanent Garrison.         Quetta.             2 brigade headquarters.             1 Indian  cavalry armoured  regiment (less one armoured  car                 squadron at Fort Sandeman).             1 field artillery regiment.             1 mountain artillery regiment (less one battery).             1 medium artillery battery (See Note below).             2 field companies, Sappers and Miners (less detachment at Fort                 Sandeman).             1 field park company, Sappers and Miners.             1 British infantry battalion.             5 Indian  infantry battalions.         (NOTE. If it should be found inconvenient to station a medium artillery             battery permanently  in Quetta,  it  should  be  included  in  the             &quot; immediate reinforcements.&quot;)        Khojak  Pass.             1 Indian  infantry battalion.        Fort Sandeman.             1 brigade headquarters.             1 armoured car squadron of an Indian cavalry armoured regiment.             1 mountain artillery  battery.             Detachment, field company, Sappers and Miners.             4 Indian  infantry battalions.     (b) Immediate Reinforcements.             In the event of war with Afghanistan the following immediate        reinforcements should  be  provided for  the protection of  the  lines of        communication between Sibi and Quetta and of Quetta itself :              3 Indian States Forces infantry battalions.     (viii)  To sum up, the total allotment in war for the District is therefore :              3 brigade headquarters.             1 Indian  cavalry armoured regiment.             .1 field artillery regiment.             1 mountain artillery  regiment.             1 medium artillery battery.             1 field park company, Sappers  and  Miners.             2 field companies, Sappers and Miners.             1 British  infantry battalion.            10 Indian infantry battalions.             3 Indian States Forces infantry battalions.     Should it be necessary  further  to reinforce this District, the troops required would be drawn from the General Reserve.      [18631!                                                        L
APPENDIX  IPLAND FORCES REQUIRED FOR COAST DEFENCE  (REFERRED TO  IN  PARAGRAPH 99).     1.  THE total allotment  of  troops  proposed for the defence of the fourprincipal ports  of Bombay,  Calcutta, Karachi and  Madras, and, if necessary,in emergency to  furnish small garrisons for the ports of Cochin and Vizagapatamas well as to provide the garrison of Port Blair  in the  Andaman Islands, exclusive of regular coast artillery units, is :   -         1 field  company,  Sappers and Miners.         5-1 British infantry battalions,         2 Indian  infantry battalions.         1 Indian  Territorial  Force infantry  battalion.There  are available also  two  regular  heavy batteries  which  are  at  presentemployed in  manning the coast defences at Bombay and Karachi and  will beavailable  for the same purpose under the new  proposals or to assist in manningcoast defences at other ports should this be thought desirable.  The extra personnelrequired for  manning the  new coast defence batteries proposed  would be found from existing Auxiliary or Territorial Force units.     2.  The troops which it is  proposed to provide for the defence of each of theprincipal ports are detailed below&apos;    (i)  Karachi.           1  British infantry  battalion.           1  Indian  infantry battalion.           (NOTE. The  Indian infantry  battalion  might not  be  immediately,,,.F:;;      -   available on mobilisation as it may be needed  for railway protec--ff:            -tion duties, until  it. can be relieved by  an  Indian  Territorial              infantry battalion.)     (ii) Bombay.                                               .  \           1  British  infantry battalion.           1  Indian infantry battalion.           1  Indian Territorial Force infantry battalion.     (iii) Madras.           1  British  infantry  battalion.           1  Indian infantry battalion.     (iv) Calcutta.           2   British infantry  battalions  (less  one  company  at  Port  Blair,            .  Andaman Islands).     (v)  Cochin.           1  company of British infantry.     (vi)  Vizagapatam.           1- company of British infantry.           (NOTE. The two companies of British infantry which it is proposed to              earmark for Cochin and Vizagapatam would be provided, should               the need arise, from  a battalion allotted to internal  security               duties and  stationed at Wellington in the  Nilgiri Hills.)     In addition to the regular troops enumerated  above,  there are various unitsof the Auxiliary Force (India)  and the Indian  Territorial Force which can share in the task of coast defence.     3.  The regular infantry battalions allotted to coast  defence duties are alsoresponsible -for assisting the Civil  Power in maintaining law and order  in the ports at which they are stationed.
APPENDIX III. ,  Detailed allotment of troops for the preservation in war of Internal Security &apos;  ,&apos;.                     (referred to in paragraph 99). .&apos;;,/..  1.   IT is assumed that any training unit of a combatant arm, comparable in strength  to  a training  battalion,  can be  made  responsible for  dealing  with disturbances, in or within a  few miles of the station  in which it is located, up to a maximum period of three days,  provided the disturbances dot not recur at frequent  intervals.  Should the disturbances be prolonged beyond  three days or recur frequently, reinforcements from elsewhere must be provided if the training unit concerned is to be able to carry,out its proper function, namely, the training of young soldiers to take their place  in active units.  It is  recognised that to attempt to provide in every Military District  in  India internal security, troops on a scale adequate to deal with disturbances that are so  serious ahd concurrent as to resemble armed rebellion is impracticable.  The handling of such a situation must be one of the tasks of the General Reserve.     2.  The problem  of the  preservation of internal security is  divisible  into three parts.  The first, consideration  is  the security of essential strategic  rail communications which may be said to comprise the three railways running from the ports of Karachi, Bombay and Calcutta towards the Western Frontier.   The chief duty, of the troops allotted for the protection of these railways is to ensure the security of vital points, such  as important  bridges and  tunnels, the destruc- tion of which would be likely to interrupt traffic for a considerable.period.   The great length of the railways to  be protected makes it impracticable to afford  full protection against minor damage through sabotage,  such as damage  to  the permanent way, or the destruction of  minor bridges and culverts,  which can be usually overcome in a short time by the construction of diversions. ,    3.  It is considered that  the minimum force necessary to ensure a reasonable measure of protection for these railways is thirteen infantry battalions.  Of these thirteen battalions, two are battalions of Indian States Forces belonging to the States of  Bhopal and Gwalior, whose responsibility it is to safeguard,the railways running, through those  States..  In; this connection it is to be noted  that, for constitutional reasons, it is not possible to employ units of the  Indian States Forces for internal security duties except within the limits of their own States.     4.  When considering railway protection,  there is an important  considera- tion which cannot be overlooked.  Measures for railway security may have to be put into force as soon as an emergency arises, and it follows, therefore, that the troops detailed for this duty must be immediately  available, and must, therefore, belong to the regular Army or to  the Indian States Forces.  At the same time, it is: recognised that the  duties  involved  are such  that they can  be adequately performed by less  highly trained troops.   For this reason the eleven regular infantry battalions, which it  may be necessary  in  the first instance to detail for this  duty, will be replaced by an equivalent number of provincial battalions of the Indian Territorial Force as  soon as these can be made available;  this replace- ment is a necessary feature of the general plan,  as ten  of the regular  Indian infantry battalions, allotted initially  to railway protection  duties, are required later to provide an essential component of the General Reserve, and the remaining battalion  is wanted to undertake coast defence and internal security duties atKarachi.     5.  The second and third  categories of Internal  Security troops are those needed  for the static defence of important centres, political  and military, and to provide mobile reserves for the preservation of law and order in outlying districts.     6.  A special allotment of troops for internal security duties is not necessary in the four Frontier Military  Districts as these have strong permanent garrisons. The  allotment for the remaining Military Districts is given  in detail below :      (i)  Rawalpindi District.           (a)  Vital Points.                 Rawalpindi arsenal and workshops.                 Chaklala workshops.                 Oil storage  tanks and installations.                 Advanced base installations at Rawalpindi.                 The bridge over the Indus at Attock.       [18631]           ^                                         L 2
        (b)  Static Defence Requirements..            1 British infantry battalion.        (c)  Mobile Reserve Requirements.              The District is not large and contains training units situated                  at  Abbottabad   and   Jhelum.  One  Indian   infantry                  battalion is considered adequate as a mobile reserve in this                  District.        (d)  Total Internal Security  Troops  required for the  Rawalpindi              District.              1  British infantry battalion.              1  Indian infantry battalion. (ii) Lahore District.         ;        (a)  Vital Points.              Lahore (Seat of the Punjab Government).              Lahore base  installations.              Aircraft park (Lahore).              Ferozepore Arsenal.              Amritsar (centre of communal strife).              Ambala (Air Force station).              Simla (Summer headquarters of the Government of India).        (b)  Static defence requirements.              Two British infantry battalions                   (one to be located at Lahore and the other at Ambala, with                      detachments at Amritsar and Simla).              One British infantry company- (for Ferozepore).                  (There  are  training  units  at Lahore, Ferozepore  and                      Ambala.)        (c) Mobile reserve requirements.              Training units are located at Sialkot, Jullundur, Dharamsala                  and Bakloh.              The District is large and includes a number of areas, such as                  Gurdaspur, Batala  and Kasur, where communal or  anti-                  government feeling is apt to run high.   Further, there are                  several installations, such as canal headworks and hydro-                  electric plants, which may have  to be given temporary                  protection  in the  event  of local  disaffection.   It is                  considered that one Indian cavalry motor regiment and one                  British infantry battalion  should be provided as a mobile                  District   reserve.   It  is  recommended  also   that  the                  remainder  of the British infantry battalion, of which one                  company is allotted to the static defence  of  Ferozepore,                  should be set  aside  as a mobile reserve with the primary                  task of preserving internal security  in the Multan area.        (d)  Total Internal Security troops required for Lahore District.              One Indian cavalry motor regiment.              Four British infantry  battalions.(iii)  Meerut District and the present  Delhi Independent Brigade Area.        (a)  Vital Points.              Delhi  (seat of the Government of India).        (b) Static defence requirements.              One British infantry battalion.        (c) Mobile reserve requirements.              There are training units at Meerut, Roorkee, Agra, Dehra Dun                  and Bareilly.
              In view of the great extent of the area, and the existence in it                  of potential  centres  of disturbance,  such as Hardwar,                  Moradabad and Lalitpur, and  the importance of main-                  taining  law  and  order in the vicinity  of  Delhi, it is                 -considered necessary to  allot one British battalion and  one                  Indian infantry battalion as a mobile reserve for this area.       (d) Total internal security troops considered necessary for the Meerut              District (including Delhi Independent Brigade Area).              Two British infantry battalions.              One Indian infantry battalion.(iv) Lucknow  District, r       (a) Vital Points.              Lucknow (seat of  the United Provinces Government).              Cawnpore (Ordnance  Depot, saddle and  boot factories and                  civilian   mills  on  which  the  Army  is  dependent  for                  supplies).              Shahjahanpur (Army  clothing factory).              Allahabad (Arsenal).       (b) Static defence requirements.              Two British infantry battalions (one for Lucknow and Cawn-                pore, and the other for Allahabad).       (c) Mobile reserve requirements.              The area included in the Lucknow District is particularly liable                  to  communal  disturbances&quot;  and   strikes.  Further,  the                  Eastern part of  the  area has become  a  serious internal                  security commitment, owing to agrarian disputes.              A mobile reserve of one Indian cavalry motor regiment and  one                  British infantry battalion is considered to be necessary for                  this district.       (d) Total Internal  Security Troops considered necessary for  the              Lucknow District.              One Indian cavalry motor regiment.              Three British infantry battalions. (v) Presidency and  Assam District.       (a) Vital Points.              Calcutta (principal port and seat of  Government).              Metal and Steel Factory            1              Gun and Shell  Factory             fnear Calcutta.              Rifle and  light automatic Factory J              Patna (seat of Bihar Government).              Shillong (seat of  the Assam Government).              Under the head of static defence commitments must be included.                  the  additional &apos;&apos; temporary &apos;&apos;  garrison of three  Indian                  infantry  battalions now  located in Bengal  as an anti-                  terrorist  precaution,  which will  probably  have  to   be                  retained for some time to come if not permanently.            -  The responsibility for static defence  in  the Calcutta area                  devolves on the two British battalions  (less one company                  at Port  Blair) primarily allotted to coast  defence duties.       (b) Static defence requirements.              One  British  infantry battalion  (less two  companies)   at                  Dinapore.              Two Indian infantry battalions       &quot;1 additional garrison              One Indian Territorial Force infantry  V    of geno.al                  battalion                        J            TO              There is a Gurkha training depot at  Shillong.
       (c) Mobile reserve requirements.             Mobile columns which may be required in Eastern Bengal can                 be found from the additional &quot; temporary &quot; garrison.             In  the area north and wes1?of Calcutta, mobile reserve require-                 ments can be met by the  garrison of Calcutta,  which, in                 addition to the two regular British units, contains units                 of the Auxiliary Force (India) and the Indian Territorial                 Force,  and  by  the Indian infantry  battalion of  the                 &apos;&apos; additional&apos;&apos; garrison of Bengal located at Midnapore.                 The  only, area  for which  it  is   considered  necessary                 specifically to provide  a mobile  reserve  is  that round                 Dinapore.   The  remaining two  companies of the British                 infantry battalion stationed at Dinapore can provide for                 this need.       (d) Total  allotment. of Internal Security Troops to Presidency  and\.            Assam  District.   (Exclusive  of  troops  also  allotted to coast             defence duties.)             One British infantry battalion.             Two Indian infantry battalions.             One Indian Territorial Force infantry battalion.(vi) Deccan District.       (a) Vital Points.             The gun carriage factory and other installations at Jubbulpore.             Nagpur (seat of Government of the Central Provinces).             In  addition to the  protection of these vital points,  treaty                 commitments  with Hyderabad  State entail  the location                 in war at Secunderabad of two Indian infantry battalions.                 There is, however, reason to believe that H.E.H. the Nizam                 will  accept  one British infantry battalion  in  place of                 these, and  a British infantry battalion has been allottedK%                accordingly for this purpose.            -       (b) Static  defence requirements.             Two British infantry battalions (one  at Jubbulpore with a                 detachment fn Fort Sitabaldi  at Nagpur;  and one at                 Secunderabad).       (c) Mobile reserve requirements.             With  the exception of Jubbulpore and Nagpur, there are no                 areas in  the Deccan District  which can be  regarded                 normally as potential centres of serious unrest.   Owing to                 the likelihood of a large  reserve ammunition depot being                 located  at  Jubbulpore, and to the possibility of its being                 necessary in emergency to reinforce the  &apos;&apos; static  &apos;&apos; detach-                 ment at Nagpur, it is proposed that, in  war,  a mobile                 reserve of one Indian infantry battalion should be stationed                 at Jubbulpore.       (d) Total allotment of Internal Security Troops to  Deccan  District.             Two British infantry battalions.             One Indian infantry  battalion.(vii) Madras District.       (a) Vital Points.             Cordite Factory at Aruvankadu.             Madras city and port. (A responsibility of the troops allotted                 to coast defence.)       (b) Static defence requirements.             One. British  infantry  battalion  at Wellington  (less  two                 companies)! for the protection of Aruvankadu.
      (c)  Mobile reserve requirements.             The outstanding area of potential disorder in Madras District                 is Malabar.   The Malabar Special Police have reached a                 high standard of efficiency and should be capable of dealing                 with minor  disturbances; there are  also in this area two                 provincial battalions of the Indian Territorial Force which                 it should be possible to make more efficient than they are                 at present.   If disorder became widespread,  any local                 mobile reserve  which could with economy be located  in                 Madras District, would  be insufficient.  The suppression                 of serious disorder in Malabar must therefore be regarded                 as a task for  the General Reserve.  There is, however,                 in the Madras District  a large  and scattered  European                 and Anglo-Indian population, and several towns and areas                 in which  primitive  tribes may be  incited to unrest,  or                 communal conflicts may arise.   It  is  considered that a                 mobile reserve of one  Indian Infantry battalion should be              , .  located at Bangalore, which is a road and rail centre.  It is                 the  intention, however, to defer the withdrawal, which is                 envisaged in the proposals, of the regular Indian infantry                 battalion from  Cannanore until the territorial battalions .;             .  referred to above have reached a state of efficiency which                 will enable them to take over the duty of  the preservationv:         ,       of internal security in Malabar.      (d) Total Internal Security Troops in-Mddras District [excluding the             ports of Madras, Cochin and Vizagapatam).             One British infantry battalion (less two companies).&apos;             One Indian infantry battalion.(viii)  Poona:Independent Brigade Area.      (a) Vital Points.             Poona (Summer  seat of the Government of Bombay and head- ...  i              quarters of  the Southern Command). \ , ...        Kirkee Arsenal.             .  ,      (b) Static defence  requirements.             One British infantry battalion.      (c) Mobile reserve requirements.             Troops might be called upon to aid the civil power at Sholapur,                 in the  Belgaum-Dharwar-Haveri area,  or,  possibly, to  ,i&quot;;,.v     :  ;.     support Detaining Officers at some of the minor ports along                 the coast.   It  is considered,  therefore, that one Indian                 infantry battalion should be located at Poona as a mobile                 reserve for the area.      (d) Total Internal Security  Troops in Poona (Independent) Brigade             A rear           -   -             One British infantry battalion.

(a) Vital Points.          .....  .:           Bombay city and port (a responsibility of the coast defence                 troops).      (b) Static defence requirements.             One Indian infantry battalion (required to be  maintained at                 Baroda under an existing treaty  with the Gaekwar).      (c) Mobile reserve requirements.             Although the  Bombay District is composed largely  of  Indian                 States, it contains the large industrial area of Ahmedabad,                 and a population in  Ajmer which  is susceptible to sub-   i , .           , versive influences, while many of the smaller Indian States

Regimental headquarters.                 Headquarter squadron.                 Three squadrons of three troops of four light tanks each.                  in  the District do not maintain  troops or  police of  a                  strength and an efficiency adequate to deal with disorder                  within their boundaries.  It is proposed that a  mobile                  reserve of one British infantry battalion should be located                  at Mhow, and  that one company of this battalion should                  be detached when required to Ahmedabad.  It is the inten-                  tion to retain the existing garrison bf one regular Indian                  infantry battalion  at  Ahmedabad until the end  of  the                  reorganisation  programme, by which  time  the new road                  linking Ahmedabad with Bombay should be completed or                  nearly so.       (d)  Total Internal Security Troops in Bombay District.             One British infantry battalion.             One Indian infantry  battalion.  (x) Southern Command Reserve.       In view of the great extent of, and  the diverse conditions obtaining             in,  the  area controlled by  the  Southern Command,  and  the             relative scarcity of  the  troops allotted for  the preservation of             internal  security, and their widely separated cantonments, it             is considered that a highly mobile reserve  should be  at  the             disposal  of the  General Officer Commanding-in-Chief.  It is             recommended,  therefore,  that  one  Indian cavalry  motor             regiment should be allotted for this  purpose and stationed             permanently  at  Poona.(xi) Sind Brigade A rea.

Part II. External Defence Troops (reference paragraph 137).    Units allotted to the External Defence Troops will have generally a higherscale of equipment as exemplified below        Field A artillery Regiment  may have two batteries of. 12 guns each giving    a total of 24 guns as against 16 in the Indian organisation.        Infantry battalions, both British  and Indian, will probably each have    10 armoured tracked carriers instead of wheeled trucks in the carrier platoon    of the Headquarter company.   They will also have 50 light machine guns    instead of 45, two  3-inch mortars  and  12 2-inch mortars  instead of  the    four 2-inch mortars provided for the Local Defence Troops.  They will have    22 anti-tank&apos; rifles instead of  the 6 provided for the Local Defence Troops.    The total number of motor vehicles is increased from 48 to 65 in these units.    There are  other minor differences,  but the above should suffice to show the    higher scale on which External Defence Troops will be equipped.APPENDIX  V.    DETAILED SUGGESTIONS MADE BY THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIES IN THE                         MODERNISATION PROPOSALS.                         (Reference paragraph 126.)    1.  THE following points of detail regarding the proposed organisation andequipment of the types of modernised units in the Army in India are put forward for further consideration by the defence authorities in India in the course of their detailed review of the reorganisation proposals :     (i) Cavalry motor regiment :  one S.A.A.  lorry might be reduced of the two           provided in the unit headquarters.    (ii) Cavalry4 motor regiment: two (instead of four) light machine guns might           be provided for anti-aircraft duties.
  -(iii) Royal Artillery :  in the establishment of field and.medium regiments it           appears that  an unnecessarily large number of spare  drivers  is           provided.   (iv) Signals units :  the number of cable laying wagons might be susceptible           of reduction.    (v) Field Ambulances (motor cavalry  brigade) :  five of the  fifteen  motor           ambulances provided in this establishment might be reduced.   (vi) Anti-tank Rifles : the  necessity for the provision of these weapons  in           certain ancillary  units, such as engineer field companies,  might  be           reconsidered.    2.  Certain suggestions, which we have not attempted to examine critically,were made to us in evidence, and should,  we consider, be borne in mind  in  thecourse of  the review of the reorganisation proposals referred to in the previous paragraph.   They are listed below :     (i) Royal  Indian  Army  Service  Corps:  the  proposed  increase  of  the           specialist personnel of this corps,  and also the need for the grant to           its officers of Specialist Pay in addition to Regimental and Corps Pay,           might be reconsidered.    (ii) The  possibility of dispensing with the Headquarters of the  Allahabad           Brigade Area, and of reducing the  Madras District to the status of           an Independent Brigade Area, might receive further consideration.   (iii) The  proposed addition of one  officer  to  the  establishment  of Indian           cavalry and infantry  units retained after the reduction  of Indian           units contemplated in our proposals might be reconsidered.    3.  Our  survey   of  the  schedule  of measures  of  capital expenditure(Appendix  VI) required by the  modernisation proposals  has  suggested  possi-bilities of economies in certain directions, and we append a list of these, togetherwith the estimated cost of each item :-     (i) Garages required by the cavalry, artillery and infantry  modernisation           /proposals  (Rs. 195  lakhs).                It was represented  to us  in evidence  that  a high standard of           garage  accommodation,   e.g.,  all  steel roofs,  concrete floors, was           necessary  in Indian  conditions.  We  think  that the possibility of           making some reduction in this item should be borne in mind when the           detailed plans are drawn up for erecting these garages.    (ii) Modernisation of Sappers and Miners  (Rs. 45 lakhs).                The equipment proposed for field  park companies includes road           graders,  costing  Rs.  2 lakhs  a set.   The need for this expensive           equipment should be further examined.   (iii) Trolleys for railway security units (Rs. 2 lakhs).                The reason advanced for this  is  the need  for  making railway           protection troops more mobile.  The service does not appear to us to           be of a high priority.    (iv) Extra hiring  costs during modernisation (Rs. 6 lakhs).                This provides  for the hiring of transport after certain existing           motor transport units are abolished  and before they are fully replaced           by the transport available from mechanised units.  If the  fullest  use           is made of existing  resources,  including subsidised transport, some           reduction in this item may prove possible.     (v) Provost units, modernisation (Rs. 2 lakhs).                The main expenditure is  on motor cycles for these units.  The            purchase  might be deferred until the need arises.    (vi) Increase in store margins (Rs. 76  lakhs).                It is proposed to increase the reserves  of stores held at ordnance            depots  to meet  contingencies  such as  Frontier emergencies, local            disturbances,  interruptions of communications, &amp;c.  We realise  that            such contingencies may  on  occasion throw a heavy strain on local
         reserves of stores, but we consider that a reduction ought to be possible         under this head without grave detriment to efficiency, thus effecting         an appreciable saving. (vii) Garages for reserve vehicles (Rs. 25 lakhs).             We think that some saving may be possible in this item when the         detailed reconnaissance of  sites, &amp;c, has been carried  out  and the         possibility of adapting or converting existing accommodation to find         room for vehicles held in reserve has been more fully explored.(viii) Accommodation general (Rs.  100 lakhs).             Certain of  the major building services  included here are for the         erection or completion of barracks  at stations on the North-West         Frontier, viz., Thai, Wana and Bannu. It is possible that in certain         cases the review of Frontier policy which we recommend in Chapter 3,         Section 1, of our Report  may &quot;affect the building programme, and  we         think this possibility should be borne in mind in proceeding with the         works services under this item.APPENDIX VI.SCHEDULE OF  MEASURES INVOLVING CAPITAL  EXPENDITURE  AND SAVINGS  IN THE                      ARMY MODERNISATION PROPOSALS.(A) Schedule of items of capital expenditure under the modernisation proposals                         (reference paragraph 126).1,-Measures directly due to modernisation of units, &amp;c.1.Cavalry reorganisation AccommodationGaragesVehiclesTransportationInfantry reorganisation-AccommodationVehiclesGaragesTransportationArtillery reorganisation-AccommodationGaragesVehiclesTransportation 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.Weapons and ammunitionModernisation of SignalsModernisation of Sappers and MinersModernisation of Schools of InstructionLand for Field Firing rangesGeneral training equipmentTraining equipment for training unitsRoyal Indian Army Service Corps (Transportation, &amp;c.Veterinary services (Transportation, &amp;c.)Provost units (provision  of motor cycles, &amp;c.)  ...Vehicles for  School of Mechanisation   ...Mechanical Transport for Medical units ...Armoured Cars for Auxiliary Force (India) units  9-55 1 51-60  L430-22  4-63 99-45^1246-36  L118-90  f 18-08 J39-8024-7093-92 1-45Lakhs, of rupees. 496-00482-79159-87887-10 41 13 44-59  7-50  2-70 11-84  1-  2-30008400851052

A table is appended  showing the availability for war  of units allotted tothe  local defence of India during the process of modernisation.  It should be read in conjunction with the following notes :- Notes.     (i)  The symbol &quot; Z &quot;  represents &quot; Zero Day,&quot; which is taken to be the dayon which the order to commence modernisation  is given.     (ii)  The numbers shown against each heading  represent the units of that particular class or type which will be available to take the field at that particularstage of  modernisation.     (iii) This  table does not include the units of the  External Defence Troops,but  has  been compiled on the assumption that priority will be accorded to the modernisation  of these  troops and that this will be completed in the first twoyears, that is by Z  -f 24 months.     (iv)  It has been assumed in the table that the British cavalry regiment andthe two  British infantry battalions, which it is understood the War Office may desire to withdraw  altogether from  India,  will  be removed from the IndianEstablishment. in the course of the first 12 months.   * This is necessarily a very conjectural estimate of the ,value of the lands and buildings-which will be rendered surplus under the proposals.   f These savings are expected to accrue from the using-up of surplus stocks to meet currentrequirements.

APPENDIX VIII.    SOURCES  OF SUPPLY  AND MAINTENANCE OF  MODERNISATION  EQUIPMENT.                         (Reference paragraph 232.)    THE following table shows the sources  of initial supply  and subsequentmaintenance  of  the  principal items of equipment, ammunition, &amp;c, required under the modernisation proposals, and on which the plans for the expansion ofthe Indian Ordnance Factories are based.    In this table the equipment is divided into four categories : A.B.C.D.The full requirements will be manufactured and maintained by India.The bulk of the initial requirements will be obtained from England, but  subsequent maintenance will be by manufacture in India.The bulk  of the initial requirements and  part of the maintenance  requirements will be obtained  from England, a limited part only of  the maintenance requirements being produced in India.The initial and maintenance requirements will both be  obtained from  England.
