                   APPENDIX                     No. 1.TELEGRAM FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM HIGH COMMISSIONER IN CANADA                RECEIVED 25TH MARCH, 1959.No.  80.      1.    In discussing  the international situation generally the  Prime  Minister used  language to me which suggested thathe was becoming apprehensive lest Canada was going to he invited to join some sort of military alliance between theUnited Kingdom and other European Countries.   This -he saidwould cause grave embarrassment and in particular he expressed  regret that it should apparently have become .necessary  for the United Kingdom to associate herself with theU.S.S.R.   From the Canadian point of view particularlythat of French Canadians and other Roman Catholic communitiesthat association would still be regarded as very unfortunate.     2.    Generally the  people of Canada would not be broughtinto any war which would appear to have been due solely toa Balkan dispute or a dispute between what he termed&quot;African countries&quot; (e.g. between France and Italy overNorth African territories).     3.    It is abundantly evident from the Prime Minister&apos;general attitude and his extreme reluctance even underconsiderable pressure,  to make any clear statement ofCanada&apos;s position that he hopes to be able to maintainuntil the  last possible moment a position of detachment from europe and indeed the rest of the Empire and that he isif anything less disposed to co-operate with other countriesin the defence of democracy than are the Government of the                                                   United
United States.   when considering any form of co-operationMackenzie King appears to have in mind that the emergencywould only be as a result of direct attack upon the UnitedKingdom or possibly upon iTance, Low Countries or Switzerland.He entirely failed to take into account that it is inthe present circumstances impossible for the United kingdom to remain disinterested in what happens elsewhere inEurope and that continuous aggressive action in Central orEastern europe might eventually succeed in invalidatingthe situation as a result of which the aggressor might comeinto collision with the Western Democracies with enhancedprospects of success from the military point of view.   Itmight I suggest therefore be useful to lay emphasis on this aspect of the situation for educative purposes as occasion offers.
KJ 1No.     Telegram from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Canada. .                       Received 27th April, 1959.No. 1L.8.  Secret.          Your telegram Circular Z No. 7 of April 25th. xUpon receipt of your telegram it occurred to me that  the bestearly  opportunity of public statement on lines indicated might occur  in defended speech on introducing Defence Estimates whichMinister of National Defence was to make en April 26th for which.suitable publicity could be arranged.  I therefore decided ts seePrime  Minister  on evening of April 25th in order to discuss withhim informally possibility of a statement  on these lines being included in speech.          I regret to have to state  that Prime Minister&apos;s reaction to this suggestion was definitely unfavourable.   He  said that he himself was going away for a rest of  ten days  or so almost immediately, and made it clear  that  in any case he&apos; could net haveconsented to a  statement being  made  approving  the present policyof the United Kingdom Government in  building up anti-aggressionbloc in Europe  nor could he conscientiously make one  himself.  Herepeated what he had already said in the debate in the House ofCommons on March 20th to the effect  that if the United Kingdom wereherself wantonly attacked he felt no doubt as to what Canaddsattitude would be.  But he went on,  very much  on lines indicatedin my  telegram  of March 20th No.80T  to say that there was considerable apposition in Canada to the manner in which the                                                        Unite dX  This telegram suggested that, in view of German anti-british propaganda, Dominion Prime Ministers&apos; might be prepared to makestatements expressing general support  of the policy  of the UnitedKingdom Government.                 \+  No. 1.                             \
                                                              u d United Kingdom appears to be &quot;becoming entangled with Balkanand Eastern European countries and above all with Russia.   Therewere many people in Canada including some Ministers, and Igathered that this included him, who disliked entanglements ofthis kind.   He could not forecast in advance of Parliament what line Canada would take if the United Kingdom went to the help ofone of these countries and as a result were herself attacked.That would be an issue upon which the country must remain free todecide through parliament in any case in his view to make astatement at this stage which would have&apos; the effect of associatingCanada with United Kingdom, policy of guaranteeing Eastern and SouthEastern European States against aggression would give rise to a debate in which opinions would be -expressed which would affordreal ammunition to German propagandists.  It would also split thecountry and he reiterated what he has often said before that his efforts must be directed to securing se far as possible that thereshould be unity of feeling within Canada at the moment when adecision might have to be taken on the subject &amp;F participation in a conflict.          I naturally aid what  I could to remove the PrimeMinister&apos;s suspicions of the guarantees which are being given aspart of the present United Kingdom policy aiming to preserve peace and to stress the point that they were essential factors in building up resistance to aggression but I am afraid that I failedto shake him and he evidently has a temperamental and rooteddislike of becoming associated by means of any public statement in any European system of guarantee or alliances and particularly where Russia is concerned.
       Aide Memoire oommunico.ted by the High Commissioner               for the Union of South Africa.               &quot;       &quot;22nd April&quot; 1959.          The following are the views held by the Union Cabinet,after receiving Circular Telegram B.  162 of the 18th April,*which the High Commissioner has been requested by General Kertzogto submit immediately to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom.   .1.    What the implications of the proposals as conveyed inCircular B. 162 of April 18th5-- from the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs - if accepted - may be, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom will know much better than we do here.   Wehowever share their dislike of paragraphs (e) and (f).  (N.B.  Thisparagraph is apparently the result of  the High Commissionersreport of the dislike of paragraphs (e) and (f) of the Russianproposals held by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom as communicated to the High Commissioners at their meeting with sir Thomas Inskip and Mr. Butler  on the 19th April).    2.    We consider bi-lateral  obligation with Russia should if possible be avoided as well as any  engagements which maycommit  Great Britain irrevocably to Russia and are  thuscalculated to cause maximum friction with Dictator States.    3.,    We attach great importance to Roosevelt&apos;s  suggestions for future economic and other peaceful negotiations  and alsoto possibility that Hitler and Mussolini may in reply maketerritorial, colonial and economic counter-proposals which should                                                             in*   This telegram summarized the  original proposals  of the    Soviet Government
in fairness &quot;be considered,    4.  We suggest therefore that no obligations should be entered into with Russia which may hereafter preclude suchconsideration and negotiation in the interests of future peace    5.  It is also important to bear in mind that strength ofBritish case lies in its appeal to the public opinion of the world,including the United States, and this is an additional reason for avoiding obligations which may afterwards render settlement by negotiation difficult or impossible or which may appear to theworld to be aimed primarily at maintaining status quo and cutting off Germany from reasonable economic expansion eastwards,    6,  I am further to inform His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom that from information received from Dr. Gie inBerlin, it would appear that on April 18th Hitler was stillhanging back from irrevocable action and that it appeared difficult for him to make up his mind, and that in his (Dr. Gie&apos;s) viewpotentially perhaps the gravest danger in the situation is an anglo-Soviet pact, the conclusion of which might bring Hitler to overcome his last, scruples against taking a step which will leadto war.

Aide Memoire of a Message from General Hertzog to be delivered to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom in elaboration of his views handed to Sir Thomas Inskip bythe High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa on22nd April. 1959.          In a reply to information cabled after the HighCommissioner&apos;s meeting with Sir Thomas Inskip on Wednesdayevening (the 17th May), General Hertzog desires to refer theUnited Kingdom Government again to his Cabinet&apos;s views as expressed in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the Aide Memoire of the&apos;          x22nd April, and more especially to the latter portion ofparagraph 5.          He and his colleagues feel strongly that the adoptionof the Russian proposals, with which the United KingdomGovernment may be faced as an alternative to their own, willclose the door to peace and make war almost inevitable, as suchan alliance with Soviet Russia is sure to be taken by germany as an attempt to cut her off from economic expansion Eastwards,and so to reduce her to a state of the greatest possibleweakness in any future struggle with her declared enemy.          The persistence with which Germany resents any action by Western Europe calculated to interfere with the extension ofher interest towards the East cannot be overlooked in thequestion now under consideration.                       -  (Sgd.)

No. 5.&apos; Telegram from the Governor General  for  New Zealand Received ,12th May,  1959. No.52.   Secret.          Negotiations  with Russia.    Following  from my Prime Minister begins.          His Majesty&apos;s Government in  New  Zealand warmly appreciate  detailed and helpful  information with which they are being supplied by you.   They  fully realise that His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in the  United  Kingdom  are much nearer  to the problem,  and more  intimately affected by possible results,  than are His Majesty&apos;s  Government in New  Zealand but  they would regard it  as deplorable if Russian assistance  in  the prevention  of aggression were not secured and in their view no  reasonable opportunity should be lost of  obtaining Russian  collaboration in this essential policy.      Ends.
6 dMSNZIES.Telegram from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth ofAustralia to the High Commissioner.  Received 22nd. May, 1939,No.55.         POP BRUCE.   MOOT SECRET AND PERSONAL.Please advise His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom that Australian Government has now further considered questions which arise in relation to a Britishagreement with U.8.S.R.   While we attach great importanceto preserving friendship with Japan and would therefore beunhappy about any Russian agreement which applied to far east we agree that opportunity should not be lost to make effective agreement between Great Britain and U.S.S.R. whichwould reinforce anti-aggression pact with Poland and whichwould strengthen in particular Turkey and Roumania.   short of a positive demand to expand agreement to Par East wethink Russian negotiations should not be allowed to fail.
