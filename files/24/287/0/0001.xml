CONTROL  OF EXPENDITURE.               Memorandum, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    THE continuous flow of demands which reach the Treasury from all quarters for approval to schemes involving heavy expenditure, compels  me to draw  theattention  of the Cabinet to the serious situation with which we are threatenedand to ask them to help to provide a remedy for it.   Success hitherto in findingall the money required gives no assurance for the future, in view of the tremendousacceleration in expenditure; moreover, our past success is itself largely an illusion,for we have been losing gold heavily and it is the payments received for that goldwhich have kept the Exchequer in funds.  We appear  to be, going oh as com-fortably as if we were paying our way :  we are really reducing our resources ata rapid rate and getting  closer to  the position where the results  of  this willbecome  evident and alarming.    2;  So  recently as the 20th  February I  announced  that  the  government borrowing programme for  the year would be  350 millions. I  had been advised that, though a very great effort would be required to find the money, it ought notto be impracticable in the  special circumstances of  1939-40 which  enable us toincrease our sales of Treasury Bills.  I was warned that very different conditions would prevail next year and  that without  a great  rise in the national income and in  taxation a repetition of the  programme might well prove impossible.    3.  As a result of  the decision to double the  Territorial  Army and adoptother Defence schemes I raised the borrowing programme in my Budget  speechby  30  millions, in addition to providing  20 millions more by new  taxes.  Con-scription  will raise the total to be borrowed by probably another  25 millions.These are, of course, only  the additions  for the current year;  the whole cost ofthe schemes was vastly greater.   Meanwhile, I constantly receive new schemesinvolving heavy expenditure for defence proper, for buying stocks of essential commodities, for agriculture, for shipping, and for granting&apos; financial assistanceto foreign and Empire countries.   Many of the  schemes,  I do not doubt,  areadmirable if we  could afford  them,  and could properly find a  place in generaldefence preparations :  but it  would be,  I submit, the greatest  misfortune werethe Cabinet to continue to  consider these matters as  the individual schemes comealong on the basis mainly  of their individual merits in contributing to national security.    4.  We must face hard facts.  We  cannot finance ourselves by inflationarymethods which,  if they gave relief  for a  certain  period to an  embarrassedExchequer, would be followed with  certainty by a collapse in the purchasing-power Of  our currency, so that the loans we could raise would represent little inbuying  power.   We cannot continue to lose gold in great quantities indefinitelyor we shall find ourselves  in a position when we should  be unable  to wage  any;war other than a brief one.  There  is a limit to the rate at which we  can raise       [19289]
money, and that limit, to the best of my judgment, is already reached.   We cango  on for another six or nine  months if there are no further additions oraccelerations, but thereafter, unless something unexpectedly favourable  happens,it may well be that the present rate could not be maintained.    5.  I feel bound, therefore, to ask my colleagues to give their most seriousattention  to the situation  as  I have described  it,  and to regard themselves asequally responsible with me for  seeing that we do not allow ourselves to  driftinto increased financial peril.  When we were in the early stages of our defence programmes, the  Treasury were as keen as anybody in reaching decisions  as towhat  should be done, and they readily^ acquiesced in extremely heavy commitments.I do not wish in any way to slow up our programmes,  but, for the reasons given above, it is clear that from now onwards we must be much more conservative inour expenditure.   National safety must, of course, still  dominate all other con-siderations, but  our Defence schemes are well advanced and  it is  possible,therefore, now to take other factors into consideration to  a degree that has notbeen feasible hitherto.   Even in regard to defence proposals it should be possibleto settle some order of priority. It is a question of deciding whether it is essentialto expand particular activities and whether in  consequence we shall have to goslower in  developing other  activities.    6.  It was recognised, when the rearmament programme began, that a policyof  increasing  expenditure,   undertaken  for  the purpose  of making   thiscountry  stronger  in   the minimum  of  time,  was  bound   to  weaken  orsuspend   some  of  the   controls   which  usually  operate.    The   Treasuryobjection,  for  example,  to  large   increases  in   Estimates  as   comparedwith   the  previous  year had  little weight  when  the Government   andthe country were  deliberately  engaged in  the  policy  of spending   a greatdeal more in the interests of national safety.  But, in order to provide a safeguard,soon  after the five-year programme  costing  1,500 millions was adopted, theCabinet discussed and deliberately adopted a plan of rationing, and the  presentDomiiiions Secretary exerted himself to distribute maximum figures between theDefence Departments as a  limit to be observed year by  year.  It is not surprising that with the transformation of our conceptions as regards the Army, and therepeated revision in an upward direction of our aircraft programme, the presentexpenditure of neither the War Office nor the Air Ministry bears any relation tothe suggested ration.  The Naval programme has suffered no such complete trans-formation and  the expenditure of  the  Admiralty,  though  very  large  and increasing, has not expanded at the same rate.   What I wish the Cabinet torealise is that the restraint upon Defence expenditure which we devised andsought to apply some time back is no longer effective over the whole field,  and whatis therefore needed is some substituted method for surveying new proposals inthe light of the general financial situation.    7.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer has, of course, his special responsibility in these matters, and the business of saying &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; for the  Treasuryis peculiarly and finally his.   Nor can  he escape this responsibility.  In presentcircumstances, however, he is  entitled  to something more than the considerationof his financial difficulties by the particular colleague who wishes to spend furthermoney.   Wider advice on  the more  general problem, having  regard  to the sumtotal  of  financial demands;  would be very valuable,  for  the essence of theChancellor of the Exchequers problem is the relation of a particular piece of proposed  expenditure to the whole financial conspectus.   Accordingly,  I  suggestthat three or  four members of the Cabinet should be nominated who  would beavailable, at my request, for the purpose of examining with me, more particularly from  the expenditure :point of view,  fresh proposals that may come forwardinvolving substantial outlay which  appear to require such examination.   Theobject of  the examination would  be to deal with the matter in broad outline andwould not dispense with the need for the present methods of detailed control  whenthe&apos; general authority has  been given  by the  Treasury.   I  use  the  word&quot; expenditure &quot; in its widest sense as covering expenditure out of Votes, or outof Government borrowings, or capital expenditure by other authorities or personsinduced by Government subsidies or grants.
