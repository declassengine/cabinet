I. THE WAR CHEST.-    THE recent development of events particularly the growth of the defence programme and  the persistent  demand for loans  and  credits  from  foreigncountries has added to the problem of finding money for  defence a new anxietyas to  our  ability  to  defend the   and to continue  to purchase vital necessitiesfrom  abroad, both in present conditions if they continue, and, above all, in war.    2.  Ordinarily imports are paid for by  exports  or else by gold or the saleof foreign assets.  When the balance of trade  is  adverse as  it is now, bothincreased  foreign  purchases  for defence and equally loans to  foreign countriesinvolve within a brief sp&quot;ace a loss of gold.    3.  The present  policy is increasing the pressure on  the exchange in threeways.    Armaments made at home for ourselves involve the  import of raw materials from  abroad equal probably on average to 25 per cent, to 30 per  cent, of the valueof the orders, and in  these times possibly more.    Armaments purchased from abroad absorb gold.    Loans and credits to foreign countries, if expended on the purchase of goodsin this country, involve imports on the average of 25  per cent, to 30  per cent, ormore  of the money so expended;   if taken abroad,  in the long run they add in whole to our gold losses.    4.  Fifteen months ago our  gold stock was  over  800 million.   It  lookedimposing, but, in  fact, gave a rather misleading appearance of strength.   It hadbeen accumulated in some considerable measure owing to the transfer to london of fugitive short money.   In less  than 15 months  of international tension nearly40 per cent, of our gold stock has disappeared.    5.  The reasons  for our gold loss of over  300 million in 15 months (only part of the figures published) are  as follows :     6.  The economic set-back in 1937 profoundly disturbed world conditions,the effect being especially marked among the best  customers of our export trade.    7.  A great deal of fugitive  French  money has returned to France;  to that extent our loss is France&apos;s gain.    8.  The balance of  our trade  is adverse,  but  the  essential point  for sterlingis the aggregate balance of trade of the sterling bloc which banks in London.  It
is estimated that for a period of 18 months to December last the sterling balancesheld in London by countries of the sterling bloc were falling at the rate of some 80 million a year.;    9.  These economic factors leading to a  depletion of our gold stocks havebeen reinforced  by  the effect of political conditions.  A great deal of  fugitivemoney in London has been transferred by foreigners to the United States or othersupposedly safe  countries, and probably there is a small trickle of British invest-ments  to the United States, though the amount  is not significant.    10.  War preparations have played a part and will play a much greater partin determining the fate of our gold reserves :-    Diversion of activities from  peaceful enterprise to  war preparation leads to a decline in exports, and the intensification of the defence  plans leads to anincrease in imports, especially of  raw materials,  but in some cases also ofcompleted goods from  the United  States.   War  preparation has come to includethe giving of loans or grants to foreign countries on a large scale.    11.  The limit of commercial export credits has recently been increased from 50 millions to  75 millions, and the amount of the credits actually granted hasincreased very greatly in recent months.   Sound short-term commercial creditscertainly resulting in repayment in not more than two or three years  are  not sovery harmful, but medium and long-term credits are harmful,  particularly ifrepayment  is uncertain.    Included in  these credits are  10 millions for Russia, more than half of whichis unspent, and   10 millions for Turkey, of which  2 millions is already beingspent.    12.  It is unfortunate that at a  time when we shall clearly have to cut downcapital expenditure in this country needed  to maintain the standard of living weshould have committed ourselves to finance capital expenditure for the develop-ment and industrialisation of other  countries.    13.  Apart  from &quot;these commercial credits, there is a further   6 millions for turkey,  4 millions net for Czecho-Slovakia,   5 millions for China, a probable 30 millions for India (Army re-equipment).    14.  Existing commitments in  respect of   &quot;political  export credits&quot; to various countries amount to  19  millions, plus interest, and  suggestions from government Departments for new  promises under this head to  cover the cases ofPoland, New Zealand, Turkey, Roumania,  &amp;c, and to give a margin for furtherapplications, bring the total to  60 millions, plus interest, which will appear ina Bill  about to be introduced.    15.  The Polish Government,  in fact,  asked for  60 millions; New Zealandis in difficulties  and needs new money both for  defence and for other purposes;Roumania and Turkey are both asking for more.    16.  The following measures have been taken to  protect the exchange.   Thevalue of sterling has been let  down from 5 dollars  to 4-68.   The  embargo onforeign issues has been greatly tightened up.   A very large  bloc of gold has beentransferred from the Bank of England  to the  Exchange Equalisation account for use in active defence.  Sweeping measures to discourage and impede specula-tion have been taken.               .    17.  Very little more could be done even with the most far-reaching powers.A further small depreciation of the    would be ineffective;  a large depreciation,even if it were on balance desirable, is not at present practical politics.    18.  Up to  the  present the disadvantage of our gold loss has been largelypolitical.  It must discourage our friends and  encourage the Axis Powers.    If it continues swiftly it will soon become also  a serious  economic anxietyeven in peace. But the greatest anxiety is that it may gravely  affect our stayingpower  in war. Our gold stock, together with such assets as we may be able to sellor mortgage in wartime to countries overseas, constitutes our sole war chest.    19.  The amount of our requirements of foreign exchange in a war of long-duration defies calculation.  We shall require food and raw materials and maybearmaments  in great quantities.   What exports we  can  sell,  and to whom, to
$ ^ ^O &amp; tioffset the imports, is uncertain.  It is uncertain, too, to what extent our allies will be financially dependent on us (though it is prima facie unlikely that russia would require financing in a new war to the extent that she did in the Great War).     20.  The only prudent conclusion is that we ought to preserve: the largestwar chest  possible.   To-day that chest contains some  200  million of foreign securities which  we could hope to sell or mortgage,  and  500 million of goldrapidly diminishing.     21.  The contrast between this and our  war-chest at the beginning of theGreat War is as follows.     22.  On the one hand our gold stock is for the present much in excess of thatin 1914.     23.  On the other hand, in 1914 by stopping foreign lending we could, other things being equal,  improve our buying power by  some  200  millions a year.To-day there is no foreign lending and our revenue account is  50 million a yearto the bad.     24.  In 1914 we recalled some  50 million short money invested abroad to-day much short money invested in London can be withdrawn from us.     25.  In the Great War we requisitioned and sold abroad some  200 million of  foreign  securities apart from private sales  abroad which were  probablyconsiderable.  To-day we can  by requisitioning obtain  200 million of foreign securities and hope to sell these, but no more.,     26.  In the Great War we did not need to attempt to sell blocks of sterlingsecurities.   In the next war, though we could try to do so, the possibility of successon more than a very  small scale is exceedingly doubtful.     27.  As regards foreign borrowing in war, the contrast with our position inthe Great War is as follows :      28.  In the  Great War we  borrowed  250 million  from private  investorsabroad (mostly U.S.A.) all of which was repaid and we borrowed  840 million from the United States Government (not repaid).   To-day under the Johnson Actwe cannot borrow in the United States either privately or from  the Government.     29.  Nevertheless, unless,  when the time comes the United States  are pre-pared either to lend  or to give us money as required,  the prospects for a long war are becoming exceedingly grim.     30.  It has already  been pointed out that it is impossible to frame  estimates of the rate at which our resources in gold and foreign securities might be drawn on in the event of war.   At the rate,  20 million a month, at which we have beenusing gold,  our  reserves would barely last three  years and  considering theincreased demands likely in war, this  estimate of the  period is very likely much too optimistic.                          II. MONEY FOR DEFENCE.     31.  The Cabinet review  of February,  1938, allotted for defence  in 1939,1940 and 1941, roughly  1,000 million.     This had grown by September 1938 to roughly  1,100 million.     Subsequent additions, for most but not all of  which rough estimates havebeen given by the Defence Departments, may be put broadly at  1,000 million.     Present rough total for three years,  2,100 million.     32.  A division between years may be guessed as follows :       &apos;    J           .i   ,  i   *                ,  ,        ,   million.     , ( ,- &quot;    &quot;  r -1939&apos;-  &apos;  ..:     ...   &apos;      .         ...    ...  i 1 750-/,            &apos;i94o .    ::y... - t&quot;..i.          700   - -,  ,   ... , ^    .  1941     ...  ri  ...  .   ......     ..;    ...    650, &apos;     [The figure now estimated to be required in 1939 exceeds by   120 million thefigure mentioned, in-the.Budget speech in April.] -       [1954:71                                                    B  2 &apos;
    33.  On the basis of existing taxation, allowing on an optimistic basis forestimated increases of yield and  some favourable factors affecting  the  capital account,  the balance  of  expenditure to be found somehow  may be guessed asfollows : )             1939&apos;-...    ...     ...     ...    ...      500 million or a little less             1940   ...    ...     ...           ...      360million   :         .    1941  .......   ....    ....  ...    ....      330 million or rather less    34.  In 1939, but not in subsequent years,  150 million or thereabouts can beborrowed on Treasury Bills, leaving, say,  350 million to be borrowed on  long ormiddle term.    35.  The foregoing figures are far beyond anything that can be borrowed byordinary means without inflation.    36.  One remedy lies in increased taxation.  The Cabinet note of April laston the growth of Civil Expenditure showed that between 1925 and 1938 the  yield of increases in  taxation  amounting  to   245 million enabled us  to provide 153  million more for defence.  In 1939  24  million new taxes were added, butthe additional amount for defence was lowered to   125 milllion.    Additional taxation, totalling on a full-year basis some  280 million, has been secured by-1-         Increasing income tax and supertax by  roughly 40 per cent.         Increasing tobacco duty  by  40 per cent.         Increasing estate duties  by  roughly  20 per cent.         New oil duty at 9d. a gallon.         New tariff duties.         Many minor  changes, including,  e.g., 25 per  cent,  increase on  private             motor duties and much heavier  increases of duties on commercial             vehicles.    37.  There  must  be some limit to new increases of taxation in peace if anyelasticity is to be left  over for war, when  the yield of  many customs and excise duties will cease or greatly fall and collection of direct taxes may in the initial stages be greatly delayed.    38.  Suppose by  way of illustration that in the Budget of 1940 taxation  is increased by  100 million (e.g., by a Budget of  new  taxes similar to the lastBudget, plus Is. extra on the income tax).    The requisite borrowing would then be          1939 :  500  million,  of which  150 million would be by Treasury Bills                   and  350 million on long  or middle term.         1940 :  260  million.         1941 :  230  million or rather less.    39.  These  figures, which take no  account  of concurrent requirements ofmoney for loans  to foreign countries (and equally take no account of dominion and municipal borrowings),  axe up to,  if not beyond and in  the  case of thecurrent year are certainly beyond the limit of  what can be  borrowed out of savings by ordinary means.    40.  In the  course of time, therefore, and may be a short time, it is  likelyto be necessary  to contemplate a  variety of controls,  especially          Prohibition  of new issues.         Control of advances by Banks.         Control of advances by Building Societies.         Control of Companies&apos; dividends and investment of their  reserves.         Possibly also control of prices.    These matters are accordingly being studied at the present time.    41.  It has  so far been assumed that the programme would end in  April1942.  There  must at best be an overlap.  Even when the normal cost of main-tenance is reached,  it  is likely to require (including the service of the new debt)some   450 million per annum, a figure unattainable on anything resembling thepresent scale of taxation.
                             III. CONCLUSIONS.    42.  Apart from increased taxation,  the following means of arresting thegeneral deterioration suggest themselves :     43.  The primary  need is to  conserve  our resources  in  gold and  foreign exchange, which, represent staying  power in war.    44.  Inflation, with the gold losses it would involve (apart from its  otherevils), must be avoided.. Very heavy increases of taxation are in prospect, and inthe course of time general controls are likely to become necessary and the standardof living must be directly or indirectly affected.    45.  Purchases abroad of armaments must  be avoided to the greatest extent possible.  Further  expenditure on  armaments in  this   country cannot  beundertaken without counting the cost  in gold.   Indeed, as there  is a prospect ofthe continuance of the present armed peace, if not of the outbreak of war, finalityof expenditure (unless for  overmastering reasons) should now be  declared.    46.  If  nevertheless  substantial  new expenditures  are contemplated, theCabinet should be provided not only with estimates of cost,  but so far as  possible with estimates  of the extra strain involved upon the exchanges.    47.  In any lengthy war there are types of food and of vital raw materials,the acquisition of  which from  overseas is essential to our continued existence.It is for consideration  whether, bearing ih mind the possible lack of means offoreign payment in war, the enhanced prices and  the difficulty of carriage inwar and  the possible losses  at sea,  the process  of acquiring  stores   of suchessentials (now standing in the case of a variety of special minerals, &amp;e.,  requiredfor war at about six months&apos; war requirements), where they are durable and capable of safe storage, should  not be carried further in spite of the immediategold losses which  that course involves.    48.  Loans to foreign countries,  specially loans not to be expended in thiscountry, must be restricted to the lowest possible limits.   The point to  be  borne in mind here is that every new commitment of this character definitely reduces the period for which we shall be able  to finance war.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,      July 3, 1939.
