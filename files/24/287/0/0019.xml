                 BOARD OF TRADE ,,DVIS0RY COUNCIL.                      State  of Trade - April 1959. Summary  of  Reports  submitted by Members of the Board of Trade Advisory  Council (supplemented in some cases with      statistical information from other sources).     OVgRSLA  TRADE.   Imports in April  ( 70.1 million)  showed a decline  of   3.5 million  as  compared with April 1938.   Imports of  raw materials and  articles mainly unmanufactured were  2.0 million  less,  and imports of food, drink and  tobacco  1.8 million  less.  Lxports of United  Kingdom products( 35.1 million)  were  2.1 million  less  than in April 1938.     RAILWAY  TRAFFIC. In  the five weeks ended 30th ^pril  1939, railway  traffic receipts increased by   466,000,  or 3.1 per cent, as compared with the  corresponding period  of 1938.     The total  receipts  for the  seventeen  weeks  ended 30th April  showed a decrease of   1,325,000 or  2.6  per  cent. as  compared with the  corresponding  period  of  1938.     EMPLOYMENT. There  was a  further  improvement  in employment  between  the  13th March and  the  17th -^pril.      It  is  provisionally estimated  that at the 17th  April the number  of insured persons,  aged 16 to  64  (including those  insured undtir the  agricultural scheme and in the classes of domestic employment which became insurable at the 4th April 1938) in employment in Great Britain was approximately 12,511,000.  This was 108,000 more  than at the 13th March 1939 and (after allowing for the changes in the insured classes approximately 270,000 more than at  the 4th April 1938,      BANKING.  Clearing Bank deposits increased by  2.5 million and Clearing Bank advances by  5.4 millions between
                                                      1-7                                                      1J ifMarch and April;  -advances amounted in April to 4.-6*3%of deposits as compared with 43.6% at the &quot;beginning of1939.     The tender rate for treasury bills rose to  loll02d.in the middle of April, but declined to  1.404do by theend of the month.     FINANCIAL CONDITIONS .3R0AD.         Belgium.  During most of April the bilga was weakbut at the end of the month the granting of plenary powerto the new Government (though not of power to devaluethe belga) led to a recovery.         France. Decrees, issued during April, are a step towards a war economy.  Under these Decrees, expenditureon defence is increased by 15,000 million francs, of whichhalf is to be raised by  armaments tax of 1 per cent.on sales, the rest by the abolition of wheat and alcoholsubsidies, a  reduction in the profits  of firms engagedin armament work and by a further check on tax evasion,,Overtime rates for hours up to 45 a week are abolished;hours in the  armament industries have been greatlylengthened.     The new  Government 40 year loan bearing interest at 5% and issued at 98, intended mainly for the conversionof short term obligations, has met with a satisfactory response.     The franc remained steady throughout the month.     United States of America.  Business was unsettled  inApril owing to the international situation and the failureof domestic trade and production to  show its usualseascnalimprovement.  Retail  trade was generally  satisfactory and building  contracts increased;  but the production ofsteel and motor  cars declined.
     SHIPPING-;  The Chamber of Shipping index number offreights rose from 117.5 in March to 119.6 in April;  thefigure for April 1938 was 126.9.  Cargoes both to and from australia have improved and trade with Indian ports is onthe whole satisfactory.     Tramp shipping freights rose in April as a result of heavy chartering from the River Plate.     Laid up tonnage in ports of Great Britain and ireland on 1st April was 417,730 net tons, as compared with 452,366net tons on 1st January and 339,325 net tons on 1st April1938.  Comparable figures for British vessels only are341,285 tons, 342,423 tons, and 232,802 tons.     SHIPBUILDING.  The GovernmentVs proposals for theassistance of merchant shipbuilding have already resulted in increased activity in the shipbuilding industry, though itis not expected that the full effect of the measures will be felt for some time.  Since the announcement of the proposals the Board of Trade have been informed of the placing oforders for 147 vessels of a gross tonnage of 705,000 tons,     ENGINEERING.  There is a considerable increase in workon orders for the Government, but new civil business, apartfrom ship-building orders, has improved only a little.     Exports of machinery in the first quarter1 of 1939amounted to 108,000 tons, valued at  14.2 million, comparedwithl23,000 tons valued at  14.7 million in the first quarterof 1938.  In view of the unsettled political conditions,these figures can be regarded as relatively satisfactory;exports of machine tools have greatly increased, but exportsof many kinds of machinery, notably textile machinery, have declined.     ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY:  The decline in the volume of enquiries for plant which was already noticeable in Marchcontinued in April, especially as regards the home market.
There were, hov/ever, some important enquiries from Empiremarkets.  Orders actually placed in April were not as great asin March, which was an exceptionally favourable month, butincluded some substantial contracts.     Exports of electrical machinery, goods and apparatus werevalued in April at  1*4 million, as compared with  1.8 million in March 1939 and  1.7 million in April 1938,  Exports in thefirst four months of 1939 were valued at  6^.8 million ascompared with  7.1 million in the corresponding period of 1938.     The total amount of electricity generated by authorisedundertakers in the first four months of 1939 showed anincrease of 13fc over last year.     IRON AND STEEL:  The industry continued to work at highpressure during April.  Steel output fell from 1,170,900 tonsin March to 1,058,200 tons in-April;  April was however a shorter working month and the daily rate of output in Aprilwas higher than in March.  Production of pig iron increased from 603,600 tons in March to 608,900 tons in April-.     Government work was largely responsible for theincreased activity, but ordinary commercial business also increased, particularly as regards steel for shipbuilding,the motor industry and for tinplates.     NON-FERROUS METALS.  The general tone of the metalmarkets has been firmer.  Tin, lead and spelter prices roseduring the last three weeks of April.  The copper market wasadversely affected by reductions in the American domesticquotation, but there was a partial recovery in the last week of the month.     Demand in the United Kingdom has increased, partly forrearmament and partly for civil work.     MOTOR INDUSTRY.  New registrations of mechanicallypropelled vehicles in March were 56,821, an increase of3,004 as compared with March 1938.     The industry fear that the proposed increase in the horsepower tax will prevent the development of the export tradein large cars.
     COAL.   Activity increased to a marked extent towardsthe end of April particularly in the exporting districts;though the increased pressure of the internal demand for industrial coals has reacted favourably on productionelsewhere.   The anxiety of foreign buyers to lay in stocks and the contraction in the export trade of Germany have been largely responsible fur the improvement in exports and itis impossible to estimate for how long these factors will operate.     CHEMICALS.   Deliveries of alkali products were smallerin April than in March both, in the home and export trades.The increased demand for chemicals in the rayon indusrty was, however,  maintained.   Sales of dyestuffs in Aprilwere better than in either April 1938 or March 1959;  thedemand from the woollen trade for dyes has increased.Business in coal tar products has been limited, but demandfor wood distillation products has increased.      COTTON   Activity and production continued to expandduring April, though the volume of new orders was less thana month before.   The index of yarn output per working day was106 for April as compared with 103 in March, 1959, and 85 inApril, 1958.   The expansion was, however, largely due to theincrease in buying earlier in the year.   Exports declinedin April, but in the case of piece-goods, though not in  thatof yarns, the fall was mainly due to the small number ofworking daj^s in the month.     WOOL:  Although many firms were busy with government orders there was a decline in the activity of the industrybetween March and April.   Exports of yarns and tissuesdeclined severely, but exports of tops relatively little.     New orders for the civilian trade are scarce both on home and foreign account.  The reluctance of customers to commit themselves beyond immediate needs is clearly due  tothe political uncertainty.
                                                       W v 1     POTTERY:  There was an improvement in certain export markets during April, hut the outlook in the home marketremained discouraging, especially as regards generalearthenware and china.   Unemployment was slightly greaterthan in March;  the unemployment percentage was 20 as comparedwith 18.4 in April 1938,     TIMBjDR:    Prices of softwoods have risen in 1939 and stocks are on the short side.  A slight improvement in thebuilding industry and the requirements of the defence programme have resulted in a greater demand in this countrythan was expected and dema3ad in some other countries notablyHolland, Germany and Prance also exceeded estimates.  Hardwoodprices were fairly steady.  There has been little change inthe home market  for plywood but demand from the Continenthas caused a rise in prices.      RETAIL TRADE;   The money value of average daily sales in March was 2.3;... higher than in March 1958.  The increase was due in part to the earlier date of Easter this year.The increase in the value of average daily sales of foodsand perishables was 2.2% although the index of food prices was approximately 2.5;. lower in March than a year earlier.Average daily sales of non-food merchandise were 2.4^ higher in March than in March 1958.     The whole of this increase cannot be attributed tothe earlier date of Easter and in view of the unfavourableeffect of political uncertainty and of bad weather, theincrease was satisfactory.     AUSTRALIAN TRADE:   Bales of wool received into storeduring the nine months ended 51st March 1939 amounted to2,509,000 as compared with 2,701,000 in the correspondingperiod a year earlier;  the  quantities disposed of by sale or shipment v/ere respectively 2,296,000 and 2,148,000.     Prom  1st December 1938, to 15th April 1959, wheat and flour shipments, expressed as bushels of wheat, amounted to57,779,000 compared with 68,252,000 last year for a periodof 10 days longer.
                                                       9 f\ 9                                                       (* \) &amp;      Exports of butter from 1st Juljr 1938 to 29th Aprilamounted to 84,000 tons, of which 79,000 tons were exported to the United Kingdom.  The figures for the correspondingperiod a year earlier were respectively 78,000 and 74,000.     /Note. In the summary of reports for March circulated as A.G.434 it was wrongly stated that bales of wool receivedinto store during the 8 months ended 28th February 1939amounted to 2,981^,000 and that the quantity disposed of by sale or shipment was 2,933,000;  the correct figures wererespectively 2,428,000 and 1,937,000^7     CANADIAN TRADE;   The index of the physical volume ofbusiness rose from 111.7 in February to 113.2 in March.     Copper exports in March were the largest in history and exports of planks and boards were the highest for any Marchsince  1930.  Gold sent to the Mint reached a new high record.     The value of exports of Canadian produce in March was$76,149,000 as compared with $61,727,000 in February 1939, and$74,219,000  in March 1938.     INDIAN TRADE.  Imports (excluding Government Stores) intoIndia (excluding Burma) were valued in April at 1,340 lakhs ascompared with 1,054 lakhs in March 1959 and 1,345 lakhs inApril 1958,  Exports from India (excluding Burma) were valued at,324 lakhs in April as compared with 1,529 lakhs in March 1959and 1,266 lakhs in April 1958.     IRISH TRADE;  Imports in April were valued at  5,555,000 and exports (domestic produce) at  1,687,000 as compared with 5,077,000 and  1,565,000 respectively in April 1958;  inApril 1958, however,  shipments of livestock were delayed  in anticipation of the conclusion of the Eire-United KingdomAgreement.  The value of imports of United Kingdom origin inApril 1939 was-  242,000 more than in April, 1938, and the valueof exports (domestic produce) to the United Kingdom increasedby  367,000 or 30 per cent, in April 1939 as compared with April
  n&amp; U J     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE:  Exports from South Africa,  otherthan gold were 20*8 per cent, lower in value in March 1939than in March 1938*  Increases in the exports of wattlehark and extract and copper were outweighed toy substantialdeclines in exports of diamonds, wool, fruit and sugar.  Ashowever the value of gold exported and earmarked during Marchwas greater than that of the gold shipped in March 1933, total exports, including exported and earmarked gold, were 7.9 percent., higher in March 1939 than in March 1933.     Merchandise imports showed a small increase over imports in March 1938.     SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.  The value of British exports to south America during the first four months of 1939 declined,except to Argentina, where the increase was largely accountedfor toy the delivery of a 7,000 ton training cruiser.   Argentina.  The Argentine foreign trade &quot;balance continuesto improve, owing chiefly to the import restrictions,  whichhave not affected imports from the United Kingdom as seriouslyas imports from other cov.ntries.  The fall in prices of maizeand wheat, however, makes it difficult for a favourable balanceto be maintained;  though Argentine exports for the first quarter of 1939 increased by 17.5 per cent, in volume ascompared with the first quarter of 193 3, they showed a decreaseof 2.1 per cent, in value.   Colombia.   The value of exports of United Kingdom cotton piece goods to Colombia declined by 27.5 per cent, in thefirst four months of 1939, as compared with the corresponding-period of 1938, but exports of finished thread and woollen and worsted goods have risen in value.   Ecuador..  The Customs surcharge of 50 per cent., appliedsince July, 1937 to impqrts from countries with which Ecuadorhas an adverse trade balance, has been- discontinued.
4* to &quot;fC y i   Uruguay.  An additional quota of import exchange at the&quot;controlled&quot; rate, amounting to ,2230,000 has been grantedto the United Kingdom in respect of March;   30,000 of this sum has been set aside to pay for imports of UnitedKingdom cotton textiles.
