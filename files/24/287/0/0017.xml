Memorandum &quot;by the president.vigfr the,Board of Education.             lu   The condition of many of the public elementary        schools in Liverpool, particularly the Roman Catholic Schools        in the dockside district, has for a long time been little        short of scandalous.   Not only do these schools lack        playgrounds, proper sanitation, suitable classrooms, etc.,        but most of them are grossly over-crowded, and, according to        modern standards, the numbers of children in attendance at        them should be reduced by thousands.    The problem is to all        intents and purposes a Roman Catholic problem.   For the        Roman Catholic children in the  dockside district alone some        10,000 additional school places, out of a total of 14,000        for the whole of the City, are  needed to secure even tolerable        school conditions,             2.   The Liverpool Authority, who, in default of        alternative provision being made,  are responsible by statute        for providing for the education of the children in their area,        have been left in no doubt as to the attitude of the Board.        During the last six years their attention has been repeatedly        drawn to the impossibility of allowing such  conditions to      t  continue, and in 1935 the situation was fully discussed        between all  the parties concerned.             3.   Until the Education Act  of 1936 no satisfactory        solution could be found.   That Act, however, made possible the   &quot;                          .... 1.
                                                        In rprovision of grants from public funds for the  construction  orimprovement of voluntary senior schools.   As  soon,  therefore9as it was passed the Liverpool Roman Catholics set  to workto prepare a scheme for Roman Catholic senior  schools,  to beprovided with the help of grants from the Authority.    Thisscheme, if it could have been carried out, would have gonea long way to solve-the problem by removing  overcrowding and making satisfactory provision for the senior children.   Thescheme, estimated to cost  750,000, was submitted to theAuthority in December 1936, together with an application for grants under the Act,   The Church of England Schoolauthorities also submitted proposals for grants for theprovision of two or three^Church of England  senior schools,but in general were content that the elder children attending the Church of Elngland schools should be provided for incouncil schools.     4,.   The discussion of the scheme at first centred onthe Question whether the Authority&apos;s grant should be at the                 orate of 75 or 65per cent of the cost.   8h03?tly, however,before the municipal elections in November 1937 the thenleader of the Conservative Party announced that !no grant  todenominational schools&apos; would be one of the  planks in his party&apos;s platform.   This decision was stated to be based on grounds of economy.   As hotrever the only alternative to making grants towards the provision of voluntary schools wasto build council schools wholly at the Authority&apos;s expense,the alleged grounds for the decision were clearly not thereal ones, but the manoeuvre was a successful one, the localConservatives gaining a substantial number of seats.   InApril 1933 the Authority formally decided to make no grants under the Education Act, 1936, for denominational schools,and. instructed their Education Committee  to proceed with
the provision of council schools needed in order to  complywith the provisions of the Education Acts.    The Authoritytook nearly 18 months to come to this decision,  and  even if itwere now to he reversed it would be impossible for the voluntary school bodies to obtain any advantage  from suchreversal, because the 1936 Act enables grants to be  made only in respect of works which are capable of completionby 1st September, 1940.   The result is that it  is notpossible to work the 1936 Act in Liverpool.     5o   In making their decision to build council  schools in preference to giving grants towards the building  of voluntary schools the Authority were acting within theirlegal rights, but it was as obvious to them as to the board that a satisfactory organisation of council schools  would beimpossible without the co-operation of the Roman Catholics,They knew also that there was no prospect of securing this for such a purpose, and that the attendance of Roman Catholicchildren at council schools could not be secured except bywholesale prosecution of parents, which in the peculiarcircumstances of Liverpool would inevitably lead to  serioussocial disorder.     6.   The Board, when informed of the Authority&apos;decision, asked for a statement of the measures  which they proposed to take to deal with the problem.    It was  thenfound that no satisfactory proposals were forthcoming andthat the Authority had reached their &quot;no grant&quot;  decision without having any bcna fide alternative scheme.  accordingly the Board decided to withhold  15,000 from each of the monthly instalments of  grant payable to the Authority, onthe ground that the Board were not satisfied that theAuthority were fulfilling their duty under the Education Acts.This decision was notified to the Authority on 5th July, 193S.                          3.
ionJL 0 i     7.    In February, last at the request of the  AuthorityI had an informal discussion with a small representativedeputation which laid before me certain suggestions forresolving the deadlock.    While not refusing to consider  ascheme based on these suggestions, if local agreement weresecured, I declined to commit myself in any way,  and pointedout the difficulties which any such scheme would have to face.   In order, however, not to prejudice local negotiationsI agreed that the withholding of grant should be discontinuedwithout prejudice to the question of what action would betaken regarding the amount actually withheld, amounting  toabout  105,000.     S.    The Authority, desiring to find a way out of theimpasse in which they have landed themselves, have now submitted the attached scheme of which the following are theessential features.        (a)   The Authority will themselves provide school   sites and buildings in substitution for those for which   the denominational school authorities submitted proposals   under the Education Act, 1936, within the time limits   allowed by Section 8(2) of that Act, and will lease the   school premises so provided to the denominational   authorities on terms to be approved by the Board.        (b)   The appointment of teachers in the leased   schools will be in accordance with the provisions of   Section 10(l) of  the Education Act, 1936, the proportion   of 1 reserved&apos; teachers in each school being arranged in   accordance with the circumstances of the school.   The Board  in  considering the  terms of these leases will of course have to be satisfied that they are not morefavourable to  either party than  is consistent with  theprovisions of  Section 8(5) of the Education Act, 1936.                         4.
                                                        1 ?2                                                        x v &apos;)    9.     On receipt of these proposals from the authority the amount of grant previously withheld was paid over to them,as it was clear that they were making a genuine effort to solve the problem.   10o     It will be noted that the Authority&apos;s scheme is limited to those particular schools for which proposals hadbeen  submitted under the 1936 Act, and which would have been built if that Act had been administered in Liverpool as itwas intended to be administered,.   It involves therefore no permanent or continuing alteration in the law, and confers  onthe Roman Catholics no greater advantage than they might havereceived under the 1936 Act.   lie     Legislation would bevrequired to give effect tothese proposals.   The case for the special treatment of liverpool is on practical grounds exceptionally strong;  in noother part of the country is there concentrated so large anddense a Roman Catholic population or so many schools of sodeplorable a character.   Moreover, although the proposals might be suspect in the eyes of opponents of the dual system,it is known that the legislation would have the support of liverpool members regardless of creed or party.   It will beseen  from the attached document that the Committee whichworked out the scheme contained representatives of all  the religious denominations.   Moreover, the Liverpool Free ChurchCentre has passed a strongly worded resolution approving thesettlement and any legislation needed to give effect to it.I have thought it best to treat the matter  on a local basis and have not, therefore, approached the Free Church Councilin London.   I have, however, discussed it  informally withdraw. Scott Lidgett who has authorised me to  say that he considers  the solution  to be a good one in the peculiarcircumstances of Liverpool, but would be averse to its
                                                       i Q Aextension to the whole -country. &apos;  Even Mr. Longbottom,  thefanatical leader of the anti-Catholics, supported it inCouncil, and the proposal originated from Alderman Sherman,the present leader of the Conservative Party which fought the1937 election on the cry of &quot;no grants to denominationalschools&quot;.   Indeed, the real proof of the ^uniqueness of thesituation is the extent to which these irreconcilableelements have determined to agree.    12.     The normal way of dealing with a deficiency of school accommodation is by the provision  of council schools,but, as explained above, council schools will not solve theproblem in Liverpool.   Unless a solution on some such lines as those suggested by the Authority is achieved, the problemof school accommodation in Liverpool must, as far as I amable to see, be regarded as insoluble, and this result Ishould regard, and I feel sure all my  colleagues who have occupied my post would also regard, as deplorable.   Weshould in any case be incurring a heavy responsibility byacquiescing in the continuance of a situation so damaging tothe health and education of the children  of Liverpool, a responsibility which might at  any time be brought home to us by loss of life consequent upon fire  or panic.   To reject  ascheme which commands unanimous local assent would be to  add to our responsibilities in this respect.    13.     My advice to my colleagues is that  we should accept the scheme  put forward  by  Liverpool  and  announce  thatwe are prepared to legislate to that  end,   I do not regard this as  a  d.angerous  precedent  since,  even if any  other authority  desired  legislation  on  similar  lines,  it  would be easy to  resist  them  on  the  around that in no other  area  are
there large &quot;blocks of Eoman Catholic population comparable with those in LiverpoolP or conditions that constitute alarge-scale social as well as educational scandal.                                         DoJune 14th? 1939,

   The Joint Advisory Committee now report that they  have held six meetings,  under  the  Chairmanship of  Alderman A. E.  Shennan,  at which the  subject referred to them has received the closest investigation and consideration.  At these meetings, the various aspects of the posi- tion, both financial and otherwise,  regarding the schools in question, have been  carefully examined in the light of Reports submitted to the Committee by the Town Clerk, the City  Treasurer and the Director of Education.  The Chairman  of the Joint  Advisory Committee  and  the  Officers named have  also  interviewed representatives of the Board of Educa- tion on several points which required  elucidation.  In the result, the Joint Advisory Committee have reached the unani-mous decision,  after thorough consideration,  that  the most satisfactory solution of the problem  involved is to  be found in the following terms which they  recommend  to  be  agreed  with the  Voluntary  SchoolAuthorities in  regard to the leasing of the Senior Schools required  tobe built, viz. :          1.  That the  Council should purchase the sites and erect the      necessary number of  Senior  School buildings  required  by the      provisions of the Education Acts,  1921  and 1936.        2.  (a) That where  any such building is provided in substitu-      tion for  a building  or buildings contemplated in proposals sub-      mitted  by  Denominational   School Authorities to the  Local      Education Authority under Section 8 of the Education Act, 1936,      within  the time-limits allowed by  that  Section,   the  Council      shall (subject to the necessary powers  being granted by Parlia-      ment)  where  desired  by a Denominational  Authority, -grant a      lease of  the building  to  that Authority for a period of fifty      years,  with the option to  the Denominational School Authority      to renew the lease on terms to be  agreed and in the event of differ-      ence to be  settled  by the Board  of Education, and  also with the      option to either party to  determine the lease at any time in the      event of the premises not being further required for  the purposes      of a non-provided school.
f Q JX    M   (6) That if any difference of opinion shall arise as to whether the  premises  are further required for such purposes, such differ- ence of opinion shall  be  submitted to the Board-of  Education, whose decision shall be binding upon both parties.   3.
