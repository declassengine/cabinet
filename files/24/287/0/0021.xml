Copy No.    /-*-CP. 138 (39).CABINET.Committee on the Defence of India.REPORT ON  THE REPORT  OF  THE EXPERT  COMMITTEE  ON THE                          DEFENCE OF  INDIA.                                Introduction.     WE are now in a position to make a Report to  the Cabinet on the recom-mendations of the Expert Committee which went out to India last autumn underthe chairmanship of Lord Chatfield.  The Report of  the Committee in question(hereafter referred to as the Chatfield Report) has already been circulated to theCabinet (CP. 133 (39)).     2.  The origin of the enquiry out of which the Expert Committee arose isto be found in the following extract from a letter, dated the 9th February, 1938,from the Secretary to  the  Government of  India to the  Secretary, MilitaryDepartment, India Office :i          &quot; The Government of India would  strongly urge upon His Majesty&apos;s     Government  that the present condition of the world and the recent develop-     ments in the  constitutional position of India have produced a situation which     calls for a redetermination of India&apos;s defence problem in both its military     and financial aspects, and for the conclusion of a new &apos; contract&apos; between the     United Kingdom and India, in  which  India&apos;s financial  limitations  are     recognised.&quot;     3.  Following on the above representation, a deputation was  sent to Englandby the Government of India.  Conversations took place between this deputation and  the Government Departments concerned  with problems of Indian Defence;an interdepartmental sub-committee,  which included members  of this  deputa-tion, was assembled in London, under the chairmanship of Major-General H. R.Pownall, Director of Military Operations and Intelligence.   At a later date, theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee were invited  to review the results of the aboveenquiries and finally on the 29th June, 1938 (Cabinet 30 (38),  Conclusion (6)), thepresent Cabinet  Committee was set up to consider  and report on the wholequestion.    4.  An  interim Report  was presented to the Cabinet on the 18th July(CP. 174 (38)).   In this Report we recommended that, as an immediate measure,and without prejudice to the ultimate main decisions of policy, the  War office should  be authorised to  arrange for the transfer of  four British infantry battalions from the Indian to the British Establishment, as soon as the necessarybarrack accommodation was ready.  The  Cabinet approved this recommendation(Cabinet 34 (38),  Conclusion (1)).      [19473]                                                      b
    5.   Our Second Report was presented to the Cabinet on the 29th July, 1938(CP. 187 (38)).  Our principal recommendations were summarised as follows :-  &quot; (i) We are convinced that early action to place India&apos;s defence organisation          on a more up-to-date and satisfactory basis is most essential.   (ii) The immediate measures which we recommend to this end are :           (a)  The modernisation of one mixed Division, which is to be regarded                 as an Imperial  Reserve; and          (&amp;)  The re-equipment  of the four  existing Royal Air Force bomber                 squadrons in India.

Defence  Budget of  the  Government of          India :           (a)  A sum,  not exceeding  5 millions, to meet the capital cost of the                 modernisation of the Imperial Reserve Division.          (b)  An annual contribution, with effect from,  the 1st April, 1939, of                 an additional  500,000 (over and above the annual contribution                 of  1^ million  which is already paid) towards the recurring                 maintenance costs of the  Imperial  Reserve Division.          (c)  The capital cost of the new aircraft required in order to re-equip                 the four existing Royal Air Force bomber squadrons in India.    (v) We do not recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should, at present          at any rate, make any contribution towards the modernisation of the          remainder of the Army and Royal Air Force in India, other than the          Imperial Reserve Division and the four  squadrons.   (vi) We recommend that a Committee of Inquiry  should proceed to India at          an  early date to consider and report whether  savings can be made in          existing Indian Defence  expenditure to set  against  the cost of          modernisation of the Defence Forces in India, and in particular to          meet  increased  future  maintenance  charges  involved  in  that          modernisation, and in the improved  conditions of service.&quot;        *JA.

The actual terms of  reference of the Committee of Inquiry appointed in accordance with the Cabinet decision were settled shortly afterwards at an inter-departmental Conference, and were as follows :           &quot; In  the light of the recent Report  by the Chiefs of Staff,  and of the    Reports of the  Cabinet  Committee on the Defence of India,  and having    regard to the increased cost of  modern  armaments, to the desirability of    organising, equipping and maintaining the Forces  in  India in  accordance    with modern requirements, and to the  limited resources available in India    for defence expenditure,.to examine and report, in the light of experience    gained in executing the British re-armament programme, how these resources    can be used to the best advantage, and  to make recommendations.&quot;    7.  The Chatfield Committee, after  preliminary  meetings of the main body in London,  sailed for  India on the 26th October, 1938;  and arrived in India onthe 7th November, having been joined at Port Said by the representative of theGovernment of India Major-General Auchinleck.  They completed their Reporton the 30th January, 1939; and on the 5th  February we were re-appointed, as aCabinet Committee, to examine and report  on it.     8.  In  the  course of our  enquiry we have had  before us a comprehensiveReport by the  Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the military aspects of  theproposals put4 forward by the Chatfield  Committee, and a Memorandum by the
                              -&apos;&apos; I                                            to                                     3Chancellor of the Exchequer on their financial  aspects.   We have also had theadvantage of discussions with Lord Chatfield himself, and with Sir James Grigg(recently Finance Member of the Governor-General V Council).    9.  After this brief explanation of the decisions in respect of the defence ofIndia which were taken last summer,  of the events leading up to the preparationof the Chatfield Committee Report, and of the  technical advice which has been available  to us in our  examination of its  proposals, we now submit our ownopinions and recommendations.    10.   Subject to the relatively minor modifications which are suggested later in this Report, we are in  agreement  with the principal conclusions  of the chatfield Committee, and with the principal recommendations which they have put forward for the re-organisation  of India&apos;s Defence Forces.   In the specialcircumstances of the present time, we think there is  no alternative to  their acceptance more or less  in their entirety.  Accordingly, we propose to confine ourcomments to     (a) Those features of the Chatfield Report which,  in our  judgment, merit           the special attention of the Cabinet.    (b) Those of  its proposals which, in our  view,  require some modification           either in their  substance or their application.       The Principles on tuhich the Re-organisation Proposals: are Based.     11.   Before proceeding to consider the re-organisation proposals themselves, we think it right to offer some observations on the fundamental principles on which these proposals have been based.     12.   The first  principle  is  implicit  in the  following extract  from  the Chatfield Committee&apos;s  Report (paragraph 19) :           &quot; . . .  .  We  have been able to proceed on no other  assumption  than     that a settled defence policy can and will be laid down, in accordance with     the principle that  responsibility for the defence of India rests, through the     Governor-General  and the Secretary of State for India,  with, the British     Government and with no one else,  and that  this  responsibility will in no     respect be weakened whatever political pressure is brought to bear on the     Government of India either before or after the coming of Federation.  This     assumption appears to us to be definitely essential, not only to the continuity     of any plans which may be based on our recommendations, but,  indeed,  to     the  making of defence plans  of such a general and far-reaching nature  as     we have been called on to make.&quot;     We submit this assumption to the Cabinet for approval.      13.  The second principle on  which the re-organisation proposals are based is enunciated by the Chatfield Committee (paragraph 69 of their Report) in the following terms :           &quot; On these grounds we  consider that the distinction drawn in the      Garran  Report between the &apos; major &apos;  and the &apos; minor &apos; danger cannot now      be accepted as a valid or practicable criterion.  The general principle that      we would put  forward in its place is  that the forces maintained in India      should be adequate not merely for the narrower  purposes of purely local      defence, but also  to assist in  ensuring her  security  against the  external      threats that we have described;  and, further, that India should acknowledge      that her responsibility cannot, in her own interests, be safely limited to the      local defence of her land frontiers and coasts.....But quite clearly  in      our view the principle on which the financial arrangements  between the two      Governments should be based  is that India should bear some share in a joint      responsibility for her external  security.  It may not be practicable to give      full effect to the principle  so  long as financial stringency dominates the      Indian situation.   Nevertheless, we think it of the first importance that the      principle should be accepted and widely recognised, and reasonable  effect      given to it so far  as is financially possible.&quot;        [19473]                                                      B  2
* Paper No. C.O.S. 874, paragraphs 4 and 5.     14-  We ourselves fully accept this principle, but we imagine that it is one which political opinion m India may find it very difficult to accept.  The Viceroy holds  the view that any public declaration to the above effect will result in a storm of protest in India, and may lead to a major political crisis unless it is handled from the outset with complete firmness.  Nevertheless, he is prepared to face these risks, provided that the recommendations of the Chatfield Committee are, accepted m their entirety by His Majesty&apos;s Government and  that he can be assured of the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government in any measures which he may find it necessary to take in the event of a major political crisis.   .; 15.  There is. a further question of principle to which we invite particular attention. The proposals of the Chatfield Report are based on the existing policv of the  Government of India in  regard to  the  tribal  territory of the Western Frontier.  Chapter 3 of the Committee&apos;s  Report is devoted  to a  study  of this policy,  and the Committee&apos;s views are summarised in paragraphs 259 and 260 of the Report, in the following terms :          &quot; 259.  We are disturbed by the nature of the evidence we have received,     indicating as it does the widest difference of view among important officials     as  to the merits or the purposes of  the measures now in operation and as to     the wisest methods of achieving the aim of the Forward Policy.         260.  We recommend that very early steps should be taken to review the     Frontier Policy in its entirety with the object not only of clarifying  the     policy, but  also of defining the practical objectives to be aimed at&quot; and  the     methods by which they are to be reached.&quot;     16.  The Chiefs  of  Staff* expressed  complete  agreement  with the above recommendation.  &quot; We think it most important,&quot; they state, &quot; from the military point of view, that the above review should take place as soon as  possible.  we also wish to emphasise that, by reason of the operational commitments which itmay involve for our forces, both land and air, Frontier policy has a direct bearingupon our Imperial Defence position.  The policy which it might be desirable  for local reasons to pursue, if  the international situation  were undisturbed, mightentail grave dangers at the present time.  We would urge that this factor  shouldbe taken fully into account in reaching conclusions as  to the Frontier policy tobe adopted during the next few years.  Meanwhile, having regard to the fact thata large  proportion of the forces, which the Expert  Committee recommend  shouldbe retained and modernised, are  required for India&apos;s existing Frontier commit-ment, we find it difficult to give immediate advice as to the strength and characterof the instrument which should be forged to implement a policy which is liableto be substantially changed.                    4    In  normal times we should have asked permission to postpone our detailed recommendations as to the reorganisation and  equipment of the forces in Indiauntil we had  received guidance as to the precise functions which they were to  berequired to discharge.  The present times, however, are not normal, and we regard it of the first importance that there should be no avoidable delay in modernisingand strengthening our forces all over the world.  Moreover, if a change is decided upon, it must, of necessity, be experimental and gradual.  In these  circumstances we recommend that,  subject to the observations on points of detail which are putforward later  in this Report,  general approval should  be  accorded  to there organisation  proposals  contained  in  the  Report of the  Expert Committee,subject  to modification, if necessary, as soon as conclusions have been reached onFrontier Policy.&quot;    We find ourselves in full agreement with the view put forward by the Chiefsof Staff in the preceding sentence.    17.   We have asked  the  Secretary of State for India to  ascertain theViceroy&apos;s reactions to the suggested review on Frontier Policy.  Lord Linlithgowhas replied that he already had this matter in hand and that, in point of fact,considerable material had already been collected  before the Chatfield Committeehad arrived, in India.  We are informed that the collection.of material has nowbeen completed  and that the whole  question  is  under  consideration  by theGovernment of. India.             ,-    .
    When Lord Linlithgow&apos;s views have been received there will be  a numberof questions requiring careful consideration;  for  example,  the nature of &quot;anyfurther enquiry that may be decided upon, the financial implications of a changein policy or method, and the use of the air weapon on the Frontier, in connectionwith which attention  is invited to the note appended to  the  Chatfield Report(page 66) by Air Marshal Courtney, who is of opinion that the best use of lndia&apos;sair forces will not be achieved without some change in the present machinery.    The Secretary of State for Air considers that our Frontier policy should be such that it could  be implemented  to  a greater extent by  air power, with a consequential saving in troops and money.    18.  We invite attention to  paragraphs 57 to 63 of the Chatfield Report.The Committee there  describe, and  comment on, the various methods of  usingAir Forces in India in a primary role,  and they &quot;  regard it as quite out of thequestion that in these  days there could be any relaxation of the long-establishedrestrictions on  the use of Air Forces on the Frontier in time of peace &quot; (para-graph 63).    The Secretary of  State for India has informed us that the Viceroy is incomplete agreement with the views of the Chatfield  Committee.    19.  We endorse the  Chatfield  Committee&apos;s proposal for a comprehensive review of Frontier policy, but, having regard to the considerations set out inthe preceding paragraphs,  we do not think it would be right  for us to  formulateany detailed recommendations as to how, and  by whom,  this  review  should beundertaken until such  time as a Report is received from the Viceroy.  .                   The Military Aspects of the Proposals.    20.  We now turn to an examination of the military aspects of the proposalsfor the reorganisation of India&apos;s defence forces.  By way of introduction we inviteattention  to the following significant  extract from  a Report which the  Chiefsof Staff prepared  for us in May 1938 (Paper  No. CCS.  737) :-        &quot;It is abundantly clear  .... that neither the Army nor Air Force    in India are  at present in any shape  to discharge many of the Imperial    commitments  which in certain circumstances they  may  be  called upon  to    meet.&quot;    21.  The object of the reorganisation proposals is to remedy this state  ofaffairs and to provide India with modernised defence forces capable of playinga far more effective part in modern warfare.   So  far  as the local defence  ofIndia is concerned, the  scheme will result in a marked reduction in the numberof troops to be maintained, but the greatly increased  striking-power and mobilitywhich will result from the modernisation of equipment and extension of mechinisation-sation  should compensate for this reduction in numbers. So far as  the external defence of India is concerned, the forces which  India will be able to despatchoverseas will be equipped on a scale which will enable them  to meet any  hostileforces against which they are likely to be employed,  and to co-operate effectively with any other Imperial Forces which may  be similarly engaged.    22.  We ought to  add that the scheme of reorganisation is, in the main,based on proposals which were formulated by the Commander-in-Chief in Indiahimself (see paragraph 78) and that  he assured the  Chatfield  Committee  that&quot; although both land and air forces are on a strictly minimum basis, he is satisfiedthat taken together  they are  sufficient for  the  local  defence of India,  and  tocarry out  the strategic  policy which he has  in mind&quot; (paragraph 168).The Army in India.  ;  23.  Subject to minor modifications, the Chiefs of Staff have recommended the acceptance of the proposals for the strength and  distribution of the Army  inIndia which are set out in Chapter 6 of the Chatfield Report.  We  endorse thisrecommendation.
     24.   There are, however, certain matters in connection with  the External Defence Troops which call for special mention.  In  the first place, it will be seen from the conclusions quoted in paragraph 5 above  that the original intention was that there should be  an  &quot;Imperial Reserve Division.&quot;   If the principle quoted in paragraph 13 is  accepted, it is&apos; clear,  as  the Chatfield  Committee suggest in paragraph 71 of their  Eeport, that  &quot;the forces that  can be  made available  from India to assist in the protection of her external interests should form an  integral part  of  the forces in  India as a whole.&quot;   This seems to us to call  for some modification of the original conception of the  Imperial Reserve Division,  and the title &quot;External Defence Troops&quot;  which has  been suggested by the Chatfield Committee is, in our view, to be preferred.     25.   Secondly, the Chatfield Committee  have recommended (paragraphs 93 and 109) that the External Defence Troops need not be organised on a divisional basis.   The  Chiefs  of  Staff, while  agreeing  that  some decentralisation of administrative units on  a &quot; Brigade  Group &apos;&apos; basis is  acceptable in view of the probable roles of the External Defence. Troops, are of  opinion that a Divisional Headquarters including the Command should  exist in peace.  They anticipate that two of the Brigade Groups may well be required to operate together in war, and the existence of a Commander and Staff who have trained the troops in peace, and are accustomed to dealing with Indian troops, seems to them most necessary. We endorse the above opinion.  We are informed that this is a matter which can be adjusted between  the General Staffs at Home and in  India, and we recommend that the view expressed by the Chiefs  of Staff should be accepted.    26.  The Chiefs of Staff have also suggested that, in view of the duties which will fall to the External Defence Troops, the Government of India should consult the War Office in the nomination of Commanders and staffs for  the  formation of their headquarters.  We support this recommendation as  logical and equitable.    27.  As we have pointed out in paragraph 21 above, it is an essential feature of the reorganisation proposals to obtain  greater  striking power and mobility by means  of  modernisation, while reducing the actual numerical strength of the Forces maintained.  For the latter  purpose drastic withdrawals and reductions of troops are proposed.  Details of the units thus rendered surplus are shown in the Annex to this Report.  The Annex shows the recommendations  put forward by the Chiefs of Staff for absorbing some of the units in question.    28.  So far as the British units are concerned, effect has already been given to these recommendations.    29.  So far as Indian units are concerned, we recommend  acceptance of the proposals  of the Chiefs of Staff that three battalions of Indian Infantry shouldbe retained on the Imperial  Establishment  for  duty  outside  India  (at Aden,Hong Kong and Taiping), and  that as  many ex-sepoys as can usefully be employedshould be  provided with employment in  the  Singapore Police  Force.  We  alsorecommend that the War Office should have authority to arrange,  if the Govern-ment of India  agree, for one of the surplus Indian Cavalry Regiments to be allotted the role of  Divisional Cavalry  Regiment  with  the External defence troops, thus releasing one further British  Cavalry  Regiment  for  the HomeEstablishment.    30.  Assuming that the above recommendations are approved by the Cabinet,there will still  be 2  Indian Cavalry Regiments, 11  Indian Infantry Battalions, and a  number of ancillary troops to be  disbanded.  The  Chiefs of Staff  have drawn attention to the obvious disadvantages in  the present world situation ofdisbanding any Regular units.  We agree with  this view, and we are glad to be ableto report  that  the Government of India have agreed  that no disbandment of surplus Indian units should take place for a further 12  months, and are preparedto accept their upkeep for this period  as a charge on the Indian Defence Budget. The Royal A ir Force in India.    iii.  The  Chatfield Committee were unable  to  reach  agreement as to the strength of the; ajr forces which should be  maintained  for India&apos;s local defence requirements    They therefore based their financial appreciation on the  opinionof the Commander-in-Chief in India, that for local defence 4 Bomber Squadrons,3 Army Co-operation Squadrons, and 1 Bomber  Transport  Squadron would
suffice.  The Chiefs of Staff, on the other hand, record the opinion that a minimum of 6 Bomber Squadrons is required for local defence purposes.   As indicated above, this would involve an addition both to the capital and to the recurring coston which the Chatfield Committee&apos;s estimates are based.    The additional Bomber Squadrons could  not in any event be supplied forsome time, and  there is therefore no action which  can  be taken until circurh-stances  allow practical  consideration to be given  to  the questions of equipment,personnel and finance.   In the meanwhile we recommend  that the  Chiefs of staff should give special consideration to this point  in the course of their examinationof the Indian War Plan.    32.  In this connection it was suggested to us by Lord Chatfield that it wouldbe of great advantage if the Commander-in-Chief in India could be invited tocome to England to explain his plan, and discuss  it with the Chiefs of Staff andthe Committee of Imperial  Defence.   The Secretary  of  State  for  India has undertaken to consult the Viceroy on this matter.    33.  The  Chatfield Report  recommends  the   provision  of two  bomber squadrons in  respect of the  External  Defence commitment as representing themaximum contribution  which India can be called upon to  provide  unless theannual grant of  2 million from the Home Exchequer is increased.   The Chiefsof Staff, on  the  other  hand,  state that their plans for the  reinforcement of singapore and Egypt require a total of 6  squadrons, 3  for each  place.    these squadrons need not necessarily be  located in India.  For the time being, however,the Chiefs of Staff hope that the additional  commitment hitherto accepted by india to send 4 squadrons out of India in an emergency may stand.    34.  The  Commander-in-Chief in India has indicated  that, if an emergencywere to arise at the present time, he  would not be able to  spare more than2 squadrons, having regard to the conditions now prevailing in India. In thesecircumstances we consider that the  question of providing air reinforcements forthe Middle and Far East is a matter which the Secretary of State  for Air should raise in the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Royal Indian Navy; The Coast Defence of India; The Ordnance Factories.    35.  We approve the recommendations of the Chatfield Committee under theabove headings, and have no particular questions to bring to  the notice of theCabinet.  So far  as Coast Defence is concerned, the proposals are  under detailed examination by the Joint Oversea  and Home Defence Committee.                                  Finance.    36.  The  above  recommendations  all necessarily assume that the requisitefunds will be available to finance  the new organisation,  and the re-equipment ofthe forces maintained  in  India  to  the scale  proposed.   There  is, however,a constant and emphatic demand  by  Indians of  all parties for  a reductionof  Defence  expenditure, which  is  wholly  charged  on  the Budget  of theCentral Government.  Defence absorbs at the  present time some  36-4 millions,or more than  half of the revenue of  about  64  millions raised on the CentralBudget.  Our own inquiries  confirm the information obtained in India by the chatfield Committee  to the effect that any attempt at the  present time to increaseexpenditure on Defence above its present figure would create the gravest political difficulties.  Neither  now nor during  the next five years does  it  appear  that itwould be possible to raise any substantial amount of  additional revenue, to  covermilitary or other  expenditure by the Centre.    37.  Put briefly, the financial effect of the Chatfield Committee&apos;s labours isthat a plan has been produced which will give India a military machine of greatlyincreased efficiency, including provision for External Defence  purposes, withoutany increase in the maintenance charges  falling on India&apos;s Defence Budget.  Thisleads to the only possible alternative, namely, that the British  taxpayer should beprepared to find the  initial  capital cost  (estimated at   34-33 millions).   we discuss  later  (paragraph 46) the extent to which this  assistance should be inthe form of grant and  loan respectively.   As the Cabinet will appreciate, our recommendation  in paragraph 10  above,  in  favour of  the  acceptance  of theprincipal conclusions of the  Chatfield Report,  proceeded  on the assumption that
this heavy burden should be borne by the Home Exchequer, despite its existingdifficulties.  This is our recommendation.    38.  If the  Cabinet  are prepared to approve this course we suggest that itshould be laid down as a condition of  affording this assistance to  India, that,subject to the  separate  consideration of the cost of any major  additions  orvariations that may be approved as a  result of the decisions on the ChatfieldReport as a whole, no more capital assistance will be  forthcoming in the eventof the  initial capital cost exceeding the estimate of   34-33 millions.   Theassumption must be that, if signs appear that the total is likely for other reasons to be exceeded, the Government of India will be under an obligation either tobear the excess themselves, or to find economies which can be set off against it.    39.   Similarly, and subject to the same condition, the Government of  india should be liable for any increased maintenance charges,  in  so far as  they are the direct result of the actual reorganisation now contemplated.  On the other hand.it is possible that maintenance charges may be increased  owing to changes whichhave no direct connection with this reorganisation, e.g., the  necessity for ensuring that the British soldier in India  shares in any improvements effected  in  theconditions of service of the British  soldier at home.    40.  In these circumstances we do  not  recommend that any hard and fastdecision of principle should be taken at the present time in respect of maintenancecharges.  At the same  time we consider  that in normal cases of increased cost ofmaintenance  from whatever  cause  the  principles  should  apply  which  areenunciated in paragraph 248 of the Chatfield Report, which reads as follows :          &quot; We should add that we strongly  deprecate any  suggestion that India    should make a fixed or maximum provision for defence and that anything    required for maintenance charges over  and  above that figure should  be  met    by  a  variation of the contribution  from His Majesty&apos;s  Government.   We    regard it as axiomatic that, with the help of such reasonable contribution as    His Majesty&apos;s Government  may  make  towards  the  cost of India&apos;s  defence    forces so far as they are satisfying what we  look  upon as a joint responsi-    bility, India should meet the whole maintenance cost of her forces out of her    own resources.&quot;    41.   We draw the attention of the Cabinet to paragraph 75 of the ChatfieldReport, which contemplates that, in the event of troops specially allocated for thatpurpose being employed outside India in an emergency affecting India&apos;s externalsecurity, their ordinary maintenance charges will  continue to be borne by India,instead of His Majesty&apos;s Government paying the whole bill, as  has often beenthe case in the past.   The Government of India have said that they are preparedto accept this liability, provided always that  the recommendations of the ChatfieldCommittee as a whole are accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    42.   Turning again to the  capital  cost of modernising the Defence Forcesin India,  we find it contemplated  in  paragraph 240 of the Expert  Committee&apos;sReport that this initial expenditure should be spread over a five-year period, partly in India and partly in England, as follows : The result of literal adherence to this time-table would be to throw a disproportionate-tionately  heavy burden  on the already difficult  financial years 1939-40 and1940-41.    43.  It is relevant, however, to point out that the estimates in paragraph 240of the Chatfield Report  were framed before recent decisions were taken whichhave considerably increased the  supply  requirements of the Army at home.  Sofar as is practicable, we have ascertained the extent to which those  increases ofhome  requirements  are likely to slow down  the progress of re-equipment of theArmy  in  India, as compared with the above estimates.

to have priority  part passu.determining the rate at which India&apos;s demands can be met, it is necessary as a.preliminary to establish an order of priority as between their  demands and theother demands on supply.  We submit for approval the following order of supplypriority :                       .. .   ;  (a) the war equipment and reserves for six Regular British Divisions and           two Territorial Divisions which are being prepared to proceed over-           seas within the first four months of war,  and training equipment for           the balance of the Field Force.,     (b) the External Defence Troops to be maintained in India.     (c)&apos; (i) the balance of war  equipment and the  reserves j               for  the  remainder   of  the  Territorial               Divisions, and        (ii) the remainder of the Army in  India     44.  Broadly  speaking, it  seems  probable that  some  9,000,000 (of  which 3,850,000 has already appeared in the Estimates for India and Burma Services)can  be spent on proposals which will complete the remainder of the external defence Troops, and will set in hand the first two years&apos; programme of the Navaland  Air Forces.   To this may be added approximately  7,000,000 which it  isestimated can be spent by the Government of India on  other parts of  the pro-gramme not affected by the question of priorities at home.  In the first two years,therefore, of the working of the Chatfield scheme  the capital expenditure willbe about   16,000,000,  as compared with  the Expert Committee&apos;s  estimate of 19-85 million.   Three or four million pounds will  thus be &quot; pushed forward &quot;into the third, fourth and fifth years.     45.  In this connection we ought to mention that we have been advised thatsome difficulty may be  experienced  in  providing  dollar exchange to financepurchases in America, e.g., of vehicles  or machine tools.  This difficulty may ariseboth on certain items which are included in the  9,000,000 (completion of  equip-ment of the External Defence Troops) and on those included in the  7,000,000(estimated expenditure by the Government of India not  affected by priorities athome).     46.  We   recommend  the  adoption   of  the  expedient   suggested   inparagraph 252 of the Chatfield Report:           &quot; We would  suggest for consideration that  the whole sum ultimately     required should not be given by way of grant but that some proportion of it,     say one-fourth (or the excess over a fixed sum), should be advanced by way     of loan, the service of which might, in view of India&apos;s immediate  financial     difficulties,  be postponed  until  modernisation had been completed.  The     position could then be reviewed and arrangements come to for the liquidation     of the sum advanced by way of loan.  If the sum required to be liquidated     were of the size we have in mind, and India had not to encounter further     financial  troubles  of  a serious kind, we do not believe there  should be any     insurmountable difficulties in providing for the service of the loan out of her     current resources.&quot;We consider that the amount of the loan should be, as indicated above, one-quarterof the total estimated capital cost of  34- 33 millions, the remainder being a giftfrom His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Government of India.  Interest on the loanshould be entirely remitted in respect of the first five years, after which interestshould  begin  to be paid, together with  instalments  of capital.   The detailed arrangements should be settled  in consultation between the Chancellor  of  theExchequer and the Secretary of  State for India.     47.   It will be appreciated that  the object of putting part of the assistance given by the Home Exchequer in the form of a loan is not only to secure in the long-run a contribution from India,  when she can afford to make one, but also  tofurnish the Government of India with a financial interest in seeing the moneyeconomically spent.     48.   If the Cabinet approve the recommendations which we have made in thecourse of the  present Report, we think it is important that they should be com-municated to  the Government of India at a very early date.  The Viceroy and hiscolleagues are most anxious to receive authority to proceed at once with the plan of reorganisation  and  re-equipment which forms Part  II of the Chatfield Report.
   - -              .....          General.  .    .    ...    49.  It would not be right for us to conclude this Report without a referenceto certain other questions of a general character.-Co-ordination of Defence between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the  Govern-         ment of India.    50.  The Report which the  Chiefs of Staff prepared for us  in July 1938(Paper No. CCS.  737) included the following paragraphs :          &quot; 36. In India itself the system and organisation of the  Committee of    Imperial Defence  have already been adopted in certain respects. There is,    for example, a Principal Supply&quot; Officers Committee Organisation in  India,    on the Home model, which keeps in close touch with its counterpart in this ;.   country; there is an Indian  War  Book modelled and based on the United    Kingdom War Book;  and so forth.   In addition, Sir Ivo Vesey informed    us that a Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, which includes the Admiral Com-    manding the Royal Indian Navy, has recently been established.  This Com-    mittee, however, is not a parallel  organisation to the Chiefs  of Staff Sub-    Committee of the Committee  of Imperial Defence.         37.  All these  arrangements are in the right direction.  But we submit    that they do not go far enough.  For example, India&apos;s plans of operations to    meet the contingency of war with Afghanistan have hitherto been treated    as purely the domestic concern of the Government of India.  They have never ,1   been examined or approved by the  Committee of Imperial Defence,  notwith-    standing the fact that they could not be implemented without the consent of    His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.         38.  These questions of bringing the defence problems of  India more :.;  under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and    of the modernisation of the system of higher direction of defence matters in    India raise constitutional and  political issues which we realise are outside    our  province.  There are, however,  important defence implications.   In    particular, we think that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide to make    any  contribution towards the  cost of the defence measures, which the Govern- .  merit of India propose in their letter (Annex No. 1), a closer co-ordination    with and control of India defence should be an  integral  feature of  any new    &apos; contract&apos;  which  may be made.  In this connection the Chief of  the Air    Staff is  of opinion that the Royal  Air Force in  India,  in view  of the    responsibility and status of that Service, not  only in  relation to Indian    defence  but in Imperial defence generally,  can no longer be  treated as an    ancillary to the Army in India. We therefore submit that  these aspects of    the problem should be included in the orbit of the further enquiry which we    assume will have to be instituted as the result of this report.&quot;    51.  The Chatfield Committee express the above conception in the following terms (see paragraph 73 of their  Report) :          &quot; .  . .  . The more completely the defence planning  of the two Govern- ,   ments can be co-ordinated and merged in the general  War Plans, the less will    be the need for defining in  any general  formula the degree of obligation    resting on the Government of India.&apos;&apos; arid in paragraph  76 they make the following specific recommendation : -         &quot; .  . .  . We  recommend that any plans  for  this purpose  proposed    by the two Governments should, as a  matter of course, be the  subject of the    closest consultation between  the defence authorities in India  and the Com-    mittee of Imperial Defence before their approval by the two Governments. &apos;  - We  understand that the Government of India would welcome arrangements    to give effect to this recommendation.&quot;    -52.   We agree with the above recommendation.  As has  already been stated in paragraph 31,  the most recent Indian  War Plan is now under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.  We consider that if  the Commander-in- Chief in India should come to London  for consultation, as has been suggested in
paragraph 32 above, advantage should be  taken of his visit  to  discuss themachinery and methods by which a still closer co-ordination of defence problemsmight be effected.    53.   In the meantime we note with satisfaction that the Government of india are taking steps to set up a body corresponding, so far as Indian conditions admit,to the Committee of  Imperial Defence.                  The Higher Direction of Indian Defence.     54.  In their Report* of July 1938, the Chiefs of Staff  recommended that&quot; the existing system in India for the higher direction of  defence matters shouldbe the subject of detailed examination.&quot;     We gave preliminary consideration  to this matter last summer, and we felt some apprehension that the inclusion of the question of higher direction in theterms of reference of the mission of inquiry to be sent out to India might havemeant  raising  large  constitutional questions, which could  more properly  be examined by a body differently composed.  We came to the conclusion that thequestion was one requiring examination by Ministers, and our intention  was toundertake the examination ourselves.     55.  As a result, the Terms of Reference of the Chatfield Committee did notinstruct them to take this question into consideration, and their Report includesno recommendations on it.     56.  We have not yet had an opportunity of investigating the problem indetail, although the  Secretary of State  for Air has drawn attention  at  one  ofour recent meetings to the necessity and urgency of  such an investigation.   Ifthe Cabinet approve, we are prepared to make this investigation.               Summary of Conclusions and  Recommendations.     57.  The conclusions and recommendations of the present Report may  besummarised as  follows :       (1) We  are in agreement with principal conclusions which  the Chatfield          Committee  have drawn, and with the principal  recommendations          which they have put  forward for the re-organisation of  India&apos;s          Defence Forces; and  we  recommend  the  Cabinet to  accept them          (paragraph 104).    The Principles on which the  Re-organisation Proposals are based.    (2) The first principle on which the re-organisation proposals are based is          that the responsibility for  the Defence of India  rests through  the          Governor-General and the  Secretary  of State for India  with  the          British Government; and that this responsibility will in no respect be          weakened,  whatever political pressure  is  brought to bear  on the          Government of India, either before or after the coming of Federation.          We  recommend  that the Cabinet should  make it clear that there will          be no departure from  this fundamental principle  (paragraph 12).    (3) We also recommend the Cabinet to accept the  second main principle on         &apos; which the Chatfield Committee&apos;s re-organisation proposals are based,          namely, the joint  responsibility of the British and Indian Govern-          ments  for the external Defence of India (paragraphs 13 and l4).    (4) We recommend that an assurance be conveyed to the Government of India          that His Majesty&apos;s Government will support them in any measures          which may become  necessary  in the event of a major political crisis          occurring in India as  a result of  the acceptance of the principle of          joint responsibility (paragraph 14).     *  Paper No. C.O.S. 737, paragraph 50(/c).     f  The references in paragraph 57  are to earlier paragraphs in our present Report.

  (5) We  endorse  the  Chatfield Committee&apos;s  proposal  for  a comprehensive        review of  policy on the Western Frontier, but, pending the receipt of        a report from the Governor-General,  which is  expected  at an early        date,  we can make no detailed recommendations as to how,  and by        whom, this review should be undertaken  (paragraphs 15 to  19).  The Military Aspects of the Proposals.      The Army in India.  (6) We  submit for approval the detailed recommendations of the Chiefs of        Staff  in connection with the Chatfield Committee&apos;s proposals  for the        strength  and  distribution of  the Army  in India,  including the        External Defence Troops (paragraphs 23 to 26).  (7) We  submit for approval the detailed recommendations of the Chiefs of        Staff  with regard  to  the British and Indian units declared  surplus        under the Chatfield  Cbmmi.ttee&apos;s proposals.  The Cabinet should be        aware (a) that the whole of the British units declared surplus have        left India and have been absorbed into the British establishment, and        (&amp;) that no disbandment of  surplus Indian units will take place for a        further 12 months, the Government of  India having accepted their        upkeep for this period as  a charge on the Indian  Defence  Budget        (paragraphs 27 to 30 and  Annex).      The Royal Air Force in India.  (8) The Chatfield  Committee were unable  to reach  agreement as  to the        strength of the air  forces  which  should be maintained  for  India&apos;s        Local  Defence requirements, and their   financial  appreciation  is        accordingly based on the strength recommended by the Commander-in-        Chief in  India.   The  Chiefs  of Staff  record the opinion   that a        minimum  of two  additional bomber squadrons  is required for Local        Defence purposes, over and above the strength  recommended  by the        Commander-in-Chief.  The additional bomber squadrons  could not  in        any event  be supplied for some time, but we recommend that the Chiefs        of Staff should give further consideration to this  question  in the        course of  their examination of the Indian War Plan (paragraph 31).  (9) As regards the air forces which should be  maintained in respect of the        External Defence commitment, the allocation of two bomber squadrons        recommended  in the  Chatfield  Report is regarded  by the Chiefs  of       . Staff  as not providing sufficiently for the air reinforcements required        for the Middle and Far East.  We consider that the strength of these        reinforcements is a matter which the Secretary of State for Air should        raise in the Committee of Imperial Defence (paragraphs 33 and 34).       The Royal  Indian  Navy; the Coast Defence of India; the  Ordnance          Factories. (10) We  endorse  the recommendations of the Chatfield Committee under the        above headings (paragraph 35).  Finance. (11) Our inquiries confirm the view  of the Chatfield Committee that it will        not be possible to raise any substantial amount of additional  revenue        for Defence purposes in India,  during  the period  of re-equipment        (paragraph 36). (12) Accordingly we see no alternative but to recommend that the capital cost        of the reorganisation proposals, estimated at  34-33 millions, shall        be provided by the Home Exchequer, stipulating at the same time that        any excess over the above figure will  be borne by the Government  of        India.  Conclusion 17 below contains our recommendation on the extent        to which  this Home  Exchequer assistance should be in  the form  of        grant and loan respectively (paragraphs 37 and 38).- (13) As regards maintenance charges, we agree with the Chatfield Committee        in regarding it as axiomatic that, with the help of such reasonable
       contribution as His Majesty&apos;s  Government  may  make  towards the       cost of India&apos;s Defence Forces,  so far as these are satisfying a  joint       responsibility, India should meet the whole maintenance cost of her       forces out of her own resources.  In our view there would be no case       for further  assistance from the Home Exchequer in respect of future       maintenance  charges  resulting from the  present  reorganisation       proposals; we Avould not, however, recommend that any hard  and fast       decision  of  principle should be  taken  at the present time in respect       of maintenance charges arising out of causes not directly connected       with the proposed  reorganisation,  e.g., future improvements in the       conditions of service of British troops in India (paragraphs 39 and 40).(14)  The Government of India have informed us that they are prepared in       future,  on the assumption that the Chatfield Report as a whole is       accepted  by  His  Majesty&apos;s   Government,  to  meet the  ordinary       maintenance charges which will arise  in the event of the  External       Defence troops being employed outside India in an emergency affecting       India&apos;s external security (paragraph 41).(15)  We submit for  approval a proposed order of priority in the supply of war       equipment and reserves, as between the Army at Home and the Army       in India (paragraphs 42 to 44).(16)  We point out that exchange difficulties may occur in respect  of purchases       in America, e.g., of vehicles or machine tools (paragraph 45).(17)  We recommend that one-quarter of the sum of   34 - 33 millions, being       the  estimated capital  cost  of  the  reorganisation  proposals  (see       Conclusion 12), should be advanced as a loan to India from the Home       Exchequer,  the remainder  being a  gift from His  Majesty&apos;s  Govern-       ment.  We  consider  that  interest  on the  loan  should  be  entirely       remitted during the first five years; and that after this period India       should pay the service of the loan (interest and repayments of capital)       out of her current resources (paragraphs 46 and 47). General.     Co-ordination  of Defence between His Majesty&apos;s  Government  and the         Government of India.(18)  We endorse  the recommendations  of the Chatfield  Committee on the       co-ordination of Defence between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the       Government  of  India;  and we note with satisfaction that a  body       corresponding to the Committee of Imperial Defence is  being estab-       lished in India (paragraphs 50 to 53).     The Higher Direction of Indian Defence.(19)  We suggest that we should be authorised to sit again for  the  purpose       of reporting on the higher direction  of  Defence matters in India       (paragraphs 54 to 56).
