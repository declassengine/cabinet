w \J JL(THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP EIS    BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYi^KNMENT ) .COPY No.SECRET.CP. No.143/39                 CABINET.                    INDIA .     Appreciation of the Political Situation, by theGovernment of India, dated 17th June, 19:39.     Circulated for the information of the Cabinet bythe Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situationin India, dated the 17th June,  1939,  issued on theauthority of the Secretary of State for India.          Indian&quot;States.  Gandhi&apos;s intervention in the affairs  of Rajkot has ended as sensationally as it &quot;began.On May 17th  he astonished everyone by issuing a statement in which he renounced the award  of the Chief Justice,explaining that he realised that his action in attempting to put pressure on the Thakore of Rajkot and the ParamountPower by undertaking a fast had been coercive and therefore not in accordance with the principles of non-violence; heapologised to the Viceroy, the Chief Justice of India, theThakore Sahib and Virawala, the Thakore Sahib&apos;s adviser,for the trouble lie had given them; and he appealed to thelast two to appease the people of Rajkot by fulfillingtheir expectations.  The Thakore promptly set up a ReformsCommittee, which held its first meeting on June 10th and,at the same tims, issued a proclamation cancelling allspecial measures taken to combat the civil disobedience movement, restoring fines and confiscated property, andpromising civil libertjr and rights to the people so longas they remained within the law.  Somt light is thrown onGandhi&apos;s motives by his subsequent statements about theTravancore agitation, but from a practical point of view he was probably anxious to extricate himself from a situation which was becoming impossibly difficult and toreturn&apos;to the supervision of Congress domestic affairs,which badly needed his attention.         . In his statement about Travancore issued on the4th of June Gandhi announced that he had advised the suspension of the civil disobedience movement in that State,and in the course of his statement explained the essentialsof what -is generally called his  &quot;new technique1&apos;.  The
                                                     Oi  *7!) suspension of civil disobedience was advised because he wished to avoid popular violence and the brutalisation of human nature ana also to pave the way for an honourableunderstanding with the authorities.  He stated that hewas not likely in the near future to advise mass civil disobedience anywhere-.  Tho  &quot;now light&quot; - the phrase is his own - tells him that he must not weaken in exacting discipline; where his conditions of perfect discipline are fulfilled ho can  see his way to advise civil disobedience, but that civil disobedience will be individual and in terms of non-violence  (ahimsa) far more effective than any mass civil disobedience of the past.-The pitch of immediate demands  in the States should be lowered, if necessary, in order to quicken progress towards the final goal.          It is being remarked that this new technique isnot so very hew after all and that this form ofreasonableness has often been Gandhi&apos;s tactics as apreparation for a fight if the first approach fails.However that may be,his volte-face at Rajkot andTravancore has surprised and indeed alarmed many of hisfaithful followers.   Jawaharlal Rehru in particular hasbeen put in a very difficult position, since just before the announcement of the new revelation he had fulminatedpublicly against the  States and the Political Department,speaking of &quot;this intolerable burden and tyranny&quot; anddeclaring that &quot;there- is no freedom for us or for any one in India so long as an insolent and irresponsible power crushes tho power of  the States&quot;.  He has openly declaredhimself bewildered by Gandhi&apos;s behaviour, though he stillfollows him loyally.          The agitation against Hyderabad, controlled by thetwo powerful Hindu organisations, the Hindu Mahasabha and
the Arya  Samaj, still continues  and  on May 21st the longexpected  riot  between Arya  Samaj volunteers going toHyderabad and  Muslims occurred in  Sholapur.  As a resultof this the Bombay  Government approved of the issue oforders externing Arya Samajist jathas from the districts of Sholapur and Barsi and prohibiting to others the useof these  two towns  as jumping off  places for agitation against Hyderabad State.  The agitation is ostensibly, atany rate,  religious and not political and is receivingconsiderable support from Hindus all over Northern and.Central India.  Muslims are much irritated by it and it ishaving a  bad effect on the relations between the two communities.           On June 1st three persons were sentenced to death, 8  to transportation for life and 5 to sentences of imprisonment in the Bazalgette murder case (AppreciationNo.l of 1939 ).     2.    The  Congress Party. The  last Appreciation, Ho.5brought the story of Congress domestic politics up to theapparently complete victory of the right wing by the resignation of Subhas Bose from the Presidentship and theformation  of a new  Working Committee, the members of whichwere all  of tile true Gandhian faith.  Since then Bosehas been busily engaged in trying  to build up his ForwardBloc.  In reality the struggle is  one between conflictingprinciples and policies, between.ni the right and the left,between the conservative wing of the Congress and theRadicals,  Socialists and Communists, between those who,whatever they may say in public, are in theii  heartsreformists and those who::openly proclaim themselves tobe revolutionaries.   But the left wing elements in congress have neither the leaders nor the financial
                                                        JT*  n*                                                        ty, U 0      V               WMM:M &apos;       Mfyi;.I; 4. support sufficient to make them a really powerful face, if they were to break away from the Congress.  The immediate struggle is, therefore, one for the capture of power within the Congress.  This partly explains why the supporters  of the Forward Bloc are anxious to proclaim that it is a platform within the Congress rather than a separate party. Further, the Communists are unwilling to leave the shelter of the Congress umbrella under which they can pursue their policy of infiltration without attracting much notice;  the Socialists dislike the idea of having the Communist partymerged in their ranks, while Bose as the leader of a &quot;United Front&quot; by no means appeals to everyone.  The way in which things will develop  is at present obscure, but may become clearer, if the suggestion for a conference of representatives of all left wing groups comes to anything. In the meanwhile the All-India Congress Committee have issued a circular warning members of the Congress not to give any support to the Forward Bloc, and both YallabhaiPatel and Jawaharlal &quot;Nehru are using their influence againstBose.          At the Calcutta session of the All-India Congress Committee a Constitution Sub-Committee was appointed for the purpose of suggesting amendments to the Congressconstitution in order to remove corruption and malpractices.This Sub-Committee met in Bombay early in June.  Gandhi,whose particular child the Sub-Committee is, was present as an adviser.   A report has been issued containingnumerous recommendations for tightening up membership andthe election procedure of Congress, but there is nothing to indicate that the threatened &quot;purge&quot; will be carried out.     3.  - Provincial affairs.          Bombay - Mention has already been made of the
Sholapur district on the 21st May.  The total casualties inthe riot and assaults following it,, are reported to havebeen  6&apos; dead and 50 injured.          There is apparently an inclination amongproperty owners in Bombay to refuse to pay the new PropertyTax,  and the Bombay Government have issued a warning thatthe necessary coercive action to prevent this will betaken, if necessary.          There is a certain amount of labour unrest in bombay due to the closing either wholly or partially of several mills and a general reduction in night-shifts;labour suspects that this is a deliberate policy adoptedin order to pave the way for rationalisation of the millindustry and lower wages, and&quot;there are threats of ageneral strike.          Bengal - The chief topic of interest has beenthe Provincial Government &apos;s policy in regard to the communal ratio for recruitment to the Provincial Services.In the middle of&quot;May the Bengal Government prepared anote, which, said, in brief, that the theory of recruitment to the services by open competition was not a sound onewhen  applied to India; and that the doctrine of maximumqualification should be replaced by one of minimumqualification in so far as this was necessary to obtainfor the Muslim community a representation in the servicescommensurate with its population strength in the Province,which is. 55)&amp;. The question was debated with considerable-bitterness in the Press and on the platform, and there hasbeen  discussion about how far the special responsibilityof the Governor for the protection of the legitimate rightsof the minorities is involved.  However on June 12th the bengal Government issued a communique containing their decisions.  The basic percentage of reservation for
                                                      9 P ?y                                                  % 6.Muslims in direct recruitment is to be 50^; 15^ will be reserved tor scheduled classes; nothing is to be reservedfor other minorities, such as Anglo-Indians, but special consideration will be given to their needs.  The decisionobviously represents a compromise between the Muslimand Hindu Members of Government.  The general reaction tothe decision is not yet clear.          United Provinces - The dispute at Lucknow betweenShias and Sunnis, which was mentioned in the lastAppreciation, still continues.  Shias have been courtingarrest by openly disobeying the orders of Government, and up to date about IE,000 have been arrested.  The efforts of influential Muslim leaders to arrange a compromisehave so far met with no success, and it is noticeablethat the Muslim League seems powerless to stop this dispute among those who are professedly its members.  Thedispute has naturally led to clashes and two people havebeen killed and several injured.          The Employments Tax Bill, which was mentioned inAppreciation No.3, was passed by the Legislative Councilon May 22nd with only one amendment which it is expectedthat the Assembly will accept.          In the two largest cities in the Punjab, Lahoreand Amritsar, there have recently been strikes of thesweepers, on who in depend almost entirely the sanitaryarrangements, both public and private.  The pretext wasa protest against a byelaw;. but it is fairly clear thatthe sweepers were encouraged both by Communists and also by the regular Opposition to the present. Punjab Ministry.The strikes have now been called off on an undertakingbeing given that reasonable grievances would be investigated.          Assam - The Digboi strike continues without muchprospect of early settlement, though the position at
                                                       9 p a                                                       hi w oDigboi itself appears to be more satisfactory, in that alarge number of new workers have been recruited;, and thereis reason to believe that the old workers would be glad toreturn.  The Congress High Command has intervened and hasbeen discussing the situation with the Assam Governmentand the management of the Oil Company.          Sind - The Cm Mandli agitation was mentioned inAppreciation No.4.  The Tribunal set up to investigate theinstitution reached the conclusion that it was a hotbed ofimmorality.  On May 18th the Government after accepting the findings of the Tribunal banned the Cm Mandli under ,the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908.     4.   The question whether India should co-operate in awar in which Great Britain was engaged has been regularlydiscussed in the Press and on public platforms for some time.Under the present Constitution the Central Government has thepower on the promulgation of a proclamation that anemergency caused by war has arisen, to legislate on matters which are ordinarily matters which fall within theprovincial field.  An amendment of the Government of india act is at present before Parliament, which seeks to give theCentral Government power in an emergency to take executive action also on matters within the provincial field in time ofwar.  The proposed amendment has caused an outcry that therights, of Provincial Governments are being invaded; but it isnow becoming clear thet the passing of the amendment will notbe made the excuse for creating a crisis, and the inclinationis to wait and see what use the Central Government makes ofits new powers; in other words, the Congress will deal withthe situation on its merits as need arises.  There aredifferences of opinion about the attitude which India should adopt towards a war in which the Empire is involved.  Sir
Sikander Hyat, .as was mentioned in the last Appreciation,has given a lead to the Muslims and there is little doubtthat this will he followed, at any rate, in Northern India.Speeches and writings by Congressmen exhibit widedifferences of view;  some take the line that Great Britain&apos;                                                            Idifficulty should be India&apos;s opportunity and that theCongress should take the opportunity, of striking a bargain                                                            ifor further political advance as the condition of giving any help;  others, including apparently Jawaharlal Nehru,though avowing their detestation of the policy of thedictators, profess to be unable to bring themselves toassist in any war in which the defence of &quot;BritishImperialism&quot; is involved.  It seems fairly certain thatthe active and official support of Congress will be withheld unless in some way or other it can be represented that India is participating in war by her own free will.At the same time, it is evident that there is a- growingrealisation of the threat to India&apos;s safety which a general war would cause, particularly if Japan were an active enemy.One result of this is the growing interest in the plans forair-raid precautions, which are being prepared in placeswhich are liable to attack, such as Calcutta, Bombay andKarachi.     5-  Palestine - His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s scheme forPalestine was published in the 3rd week of May.    the muslim press in general rejects the  plan and demands fullacceptance of the Arab demands.    Here the Press goesconsiderably beyond the views of thinking Muslims who aregenerally inclined to consider that  the Arabs have been treated fairly and that the plan should open the way to a                                       settlement./
                                                       9 7 &quot;)                                                       h) 0 &apos;J                                                   9.settlement.   The Congress press, which is not reallyinterested, is inclined to take the opportunity of attackingBritish Imperialism and throwing doubt on Britain&apos;s honestyof purpose.   But the tendency is visible even in theCongress press to recognise that the plan is an honestattempt to solve an intractable problem and, whilesympathising with the Jev/s, to recommend to the Arabs that what has been offered is worthy of acceptance.   On thewhole, the attitude of the Press, while highly critical,is not, except for Muslim papers, unfair or perverse.     6.  Waziristan - The situation in Waziristan hasshown some signs of improvement.   The blockaded sectionsof the Tori Khel Wazirs have made their submission andpromised to give no assistance to the hostiles in future.They have also brought in tenlddnapped Hindus, and theblockade imposed upon them has been raised.   There havebeen several cases of sniping in North 7/aziristan carriedout by small gangs.    In one of these, one British officer and five other British. Ranks were wounded.   There havebeen fewer raids in the Settled Districts.
