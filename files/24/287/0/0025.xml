THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Copy NoP.142.(59).CABINET.HONG KONG,PROPOSED COMPULSORY SERVICE ORDINANCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State        for the Colonies.     1.   The Governor of Hong Kong, with the strong support of the Naval Commander -in Chief and the GeneralOfficer Commanding and the unanimous approval of theExecutive Council of the.Colony, is anxious to enact assoon as possible legislation providing for the applicationof compulsory service to all male British subjects betweenthe ages of 18 and 55 ordinarily resident in the Colony whoare medically fit.  It is intended, however, to call up under the measure only British subjects of European descentWith the exception of men in certain &quot;key&quot; employment,persons so called up would be allocated either to naval,military, or air service or to other essential non-combr.bandefence duties.     2-.   The actual provisions of the bill are being examined in detail, and it is not necessary to troublemy colleagues with them.  But the proposal tointroduce in time of peace compulsory service as contemplated in Hong Kong represents a new departurein
91  *)k) vf &apos;,J                 in our colonial policy,  since  although there  is                 a measure of  compulsory  service  in Kenya (under                 the Kenya Defence Force  Ordinance)  that is  strictly                 related to the  maintenance of  internal security  only                 The measure proposed in  Hong Kong is,  of course,                 concerned with  the  defence of  the Colony against                 external attack.    The volunteer forces in  Hong Kong                 are substantial and efficient:  &quot;but the local                 situation is  such  that  adequate  preparations  to                 meet an emergency require the  most complete                 arrangement for the training and allocation of all                 available British  man power in the Golony.    I have-                 ascertained that the Admiralty and the War  Office                 strongly support the proposed  measure  as being, a                 most -welcome  step towards strengthening the defence                 dispositions  in Hong Kong. -                      3.    The Foreign Office have alsc been                 consulted and consider  that no objection exists  to                 the promulgation of this measure in the present                 circumstances.  of the Far East.                      4.    I would  therefore propose,  subject to  th                 concurrence of  my colleagues,  to authorize  the                 enactment of  this  measure in Hong Kong without deIU.y                                                  M.M.lonial  Office,     26th June,  1939.
