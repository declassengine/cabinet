MILITARY TRAINING ACT, 1939.  DRAFT ORDER TO BE MADE UNDER SECTION II OF THE ACT.                Explanatory Memorandum.  This  draft  Order,  which  is  laid  before  Parliament inpursuance  of  Section  11  (3) of the  Military  Training  Act,1939,  deals with  certain  consequential  matters  which it  is expedient to provide for by reason of the passing of that  Act,and  modifies certain enactments relating to those  matters.   its provisions  relate to militiamen, to men entered  in  the naval reserve  Force or in  the Air  Force Reserve or Auxiliary AirForce, and also to persons registered as Conscientious Objectorswho are undergoing  six months&apos;  training in accordance  with section 3 (8)  of the Act.  It should be understood, therefore,that all the explanations in the succeeding paragraphs of thismemorandum apply to  all  these  classes  of men  although for convenience militiamen  only  are  mentioned.  It is not possible in advance  of experience to make an  esti-mate of the cost  to  the Exchequer or  to  local  rates of thematters dealt with by the Order.  Article 1 gives protection to the militiaman in regard to cer-tain civil liabilities which he may not be able to fulfil by reasonof his removal from civil life.  The Article prohibits the enforce-ment without the leave of the  Court of any judgments or ordersfor        (1) the recovery of possession of any premises of which     the  militiaman was in occupation at  the commencement     of the training;       (2). the payment of rent or  money due under  a mortgage     of such premises; or       (3) the payment of any  sum of money or the enforce-     ment of any security arising out of  an - obligation entered     into before the 1st  July, 1939,  by  a person who subse-     quently comes under training.  The Article applies not  only  to  the  liabilities  of personsactually undergoing training,  but  also to  the liabilities of other persons, such as guarantors who  may become liable owing  tothe inability of the militiaman to  meet the payments becomingdue.   It also  protects the  militiaman from  the seizure of any property (e.g. goods obtained on  hire purchase) in the exerciseof any right arising by reason of  his failure to fulfil an obliga-tion entered into before 15th June,  1939.  If the militiaman whencalled up was sharing a home with some person dependent ofihim, that person is protected from being turned out of the homewithout the leave of the Court.3152
  The protection afforded by this Article extends throughoutthe period of training and for six months thereafter.  Article 2 deals with cases where hardship may be occasionedbecause owing to the calling up of the militiaman  some personmay become unable to  meet his  obligations.  It empowers theCourt to stay execution oh certain judgments or orders, to grantinjunctions or interdicts restraining the exercise of any remedyand to stay bankruptcy and winding up petitions.  Article 3 relieves a militiaman  of liability to pay instalmentsto a building society during his period of training and extendscorrespondingly  the period during which such instalments mustbe paid.  Articles 4, 5 and 6 preserve the superannuation rights of LocalAuthority staffs including teachers.  They provide  that the em-ployee&apos;s absence during the period of training shall not in anyway prejudice the  rights that he would otherwise have enjoyedunder the code of superannuation applicable  to his case.   Nosuperannuation contributions will be required from the  employeeduring the period  of training.  The power is  given to the em-ploying Authority to pay the employers and employees contribu-tions except in the case of teachers where there is no occasion forsuch power.  These provisions are applied also to certain other classes of persons mentioned in the Schedule to the Order includ-ing those who, though not employees of  Local Authorities&apos;, areentitled to similar superannuation rights.  Article  7  similarly preserves the superannuation  rights  ofpolice constables and professional firemen  and exempts them during training from deductions  from pay  for superannuationpurposes.  Article 8 deals with superannuation schemes of employees ofprivate undertakings. Paragraph (1)  provides that the trusteesand other persons  who  administer any such scheme shall take any steps they think necessary to secure that a person called up  shall continue  to be  entitled  to benefits under the schemeto the same extent as nearly as may  be as  if he had not been called up, subject  to any adjustments consequential  upon thenon-payment  of contributions  during the period  of training.Paragraph (2) enables employers  to pay contributions to super-annuation schemes during the period of training in the  caseof persons no longer in their employ.  Articles 9  and 10. The purpose of these provisions is tosecure that militiamen  who  are insured persons under  theNational Health Insurance. Acts immediately before their train-ing commences, will be insured during training  for national health Insurance and Contributory Pensions purposes, and thatmilitiamen who  before  training  are not  insured for National
Health Insurance but are insured for any of the pensions pro-vided under the  Contributory  Pensions Acts will continue tobe insured for those pensions during training.  As a result thesemen will be placed on termination of training in the same posi-tion in respect of insurance as if they had  remained in their employment throughout the period of training.  ,,,    t  Article II provides for continuing in unemployment insurancemilitiamen who are ordinarily within the unemployment insur-ance scheme.  This will be effected by means of the payment ofcontributions  during  training and the  crediting of  a total of30  contributions in the case of persons who complete the fullperiod of training.  In  the  case of persons normally employedin agriculture the contributions will be treated as agriculturalcontributions.  Article 12 provides that in respect of the period  of trainingmilitiamen shall not  be required to pay any part of  the  con-tributions under the  National  Health  Insurance, contributory pensions or Unemployment Insurance  Schemes.  Article 13 will permit the billeting of militiamen (and theirhorses and vehicles) to  the  same extent as if an Order author-ising the issue of billeting requisitions had  been made by HisMajesty under Section 108A of the Army Act.  Article 14 will permit the issue of requisitions for the provi-sion  (either&apos;for  hire or for purchase) of  vehicles,  animals,vessels, food, forage, and stores required in consequence of thetraining  of  militiamen, to the same  extent  as if His Majestyhad made an Order under Section 115 of the Army Act,  and asif the Army Reserve had been called out by Proclamation.  .  Article 15 provides  that a  constable on probation whose periodof probation is interrupted by military training  shall  have hisperiod of probation  extended  accordingly.  Article 16 provides for the prolongation of the  period forwhich a  scholarship, bursary or similar award is held where thetraining  interrupts  or postpones the holder&apos;s course of  study,and the  completion of the course is thereby delayed.  Article 17. The Local Government  Acts  contain provisionssecuring that where owing  to adjustments of local government areas, or for similar reasons, the office of a local governmentofficer or servant is  abolished  or his emoluments diminished,his interests are  protected  by transfer to a new office  or bypecuniary compensation.  The object of this Article is  to secure that for the  purposesof  these enactments  and any orders or schemes incorporatingthem the period during which a man is under training is to count as if it were a  period of local  government service  and asif he had been in receipt of his ordinary civil emoluments.    3152                                               A 2
  Article 18. The Electricity Supply Acts, 1882 to 1936, con-tain provisions of a similar character compensating officers orservants of authorised undertakings or of railway companies towhom the Central Electricity Board give  a direct supply of elec-tricity who suffer loss or relinquishment of employment, diminution-tion of remuneration or deterioration of conditions of service byreason of the happening of certain events,  e.g., the transfer of the authorised undertaking.  The object of the Article is  similar to that of Article 17.  Articles 19 and 20. Under the general scheme of administra-tion the  Registrars-General  in Great  Britain have been chargedwith the  function of compiling successive registers of each annualclass of militiamen.  The material will be mainly provided by the public records inthe custody of the Registrars-General.  Necessary provision is,however, made for returns  of certain exempt persons of whomparticulars are not otherwise available.  The Registrars-Generalare therefore empowered to obtain the assistance of local registra-tion officers in the compilation of the Register, so far as this maybe needed.  In order that men who are uncertain of their precise age maynot be put  to  expense  in establishing their position under theAct, provision  is made for the issue to the person concerned ofa special form of birth certificate without  charge.  Articles 21 and 22 are formal.  The Schedule applies the  provisions of  Article 4 (which dealswith the  superannuation rights of Local  Government Staffs) tocertain officers  not in the direct employment of a local authority.

RESERVE  AND  AUXILIARY FORGES ACT, 1939.   DRAFT ORDER TO BE MADE UNDER SECTION 4 OF THE ACT.                Explanatory Memorandum..  This  draft  Order,  which  is  laid  before  Parliament inpursuance of section 4 (3) of the Reserve and Auxiliary  forces act, 1939, deals with certain consequential matters which it is expedient to provide for by reason of the  passing of that Act,and modifies certain enactments relating to those matters.  its provisions relate to reservists and  territorials.  It is not possible in advance of experience to make an estimateof the cost to the Exchequer or to local rates of the matters dealtwith by  the Order.  Article 1 gives protection to  the reservist  and territorial  inregard to certain civil liabilities which he  may not be able  to fulfil by reason of  his removal from civil life.   The Article pro-hibits the enforcement without  the leave of the Court  of anyjudgments or. orders  for     (1)  the recovery of possession of any premises of which the           reservist or territorial was in occupation immediately           before he was  called out;    (2)  the payment of rent or money due  under a mortgage of           such  premises;  or    (3)  the payment of any sum  of money or the enforcement           of any  security arising out of an obligation entered           into before he was  called out.  The Article  applies not only  to  the liabilities of  personsactually  called out, but also to the liabilities of other persons,such  as guarantors  who  may become  liable  owing  to the inability of the reservist or territorial to  meet the  paymentsbecoming due.  It also protects the reservist or territorial fromthe seizure of any property (e.g., goods obtained on hire pur-chase) in the exercise of  any right  arising  by reason of hisfailure to fulfil  an obligation entered into before being called out.  If the reservist or territorial when called out was sharinga  home  with, some person dependent  on  him, that person isprotected from being turned out of the home without the leave of the Court.  The protection afforded by this Article extends throughout theperiod of service and for a period  of like duration thereafter.  Article 2 deals with  cases where hardship may be occasionedbecause  owing to  the  calling out  of  the reservist or territorialsome person may become unable to meet his  obligations.  It    3151                                                A
empowers the Court to stay.execution on certain judgments ororders, to grant injunctions or interdicts restraining the exerciseof any remedy and to stay bankruptcy and winding up petitions.  Article 3 relieves a reservist or territorial  of Hability to payinstalments to  a  building society during his period of serviceand extends correspondingly  the  period during  which suchinstalments must be paid.  Articles 4 to  8 deal with the civil remuneration of Clerks ofthe Peace, Coroners, Justices&apos; Clerks, constables, employees oflocal - authorities and certain  other  officers who are called out.The position  of Clerks of the Peace of boroughs, Coroners andJustices&apos; Clerks is in each case that they are deemed to be absenton leave and continue to receive their salary.  In each of thesecases also the officer is required to appoint and pay out of hisown pocket for the services of a deputy so far as may he neces-sary but the  authority concerned is empowered to recoup him for the amounts paid to his deputy.  Local authorities and certain other authorities, as set out in the table to Article 7, are alsoempowered to pay to an officer who is called out the differencebetween his service pay and allowances and his civil remunera-tion.  In  the case of these officers there is no question of theofficer having to  appoint and  pay a deputy.  Article 9 provides that for purposes of superannuation rights,any period for which a  Coroner is called out for service shallbe deemed to be service as a  Coroner.  Articles 10, 11 and 12 preserve the superannuation rights ofLocal Authority  staffs including teachers.  They  provide thatthe employee&apos;s absence  during the period of service shall notin any way prejudice the rights  that he would otherwise haveenjoyed  under the  code of  superannuation applicable to his case. No superannuation contributions will be required fromthe employee during the period of service if he  is absent  on leave without pay.  The power is given to the employing Autho-rity to pay the employers and employees contributions exceptin the case of teachers where there is no  occasion fOr  suchpower.   If he  is absent On leave  with pay  the normal super-annuation contributions will be paid both by the employee andby the employing Authority.   These provisions are applied alsoto certain other classes of persons mentioned in the Schedule tothe Order including those who, though not employees of LocalAuthorities, are entitled to similar  superannuation rights.   Article  13 similarly preserves the superannuation rights ofpolice constables and professional firemen during any periodof. service.  If the military, pay  of the constable or fireman issupplemented under the provisions of Article 7 he is liable forthe rateable deductions which would have been made from his
pay if he had continued actually  to  serve  as  a constable  orfireman.  Article 14 deals with superannuation schemes of employees of private  undertakings.    Paragraph (1)  provides  that  the trustees and other persons who administer any such scheme shall take any steps they  think  necessary  to; secure  that  a  personcalled  out shall continue to be entitled to benefits under  thescheme to the  same extent as nearly as may be as if he had notbeen called out, subject to any adjustments consequential uponthe non-payment of contributions during the period of service.Paragraph (2) enables employers to pay contributions to super-annuation schemes during the period  of service in  the  case ofpersons no longer in their employ.  Article 15 provides that in the  case of  constables belongingto the reserve  forces the provisions of the Order in Council shallapply in lieu of the provisions of the Police Reservists  (Allow-ances) Act, 1914.  Article 16 provides that any expenses incurred by  a probationcommittee in making up the salaries of probation officers called out for service and in making contributions to the superannua-tion fund in  respect of such officers  shall be deemed  for thepurposes of sections 5 and 9 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1925,and section 6 of the Probation of Offenders  (Scotland) Act, 1931,to be expenses in respect of the salaries of probation officers.The effect of  this provision is that these  expenses, like other expenses of probation committees, will be  defrayed  out  of localfunds  but will rank for  the  Exchequer  grant in respect of probation expenditure.  Articles ij and 18 make the necessary adaptations in  the Orderin so far as they relate to  Scotland and Northern Ireland respec-tively.  Article 19 is formal.  Article 20 will permit the billeting of army reservists  and terri-torials (and  their horses and vehicles), called  up for  service under the Reserve and Auxiliary  Forces Act,  and members ofthe Auxiliary  Territorial Service employed with such troops, tothe same extent as if an Order authorising the issue of billetingrequisitions had been made by His Majesty under Section 108Aof the Army Act.  Article 21 will permit the issue of requisitions for the provision (either for hire or for purchase)  of vehicles, animals,  vessels,food, forage  and  stores required in consequence of the calling out of army  reservists  and territorials under the Reserve  and auxiliary Forces Act, to the same extent as if His Majesty  had
tmtimade an Order under Section 115  of the Army Act, and as ifthe Army Reserve had been called  out by Proclamation.  Article 22  applies in relation to  the Air Force  as Article 20applies in relation to the Army.  Article 23  applies in relation to  the Air Force  as Article 21applies in relation to the Army.  However,  under  Section 115of the Air Force Act and under this Article, aircraft  may be impressed in addition to  vehicles, animals, vessels, food, forageand stores.  Article 24. This  Article is directed to the same objects asArticles 20  and  23, but  is different in form because  navalbilleting is carried out under a different  statutory authority tothat of the Army and Air Force.  The Article- amends the  operation of the Naval  Billeting Act,in respect of forces called out under the Reserve and auxiliary forces Act, by dispensing  with the  proclamation and AdmiraltyOrder.  (The old procedure is not however abolished.)   TheArticle also substitutes the term &quot; requisition of impressment &quot;for &quot; requisition of emergency &quot; and confers on the Navy, whenforces are called out under the Reserve  and Auxiliary forces act, the power to billet vehicles, which  was conferred on theother Services by the Army and Air Force Annual Act,  1939.  Article 25 is formal.  Article 26 deals with the payment of contributions under the contributory Pensions Acts and provides that men called out for service  who  were previously insured for pensions  only  shall continue to  be  insured  during service  to  the  same extent as  they  are insured before service.   It is  not  necessary todeal with either Health Insurance or Unemployment Insurancesince in the case  of reservists and territorials both these matters are covered by the existing Acts.  Article 27 provides that a constable on probation whose periodof probation is interrupted by his Service shall have his periodof probation extended  accordingly.  Article 28 provides for the prolongation of the period  of whicha scholarship, bursary or similar award is held where the Serviceinterrupts or postpones  the holder&apos;s course of study,  and thecompletion of the course is thereby delayed.   Article  29. The  Local  Government Acts contain provisionssecuring that where owing to adjustments of local  government areas, or for similar reasons, the  office of a local  governmentofficer or servant is abolished or his emoluments diminished, hisinterests are protected by transfer to a new office or by pecuniarycompensation.
  The object of this Article is to secure that for the purposes ofthese  enactments and any orders or  schemes incorporating itthe period during which  a man is called out for  service is to count as if it were a period of local government service and as ifhe had been in receipt of his ordinary civil emoluments.  Article 30. The Electricity Supply Acts, 1882 to  1936, con-tain provisions of a similar  character compensating officers orservants of authorised undertakings or of railway companies towhom the Central Electricity Board give a  direct supply ofelectricity who suffer loss or relinquishment of employment,diminution of  remuneration or  deterioration  of conditions ofservice by reason of  the happening of certain events, e.g.,  thetransfer of the authorised undertaking.  The object  of  the  Article is similar  to  that  of Article  29.The Article  also  contains  provisions  for  its  application to northern  Ireland.  Articles 31, and 32 are formal.  The First Schedule  applies the provisions of Article 10  (which deals   with  the  superannuation rights  of Local  GovernmentStaffs) to certain  officers not in the direct employment of a LocalGovernment authority.  The Second Schedule deals with certain matters  relating toconstables and firemen which are consequential on the provisionsof Article 13.3151

 [Corrected copy in  substitution for copy presented Wednesday, 14th    June,  1939.]            MILITARY TRAINING ACT, 1939,                            and   RESERVE AND  AUXILIARY FORCES ACT, 1939.DRAFT ORDER TO  BE MADE UNDER  SECTIONS 11         AND 4 OF THE ACTS RESPECTIVELY.                EXPLANATORY- MEMORANDUM. .  Articles 1 and 2 deal with policies of industrial and ordinarylife assurance  and assurances effected with friendly societies.The main purpose of these Articles is to secure  that no forfeitureof any benefit under such assurances will be incurred by reasonof the  non-payment by a person required to  undergo training under the Military Training Act, 1939, or called out for service under the Reserve and Auxiliary  Forces  Act,  1939 (or by hisdependent wife or  child), of any premium which becomes pay-able during any &apos;&apos;  period of relief &apos;&apos; which is a period consistingof,  or related  to, the  person&apos;s training or service.  The person from whom the premiums are due is  also given an- additionalperiod of  grace in  which to pay up arrears which have accruedduring his period of relief.  No interest will run on such arrearsuntil after the termination of the period of grace.  In the event of a claim arising under any ordinary or friendlysociety&apos;s assurance during the period of relief or  during theperiod of grace, the  amount assured  will be  reduced by theamount of arrears  of  premiums remaining unpaid.  On  a claimarising  after the period of grace,  the  amount assured will bereduced by the amount of arrears with interest.  In the case of an industrial whole life  assurance, if a  claimarises during the period of relief or during the period of grace,the amount assured will, as in the case of ordinary policies, bereduced by the amount of arrears of premiums; but in the caseof industrial whole life assurances, when a claim arises  afterthe period of  grace, the arrears will be written off by reducingthe sum assured by an  amount varying with the age of the lifeassured.  In the  case of  industrial endowment policies no  deductionwill be made  in respect of premiums unpaid during the periodof relief, on death occurring at any time.  The date of maturityof these policies will  be postponed by a period equal to thatfor which the  premiums which became due during the period of relief were unpaid.
  It is provided that when the total period of relief amounts to fifteen months, no additional period of relief shall be allowedexcept in respect of any subsequent periods of training or service.  The Articles apply generally to  policies effected before 15thJune, 1939. It is provided, however, that in the case of policieseffected on or after that  date which have been in force for ayear, no forfeiture of any benefit shall be incurred by reason ofthe non-payment  of any premium payable during  the periodof training or service.   Here  too a period of grace is given, inwhich to pay up arrears of premiums.  The Articles do not apply  to any ordinary insurance policyif in the year in which the premium is payable more than twenty-five pounds is payable by way of premiums under the policy.  Article  1 also deals with the question of  notices before for-forfeiture served in  respect  of  industrial policies,  and providesthat any such notice which either relates to premiums accruingduring a period of relief or is served during, or within 28 days before the beginning of, a period of relief, shall be of no effect.Such a notice, however, will become effective if, within the twomonths following the period of relief, the person from whom thepremiums are due does not, by making or tendering a payment in respect of premiums, or otherwise, evince a desire to continuethe policy.  Article  3. This  Article  lays down rules for ascertaining the periods of relief and periods of grace referred to above.  Article  4 enables an employer to treat persons required to undergo training  or called out for service, employed by himimmediately before their training or service, as continuing in his employer for the purpose of the payment of  contributions under any life insurance scheme  in  force  in  respect of  hisemployees.  Articles 5 and 6 are formal.

            MILITARY TRAINING ACT  1939                            and     RESERVE AND AUXILIARY FORCES ACT 1939Provision of monetary assistance to persons liable to training or    service, in respect of dependants and certain other financial    obligations.  Provision for monetary assistance in respect of dependants andcertain other financial obligations is not dealt with in the orders in Council laid before Parliament under the above mentionedActs.  The purpose of this paper is  to set  out briefly what isproposed in regard  to  these  matters.  These proposals are applicable to peace-time conditions and are not to be taken  toapply in the event of war.A. Allowances for families and dependants.  1. A married man undergoing a course of six months&apos; trainingin accordance with the Military  Training Act 1939 will be eligiblefor family allowance in respect of his wife and children at thesame rates and under the same general conditions as a regularsoldier not above the rank of sergeant, except that the allotmentfrom his pay (additional to the  family allowance) will be 3S. 6d.a  week.  A married  man  called  out under the Reserve and auxiliary Forces Act  1939 is  eligible for family allowance  inrespect of his wife and children at  the same rates and under thesame general  conditions as a  regular soldier serving with theColours, but without restriction as  to his age.   The  weeklyallotment from pay in the case of a  man called out under theReserve and Auxiliary Forces  Act 1939 ranges from 7S. to 28S.a week according to his rank,  etc.  The weekly rates of family allowance are 17S.  for  a wife,5S. for the first child,  3S. for the second child, 2S. for the thirdchild, and is. each for any further  children.    The rates for children are  subject to  review in the light of cost of livingfigures.   (For ranks  above sergeant,  the  rate  for a  wife is increased up to a maximum of 23S. 6d. a week.)  2. A  man undergoing a course of six months&apos; training  inaccordance with the Military Training Act 1939 to whom family allowance  is not being  paid may be  granted during  the sixmonths&apos; initial training  dependants&apos;  allowance in respect  of agrandparent, parent, brother or sister towards  whose supporthe has for a period of not less than six months been contributingan average net sum of more than 3s.  6d. a week, if in the  lightof the circumstances  of  the household, it  can be reasonablyassumed that the withdrawal of the man&apos;s normal contribution would make an appreciable difference to the household economy
amounting to hardship.  In general, households will be regardedas coming within this category where the income after paymentof rent is less than 15s. a head, children of compulsory schoolage counting as half.  Where this condition is satisfied an allow-ance, normally at 7s., 12s. or 17s. a week (towards which theman will be required to contribute 3s. 6d. a week) will be paidaccording to the amount that the man has been in the habit ofcontributing  during the  previous  six months.  Thus  if,  after deducting something for the cost of his own keep which is being put at a  very low  figure  of 5s.  a week the man  has  beenpaying more than  15s.  a week, the allowance will usually be17s.   If  he  has been contributing  something over QS. but notexceeding 15s. a week the allowance will usually be 12s.  If hehas been contributing more than 3s. 6d. and not more than gs.,the allowance will usually be 7s.  These allowances will in allcases  include  the  man&apos;s own allotment of 3s. 6d.  The totalallowance issuable  will  in no case be  one which  would bringthe household income after payment of rent up to more than18s. 6d.  a head, or 23s. 6d. where there  is only one  person.Special treatment  will  be  accorded in  cases  in which thedependant is a widowed mother or other person who is livingalone  and is and has been solely dependent on  the man.   In sucha case the allowance will normally be  20s. 6d. (including theman&apos;s allotment).B. Military Service (Special Allowances) Advisory Committee.  The First Lord  of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State forWar,  the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of  labour are appointing a Committee to be known as the Military Service(Special  Allowances) Advisory Committee to consider applica-tions  for special monetary assistance from  those who, notwith-standing the special protection afforded by the Orders in council made  under the two Acts and any normal allowances which maybe granted for families and dependants, are unable, by reasonof undergoing a course of six months&apos;  training in accordancewith the Military  Training Act, 1939,  or  by reason of being called out for service under the Reserve and Auxiliary forces act,  1939, to meet their financial  obligations, whereby serioushardship is  caused.  The circumstances in  which assistance may be given and thegeneral rules governing the grant of assistance are as follows:    (1)  Assistance may be granted to those  who    (a) are  undergoing  a  course  of six months&apos; training as          required by the Military Training  Act,  1939, or are          called out for service under the Reserve and Auxiliary          Forces Act, 1939;  and    (6) are  unable by reason of their service to meet their finan-          cial obligations,  whereby serious hardship is caused.
