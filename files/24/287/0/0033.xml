Duchy of Lancaster.                    I desire  to  obtain the  approval of ray colleagues            for  the.preparation of a Bill  with the following objects                    (1)  To  transfer the responsibility for the                          Food (Defence Plans) Department from                          the President of the Board of Trade                          to another Minister.                    (2)  To provide that Minister with certain                          statutory powers over and above those at                          present available  to him under the                          Essential Commodities Reserves Act.                    The problem  is an urgent  one which has hitherto            been delayed by  the pressure on  Parliamentary time, and  I            v/ould propose, if my colleagues  agree, to introduce the            Bill before the  House rises, so  that it may be considered            immediately the  House reassembles after the Summer Recess.-            mR^SJPERSiqSJ^  MINISTERIAL -RESPONSIBILITY&apos;.            2.      On 6th April last, the  Prime Minister announced in            the  House of Commons  that he  proposed to make arrangements            whereby the responsibility for the Food (Defence Plans)            Department should be transferred from tto President of the            Board of Trade to  another Minister and that I had agreed            to take over this responsibility.   It was contemplated            at that time that  formal provisions for this transference            of responsibility might be included in the Civil Defence Bill            but  on further4 examination, it was considered undesirable            to complicate that  Bill &quot;by the introduction, especially            during the Committee or Report stages, of clauses relating            to Food Supply.    Consideration  was also given to the            possibility of  including the necessary provisions in the
Development Bill.   It did not appear practicable,however, so to extend the scope of either of these measures,3.     It is desirable that the transference of ministerial responsibility should be regularised at theearliest opportunity.   The existing arrangements underwhich the Board of Trade retains the statutory responsibility&quot;under the Essential Commodities Reserves Act and accountingresponsibility for the Vote of the Pood (Defence Plans)Department, cannot be considered satisfactory.   Moreover,until the position of the Minister responsible for PoodDefence has been regularised, he cannot be nominated as thecompetent author it^r In the draft Defence Regulations or inthe Orders made thereunder for the purposes of food control in time of emergency,ADDITIONAL STATUTORY POWERS.4.     I also consider that the Minister responsiblefor food Defence should, as an urgent defence measure,be provided with certain statutory powers over and above those at present available under the Essential CommoditiesReserves Act, and I propose, subject to the concurrence of my colleagues, to table  the opportunity provided bythe necessity fov regularising this transference of ministerial responsibility to ask Parliament for these powers.5,     The primary purpose of that Act, which waspassed in July,1938, was to implement the policy of creating reserves of essential commodities in the country.The Act enables the Department to acquire and storestocks of essential foodstuffs and do all such things,including the erection of buildings, as may be necessary
for the storage,  preservation and. transport of such stocks.It also enables the Department to make payments to tradersfor the purpose of inducing them to increase, their stocks orto improve their storage facilities.6,     The additional powers which I now propose to obtain by legislation are required, for the following purposes:-       (l) For the further improvement of the existing             facilities for the storage of foodstuffs.       (2) For the maintenance of cold storage accommodation             in suitable centres.       (3) For the erection and extension of plant for the             hydrogenation of edible oils.Improvement of storage facilities,,7.     Very large stocks of essential foodstuffs are normally stored in port areas.  The practice of holding thegreater proportion of certain stocks in such areas, and thetendency for processing industries to concentrate there also,have increased in recent times, owing to the consequentialeconomies in transport costs.  The present situation in thismatter gives cause for considerable anxiety, both on accountof the risk of actual damage to stocks through air bombardment,and also on account of the difficulties likely to be experienced in moving stocks during periods of sustainedattacks on these centres.  London presents the main problem in this connection.  Its public warehouse accommodationrepresents more than one-third of such accommodation in thecountry as a whole, and the warehouses are situated cheifly the neighbourhood of the docks,8.     Plans have already been prepared on a voluntary basis for the dispersal in time of emergency of stocks ofcertain essential foodstuffs from the London port area.
 These plans relate  to part of  the stocks of meat, butter and tea, and plans  for  other foodstuffs, particularly canned foods,  are being discussed with  the  trades.  These plans do not, however,  extent to wheat and sugar, as the processing industries for these  commodities are also situated in Port areas.  The execution  of plans of this kind at the beginning of an emergency would, however, throw a heavy burden on transport facilities at a critical period  and might be interrupted by hostile action.  The Department are therefore discussing with traders schemes,  relating particularly  to the Metropolitan area, for the dispersal of commercial stocks of essential foodstuffs in peace time.  These schemes would involve Government assistance towards  the acquisition and main- tenance of the alternative storage accommodation, and possibly compensation of any extra charges in connection with distribution falling on the trades concerned. 9.     Consideration is also being given to the availability of storage accommodation in suitable centres for the reception of foodstuffs forwarded from  the -ports in time of war.Maintenance of cold storage accommodation,                                             35 10,    Both the Committee of Imperial Defence  and thePrime Minister&apos;s Advisory Panel of Industrialists have recently given attention to the question of cold storage accommodation in war-time.   The total cold storage capacity was substantially increased during the Great War and has hitherto been more than sufficient for peace-time requirements.   about 50 per cent, of the existing capacity for frozen meat is, however, situated in London, and certain public cold stores in  the Provinces, which are large units and therefore the most useful for war-time     Si  C.I.D. 553rd Meeting,  Conclusion 1.
requirements, have recently been closed down.   Goldstorage requirements will increase in the aggregate intime of war, and will also arise in the Provinces,including the West Coast ports.11.    It is essential that sufficient accommodationshould be available to meet the situation likely to arise in war, including the diversion of shipping.   TheDepartment have carried out a detailed survey and are now working out schemes to meet the estimated war-time requirements.Erection of Processing Plant.12.    Powers are also required to enable the Departmentto increase the capacity of, the plant in the country forthe hydrogenation of edible oils.   An expansion of theconsumption of margarine must be anticipated in time ofwar, particularly owing to a reduction of supplies of butter.   A comparison of estimated requirements and available manufacturing capacity shows a substantialdeficiency in hydrogenation plant.   It is proposed togive assistance to traders for certain extensions of theirfactories and also to erect a Government factory for usein time of war.SUMMARY OF ADDITIONAL POWERS REQUIRED.13.    The above paragraphs explain the purposes forwhich additional powers are urgently required.   Iconsider however that the proposed Bill should be drawn in somewhat wider terms to meet anticipated future needs,and I therefore ask that it should provide for thefollowing additional powers:-       (a) to enable the Department to provide facilities           for the storage of foodstuffs.   The present           Act does not enable the Department to provide
                                               ti  y    storage facilities directly except  for the    reserve stocks Y/hich they acquire;(b) to enable the&apos;Department to give  assistance to    traders towards the improvement of  storage    facilities,,    The present Act enables the    Department to give assistance to traders towards    the improvement of the facilities for the storage    -of stocks as augmented under the  powers in the    Actc    The application of the powers in the Act    to the improvement of the storage facilities  of    traders for existing commercial stocks is not    free  from doubtj(c) to enable compensation to be paid to traders    for extra charges incurred as a result of    dispersal of stocks;(d) to enable cold storage accommodation to be    maintained or provided, sufficient  to meet the    situation likely to arise in time of war.(e) to increase the capacity of processing plant  for    foodstuffs in the country, either by the erection    of Government plant or the extension of    commercial plant, as necessary to meet    requirements in time of war.
