THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  June 1939.SECEET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 130  (39).CABINET.GERMAN-POLISH DISPUTE  OVER DANZIG.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a record of two  interesting conversations between Sir Charles Mendl, Press Attache at  His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Paris,and Count Welczek, the German Ambassador in Paris.    Count Welczek is not a Nazi, but, like most Germans of his class, has aninbred dislike of and contempt for the Polish- race.  This circumstance, togetherwith the resentment of all German nationalists at the separation of East Prussiafrom Germany, naturally colours his view of the present German-Polish dispute.    Information received from other sources tends  to  confirm Count Welczek&apos;sconfident prediction that there will be a lull of a month or two, but there is no particular  reason to suppose that he is  informed of  Herr  Hitler&apos;s plans and intentions.  The German Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and still more Germandiplomatic representatives abroad, are often kept in ignorance in regard to theconduct of German foreign policy.  But for what they may  be worth I thoughtmy colleagues might perhaps be interested to see the records.                                                                      H.    Foreign Office,        June 3, 1939.CONVERSATION BETWEEN SIR C. MENDL AND  COUNT WELCZEK ON MAY 18,  1939.    LAST night I met the German Ambassador at dinner and had over half an hour&apos;s talk with him.  I gave him a personal message from Lord Tyrrell, who had asked me, if  I  got an opportunity, to tell him in his name that the feeling inEngland, especially in the north, was so irritated that Mr. Chamberlain had touse his influence to keep the pressure in hand not to finish all the embetements wewere having,  and that, if there was any further aggression, in Lord Tyrrell&apos;opinion it would be impossible to hold public opinion back.    Count Welczek said that he knew this, and that it confirmed what everyonewho came from England said.  What was more, Hitler and the people round himknew it, and  the only man who still held out and adhered to his previous wrongopinion was Ribbentrop.  The Fiihrer now saw the reports, or practically all thereports, of the  German Ambassador in  London.  In Count Welczek&apos;s opinion.Hitler wanted to avoid war,  and, in anj&apos; circumstances, there would be no warbefore the  harvest, and not then provided some solution could be found for theDanzig problem.    On this subject he said he was rather dismayed.  Two months ago, before theBritish guarantee,  there was no question of Danzig  being vital to Poland&apos;sexistence  (I  said that  I  always understood that they had  said so  before this guarantee, but he cavilled at  this and said that they had always treated Danzig       10414   [19363]
on a different footing from the question of the Corridor).  He said that he wasa part Pole and knew the people well;  they were the most headstrong and recklesspeople in Europe, and were quite capable of precipitating a European war overDanzig, which, he repeated again and again, was only a question of prestige,    Talking most earnestly, the German Ambassador said  it was essential thatGreat Britain should take the matter up with Poland,  as she cared far morewhat we said than what France said,  though, of course, joint pressure would be best.  He felt sure that  Hitler would meet the Poles in any safeguard regardingthe use of the port  and the non-fortification of it, and would want only a stripof the Corridor (he talked of 1 kilom. instead of the 25 generally mentioned).He would like, he said, to talk to M. Daiadier, but he had had strict instructionsnot to begin  any advances.to the President du Conseil.  He was going to try to talk, however, to M. Bonnet before the latter went to Geneva, to urge the dangerof leaving the decision in the hands of  the most fiery people in Europe.  He hopedmost earnestly that  Lord Halifax would bring pressure to bear on Colonel  Beck.We had nearly three months,  but, unless something was done  before August to convince Beck and. Ridz-Smigly that they  must meet the Germans over thisquestion, there would, he feared, be a collision, with the consequent catastropheof a European war.    Count Welczek said  that the  Germans had given the Poles  Teschen andanother large German town, and this  was the  reward they  got: when the  Polesthought they had a good guarantee,  they were stiffer than they had ever dreamedof being before.  Beck would like to meet the Germans, but pro-German thoughXjount Welczek believes him to be, he feared that he was now the prisoner of his public opinion &quot; chauffe a blanc.&quot;   Danzig was and always would be a Germantown not even Ridz-Smigly denied this- and there would be no real peace until this was settled.    He said  there was a war party here headed by M.  Campinchi, and he wasnot sure that M. Daiadier who was in some respects more  like a Prussian thana Frenchman was not coquetting with it.  He found M. Bonnet much easier todeal with, and felt when negotiating with him that he was  working with a man who would go to the utmost limit to avoid a European war up to the last moment.He regretted, therefore, that foreign affairs were so much more in  the hands ofM; Daiadier than M. Bonnet, as  he found him hard to deal  with. He reiteratedseveral times that absolution must be found for Danzig, but once that was settledbe  bought peace was in sight for many years.   &apos; I had the impression that Count Welczek was saying genuinely  what he felt.He kept repeating that he had only one son left the other, it will be remembered,committed suicide because he did not see eye to eye with Nazi  methods and he wished, above all things, to avoid war  : it was a crime that this should be riskedover a question of prestige, and he said to me : &apos;&apos; Without wishing to be offensive,may I  say that it seems incredible that His Majesty&apos;s Government  should havegiven the arbitration of what constituted a casus belli into the hands of the mostheadstrong and unbalanced people in Europe.&quot;                                                    CHARLES  MENDL.    May 19, 1939, CONVERSATION BETWEEN SIR C. MENDL AND COUNT WELCZEK ON MAY 21, 1939.    I HAD another talk to the German Ambassador last night after dinner, andreverting to our conversation of the other day, he again said that-except foruntoward incidents there would be no war before the harvest, at any rate.  Hethen went on : &quot; I do not say that I believe all I am going to tell you now, and I know that the Germans made  a great mistake in the Great War when they were con-vinced that submarines would defeat the British fleet.  But the people nearest theFiihrer hold that war with Poland would be over in  a  few days,  long beforeEngland and France  would probably have moved,  by which time we, who wouldnot  have bombed either  Paris  or London, would have  regained the  Germanfrontiers of 1914.   Germany would then turn to England and France and say shewas prepared to guarantee peace for a long time.  I know you would not believeour word after what happened in Czecho-Slovakia, but the Fiihrer  really believes
i o Jthat he acted in good faith, he having been told of imminent risings  owing toforeign intrigues in the interor of Czechei and Moravia chiefly American-Jewishmoney.&quot;     Count Welczek then said at which I openly, scoffed that  if we did not accept peace then, Hitler&apos;s entourage were convinced, and had convinced  him, thattheir air force could destroy the British fleet.  They had adopted from the Italiansthe idea of a  suicide corps pilots who would take  two bombs and swoop on to ships.  They would necessarily be killed, but would do terrible damage to the fleet.This was an old idea, as he said, adopted from the Italians.  He  doubted  if theItalians would have  really carried this out; he felt sure the Germans would.  Hesaid : &quot; I know you don&apos;t believe this possible, and I don&apos;t say I believe  it either,but that is the mentality of the Fiihrer&apos;s chief advisers at the present moment, andit is this mentality which is  the chief danger of war.  I am not telling you this for propaganda and, I repeat, there are many who do not share  this  view, but those to whom the Fuhrer listens believe it firmly and sincerely.&quot;     The Ambassador again  said how difficult  it was to do anything here when one knew that the man one was talking to was not listened to by M. Daladier, andthat, much though he preferred M. Bonnet, he would  sooner M.  Daladier took over foreign affairs.                                                     CHARLES  MENDL.     May 22, 1939.
