Appreciation of the political Situation,  by the Government of India, dated 17th May,  1939.      Circulated for the information of the  Cabinet  by the Secretary of State for India.
                                                       0 DConfidential appreciation of the Political situationin India? dated the 17th May, 1939s issued on the   authority of the Secretary of State for India.      The  Congress  Party.    On April  29th Subhas Bose  resigned the  office  of  President  of  the  Indian National Congress. Exactly three  months before, he had  been re-elected to  that office, standing in defiance of the  wishes of Gandhi  and  the Working Committee.   They have  now taken their revenge.   The first  step  towards it was the resignation of the Working Committee in February  :  then the All-India Congress Committee, meeting at  Tripuri for its  annual session early in March, passed a  resolution which in effect  censured the President and  required him to accept  Gandhi 1s  dictation in the  choice of a new  Working Committee.   Gandhi refused to comply  with Bose&apos;s desire  for a Committee which  would contain a few of Bose&apos;s followers : Bose  must either  reappoint the previous members or  go  his  own way,  appoint a Committee entirely of his  own choosing, and take  the  consequences.   Thus faced with a dilemma between surrender and avowed rejection of Gandhi&apos;s  support, Bose announced his resignation to the special session of the All-India Congress Committee which met at Calcutta on April  29th.   In  his place Rajendra Prasad, the most trusted  moderate of the Gandhian school, was immediately, and with doubtful legality, elected President : and. a new Forking Committee, was announced which contains twelve of the old  members,  with the addition of two Gandhian Bengalis in  place  of the Bose brothers.     Thus the victory of  the right wing is in appearance complete.    The annoyance of the unruly elements in the party was-shown in scenes of disorder and  threatened violence both at Tripuri and at Calcutta.    In more sober sections  there isprobably greater dissatisfaction than has yet been declared. The &quot;Fascism&quot; of the High Commend has given still further                                     provocation :/
 provocation :  and  Gandhi&apos;s  dominance  is no  longer unquestione Bose  has  now formed a  rival party  (the &quot;Forward Bloc&quot;) within the Congress :  its programme is  to be revolutionary,  including all anti-Imperialist,  radical and  progressive  groups  - such as the  labour  and  peasant organisations - and  in particular will  combat the &quot;constitutionalist1&apos; mentality  of the  High Command by preparing the  country for  conflict  with  authority, both  in British India  and in the States.    The Forward Bloc may start with the impetus  of a  growing body  of left  wing opinion : but  hitherto no leadership  has succeeded  in combining the  various elements of the  left,  and it may be doubted whether Subhas  Bose is the man to conduct a &quot;successful revolt  against the experience and determination of the &quot;&quot;old  guard&quot;.   2*  Indian States.    In Rajkot Mr.  Gandhi has failed to turn  to account the award given  in his favour  by the  Chief Justice of India on April 3rd.   Having made to various communities promises which  proved  incompatible with a literal fulfilment of  the  award if  the local  Congress  party was to have  a  majority on the  reforms committee, he not only failed to make any progress towards the constitution  of the  reforms committee but  even earned for himself an imputation of bad faith : he  left the State on April 23rd to  deal with  the party affairs  in Calcutta and has  now returned to Rajkot  to continue  negotiations which do not at present  hold  out much promise of  success  on the lines  desired by  him.   3-  The  only  other State  in which British Indian  elements are at present  causing  serious inconvenience is Hyderabad. In the first appreciation of  this  year it was  mentioned that the Congress agitation  in this State  had been  suspended :but the  iirya Samaj  and  Hindu Mahasabha,  both frankly  communal organisations,  have continued to send parties  of volunteers                                                   into/
                                                       U S                                                      3.into  the  State  to  disobey  the  law.   Some thousands  of these,recruited in various  parts of  India and mostly assembledwithin  the  limits  of  Bombay and  the Central  provinces whichadjoin  the  Nizam&apos;s territory,  have been arrested  in  the State.  ho  The Bombay Provincial branch of  the Muslim  League hasheld  a  session  which  is  of some  importance for various reasons.Sholapur  was deliberately  chosen for the meeting  as  being thecentre  in the Province  of  the  Hindu agitation againstHyderabad.    Both  Mr. Jinnah and Sir Sikandar Hyat Khan werepresent,  the latter coming from  the Punjab to preside over the session and (it is supposed) to  give the League guidance more practical and acceptable than  the- negative policy which Jinnahhas lately  prescribed.   It was  feared that  the session mightoccasion  a  clash between Muslims and Hindus,  but  this wasavoided.    The  only point  on which the Congress at Calcuttaand Muslims at  Sholapur appear to agree is condemnation of thetreatment of Indians  in Africa.   On most other topics theresolutions of  the League  have expressed disapproval of the actions of  the  Congress party  and Congress Ministries.   It is interesting to  compare the attitude of the two sessions towardsthe threat  of war.    The Congress resolution on the  subjectreflects  some change  in public opinion in recent  months :there is  undoubtedly  a growing dislike of the dictators and a growing sympathy with the  aims of Great Britain : whereas theTripuri session professed  to regard British  foreign  policy asin secret league with the  aggressors and wholly despicable,the Calcutta resolution hints  that the cooperation of India ina war might  be  obtained by winning the consent of the indian people,    (The  greater part  of the resolution expressesdisapproval  of  a clause in the Bill now before parliament which seeks  to  render more  effective the provisions  of theGovernment  of India Act conferring on  the Central Government                                                  powers/
powers in time  of war.  This clause the Congress misrepresentsas striking at  the basis of provincial autonomy and creating&quot;a war dictatorship&quot; in India.)     The Muslim.resolution merely requested the executivecouncil of the  League to give Indian Muslims a lead as to thepolicy to be followed in a world war;  but Sir Sikandar, in moving it, made no secret of his own opinions  : unlike theCongress, the League has something of moment to say on this issue since it  has the Muslims and the Punjab behind it, andthese provide most of the Indian Army  : in the next warIndia&apos;s own liberty may be deeply involved : and India shouldnot hesitate to fight on the side of freedom against the aggression of the dictatorships.     Mr. Jinnah at Sholapur uttered his usual denunciation ofthe conspiracy  of the Congress with the British Government tointroduce the federal scheme.   Sir Sikandar also stated his conviction, based on the experience of the last two years,that the official scheme had ceased to be suitable  : but hisfive &quot;basic conditions&quot; for an acceptable scheme appear toreduce the Central Government to a shadow.  5.   Provincial administration has proceeded for the mostpart quietly.    The main threat to public order comes as usual from communal strife : at Vellore in Madras and Gaya inBihar there has been loss of life in rioting between Hindusand Muslims :  at Lucknow in the United Provinces a dispute of long standing between Shias and Sunnis has imperilled thepeace on several occasions,  and the Provincial Government havenow been driven to impose on the city a large punitive police force which is  to be paid for by members of the two factions.                                                     in/
     In Assam a strike has been in progress since April 2ndin the important oil fields at Digboi  : on the 18th a small body of Assam Rifles had to open fire  on a violent crowd,killing three persons and wounding four.   The Strike (which still continues without any prospect of early settlement) has attracted a good deal of attention in  some of the European-owned newspapers on account, of action  of the Ministry whichhas been represented as impeding recruitment by themanagement of outside labour to replace the strikers.   As the domestic labour employed by officers of the Company has taken part in the strike, much inconvenience has been caused totheir families.  6.  Central Legislature.   It was mentioned in the lastAppreciation that the attitude of the  Muslim League party inthe Assembly resulted in the defeat of the Government motion for approval of the Indo-3ritish trade agreement.   The Billembodying the terms of the agreement was similarly defeated :it was then &quot;certified&quot;, and passed by the Council of State.  7.  Waziristan.     Political control in Vaziristan passedfrom the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, NorthernCommand, to His Excellency the Governor, North west frontier province, on the 10th April.   The Faqir of Ipi left Inzarwariin the middle of April, and is now reported to be at Gorwekhtjust on the Indian side of the Durand  Line.   The Madda KhelWazirs made their final submission on  the 12th April and air operations against them ceased.   Hostiles have been active insniping and committing other minor offences, but no seriousengagement has taken place.  There have been further raids inthe Settled Districts and more Hindus  have been kidnapped.The blockade of the Ahmadzai Sazirs of Bannu tribal area waslifted on the 17th April on their reaffirming undertakingsrecently given with regard to the outlaw Mehr Dil.
