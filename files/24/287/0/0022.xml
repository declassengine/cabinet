                                                        k tJ &apos;i     DRAFT  STATEMENT .QIT LOFG-TERM  MILK POLICY, TO 3B MADE       Off SEOOKD READING OE INTERIM MILK  I INDUSTRY BILL.           The  Government in this  Bill are asking Parliament to authorise  substantial  Exchequer assistance  for the purpose of encouraging the continuation  of the  improvement in the quality of  the milk supply which is already  in progress.   They regard this quality improvement as an essential feature of a sound- national milk  policy directed towards achieving that  increased consumption of milk which is  so desirable,  not only in order to  put the  financial structure of the milk  industry in this country permanently on a sound basis, but also from the point of  view of  public health.   I wish to make  it quite clear, however, that  such an  increase can in the Government&apos;s view be achieved only  if, concurrently with this improvement in quality, there  are improvements In methods and organisation, particularly on  the  distributive side, leading to a reduction in costs.   The objective of permanent milk policy must be a self-supportingmilk industry, subject only to appropriate safeguards toprevent the price structure being undermined by low prices of competing milk products  from overseas.   In pursuance of that end, the Government is continuing to seek a means of approach to problems, some of which raise acute controversial issues.          It has been suggested that the Government should initiate an expert inquiry into the costs of distribution.   Itmust be remembered that  a good deal of information derived from various sources is already available as to costs of distributionof milk and the Government do not propose in the present Bill,which  is essentially an  interim measure, to ask for special powers to undertake a further enquiry.   If, however,  inconnection with the further examination of the whole problem which  is being undertaken, it is found necessary to add to our knowledge on this subject, the Government will take thenecessary steps to this  end.
