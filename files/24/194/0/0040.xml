This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.Hy colleagues will remember that it was largely at my suggestion that the matter of the proposed Merger between the Marooni Companies, the Cable Companies and His Majesty1b Government (CP. 126(20)) should be referred to a Cabinet Committee.This Committee has met, and has had the advantage of a clear Report from Sir Otto Niemeyer and Sir VTilliam McLintock. We have also had the advantage   of reading a large number of other documents, which were ciroulated to the Committee.I regret that I find myself in opposition to the views of my colleagues on that Committee.   I desire to ask cry colleagues of the Cabinet to consider very carefully, even at the last moment, the general and political aspects of the case before giving their assent to the proposed Merger.In the first instance v/e are faoed with a Merger of the llarconi and Cable Companies with a capital of upwards of  50,000,000, of which 59,000,000    is admittedly fictitious, and in my view several further millions are of doubtful validity.The control of this Company must remain with the share-holders, and the shareholders will presumably re-elect the present Directors, which would involve a monopoly of the telegraphic communications of the Empire in the hands of a financial Group who, to say the least, have not a high reputation.The proposal put before you by our advisers, Sir Otto and his oolleagues, is that we should hand over to such a Company the Beam Wireless installations, inoluding ali future improvementsSECRET.CABINET.CP. 140(28)Committee on Policy with regard to Competition between Beam Wireless and Cable Companies.MEMORANDUM BY THE HOME SECRETARY.
and dioooveries, and In fact the future economic possibilities of Beam Telegraphy, either by sale or on rental.The value of the Government installations and capital is insignificant - something under half a million.   The profits brought in are  150,000 a year, and the real value to the nation  is that by means of this factor we are able to exercise a moderating Influence on the vagaries of the two purely commercial concerns, who propose to amalgamate for the sole object -to put it plainly - of making more money out of the general public.Vfhat is the reason why the Government is approached in this matter?The answer is that the Cables are feeling the competition of liarconi to such an extent that they might become bankrupt, or go into liquidation, thus removing a great Imperie.1 asset in the event of War.    That is the sole reason why we are approached.Let it be remembered that only a short time ago the Cable Companies were prepared to enter into a pooling arrangement with ourselves and apparently to set the Harconi Company at defiance.We are told that unity of control will involve economies. I am prepared to admit that it will involve higher profits, but I am not satisfied that the control should be exercised by the Marconi Group.What we want, being representatives of the general public, is not higher profits for a speculative group, but lower rates for our telegrams.   V/e have no real interest in the success or otherwise of the competing groups.   The Herger, if it is to be effective, must be a complete monopoly.    It would be ridiculous to suppose that the Post Office should lease the Beam system to the Combine, reserving a right to license any other group or company to start Beam services in competition with the Combine; and though the Postmaster General is very averse from leasing the future telephonic improvements, or even disooveries, I cannot myself see how you can divorce Beam Telephony from Beam Telegraphy.
V/e are told by the representatives of the Dominions Cable Conference now sitting that the Dominions have a very strong feeling that we should go into this Merger, and give up our Bean; but at the same time it is curious to note that there is a distinct disinclination on their part to put their own Beam services into the Merger.    In other words, as so often happens, it is the Mother Country who is to pay the piper, while the Dominions want to call the tune.Then we are told that the Marconi Company will not continue their present Merger with the Gable Companies unless we come in. Let us examine this.   They have announced a Merger though it is true that they have said that it will be subject to our coming in.   But the Prime Minister has denied, in the House of Commons, that v/e have arrived at any conclusion, or are in any way bound. Still the financial ramp has gone on upon the Stock Excha-nge, by which the holders of Marconi shares - whoever they -were, must have made a considerable fortune.I have been engaged   before I was a Minister, in various commercial undertakings, and seen various amalgamations.    I have never known one in -which a party to the proposed negotiations has entered into it, submitting tamely to his competitors, and said:    &quot;Make your terms; I am willing to come in&quot;.    It is an attitude which in the business world would be scoffed at.   How can Marconi withdraw from their present combination, and see their shares go headlong down?   V/e have got the whip hand, though our advisers, I admit, do not seem to think so.Let me take a further point.    The proposed payment to the Government is to be in the form of a royalty on all communications arriving or terminating in the British Empire, whether Beam or Cable.   This will for all time be pointed to as a block on the reduction of rates.   Marconi would say in a year&apos;s time - &quot;V/e should be delighted to reduce rates to Australia or Canada, but we oannot afford it with the dead weight of the Government royalty on every word -we carry&quot; .   They would tell their
shareholders that they could pay a bigger dividend - but for the Government royalty.Sir Otto Hiemeyer stated that his object is reduction of rates.   I can see no advantage in a Company containing nine millions of water, upon which dividends, and high dividends, will have to be paid, if as speculative covmters these nine million shares are to be of any value.   V/e should have no control, except a possible appeal to the Railway and canal Coamission.   V/ho is to appeal - the individual trader, or the Government?   The moment the Government appeals, we should get the same reply about our royalties.   And if the individual cable user proposes to appeal, he will find it a somewhat expensive amusement to fight a combine with a capital of  50,000,000.I do not go further into details, because I am totally-opposed to selling or leasing the one Government asset which is capable of infinite development, and which constitutes the best safeguard against undue exploitation of the Public by either Llarconi or Cable concerns.I believe political repercussions of this proposal would be serious and unpleasant.    I need not refer to the previous political scandals connected with the llarconi Company: but I am satisfied that in a year or two&apos;s time, when our majority may perhaps be lower than it is to-day, and when troubles begin between the Combine and the Public, we should have grave difficulty in justifying the action which my colleagues propose to take at the present moment.    I therefore regretfully submit this memorandum to the Cabinet, and ask that my most definite objection - not on detail so much as on principle may be fully recorded.V/. J. H,
