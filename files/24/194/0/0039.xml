this ixdcuu^t us-the propjsrty of his britt^ic fciajssty&apos; o ck)visl^rtt. i. cabin3t.139. mtioml library of scotland - new buildings,llsliorajdul;; by the secretary of stats for scotland,Aa my colleagues are aware, the establishment of the national library of scotland was facilitated by the gift of  100,000 by sir alexander grant to constitute an endowment fund, the interest from which very largely covers the cost of the maintenance of the library.i now wish to bring before the cabinet for their consideration a further offer of  100,000, which has been made by sir alexander grant with a view to the provision of new buildings for the library on the site of the present sheriff court house. information with regard to the offer will be found in the memore.ndum by the library trustees, which is attached to this memoraiidum together with a copy of a letter from the lord president of the court of session.the necessity for new buildings for the library was recognised at the time of the passing or the national library of scotland act, 1925, in which; it was provided that the faculty of advocates should make part of their premises available &quot;pending the provision of premises for the permanent acoomjaodation of the library&quot; and that &quot;when premises for the permanent aocomnodation of the library havo been provided&quot;, the foregoing provision should cease to have effect and the existing premises as reconstructed, extended and adapted should be allocated between the faculty and the board of worts.from this it will be seen that the utilization of an adjacent site was in view, and it was contemplated that the present site of the sheriff court house would ultimately be required.     mb ether suitable site has been suggested, and it has to be kept in view that, apart from the requirements of the library, there is a long-standing need for improvement and extension of the sheriff court house buildings.    a scheme is at present under consideration for the erection of new government buildings on the site of the calton jail in jedinburgh and as indicated in the attached memorandum the erection of new sheriff court buildings as part of this scheme is in view.the office of works have had an opportunity of seeing the trustees1 memorandum and point out that the estimates of cost as regards the construction both of the sheriff court buildings and the new library buildings cannot be regarded as authoritative at the present stage.     in particular they have Borne doubt whether  78,000 will cover the cost of the former.    the time required for the completion of the buildings may also be slightly under-estimated.the attitude of the sheriff court house commissioners towards the proposal to remove the court house and with respect to their contribution towards the cost of removal has not been ascertained, but i hope that it will not be unfavourable.    itwould/
would not, howewr. bo safe to assume that the Court House (Joaais sinners would &quot;he prepared to pay much more than 50% of the cost, (say  20,000) of imptv\ring the Sheriff Court House buildings on the preaqut aite as their contribution towards a new building scheme.In considering the financial commitments involved 1 should like my colleagues to bear in mind that, thanks to Sir Alexander Grant1s original gift, the National Library of Scotland has hitherto cost the State very little in comparison with other institutions of the kind.    The Estimates for 1928 provide for a grant-in-aid to the National Library of Wales of .U.7.000 and a special grant of over  3,000 towards the cost of buildings and equipment, while the total nett cost of the National Library of Scotland (including allied services) as provided for in the Estimates, is a little over  2,000. Apart from this aspect of the matter it seems beyond question that, if Sir Alexanders present offer were refused, no scheme could be devised for providing the necessary accommodation for the Library at less cost to the State than the scheme now proposed.I may add that, while the question of providing new accommodation for inter alia the National Library has beenunder consideration by the Royal Commission on Museums and Galleries, it is not expected that the Commission will report for some considerable time and. as the Lord President indicate^,, an early decision with regard to Sir Alexander Grants offer is most desirable.I have no hesitation in expressing my view that this most generous offer should be accepted, and I nope that the Cabinet will authorize me-to proceed at once with the necessary negotiations on the understanding that the best possible terms will be arranged with the Sheriff Court House Commissioners.&apos;JQHM GILM0UR\Scottish Office,Whitehall, S.W. 1.27th April, 1928.
1,     Sinoo tho institution of tho National Library in 1925 the iistees have had boforo them the need for the provision of more [table accommodation for the Library, and have from tine to time fen in communioation on the matter with the appropriate Departments [His Maj0 8ty!s Government,     They now desire to bring the subject Lin under the oonoideration of the Secretary of State, in view of [ fact that owing to the generous offer of a private benefactor it [now possible to provide the neoossary buildings largely from l7ato resources.2.     In 1924, when tho propooal for the establishment of the tonal Library was first under consideration, H.H, Office of Works [pared plans of a building partly on the prosont site and partly [the adjacent site of tho Sheriff Court House, with a frontage to jrge IV Bridge, desired (along with the premises in which the meeting collection of books is now housed) to provide permanent [ennodation for the Library and for the roadcrs who resort to it. Khe opinion of tho Trustees these plans, 3ubjeot to Bono lfications of detail provide for a suitable building.i 3,     The plans have now been so arranged as to admit of thetding being completed in throe parts or stages, namely:- (l) A mainpk faoing Georgo IV Bridge, adjacent to and oommunioating with theLament House, containing tho Reading Room, Exhibition Room, andIrdstrative rooms of the Library, with storage for about 1,197,000pes;    (2) A subsidiary block at tho back of No. (l) providing[tional storago for about 300,000 volumes;    and (3) A further blockriding accommodation for the profossional uso of the Faculty ofloates and for their Law Library.     The Trustees are satisfied that[he first portion alono were carried out tho main needs of therary would be permanently met as regards reading room accommodationInhibition space;    while tho accommodation for book storage,[thor with the relatively small unoxhausted storage in the existing[iaec, would provide accommodation for accessions for the next fifty[3.     The erection of the second portion might be postponed until thojtion of storage accommodation a^ain arises, eay, fifty years hence.[erection of the third portion 1a&quot;.ght bo regarded at proaent as[definitely postponed, as it is understood that tiie Faculty of Advocateshot anxious that their preoent building should be altered.14,     The erection of the first portion involves the removal of the King Sheriff Court House, and this oannot be commenced until febla aooommodation has been provided for the Sheriff Oourt elsewhere. Prusteos are aware that a scheme for the erection of a nevp Sheriff h House on another site has been mooted for Dome time past, and iB resent under consideration by bhe Offioe of work.     The Trustees tdvised that the preliminary arrangements in oonnection with the ffer of tho Sheriff Court Houss to the new site and the ereotion of tew Court House will occupy three or possibly four yoar3 and the ooet Itiaated by the arohiteot of the Office cf Works at  78,000, five of Bite,     It will thus be seen chat tho lapse of threo or [yeara and an expenditure of  78,000 are unavoidable preliminaries 12 commencement of any operations connected with the erection of hv Library buildiivjc.[ *&quot; NATIONAL LIBRARY OF SCOTLAND.ftt April, 1928.Memorandum by the Trustees regarding Library Buildings,
5,     The demolition of the existing Sheriff Court House and tho stion of tho first portion of the Library buildings will occupy se or four years more, and are estimated to oost  178,000, :luoivo of site, say,  200,000 in all.6.     On 28th June, 1927, the Trustees addressed a letter to the :ttish Offico inviting tho consideration of tho Secretary of State tho provision of suitable Library buildings.     Tho chief require-:ts of the Library were indicated and it was otatod that the spaoo book-storage in the oxisting premises would be exhausted in ten twelve years.     If the aocossions increase in voLume as they are present doing the n-torago will be exhausted even oarlior.     These - among the circumstances which mrlre the early settlement of plans r tho new buildingB a matter of urgency.7,     In his reply to the Trustees&apos; lottor the Socrctary of State :rtcd out that it would be appropriate to raise the building &quot;stion beforo the Royal Commission on Museums anc1 Orallorias, tho ;ointment of whioh was announced on 5th July, 1927.     On 28th iiary, 1928, the Library wan visited by a Sub-Committee of the Royal :::.scion, under the chairiianship of tho Hon. Evan Charteris.     The aLtteo wore conducted round the buildings and made a detailed ruction of the premises.     They wero shown the plans of the sting buildings and of the projectod now buildings and they took dence from the Librarian, from Mr..

A detailed Memorandum on requirements of the Library has been furnished to the Commission.3.     TTithin the last fow days the Trustees havo received from a to individual an offer to contribute to the cost of the first :ion of tho new Library building to the extent of  100,000 subject the following conditions:    (l) that tho Government is prepared riily to take in hand, and oomplote tho first portion of tho new lding;    (2) that tho donor&apos;s   contribution shall be paid in talments from time to time as the work prooeods simultaneously lh payments not less in amount to bo provided by Government out of &quot;ic funds;    (3) that the donor is to be the sole private donor ributing to the work;    (4) that the building is erected on the sting site or an adjacent site fronting, and having a public entry-la, George IV Lridgc end communieating directly with the buildings shich the National Library (formerly tho Advocates&apos; Library) is at sent housed;    and (5) that the plans ultimately adopted are approved s,he donor,S.     In view of the new oituation thus created and of the urgent Idrements of the Library the Trustees dosiro to invite the pi deration of the Secretary of State and of the Government to the Iter and respectfully to express the hope that action with regard It may be no longer deferred.pAL LIBRARY,pC-H, 6th April, 1928.
K/ U vJCQpy. BRIGLANDS,RUMBLING BRIDGE, KINROSS-SHIRE.6th April, 1928.Dear Sir John,I am authorised by tho Trustees of the National Library of Scotland -   through th*ir Standing Committoo - to approach you on the subject of the enclosed Memorandum (three copies), and to aok your good offices in bringing it before tho Government, and particularly the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The public-spirited offer to uhich the Memorandum relates is made by Sir Alexondor Grant, tho same generous donor who contri-buted the original endowment fund at the time when the Library was handed over to the Nation.    He has requested that no publication of his new offor should be made in the press until the Trustees aro in a position to accept it;   and I feol sure you will help us in respecting this request.      I have his full authority in com-munieating his name to you and to the Government, and the Memo-randum has been submitted to and approved by him.The importance of his offer, and the urgency of dealing with it, will be obvious from a consideration of the circumstances already known to you and summarised in the Memorandum:   and the Trustees   to whom the problem of increased accomodation of a kind worthy of the national character of the Library is a matter of the most pressing concern, are anxious to be in a position to accept it as soon as possible.    To this   the Government&apos;s assent to the whole undertaking referred to in the Memorandum is   of courset an essential preliminary;   and it is with a view to obtaining that assent&apos;that I am authorised to approach you. Upon such assent being given I anticipate no difficulty in having the sum named in the cfier put under trust for disbursement in accordance with the conditions of paragraph 8 of tho Memorandum, in much the same way as \as done with the original endowment fund.The Chairmen of the Board of Trustees (Sir Herbert Maxwell) and myself along with Mr. Ramsay iiacdonald - who is much interested in this matter - and one or two of the other Trustees will gladly wait upon the Prime ianister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer at any time convenient to them - and to yours&amp;lf. Some of us (myself included) are to give evidonce regarding the Library before the Royal Commission on Museums and Libraries (we have already appeared before that Committeo sitting in Edinburgh) on tho 2Bth or 27th of this month;   and we shall accordingly be in London at that time in any case.I am,Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)   J. A. CLYDE,The Rl., Hon.Sir John Gilmour, Bart., M.P., Scottish Office.
