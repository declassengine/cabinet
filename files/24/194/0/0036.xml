This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.264Printed for the Cabinet, April, 1928.SECRET.- Copy No.CP. 136 (28)THE CABINET.FUTURE BRITISH GARRISONS IN CHINA.I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, regarding future British Garrisons in China.A very early decision is necessary in order to enable the proposed reductions and reliefs to be arranged this year.The War Okkice,2oth April, 1928.L. W.-E.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.1. At its 229th Meeting on 14th July, 1927, the Committee of Imperial Defence 083 adopted the following resolution :  5651&quot; China. The situation in China is so uncertain that no reliable forecast can be made as to how \omr it may be necessary to retain the Shanghai Defence Force hi China. Moreover, it is the intention of the Government to reduce the strength of this force as and when opportunity offers   .   .   .&quot;It is now nearly nine months since this resolution was passed, and the prospect of a termination of the state of civil war which bis lasted so long seems to be as remote as ever. Although no settled form of central Chinese government is in sight, the reductions which we have been able to make since the above resolution was passed have not been followed by any deterioration of our position in China. I am therefore of opinion that the time has come for a fresh review of our military position and liabilities in the Far East, and that we should now define the policy which will guide us in fixing the ultimate strengths at which we must maintain our military garrisons in that part of the globe.2. It will, perhaps, assist the Committee if I recapitulate briefly the events in China of the past year or so. Early in January, 1927, and following on the successful advance to the Yangste of the Cantonese armies, there occurred what is known as the Hankow incident; and, as it appeared to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the safety of our nationals in Shanghai would be endangered should the victorious Nationalist armies advance on that place, a decision was taken on 17th January to send a Defence Force to China. The gravity of the emergency which caused this decision to be taken is best exemplified by quoting from the instructions given to the Commander of the Shanghai Defence Force, which stated that his force was &quot; to protect British lives and property in Shanghai against any Chiuese military forces that may endanger them, and to prevent, by force if necessary, the entry of any Chinese military forces into the International Settlement.&quot; At that time our total garrison consisted of two British aud one Indian infantry battalions divided between Tientsin and Hong Kong, uud it is interesting to recollect that in 1911 it had been considered necessary to maintain no less than six battnlious (British and Indian) for the defence of these two places.The greater portion of the Shaughai Defence Force had reached its destination by the middle of March, when it had its only serious clash with the Chiuese. This incident, however, was caused by an attempt on the part of the defeated and disorganized Northern troops to enter the International Settlement in their efforts to elude their pursuers ; it. cannot be described as an attack by organized Chinese forces, which was the eventuality to meet which British reinforcements had been sent to Shanghai. The occurrence of serious anti-foreign outrages at Nanking on 24th March and the subsequent advance100   4/28   w.o.p.   30:u
northwards of the Nationalist Armies caused His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide on 1st April to send a further brigade of infantry with artillery to the Far East. It was anticipated that this reinforcement might be required at Peking and Tientsin ; but as other nations were now beginning to show a readiness to take a share in the defence of their nationals in North China, and as the Nationalist advance came to a stop before Peking and Tientsin were in danger, these British reinforcements never went beyond Hong Kong, where they landed between the middle and end of May. These troops brought our total forces in China to their maximum of 20 battalions of infantry, together with 2 brigades of artillery and other troops.3. Throughout the past year no formed bodies of Chinese troops have ever shown any inclination to attack places garrisoned by our forces, and it soon became apparent that the main danger which we had, and shall have, to guard itgainst was mob violence. Quite a small show of military force, as our experiences at Shanghai went to prove, was adequate to cope with such situations, and it therefore became evident that we were, over-insured. As anti-foreign demonstrations were not renewed, we have, from time to time, been able to make reductions in our troops, and our garrisons in China stand to-day at the following strengths : At Hong Kong ...      ...      ...      ...   3 British and 1 Indian battalions;the artillery of the fortress.At Shanghai (with detachments at Wei-hai-Wei and Nanking)     ...      ...   1 British battalions ;1 armoured car company;1 field company, R.E. At Tientsin and Peking ......   2 British battalions.In terms of Infantry these figures mean an increase of 7 battalions over and above the 1S)2G garrisons of Hong Kong and Tientsin. I wish, therefore, to explain the conditions under which these reinforcements are now living, to make recommendations for the amelioration of these conditions, to formulate proposals for a further immediate reduction, and also to recommend the policy on which the ultimate minimum strength to be maintained in the Far East should be based.The need for the early definition of a policy is emphasised by the necessity for making timely provision for adequate accommodation for our ultimate garrison, which is closely connected with the cognate subject of the health of the troops.4. By the beginning of the next trooping season all the extra British units mentioned above, with the exception of one battalion at Tientsin (which is in barracks which include married quarters), i.e., 6 battalions, 1 field company, Royal Engineers, and 1 armoured car company, will have been separated from their families for periods ranging from 18 to 21 months. This state of affairs imposes a great hardship on the units, and cannot but have a harmful effect on the individuals concerned. In time of war it is necessary to ask men to accept this hardship ; in time of peace, however, it is unfair to separate men from their families for indefinite periods, and, though the Army has accepted so far the fact that conditions of life at Shanghai have made this separation inevitable, an unnecessary continuance of this state of affairs is bound to lead to unhappiness and not unnatural discontent. On these grounds, therefore, it is necessary to devise means of bringing to an end an avoidable hardship.5. The discomforts of the temporary occupation of Shanghai are further accentuated by the deterioration in health to which the troops are subject. It has recently been found necessary on grounds of health to bring home the 2nd Bn. Coldstream Guards ; but other units, although perhaps in a lesser degree, have suffered as well. Troops in Shanghai are always liable, especially in the summer months, to epidemics of a serious nature, and so long as a unit is kept in such a climate there is always the chance of its succumbing to the attacks of epidemic disease such as cholera, dysentery and malaria, which are always prevalent, and are the three chief potential dangers. The deterioration in the physical efficiency of units stationed in Shanghai is still further accentuated by the impossibility of their carrying out any but the most elementary training.(5. The cumulative effect of all the above disabilities is a distinct loss in the military efficiency of units which are kept too long in Shanghai, and it is, therefore, necessary that all British units which have to be retained in China in the conditions outlined above should, on grounds of contentment, health and efficiency, be relieved every 12 months.The relief of the units specifically mentioned in paragraph 4 above will already be long overdue by the beginning of the next trooping season, and they must certainly be relieved by the end of the current year. This relief will cost over  300,000, and this charge will recur every year so long as the strength of our forces in China remains
imdiminished and their conditions of life unchanged. It must also be realized that these frequent reliefs, absolutely necessary as they are, not only involve great expense to the public but also constitute a considerable financial drain on individuals and on regimental funds, and for that reason they become an additional hardship. It is therefore highly desirable, on grounds of both public and private economy, to reduce our forces, so far as am be done with safety, in order to reduce the number of annual reliefs and their consequent cost.7. I am quite certain that a reduction to our original post-war garrison of three battalions distributed between Hong Kong and Tientsin is impracticable, either now or in the future. These numbers proved insufficient to meet the emergency which faced us in Shanghai at the beginning of 1927, and I have already advocated a permanent increase of at least four battalions to our Far Eastern garrisons (C.I.1). Paper 847-15, paragraphs 3 and 1). I regard this increase as essential, and the cost involved will soon have to be faced, though I do not ptopose to enlarge on this aspect at the moment. In the mean-time, it is obvious that Shanghai itself will require some form of garrison for at least a year to come, and, taking this into account, 1 propose to consider, without prejudice to the question of the strength of the ultimate garrison of China, whether any immediate reduction cannot be made in our existing numbers. The last reduction which brought our forces in Shanghai down to four battalions has not been followed by any deterioration in the local situation, whilst the only danger to be apprehended is still chat, arising from mob violence. We have given proofs of our readiness and ability to deal with such disturbances, and 1 am of opinion that we can safely remove another battalion at once, so long as we maintain a reserve at Hong Kong on which we can draw in emergency. At the same time it does not appear to me to be any longer necessary to maintain as strong a reserve at Hong Kong as we have at present. The situation at Canton seems to be more sfciblc than it was a year ago, and there has recently been a distinct improvement in relations between the Canton Government and that of Hong Kong. The present garrison of four battalions can, therefore, he safely reduced to three. I accordingly recommend a reduction of two infantry battalions, one to be taken from Shanghai and the other from Hong Kong, and I advocate the simultaneous withdrawal of the field company, Royal Engineers, from Shanghai, since this unit is no longer required in the preparation of the defences of the Settlement.   The withdrawal should uke place this summer before July.S. The accommodation which would be set free by the above reductions can be re-appropriated for the use of the married families whom it is proposed to send out with the four battalions which will have to proceed on relief to China during the forthcoming trooping season.9. When the reductions recommended have taken place, the troops will be distributed as follows : Tientsin ...       ...   Two infantry battalions (which would furnish detachments at peking and Wei-hai-wei). Shanghai...       ...   Three battalions and one armoured car company.Hong Kong      ...   Three battalions, plus fortress artillery.Of the Hong Kong battalions, two could be spared in emergency to reinforce the Northern garrisons, should the situation deteriorate to such an extent as to make this necessary.It is for consideration whether we are justified in retaining the armoured car company in Shanghai much longer. The Shanghai Volunteers maintain an armoured car unit with eight cars, which should be capable of dealing with any trouble inside the Settlement. In fact, a reinforcement of this particular arm was not apparently considered necessary when the Shanghai Municipality framed their original estimate of reinforce-ments necessary to deal with mob violence on an extended scale. My only reason for not pressing for the immediate withdrawal of this particular unit, is that I do not wish to suggest too large or too obvious a reduction at any one time.10. I do not propose at this sftige to make any definite recommendation as to the ultimate strength and distribution of our China garrison. 1 consider, however, that our policy should aim at the complete evacuation of Shanghai as soon as such a step is politically feasible. As far as one can foresee at present, it will be inexpedient to remove the troops altogether from Peking and Tientsin, however much the situation there may improve, while we shall have to maintain in Hong Kong a garrison which will be of sufficient strength to enable adequate reinforcements to be sent, in an emergency, to Shanghai or to Tientsin without having recourse to the expensive alternative which was forced upon us last year.
11. I summarize my conclusions as follows : (a) The present system of temporarily increasing the garrisons in China imposesunjustifiable hardships on the troops and on their families, through the enforced and lengthy separation involved. The troops have also suffered a deterioration in health owing to the unhealthy climatic conditions, particularly at Shanghai.(b) These conditions and the lack of training facilities at Shanghai are affectingadversely the efficiency of the units involved.(c) To mitigate these disabilities annual reliefs are, under present conditions, essential.The cost of these reliefs can be minimised pro tanto by a reduction in the Far Eastern garrisons.(d) The situation has now improved to an exteut which permits the further with.drawal of two infantry battalions and the field company, R.E.   These units should be brought away from China before July of this year. (c) This reduction will set free accommodation which can be used to house the families of the relieving units : this will improve the amenities of life of unitstemporarily stationed in China. (/) The reductions recommended will leave eight infantry battalions (including oneIndian battalion) and one armoured air company in China, which garrison is sufficient to deal with any situation which may reasonably be expected to arise in the near future.(y) A.s regards the future permanent garrison of China, we should aim at the evacuation of Shanghai, and the location of sufficient troops in Tientsin and in Hong Kong to obviate the necessity of sending reinforcements from England should another emergeucy arise.
