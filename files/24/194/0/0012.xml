phis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government..printed for the Cabinet.   April 1928.SECRET.Copy No.29CP. 112 (28). Revised.(B.R. 29.)Sir Austen Chamberlain to Sir Esme Howard (Washington).Sir,o. 503.   Secret.)Foreign Of/ice, April 5, 1928.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have, as you are aware, been giving serious consideration for some time past to the question of the future exercise of Belligerent Eights at sea, with particular reference to the capture of private property in time of war. The growth of the United States Navy, the evident determination of a large section of American public opinion that the British Empire must never again be permitted to exercise to the full the rights claimed and put into operation during the Great War, the use which is being made of this circum-stance by the Big-Navy element to inflame American opinion against this country, and, finally, the Knowledge that this question of Belligerent Rights constitutes the only apparent and. indeed, conceivable casus belli between the Empire and the United States, have led to the appointment of a special sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence to examine the whole question and, in particular, to recommend whether or not it would be wise to make an attempt to reach an agree-ment with the United States on this matter.2. The Committee have as yet reached no definite conclusion. There is general agreement that our needs as a belligerent must prevail over our interests as a neutral. It would seem, too. that our position in the world requires us, even in the altered circumstances in which modern warfare and modern commerce are conducted, to maintain as heretofore belligerent rights at as high a level as possible, although some serious arguments can be adduced in favour of the opposite view. But the Committee have, as already stated, not yet reached a final decision on these points still less on the desirability or otherwise of attempting to negotiate an agreement on this subject with the United States.8. A close analysis and comparison of British and American practice in this matter has led to the conclusion that, while there is no great divergence in principle, an agreement, even if otherwise desirable, might be difficult of achievement in regard to the application to the conditions of modern warfare of those principles on which the two countries are agreed. On this point it seems unlikely that the Committee can make much further progress without some more authoritative knowledge than it possesses at present as to the probable disposition of the United States Government towards the idea of an agreement which would take into account the circumstance that the generally recognised practice in the matter of blockade and contraband no longer appears to give adequate effect to the fundamental principles on which that practice was based. Clearly much must depend on the spirit in which this or any future United States Government would be likely to enter upon discussions of this delicate question.4. United States Presidential elections take place in November, and the Republican Convention will be held in June. The Committee realise that if it were thought desirable to take any action in this matter vis-a-vis the present United States Government, such action would have to be taken without delay, and that, otherwise, action will have to be deferred until the autumn of 1929 the earliest date at which the new Administration, entering upon office in March of that year, would be in a. position to discuss any serious questions of foreign policy. His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that certain risks are involved in leaving the question open for some eighteen months longer, since it may be used by hostile elements in the United States in such a way as to embitter the existing public controversy in regard to naval construction and generally to prejudice Ariglo-4375a   [17489]
American relations. Nevertheless, this is the course which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment think it would probably be best to follow, unless there were clear reason to believe that negotiations would lead to an early and satisfactory agreement. There is, however, a further aspect of this matter which requires immediate attention. - 5. It is possible that discussion may be precipitated by events beyond our control, in the lirst place, Senator Borah has introduced into the Senate a resolution urging the importance of re-codifying, by means of an international agreement, &quot; the rules of war governing the conduct of belligerents and neutrals in war at sea.&quot; He suggests that this should be done before the meeting of the Naval Conference of 1931. The second event is a conclusion by the twenty-one States of the Pan-American Union, during the recent conference at Havana, of a Convention on Maritime Neutrality. A first examination of this document has disclosed no departure from the generally recognised principles of international law bearing on the interception of private property at sea. There appears, indeed, at first sight, to be nothing in the Convention which would be inconsistent with the idea of an ultimate agreement on this subject between the Empire and the United States.6. But the importance of these events lies in the proof which they afford that the minds of responsible authorities in the United States may be moving in the direction of a general international settlement of these problems. The possibility of an abrupt and spectacular summoning by the United States Government of an international conference on the whole question of Belligerent Rights is, unfortunately, too much in keeping with the recent American practice to be lightly dismissed. His Majesty &quot;s Government would view with grave anxiety the summoning of such an international conference unless the ground had been carefully prepared by diplomatic channels, and it had been shown that there was sufficient basis of agreement to render success at least probable. If, therefore, the United States Government are seriously contemplating any action of the kind, it is important to convey to them without delay the earnest hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that, in the interests of ultimate agreement, the first step may be by unofficial and strictly confidential conversations. It should be clearly understood that. His Majesty*s Government do not wish to invite, or encourage the initiation of, such confidential conversations at the present moment. They realise, however, that the very worst thing would be another failure due to insufficient preparation, such as occurred at Geneva, and, if your Excellency sees serious reason to expect the issue of invitations to a conference, you should, without delay, bring the matter up in conversation with Mr. Kellogg. I leave it to your Excellency to decide whether it is preferable that a warning in this sense should be given in the first instance as from yourself, or whether you should inform Mr. Kellogg that you are speaking under instructions.7. Assuming, however, that you have as yet no reason to suppose that a move in this direction is impending, it would, nevertheless, be of great interest to us to get a clearer idea than we at present possess of the trend of American official opinion both in the State Department and the Navy Department on these questions. There have been some speeches or writings which seem to suggest that a section at least of American naval opinion is coming round to the view that in the altered circumstances-stances of to-day the interest of the United States lies rather in upholding than in scaling clown the rights of a belligerent. You will consider whether the naval attache should be instructed to be especially on the watch for any information in regard to this point. You will, of course, realise that no enquiries should be made which could possibly give the impression that His Majesty&quot;s Government are desirous of raising this issue or are unduly apprehensive in regard to it.8. In view of the complexity and delicacy of these questions, I am sending this despatch by Mr. Craigie, who will place before you fully the conclusions provisionally reached during the deliberations of the Committee on Belligerent Rights, and explain the various difficulties encountered by the Committee in its consideration of this subject. He will be able to give your Excellency an outline of the numerous and valuable documents submitted to the Committee in the course of its enquiries, which are either not suitable, for textual transmission abroad or require for their full appreciation some account of the discussions out of which they arose or to which they gave rise. In the light of this information, your Excellency&quot;will be in a position to furnish him with a full expression of your own views for the. benefit of the Committee. It was at first suggested that I should ask your Excellency to come home at once on some family pretext in order that the Committee might have the. full benelit of your know-ledge and experience, but we have thought it would be more convenient to you and on other grounds more prudent that you should take your leave at the time, proposed by yourself and that I should send Mr. Craigie on a similar pretext to the States.
9. The ostensible purpose, of Mr. Craigie&apos;s journey will, therefore, be to pay a visit to his relatives in Georgia, and he will himself make no enquiries while in Washington without your Excellency&apos;s full approval. It seems desirable, however, that, while in Washington, he should pay the usual calls of courtesy on the officials of the State Department, and if, during these interviews, the conversation turned, as it well might, to recent press controversies on the subject of belligerent rights at sea, he might be able to gain some impression of the general attitude of the Adminis-tration towards these questions. He would, of course, be careful to avoid any appearance of initiating a negotiation or of being the bearer of any communication from His Majesty&apos;s Government, and would make it plain in anything that he said that he was speaking in a private capacity and without any instructions. He will, in any case, first discuss the matter fully with your Excellency and abstain even from making such soundings as I have suggested above should your Excellency consider such action undesirable in present circumstances.I am, &amp;c.AUSTEN CHAMKKRUAIN.
