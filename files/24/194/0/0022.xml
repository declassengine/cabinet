THIS DOCmEK-i. IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNIrfflMT.SECRET. Copy No._2.CP.122(28)CABINET.SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. Safeguarding of Monumental and Architectural Granite. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate the Report of the Committee appointed under the Safeguarding of Industries Procedure to consider an application for a duty on Monumental and Architectural Granite wholly or mainly manufactured.    The Committee ara. 3. report that, while the number of persons engaged in theindustry was originally stated by the applicants to be 4,798, deduction has to be made of certain classes of persons such as the employees in quarries obtaining the raw granite, the employees in a section of the Industry which was withdrawn from the application, and former employees who have left the industry and found employment elsewhere.   They find that the volume of employment engaged upon the production of the goods to which the application relates, within the meaning of the White f-ra. 9. Paper, does not exceed 2,750 persons, and they are accordingly unable to report that the industry is of pa. 10, substantial importance.The Committee state that as the application thus fails upon a primary point they were agreed that they would not be  justified in requiring the parties to incur jra. 11. tae further heavy expenditure involved by an investigation of the remaining points upon which they were instructed to j report in accordance with the tfhite Paper.I regret, that the Committee did not make a report covering all the questions which they are rwquirod by the
White Paper to answer.      If the Committee had done this and had answered the othor questions In the applicants&apos; favour, the Cabinet might have decided that the industry was of sufficient importance to justify the imposition of a duty.   As it is, I can only recommend that the Report should be published, in accordance with our established practice, just before the budget; and that no duty should be imposed.This unsatisfactory inquiry confirms the view, which our Trade Policy Committee has reached, that in modifying our procedure in another Parliament we should establish a Standing Committee for any inquiries that are necessary.(Intd. ) P.C -L.Board of Trade,13th April, 1923.
SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE onMONUMENTAL AND ARCHITECTURAL GRANITE WHOLLY OR MAINLY MANUFACTURED.To the Right HonourableSir Philip Cunliffe-Listor, K.B.E., M.C., M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,1. The Committee was appointed by you in terms of Minutes of the 16th and 25th January, 1928, to inquire into and report up^n the application made by the Aberdeen Granite Manufacturers&apos; Association in accordance with the terms of the memorandum relating to Procedure and Enquiries in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries, presented to Parliament on 3rd February, 1925, for the imposition of a duty upon monumental and architectural granite, wholly or mainly manufactured.2. The Committee has held five public meetings and has heard eleven witnesses.3. The applicants were the Aberdeen Granite Manufacturers&apos; Association &quot;on behalf of the whole industry with the concurrence and at the request of the Cornish Granite Merchants&apos; and Quarry-masters&apos; Association and other manufacturers in the United Kingdom&quot;.   They were represented by Mr. &quot;J.D. Essleraont, Secretary to the applicant association.4. The Opponents were a group of importers and merchants and were represented by Mr. N. L. Macaskie and Mr. Basil Herbert,        I
instructed by Messrs. stikeman and Company.5. The term &quot;Monumental and Architectural Granite, wholly or mainly manufactured&quot; is deemed by the Industry to include dock and engineering granite &quot;dressed for fixing&quot; as well as granite worked for monumental and for external and internal architectural purposes.    At an early meeting of the Committee, the Applicants intimated that they did not desire to include dock and engineering granite within the terms of the application as the imports of this group have been reduced to trifling proportions as the result of the decisions of the Government and most local authorities to specify British Granite for their public works.6.    There appears to be no manufacturers1 organisation covering Great Britain as a -whole.    In Cornwall and Devon the organisation is of comparatively recent growth and is unable to furnish statistics of any value of employment, etc., over a period of years.    As a result, data -rhich would enable an effective estimate of total employment to be made are not available except in the case of Scotland.     The skilled men and apprentices employed in the manufacturing section of the industry in Scotland are members of the monumental branch of the Building and Monumental Workers Association of Scotland and particulars of their employment are available from 1911.    In official statistics the information available relates to a considerably larger field of employment such as,  all stone cutting, dressing, etc., than that covered by the application but there appears to be no satisfactory means of estimating the proportion of those^with whom the Committee is concerned.7.    It is obvious that since the war the industry has been occupied with a quite abnormal quantity of work in the form of War Memorial which is unlikely to recur and cannot be accepted as part of the   normal demand upon the industry. This work
was substantial in 1920, continued into 1923/24 and Is an important factor in considering the ebb and flow of post-war employment.8.    In the formal application submitted by the applicantsthe figures for employment total 4,798 but it was apparent tothe Committee that these figures included employees in quarrieswho as responsible for the raw material, could not be held tocome within the scope of the application.     This fact, coupled with almost complete absence of reliable data aa to employment,led the&apos; Committee to direct the applicants to concentrate inthe first instance upon sub-section (l) of Section 2 of theProcedure and Enquiries, namely:-1. &apos;7hether the industry is, by reason of the volume of employment engaged in the production of the&quot;&quot; goods to which the application relates or by reason of the nature of the goods produced, of substantial importance.Upon a fair Interpretation of the terms of this sub-section the Committee feels that it has no option but to exclude from consideration employees engaged in quarrying granite, even though this granite may be utilised only for the purpose of manufacturing the goods which come within the scope of the application, and that although persons now unemployed in the jionumental and Architectural section of the industry can reasonably be included,  those who have left the applicant industry and found employment elsewhere, are not admissible.     Persons employed upon &quot;dressing&quot; dock and engineering granite are necessarily excluded by reason of the withdrawal of this section of work from the application.9.   A statement handed in by the applicants is reproduced in Appendix I hereto.     The Committee has hoard all the applicants&apos; witneoses in support of these figures and has come to the conclusion that in view of the interpretation that the
Committee feels bound to place upon this sub-Section tho applicants have failed to substantiate their figures and that the volume of employment engaged upon the production of the goods to *which the application relates does not exceed 3,750 persons in Great Britain and northern Ireland.10.   Having regard therefore to the explicit terms of the -white Paper the committee has unanimously decided that It is unable to report that the industry is of substantial importance, by reason of the volume of employment.11.    As the application thus fails upon a primary point, the Committee unanimously agree that it would not be justified in requiring the p-pplicants and opposition to incur the further heavy expenditure vhich would be involved by an investigation of the remaining points set out in the procedure and Enquiries.12. The members of the Committee desire to place on record their warm appreciation of the close attention which Mr. Griffin, the Secretary, has given to the business of the Committee, and to express their grateful thanks to   him for the able assistance .&apos;.which they have received from him throughout the proceedings.Te havethe honour to be,Sir,Yourobedient servants,Harold Snagge(Chairman)H.C. Baskerville Mynora.A.E. Holmes.HY7. Griffin,Secretary,50th inarch, 1028.
