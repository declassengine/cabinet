REPORT.I. INTRODUCTION.A. Composition and Terms of Reference.ON the 23rd January, 1928, the Prime Minister appointed a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research composed of: Sir Herbert Hamblin^, Bart. (Chairman);Sir Sydney Chapman, K.C.B., C.B.E.,Chief Economic Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government;Mr. G. C. Upcott, C.B.,Deputy Controller of Supply Services, His Majesty&apos;s Treasury;Mr. A. F. Hemming. C.B.E., Assistant Secretary to the Committee x     of Civil Research.Secretary to the Sub-Committee;with the following terms of reference : &quot; To consider the operation and effects of the temporary restrictions now in force on the export of rubber from certain territories in the Empire, and to consider the question whether these restrictions should be continued in their present form, modified, or removed, and to submit recommendations both as to the policy to be adopted and as to the steps to be taken to carry it into effect.&quot;B. Arrangement of Report.2. In submitting our Report to the Committee of Civil Research, we have thought it convenient to describe briefly the origin and character of the present restriction scheme (Section II) and then to describe the present position as disclosed by the rubber statistics of the last five years (Section III). In Section IV we deal with the principal points disclosed by the evidence which we have received. In this Section we have followed the division of subject marked out by our terms of reference, and have addressed ourselves in the first instance to the question whether the present restrictions should be continued in their present form, modified or removed. On reaching our conclusions on that question we devote the remainder of the Section to the second matter on which our advice is asked, viz., the steps to be taken to carry our recommendations into effect. For the convenience of the Committee of Civil Research we have, in Section V, summarised our principal conclusions and our recommendation.3 In the Appendices we give supplementary information on a number of points referred to in our Report. Appendix A contains a list of the witnesses who have given oral evidence before us. Appendix B consists of the restriction scheme as recommended in the Second (and final) sReport, submitted in October 1922, by the Advisory Committee appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies under the Chairmanship of Lord (then Sir James) Stevenson, and the supplementary regula-tions issued by the Colonial Office in October 1926. In Appendix C we give the best available statistics which we have been able to obtain in regard to the working of the restriction scheme. In Appendix D we reproduce the two main schemes which have been submitted by the witnesses whom we have heard. Both schemes contemplate a gradual reduction of the pivotal price by threepenny falls at the end of every twelve months until a stable price level is reached. While both schemes provide that in certain circumstances the restriction scheme shall cease to be operative, the main difference between the two schemes is that Scheme (i) does, and Scheme (ii) does not, provide that in any event restriction should be withdrawn not later than the 31st October, 1931. Finally, we append, in Appendix E, a graph showing the London spot prices of rubber (smoked ribbed sheets) at the end of each quarter since 1920, and three diagrams showing respectively (a) the estimated-net exports of crude rubber, 1920-27; (b) the estimated exports of rubber from British Malaya, [17389] a 2
II. THE ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE RESTRICTION SCHEME.10. In considering the present restriction scheme, we did not feel called upon by our terms of reference to consider the value in 1922 of the scheme to the rubber industry, or the extent to which in the early stages it secured the ends for which it was designed. In their First Report, dateclMay 1922, the Committee presided overCeylon and the Netherlands East Indies, shown as percentages of the estimated world exports of plantation rubber, 1920-27; and (c) the estimated absorption of crude and reclaimed rubber in the United States of America, 1920-27, together with a graph showing the relation between the price of crude rubber and the absorption of reclaimed rubber since 1917.C. Procedure of the Sub-Committee. (i.) Preliminary Decisions.4. At our first meeting we discussed the procedure to be adopted by us and decided to open our Inquiry by taking evidence, which would inform us of the intro-duction and working of the present system of restriction of rubber exports from British Malaya and Ceylon. Thereafter we proposed to hear evidence on the merits of the present system from all branches of the industry, to be followed by such further evidence as might appear necessary in the light of suggestions or criticisms received.5. At the same time we asked the Colonial Office to ascertain from the High Commissioner of Malaya and from the Governor of Ceylon whether they desired to submit any observations to us or to forward any representations from responsible local bodies in their territories. By this means we have received valuable indications of local opinion both in Malaya and in Ceylon, as well as the views of the Govern-ments of those territories.(ii.) Oral Evidence.6. We began the hearing of evidence on the 13th February, 1928. Our first witness was Sir Gilbert Grindle, K.C.M.G., C.B., Assistant tinder-Secretary of State, Colonial Office. He was followed by Mr. W. Peel, C.M.G., Chief Secretary to Government, Federated Malay States; Sir Matthew Nathan, G.C.M.G., Chairman, Colonial Office Rubber Advisory Committee; Sir Laurence Guillemard, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., late High Commissioner, Federated Malay States; Mr. E. B. Alexander, C.M.G., late Controller of Revenue, Ceylon; and by other witnesses who now hold or have held official positions bringing them into direct touch with one or other aspect of the restriction scheme. In addition, we heard a witness from the Board of Trade, who explained the basis on which the rubber statistics officially supplied to us are prepared, and a witness who gave us expert evidence in regard to rubber reclamation. This completed our general survey of the present system of restriction.7. On the 1st March, 1928, we heard evidence from a representative of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. At later meetings witnesses appeared before us representing the India Rubber Manufacturers&apos; Association, the Association of British Malaya, the Rubber Growers&apos; Association, the Ceylon Association, and the Rubber Trade Association of London. In addition, we received evidence from representatives nominated by the Committee of the Stock Exchange. All the evidence was submitted on the understanding that it would be treated as confidential.8. We held eighteen meetings for the purpose of hearing evidence. A full list of the witnesses is given in Appendix A.(iii.) Written Evidence.9. In addition to the evidence taken orally, we received a large number of written communications in regard to particular aspects of our Inquiry. All the witnesses heard orally were requested to furnish beforehand a detailed precis of their evidence. We desire to place on record our indebtedness to all who have assisted us in our Inquiry, whether by giving oral evidence or by furnishing memoranda.
by Lord Stevenson submitted two alternative schemes for restricting rubber supplies. They said that, in their view, &quot;a policy of restriction can only be a temporary palliative,&quot; and they concluded their Report with the following paragraph: &quot; Until the attitude of the Dutch is definitely known, the Committee are unable to carry their inquiry further, as they cannot recommend the adoption of either of the proposed schemes by only one or more British Colony or Protectorate.&quot;11. The Netherlands Government, when approached, replied that they coultl not agree to introduce statutory restriction of rubber exports in their East Indian Colonies. In October 1922. the Committee submitted their Second Report reversing their previous opinion and recommending that &quot;a scheme of Government intervention should be put into operation in Ceylon, the Malay States and the Straits Settlements as soon as possible.&quot;12. They stated that this recommendation was made in view of (a) the excessive and increasing production of rubber owing to the failure of voluntary restriction,(b) the general demand of the rubber industry in London and Malaya, (c) the probable increased world consumption of rubber over their previous estimate, (d) &quot;the predominating interest in the rubber industry held by British producers.&apos;&apos; and(c) the voluntary adhesion to the restriction scheme of a number of British Rubber Companies owning estates in the Netherlands East Indies. The text of the scheme which they recommended is given in Appendix B.13. These proposals were approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government and restriction-tion of rubber exports on the lines which they recommended was introduced by local legislation in the several Territories on the 1st November, 1922. Since its introduction, the scheme has remained unaltered in its main outlines, except that in May 1926 the pivotal price was raised from 1/3 to 1/9, the figure at which it now stands. The actual percentages released in successive quarters are shown in the table given in paragraph 23.14. A considerable number of changes have, however, been made from time to time in the administrative machinery required to give effect to it in Malaya and Ceylon. Thus, the basis of assessment of the standard production of the estates has been revised with a view to correcting the over-assessments made when the scheme was first imposed. As regards Malaya, a good many witnesses stated that the new assessment brought into operation on the 1st February last, which represents a reduction of 16 per cent, on the assessment of the previous year, is so rigorous that a nominal restriction to 60 per cent, of standard production means in some cases a restriction of 50 per cent, or even more of actual productive capacity. A number of changes have been introduced in both Territories regarding the assessment of native rubber, the effect of which, it has been alleged by some witnesses, has been to give the native a preferential position as compared with the European planter. On the other hand, there is no doubt that in Ceylon the restriction scheme is thoroughly unpopular with the native growers, who consider that by it preferential treatment is given to the large capitalist estates. In matters of administration and routine, it has not been found possible to apply the scheme on uniform lines in Ceylon and Malaya. To a large extent this diversity of practice has no doubt been inevitable owing to local circumstances; but it is clear that in recent years its existence has been the cause of dissatisfaction with the restriction scheme, both on the part of particular classes within the restricting Territories and as between the growers in one Territory and another.III.-THE PRESENT POSITION.15. In seeking to form a just appreciation of the present position under the restriction scheme, we have obtained the fullest statistics available from official sources, supplemented in certain cases by material furnished by the Rubber Growers&apos; Association and other unofficial quarters, showing the development of different factors since 1922, e.g., acreage, exports, absorption, &amp;c. The figures of native acreage are conjectural; but allowing for an inevitable margin of error, we are satisfied that the tables which we give in Appendix C correctly indicate the trend of development during the past five years.
16.   An examination of these statistics shows the following position : A. Share of Malaya and Ceylon in Total Would Exports of Rubber.17. During the currency of the restriction scheme which, so far as the law is concerned, applies only to British Malaya and Ceylon, rubber production in areas out-side the restricted area has been greatly stimulated, notably in the Netherlands East Indies. It is true that British estates in the latter territory and in certain other areas have applied the scheme to varying extents by voluntary methods, but it is not to be expected that such methods could have such drastic effects as statutory arrange-ments administered by Government officials. In fact, the output of rubber from British estates in the Netherlands East Indies has increased between 192:2 and 1927 by over 35 per cent., which is about three times the corresponding increase in British Malaya. Naturally the unrestricted areas which reap all the benefits of restriction and carry none of its burdens, except partially on a voluntary basis, have not failed to take full advantage of the opportunity afforded them of supplanting their trade rivals. Tables V to VIII of Appendix C show clearly the developments which have taken place.* The share of Malaya and Ceylon in the total world exports of planta-tion and wild rubber has fallen from nearly two-thirds in 1922 to less than one-half in 1927 (from 65 per cent, to under 50 per cent.). The output of the Netherlands East Indies has increased during that period by about 145 per cent..as compared with increases of about 13 per cent, only in Malaya and Ceylon, and its share of world exports is over 38 per cent, in 1927, as compared with 23 per cent, in 1922. The major part of this increase has been in native-grown rubber, which has risen from 17.000 tons in 1922 to approximately 100,000 tons, or one-sixth of total world exports in 1927. It seems probable that in the current year the production of the Nether-lands East Indies will equal, if, indeed it does not exceed, that of Malaya under restriction.18. In interpreting these figures allowance must, of course, be made for the fact that the exports from British territories are restricted by law, whereas the only check on exports from other areas is the voluntary limitation imposed on themselves by certain British Companies operating in those areas. Further, a certain amount of rubber included in the figures of Dutch exports is probably rubber smuggled from British Malaya. It should also be borne in mind in considering the amount of rubber exports from non-restricted areas since 1922 that this increase of produc-tion is not attributable in any appreciable degree to rubber produced from trees planted since the introduction of restriction. It is the produce partly of rubber planted some years before 1922 coming into bearing, partly of heavier tapping and partly of the tapping of trees which in other circumstances, such as a less remunerative price, would not have been tapped at all. In fact, the statistical evidence indicates that, irrespective of additional planting since 1922, the elasticity of production in the unrestricted areas has been much greater than was generally anticipated.B. Acreage under Rubber.19. A still more important indication of future developments is to be found in statistics of the acreage under rubber in various countries, and especially of planting since 1922. Such particulars as are available are given in Tables I to IV of Appendix C. Complete particulars of the acreage under rubber in the various areas cannot be obtained, but it is possible to compare the figures for Estates in the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States with those for the Netherlands East Indies. It will be seen from Table I in Appendix C that since 1922 the increase of the acreage in the former area is 7i per cent, only, while in the Netherlands East Indies it is 18 per cent. A part of this growth has been in British-owned estates, which have increased from 270,000 acres in 1922 to 350,000 acres, partly owing to the purchase of non-British estates, but, while this fact is in itself gratifying, it at the same time emphasises the comparative lack of develop-ment in Malaya. In the Non-Federated Malay States new plantings, whether of estate or of native rubber, appear to have been inconsiderable since 1922. On the other hand, while precise statistics are impossible to obtain, it is clear that native plantings in the Netherlands East Indies have increased enormously. A new and formidable competitor with British rubber has come into being. As? we have pointed cut in paragraph 17, the production of native rubber from trees planted before* See also tlio charts printed us Tables 2 uuH ;!, Appendix E.
the trade depression (mainly in the years 1915-19) has increased from a negligible figure to about 100,000 tons a year. Milling factories are being established at various centres to deal with this rubber, which has hitherto been shipped to Singapore. The reports of the Department of Agriculture in the Netherlands East Indies and of the British Commercial Agent in Batavia, which we have had before us, indicate that native plantings were actively resumed in 1922, and have been carried on even more energetically since 1925. The acreage can only be deduced from the figures of production and the available evidence as to the method of planting followed by the natives and the average yield per tree. The Rubber Growers&apos; Association have furnished us with an estimate of 500,000 acres planted, of which they calculate that 200,000 acres are now in bearing. This calculation assumes an average production of 800 lbs. per acre, as compared with the Dutch official estimate of 535 lbs. an acre (1 kilogram per tree per annum, and 600 productive trees per hectare). After careful consideration of all the evidence, and particularly of the Dutch official returns, we think that even on the assumption of very close planting and a high yield per acre in bearing the native planted area cannot lie less (and&quot; may well be more) than 750,000 acres, and we have inserted this figure in Table III of Appendix C. In the Dutch reports to which we have just referred it is stated that it would be justifiable to say &quot; that everywhere the area of the young fields is 100 per cent, to 200 per cent, above that of the old fields.&quot; These new plantings will begin to come into bearing from the present year and onwards, and it is regarded as not impossible that the output of native rubber may increase within the next four or five years to as much as 175,000 tons, and eventually to 200,000 tons a year. When it is observed that the population of the Netherlands East Indies is rather over 50 millions, as compared with 3j millions in Malaya and 5 millions in Ceylon, and that the declared policy of the Dutch Colonial Government is to encourage native planting by every means in their power and to extend railway construction in Sumatra, the serious nature of the competition which will have to be faced in the near future will be realised. If present tendencies continue, the productive capacity of the Netherlands East Indies may at no distant date equal that of Malaya and&apos; Ceylon combined.20. It was suggested to us in evidence that, if the amount of British-owned acreage in the Netherlands East Indies is added to the acreage in whatever ownership in British territories, the proportion is not less than 70 per cent, of the total. This calculation is based inter alia on a figure of 500,000 acres for native small holdings in the Netherlands East Indies which, as explained in paragraph 19, we think unduly low. Apart from this qualification, we are unable to re rard this comparison as material in estimating the effects of the policy of restriction. In any case, however, the proportion is undoubtedly a diminishing one at the present time, nor can we regard an increase of British-owned acreatre in a foreign country as adequate compensation for the lack of development in British territories.C. Reclaimed Rubber.21. The output of reclaimed rubber in the United States of America has risen, as appears from Table XI of Appendix C, from 54,000 tons in 1922 to some 180,000 tons in 1927, viz., by no less than 230 per cent., or from one-sixth to nearly one-third of the total amount of rubber consumed in that country.* In other words, the United States have economised in the use of rubber, and the share taken by them of the world production of plantation and wild rubber has fallen from 71 per cent, in 1922 to 61 per cent, in 1927. While it is probably true that for certain purposes there will always be an appreciable demand for reclaimed rubber, there can be no doubt that the high price of plantation rubber has led to its substitution to a considerable extent by reclaimed rubber, chiefly in the United States, and to a great development of the reclaiming industry. This factor involves in present cireum-stances a material diminution in the American demand for plantation rubber, and is, therefore, of serious moment to the British producing industry. The graph printed as Table 5 of Appendix E suggests that up to 1925 there was a close relation between the price of crude rubber and the absorption of reclaimed rubber, but it will be observed that in the last two years this absorption has continued to increase, notwithstanding the decline of the price of rubber. This fact suggests that the reclaiming industry may be becoming more firmly established.22. We have sought by every means at our disposal to inform ourselves of the cost of producing reclaimed rubber and of the value of the reclaimed material.   The&quot; See also the chart priuted as Table 4, Appendix E.
position appears to be that the lowest grades of reclaimed rubber can be sold by the reclaimer with a small profit at 4td.-bd. a lb., and the price of the highest grade of reclaimed rubber amounts to as much as lid. a lb. Witnesses varied in their estimate of the value of reclaimed rubber. All agreed that for certain purposes in tyre manufacture small quantities of reclaimed rubber will always be required, and that for cheap rubber goods, the lower grades of reclaimed rubber will be extensively used. Most of the witnesses considered that, apart from this demand, the use of reclaimed rubber would substantially diminish if there was any considerable fall in the price of plantation rubber. The general opinion appeared to be that, particularly in the motor tyre industry, the use of reclaimed rubber would eventually be-greatly reduced if the cost of plantation rubber stood in the neighbourhood of if- a lb.D. Rubber Prices and Stocks.23. The relations between the spot price of rubber (standard quality smoked sheet) per pound in the London market up to the present time, and the exportable percentages permitted, are shown in the following table : -	Pivotal Price.

In August, 1922, rubber had fallen as low as G^d. per pound. In the following weeks it rose to about 1/- per pound, owing, we have no doubt, to anticipa-tion of the coming of restriction. Early in 1923 it rose as high as 1/6, but it fell away to below lid. in the middle of 1924. London stocks had been gradually falling and, stimulated by the steady growth of world demand which is shown by the figures given in Table IX of Appendix C, the price rose steadily, and from the second quarter of 1925 rapidly, reaching 4/6 towards the end of that year. The first quarter of 1926 witnessed a sharp fall to 2/1, after which time it fell gradually, subject to occasional slight upward fluctuations, to about 1/6 at the end of January 192S.25. It will be seen from the foregoing table and from the graph given in Table 1 of Appendix E, that the restriction scheme has not secured a stable price during its operation. It probably helped to secure the moderate recovery which occurred during 1923 and 1924, and it was one of the causes of the very sharp rise of price which occurred in 1925, but The high level then reached was not maintained, and since the middle of 1926 restriction, although applied with increasing severity, has been unable to secure the pivotal price of 1/9 then adopted.
&apos;2d. As shown in Table X of Appendix C, rubber stocks in the United Kingdom and the Far East, which stood at 122.000 tons on the 1st November, 1.922, were reduced under restriction to 90,000 tons on the 1st November, 1923, after which date they fell steadily to 21,000 tons on the 1st November, 1925. On the 1st January, 1928, they had increased again to approximately the same amount as on the 1st November, 1923. Complete and reliable figures of the stocks held in America cannot be secured, but the figures given in Table X show an increase from 34.000 tons in ,1925 to 100,000 tons in January 1928. Witnesses informed us that, in view of the intensified restriction now in force in Malaya, a considerable reduction of the existing stocks was expected in the course of the present year. Having regard to the steadily increasing production of the Netherlands East Indies, we do&quot; not think that any such reduction could be more than temporary, unless consumption increases at a considerably faster rate than it has in the last few years.IV.-EVIDENCE RECEIVED ON THE PRESENT SYSTEM AND CONCLUSIONS  OF THE  SUB-COMMITTEE.A. The Question whether Restriction should he Continued in its present form, Modified or Removed.27. We now propose to summarise the main points of the evidence which we have received and to indicate the conclusions which we draw therefrom. In the previous Section we have drawn attention in dealing with rubber restriction statistics to the stimulus given to rubber production areas outside the British (restricted) area. All the witnesses who appealed before us admitted that during restriction the rubber industry in Dutch territory has greatly developed and that there has been a shrinkage of the relative proportion of British to Dutch rubber production. Some of the witnesses regarded this aspect of the question as very serious and as demanding immediate attention. Others, while agreeing that the situation required watching, supported the continuance of restriction even if it entailed a further diminution of the British share of world production.28. It appears to us that the longer the restriction continues, and the more, in consequence, it has to be regarded, not as a merely temporary expedient, but as a semi-permanent arrangement, the more marked will the present disproportionate development of production in the unrestricted territories tend to become. Moreover, apart from the menace of Dutch native rubber to which we have already referred, the estates operating outside British territories must continue to gain financial strength in their competition with estates operating under compulsory restriction, seeing that the former (except in so far as they restrict to some extent voluntarily^) enjoy the advantage of producing to full capacity, and, therefore, at the minimum cost.29. The following table shows the tendency for the diminution in exports from British restricted territories to be met by increases from unrestricted areas : -	Average exportable Percentage.

30. Since 1922, rubber estates in the Netherlands East Indies have l)een in a position of great advantage. They have been able to increase their exports in order to fill the gap created by restriction in British territories, and by producing at their maximum capacity to gain the full benefit of high prices when prices rose, and owing to lower overhead costs to compete more effectually with British companies when prices fell. In consecpience of the extensive plantings after restriction was introduced, there are serious grounds for a fear that, if the present restrictions are retained, the companies in Dutch territory will be able to force those in British territory permanently down to the reduced output which is now theoretically regarded as temporary.31. Moreover, planters in British controlled territories would be in a position of great disadvantage in competing with the Dutch, not only because of the financial strength derived from restriction by the undertakings in Dutch territory, hut also because of the improved cultivation and management which has been fostered in the Netherlands East Indies by the prosperity of the industry there. There can be no doubt that scientific methods of cultivation, for instance, bud-grafting and seed selection, are far more advanced in the Netherlands East Indies than in Malaya or Ceylon. We have been gravely impressed by the evidence that restriction has tended definitely to discourage the adoption of such methods, and. relatively, to penalise the more efficient estates. Moreover, it is apparently only quite recently that steps have been taken in British territory to foster research on such problems, and some years must elapse before full advantage can be taken by British planters of the scientific developments already achieved in this field by Dutch initiative. In addition to the advantages so secured, there appear to be ample supplies of suitable land available in the Netherlands East Indies. So far. therefore, as physical causes are concerned, the Dutch seem to possess possibilities of a wide extension of rubber growing in their territories. The output obtainable from these areas appears to be highly elastic over a short period, and the future seems to have been provided for by new plantings. Trees nave been tapped that would not have been tapped in the absence of the place made for their output in,the market by restriction, particularly those in native hands. Moreover, trees&quot; can apparently be tapped heavily in any one year, or for a number of years consecutively, without being destroyed, provided they are given a rest afterwards, as can be clone without any reduction of supplies, if at that time new areas come into bearing. Again, if the price is tempting, it may be worth while to tap young trees before they would have been tapped otherwise.32. A number of witnesses in their evidence drew attention to the difficulty, which is increasing year by year, of regulating the market for any appreciable period by means of the restriction scheme, owing to the. fact that supplies from the Netherlands East Indies, which would not have appeared in the absence of restric-tion. rapidly take the place of the British supplies withheld under restriction. Further, it is obvious that with the progressive reduction of the percentage of world output drawn from British territories, it becomes increasingly difficult to affect the price of rubber by means of restriction confined to those territories. For example, if it is desired to secure a reduction of 20 per cent, in world supplies, a restriction of 30 per cent, is sufficient if British territories produce two-thirds of the world output, but a restriction of as much as 40 per cent, is needed if their share of world output falls to one half.33. Having regard to all the circumstances, we are of opinion that the con-tinuance of restriction in Malaya and Ceylon is steadily becoming less capable of influencing the world price of rubber and that it will very soon be. altogether ineffee-tive for that purpose. Indeed, the price to-day is probably little higher than it would have been in the absence of any restrictive policy. A temporary drop in price may, however, occur when restriction is ultimately removed, because for the moment there may be on the market not merely the extra Dutch supplies artificially brought, into existence, but, in addition perhaps, part of the released stocks in British-controlled territories, amounting usually to about two months&apos; supply, and their increased output. There is, however, reason to believe that some at least of the stronger companies would be more likely to hold their stocks than to throw them upon a falling market. The fall in price has, in our view, been anticipated to some extent already through the announcement of the present inquiry, and in course of time the market may be expected to be supported in some, degree by the substitution of crude
rubber for reclaimed rubber. As already shewn in paragraph 22, substitution would probably operate appreciably with rubber at a price of about a shilling a pound. The possibilities in this direction are considerable, since about 180.000 tons of reclaimed rubber were consumed in the United States in 11)27. This substitution would, however, be gradual, as the reclaimers would no doubt for a. time try-to maintain their present level of output even at a loss.34. Our attention has been directed to the importance of British rubber exports in the balance of trade, and we have given careful consideration to this aspect of the matter. In our opinion, the continuance, of restriction cannot now be relied upon to have any beneficial effect on our trade balance. In fact, it is likely to have the opposite effect. As we have shown. British exports are being replaced by exports from the Netherlands East Indies and elsewhere and by the use of reclaimed rubber. The restriction scheme is, we think, losing its power to affect the world price of rubber. In these circumstances, the most important rubber factor affecting the balance of trade will be the quantity of rubber exported by British companies wherever they are. And. inasmuch as the production of British companies in British territories is being checked by restriction, and the stimulus given to production in non-British territories is enjoyed by all the producers there, whether British eom-panies or not (except in so far as the former have voluntarily renounced this advantage), it follows that the amount of rubber exported to-day by British companies is less than it would have been if there had been no restriction at all. while the price obtained for this smaller amount is not correspondingly increased. We are of opinion that the position of the British rubber-planting industry in the markets of the world can only be satisfactorilv maintained in future by full production.35. We have had before us the suggestion that the restriction scheme might be made effective in future if the Dutch Government could be induced to reconsider the decision at which they arrived in 1922 not to co-operate in the policy then adopted by the British Government. We have carefully considered whether it would be desirable again to approach the Dutch Government with a view to obtaining their concurrence in an extended restriction scheme; but, having regard to all the available evidence, we are of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served by so doing. The evidence received forces us to conclude that, even if, as we do not think is the case, there were any grounds for believing that the Dutch Government would be prepared to reverse their declared policy in the matter, the inherent difficulties of working restriction under even the most favourable conditions place it beyond the powers of the administration in the Dutch Colonies to make it effective, and that these difficulties are magnified in this particular case by the extent of native produc-tion over vast areas as yet scarcely surveyed, and the ease with which evasion and smuggling could be carried out. We also share the fear which was expressed that any agreement with the Dutch would have the effect of perpetuating to some extent the handicap under which planters in British territory now labour. We have received many representations as to the difficulties which have been experienced in securing uniform administration and equal treatment as between Malaya and Ceylon. If these difficulties have arisen between two British Colonial administrations, it would, in our opinion, be impossible, with the introduction of a foreign Government into the scheme, to expect that it could be consistently and effectively applied over much wider areas with more than dual control. We are aware that there are prospects that negotiations may be instituted by representatives of the Dutch rubber-growing industry with British producers, and possibly also American consumers, with a view to the consideration of a selling policy. In our opinion, there is no likelihood that such developments could become fruitful until it is made clear to all concerned that the existing restriction scheme in Malaya and Ceylon is to be removed. We consider that it is a prior condition of any progress on these lines that a definite date for the termination of restriction should be fixed, so that the British rubber industry may be free to make the best arrangements possible in the circumstances. We do not think that the Government can itself usefully intervene in any such arrangements.36.   We referred in the last paragraph to the administrative difficulties which have been experienced by the Governments of Malaya and Ceylon in the application id&apos; the scheme.   We have been impressed by the evidence as to the difficulty of assessing equitably the standard production, especially of native holdings, and tho [17389] c 2
extent of the smuggling and illicit traffic in coupons which undoubtedly prevail and which it seems impossible entirely to prevent. In general it is clear that the opportunities for dishonesty offered by the restriction scheme have had a demoralising effect on the native population of Malaya and Ceylon, and to a certain extent on the subordinate ranks of the Government services. We should not feel that these administrative difficulties could be regarded as insuperable objections to the continuance of the scheme if that course were thought desirable on grounds of public policy, and in the interests of the British rubber industry as a whole, but they cannot he ignored in a general review of the position.37. We have obtained some information as to rubber-planting projects which have recently been undertaken by American interests in Liberia and Brazil. These projects appear to be still in an experimental stage and in view especially of the labour difficulties which have yet to lie surmounted in those areas, we see no reason to question the opinion expressed to us by witnesses that they do not constitute an appreciable factor in the present situation.38. On a review of the whole field it appears to us that the chief danger with which the British rubber-producing industry is faced is the growth of native rubber production in the Netherlands East Indies. While the opinions of the witnesses who appeared before us differed, the general view appears to be that, as in the case of reclaimed rubber, native rubber production is likely to be checked considerably by the fall of rubber prices. In this direction, and in that of the increased consumption which should eventually result from lower prices, must lie the hope that British rubber may hereafter be able to maintain its position in the markets of the world.39. For the reasons set forth in the foregoing paragraphs we have reached . the conclusion that the restriction scheme cannot now be relied upon to maintain a stable price for rubber. In our opinion, the continuance of the scheme has now become most disadvantageous to growers in the restricted areas and seriously threatens the predominant position of the. British Empire as a producer of plantation rubber. It appears to us that these disadvantages and dangers will be enhanced in proportion to the length of time during which restriction is continued. Our answer to the first part of our terms of reference is, therefore, that the restriction scheme should be removed at the earliest possible date. In the following section we discuss what, having regard to all the circumstances, is the earliest date possible.B. Steps Requiked to give Effect to the Suh-Committee&apos;s general recommendations.40. We proceed now to consider what steps should be taken to carry into effect the removal of restriction which we recommend. Various schemes have been put before us. Some witnesses were in favour of a progressive reduction of the pivotal price to that end, others of the announcement of a fixed date for the termination, and others of a combination of the two. So far as a date for termination was suggested, there was considerable difference of opinion. To this question we have, in consequence, given particular attention.41. The following are the main types of plan which we have had before us, viz. : (i.) Removal on a tapering plan providing for periodical reduction of the pivotal price and spread over a period of from three to four years. (See Appendix D. (i)).(ii.) Removal after notice of from twelve to eighteen months.(iii.) Removal without notice or after very short notice.(i.) llemocal on a Tapering Plan.42. Against the first of these proposals there are very strong objections, both political and economic. It would tie the hands of the Government for the period proposed, whatever unforeseen circumstances might arise and however strong the case for complete release before the termination of the period might prove to be. The very essence of this scheme is that its adoption by the Government should be in
the nature of an irrevocable Government pledge, in order that the various rubber interests might know for certain where they stood and have security to that extent. To give a pledge for so long a period might place the Government in an extremely embarrassing situation, and the scheme adopted might prove in the result to be harmful to the majority of the interests concerned. Moreover, the security which it is said to give might well prove illusory. The future would undoubtedly be discounted to a greater or less extent and the market would not settle down&quot; to a healthy condition until restriction had actually been removed. The danger will be appreciated when it is realised that, whereas, with a full output, many efficiently managed estates can produce rubber at 8d. a lb., or even less, the severe restriction now in force in Malaya is estimated to raise the cost of production to little less than 1/-. If, as is quite likely, prices failed throughout the period to reach the pivotal price for the time being in force, producers in the restricted areas would be continuously limited to a low exportable percentage. In that event they would be placed in the difficult position of having to carry on for several years with prices little, if anything, above, and possibly even below, their cost of production.43. Further, there would certainly be considerable building-up of stocks on estates in restricted areas in anticipation of the moment when restriction would lie completely removed, and the existence of these stocks might have a more damaging effect upon the market at the date of termination of restriction than the advocates of this scheme now anticipate. The fact that during the next few years the very large new native plantings which, as we have previously described, have been carried out in the Netherlands East Indies since 1922 will come into being, is likely to aggravate these difficulties. Producers in the Netherlands East Indies would, moreover, have every incentive to keep up their output during this lengthy period of transition, and there would be a danger that the stocks accumulated in the restricted areas would come on a market already amply supplied. There would appear in these circumstances to be the makings of a very difficult situation, the risk of creating which ought to be avoided, if possible.44. Finally, there is the fundamental objection that the longer restriction continues the worse will become the position of producers in British controlled territory, and the more difficult will they find it after the removal of the restriction to rehabilitate their position, if they could ever do so. against the Dutch Estates and native producers in the Netherlands East Indies.(ii.) Removed with 12 to 18 Months&apos; Notice.45. The objections to the 3-4 years&apos; tapering scheme apply also to the second scheme, which envisages at least a year&apos;s notice, except that the latter would not tie the hands of the Government and producers in British-controlled territory for so long a period. Stocks would still be piled up on the restricted estates. The Dutch would be stimulated to exploit the market to the full limit of their powers within the period of&apos;notice. While the market would no doubt to a great extent discount the effect of removal, it would remain unsettled until restriction was finally removed. A proper relation between demand and supply could not be expected until the period of notice terminated. For these reasons, we are unable to recommend the adoption of this proposal.(iii.) Removal without Notice or after very Short Notice.4(i. Removal without notice or at very short notice is free from the objections attaching to either of the foregoing plans. The argument against this plan is that the sudden change would produce disorganisation, and that there would be serious depreciation of stocks both of rubber and of goods of which rubber is a main constituent. The evidence which we have received points to the fact that many contracts run for periods of from six to twelve months. Several witnesses thought that giving notice would make little or no real difference, since the future would be at once anticipated, and a fall in price would take place immediately notice was given. The majority of the interests concerned were, however, opposed to sudden removal, and the general opinion was that some notice would bo desirable.  We may
add that the prospect that restriction may he removed at a comparatively early date appears to have already been discounted, possibly to a considerable extent, by the recent fall in the price of rubber, which followed upon the announcement of the present inquiry.(iv.) Conclusions.47. After careful consideration of the varying views placed before us, we have reached the conclusion that in all the circumstances it would be in the best interests of the British rubber industry that the period of notice should not exceed six months. This period would give the local Governments sufficient time to make the necessary legislative and administrative arrangements for the termination of restriction. It would also give British rubber companies, which cannot immediately increase their output to the maximum capacity,, time to recruit labour and to adjust their organisation. In addition, our attention has been drawn by numerous witnesses to the fact that while no definite pledge has at any time been given by the Govern-ment, the industry have assumed that in the absence of notice to the contrary the scheme would run from year to year. The six months&apos; notice which we recommend w?ould carry on restriction to the end of the present restriction year, viz., the 31st October, 1928. As regards the period up to that date we recommend that no alteration should be made in the existing restriction scheme.48. We should add that if His Majesty*s Government should decide to adopt this recommendation, we regard it as essential, in order to terminate the uncertainty under which the industry now suffers, that this decision should be announced immediately.
Y. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION.49. For the convenience of the Committee of Civil Research, we summarise our principal conclusions as follows: (i.) The rapid growth of rubber supplies from, and the extension of plantings in, the unrestricted areas, the potentialities of which are very great, have made the restriction scheme increasingly ineffective to secure the objects for which it was introduced.(ii.) Owing to these causes it cannot be relied upon to maintain a stable price for a limited supply of rubber. It has failed to secure the pivotal price of l/9d. a lb. fixed in 1926, and is steadily becoming less capable of Influencing the world price of rubber or of preventing the accumulation of stocks.(iii.) The continuance of the scheme is now most disadvantageous to growers in the restricted areas and seviously threatens the predominant position of the British Empire as a producer of plantation rubber. If present tendencies continue, the productive capacity of the Netherlands East Indies may at no distant date equal that of British Malaya and Ceylon combined.(iy.) The effects of restriction now are (a) in the restricted areas to discourage progress in the management andcultivation of estates and to raise the cost of production;(b) in the unrestricted areas, particularly in the Netherlands east indies, to stimulate production and new plantings, not only of estate but also of native rubber, the increase of which has been enormous, and to enable the industry to be carried on at full capacity and at the lowest costs;(c) in the United States of America to encourage the production and use of reclaimed rubber and so to diminish the demand of that country for plantation rubber.(v.) With lower prices the production of native rubber and the use of reclaimed rubber are likely to be appreciably checked.(yi.) The disadvantages from which British producers in the restricted areas now suffer will be enhanced in proportion to the length of time for which restriction is continued.(vii.) Any attempt to apply an extended restriction scheme over the whole of the area of the Netherlands East Indies as well as of British Malaya and Ceylon would be neither practicable nor desirable in the interests of British growers, and no useful purpose would be served by again approaching the Dutch Government for their concurrence in any such scheme.(viii.) The Government could not usefully intervene in any negotiations which may be instituted by representatives of the Dutch rubber-growing industry with British producers with the view to the consideration of a selling policy.
(ix.) The effect of an announcement by His Majesty&apos;s Government that restric-tion would be removed at some specified, but comparatively distant, date would probably be (a) that the market, while remaining in some uncertainty, would at once to a large extent discount the effect of removal;(b) that in the meantime demand would be restricted and the price of rubber kept down below the pivotal price for the time being in force;(c) that with prices so reduced the position of British growers, whosecosts would be kept up by continued restriction, would during the intervening period be gravely prejudiced.50.   We therefore recommend That an immediate announcement should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment that all restrictions on the export of rubber from British Malaya and Ceylon will be removed on the 1st November, 1928, the existing scheme being continued unaltered in the meantime.(Signed)HERBERT HAMBLIN (Chairman).

(i.) Scheme for restriction of Rubber Exports recommended in the Supplementary Report, dated October 2nd, 1922, of the Committee appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Investigate and Report on the Rubber Situation in British Colonies and Protectorates (C.M.D. 1756).1. The scheme recommended adopts as the standard production the actual&quot; output of each producer during the 12 months 1st November, 1919, to the 31st October, 1920 amplified in accordance with the suggested Kules contained in Annex A.2. In lieu of existing Export Duties, a minimum export duty is to be levied on that percentage of standard production which is allowed to be exported under this scheme at the minimum rate of duty. The Committee recommend that this minimum be fixed at the lowest possible rate not to exceed Id. per pound.If a producer desires to export a quantity greater than that allowed to be exported at the minimum rate of duty, he shall pay an export duty on his total export during that period of twelve months on the following scale :  ;Duty per pound over all.Not exceeding 65 per cent, of standard production      0   4 Over 65 per cent, but not exceeding 70 per cent.       ...      0   5 ,,   70        ,, ,, ,, 75 ...      0   675       ,, ,, ..      ,, 80    ,, ...      0   7,,   80 ,, ,, 85 ...      0   885       ,, ,, ,,.        90 ...      0   990        ,, ,, 95 ...      0 1095        ,, ,, ,,        100    ,, ...      0 11100       ,,     ... ... ... ... ...      1   0At the initiation of the scheme the percentage exportable at the minimum rate is to be 60.When the rubber situation improves so as to justify allowing an increased percentage of standard production to be exported at the minimum rate of duty the minimum would be substituted in its appropriate place in the scale.3. Alterations in the percentage of standard production would be governed by the price of standard quality smoked sheet in the London market, and it is proposed that, when the average price for such rubber during three consecuthre months has been maintained at not less than Is. 3d. per pound London landed terms, the percentage of production which may be exported at the minimum duty would be raised automatically by 5 for the next ensuing quarter. In the event of such average price being maintained at not less than Is. Qd. per pound, London landed terms, during the whole of three consecutive months, the percentage of production which may be exported at the minimum duty would be raised automatically by 10 for the next ensuing quarter.4. Furthermore, in order that the operation of the scheme may secm-e the desired result, even though for reasons at present unforeseen 60 per cent, of standard production should prove to be too high, the Committee recommend that if during the second quarter after the initiation of the scheme or in any subsequent period of three consecutive months, the price of rubber as hereinbefore defined has not averaged at least Is. per pound, the percentage of standard production that may be exported at the minimum duty shall be reduced to 55, and if that reduction is not effective in raising the average price over the following three months to Is. 2d. then it shall be reduced to 50 at the end of the three months, and so on by reductions of 5 per cent, at the end of each three months until that average price is secured.Once the percentage has been lowered it would not be increased except on the basis of a price of Is. 3d. as aforementioned. If during any quarter when the percentage of standard production that may be exported at the minimum duty is for the tune being fixed at not under 65 per cent, and the price during that quarter has not averaged at least Is. 3d. per pound, the percentage for the ensuing quarter would be reduced by 5.5.   The application of the scheme in their several territories would rest with the local Governments concerned.
6. The Committee recommend that an Advisory Committee be appointed in London for the purposes of co-ordinating the operation of the scheme in Ceylon, Malaya and such other territories as may be involved. They suggest that this Committee should consist of official and non-official members, whose duty would be to advise the Secretary of State on all matters referred to it in connection with the operation of the policy now recommended, and that it should be charged with the responsibility of advising him as to the alterations in the rate of minimum duty required under the scheme.7. The Committee recommend that the Governments of the territories concerned should set up Committees on which there should be representatives of the industry to deal with cases for special consideration in regard to local application of the scheme, and the Committee annex to this Report rules that would require to be observed by these local Committees in the administration of the scheme.S. The Committee cannot conclude this Report without observing that, apart from the financial relief that may be expected to accrue to all rubber producers from the scheme, the discouragement it affords to more drastic tapping, cannot but benefit the estates of those managements who are voluntarily or compulsorily associated with the scheme and leave them ultimately in a stronger position than the estates whose trees have been subjected to tapping on an excessive scale.Annex A to Appendix B (i). Rules for the Guidance of Committees. In issuing certificates of standard production 1. &quot; Standard production &quot; shall be the quantity of dry rubber produced from any holding during the period from the 1st November, 1919, to the 31st October, 1920, provided that if the owner of any holding is unable to declare the output from his holding during that period in the absence of proper records, or if he proves to the satisfaction of the Committee that the output from his holding during that period was abnormal for any of the causes referred to in these Rules, the Committee shall certify some other quantity as the standard production for such holding, in accordance with the rules as set out hereunder.2. If any owner is unable to declare the quantity of rubber produced from his holding during such period, the Committee shall assess the amount to be deemed to be the standard production for that holding, but the quantities so assessed shall not exceed the quantity attained by multiplying the number of acres planted with rubber of each age by the output per acre allotted for trees of each age in accordance with the following table : Maximum Output for 12 Months.Under five years      ... ... ...      Nil.Between five and six years     ... ...      120 poundsBetween six and seven years ... ...      180    .,Between seven and eight years... ...      240    ,,Eight years and over ... ...      3203. If any owner claims that a portion of his holding is planted with trees which were not tapped prior to the 1st November, 1920, he shall be allowed as standard production in addition to his output from the 1st November, 1919, to the 31st October, 1920, an amount calculated according to the table in Rule 2 above.4. If any owner claims that during the period the 1st November, 1919, to the 31st October, 1920, his output was less than his normal output owing to (a.) Lack of labour;(6.) Abnormal ill-health of his labour forces;(c.) Disease of his trees, from which they have since recovered;(d.) Resting of the trees; or(e.) Any other reasonable cause;such addition shall be made to his actual output from the 1st November, 1919, to the 31st October, 1920, for purposes of certification as would, in the opinion of the Committee, equal the loss of output sustained thereby, but in no such case shall the total output for the holding exceed the quantity to which he would have been entitled if he had applied under Rule 2 hereof.
5. If any owner can prove to the satisfaction of the Committee that prior to the commencement of the enactment he has entered into bond fide forward contracts for the sale and delivery of a quantity of rubber in excess of the amount of his normal &quot;standard production &quot; as arrived at under these Rules, diminished by the percent-age of restriction for the time being in force, and that either (a.) Such contract spcciiies that the rubber to be delivered under the contract is rubber from his holding only; or(6.) He is unable to contract on the market to buy in the excess contracted for over the quantity he would be allowed to produce at a price not greater than the price at which he has sold, the Committee may allow him as standard production such quantity as when diminished by the percentage of restriction for the time being in force would allow &apos;him to produce a sufficient quantity to cover his contracts, provided that certificates issued under this Rule may be revised by the Committee at any time when such contracts expire or the percentage of restriction for the time being in force is altered.6. Certificates of &quot;standard production&quot; when issued may not be varied within twelve months of the date of such issue, but on the expiration of such period of twelve months or any subsecpient period of twelve months any owner may apply for revision of the quantity for which his holding has been assessed on the grounds that further areas nave since the issue of the certificate attained the age of five years, and are in a condition to tap. In such case the Committee shall increase the quantity assessed in accordance with the Rules laid down herein.7. If any owner states on his application form that he desires to be assessed at any quantity other than his actual output from the period of the 1st November, 1919, to the 31st October, 1920, and gives his reasons for this request, the Committee shall, before issuing any certificate, notify such owner of the quantity at which the Committee propose to assess him, and inform him that in the event of his objecting to such assessment he must state his case personally or by his representative or by letter at a specified time and place.(ii.) Supplementary Regulations issued hg Colonial Office on October 25, 1926.As from the 1st November, the export of rubber from Ceylon and Malaya will be subject to the following regulations. It is not contemplated that any change shall be made in these regulations for a period of 12 months at least, but if it is decided at the end of that time to continue the temporary policy of restriction for a further period, any changes iu the regulations which may then be considered desirable may be made : 1. If the average price of rubber in London is less than one shilling and nine pence a pound but not less than one shilling and three pence a pound during any quarter, the percentage of standard production which may be exported at the minimum rate of duty for the ensuing quarter will be reduced by 10. If, however, the reduction to be effected under this regulation is a reduction from a figure of 100 per cent, the reduced percentage for the ensuing quarter will be SO.2. If such average price for any quarter is not less than one shilling and nine pence a pound but less than two shillings a pound, there will be no change in the percentage for the ensuing quarter. If, however, in each of three successive quarters stich average price is not less than one shilling and nine pence a pound, the percentage for the ensiling quarter will be increased by 10.3. If such average price for any quarter is two shillings a pound or over, the percentage will bo increased by 10 for the ensuing quarter. If, however, the increase to be effected under this regulation is an increase from a figure of 80 per cent., the increased percentage for the ensuing quarter will be 100.4. If such average price is below one shilling and three pence a pound in any quarter, the percentage will be reduced to 60 for the ensuing quarter.5. If such average price is over three shillings iu any quarter, the percentage will be iucreased to 100 for the ensuing quarter.G. In no case will the percentage be increased above a figure of 100 or decreased below a figure of 60.

Sclieme submitted by the Rubber Gi-oicers&apos; Association.It is submitted that the permanent interests of the Producing Industry now require that the principal objectives of any modification of the Restriction Scheme and Regulations should be to bring about as soon as possible an approximate equilibrium between the supply of and demand for Crude Plantation Rubber and the maintenance of the pivotal price in force for the time being with as slight fluctuations as possible.With these objectives in view the following modifications are suggested : 1. That the Rules regulating the basis of assessments and the export of rubber shall be brought into uniformity in Malaya and Ceylon as soon as possible, such Rules not to be varied except by mutual arrangement between Malaya and Ceylou, and any variation to take effect simultaneously in both countries.2!. That the pivotal price shall be Is. tid. as from the 1st November, 1928, Is. 3d. as from the 1st November, 1929, and Is. as from the 1st November, 1930.3. That if at the end of the month of November, 1928, or at the end of auy subsequent month the average price of rubber for such month has (a) risen above the average price for the previous month and (6) exceeded the pivotal price by Id. (but by less than 3d.) the exportable percentage for the ensuing month shall be increased by 10:but, if the price has so risen and the excess has been 3d. (but less than Gd.) by 20and, if the price has so risen and the excess has been (kl. (or more) by 30.
If at the end of the month of November, 1928, or at the end of any subsequent month (a) the average price for such month has fallen below the average price for the previous month, and(6) has been below the pivotal price by less than \d. the exportable percentage for the ensuing month shall be decreased by 10 ;and, if the price has so fallen and the average price for such month is a id. (or more) below the pivotal price the exportable percentage for the enauing month shall be decreased by 20but, if the average price for such month has been less than the pivotal price but more than the average price for the previous month, the exportable percentage for the ensuing month shall be decreased by lu only.Provided always that if at the end of any such month the average price of rubber has not changed so as to justify an increase or decrease of exportable percentage in pursuance of the terms of this rule no change shall be made in the exportable percentage for the ensuing month.4. That Rule 3 shall be subject to a maximum percentage of release of 100 per cent of standard production.5. As there are practical difficulties in the way of issuing coupons monthly to the small local producers but it is very desirable that the monthly ehauge of exportable percentage should be made immediately to apply to coupon, as well as licence, holders it is suggested : (a) that the coupons issued each quarter to the local producers entitled thereto shall be of three different classes, one class for each of the ensuing three months(o) coupons of each class shall be issued for one-twelfth of standard assessments but the export value of each coupon shall depend upon the exportable percentage proclaimed for the month in respect of which it is issued(c) the month to which each of the coupons relate shall be clearly distinguished by printing in large type thereon the particular month and year for which it is issued and/or by the use of different coloured inks and papers for each month and/or in other ways as may be thought convenient by the local authorities.0.
