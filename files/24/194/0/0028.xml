COHFIDEIITIAL.11R. HACKING, in taking the Chair, expressed to the Council the apologies of thG President for hie absence.   H6 was to attend the funeral service of the late Lord Cave that morning and immediately afterwards was due at a Cabinet meeting.    In those circumstances he had asked Mr. Hacking to preside over the meeting of the Advisory Council.COAL.iiH. 7/AHIAii reported that the weekly output in the United Kingdom for the three weeks ended ilareh 17th had gone back a littlo.    In each week it had been sLightly under the 5 million tons mark and was about        of the iiarch 1925 weekly average basis which had been taken as a standard-   The quantity oi coal exported in February had been 4,C07,631 tons as compared with 3,904,700 tons in January.     The value f.o.b. was exactly the same as in January, namely 15/9d per ton. The exports showed rather a curious phase in certain directions.    Scandinavia had become less and less, practically every month, a market for our coal;    it took as little as 233,000 tons in Pebruarjr as compared with a monthly average in 1913 of 825,000 tons and in J/Itrch 1927 485,000 tons. The reduction was, of course, owing to Polish competition.The British coal trade was still under a certain handicap owing to the restrictions of foreign Governments, and was feeling particularly at the present moment the effects of the licensing system in Germany.       It might perhaps be in order to ask what conditions were imposed v/hen that arrangement was made.    British exporters had been given to understand that the restrictions that were about to be put on would not really interfere with their trade, but in fact they only exported to Germany last year 4t million tons of coal against 9 million ton3 in 1913-     iir. Tiarbam^ company did a considerable trade with Germany, but their agents had not been able to get a licence for the coal sold to them.      At the same time, the Eritish oompanj&apos;- could not get them to make a statement positively to that effect because they said that if they did so they would get into bad odour with their Government, and their licences would be still further restricted.GOIHiODOiS KING asked whether any suggestion of unfair treatment, or a refusal of licences had been made, because the Plines Department had not so far been able to trace any oases where difficulties had been put in the way of our trade, and therefore it looked as if tho demand was falling oil.
COAL (COETD. )iiR. v/lRHAiC promised to make further inquiries.With regard to selling organisations in this country, none of these had yat been fully established, but the iiidland Association was beginning its operations, and Sootland had also made a beginning but had not yet arranged for the stoppage of the selected pits which wars the essential factor of the a scheme.   The difficulty of fixing minimum prices for the various grades of Welsh ooal had so far prevented the Welsh schema of oontrol of prices coming into action.   There were now only two largo ooal fields whioh had not adopted some sort of sales organisation.     Northumberland had drawn up a system of minimum prices for export ooal, and was now considering the adoption of a scheme similar to that proposed for South wales. Durham, with so much of its market depending upon export and the supply of fuel to the depressed iron and steel trade, had not so far been able to evolve any satisfactory plan of oombination.In Northumberland and Durham the arbitrators award giving a reduction in wages had been loyally accepted by the trade unions, hut a considerable amount of trouble had been caused by the- action of young men and boys under the influence of the minority movement.   A considerable loss of output had been oaused by this, and to a certain extent the difficulty was still going on.     But the collieries had received support right through frsm the trade union leaders in both those districts.Generally, the trade position had become just slightly better than it was e month ago.&amp;R. AL3XAND5R SHAW, referring to what Mr. Warham had said in respect of Polish competition in the Scandinavian market, remarked that perhaps there was another cause contributory to the falling off of ooal exports from here, namely that the Scandinavians more than any other country had gone in for Diesel ships.       The vessels they sent to Australia and whioh oarried an enormous amount of wool and other produoe, were almo6t entirely Diesel ships, and they were rapidly giving up the running of coal-driven vessels.IRON AND ST23L.IIR.BOND said that the more optimistic tone in iron and steel circles, to which he drew attention in last month&apos;s report, appeared to be justified by the figures of production for February.     Those showed that steel production had increased from 686,200 tons in January to 764,400 tons in February, a very substantial increase especially when the shorter working month was taken into account.     While the production of pig iron in February as a whole did not register an absolute inoreasa over January, falling in fact from 560,500   tons in January to 550,800 tons in February, yet the daily production in February was slightly higher than in January.    Imports of iron and steel, on the other hand, had showed no diminution and amounted to 236,900 tons oompared with 283,900 tons in January.   It was probable that some of this material was on
CONFIL;!7?! AL.IROIi AKL ST ELL (C02IT D.)old contracts and that the karch figures might show a decline. Exports of iron and steel in February amounted to 317,000 tons which was lower than in any month since February 1927.Unfortunately, except in pig iron, the increase in continental prices was not sustained, and there had been a oontinual tendency towards lower prices, although prioes had not yet reverted to the level from which the advance started. Tho brightest feature in the situation was the firmness of Cleveland pig iron; the increase of l/- per con made last month had been held and prices were firm.    Consumption was now fully equal to production end in a few waeks new furnaces might hare to be blown in.   iJot only was foreign iron kept out of the Tees, but Cleveland iron was now replacing foreign iron in Scotland, although Scotland was still importing foreign iron on old contracts.The hematite pig iron trade was in a much less enviable position than the Cleveland, iron troio, but part of the difficulties was duo to interr.?.l competition.   Production of hematite had recently been curtailed, but there were sti3.1 stocks to dispose of.   &quot;he strike of ore minors in Sweden, while increasing the prices of Spanish ore to British consumers, had. increased, prices to Belgium and Germany to an even greater extent, as those countries were more heavily committed to Swedish ore end had not running contracts with Spanish and North African mines to the same extent as British firms.The position in the steel trade was far from satisfactory; semi-finished and finished foreign material was now again being offered for early delivery at prices considerably below British. Belgian prices, f.o.b. Ar-twerp, for merchant bars, whioh had risen from  4.16.6d per ton to  5.7-Od. per ton between the beginning of the year end the end of February, had been consistently falling in the last few weeks and at iilarch 28th were  5.4.6d. per ton.    Girders rose from  4.7.0d. per ton to  4.15.0d. per ton in the same period and had declined to  4.13.04. per ton.       Concessions were made on large quantities and it was this   price weakness which was causing purchasers to hold back,and made the position so unsatisfactory. The demand for structural steel continued good.     The galvanised sheet trade was not satisfactory.   Tinplate business continued to improve and makers wore fairly well booked for extended delivery.    The trade was still only working 75/- of capacity, but prices ware firm with a rising tendency.     With increasing activity in the steel industry in South Wales the increased demand for scrap v/a3 creating some difficulty owing to the hoavy shipments of scrap from this country, cspeoially to Germany.    As a result, the cost of steel in South Wales was advancing.In all districts operations were restricted, but in some nroas the dulneas was thought to be partly soaoonal and business might revive aftor Easter.    Generally, it must be admitted that the position of the heavy steel trade was still
IftUd AiiiJ Si&apos;;^Ji (CulifD.).dominated by Continental competitive conditions and production in this country only received a stimulus when Continental works were woll booked forward.   With the growing capacity on the Continent (for example the ucrman Steel Trust was extending uambom works to a total capacity of 2^- million tons of steel per annum, equal to the total production of Luxemburg), these periods of relative congestion must become less frequent, iho fact must be faced that ur:dor existing economic disparities between thic country and the Continent there was no foundation on which to base a constructive policy for the British heavy steel industry.Slit AhTnUh BALit&apos;uUk thought that the Sheffield trades, taking the three months of the year as a whole, were about equal to what they were in th6 corresponding part of last year.    There waB nothing very bright about them except that in the last sixX\\\\\\
9i ftht jl UCOIWIDJOTIAL.STEEL (COUTD. )weeks much better qualities of material had been ordered from Sheffield.   People were coming back to quality more than they had done in the last two or three years, which was a very good eign, and Sheffield was beginning to get back its trade in the really high class steels.   The same seemed to apply to tools. Generally, it might be expected that the months of April and Lay would probably.ly be a littlo bettor in turnover, judging from tho orders already received, than the earlier months.IT01T-PERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD wrote:-&quot;I write to report that there is little in the way of fresh development to record since the Council last met. Conditions in the metal markets are quiet, but I think the indications generally are that the volume of consumption is being maintained, and, as I see the prospects for the near future, they appear to be moderately encouraging&quot;.LNGIILLLRI1TG.SIR E. PSTT3R considered that general engineering was just holding its own.   Most of the large contracts coming to this country were in the electrical section, and there were not very many of importance to report in generel engineering at the present time.    The exports of machinery in February totalled 43,617 tons as against 50,176 tons in January, and imports of machinery amounted to 7,5 3 tons as against 8,246.      Of course, February being a short month accounted for some of the difference.      In these figures the average value per ton of exports fall from  95.7 in January to  93.3 in February, and that seemed to confirm that the greater portion of the business in manufacturing engineering was being obtained at very low prices with very little profit.   The level of unemployment over all trades in tha country showod a slight decline in February as compared with January, but, in some of the smeller branches of the engineering industry there was actually a rise, though in the engineering industry as a whole it remained virtually unchanged.   The trade and employment statistics seemed to show a slight setback in the activity of the industry, but there was no reason to assume that this reflected more than a temporary phase, while seasonal conditions would soon bring about an improvement.     Engineering had benefited by the industrial truce of recant months.     At the present moment thore was a demand for an increase in wages; that was now undor consideration and must be for the moment a disturbing influence.
213   -BIIGIKSBRING ( CON TP. ) .Sir     letter emphasised what k&apos;r.Bond had said in regard to continental competition (see section on Iron and Steel). In secondary engineering, perhaps even more than in the primary industries, while such different wage conditions continued on the Continent, it was difficult to see how we were going to get better conditions in engineering here.    He instanced the state of affairs in the manufacture of sanitary ware, an industry which was perhaps not strictly engineering, but which had during the last few months encountered extraordinary competition from the Continent, and from Belgium in particular. The comparison of home and continental wages in that industry was most startling, and at the moment they wero utterly unable to obtain contracts against continental competition.    TYith the present demand for a wages increase this situation would become more acute and very difficult indeed to meet under present conditions.UK. itfCBMOKD regretted that it was not possible to recora any improvement in marine engineering throughout the country, and completion of work in hand was being reached without fresh orders taking its place.    Tho dearth of marine orders, in fact, was compelling seme firms to try to secure contracts for land power units - a market in which already there was very severe competition,  both home and continental.    The Tyne and Clyde had both done fairly well in the distribution of the Admiralty programme.    0x&quot;ders for the turbines for the light cruiser to be built at Devonport,  the flotilla leader, and two destroyers, had gone to the Tyne, and four destroyers to the Clyde.    On the Clyde the output ox vessels had been a record for the first quarter of the year,  41 vessels of 162,897 tons having been launched,  but very little replacement work had come to hand.The demand for engine economy was causing, owners to consider the conversion of their reciprocating vessels to tho Bauer-Wach system, whereby an additional small exhaust turbine geared on the main shaft utilised the exhaust steam subsequent to its use in the reciprocating engine.    A few of these conversions were now in progress,  and a number in contomrlation.    The hard facts were that all the technical advances being made involved much heavier initial capital expenditure and, coupled with the large amount of tonnage still idle and poor freights, caused reluctance in placing ordinary merchant vessels.    Shipbuilders and engineers could therefore only hope for vessels oC special type being required, and for these there were a few enquiries about.With regard to the wages question, a joint oonference between the engineering trades unions and the engineering employers&apos; federation had been held in London on 15th March at which the case for an advance of 10/- was presented by Mr.Brownlie for the trade unions;  and the federation were taking the opinion of their constituent branches on the questioi-G-
51: GIN RARING (CONTD. ) .and would meet the trade unions again on the last week in April.    The unemployment figures of the industry remained practically stationary.    General engineering in Scotland was maintaining its position.    In the locomotive industry, there was a fair amount of work, the motor vehicle firms were busy and constructional engineers well employed.MR. ALEXANDER SHAW observed that in regard to the Bauer-T.;ach system, there existed a certain amount of dubiety in the minds of shipowners.    It involved a single or double reduc-tion gear turbine and, to put it not too strongly, the experience of shipowners no to double reduction gears in the past had not been invariably satisfactory.    They were tending to look rather to the use of a turbine in some convenient position in the engine room taking the exhaust steam from the -third or fourth cylinder as the case might be, and driving a generator which provided alternating current direct lor a motor in the turning shaft.    It was stated by experts that the loss in this double conversion would be no more than the loss in the gear, while it vrould save a strain on the greater part of the shafting.    The question of that strain was understood to be receiving the consideration of the Board of Trade, and where such conversions were made they were rendered he was not cOEiplaining of it at ail,  it probably was perfectly right - they were rendered far more expensive than they otherwise would be by the requirement that the shafting should be replaced by stronger shafting to meet the increased strain. The electrical drive to some extent would aipear to get over that.    It would be much less noisy and there -would be much less vibration by that system.ELECT RIGA! INDUSTRIES.SIR PKILIF NASH observed that a survey of the electrical industry during the three months just ended showed that the amount of business placed was somewhat greater than in the corresponding period of last year.    In the heavy central power station and power house section there was more activity than there had been for some time.    That was due to the fact that the Central Electricity Board&apos;s schemes for Scotland and the London area had been published and sanctioned, and a third scheme,  for central England, had been published and was still under consideration.    There was some improvement also in the lighter products, and the three months had shown an increasing demand from industry generally for the lighter forms of electrical plant.    This increased activity in the home market had, however, attracted a considerable continental competition, particularly from Switzerland and Sweden, both of which countries were slack in their own home markets and were looking for business in Great Britain.
ELS0TRI0x\L INDUSTRIES  (CONTD.) .In the export field there had been no great ohange, and Great 3ritain was getting her share of the business. For the last two years we had been the largest exporters of electrical plant in the worldj this year&apos;s figures would show no particular change in that direction.    Ab regards cables, January and February ware slack, but that was seasonal.   The ordere placed in ^arch, last month, were quite up to the standard, and the oable industry was at the moment well occupied.COTTON.SIR KENNETH STEWART reported that on the distributing side of the cotton trade the month had been very patchy. It waB rather slack at the opening, improved very considerably towards the middle of the month, and then fell off a good deal towards the end.   Especially towards the middle of the month China had been buying plain staples with some freedom and some of the smaller Far Eastern markets were ordering goods.   West Africa and South America had been generally quiet, but the tone was generally good and that more or Iobb went on into the second or third week of the month.   From then onwards business had become pretty slack.   There was enquiry but a good deal of hesitation, because there was a rise in the price of ootton, especially in Egyptian cotton, which the market generally did not believe in.   The markets abroad were showing a certain loss of confidence in the present prices, but it was believed that if some of this confidence were restored there was a good deal of business ready to be placed.The cotton trade had been very much interested in the aebate in the House of Commons on 2nd April, and he understood that the general feeling in Manchester waB that the Government!b attitude on the subject was one which would be very muoh approved.    He did not think the cotton trade was in the least soared of any enquiry, public or otherwise, but Beeing that so muoh of the business was done in face of foreign competition  it was a little difficult to know what advantage a public enquiry could have.    If it produced anything ooncrete it would warn competitors of what was proposed to be done.   There were certainly a great many reforms which ought to be undertaken in lancashire in order to put the industry In a position to compete, and they were already doing their beet to co-operate for that purpose.
2iiWOOL.Mix. AYKROYD wrote&quot;The position of the woollen and worsted trade shews very little change since our last meeting&quot;.MR. ARTHUR SHAW wrote&quot;There is very little to report.   The position is very similar to last month, and it is a pleasing&apos; feature that the Improvement in the Bradford district has been fully maintained.   The number signing our Vacant Book at the present time is the lowest for an extended period, and the percentage has deoreased as follows:-March 7th......... 5.01&quot;    14 th.......... 4.29&quot;    21st.......... 3.88&quot;    28th.......... 3.91On Maroh 30th, 1927, the figure was 10.46.&quot;I am also happy to report that in the heavy woollen district there has been a decided improvement, and this applies particularly to the Batley, Dewsbury and leadon districts.   The numbers signing our books declined during the month as follows:-March 7th........... 16.85&quot;    14th........... 16.12&quot;    21st........... 14.14&quot;    28th........... 13.77&quot;No change is reported from the Kuddersfield and Halifax area, and although the number signing tho Vacant Book has increased very slightly during the month, trade In , these distriots has been very steady for a conBidorable period.&quot;CHEMICALS.MR.    0.A Hill said that the chemical industry during the month had been comparatively uneventful with nothing to report except steady improvement in market conditions and a fairly active export trade.Rather more than a year ago the Association of British Chemical kanufacturers prepared at very short notice a memorandum on the chemical industry of Great Britain for the
CONFIDENTIAL.CnSlilCALS  (COMDD.).Economic Conference convened by the League of Nations. They had now been invited to prepare a further document bringing the earlier one up to date.    In this connection they had been confronted on each occasion with difficulties arising from an absence of the necessary statistics.     The 1924 census of production figures were available, but they did not provide all tho data required for the chemical industry.   His association was attempting to remedy this position and they had already got a scheme working for the tar distillation industry, and hoped to get schemes for other sections of the industry as well.The annual statistics for what was perhaps the most important chemical manufacture, that is sulphuric acid, were now available.   The interesting figure was the percentage of available plant which, had been actually working and this figure for the last eight years was as follows:-Year. Percentage,-1920.............. 75 c 31921 .............. 38.81922 ............ 58-01925 .............. 62.11924 .............. 6*. 51925 .............. 59.01926 .............. 49.51oq7 ao   a[    .............. . ^The table showed the effect of the rise and fall in general trsdo and the coal dispute.   Of the raw raaterials from which sulphuric acid was manufaetured during 1927 25/.- was made fro^ home-produced raw materials, and 75,-i from imported ra\/ materials.    Intimately connected with the sulphuric acid industry was the superphosphate industry which showed continued and increasing depression.     An important percentage of superphosphate was imported from abroad - about 25;i - and foreign superphosphate was being freely offered in large quantities, c.i.f., U.K. ports, round about 40/- per ton, which figure was several shillings below tho cost- of production in this country.   The low price of the imported material was to be explained partly by the surplus production in Belgium of &quot;zinc acid&quot;, which was used up in producing superphosphate, and in that way the Belgians 7/ere able to dump it in this country.     The continued existence of superphosphate manufacture here was seriously threatenod, as it had ceased to earn profits now for several years.
GAS INDUSTRY.SIR DAVID dlLNE-WATSON had practically nothing fresh to report with regard to the position of the gas industry.    Gas sales were well maintained.     The residual market remained very much as it had been.   The market for gas coke was good, considering the competition.    Other prices remained stable.There had been a rise in the price of pitch which this country exported largely; that was due to the producers coming together and not actually making a close arrangement with regard to price, but not competing quite so keenly, dividing the markets between them.   Pitch was also produced in Germany.   Road tar was meeting with a great deal of competition from bitumen.   The oil companies were competing against each other, and this was lowering the prices of every road tar.    It was some consolation to know that tar was holding its own for road dressing, and apparently was preferred by many local Councils for the dressing of the roads instead of imported bitumen.MR. HILL thought it would be agreed that the improvement in the technique of road laying had kept pace -with the increased use of roads in thiB country,    in the past few months the British Road Tar Association had been formed as a body representative of the producers of this important raw material.    The Association of British Chemical lianufacturers represented the tar distillers, the gas companies and the coke oven industry, and therefore brought in all the interests engaged in producing the road tar of the requisite quality.RUBBER.HR. JOHNSTON stated that the position of the rubber manufacturing industry remained on the whole fairly satis-factory.    The tyre branch was a little dull owing to the poor -eather we had experienced lately, which had to some extent affected the car manufacturing industry, but this would no doubt be rectified in later months if the weather improved. The rubber footwear section was still   -busy, as although summer goods had been slow, owing again to the unpromising weather, the demand for winter foof /ear continued for the same reason much later than usual.      This was practically the only country in which rubber &quot;Wellington boots were used by women and young people.    In ether countries they were used purely for industrial purposes.    Naturally, the development of the trade in those boots had brought a great increase in imports from America and Canada.    7e could not export them because the articles were not used in any other country to the same extent.
COSFIDEHTIAL. RU33ER    (CONTD.).In (eneral goods the demand appeared to be about normal,  /hilst production of goods   for engineering pur poser-ms above tlie average, which rather indicated either present or coming general industrial activity.    Export trade was improving both to the Dominions and to Continental markets.    Prices -/ere keen but the increasing stability of the exchanges was undoubtedly exercising a beneficial effect on foreign business.    Employment continued good, many sections working a certain amount of overtime.On the  rhole, but for the feeling of uncertainty regarding tho probable course of the crude rubber market, which prevented manufacturers from planning and selling ahead, the outlook was distinctly good.POOD INDUSTRIES.sulphuric STANLEY MACHIN wrote:-&quot;So far as my information goes, the position has not materially changed since  re last met.    Although it is slow, progress is being made and hopeful confidence &quot;is in the ascendant.      Pood Indiistrieo continue to do a fair trade, although the policy of the retailers to keep stocks very low anc;. rely upon more frequent deliveries from the manu-facturers and suppliers, adds to the expense of business at the present time.    You may remember Sir J^siah Stamp at our last meeting referred oo the extra labour and cost to the railways in consequence of the greatly increased delivery of small consignments.   This is a matter which rests with the retailers and over which the manufacturers have little or no control.&quot;The near approach of the budget is having the usual unsettling effect upon the markets where dutiable articles are concerned.    Thif; is being, specially felt in sugar.    As you are possibly aware, for some time p^rt this important article hao been imported at prices below the coot of production.    The Czecho-slovakians were one of the \rorst dumpers, but they appear to have got tired of tho process and the result of the limitation of shipments vhich have been arranged at the instigation of the Cuban suppliers is likely to be felt in the near future, in the forn of increased prices.&quot;The export trade is being maintained on a steady basis.    Tho outlook in China appears more hopeful, and 7e are receiving encouraging reports as to the outlook in Canada.    In other markets of the Empire, especially India, 7o are still looking for increased demand.   The Continental trade remains unsatinfactory.    The increased tariffs have made business in many markets, especially France and 3elgium, almost impossible.    I am having complaints of financial difficulties in Portugal, which for the time being are certain to Interfere /1th the regular course of buoiheon in this country&quot;.
a^ a confidential. GENERAL TR\PE.MR GILBERT VYLE thought that the trade of tho country-generally seemed to be very well maintained and on the whole there was not very much change, except that in March one generally expected to be a little busier than in, say, January.      In Leicester manufacturers of boots and shoes of all kinds continued to be busy.     In the hosiery trade export was fairly good, but the home trade was bad.     From Nottingham there were still favourable reports of the condition of the lace trade, and it appeared that the old fashioned long curtains were coming into favour again, for which they were very grateful.     A great variety of novelty goods had been produced.     In the making-up trade the position was much better than that recorded a month ago, and there was every indication that the staff and the machinery would be well employed.In the hosiery trade they appeared to be a little better off, although in woollen articles business would become restricted as a result of the extremely high prices obtained at the London wool sales.      At Widnes the chemical trade and copper trade were steady.From Liverpool It was reported that South American meat v/as still cheap enough to depress  ths New Zealand and Australian trade, even in lambs.      In leather the difficulty was that prices had risen so much that leather buyers had held off and so brought about a slight reduction, hut now Russia, Germany and America had all come into the market and prices had again taken an upward turn.     That might have some influence upon our trade.      The timber trade showed a fair improvement over the two preceding months.      A large quantity had gone into consumption and the imports had not been excessive.      It looked as if there were going to be higher prices, especially from Sweden where they had a lock out in the timber mills.International Chamber of Commerce.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR stated that he had just come back with Mr. Gilbert Vyle from Paris from the meeting of the Inter-national Chamber of Commerce Council in Paris, and the President, M.  Pirelli, had made a very able statement on worm economic conditions in 1927.      Sir Arthur had to speak after M. Clementel, and he pointed out to the representatives of the 45 nations who were assembled there that while the nations had been to Geneva and had taken part in the Economic Conference and laid down the basis of a scheme on which the world&apos;s international trade could be improved, Great Britain still had one million people unemployed, and that there was a growing feeling in this country that if we did not get some real   reciprocity and   get it&apos;fairly soon, it would be very difficult to know
*M 0GSN3RAL TRAPS (contd).International Chamber of Cjr^er 1e.J    n till *what might happen.      Public opinion here was not satisfied with the way in which wo had been treated in other countries. It was to be hoped that that wont home to thorn.As an Instance of treatment about which we night rightly complain, tho French on 14th &quot;torch altered their tariff on alloys and many otlnr things.      They put the tariff on alloys up by 15$?;    they printed the statement on 14th and put it into operation on 19+h.      That did not give anyone a chance to finish contracts, and such a sudden alteration of duties completely put this country out of business as regards alloys in France.MR. VYLE mentioned that at the meeting of the Inter-national Chamber the Convention for the abolition of import and export prohibitions and restrictions came in for a good deal of adverse criticism, largely on the ground that the reservations made It of little value.      He thought, however, the discussions were not exactly a waste of time because the atmosphere created by representatives of different countries, including Americans, meeting together, helped to smooth out many small difficulties and create an atmosphere of greater tolerance all round.SIR SYDNEY CHAPMAN pointed out, with regard to the reservations to the Prohibitions Convention, that it was true that a long list of reservations had been put in, but there was to be another meeting In June to consider them.Co-operative Wholesale Society.MR HAYHURST reported that In the month just closed the Society&apos;s sales had increased by about 6-g- per cent over the corresponding period last year,     Tho nine weeks of &quot;this current financial year also showed an increase, except in South T&apos;ales where there was a slight decrease on account of the unfortunate depression in that district.      Their trade figures for tho financial year of 1927 showed sales totalling 87 millions, an increase of 15 per cent ov^r 1926. As regards provisions,  they were doing a larpe trade in&apos; Danish buttor and wished that moro of the trade was done in the Empire.      Sugar had recently advanced in price and buyors appeared a little reluctant to book ahead in view of the forthcoming budget,.      Tho driod fruit trade had shown a steady improvement, msdium and lower grade qualities being mostly in demand.     Furniture, drapery and boots and shoes
hJ l-j 1/GENERAL TRACE (contd).Co-operative Tfaolesale Society (contd).had shown increased sales.     The Society had had a phenomenal increase in trade in tea, and prices had been fairly moderate. The British combine had bought Heavilyof the &apos;Vest African cocoa crop and had had to release part, with the result that prices had become easier.      Individual banking deposits were considerably higher, and it was encouraging to know that, in a time of bad tra^e generally, there had been some thrift among a very large proportion of the population.FINANCE AND BANKING.MR. CUR RLE wrote: -&quot;A firm tone has characterised the market for government securities during the past month, and this has been accentuated by the publication of the Revenue returns at the end of the quarter.      There has also been considerable activity in speculative securities.      New issues have been plentiful, and these seem likely to increase still further after Easter.&quot;The three months&apos; bill rate has fallen quite onthe expectation of easier monetary conditions in the near future;   but it is by no means certain that this expectation will be realised.&quot;SEIPPItrr.MR.  ALEXANDER SHAW observed that the freight Index figure was unduly low for this time of year.    The February figure, as compared with 100 in 1920, was 24.5.      In February last year it had been 31.18.      If ono compared these figures with the 1913 index instead&apos; of that for 1920,  taking the 1913 freight figure as 100, the present February figure would be 104,7., It was believed that that figure,  to be remunerative, should be in the neighbourhood of 160 for cargo vessels and 200 for liners.      That was taking into account necessary depreciation and the higher cost of building as well as the higher cost of running the steamers.      The slipping back of the freight rate at this time of year no doubt accounted for what had bean said by Mr. Richmond (see under &quot;Engineering&quot;) as to tha slowness of shipowners to place further orders, because their recent optimism which had resulted in a large increase in shipbuilding had not so far bo-en justified by events.
9n afj i. xRAILWAY TRAFFIC.SIR JOSIAH STAMP observed that there was general agreement . in the reports of the four main Railway Companies.   They still found the movement of trade extremely irregular, and the improvements they got in one direction were almost immediately counterbalanced by something less satisfactory elsewhere, so that ih the aggregate trade continued rather below the level of previous years and below what had been expected.     It could not be said that, after weighing carefully the available information, there was enough to enable a very optimistic view for the immediate future to be expressed.   There might be some expansion of business in the next two rr three months, but not a very great one.     In almost all directions, except electrical engineering, there seemed to be a d-isfnclina-tion to place orders far ahead, or on any large soalo, and generally speaking purchasers were adhering to a policy of hand to mouth requirements.     It was in the trades producing the heavy tonnages for conveyance that unemployment had been more prevalent lately even than in 1927.The traffic receipts for tne groups as a whole could be summarised as follows - traffic receipts for merchandise 4% down for the 12 weeks to March 25th last as compared with the previous year;    for coal and coke 10$ down;    total traffic receipts 6% down.     The 10% decrease in respect of coal was very differently shared by the companies - viz:   it was 12.1$ in the case of the L.M.S., 6% for the L.N.E., and 12.3$ for the G.W.     Of course it was to be borne in mind that the first six weeks, at least, of the 12 weeks&apos; period had certuinly been abnormal in&quot;1927.     In household coal there was no marked indication of changed conditions either in quantities or flow of traffic, and the industrial demand for fuel remained depressed, and was still   below &quot;what might be regarded as normal.     Taking things as a whole, the industrial sit\xation was so extraordinarily patchy that it was very hard to arrive at a due balance, on which to form a judgment.MR, R.H. HILL stated that, in comparing the receipts of the railways during the first three months of this&quot;year with those for the corresponding period of 1927, it had to be borne in mind that comparisons were very much affected, so far as 1927 was concerned, by the aftermath of the coal strike and also by the fact that railway rates were increased by something like 6-^ in February 1927.     During the four weeks ended 25th March last the decrease in railway receipts compared with, the corresponding period of 1927 amounted roughly to  660,000.     For the 12 weeks ended 25th March the decrease amounted to nearly  if millions. An analysis of&quot;those figures showed that ^jung January and february of this year more than half the decrease was in coal receipts, but during March the falling off&quot;of the coal receipts was very much less marked.     There was, however, a considerably greater reduotion of receipts from other merchandise.Railway statistics were available for January,     The new standard charges came into operation on the 1st January and, concurrently, certain alterations were made in the
RAILWAY TRAPFIO (CJIITD).compilation of statistics, the result being that comparisons could not in all cases be made with 1927.    In particular a new list of commodity lioadinga had been adopted and no comparative figures for 1927 were a3 yet available.    Generaly speaking, the statistics for January showed that, so far as passenger traffic wa3 concerned, there had been an increase in the amount of cheap ticket travel, but that did not mean a net increase in passenger receipts.    The tonnage of freight conveyed decreased by 1^ million tons or about 5-5 per cent, compared with January 1927.    Of that decrease over 900,000 tons was accounted for by coal.EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS reported that during March the unemployment figures followed a normal course and fell by about 75,000 between February 27th and March 2Cth, the total at the latter date being just over 1,033,000.   he handed in the following table showing the estimated number of insured persons in employment, as distinct from those unemployed.

0 90fv. u tjOOHPIDBHIIAL.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SA1JDERS01T stated that since his last report about Australia there had been further good rains, and although in portions of Queensland there was still anxiety about the winter, the dry portions of New South Wales had got much needed relief, and generally speaking, the prospects were favourable. In regard to wheat,  sales had been freely made and about one half of the exportable surplus had been shipped.   Tho wool selling season was practically over and the outlook for the next wool clip was quite favourable, but some very heavy losses of stock occurred after last shearing and this might affoct the next clip.    In dried fruits, fifteen per cent of the production had been fixed by the State Boards for local consumption in three of the States end there would probably be a large surplus for export.      The export bounty on wine was being discussed v/ith a view to reduction.       Prices for hides had edvanced very considerably end sales had been freeljr made, and that would be to the benefit of the cattle industry which had been suffering so much of recent years.     The financial egreement between the Commonwealth and the States had now been ratified by the Commonwealth Government and by four out of the six States.Seme rather striking industrial developments bed occurred in Australia during the lest few months.     Mr. Amery had already made a statement regarding the mission which was being sent out to confer with the Government and various bodies cut there *       The terms of reference were - &quot;tn confer with the Commonwealth and State Governments, v/ith the Development and Migration Commission, end with leaders of industry and commerce in Australia, on.the development cf Australian resources end on any other matters cf mutual interest to Great Britain and the Commonwealth which may tend to the promotion of trade between the two countries and the increase of settlemer-t in Australia&quot;.      It was understood that the mission was to leave in -August.     Then, it was stated that negotiations were proceeding for the introduction of  2,000,000 of German capital into i!ew South Wales for exploiting the coalfields and by-products;    Nobels had approved a plan for a factory in Melbourne for the menufecture of leather cloth, and had also been making considerable developments in regard to the chemical industries;    Dorman Long and Baldwins had joined with two Australian firms in regard to the erection ef very large steel works at Pert Kemle;    Stewarts &amp; Lloyds would shortly be erecting at Newcastle a  1,000,000 plant for the manufacture of steel tubes and pipes;    the Rapson Tyre Company were building in Tasmania a factory to employ eventually two thousand men; the Davis Gelatine Company proposed to erect a factory in Melbourne;    the Rubicon Eydro-Llectric scheme which would supply north eastern Victoria, was completed;     and the Australian Paper mills had recently installed a large paper-making plant in Melbourne costing  190,000.INDIAN TRADM.MR-GORDON said that, except in the cotton industry,economic conditions in India continued to be generally satisfactory.
INDIAN trade (CONTD. )The balanoe of trade for the month of February had been in favour of India by 580 lakhs against 470 lakhs in the corresponding months of last year. i.e., an improvement of 109 lakhs.     Indications still showed that internal trade ?/as brisk.     For the week ending 18th B&apos;ebruary the gross earnings of the railways were four lakhs in exoeeo of the figure for the corresponding week of February 1927, while the total gross earnings from the beginning of the financial year to the end of the same week had been 370 lakhs in excess of those during the corresponding period a year ago.The total visible balance of trade in favour of India for the first ten months of the finanoial year emounted to 3,733 lakhe, an increass of 1,034 lakhs over the figure for the corresponding period of the previous year.     In the ootton trade there had been a decrease both in quantity and value of exports.     Raw cotton exported was less by 42,000 tons or 10 per cent., and by 661 lakhs or 15 per cent., than for the corresponding period of the previous year, the whole of this reduction being acoounted for by the trade to Japan and that to China which was practically non-existent this financial year.     Exports of yarn were down by 15,000,000 lbs. and 104 lakhs, the whole of the decrease being due to stagnation in the China trade.   Thus, the net position in regard to cotton was that the values were down by 765 lakhs. Seeing that the increass in the total balance of trade (including bullion) was 1,034 lakhs more than in the previous year, it was obvious that the remaining trade has been generally very prosperous.There was no change in the crop forecasts whioh continued to be generally satisfactory.     The cotton press returns, however, hardly indicated that the superiority of this year&apos;s orop over last yearTs was as marked as had previously been thought.   They showed that in British India the number of bales pressed in the current season was slightly below those pressed in the same period last year.   This, however, probably did not mean that this year&apos;s orop had been over-estimated, but that last yearTs was under-estimated.   The index figure for wholesale prices in Calcutta, whioh had fallen from 148 to 145 in January, fell by a further point to 144 in February.    All these factors pointed to an increased purchasing power in the country.   The cotton industry however still remained far from prosperous, and stocks of raw cotton were increasing very greatly in Bombay, being now more than fifty per cent.above what they were last year.Of those imports into India for the montr of February for which figures were available, there were increases chiefly in iron and steal, beams and rails, locomotives, and pieoe goods of coloured cotton and artificial silk.    So far as the United Kingdom was concerned, imports of coloured piece goods increased by 5,000,000 yards and by 25 lakhs of rupees during January compared with a year ago, but under white pieoe goods there was a fall of 7 million yards and 30 lakhs of rupees, and under grey one million yards and four lakhs of rupees.    Imports of iron and steel from the United Kingdom were well up,particularly in steel beams and bars, tubes and pipes.     The chief increases
0 0 P*ZjCOtfPID/JiTIAL.IHDIA2T TRABS (C027JS. )in Indian exports were in ground nuts, cotton-seed,and hides and skins, raw and tanned.   The total United Kingdom imports into India for the ten months for which figures were available amounted this year to 99 - crores, as against 92^ crores last year, but the percentage remained very much the same.SOUTH Ai.-1.jRI CAS TJRAXjS.k&apos;R.HOSL said that as regards the trade of Argentina a general comparison of the figures for January, 1928, with those for the corresponding month of 1927 showed that, while the expansion in the value of imports was 27.2 per cent., the volume increased by 29.9 per cent., the small difference between the two percentages being due to the reduction in the general level of prioes, while the increase shown in the total value of exports was due to both higher prices and the greater volume of shipments.     From this it would appear thet Argentina1s foreign commerce was now dafinitely established upon an eoonomic price basis.     The present maize crop was likely to be a bumper one amounting to 7 or 8 million tons. Prospects in the Argentine were good in every respect apart from the influence of the Presidential election.     There was every prospeot of Dr. Hipolito Irigoyen being returned to office and the record of his party did not inspire confidence in commercial and financial circles.   Gold continued to flow into the country and if, under the rigid currency law, corresponding issues of paper dollars were made, there would be inflation.     A remedy would probably be found for that, however, and there would oertainly be no abrogation of the law which compelled a large proportion of gold to be held against the note circulation.In Chili there was a certain improvement,  though there again politics were not inspiring confidence.   The trade of the country was, however,  doing well.    Nitrate had been sold to an extent which six months ago would hardly have been considered possible, three million tons having been disposed of since the introduction of free selling in April 1927.    On the other hand all trade was being hampered by tariffs.    Cotton piece goods were going to pay, on importation, from 20 to 33 per cent, more than they did formerly, and certain lines of woollens were going to pas&apos; from 80 to 100 per cent. more.      These increases would probably affect British trade considerably.Brazil was looking up somewhat, although it was the least prosperous of the South American group at present.    Its loan issues continued to receive a favourable response in the London market.   There were two loans totalling three millions in March. Contrary to the case of the Argentine, whioh did most of its borrowing in New York, Brazil was getting its money here.   There might come a time when either of these countries might find it not too easy to fulfil the services of these loans&apos; as they fell due.   At a rough computation the loans that the United States of America had made to South Amerioa, and he spoke cnly of theA.3.C.1 countries, must amount roughly to three hundred million pounds.   That perhaps was not a too cautious amount to lend to countries which were only partially developed.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (COKgD.)Peru had e fair outlook at present.    Sugar and ootton prices ware helping the&amp;i.    Special temporary measures had already been taken to support the exchange rate and it was hoped that, with the assistance of the special oo-^iissicn on the currency, headed by a united btates expert, the beneficial results of a stabilised exchange, achieved by similar co.ith,ssions     in other South American republics would be extended to Peru.In regard to the Central American countries kir. Hose had little to report.     The commercial situation in Salvador continued fairly satisfactory;  stocks in the hands of merchants were diminishing, coffee prices had improved, and there was a considerable demand for credit for the financing of the crop. Exports of coffee from Guatemala had recently been heavy, but it was as yet too early to gauge prospects for the 1926-2S crop as the dry season had not yet terminated.    In Nicaragua, where the Presidential elections were due to take place shortly the political situation was still unsettled, but trade conditions were considered encouraging, inereasad activity having resulted from the gathering of the coffee crop - which was one of the largest on record - and the expenditure 01 the United States military forces in the Republic.   The cocoa harvest in Ecuador had been very late this season, but the yield was stated to be satisfactory.     The coffee market had been active, with a good demand in evidence.   The past year had witnessed a serious endeavour on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities to consolidate the national finances and to ensure stable economic conditions.    Transport conditions on the River iiagdalena in Colombia were still difficult, owing to the lack of rain.    Reports from some districts in the Republic stated that the coffee crop would be poor, but, generally speaking, the outlook for the harvest was considered favourable It had been a matter ox considerable gratification to those having interests in Colombia to observe the ready response accorded to the^recent issue in London of an amount ox  1,000,000 in 7^ Sterling Bonds of the Mortgage Bank of Bogota, which were ofxered at the price ox 92v per cent.., and -were immediately over-subscribed.    South American countries v/ere this year tending to borrow money more heavily in the London and New York markets than in 19 27, and in practically every case the public offering had been over-subscribed-

.Statement regarding the export trade position made at the meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Overseas Trade hold on V/wednesday, 14th March, 1928.MR. HICHENS (Shipbuilding) stated that on the whole there had been some improvement in the steel trade.     As regards railway carriages and wagons there were fey/-enquiries, but of the business that was going this country was securing a fair share.      In shipbuilding, enquiries werG not so numerous, though there was a fair volume of work in the yards.     Prices were cut to the bone.     It was easier to compete v/ith Germany owing to German stabilisation and increases in wages, though we still had to cut prices keenly.     As regards Belgium, we were not able to compete in castings.MR. BRUCE-GARDNER (Iron and Steel) reported that the position was if anything a little better and stated that enquiries were being received for shipment abroad.     There was a decided increase in che price of semi-finished steel, such as billets, sheet bars, etc. coming into the country so that the disparity between British and continental prices had diminished.      Belgian, French and German makers were very full up with orders, and the price of sheet bars had advanced by 8/-to 9/- per ton.     For the first time since the war some English makers were actually quoting the same price as that named by continental manufacturers.In 1927 the galvanised sheet and black sheet trade had a record year, the exports totalling 1,200,000 tons.     At the last meeting he had called attention to the temporary set back in India in galvanised sheets and had expressed the view that a new buying movement would take place in February.     His view had been confirmed and satisfactory orders had been received from the market in question.     Mr. Bruce Gardner also mentioned that his firm had their own factory for galvanising in the Argentine which was necessitated by the very heavy duty which had teen imposed on galvanised sheets a3 compared with that leviable on the black sheets.     They were consequently in a most favourable position in regard to Argentine trade.     He pointed out that where the imports of galvanised sheets showed a falling off there would often be a corresponding increase in the trade in black sheets and this might be attributed to the erection of galvanising works.MR. ROSTAND (Agriculture and General Engineering) stated that there had been a slight improvement in the export demand and that in general engineering conditions were better.He referred to criticisms which had been made in the Daily Press regarding British manufacturers and in particular to an article which appeared in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; of the .8th February, in which disparaging remarks were made regarding motor-car and agricultural machinery manufacturers, especially with reference to their inability or unwillingness to offer goods suitable for the Argentine market.     He stated that he had felt impelled to send a rejoinder to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; which they had published on the 14th February, in which he pointed out   that his group had established an efficient organisation in the Argentine and that they were in a position to supply machinery and service

Mr. Bruce Gardner also mentioned that his firm had their own factory for galvanising in the Argentine which was necessitated by the very heavy duty which had been imposed on galvanised sheets a3 compared with that leviable on the black sheets.     They v/ere consequently in a most favourable position in regard to Argentine trade.      He pointed out that where the imports of galvanised sheets showed a falling off there would often be a corresponding increase in the trade in black sheets and this might be attributed to the erection of galvanising works.MR. ROWLAND (Agriculture and General Engineering) stated that there had been a slight improvement in the export demand and that in general engineering conditions were better.He referred to criticisms which had been made in the Daily Press regarding British manufacturers and in particular to an article which appeared in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; of the ,8th February, in which disparaging remarks were made regarding motor-car and agricultural machinery manufacturers, especially with reference to their inability br unwillingness to offer goods suitable for the Argentine market.     He stated that he had felt impelled to send a rejoinder to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; which they had published on the 14th February,  in which he pointed out   that his group had established an efficient organisation in the Argentine and that they were in a position to supply machinery and service
which would compare very favourably with those of any other competitor.     He felt that some of these criticisms were inspired by our.American and German competitors, but the trouble was* that the Press of this country were only too ready to publish such statements.MR. GRAY BUCHANAN (Iron and Steel, General Merchant Trade) stated that the continental prices of pig iron were now approx-Imately the same as those quoted for Middlesbrough Iron.      In many markets there was evidence of a reversion to pre-war conditions and the normal stream of orders in ordinary stock lines was coming forward.     He felt we were on the eve of better things.MR. JOHNSTON  (Pottery) said that things were getting worse and that they had been compelled In export markets to make a concession of 25 per cent, in prices.     The trade was actually operating at a loss.      In his view the position was entirely due to the question of wages.     A commission representative of the sanitary trade had recently visited Belgium for the purpose of ascertaining conditions prevailing in the Belgian industry and found the rates of wages paid in Belgium were 100 per cent, less than would have to be paid in this country.     On the other hand, he understood that taxation was as high as, If not higher than in this country, and the Belgian taxation scheme was complicated. Nevertheless, owing to low wage rates, all the advantage was on the side of manufacturers in Belgium.      Competition was also acute from Germany,  Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Holland and France. In present conditions there was every inducement to transfer the industry to Belgium, where ?fages were lower, steamship freights were less, and dock charges   more reasonable.MR. PARKER (Boots and Shoes) said that there had been an agreeable increase in British exports, but on the other hand the imports into this country of footwear for the masses had increased. He thought that we could continue to secure an export trade in high grade footwear and sports goods in competition with European and American manufacturers, but we could not compete in low grade lines for reasons similar to those advanced by Mr. Johnston.   A point worthy of interest was that, while the advance in the price of material had been world-wide, the difference in the prices of home producers and foreign was not so great as it was six months ago.MR. HOLROYD (Cotton Spinning) stated that in the American Section   the consumption of cotton in the last six months had been greater than for some time past.     Stocks of yarn were decreasing. The Egyptian Section was operating on a profitable basis for the finer counts but in the ordinary counts of 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s prices were not so remunerative.     There were more spindles and looms in existence than could be employed.MR. VYLE (Hardware, Metals, etc.) referring to general trade stated that he was optimistic,      The basic industries were not perhaps what they ought to be, but specialised trades were pros-prosperous.     As regards Overseas Dominions he personally had nothing to complain about the results of 1927.      In Australia the situation was good, while in South Africa business was better and profits higher.   ,With reference to the remarks of Mr. Johnston, he stated that he, too, had had to erect factories in Belgium, Italy and other foreign countries.     As regards the man hours engaged there was no
doubt that the British workman was far superior hut if we multi-plied the man hour by the rate per hour and added taxation and social services we found it impossible to compete.MR. DOD^ELL (China Merchant Trade) reported that generally speaking the situation in China showed great improvement. Probably more business had been done in the last two months than in the whole of last year.     The piece goods and metal trades were brisk.     He thought it was significant that the nationalist government had found it advisable to reinstate the European officials in the administration of the salt gabelle.MR. GORDON (acting Indian Trade Commissioner) stated that conditions in India were very satisfactory.     The railway budget and the general budget had been presented and showed a remarkably satisfactory position.      In regard to the railway budget, owing to the strong financial position, it had been possible to announce reductions in the lower classes of passenger rates and in the carriage on certain goods.     The cost of living figures had fallen from 148 to 145, which might result in higher purchasing power. Favourable forecasts had been received of the crops.     The final cotton crop was about half a million bales better than the previous yeir.     Wheat and rice were approximately equal and the smaller crops were in excees.      Trade should therefore be good.     As regards imports into India,  in the month of January and in the calendar year, increases were shown in the proportion from Great Britain of iron and steel.     As regards exports, there had been    * a revival in the exports of hides and skins, particularly last month.
