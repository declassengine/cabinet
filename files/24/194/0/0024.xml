his document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)EGRET. ^ :r.    r/.P.   124. OABIKHT.CHANNEL ISLANDS AND TAX MVASIQN.:.. -roranduin by the Home Secretary on the Inland Revenue Memorandum ( 3 (28)) circulated by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.The Home Office are concerned in this matter merely as custodians of the interests of the Crown in relation to the Channel Islands, and from that standpoint they view with serious alarm the loss of prestige which will undoubtedly ensue if the agreement is allowed to become a dead letter.      In order that the agreement might be concluded and what was considered the scandal of the use of the Channel Islands for the purpose of tax evasion terminated, His Majesty&apos;s Government have gone out of their way to treat the Channel Islands with a deference to which they are not entitled and which has never been previously conceded.      This has been done with great publicity both in the Islands and in this country, and although-h there is opposition in the [slands to the agreement,  the fact that their representatives were allowed to negotiate with : representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government on an equal footing, and that the negotiations were opened by the announcement that His Majesty&apos;s Government would accept war contributions which the Channel Islands had every reason to know .?ere regarded by His Majestyfs Government aa entirely inadequate, has been acclaimed as a triumph.If the agreement is now fcr any reason allowed to become a dead letter,   the position of the Home Office in dealing with the-many -complicated Issues which are raised by the Channel Islands will be very much more difficult in future. Should the real reason become known, viz., that this was due, not to any change of circumstances after the signing of the agreement, but to an inherent defect in the agreement itself,   .
the damage to the reputation of Mis Majesty&apos;s Government will be far greater, and will be felt not in the Channel Islands alone.I do not in the least desire to traverse the views of the Dominions Office on the constitutional questions which might be raised on the clauses even in their amended form, except that I might say that I doubt -whether they really . imply the conception of a olass of United Kingdom Nationals. But I suggest that in the event of any such question   being raised by any Dominions, the explanation which the statesmen of the Dominions as practical men might be asked to accept is that there is nothing in ths legislation which can affect prejudicially either the present or the future status of the Dominions,  which in this respect are treated in the same manner as fully independent foreign states.      There never was any intention that the legislation ahould affect the Dominions and it oannot in fact affect any one of them unless it concludes an agreement.      No Dominion is going to be asked to conclude an agreement, and there is not, and never has been, any intention to propose an agreement to any country except the Channel Islands and possibly the Isle of Man.The ohoiee before us is between the certainty of   cis discredit if we let the agreement drop and the possible risk of having to enter into explanations with the Dominions, if re pursue the matter, and so far as I am concerned I would strongly urge the desirability of aocepting this possible risk./e might conceivably get the Channel Islands to agree to the exclusion of the self-governing Dominions either individually by name or by some comprehensive description, but I am convinced that we should only be asking for a rebuff if we were to put to them a proposal that the legislation should be specifically directed against them.      Their representatives at the Conference asked that the legislation should not be lirected to  the Channel Islands but should be in general terms
1 onloth April,  1928.3o as to bo capable of application to any territory in which the conditions giving rise to the present problem were found and which accepted the necessary arrangements for cooperation, and this request was conceded at the very outset of the discussion.IV.J.H.
