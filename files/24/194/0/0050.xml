SECRET. Copy No.    28CP. 150 (28).cabinet.SILVER IN THE IRISH FREE STATE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State fob Dominion Affairs.1 AM sorry that circumstances should have arisen which make it necessary to consider the introduction of legislation of the kind proposed bv tho Treasury in CP. 137 (28).A somewhat similar situation arising out of the transition from &quot; British &quot; to &quot;local silver&quot; coinage has occurred in other Dominions, and I am informed that on previous occasions, while the Treasury have refused to admit any liability to accept immediately at face value all the British coins circulating in the Dominion and replaced, they have found it possible to make some concession to the Dominion concerned. For example, in the case of the Commonwealth of Australia, an arrangement was made, which took effect in 1910, that, in addition to the normal replacement of &quot;worn&quot; coins, the Branch Mints in Australia should be authorised to accept British token coins (silver and bronze) to the face value of  100,000 a year.The same point arose in the Union of South Africa in 1922, and the Treasury agreed to permit the Pretoria Branch Mint to accept, in addition to worn coins, silver coins v925 fine) up to the value of  100,000 a year. The Union authorities pressed for a further concession, and the Treasury eventually agreed, having regard in particular to difficulties pointed out in connection with tho sorting, &amp;c, of worn coin, to increase the annual value to be withdrawn to  200,000 for four years, basing this on an agreed estimate (4*350,000) of the &quot; worn &quot; coin actually circulating in the Union.It is true that the Treasury have never admitted that any obligation rests on them to accept silver coinage (wherever circulating) at its face value, and the arrangements indicated above have always been set out as concessions.In recent correspondence with the Free State as to the making of arrangements with the Royal Mint for the coinage of the new Free State coins, the Treasury asked that it should be made clear to the Free State that they admitted no liability to receive back British token coins at their face value, and a statement to this effect was included in a despatch to the Free State on the 24th April, 1927. The Free State replied, in a despatch of the 20th May, that they could not accept this contention. The question was raised of suggesting to the Free State that they would not, in fact, lose if they took over the existing stock and had it reminted into new coinage, but the Treasury thought it wiser not to make any offer or suggestion to tho Freo State.While, on general grounds, I should have wished to press that a similar concession should bo accorded to tho Irish Froo State to that accorded to tho Commonwealth of Australia and tho Union of South Africa, I appreciate that tho case of tho Irish Free State is differentiated by the faot that there has been a complete financial settlement botwoon tho London and Dublin Exchequors, to whioh effect was given in 1925. I feel compelled, however, to express my anxiety as to the effect of legislation in tho form proposed on our future good [17G29]his Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.;Printed for the Cabinet.
relations with the Free State, and 1 should much prefer if some alternative arrangement could be made, such as that indicated in paragraph 5 of the Treasury Memorandum, which did not involve legislation.; In any case, there is one point in connection with the contemplated legislation on which I feel that I must ask for some alteration. It is apparently proposed to retain the obsolete use of the word &quot; foreign &quot; as applying to all countries outside the United Kingdom. On general grounds 1 would strongly urge that it would be desirable to take this opportunity to get rid of that designation from the provisions of the Customs Acts, just as the opportunity was taken in 1922 in the Importation of Animals Act (j 8) to get rid of the designation &quot; foreign &quot; as applied to imported animals and to replace it by the designation &quot;imported.&quot; This point is of special importance in relation to the Irish Free State, since we are particularly anxious to afford no excuse to the Free State for treating tho United Kingdom as a foreign country in the ordinary accented sense of the term.L. S. A.Downing Street, May 4, 1928.
