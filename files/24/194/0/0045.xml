INTRODU factory.AT their meeting held on the 13th March, 1928 (Cabinet 14 (28), Conclusion 5), the Cabinet approved in principle that the question of the investment of foreign capital in British enterprise, and the extent to which it would result in foreign control of vital national interests, should be referred to the Committee of Civil Research, and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the President of the Board of Trade, should be asked to advise the Prime Minister as to the Terms of Reference and the composition of the Inquiry.2. In accordance with this decision, the Prime Minister invited the Committee of Civil Research &quot; To examine the facts with regard to the influx of American capital and control into electrical companies in this country, and to advise whether any undesirable consequences are to be expected especially in the form of orders for equipment being given abroad and whether any preventive measures can or should be adopted.&quot;&quot;3.

II. Extent to which American Capital has been introduced into the electrical Industry.4. We addressed ourselves in the first instance to an examination of the facts with regard to the influx of American capital and control into electrical companies in this country. In doing so, we thought it convenient to distinguish between the acquisition for investment purposes by individual American purchasers of shares in British electrical undertakings, and the purchase by American financial interests of such shares for the purpose of obtaining control of the operations of the Companies concerned. As regards the former, it does not appear that British electrical shares have been bought in America to any considerable extent, and, in any case, we do not consider that objection could be taken to foreign investments of this hind in British industry. The purchase, however, of shares for the purpose of obtaining control stands on a different footing. It appears that these purchases are being made through the medium of a Trust known as the Greater London and Counties Trust, Ltd. Its normal capital amounts to  2,000.000, of which only  700.000 has been issued. This Trust has already acquired the control of the East Anglian Electricity Supply Company, the Wcssex Electricity Company, the Bedfordshire. Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire Electricity Company, and Edmundson&apos;s Electricity Corporation, Limited. EdmundsonV is tho direct owner of certain statutory &quot;undertakings, and, through holding interests, controls many others. The Trust has also, we understand, acquired one or two small undertakings and is in process of acquiring others, mainly in the area covered by the South-East England Electricity Scheme, but has it in contemplation to extend its activities into other areas. For example, a proposal is afoot for the construction of a super-power station on Southampton Water. The Trust has further, according to information supplied to us. purchased a considerable, but not a controlling, interest in the North Metropolitan Electric Power Supply Company, and a working arrangement has been made with that Company for ten years, under which it will manage the Bedfordshire. Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire Company, which holds Parliamentary powers in respect of a large and important area. In addition to these activities, it is reported that the General Electric Company of New York has taken over the Vickers holding in the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company.5. Owing to the many ways in which financial control can be obtained, it is often difficult to ascertain whether a given Company is financially independent. So far as we have been able to ascertain, tho position in the electrical industry is that of a total of 233 supplving companies, 147 are apparently financially independent. They represent a capitalisation of only  16.000.000 out of  78,000.000 invested in the industry. The chief interests in the remaining companies are held by a number of financial groups. While control can generally be obtained by the offer of tempting prices for the shares, we can find no evidence at the moment of any comprehensive scheme for attempted American domination in the major controlling groups. Without such control, American interests will not be able to extend to any large extent their investments in the British electrical industry.III. Possible Consequences of Introduction of American Capital intothe Electrical Industry.6. The second part of our terms of reference deals with the question whether any undesirable consequences are to be expected from the introduction of American capital into the electrical industry. We have already dealt with the question of the acquisition by foreigners of shares in the British electrical industry tor investment purposes. As regards purchases the object of which is to secure control, it appears to us that if foreign financial interests were determined to acquire such control, it would not be possible for the Government to prevent their doing so. Apart from the practical difficulties which would be involved, we do not think it would be desirable for the Government to attempt to impose restrictions. In any ease, the electrical companies of which control could conceivably be acquired only represent one-third of the British industry, two-thirds of which is in the hands of the municipalities. This situation differs from that in the United States, and appears to us to offer a permanent barrier to any question of comprehensive American domination of the British electrical industry. Further, from some points of view, the influx of American capital and the consequent introduction of American methods may well bo
positively beneficial. We have, however, considered what steps, if any, are necessary to prevent the possible abuse by foreign-controlled companies of the statutory monopoly which they enjoy. In this connection, we have reviewed the steps taken by Parliament in recent years, and we consider that, both in the Metropolitan area and in the county districts, they are adequate to secure to the consumer a fair price and an adequate supply. Moreover, in a few years&apos; time, when the Electricity Supply Act (1926) is in full working order, the position will be further safeguarded by the introduction of a sliding scale over the whole country. Apart from this aspect of the question, the principle on which the American electrical industry has been developed, viz., high efficiency, large turnover and low rate of profit, would, if applied by the American controlling companies, be advantageous to the British consumer. We do not think, therefore, that the present difficulties in regard to electrical prices are likely to be increased by the introduction of American capital into the industry.7. As regards orders for equipment, we do not think that there is any probability that such orders would be diverted from this country by Companies under American control. American prices for electrical equipment are generally higher than British prices, and American practice would not readily be accepted, nor would it be generally suitable for British conditions. As to questions of personnel, we do not consider that it is likely that such Companies would seek to introduce American engineers into executive positions in this country. Attempts of this kind have been made in the past in other industries by Companies under American control, but never with success.S. We have also considered the question of the possible employment of foreign engineers in this country from the point of view of national security in time of war or civil emergency. If, for example, railway electrification took &quot;place on a large scale, and if Americans were employed in high positions on the railways, difficulties might arise in times of crises. In certain cases the railway managers have been confidentially consulted on particular points. It would be embarrassing if the railway managers were foreigners, and. in the same way, if the railways and other services were electrified, it might be embarrassing to have to discuss and arrange confidential matters with key men who were -Americans. Again, we consider it unlikely that executive appointments would be filled by Americans.9. In general, we consider that the possible effects of American capital control of British Electrical Companies, apart from mere sentiment, are unlikely to be really dangerous or undesirable, either in a national sense or in the British consumers&apos; interests, but we feel that the position is one which should be kept under constant review, and we recommend that this duty should be undertaken by the Minister of Transport. This review should include both the general question of the extent and effects of American control and the particular question of the employment of American engineers, especially in key-positions, which might have an important bearing in the case of a national emergency.IV. Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.iU.   We summarise our principal conclusions as follows : (i.) The influx of American capital into the British electrical industry, either (a) for investment purposes or (b) for the purpose of acquiring control, does not appear at present to be large, (ii.) No objection can be taken on public grounds to purchases of British sharesby Americans for investment purposes, (iii.) As regards the introduction of American capital for the purpose of obtaining control, no objection need be taken to American purchases on their present scale. It is unlikely that American control will result in orders for equipment being given in the United States by American-controlled companies, or that American engineers will be introduced by American-controlled companies. Further, the present difficulties in regard to electrical prices are not likely to be increased by the introduction of American control, as the trend of American policy is to aim at a small profit on a large turnover.
o11.   In view, however, of possible developments, wo recommend That arrangements should be made by the Minister of Transport to keep under periodical review (a.) The general question of the investment of American capital in British Electrical Companies for the purpose of obtaining control.(b.) The particular question of the extent of the employment of American engineers, particularly in key positions, which might have an important bearing in the case of a national emergency.Signed on behalf of the Committee, PEEL, Chairman.&apos;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, April 30, 1928.
