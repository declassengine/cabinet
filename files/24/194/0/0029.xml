March 1928.SECRET.Copy No. 30COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the IZUk Meeting, held on March 29, 1928.(1.)-ANTI-AIRCRAFT RESEARCH.(C.I.D. Paper No. 866-B.)(Previous Reference: C.I.D. Minutes of the 208th Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Anti-Aircraft Research Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 866-B). for the consideration of which Lord Haldane attended the meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER welcomed Lord Haldane, thanked him on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence for the very valuable Report he had submitted and invited him to make any further comments he wished upon the Report.LORD HALDANE stated that it was two years since his Committee had submitted a Report to the Committee of Imperial Defence. At that time his Committee, having surveyed the whole field, had defined the scientific problems which required probing, and had asked for permission to continue their investigations. Since then the whole ground had been covered once again. His Committee had been fortunate in having the active assistance of three eminent scientists, namely, Professor Lindemann, Professor Taylor and Mr. J. B. S. Haldane. Finally, having adjusted a number of points, his Committee arranged that a Sub-Committee, presided over by Mr. F. E. Smith (Director of Scientific Research at the Admiralty), and consisting of Mr. H. E. Wimperis (Director of Scientific Research at the Air Ministry), and Colonel G. R. Pridham (President of the Royal Engineer Board), should be established to draft a comprehensive Report on the present situation. It was this Report which was now before the Committee of Imperial Defence. It would be noted that considerable progress had been made in the course of the last two years. In the first place, many lines of research had been eliminated as being unlikely to produce useful results, while others, which held out prospects of success, were indicated. The Committee had applied itself to the problem of ascertaining in the first place how best to detect the approach of hostile aircraft, which, according to the estimate of the Air Staff, might be expected to cross the coast at a speed of 150 miles an hour, and at a height of some 20,000 feet. These investigations had gone to prove that detection by means of induced electro magnetic effects, disturbances due to the magneto and heat radiation, was not likely to be successful, and that the most hopeful line of development lay in. a further study of acoustical methods. Means of detecting aircraft by acoustical methods had already been developed, and were in actual operation for short distances, i.e., under 25 miles. What was required, however, was to secure warning of the approach of hostile aircraft beyond this range. For this purpose, the method which held out the best prospect of success was the use of a largo &quot;mirror.&quot; This &quot;mirror&quot; consisted of a concrete wall of 150-ibot radius of curvature, vertically and horizontally adapted for listeners by the use of a listening trench concentric with the &quot; mirror &quot;and 75 feet from it. In this &quot;trench&quot; the requisite microphones were installed. The construction of such a &quot;mirror &quot; involved a considerable amount of work, which had of necessity to be very carefully carried out, and the estimated cost amounted to approximately  5,000. There were other means of detection by acoustical methods, employing discs, trumpets, &amp;c. the development of which was, however, within the competence of [17456-1]
the Departments already engaged on this research work. What was now required was sanction for the expenditure of the requisite funds to construct a large &quot; mirror,&quot; such as he had described, for experimental purposes. In addition to detection, research was being conducted in the various directions indicated in the Report. As was well known, research was not work which could be hurried and therefore it might well be some time before any further considerable advance could be registered. In regard to these points the Report spoke for itself, and he did not think any useful purpose would be served by his elaborating them in detail. He would, however, only be too pleased to answer any questions which members of the Committee might wish to put to him. He emphasised that the Report was an extremely secret document, and that, therefore, it was very desirable that every care should be taken to ensure that it should not fall into unauthorised hands.GENERAL CHARLES stated that the War Office was unable to find the money for the experimental &quot;mirror&quot; out of existing resources. Such a device was primarily required in the event of war against France, which was not a contingency which was envisaged at the present time.SIR SAMUEL HOARE considered that the Report was a very valuable one indeed, and was satisfactory in that it showed that in many respects we were ahead of other nations in regard to research work for anti-aircraft purposes. It was extremely necessary that we should be in such a position owing to the very vulnerable target which London presented to attack from the air. Particularly he thought that we were ahead of other nations in regard to the development of pilotless aircraft, and for this reason he was rather anxious that the use of this type of aircraft should be restricted, and especially that they should not, at any rate for the present, be employed as targets for anti-aircraft gunnery practice.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD emphasised that not only were these pilotless aircraft secret, but that the Air Ministry hoped to develop them for offensive purposes. Each of these aircraft cost in the neighbourhood of  2,000. He thought, therefore, that, for the time being, they should not be utilised as targets for anti-aircraft gunnery purposes. He did not wish to imply that pilotless aircraft should never be used for this purpose, but rather that they should not be so used until such time as the existing &quot;sleeve &quot; and &quot;glider &quot; targets were no longer of any use owing to developments in anti-aircraft gunnery performance. He pointed out that the figures given in Paragraph 44 of the Report indicated bursts on the line of sight only, which were not necessarily all hits.LORD HALDANE stated that &quot;predictors&quot; were being developed which had already produced, and would probably continue to produce, a great improvement in anti-aircraft gunnery practice.Mr. BRIDGEMAN agreed that the cost of these pilotless aircraft was an objection to their use as targets. He suggested, however, that anti-aircraft gunnery practice could be carried out under conditions which would reduce to the minimum the chance of information in regard to these aircraft getting into the wrong hands. He thought that it was very important indeed that suitable targets should be available for anti-aircraft gunnery purposes, and enquired whether it would not be possible to produce some cheaper form of pilotless aircraft for this purpose.SIR CHARLES A1ADDEN pointed out that the Admiralty were developing a multiple pom-pom for use against torpedo planes when they had dived in order to fire torpedoes and were at close range. These conditions were unsuitable for the sleeve or glider targets, and a controlled plane appeared to offer the only realistic target obtainable. He enquired whether it would not be possible to employ pilotless aircraft for this purpose which had already been used and were becoming worn out.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD explained that these aircraft, once flown, were no longer of any use.Mr. CHURCHILL stated that, in his opinion, the Committee was very much indebted to Lord Haldane for the very valuable Report which he had presented. It was obviously impossible for the Treasury to stand in the way of the development of so useful a device as the &quot;mirror&quot; might prove to be. The means of providing the requisite funds for this purpose would be considered by the Treasury when the case was put up by tho Department concerned. With regard to the development of multiple pom-poms, he pointed out that the Admiralty were contemplating an
extensive programme. He had, of course, no objection to experiments being carried out, but when the supply stage was reached the number of guns required would involve considerable expense. He did not think that this supply should be undertaken until the Committee of Imperial Defence had considered the matter. He was of the opinion that pilotless aircraft should not be used for anti-aircraft gunnery purposes at the present time.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the Report should be approved, and that the question of the provision of the requisite sums for the development of the &quot; mirror    should be considered by the Cabinet.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a.) To approve the Report of the Anti-Aircraft Research Sub-Committee(C.I.D. Paper No. 866--B). (&amp;.) To recommend to the Cabinet that the necessary funds ( 5,000) for theconstruction of an experimental &quot;mirror&quot; for acoustical detectionshould be provided.(c.) That pilotless aircraft should not for the present be used as targets for anti-aircraft gunnery purposes. (d.) To thank Lord Haldane and his Committee for the very valuable report which they had submitted.******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, March 29, 1928.

ANTI-AIRCRAFT RESEARCH COMMITTEE.Report to the Committee of Imperial Defence.(Note. The figures in brackets refer to the numbered paragraphs of the Reportby the Scientific Advisers attached.)1. IN December last we appointed a Sub-Committee composed of the scientific advisers to the Fighting Services and requested them to report to us on the present position in regard to research for anti-aircraft purposes generally, indicating particularly those directions in which the results already obtained appeared to Justify work being continued, or, on the other hand, held out insufficient prospects to justify work being continued. We also asked that the report should indicate any lines of research not at present being followed which might be taken up with advantage. We have now received the report of our Sub-Committee, which we have carefully considered in the light of our previous deliberations on the subject and of the detailed information communicated to us from time to time at our request by the Fighting Services. We desire to submit this report, with our observations thereon, to the Committee of Imperial Defence.2. We are generally in complete agreement with the conclusions expressed in the report, and we desire to support the recommendations embodied in Part II. We are of the opinion that as general an approval as possible should be given to the main lines of investigation suggested, and that any specific recommendations should not be taken as limiting research rigidly to particular directions. Such limitations, we consider, would hamper the research workers of the Fighting Services.3. We unanimously accept the conclusion of the report (73) that at present acoustical methods provide the only means which hold out any prospect of detecting at night or at a distance the presence of hostile aircraft, but in view of the meteorological effects (7) which impose limitations on acoustical methods, we consider it desirable that the possibility of the development of other methods should always be kept in mind.4. As a means of long-distance detection we desire most strongly to recommend to the Committee of Imperial Defence that the necessary financial provision, approximately  5,000, should be made to enable the War Office to carry out experiments with a 200-ft. mirror (76).5. We agree that detection from ships cannot at present be considered as reliable, but that further experiments on the analysis of sound might make detection at sea possible, and we accordingly recommend that the investigations on the analysis of aeroplane sounds should be continued (13, 14, 74).6. We have noted the limitations of the disc system of listening referred to in the report (78). We recommend, however, that experiments with small mirrors and with discs should be continued. We make this recommendation not with the object of recommending complete sets of defences, but to indicate experiments upon which such systems of defence might later be based.7. We accept the recommendations of the report with regard to the development of listening trumpets and of the binaural sound locator (79).8. We desire especially to call attention to the experiments which are being conducted by the Services with a view to the selection of acoustical observers (24, 25). We consider that the success of sound-detecting methods and also of the satisfactory picking up of aircraft by searchlights depends very largely upon the selection of suitable personnel for manipulating the instruments. At our request, therefore, the Medical Research Council has been asked to carry out investigations on the physiology of hearing and of vision with a view to arriving at tests which could be applied to the selection of personnel employed on such work.9. As regards other methods of detection, we agree that no useful results have been obtained from attempts to detect aircraft by induced magnetic effects or by
disturbances due to the magneto (27 to 31). We also consider that ordinary heat radiation from an aeroplane (32) cannot be satisfactorily used for detection purposes, but we are of the opinion that there may be other methods of detecting aircraft by reflected electro-magnetic waves which are worthy of attention and these, we under-stand, are being considered by the Fighting Services.10. We recommend that the investigations on searchlights described in the report should he continued (33, 82).11. We have been told that, despite the claims of the French that the flood-light system of producing a silhouette effect on aircraft had been successful, tests in England have so far shown that the method is valueless for this purpose (36 to 30. S3). Before, however, the method is finally abandoned we consider that the experi-ments referred to in the report (39 (c)) should be repeated, in which attempts were made to obtain a silhouette effect by a powerful light vertically above the illuminated area such as could be provided by parachute flares liberated from an aeroplane at J 000 to 5,000 ft. Tf these are successful the flood-light system in a modified form might be feasible.12. In our opinion the methods for communicating between gound and air arc developing satisfactorily (40).13. We accept the general conclusions and recommendations (84 to 87) of the portion of the report dealing with offensive action. We agree that the develpment of anti-aircraft gunnery is a matter of the utmost importance, and that research is vital.14. We would draw attention to the figures showing the improvement of hursts on the line of sight contained in the report (44). This improvement has been produced by the development of aircraft predictors, and we recommend that research upon them should be continued. The Admiralty and War Office consider that the development of pilotless aircraft as targets for anti-aircraft gunnery practice is essential. It has been represented to us by the Air Ministry, however, that there may be certain objections to their development for this purpose and we accordingly make no recommendations thereon.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee, HALDANE, Chairman.

DETECTION.6. The most practicable means at present available for detecting hostile aircraft appears to lie in the development of apparatus for the detection of aircraft by sound-gathering devices. A requirement is that aeroplanes should be detected at a range of 25 miles and their approximate direction measured.Acoustical Detection.Meteorological A coustics.7. Apart from the immobility of the necessary apparatus, the disadvantage of long-distance sound-detecting devices lies in the fact that certain phenomena, namely, the refraction, absorption and scattering of sound in the atmosphere, may render them useless for long-range listening on certain days during the year. In order that accurate data may be available on which it is possible to estimate with some exactness for what period acoustical detecting instruments can be effectively used, the War Oflice are carrying out at the Air Defence Establishment certain fundamental investigations on the propagation of sound through the atmosphere and its correla-tion with meteorological conditions. In order to find out the relation between weather conditions and audibility, experiments were made in 1921 by listening by mirror and electrical apparatus to a North Goodwin siren at a range of 7 miles. The observa-tions were made at Joss Gap and extended over a month. During 1027 investigations were undertaken with the object of determining the relation between attenuation and meteorological conditions. These are being continued. The method used consists in recording the sound from the explosion of a gun-cotton charge by microphones spaced at half-mile intervals over a range of 8 miles. Simultaneously, very careful observa-tions of wind and temperature conditions (the latter by means of an aeroplane) are obtained.  The analysis of the results of the experiments has not yet been completed.8. &quot; In order to find the limits of audibility of aeroplanes in flight at night under various weather conditions, experiments in which listening was carried out by ear and the record of the track of the aeroplane by theodolite, have been carried out. The mean range was found to be 7-4 miles for aircraft at 10,000 feet for an end-on aspect of the aeroplane and about 9 to 10 miles for the broadside aspect. Observations on prevalent wind structure have also been carried out.9. In July 1927 interesting results on the transmission of sound through the upper atmosphere were obtained. The source of sound was a 16-inch gun at Shoeburyness. The range of audibility of the sound was measured by microphone and recording apparatus installed at various Universities Southampton, Bristol, Birmingham. Recorded ranges of 132 and 143 miles were repeatedly observed. The gun wTas, however, inaudible at 100 miles. The experiments are proceeding, and it is proposed to consider whether the results can be applied to aeroplane detection.A nalysis of A eroplane Sounds.10. The experiments described above indicated that the absorption and scattering of sound in the atmosphere varied with the frequency of the sounds observed. In order to take, advantage of this fact in the design of sound-detecting apparatus, investigations on the analysis of aeroplane sounds have been undertaken. A mathematical summary of known information on this point has been made, and a full investigation of the&quot; aeroplane sound spectrum, by means of resonator analysis for vibrations from 50 to 1,000 per second, is in progress. In May 1925 clear evidence of the existence of vibrations of the order of 10 per minute from aeroplanes was established by means of microphone and photographic recording. In October 1925 an investigation of aeroplane sound led to the discovery of vibrations of the order of 16 per second; subsequently, sounds of much lower frequency have been detected.Listening on Land.11.   Experiments were begun with mirror sound locators for long-distancelistening in  1917.    Paraboloid plaster mirrors  3 metres in  diameter were
employed, on an alti-azimuth mounting, with the usual scales and with a trumpet  collector  fitted  at  the  focus  provided  with  stethoscopes  for  the use of two listeners.   Trials were made by the British Army in the field and also at home.   The moving gear proved to be too heavy, and incapable of following a fast-moving target.   Movable mirrors were accordingly replaced by fixed mirrors of radii from 10 to 15 ft. and apertures of 15 to 20 ft.  The surfaces of the mirrors were spherical, and the sound was collected by trumpets on rotating arms travelling over focal surfaces.   A stethoscope attachment for one listener, working on the maximum sound, was provided.   With these mirrors the range and efficiency progressively improved with increase in size and with the improvement in the design of collecting trumpets.   With aircraft at 10,000 ft. the ranges obtained were of the order of 15 miles and the accuracy in bearing about 20.   With aircraft at 20,000 ft. it is believed that a greater range can be obtained.     The range thus obtained was about twice the unaided aural range. Experiments with the object of obtaining the position and course of aircraft at long ranges over sea are now- being undertaken, in which a system of three 20 ft. mirrors is being employed.  With the mirrors spaced at intervals of S miles between Dover and Dungeness, the intersection of the sound bearings corrected for sound lag will be determined.   In view of the experience with the smaller mirrors, it is proposed to undertake in 1928 experiments with a strip of a mirror of about 200 ft. aperture. The object of the investigation is to detect low frequency sounds of greater atmospheric penetration, and to associate with the apparatus automatic warning devices.  The mirror will be capable of use in a sector of S0o.  Proposals have been made for the construction of a section of the mirror surface consisting of a wall of 150 ft. radius of curvature, vertically and horizontally adapted for listeners by the use of a listening trench concentric with the mirror and 75 ft. from it.   Twenty microphones 6 ft. apart will be installed.     The proposed location is in  the Dungeness district.   The erection has not yet been begun, but plans and specifica-tions have been drawn up and an estimate of cost obtained.Listening in Captive Balloons.12. Normally one method of extending the acoustical horizon would be the installation of listening apparatus in captive balloons. Experiments with this object have been made, but the results proved so disappointing that it was considered that no useful advance was likely to be achieved in this direction. The results obtained either by the unaided ear or by sound-gathering apparatus installed in a captive balloon were definitely inferior to those obtained on the ground. No further experiments in captive balloons are therefore being carried out.[listening at Sea.13. Lengthy experiments with sound locators on board ship have been made, both as a means of giving warning to warships of the approach of enemy aircraft and as a possible means of extending the time of warning of the approach of enemy aircraft to the coast. Observations carried out by wireless telegraphy ratings oh board one of H.M. ships showed that the maximum wind for useful listening was 15 miles per hour, and that with ordinary trumpet sound locators an accuracy within 2 to 30 in day conditions for elevations of 10 to 70o could be obtained when observations were made upon a single aeroplane. The presence of other aeroplanes caused confusion when they were Hying in line. It was found that rifle firing could be partly ignored, and that sea noise was troublesome only when loud. A range of audibility of 6,600 to 10,300 yards in day-time conditions was obtained both with the unaided ear and with trumpet locators.&apos; It was found that the performance of the observers deteriorated after 10 minutes&apos; concentration. Further experiments were carried out to determine the best position of the sound locator in a ship. The best position was thought to be the after range-finding platform or some sheltered position aft. These early experiments showed that it was necessary that the constiuietion of the tripod used should be rigid, in order to withstand ship vibration, and that it was necessary to provide insulation from the decks. Experiments were made in ships sailing up and down the wind at 4. 8, 12 and 16 knots. Again in these experimentsit was found that tho maximum range attained was that of the unaided
ear, the aeroplane height being 5,000 ft. At ranges of 4,000 to 12,000 yards an accuracy of 2 to 30, as on land, was obtained under the best conditions, but the results were found to be very dependent on disturbing noises such as the sounds of machinery, wind in the rigging, &amp;c, which frequently swamped the aeroplane sounds completely.14. In order to get over the difficulties of extraneous noises, experiments were made on II.M. Drifter &quot; Lunar Bow &quot; and at the Hythe Acoustical Station with a paraboloid mirror of 4 ft. aperture. An increase in range at sea of about 20 per cent, under all weather conditions over that of the unaided ear was found, and comparable results were obtained on land. Experiments were also made with a 16-ft. exponential trumpet of the American type. The apparatus was similar to that used in the American sound locator. The increase in range over the unaided ear under all weather conditions was about 25 per cent. The apparatus was found, however, to be susceptible to wind, and the results did not justify its adoption. With a 16-ft. conical trumpet an increase in range of 29 per cent. over the unaided ear under all weather conditions was found, as compared with an increase of 31 per cent, on land. The apparatus was again susceptible to wind disturbances and was cumbersome to use. ft will be seen, therefore, that the results of listening at sea have not been satisfactory.Location of Enemy Aircraft after crossing the Coastline.   (Disc System.)15. Considerable research has been carried out with the object of obtaining accurate information as to the course, height, speed and number of enemy aeroplanes after they have crossed the coastline. The earliest experiments were carried out in 191S with listening wells formed of corrugated metal walls 10 ft. deep and 5 ft. in diameter, the sound of the aeroplane being recorded by means of a microphone, and angle of the cone of reception determined. It was found that the arrangement gave no magnification, and that the directive results obtained were too indefinite for the system to be usefully employed. Listening wells were accordingly replaced by discs, made either of wood or concrete, of various diameters up to 20 ft., supported on 1 ft. uprights, microphones, as before, being employed. With this arrangement a magnification of twentyfold was obtained, and the directive qualities were found to be as forecasted mathematically. In 1919 tests were carried out to investigate the behaviour of discs in line. Three discs in a line l-i miles apart were employed, and the course of the aeroplane along the line of discs investigated. The acoustical effects were good, and it was found possible to determine the ground-speed accurately. In 1923 experiments were carried out at Biggin Hill with 12 discs placed at the corners of equilateral triangles of 14^ miles side, and the courses of aeroplanes flying in various directions were determined. The course and ground-speed were given with fair accuracy. The method was extended by further tests on Romney Marsh in 1924, when a double line of discs was used as an outpost line for defence. Twenty discs were placed in two rows of 10, the lines being 3 miles apart, and the intervals between the discs in each line half a mile. The course, position and ground-speed were given accurately, but the arrangement did not give dependable results for the height of aeroplanes flying over the discs. This arrangement has later been extended by the installation of 32 discs, with 10 in each line at the same intervals. The results obtained with the previous system were employed, and the arrangement was tested with aeroplanes flying up to a height of 26,000 ft. In general, it has been found that the disc system will locate the leader, but only gives confused results unless the aeroplanes cross the line at intervals of more than one minute apart.16. With a view to improving the records of the discs as regards the determina tion of height, the following investigations are being carried out or are proposed : Trumpet sound-locators have been placed 6 miles apart on the landward line of discs, and altitude readings have been noted when the line was crossed, as given by observa-lions on the discs. By this method heights have been found to within 700 ft. on the average in all cases. The results in the main were satisfactory, but the method requires extra personnel in the field. Experiments are now in progress with the object of determining height by the Doppler effect, by using a cathode ray oscillograph m conjunction with microphones. The results are promising. A theory has also been worked out of a method of employing two microphones to get the height by a combination of a stationary-wave and the Doppler method.
-   Microphones for Aeroplane Detection.17. Improvement both in the mirror and disc systems described above is dependent to a largo extent upon improvements in the microphones used for aeroplane detection, and research has been carried out upon this matter. In 1918 a Helmholtz resonator and a hot-wire microphone with a Whcatstone bridge or amplifier was employed. The combination was found to provide an efficient listening unit, but was of too limited a range. A doubly-resonated hot-wire microphone was next developed, with the object of detecting aircraft, with an extended range of frequency and greater sensitivity. This consisted of the combination of two tube resonators,one of them being similar to that described above. A listening unit of 20 times the sensitivity of the first described, and about 4 times the range of frequency, was produced. Microphones of this type have actually been used in the field with satisfactory results. Recently a microphone of the electrostatic type has been used in conjunction with a sound-gathering device and a cathode ray oscillograph for hinaural listening. The electrostatic microphone is mounted in a trumpet and connected with a high-power amplifier. Good reproduction ami magnification have been obtained, and experiments in this direction arc in progress and are giving promise of success. As a more sensitive means of detecting aeroplanes, a microphone of the vacuum tube type is under consideration, in which the air vibrations are transmitted to an electrode in a thermionic valve. In connection with the sea sound location trials referred to above, two doubly-resonated hot-wire microphones covering the range of frequency of aeroplane sounds have been employed with an amplifier and vibration galvanometer. The combination was found to be highly sensitive to all sounds, but. as stated above, was not effective at sea on account of the difficulty of distinguishing aeroplane from other sounds.Location by Means of Listening Trumpets.18. For sound location at comparatively short ranges, a study of the possibilities of the trumpet sound-locator has been made. Various materials have been experimented with, with a view to a faithful reproduction of the sounds and the avoidance of wind interference. The materials used included wood, lead, tin, Handford sound-proofing material and other light construction materials. The Handford type of trumpet has been found Very effective and has been employed in several models of trumpet sound-locators. It has been found that the walls of the trumpet must be sound-proof and non-resonant for the best results. Experiments have also been carried out on the reduction of disturbances due to wind, gun-fire and local noise. Investigations have been undertaken since 1918 on the subject of the best types of stethoscopes and connecting tubes to be used with the trumpets. Ear defenders have also been developed to protect the ears of observers against shock from explosion. Experiments have also been made to determine the most suitable base-line length between binaural trumpets. Mathematical investigations have been carried out with the object of correcting the lag of sound and refraction effects of the atmosphere when using trumpet sound-locators. The design and trial of eccentrically-mounted ring sights have been carried out. and the results have been found favourable, and this type has been adopted in the Service. A cam-shaped rear sight to avoid eccentric mounting has also been tested, but while more accurate, the principle was found to be more difficult to apply. This type was accordingly not adopted. The sight bar graduated by observation of average air speed of enemy aircraft has also been adopted.19. An investigation has been made of the practicability of using trumpet sound-locators in conjunction with searchlights, in order to get instantaneous transmission of direction of the aeroplane from the sound-locator to the searchlight without interference with listening. One method employed has been a step-by-step motor, the. operating switches of which are attached to the sound-locator. This was an improvement on verbal methods of control. Investigations are being carried out with a view to improvement in the details of the mechanism and with the object of lessening the searchlight personnel to two men per light.20. The design and construction of a binaural sound-locator for use in fixed positions is being undertaken, and advantage is being taken in the work of all pre-vious experimental results. In this connection, comparative examination with the aid of acoustical measuring apparatus is being carried out on paraboloidal and conical
sound receivers of various dimensions. Promising results have been obtained with a 2 ft. 6 in. paraboloid, and 3 ft. and 4 ft. paraboloids are under examination, with a view to determining the optimum base-line for larger receivers. An experimental comparison is being carried out on the results obtained with different lengths of base. Special mountings for this purpose have been designed. An experimental com-parison is also in hand of the results obtained with listening tubes of different diameters and lengths. A theoretical investigation, followed by experimental tests, of improvements of ring sights and the consideration of possible alternatives is also in progress. Experiments are being carried out also with different types of wind screening for the protection of listeners from the disturbances due to wind.Miscellaneous Acoustical Experiments.21. The following miscellaneous acoustical experiments were carried out during the war by the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Establishment of the Munitions Inven-tions Department, with the object of attempting to replace binaural listening by visual indicators. Experiments were made on the reception of sound by diaphragms and the superposition of the beams reflected from these to give Lissajous figures. The method was found to be too susceptible to wind and only capable of working in the laboratory, and has therefore been abandoned. Attempts have also been made to locate an aeroplane by means of two trumpets by electromagnetic methods. The two trumpets were connected together with a tube, the passage being stopped by a diaphragm with an electromagnetic fitting, so that an acoustical balance could be obtained. This apparatus, again, was found to be too sensitive to disturbing noises and wind for use in the field.22. As a means of sound detection by employing diaphragms of various types, the following methods have been tried : (a.) Newton ring method, depending on the interference of light between thediaphragm and curved surface. (b.) Mirage method, depending on the deflection of a stream of air by an . acoustical wave.(c.) Eddy method, depending on the disturbance of smoke eddies by acoustical waves.None of these has proved to be of value.23. In 1925 the Player*s relay was developed for long-distance electrical detection. In this instrument a tuned microphone is coupled with a specially designed loud speaker. Experiments with this apparatus are in progress, and very good results have been obtained up to a range of 12 miles.Selection of Observers for A coirstical Observations.24. Results obtained with acoustical methods of observation indicated that the success of these methods depends largely upon the selection of suitable personnel. Apparatus has accordingly been designed to test the auditory acuity of troops. This apparatus includes an acoustic oscillator and the means of vaxying the strength of audible signals received in telephones. It has been tried by anti-aircraft listeners and other personnel, and also by the medical adviser to the Director of Civil Aviation and at the Middlesex Hospital. The apparatus is capable of giving figures of relative acuity of hearing between different individuals, and provides means for the comparison of them with normal listeners. Tests have been carried out to investigate the binaural faculty of different personnel, and it is believed that about 25 per cent, of listeners are suitable for directional listening. The capacity of troops for sound location has been tested by means of comparison of tracks of aeroplanes found acoustically with those given visually. The average errors varied with elevation and amounted, on the average, to 1-5&quot; in azimuth and 4&quot; in elevation.25. A special installation, simulating the actual conditions in the field and equipped with a model target and model searchlight, has been designed to enable Territorials to be trained and practised in the use of sound-locators indoors, without having aeroplane flights. Three such instruments have been issued to anti-aircraft \mits, and the results obtained are promising.
Other Methods for Detecting the Presence of Hostile Aircraft. 26.   Other methods of detecting aircraft have been considered, as follows :-Induced Electromagnetic Effects.27. Attempts have been made to detect any electromagnetic effect induced during the flight of aeroplanes over a large loop of wire, but the results were inappreciable even at a range of 50 ft., and the method has not been further pursued.Detection of Disturbances due to the Magneto.28. It has been suggested that the electromagnetic radiations from aircraft ignition systems might be used to detect the presence of aircraft, and experiments have been carried out to determine the ranges at which aircraft could be detected by this means. Two series of experiments have been carried out at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. 1 n the first series, three types of receiver were used, and the range of detection was observed for nine types of aircraft. In the second series, lour receivers, covering a wavelength range of from 2-5 to 14 metres, were used to detect the electromagnetic radiations from three types of aircraft having both screened and unscreened ignition systems.29. In the first series of experiments it was found that a receiver working on a wave of about 10 metres gave an extreme range of about 700 yards, but 300 yards was considered to be an average figure. Screening and bonding, as used for short-wave apparatus, appeared to prevent radiation from the aircraft. Screening, as installed for long-wave D.F. work, did not appear entirely to prevent radiation from the ignition system.30. In the second series of experiments, unscreened aircraft were heard up to an extreme range of 2 miles at a height of 2,000 ft. Aircraft with screened engines were heard to an extreme range of 400 yards. In this second series of tests, the Army 5-metre quench receiver was found to be the most sensitive apparatus for detecting the radiations, but it was not found possible to assign any definite wavelength to the radiation.31. Receivers might possibly be developed to increase the range, but increased sensitivity would involve difficulties in operation, and particularly in securing listening sites free from extraneous noises.Heat Radiation.32. Investigations have been carried out by the Admiralty on the detection of heat radiation from aircraft. These show that such radiation could be employed at a range of one or two miles to give a definite indication of the presence of aircraft. The source of heat radiation has, however, been shown in all probability to be definitely located in the engine itself and in its exhaust pipe rather than in the exhaust&apos;gases. In view of this fact, it should be practicable to eliminate heat radiation by suitable lagging or other protection. It is considered, therefore, that the potential value of this method of detection is greatly reduced, and in view of the delicate apparatus required for its application and the skilled personnel needed, further research on the matter is not at present considered to be justified.Searchlights and Illuminating Devices.Searchlights.33.   Investigations on searchlights are being carried out by the Air Defence Establishment of the War Office.  The following investigations are in progress: (a.) Production of a high current density arc.   Increase of source of light.Evolution of a High-current Density lamp suitable for A.A. purposes embodying the most suitable, features of the Naval (Harrison), Sperry, GoerzBeek and other lamps.A suitable lamp has been evolved and is being tried in the field with satisfactory results. [17259] c
(b.) Improved Carbons, having slower rate of burning and giving increased light.An inter-Service carbons committee is working in conjunction with the General  Electric Company.    Improved carbons which win be manufactured in this country have been produced, (c.) Improved rellectors capable of withstanding increased heat necessitated by improved arc.In conjunction with Sir Herbert Jackson and Sir Charles Parsons,a suitable heat-resisting glass has been produced. The optical propertiesof the reflectors have been investigated. (d.) New projectors, lighter and more portable, with mechanical ventilation, foruse with high current density arcs have been made and promisesuccessful results. (e.) Detection through fog and mist.Mirrors with gold and other non-silver backings and carbons givingcoloured arcs have been tried. They show some advantages.   Colouredscreens have been used to reduce scattered light.Revolving Searchlights.34.   To provide rapid means of search and also to produce a barrage, severalwhich proved unworkable, have been tried. Also, methods embodying groups of pro-jectors acting in unison have been given consideration. It was found there was great difficulty in manipulation and that no advantages in illumination were obtained.35. Information in the possession of the War Office as to the French and other foreign nations&apos; equipment appears to show that the French have nothing in advance of what was in use during the war, the Sautter-Harld. The Italians are experimenting with the Sperry and the United States with various forms of equip-ment, principally Sperry, but have nothing beyond the experimental stage; their investigations are on the lines of mobility and increasing the size of the mirror. A certain amount has been published, but enquiries have failed to substantiate the claims set out in anything that has been published.Silhouetting of Enemy Aeroplanes against a Luminous Background.36. Some consideration has been given to the possibility of silhouetting aeroplanes for the benefit of defending aircraft against a luminous background created on the ground, which at the same time screens the ground from above.37. Searchlight Silhouette. Attempts have been made to employ various forms of searchlight beams for this purpose, but the results have been found to be of no practical value. Similarly, attempts have been made to produce a vertical wall or series of fans formed by properly disposed projectors using dispersed beams. Again the results obtained so far are not very satisfactory.38. The Floodlight System. This system entails the use of a 180&quot; floodlight, which strongly illuminates the dust particles and mist in the air over a considerable area, so that an aeroplane flying over the &quot;carpet of light &quot; thus produced will be seen from above as a silhouette. Such a carpet &quot; has been produced by the Chance ISO0 aerodrome floodlight mounted about 30 feet above ground level, with a beam of intensity of 850,000 candles and an area of illumination of roughly one-fifth of a square mile.39. Four flights have been carried out under different weather conditions and the results indicate that  (a.) A silhouette effect can only be produced by the ISO0 aerodrome floodlight under exceptional weather conditions, i.e., ground mist extending not higher than the level of the light with good visibility above.(6.) The silhouette effect, even under the best conditions, is not sufficiently marked, and is too much camouflaged by variations in back-ground illumination to be of practical value in locating an aeroplane.(c.) The only practical method of securing a marked silhouette effect is to use a powerful light vertically above the illuminated area, such as could be produced by parachute flares liberated from an aeroplane at 4,000 to 5,000 feet.arrangements for produciolving complicated mountings

The present position regarding the conveying of information from the ground to defending aircraft may be summarised as follows : (a.) The present wireless installations are such that satisfactory communication can be provided under all likely conditions. Radio telephone receiving sets can be carried by all aircraft. The range of reception is, of course, dependent upon the power of the ground transmitting set; the present requirement is for a range of 35 miles, and this can be provided. Radio telegraphic sets, primarily designed for use on long-range aircraft, are also available having a range of 200 miles.(b.) It is considered that Radio-telegraphic communication is more certain than Radio telephony.(c.) There appears to be no cure for &quot;jamming &quot; by a hostile station, but this is not likely to be encountered when defending home territory.OFFENSIVE ACTION.Anti-Aircraft Guns associated with Predictors.41. The nature of the guns upon which research is being undertaken for anti-aircraft purposes is indicated in the table below. With the exception of the 3 in. 20 cwt. type of gun, all natures of ordnance specified arc dual or triple-purpose weapons, viz., anti-ship, anti-aircraft, and, in some cases, bombardment. Apart from research with the object of the direct development of improved aircraft, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition, the main lines of research laid down by the Fighting Services have the object of assisting the defensive organisation by endeavouring to supply information of the approach of the enemy, and by devising methods for his speedy and precise location.Table I. Particulars of various types of equipment which may be used against aircraft.
Aircraft Predictors.42. Aircraft Predictors arc instruments for determining the data required by the guns to compensate for the travel of the target.43. A considerable amount of work has been done in Service establishments and by outside firms to produce Predictors and a very considerable advance has been made.  Predictors generally may be put in three categories : (a.) Those used at fixed base.(b.) Portable instruments.(c.) Predictors for use in ships.44. The majority of Predictors for use at sea require a stabilised platform for the observing unit. On land, where a stable platform exists, the use of predictors has produced a very marked improvement in practice against aircraft, as the following figures obtained at A.A. Practice Camps show : Percentage of bursts on the line of sight.Year. Direct Fire.   Indirect Fire.Per cent.        Per cent.1924       ... ... ...... 3-81925       ... ... ... ... 7-51926       ... ... ... ... 14-8*1927       ............ 14-4* 27Improvements in instruments and procedure have progressed so far, that it is considered that aircraft attempting to fly on fairly straight courses at all heights up to at least 8,000 feet assuming good visibility will be subjected to a heavy and accurate fire. The accuracy and value of A.A. fire at heights beyond 8,000 feet should be fair, but steadily decreasing in efficiency up to a height of 18,000 feet, which latter is about the practical height limit of the 3-inch A.A. Gun.45. The bulk of the research and experimental work on A.A. predictors is conducted at the Whale Island Gunnery Establishment. Portsmouth, at the School of A.A. Defence. Biggin Hill, and at Army A.A. Artillery Ranges, Watchet.Present Position regaroing Machine and other Gun Fire from Aircraft.Machine Guns.46. Machine guns at present in use have a rate of fire of approximately 700 rounds a minute (650 for the Lewis or observers gun, and 750, or rather more, for the Vickers or pilot&apos;s gun). The accuracy with which these guns can be aimed is of a fairly high order, but the pattern formed by the bullets may be of considerable size under adverse conditions. Under the very best conditions the group obtained is about 10 feet in diameter at 250 yards range. If there is relative motion between the two aircraft the size of the group is increased to about 30 ft, in diameter at this range.47. The size of the group may be considerably increased by the effect of &quot;bumps &quot; on the aircraft; the extent of this effect depends on the natural periods of the aircraft round its axis in flight.48. Improvements in the volume and concentration of fire have taken the following lines: (a.) Mountings have been made as rigid as possible to ensure that the most concentrated group possible can be obtained under any given aerial conditions.(b.) Gun positions are so disposed that the maximum number of guns can be brought to beai on any given point.* The figures fur 1926, 1927 are not directly comparable, as tho weather conditions in 1927 were distinctly adverse, also a large proportion of the 1927 ammunition was used in developing other methods of A.A. Fire Control.
(c.) A new twin gun attachment for observers&apos; use has been developed which will enable the volume of fire to be doubled in special cases.(d.) Improved sights are being developed which will enable very accurate laying to be carried out. By adopting special tactics a sufficient time interval can be obtained in certain cases to enable such a sight to be used. This, in conjunction with a more concentrated group, willenable longer ranges to be used.Coventry Ordnance Works Gun.49. A method of using the Coventry Ordnance Works gun or other heavy weapon, at greatly increased ranges, has been developed and the necessary automatic sights designed. The first installation has been used in initial tests with the following results : Target 4 ft. diameter, tapering to 2 ft. in a length of 18 ft.     Speed 85 m.p.h.  Range 800 yards. Six rounds fired. Three rounds observed. One direct hit. One graze. One 2 ft. left.50. On the second occasion under similar conditions two direct hits were obtained in eight rounds fired, and those observed were very close misses.51. Theoretical considerations indicate that these ranges can probably be doubled in the case of the Coventry Ordnance Works gun without a serious decrease in accuracy. The following are particulars of the present calibre and rate of fire of the gun : Calibre of Shell: 1-47 in.  Weight: H lb. Rate of Fire (a.) Rate of Fire of 1 magazine (6 rounds) : 2 rounds per sec. (6.) Continuous rate of fire is 17 rounds per minute.Attack on Formation by Time Bomb Droppeo from Above.52. The Air Ministry are investigating the possibility of the development of a very accurate fuse capable of detonating a bomb at a predetermined distance below the aircraft from which it is released, with a view to attacking formations of enemy aircraft in such a way as (a.) To cause casualties to the aircraft in the formation and/or(6.) Cause the formation to break up so that the individual aircraft may be attacked by fighting aircraft.53. This requirement is being met by the provision of a fuse containing a high-speed clockwork mechanism which is adjustable in 40ths of a second between 3 and 60 seconds. The pallet makes 86-63 complete oscillations per second. This mechanism is set in operation by the first H rotations of an arming vane which spins as the bomb falls. About 24 turns of the arming vane are required to arm the fuze completely. In order that the bomb may be dropped over friendly territory, the fuze is designed so that if it failed to function on time it would be blind on striking the ground. It is designed to be suitable for use in any of the more recent designs of H.E. bombs.54. Trials with this fuze have indicated that the clockwork mechanism is entirely satisfactory, but that further experiments will be necessary with a view to ensuring that the mechanism starts running immediately the bomb leaves the aircraft. A fuze setter is also required in order to adjust the fuze more accurately than is possible by hand.[17259] d 2
Pilotless Aircraft.55. The possible use of pilotless aircraft as a means of defence against hostile aeroplanes is receiving consideration. The investigations being carried out are as indicated below.Ram Pilotless Aircraft.56. Consideration has been given to the possibility of developing a small and very manoeuvrable type of pilotless aircraft for the purpose of disorganising bombing formations by charging them from the rear, as a preliminary to attack by fighters. It is intended that these aircraft shall have a high performance and shall be radio-controlled from the air, or from the ground for purposes of landing. Since in general they will be employed against enemy aircraft operating over this country, the possibility of jamming is not of great importance.57. The development of the Ram pilotless aircraft is in a very early stage, no aircraft of this type having yet been built. The results of experience gained with the wireless-controlled aerial target have, however, been applied to the wireless control of a Wolf aircraft carrying a pilot. This aircraft has been taken off under wireless control and manoeuvred satisfactorily.58. The apparatus consists of a receiver, a receiving relay unit, and a new form of selector; the selector has been arranged to provide 12 controls with an extension to 24 controls if required, but so far only 6 controls have been used on the Wolf.59. No actual control apparatus for use specifically with the Ram has been developed, but experience gained in the design of apparatus for the Wolf has indicated the lines of design it will be necessary to follow for the Ram equipment. Although it has been found that the Wolf answers signals satisfactorily, the speed with which this aircraft can at present be manoeuvred is inadequate for the Ram. Experiments are to be continued on another type of aircraft carrying a pilot, and special attention is being directed to obtaining more rapid control.60. It has been suggested that the remote control of aircraft might be effected by means of a beam of light emitted from a controlling aircraft and incident upon a photo-electric cell installed in the controlling aircraft. This form of control would appear to have two advantages over wireless control: (i) secrecy, characteristic of beam control, except that it would be necessary to use non-visible wave lengths at night, and (ii) signals would be unjammable. It was therefore decided to conduct tests at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, in order to examine the possibilities of this form of remote control.61. Tests were carried out at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, the source of light being a one kilowatt arc with an 11 in. mirror, having a focal length of 6 in. Potassium, caesium and rubidium gas-filled cells were each used in conjunction with a two-valve amplifier to control a relay. Tests were carried out mostly at night, but one or two experiments were made during the day.62. The use of ultra violet and infra red light has been considered, but no experiments have been carried out with these wave lengths.63. The maximum range obtained was 3,000 yards at night with the potassium gas-filled cell. Under similar conditions, the caesium and rubidium cells gave not more than 1,000 yards range; there was a slight haze on each occasion. With the potassium gas-filled cell, the sensitivity was such that the relay could be operated by an illumination of one-fifth of a candle metre. In daylight no useful ranges were obtained.64. In view of the necessity for using a narrow beam and the consequent difficulty in maintaining contact between controlling and controlled machines at night, and also on account of the unsuitability, for different reasons, of both ultra violet and infra red rays, it is not considered that the method of control by light rays is likely to be successful at night.   It is unfortunate that ultra violet rays, to which
Balloon Barrage.(High Altitude Balloon with tapering cable.)65. A method of defence against hostile aircraft has been suggested, consisting of an apron of wires suspended between captive balloons and forming an aerial screen. In order to deal with bombing aircraft at high altitude, it is necessary to design a balloon having a much greater ceiling than the present observation balloon (5,000 feet). It has been suggested that the weight of the cable, on which the ceiling largely depends, should be reduced by adopting a tapering form.66. Two special high-altitude balloons have been designed of the non-rigid type and of cubic capacities of 235,000 cubic feet and 300,000 cubic feet; the latter is not yet completed, but the former has undergone a preliminary test for stability at 1,000 feet in a 17 m.p.h. wind with satisfactory results. This balloon is 60 feet diameter, 160 feet long and weighs 1-7 tons.67. The cable is made up of six sections, decreasing in diameter from the balloon end, which has a breaking strength of (d-\ tons to the winch end, which has a breaking strength of 5f tons. Ihe estimated weight of this cable for a 30,000-feet run is 3-15 tons, compared with a weight of 4 tons for an equal length of uniform cable having a breaking strength of 9A tons.68. The winch is not yet constructed, but it is designed to be carried on a trailer and is driven by a 240-h.p. engine; it will accommodate 33,000 feet of cable.69. As a result of the preliminary test on the smaller balloon, it is estimated that in still air the balloon will attain a height of 19,000 feet, and a height of 20.000 feet in a wind of 20 miles per hour.PART II.RECOMMENDATIONS.70. In order to make deductions as to the practical usefulness of instruments which have been developed for the detection and location of aircraft, and the possibilities of a successful outcome of the Avork which is in hand, we have been led to consider Anti-aircraft research according to the following scheme : 71. We have considered first of all the scientific principles involved, and we state our conclusions regarding the scientific practicability and soundness of the various lines of attacking the problems. We have then considered the relation to requirements (so far as we know them) of the results which have been obtained or are likely to be obtained with the specific forms of apparatus dealt with in the preceding portion of the report.72. We have found it desirable, in indicating the directions in which research might be prosecuted, to consider to some extent the limitations of the material dealt with in the report, and &quot;the weight which must be attached to these limitations in assessing the probable military value of the methods of defence which have been proposed.photo-electric cells are generally most sensitive, are more easily absorbed by the atmosphere than rays of longer wave length, and that infra red rays, which are able rather more easily to penetrate the atmosphere, have less effect on photo-electric cells. Moreover, no satisfactory source of infra red rays capable of being carried and maintained on aircraft is yet available. The difficulties encountered in using photo-electric cell by day and the operational difficulties involved in shrouding the cell, are considered to make it a less promising method of control than that by wireless, more especially in view of the fact that, with the power which would probably be necessary for the light source in the controlling machine, wireless signals of unjammable strength could be used for the control.
DETECTION.73. As regards the detection of aircraft, we consider that Part I of our report definitely shows that the only system which can be applied at present with any hope of success is the acoustical system. The scientific principles underlying the use of acoustic instruments arc sound, but the method is limited with respect to long-range types by meteorological conditions. How far these limitations can be minimised appears to us to depend upon the results of the fundamental investigations on meteorological acoustics described in Part I. We recommend that the following investigations be continued : (a.) Meteorological research.(6.) Analysis of aeroplane sounds.We also consider that it has been definitely shown that at present acoustical instruments must be employed on land for satisfactory results. Again, however, the results of further investigations on the analysis of sound and meteorological acoustics may lead to a modification of this opinion. As regards listening in the air, it is considered that the difficulties encountered in listening in captive balloons might not apply equally to listening in free balloons and airships, We recommend that experiments to test this point should be made when the opportunity arises.74. As regards listening at sea, it is believed that a solution of the problem can only be looked for in designing listening apparatus sensitive to a note of a definite frequency present in an aeroplane sound, but which is not present, or if so, to a very small extent, in the general noise due to ships&apos; machinery, &amp;c. We recommend accordingly that the development of listening apparatus for use at sea should be postponed pending the completion of the investigation on the analysis of aeroplane sounds.75. The Air Ministry requirements as regards detection of enemy aircraft may be summarised as follows : (a). Aeroplanes shall be detected at ranges of 25 miles and their approximate bearing measured.(6.) The approximate course, speed, height and number of the enemy shall be known before they are within 10 miles of the coast, (c.) The course, speed, height and number of the enemy must be knownaccurately as soon as they cross the coast. (d.) Mobile location apparatus should be developed.76. As regards the first of the above requirements, it is expected that the suggested 200 feet mirror will detect bombing aircraft flying at a height of not less than 10,000 feet at a distance of 25 miles on more than 50 per cent, of the possible flying days. It is also believed that the dimensions of the mirror will be such as to enable advantage to be taken of low frequency waves, which are not so readily absorbed by the atmosphere. With regard to direction, it is believed that aeroplanes will be located and separated when their angular separation exceeds 6D of arc. We strongly recommend that the construction of the proposed 200 feet mirror should be proceeded with, as representing at present the most practical means for long-distance listening. We would remark, however, that the phenomena which cause zones of silence round the source of sound (referred to in the section in Part I dealing with meteorological acoustics) may indicate a fresh approach to the long range detection of aircraft.77. It is believed that requirement (b) above can be met by the employment, of 20-feet mirrors disposed at distances of 8 miles apart as far as course and ground speed of the enemy are concerned. The limitation imposed by the refraction ot sound in the atmosphere prevents an accurate estimate of height. The determination of number presents considerable difficulties. With regard to single machines the error of location should not be greater in general than 2&quot;. With compact formations an approximate bearing for the middle of the flight is obtained. We recommend that investigations with the 20-feet mirrors should be continued and that a system of location employing them should be developed.
7S. As stated in requirement (c), when the enemy have passed the coast-line the course, speed, height and number arc required to be known accurately. The employment of mirrors presents considerable difficulties when used to obtain an accurate direction for an overhead target travelling with a high angular velocity. It would be necessary to arrange mirrors with their axis vertical at two miles or less apart. Such an arrangement, with its lines of communications and telephones, would make the work of computing laborious and complicated, and would also employ a large personnel. The same objection applies equally to sound locators which might replace the mirrors. A further possibility is the employment of a line of vertical mirrors ten miles back, used as described in long-distance listening, but such an arrangement would give no information of height, and insufficient accuracy with regard to course and ground-speed. We believe that requirement (c) can be met Ik\si by the disc system which, among other advantages, is automatic. We appreciate the limitations of any detecting system and realise that a watch on a line, as distinct from an area, lends itself more readily to defeat by misleading manoeuvres on the part of enemy aircraft. We recommend, however, that the development of the disc system should be continued.70. A mobile instrument to meet requirement (d) is valuable also for use with searchlights. In conjunction with searchlights and with properly trained personnel we consider that trumpet sound-locators have been a success. These instruments are not intended for longe-range listening. It is believed that these instruments can be developed to locate and distinguish between aeroplanes which are in a locality at the same time. The principles involved in the fixed sound-locator will be capable of application to a field type of instrument. We recommend that the development of the trumpet sound-locator should be continued and, at the same time, that the design of the proposed trumpet sound-locator for use in fixed positions should be proceeded with.SO. For the information of the Main Committee, the following particulars respecting costs are given : Approximate Cost.  (a.) 200 ft. Mirror ... ... ... ...      5,000(h.) 20 ft. Mirror ... ... ... ... 500(c.) Disc ... ... ... ... ... 40(d.) Trumpet Sound-Locator (latest field model)       ... 63In each case the figure given is exclusive of any land-line connections, &amp;c.SI. It has been suggested that methods should be developed which would be applicable to silent aircraft. Obviously the value of acoustical methods of detection would completely vanish if there were any real possibility of the silencing of aircraft. The noise of the aircraft as heard by the observer is mainly due to the noise of the engine and the air-screw, although a considerable amount of high-frequency sound is produced by vibration of stays, &amp;c. The noise of the engine can be reduced to a considerable extent, but no substantial reduction has yet been effected in the noise of the air-screw. In addition to the sound directly associated with the air-screw revolutions, blade vibration is also a cause of noise. This latter, however, may be reduced to some extent by suitable design. It is not anticipated that any aeroplane will be constructed that will not give out a considerable amount of sound. We do not consider, therefore, that the possibility of silencing aircraft should prevent the development of acoustical methods of detection. It may be added that some consideration has been given to the possibility of detecting aeroplanes by echo, but no experimental work has yet been dune on this subject. We have no specific recommendation to make with regard to the detection of silent aircraft other than by visual means, but as ideas arise which appear worthy of investigation even-facility should be given for trial.82. We recommend that experiments undertaken with a view to the improve-merit of searchlights should be continued.83. We consider that the proposal for silhouetting aeroplanes against a luminous background created on the ground presents serious difficulties and holds out insufficient prospects to justify work being continued.
OFFENSIVE ACTION.84. As regards guns and instruments associated with them, Part I explains the present position and possibilities as regards prediction. Obviously the devclop-raent of A.A. gunnery is a matter of the utmost importance and research is vital.This research should include : (a.) Increased accuracy of height finding. (b.) Improvements to fuzes.We recommend that research in the development of guns, ammunition, predictors and accessories should be continued.85. As regards time bombs, it is recommended that in addition to continuing the work already in hand, experiments should be made with light-case bombs (blast effect) and heavy-case bombs (fragmentation).86. With regard to experiments with pilotless aircraft, we consider that the light method of control does not offer any advantages over wireless control. We recommend, therefore, that the efforts of investigators should be directed to attempts to develop pilotless aircraft controlled by wireless radiation.  Other possible methodsS7. As regards the development of kite balloon barrages of great height, we understand that a kite balloon capable of rising to a height of 20,000 feet would require to have a capacity of not less than 235,000 cubic feet and would cost approxi-mately  5,000; gas, cable and winch not being included. In view of the limited area which a few such balloons would defend, together with the vulnerable nature of the balloons and the high cost involved, the feasibility of a balloon barrage at an altitude of 20,000 feet appears to us to be questionable. We understand that the production of two such balloons is being proceeded with, and that experiments will be made. We make, however, no recommendation as to further lines of research connected with balloon barrages.(Signed)F. E. SMITH (Chairman).G. R. PRIDHAM.H. E. WIMPERIS.(Signed)O. F.
