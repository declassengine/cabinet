Copy No. 29

CABINET.

PROPOSED ZIONIST LOAN.

Memorandum by the Treasury, circulated by direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

1. The Memorandum by Sir O.E. Niemeyer, Chairman of the Financial Committee of the League of Nations, which is being circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,Ø shows conclusively that there is no prospect of an application by the Zionist Organisation for a guarantee under the aegis of the League of Nations meeting with any success.

2. An independent guarantee by the British Government would be open to grave objection, for the following reasons:-

(a) It is hardly necessary to remind the Cabinet of the paramount importance of maintaining British Government credit at the present time. We have just got rid of the incubus of guaranteed loans designed for development of our own trade. To open the door again to such concessions, unless the need were overwhelmingly great, would be disastrous.

(b) In this case it cannot be said that the need is urgent. The Zionist Organisation claims to have a steady income of nearly £700,000 per annum. With such resources it is absurd to pretend that they could not raise a loan of £2,000,000 privately, without assistance either from the League or from His Majesty&apos;s Government. Indeed,

Ø C.P. 110 (28).
with so large an income it is by no moans clear that further provision by way of loau is rosily necessary.(c) Tho objsctions indicated by Sir 0. Kiemoyer (paragraph (7) of his memorandum) to giving a guarantee to a privato organisation instead of a responsible Government apply with equal force to a British Government guarantee.(d) The lord President of tho Council argues that Palestine has be on tree ted les3 favoiirably than IraqTho conditions of the two countries are so different that comparison in hardly possible;    but at least in ths matter of guarantee Palestine has no cause to complain. ?/hile Iraq has had nothing, Palestine was allowed only a year  go to raise a loan, guaranteed by ths British Government, of  4,500.000-     To give her a further guarantee now, for the benefit of a particular section of tho community, and for tho vague purposes indicated in tbe promoters&apos; Ksaoran&amp;tua,  is certain to provoke vigorous criticism, to 7/h/j.oh it would bo difficult to find rn answer without encouraging the belief that the Government was again about to embark on a general policy of guaranteed loans for development end other purposes.X   CP.  71  (28).Treasury Chambers, S.W.1, April 2nd, 1928.
