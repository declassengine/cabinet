j This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1928.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.CP. 106 (28).CABINET.29INTER-DEPABTMENTAL   COMMITTEE   ON   THE   CIVIL EMPLOYMENT 01-&apos; EX-REGULAR SAILORS, SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN.Report to the Lords Commissioners ok His Ma.?esty&apos;s Treasury; (Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.)May it Please Your Lordships,1. We were appointed by Treasury Minute dated the 3rd November, 1926, to consider the question of finding suitable employment in civil life for those who have served on regular engagements in the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force, and to make recommendations.2. In the earlier stages of our enquiry we had the advantage of the assistance of Lieutenant-General Sir R. D. Whigharn, K.C.B.. K.C.M.G., D.S.O., late Adjutant-General to the Forces, and of Colonel G. D. Jebb, C.M.G., C.B.E., D.S.O., late Deputy-Director of Recruiting and Organisation.8. It has been the policy of successive Governments to encourage and assist the absorption into civil employment of men who served in the Great War, whether upon regular or upon temporary engagements, and special efforts have been made to provide suitable occupations for men disabled by war service.As regards Government employment, a definite preference has been promised and given to men with war service, and any measures designed to improve the prospects of employment of men passing out of the regular forces of the Crown must obviously be consistent with the strict observance of the pledges given to the &apos;* hostilities *&apos; men who served in the Great War.-1. The annual outflow from the Regular Forces of the Crown is in the neighbourhood of 80,000 to -10,000 men, whose ages range generally from 21 to 46 years. The State itself can only absorb a relatively small proportion of this total, and it is clear that for a complete and effective solution of the problem the co-operation of outside employers of labour is indispensable.5. It has for some time been the practice of the Service Departments to associate themselves with the appeals of voluntary associations having for their object the provision of employment fcr ox-regular members of the Forces; and we have given careful consideration to the question whether a similar appeal made by His Majesty*s Government would be effective. In this connection we have naturally attached much weight to the evidence of the representatives of the Ministry of Labour.    We are of opinion[17447] n
that, valuable us are the results arising from the existing arrangements, it would be difficult for the Government to maintain a continuously effective appeal to employers generally, which stressed the claims of ex-regulars merely in virtue of their service with the Forces. The effect of a single appeal on these lines would at best be transient and, in the opinion of the representatives of the Ministry of Labour, the present condition of industry does not offer a favourable prospect of even temporary success. In the long run the most effective assistance which the State can give is to see to it that the qualifications possessed by ex-regular candidates for various kinds of employment are brought prominently to the notice of prospective employers.6. Recent developments in the organisation and training of the Navy. Army and Air Force have increased the number of men who leave the Service as skilled tradesmen: and the available evidence indicated that there has hitherto been little or no difficulty in absorbing these skilled men in outside industry after the termination of their colour service. Some improvement might be possible, however, in the existing machinery by which this industrial asset of certain ex-regulars is brought to the notice of employers.7. Similarly, the educational standard of regular members of the Forces is markedly higher than in former years. The development of the Army Educational Scheme and of vocational training at such centres as Aldershot, Ilounslow and Chisledou also enables some of the men leaving the Colours to attain a considerable knowledge of certain trades in which there is a demand for semi-skilled labour.8. While, however, a general appeal would be of doubtful value, every opportunity should be taken (for instance, on suitable occasions in Parliament) of drawing public attention to the qualifications possessed by ex-regulars for civilian employment and of emphasising the advantage which would accrue to the community as a whole from the absorption into productive employment of men whose sole handicap is their withdrawal from the ordinary labour market for a period of years during which they have rendered essential service to the State. We recommend, further, that a scheme should be prepared by the Ministry of Labour in consultation with the Service Departments, providing for full co-operation between the officers of local commands, the Employment Exchange organisation, and voluntary societies. The scheme should be sufficiently elastic to suit special requirements, and provision should be made for registering the qualifications of serving members of the Forces some time before their discharge and for furnishing them with cards of introduction to prospective employers. In the case of men with no preference for any particular place of residence, advice would be forthcoming from the Ministry of Labour, as to the areas affording the best prospects of employment according to their qualifications.9. The scheme should also provide for consultation between the Ministry of Labour and the Service Departments as to the character of the training to be given at vocational training centres and the branches of industry offering from time to time the best opportunities of absorbing men possessed of the degree of skill attainable after attendance at these centres.10. These and similar measures would, without conferring special privileges in the general labour market upon ex-regulars as such, appreciably compensate them for the handicaps under which they labour by reason of their temporary withdrawal from outside industry.11. While we are of opinion that the existing machinery of the Ministry of Labour should bo more fully utilised in favour of ex-regulars on the linos indicated above, we acknowledge the valu-able work which has been and is being done in this direction by
voluntary organisations such as the National Association for Employ-ment of Regular Sailors. Soldiers and Airmen. This organisation has built up a considerable &quot;goodwill&quot; among various classes of employers, who have tested hy experience the value of the training of the ex-regular service man in regard to physical fitness, and habits of discipline, punctuality and smartness: and we think that in the operation of any scheme such as that outlined above, the co-operation of such voluntary organisations is an essential factor of success. But we gathered from the evidence given to us on behalf of the Associa-tion that its organisation does not embrace the whole country; and that even though the assistance of regimental associations and local voluntary organisations is being sought, it is not possible in this way to cover all the areas in which ex-regulars may be seeking employ -mont, or in which facilities for their absorption exist. We are con-vine ed. therefore, that it is essential to supplement the efforts of these voluntary organisations by use of the Employment Exchange system, and we would emphasise that we are aiming, not at coin-petition, hut at co-operation between the official and the voluntary organisations.12. While we have dealt in the first place with the absorption of ex-regulars into employment in outside industry, since it is there that the largest number of posts is available, we fully realise the obligation of the Government to set an example in its own Service; and we have consequently devoted close consideration to the ways and means hy which the already substantial number of ex-regulars employed in the Government service may be increased.18. It is essential in Government employment that the appoint-ment of ex-Service men should be confined to persons who are qualified to perform the duties required of them, and any preference given to men on leaving His Majesty&apos;s Forces can only operate to the extent that suitable candidates are forthcoming. The indication given below of the number of posts which we regard as primd facie presenting opportunities for the absorption of ex-regular candidates must not therefoie be taken to imply that we propose that these posts should be reserved for ex-regulars. All that we feel able to suggest is that, when vacancies arise in the grades indicated, available ex-regular candidates (subject always to the fulfilment of pledges to ex-service men who served in the Great War! shall first be considered.1-1. The Clerical Classes of the Service have since the War been almost entirely recruited from adult ex-service men and adult ex-temporary women employees, who have been required, as a con-dition of establishment, to satisfy qualifying tests differing widely from those of the competitive examinations designed for secondary schoolboys and schoolgirls of the age of 10 to 17 which were conteni-plated as the normal mode of entry to the Clerical Classes set up on the re-organisation of the Civil Service in 1919-20. These special measures were dictated by the requirements of the policy of post-war resettlement; but their result has been to introduce into the clerical grades an undue proportion of middle-aged or elderly persons, whose employment will give rise to increasingly difficult problems of organisation and promotion as time goes on. In several other grades the temporary abandonment of normal methods of recruit-ment has led to similar results.15. There are insuperable objections to the appointment of men sifter completing their colour service to grades which are normally filled by open competition with age limits varying from 1(5 to 18, and we fear that it is impracticable to do more than continue the existing concession whereby ex-membors of the Forces are allowed, for the purpose of the prescribed ago limits, to deduct from their actual age time spout in the Fighting Services.16. The scope of the investigation is thus limited to subordinate posts which can effectively he recruited from adult candidates on the strength of qualifications possessed hy men who have given a period of their lives to regular service in the Forces.[17447] b 2
In the Civil and Revenue Departments there exist some 53,000 such posts, which may be roughly classified as follows : (a.) Posts for which specialised skill is not a necessary condition of candidature : (i.) Post Office (allowing for the reservation of a pro-portion of posts for promotion outlets to existing Post Office Services) Postmen            ............... -25.000Porters   .................. 2,000Cleaners           ............... 2.000Night telephonists, liftmen. &amp;c.        ...      ... 1,500Labourers        ............... 7.000(ii.) Prison officers...............     2.200(iii.) Mercantile Marine Department (including Coast-guard)    ..................      1.000(iv.) Warehousemen, storekeepers, &amp;c. ...      ...     1.0(H)(v.) Messengers. porters. laboratory assistants, customs watchers. museum attendants, museum warders, male cleaners, unskilled labourers, caretakers    ............     7.100(b.) Posts requiring skilled training, such as artificers under the Department of Scientific and Indus-trial Research, skilled tradesmen under Office of Works and Prison Commission, motor mechanics, observers, craftsmen in museums, civil assistants under the Ordnance Survey, semi-skilled labourers in the Forestry Depart-ment, and establishments of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research     ...      ...     3.1)0017. The great majority of the posts under (a) are already filled by ex-regulars or ex-service men who served on a duration of war engagement. For the most part these men have given efficient service, and there should be little difficulty in continuing, for the ex-regular, the preference which has for the past nine years been given to ex-service men generally. So far indeed as employment in certain grades in the Post Office, in the Coastguard, in the Watcher Service, and as messengers in the Government service generally is concerned, there existed even before 1914 a practice of giving pre-ference, if not of confining recruitment, to ex-regular members of the forces, subject, in the case of the Post Office, to the reservation of a sufficient number of posts for the absorption of a proportion of the boy messenger staff. We agree that the existing practice of leaving open avenues of promotion within the Civil Service should he maintained.18. In class (b), however, owing to the need for more stringent selection, it will only be possible to attain the object of employing the maximum number of ex-regulars as Departments become convinced, from experience of the quality of candidates submitted, that the ex-regulars can provide as good material as ex-service men who had received training in some skilled trade before joining up for war service.19. As regards the machinery of recruitment, it is necessarv to provide for (i.) The observance of Government pledges to the various classes of ex-service men who served in the Great War, whether as regulars or on a duration of war engagement.(ii.) The maintenance in all districts of suitable machinery for placing men possessing the necessary qualifications for the various classes of posts to be filled.(iii.) The prevention of the engagement of chance candidates who. by applying direct for employment, anticipate competitors who have followed instructions to register with the agency recognised by the Service Departments.20. The pledges of the Government as regards the envploy-ment of ex-service men (regulars or others) who served in the
Great War provide in the ease of certain grades for a preference to ex-service men who have been discharged from the Civil Service on reductions of stall&quot;, and in all cases for a first preference to disabled men. The preference to men who have been discharged from the Government service is safeguarded by the Joint Substitution Hoard and its Divisional Selection Committees in the provinces: and. for the grades to which this preference applies, Departments should continue to apply to that Hoard for candidates... 21. The preference to disabled men is safeguarded by instructions issued to employing) Departments. The machinery of the -Joint Substitution Hoard secures that the names of disabled men are duly put forward for consideration by the employing Departments in the case of grades recruited through that body. Tn other cases the procedure should follow the lines of the system agreed for the recruitment of postmen. Under this system vacancies an? divided into the two categories of &quot; disabled &quot; and &quot;able-bodied&quot; according as they are or are not suitable for disabled men. (he order of preference within these categories being (a.) Ex-regulars who served in the Great War or earlier. (b.) Men   who  served  on   a  duration  of  war engagement 1914-18.(c.) Ex-regulars who joined the forces after 11th November. 1918.Vacancies are filled through local Employment Exchanges acting in conjunction with the National Association.22. Careful selection of candidates for Government omploy-ment is essential if Departments are to co-operate in the effort to employ ex-regulars as far as possible. From some points of view it is perhaps regrettable that the intervention of the agency of the employment exchange or the Joint Substitution Board, which is inevitable in order to safeguard existing preferences, should prevent personal contact between the representative of the Department having vacancies and the officer of the National Association, who may have intimate knowledge of the qualifications of particular candidates. At the same time, employment exchange officers are well versed in the art of selecting suitable men for different classes of post, and their experience should be of value to the agents of the National Association. What is clearly needed is close co-operation between officers of the Joint Substitution Hoard or the Employment Exchange organisation and the agencies of the National Association with a view to putting the latter in possession of the exact requirements of the Departments having vacancies.23. Certain Departments maintain their own waiting lists of ex-regular candidates for employment. It is argued that these domestic arrangements (which are brought to the notice of possible candidates by the &quot;&apos; Guide to Civil Employment &quot; issued by the War Office, and are to that extent officially recognised) are convenient, in that they tend to eliminate at an early stage obviously unsuitable candidates and provide Departments with an effective waiting list which can be drawn upon at short notice. On the other hand, it may be argued (a.) That  such waiting lists involve unnecessary aud oftenunproductive labour within the Department. (U.) That it is almost impossible for individual departments tokeep their lists up to date, and that an out-of-datewaiting list is worse than useless, (c.) That the Officers of employment agencies will rapidly gainexperience of tho type of qualification required for anyparticular post.21. On balance it appears desirable generally to discourage the system of Departmental Waiting Lists: and it is suggested that an early opportunity should be taken of amending the &quot;Guide to Civil Employment&quot; accordingly. Until this amendment becomes widely known there will undoubtedly be a number of direct applicants to
Departments for employment, but such applicants should be instructed to register with the recognised local agency of the National Association, to which the Departments should hence-forward apply, through the Employment Exchange, whenever vacancies arise. It would remain open to Departments to indicate the names of any specially suitable candidates making direct applica-iion. and as a matter of convenience to transfer existing lists of applicants to (lie National Association.&quot;lit.   There remain for consideration the following points : (a.i Preference to disabled men orer non-disabled menAs between ex-regulars in these categories, there need he no difficulty in observing the Governments undertaking.As between an ex-duration of war disabled man and an ex-regular non-disabled man. it is considered that the preference need only operate when the former is unemployed or in part-time Government employment: that is to say. there is no need to seek unemployed disabled candidates for Government employment outside the live registers of employment exchanges or the live Register of the Joint Substitution Board. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to the preference given, c.g., in Post Office appointments, to men who served during the Great War. over men who enlisted thereafter.(b. i The appointment to Government posts of ex-reijnlars already in employment&apos;.Ex-regular candidates registered with the National Association for Government employment succeed from time to time in obtaining outside employment, but do not notify the Association, or if they do. request that their names may be kept on the register for Government employment. It is understood that the War Office attach importance to keeping ex-regular applicants&apos; names on the list available for Government employment so long as the applicants so desire, and the Joint Substitution Board have recently agreed to nominate ex-regular candidates who are in employment (thus departing from their usual practice) on the understanding that no guarantee can in present circumstances he given of the permanency of appointments so obtained. The Post Office similarly accept ex-regular candidates on the books of the National Association who. having registered for Post Office employment have secured employment in outside industry.2(5. We fully appreciate the arguments against this course. On the other hand, men enlisting in the Regular Forces are promised special consideration, on completion of their service, for civil employ -ment under the Government, and are invited to register their names for such employment before their engagements have expired. It is. in our view, manifestly unfair and inexpedient that such an applicant should be compelled to sacrifice his ultimate prospect of a Govern-ment post unless he is content to remain unemployed for an indefinite period. We recommend, therefore, that an ex-regular applicant should he entitled to keep his place on the register for Government appointments, if he so desires, even if he obtains a permanent situa-tion elsewhere. But Government employment of a casual character should not be ottered to a man who is known to be employed.27. The principle of giving preference, whenever possible, to qualified ex-regular candidates should be applied in the recruitment of subordinate civilian posts in the Service Departments. Of non-clerical subordinate jwsts in the Service Departments outside the Royal Dockyards, the Royal Ordnance Factories and the Royal Air-craft Establishment, we understand that the groat majority are now reserved for ex-service men. provided that suitable candidates are available. We recognise, however, that in those establishments it is unlikely that qualified ex-regular candidates will be forthcoming to fill some of the more skilled posts, and that, moreover, some pro-vision is necessary for the absorption of. at any rate, a proportion of the juveniles employed in those establishments whose claims cannot justly he ignored. It is also unavoidable that a limitation should he placed on the number of reservists employed in these establishments.  We are of opinion that, subject to these considera-
tions, the field of ex-service candidates should be fully explored before resort is had to candidates who have not served in His Majesty&apos;s Forces.28. The question of the agencies through which ex-regular candidates may he absorbed into civilian posts under the Service Departments is not free from difficulty. It is natural that, in the civil establishments nltacheij to Depots, Pay and Record Offices, fee., the general tendency &quot;should be to employ ex-members of the corps with which the particular establishment is connected, and we are not disposed to suggest any radical departure from this practice. At the same lime, the suggestions we have made above as to the general machinery for placing ex-regulars in. employment depend for their efficiency upon the recognition by all concerned that the Employment Exchanges, in collaboration with the National Association and. through it. with regimental associations, will be utilised by all departments in the recruitment of ex-regular personnel for civil posts. Appointments made otherwise than through the recognised channels cannot fail to beget a want of confidence in the system as a whole: and we suggest, therefore, that the Service Departments should follow the general procedure of applying through the local Employment Exchange for candidates for any vacancy that may arise. It would, of course, be open to any sub-department closely connected with a particular arm or corps, to indicate that it was desired to fill the vacancy from among ex-members of the corns in question, and other things being equal we consider that such a preference may properly he exercised.2!). Another avenue of employment lies in the Municipal services. While we are fully sensible that candidates for the Police Forces must possess personal qualifications of a particular character to fit them for the duties of the police, we consider that the inclusion in the Police Force of men otherwise suitable, who have had experience of previous service under discipline in the Regular Forces, cannot fail to react favourably upon the general efficiency of the Police. In this view we understand that the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland concur, subject to the proviso (with which we agree) that, having regard to the range and importance of the duties which would devolve upon the Police on the outbreak of war. no police force should include in its strength an undue proportion of ex-regulars with a current reserve liability.30. In the case of the -Army and the Royal Air Force the period of reserve service does not normally exceed nine years as a maximum, and is generally considerably less: so that it might be possible, consistently with this principle, to employ a considerable number of men who at one time or another have been reservists.31. The existing arrangements for the recruitment of Police Forces both in England and in Scotland provide for the extension of the normal age limits in the case of men who have served in the Regular Forces, and we think it probable that an appreciable number of the men who leave the Regular Forces under the age of 30 will be found to be eminently qualified fur Police Service.32. There exist under several local authorities a considerable number of posts of a character similar to those in the Government service which in paragraphs IG-18 of our Report have been described as suitable for ex-regular candidates. The fulfilment of pledges to the various classes of men who served in the Great War may. of course, be a liability which must he met before ex-regulars, who did not so serve, are appointed to the posts in question. Moreover, we recognise that many local authorities may he confronted by special local problems of unemployment and the like which call for special treatment.38, In such circumstances wo doubt the expediency of a general appeal to local authorities to pledge themselves to an unconditional preference, in all cases, for ex-regular candidates for employment. It would be better to approach local authorities on the same lines as
private employers, and to use every opj)ortunity of placing before them fail information as to the qualifications of ex-regular candidates for the posts at their disposal. To a great extent this object will be achieved by the machinery suggested in paragraphs 9 and 10 of our report; and we think that the Minister of Health and the Scottish Board of Health might be requested to bring to the notice of local authorities the existence of this machinery, while leaving it open to the authorities concerned to decide to what extent they can utilise it.8-4.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : (i.) While advantage should continue to be taken of suitable opportunities for thawing public attention generally to the qualifications of ex-regulars for civil employment, the solution of the problem lies in the full use of the Employ-mentally Exchange system, working under a scheme to be devised by the Service Departments and the Ministry of Labour, in collaboration with local commands and existing voluntary organisations.tii.i In the Government service it should be the accepted principle that, subject to the fulfilment of pledges to the various classes of men who served in the Great War in filling subordinate posts for which adult recruitment is the rule, consideration should first be given to duly quali-fied candidates who have served in the Regular Forces of the Crown, provided :(a.) That claims to promotion in ordinary course of persons already in the Civil Service shall be duly recognised.(b.) That where necessary, a limit be placed upon the number of persons employed in a Department who may at-any one time be subject to reserve liability.(iii.) In applying this principle Departments should utilise the joint machinery of the Ministry of Labour and voluntary organisations.(iv.) Local authorities should be apprised of arrangements for the selection of properly qualified ex-regular candidates for posts in the local administrations and in the Police Force.85. It appears to us desirable that, in order to facilitate the smooth working of these recommendations, a small standing eom-mittee should be charged with the responsibility of making such adjustments in points of detail as may from time to time be found necessary. It is probable that, at the outset, most of the points requiring arrangements will arise in connection with the recruitment to the Government service, and the utilisation of the Employment Exchange System, and we consider, therefore, that the Committee should include a representative of the Treasury and a representative of the Ministry of Labour, as well as one representative from each of the Service Departments. We contemplate, however, that this body should be at liberty to invite representatives from other Depart-ments to join their deliberations from time to time on particular aspects of the problem, so as to ensure that the principles we have laid down should be applied with due regard to administrative efficiency.N.
