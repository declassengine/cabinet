This document is the property of His Britannic majesty&apos;a Government211Printed for the Cabinet, April, 1928. SECRET. Copy No.CP. 180 (28)THE CABINET.INDIAN CONTRIBUTION FOR HOME EFFECTIVE charges of THE BRITISH ARMY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. I wish to bring before the Cabinet the question of the Indian contribution to      15 Home Effective Charges of the British Army.   The amount to be paid has been under    India discussion between the Government of India, the India Office and the War Office for    5924 some years, and no settlement has been reached.2. When I was in India, the Viceroy asked me to have an informal discussion of the matter with the Commander-in-Chief and his staff and with Sir Basil Blackett and Sir Bhupendra Mitra. We discussed the matter for some time, and the case of India was put both on political ami financial grounds.It was claimed (a) that no capitation grant at all should be charged for the British troops in India ; (b) that no such charge was made in other parts of the Empire, and (c) that it was an Imperial interest that the frontiers of India should be protected. It was said that some of the items in the War Office claim were exaggerated and others ought not to be included, and that if any sum were held to be payable, it should be less and not more than that now paid.I refuted all these claims but it became obvious that there was no prospect of a settlement.o. I gathered that it would be difficult for the Indian Government to agree to submit the question of the amount to arbitration, because if the arbitrator were not an Indian, it would be said that he was prejudiced in favour of the British Exchequer and the Assembly would be likely to refuse to vote the money.-i. I suggest that the Cabinet should first decide whether or not a capitation grant is to continue to be payable, and if their decision be in the affirmative, I suggest that they should appoint a Cabinet Committee to investigate and report on the amount which should be payable, so that the Cabinet can come to a decision binding on both India and the War Office.A brier statement of the recent history of the question is attached.L. W.-E.The War Office,2-ith April, 1928.APPENDIX.INDIAN CONTRIBUTION FOR HOME EFFECTIVE CHARGES OF THEBRITISH ARMY.1. The Contribution is designed to cover the cost of raising and training in the United Kingdom the officers and men to maintain the establishment of British Troops in India; it includes also other sundry &quot;home&quot; charges. It is paid in the form of an annual rate a head of the British (Regimental) numbers in India.2. The settlement of the rate is not a matter of accountancy or calculation only, but involves many complex and contentious questions of the relations between the Home and(B2S/17)   100  4/38   W.o.p.  :I5U3
Indian Governments on matters of responsibility for defence expenditure, Indian opinion being particularly critical of any expenditure outside India.3. The last general revision of the Contribution took place in 1907-8. In that your the claims and counter-claims advanced 03&apos; the War Office and India, after preliminary consideration by a Committee under Mr. Justice Homer, were compromised in the &quot; Haldane-Morley settlement&quot; by an addition of  .500,000 to lndia&apos;s annual payment (i.e., an increase from  56(5, 100 to  S66,400). Effect was given to this settlement by increasing the capitation rate from 67 10*. to  11 Ss. This settlement gave belated, and in the War Office view inadequate, recognition to the increased expenditure which the War Office had had for some years to meet in consequence of the increases in pay and in costs generally which had occurred during the 1(5 years since the capitation rate hud lust been reviewed. The War Office calculations, which wen; nor complete when the rlaldanc-Morlcy settlement was arrived at, would have warranted a far larger increase. The rate of payment then settled remained in force until the outbreak of the war, and was subsequently continued for the war period in accordance with the so-called &quot; Normal Cost&quot; agreement, under which India, apart from her specific war contributions offered subsequently, continued to expend during the war 011 military services such stuns and only such stuns as she would have spent if she had not sent troops to the theatres of war.(. After the war India&apos;s rate of payment was provisionally adjusted in the light of post-war conditions, with effect from 1st April, 1920. For the purpose of this adjustment the basis of the 1908 settlement was to remain unchanged, but the rate of payment was to he increased, to cover rises in prices and rates of pay, to about 2h times the pre-war level. This trave a total of i: 1,890.000 paid by India in 1920-21 ; this figure has been gradually reduced, owing to fall in prices and reduction of establishments in India, to  1,-100,000 in 1925-26, which India has been paying provisionally in each year since.No attempt was made in the 1020 adjustment to revise tin- capitation rate in respect of changes in rhe conditions of the post-war Army other than increased prices and rates of pay, although those changes also had involved a rise in training costs (see paragraph S below).It was definitely understood, however, that this was an interim arrangement, and that the complete review of the capitation rate would be undertaken as soon as circumstances permitted.5. The first step towards this revision was taken in 1924, when an Interdepartmental Conference was held at which the Government of India were represented by the late Lord llawlinson (then Commander-in-Chief, India) and Sir B. N. Mitra, now a member of the Viceroy&apos;s Council.(5. The War Office laid before this Conference in outline their estimate, amounting to upwards of .1*2,000,000, of the full cost to Army Funds o  the Home Effective Charges incurred on India&apos;s behalf. The general principles underlying this estimate were explored, and the Conference examined in some detail, without prejudice to those principles, draft statements prepared by the War Office supporting the main items of cost.7. The I ndiai) representatives on the Conference asked for complete statements, showing the estimated cost in full detail, to he furnished for examination in India. Work on the separate question of the Indian War Claims Settlement made progress with these soine-whar slow, but advance copies of many of the more important statements were forwarded to the India Office in 1024 and 1925, and completed statements (amounting to over 200 printed pages of calculations and explanatory matter such as India required) in June and October. 1020, and March, 1927.These statements showed a total charge, on the basis of prices and establishments in 102-1. of  2,298,000, equivalent to a capitation rate of  31! 19s. a year on the British regimental numbers in India.8. Meanwhile, in 1925, in view of the long time which the revision of the rate was likely to occupy, the War Office pointed out that the provisional adjustment of the Haldane-Morley rate made after the war (see paragraph 4 above) only covered some of the increases in the home charges which India was liable to repay, and that lndia&apos;s provisional payments were consequently inadequate even to meet, the Maldane-Morley arrangement when expressed in terms of post-war conditions. ,9, As sttited above (paragraph 3), that arrangement was a compromise at a rate substantially below the full cost as estimated by the War Office. The correct figure for 1925 on the llnldane-Morley basis, which the War Office estimated at  1,780,000, was thus substantially below tho total War Office claim of , 2,298,000 referred to in paragraph 7, but it appreciably exceeded the  1,400,000 which India was advancing. For l!)2(i the  1*730,000 would have fallen, mainly on account of the reductions in the pay of the Army introduced in October, Iif25, to  1,600,000.
10. The War Office felt that they had particularly strong ground for asking that, pending the full revision of the rate, which might involve extensive discussion and deliberation, they should at least receive advances based on the full terms of theHaldane-Morlcy compromise : without prejudice therefore to the ultimate payment for that year of a sum more nearly approximating to the  2,298,000, they asked for the advance for 11)26 to be made at the rate of  1,600,000 (instead of  1,100,000) and they inserted that figure in Estimates.11. The India Office have, however, refused to meet the War Oflice in this respect: they have adduced no arguments directly controverting the War Oflice interim claim, bur have referred back to the objections raised by India to the financial principles of the War Office claim in 1903, and have held out hopes, which India has not so far enabled them to realise, that the full revision will be dealt with at an early date. The Secretary of Suite for India has. it is true, given a definite assurance that when a settlement is reached it will date back id 1st April, 1926, but seeing that it is necessary in the meanwhile to find the money year by year to meet liabilities which are really IndiaV. this if somewhat eold comfort. Further, the necessity for finding money to meet arrears is likely to accentuate in a marked degree the local opposition in India to a settlement which gives any measure of recognition to the War Ofiiee claims.12. As stated above, the total Indian share of the training charges as shown in the detailed statements furnished to India amounted to a total of U2,2!)S,00Q. This figure was based on conditions obtaining in 15)24 ami is susceptible of various adjustments for changes in numbers, rates of pay ami prices ; for 1928-29 these would reduce the total to approximately  2.000,000.13. None of these totals includes anything at alj in respect of the pay of the Army Reserve ( 1,785,000 in 1928), although India obviously has a direct interest in it. The question whether India should not make some contribution towards this charge has long been one of controversy between the India Office and the War Office. In 1924. when the War Office first undertook the re-culculation of fndia&apos;s general contribution, they were prepared, as in the past, to omit this charge, without prejudice ; but it has recently been necessary to reconsider it in connection with a proposal that, in view of the reduced establishments of the British units iu India, some part of the Army Iteserve should be definitely earmarked to meet India&apos;s needs on mobilization.14. In order to secure some measure of finality, it has been agreed (in connexion with other claims) that the provisional payments made on the adjusted basis for the post-war years down to 31st March, 1926. are to stand as final.From 1st April, 1926, however, the War Office has been losing  200.000 a year as compared with the sum provided in Army Estimates, which, in turn, is, as stated above, far short of the extra cost which is being borne on India&apos;s behalf.15. The suggestion made by the Lord Chancellor at the meeting of 27th October, 19^7, that the Sea Transport Subsidy should be taken into account in the settlement of the capitation rate, is accepted by the War Office, who are prepared to negotiate with the Secretary of State for India on these lines.
