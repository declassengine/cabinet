This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues the attached memorandum regarding the position of land purchaso in Northern Ireland which is causing serious anxiety to the Government of Northern Ireland and myself.The Act of 1925 was an agreed 2aeasure for the oompulsory and automatic completion of land purchase passed with the general assent of the parties concerned.    Owing to the impossibility of dealing with all tlie outstanding holdings at the same time, power ?/as taken to fix different appointed days for different holdings, but the Act contemplated that within four years of its passing, except in the case of particular areas giving ris^ to special difficulties, all tenants coming within its scope would coase to pay rent and pay instead purchase annuities involving a reduction on an average of 17.5 per cent on thoir rent and become freeholders within 6S-g- yoars. It now appears that the number of holdings, as to which no precise information was available when the Act was passed, was very much under-estimated, and that in spite of every effort that has been and can be made to expedite the work, thei-s will have to be a carry over of about half the number of holdings which it will take a further period of three years to cover. The tenants concerned will, of course, in consequence not be getting as good terms as they v/ere led to expect when they accopted the Act, and strong representations have been made to ma, on behalf of these tenants, by their own associations, by the Government of Northern Ireland, and also by the Northern Ireland Ilembers of Parliament at Westminster.   These tenants have a legitimate grievanoe, and I am satisfied that the situation ought to be met by amending legislation if the partieSECRET.CABINET.CP. 146(28)LAND    PURCHASE    IK    NORTHERN    IRELAND.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.
can be get to agree on a reasonable scheme.   The interests of the landlords have of course also to be fully considered.Land purchase is one of the few live issues in Northern Ireland, and the position is causing the Government of Northern Ireland great embarrassment.    Indeed, fear is freely expressed that unloss something is done to remedy the grievance, the dissatisfaction of the tenants will make itself severely felt at the next election.    The subject of land purchase is reserved, and the responsibility for it rests with the Imperial Government and not with the Government of Northern Ireland, but the Government of Northern Ireland will cortainly bo accused, and are indeed being accused now, of being, in fact though not in theory, responsible, or. the ground that if thoy came forward with an offer to provide the necessary funds the Imperial Government could have no objection to an amendment of the Act.    The Government of Northern Ireland are prepared to provide such funds as may be necessary up to a limit of  50,000 or  60,000.    This will be sufficient to finance a scheme under which tho claims of the tenants can be met without making any change in the position of the landlords who would continue to receive their full rents up to the time when the purchase money is allocated.    The Government of Northern Ireland have agreed that the cost of the scheme shall not fall either directly or indirectly on the British taxpayer.I should be glad to have authority to invite the Government of Northern Ireland to open up negotiations with representatives cf the landlords and tenants on the basis of the scheme outlined in the memorandum.    It v/ould be an advantage that the negotiations should take place in the first instance locally, but they may have to be continued over hare.    The matter is one of urgency, but if, as I hope an agreement can be reached upon the linos indicated the necessary legislation (which will then be non-controversial) need not bo introduced until next Session.
MEMORANDUM   ON    LAND   PURCHASE    IN   NORTHERN    ireland.    The purpose of the Northern Ireland Land Act, 1925, was to provide for the automatic and compulsory completion of land purchase in Northern Ireland on the basis of the report of the Percy Committee  issued in 1923) which adapted the principles of land purchase accepted by the Irish Convention of 1910 to the circumstances of the moment.   It was an agreed measure concurred in by the Government of Northern Ireland and having the general assent of the landlords and tenants in Northern Ireland,   &quot;without such assent the Government would not have been prepared to introduce the measure.   The Committee recommended that compulsory purchase should be brought into operation at the earliest possible moment - as soon as the Land Purchase Commission could make the necessary arrangements.    For administrative reasons it was impossible to arrange for the automatic transfer of all lands on the same day, it being necessary to survey the land and to decide which holdings came within the scope of the Act, a process which can only be carried out by degrees.    The Act (sec. 35) enabled different days to be appointed for different areas and for different holdings or groups of holdings not being more than 4 years after the passing of the Act, with a proviso that,  if the necessity for such a course could be shown dates more than 4 years after the passing of the Act might be fixed for particular areas.2.   There was at that time no precise information available as to the number of holdings to be dealt with;    this wa3 variously estimated at 23,000 as a minimum and 29,000 as a maximum, and it was thought that on this basis the work of vesting the holdings in the commission could be substantially completed within four years,   V/hen, however, the actual particulars were obtained it was found that the number exceeds 30,000.   The fact that the actual number of holdings has proved so much greater
than had been anticipated and certain administrative difficult! which have been experienced in the discharge of the work entailed made it impossible for the Commission to carry out the original programme &quot;within the period prescribed. 3.    In consequence at the end of four years from the passing of the Act, i.e. on 28th Hay, 1929, there will he about 19,000 holdings outstanding.   This means that half the tenants in northern Ireland who had not become owners under the operation of previous Acts when the 1925 Act was passed will be kept waiting for a further period, and will in the meantime have to continue to pay rents to their landlords instead of purchase annuities representing on an average a reduction of 17.5 per cent on the rents.    The work of the Commission is being speeded up as much as possible by taking on additional staff and improving the procedure, but it is estimated that it will take a further three years from Hay, 1929, before all these tenants receive the benefit of the Act.4.    This position is naturally causing acute dissatisfaction among the &quot;unbought&quot; tenants, more particularly as tenants in the Free State obtained an immediate reduction of rents in 1923 and has forced upon the Home Office the necessity of consider in what can be done to compensate them for a delay v/hich they had no reason to anticipate and for which thejr are in no way responsible.    Both the tenants and the landlords concerned can legitimately claim that they should not be in a worse position than they would have been if the programme had been adhered to, and an effort must be made to arrive at an agreed scheme which will secure in effect the terms on which they agreed to accept the Act of 1925.5.    The 1925 Act provides that on .the gale day (the date when rent accrues) last preceding the day appointed for the vesting of a holding in the Land Furchase Commission a tenant ceases to pay rent to the landlord and pays instead to the Land Purchase
Conmission an annuity at the rate of 4^ per cent, on the value of the holding ascertained in accordance with a Schedule based on the existing judicial rents.   This a3- per cent includes 4-V per cent interest on the purchase money and   per cent towards a sinking fund to enable the purchase money to be redeemed in 66h years and the tenant to become a freeholder. The Land Purchase Fund in the books of the national Debt Commissioners receives credit for the annuities collected by the Government of northern Ireland and the national Debt Commissioners issue biennially bonds to the credit of the Land Purchase Commission of a sufficient amount to cover the purchase money required from time to tine.   As soon as possible after the day appointed for the vesting of the holding in the Commission the title of the landlord and the claims of encumbrancers are examined and determined, and the purchase money is allocated.    All encumbrances are discharged by the Land Purchase Commission in cash realised by the sale of bonds, and the balance of the purchase money is paid in bonds to the landlord.   Pending the allocation of the purchase money the landlord receives interest at the rate of 4--V per cent on the purchase money.    The sinking fund payments are retained by the national Debt Commissioners.    These transactions involve no charge on public funds.6.   Under the previous Acts land purchase was voluntary, and to induce the landlord to sell he was given under the 1903 Act, a bonus from public funds payable on the completion of the purchase.   The 1925 Act (Section 10) provides for a bonus equivalent to about 11 per cent of the purchase money, and if payment of the bonus is delayed for more than a year from the gale day next preceding the day appointed for vesting the holding in the Commission interest is thereafter payable thereon at the rate of 4%- per oent.
7.   After consultation v/ith the Government of Northern Ireland the following scheme is put forward as a basis of negotiation with the representatives of the landlords and tenants :-.To put every tenant in the same position as ha would have occupied if his holding had been vested In the Commission by the 20th Hay, 1929, it will be necessary, as and when the holding, having been found to fall within the scope of the Act, is vested in the Commission, to allow him a rebate equivalent to the difference between the purchase annuity and the rent paid by him in the meantime.   The sum required for this purpose is estimated at  34,000.    It will also be necessary to provide for payments into the sinking fund to enable all the annuities to run from the 20th Hay, 1929. The sum required for this purpose is estimated at  0,500. 0.   The question of recovering part at any rate of the cost of the scheme from the landlords who will be receiving thej.r full rents for a longer period than they had any reason to anticipate has been carefully considered, but it is felt that any such proposal would meet with great opposition.   The landlords would be sure to urge that there has been a corresponding delay in the allocation of the purchase money so that those who have to meet heavy charges are worse off than they would have been if there had been no such delay, and that even in cases where the delay has been an advantage they ought not, without compensation, to be deprived of this advantage which has accrued to then under an agreed measure.    It is, therefore, proposed that no part of the cost shall fall upon the landlords, whether by deduction from the purchase money or otherwise, and they will receive the purchase money and the bonus in accordance with the terms of the 1925 Act.    The landlords nay further represent that as something is being done for the tenants, something should also be done for them.    In this connection it may be observed that a simplified procedure is under consideration
which would enable the purchase money to be allocated much more expeditiously.   This will be a substantial advantage to the. landlords in addition to facilitating administration.The Government of Northern Ireland are willing to bear the whole of the cost of the scheme in such a way that it will fall neither directly nor indirectly on the British taxpayer, and the sum of  50,000 or  00,000, which they are prepared to provide should be ample for the purpose.
