Pins, Hooks and Eyes and Snap Fasteners.Memorandum by the President of the board of Trade.I circulate to my colleagues the report of the Committee which was set up under the Safeguarding Procedure to consider an application for the imposition of an import duty on buttons, pins, hooks and eyes, snap fasteners and :ara. 41. similar fasteners.     The Committee recommend the Impositionof a duty of 337^ ad valorem upon &quot;buttons of all materials (both finished and unfinished) of a description commonly used for the fastening or decoration of apparel, except ara. 68. when already in use on articles of apparel on Importation&quot;.They find against the applicants on all the other articles covered by the enquiry.In accordance with the undertaking I have given on several occasions that small industries v/ould be &quot;allowed to make joint applications where they were so clearly and closely related that they could reasonably be regarded as a unit, I referred this joint application for enquiry as prjma facie fulfilling these conditions.     The Committee, ara. 43. however, reached the conclusion that two separate groupswere involved which must be considered upon their Individual merits.
f 2d&apos; i l-j - h oThe first section of the report deals with buttons. The Committee find in favour of the applicants on all thera. 23. heads of the nlrite Paper.     The substantial importance ofthe industry on the ground of the volume of employment wasras. 24-25.     not disputed.     The great variety of types of buttons and changes in classification in the trade returns render it difficult to make an accurate statistical comparison of the course of imports and home production, but the Committee were satisfied, after taking into account the general evidence given at the Inquiry, that since 1913 and markedly since 1924 there has been a considerable rise in the ratio of retained imports to home production.;ra. 27. The imported articles are sold at prices with whichthe home manufacturers cannot compete and which are even sometimes below the bare manufacturing cost in this country.;ras. 31-32.     The Committee are of opinion from the evidence of actualloss of employment and of short time in the factories that employment is being seriously affected in the manufacture of all types of buttons except erinoid and that there it is likely to be seriously affected.     The competition, whicharas.33-37.       comes mainly from Germany, Gzecho-Slovakia, Austria, Italy, Japan and France, is found to be unfair by reason of the&apos;.ras.38-39.       lower wages in those countries. The efficiency of theindustry was not seriously challenged and the Committee do not find that a duty on buttons would effect employment in any using industry.As regards the group of articles consisting of pins, hooks and eyes and snap fasteners, the Committee find, in Section II of the report, that no cose for a dutyara, 56. has been made out, mainly on the ground that Imports havenot in any of these classes of goods been shown to be abnormal, any reduction in home output and employment
-i or,Ju Ij Ora.63. in this trade being due mainly to causes other than foreigncompetition, such as fashion and improved machinery.   they-a.57. also doubt whether this industry taken alone can beconsidered of substantial importance.I think the Comittee are right in their conclusions in both sections of the report and I racormend that the Cabinet should approve the inclusion of a duty on buttons in this year&apos;s Finance Bill and that no duty should be proposed in respect of the other articles dealt with in the inquiry.     The duty should cone into force as soon as possible after the Budget statement.    I also propose to publish the report of the Committee in accordance with an established practice just before the introduction of the Budget.P.C-L.Board of Trade,loth April, 1923.
To The Right Hon.Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E., M.G., M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,By Minute of the Board of Trade dated the 3rd October, 19C7, we were appointed a Committee &quot;to enquire into and report upon an application, which has been made, under the Safeguarding of Industries Procedure, by the British Button Manufacturers1 Association and the Pin, Hook and Eye and Snap Fastener Employers&apos; Association for the imposition of an import duty on buttons of all materials both finished and unfinished, and on pins, hooks and eyes, snap fasteners, glove domes, grips and similar fasteners&quot;.The Applicants were represented by Counsel: Mr. 3. Faraday (instructed by Messrs. Burchell Wilde and Company) appearing on their behalf.     The application was -opposed separately by two bodies:   by a group of importers and wholesalers who were represented by Counsel Mr. N.L. Macaskie and Mr.-J.3.Herbert,  (instructed by Messrs. Stikeman and Company) appearing on their behalf j   and by the rJholesale Textile Association who gave evidence in regard to Buttons but were not represented by Counsel. Any reference in this report to the Opposition must be read as indicating the former body.Tie have held 55 meetings in all, 31 of which were devoted to the hearing of evidence.   Having been asked to deal v/ith a number of different articles which vary considerably in manufacture and conditions, we felt it convenient to divide the hearing of evidence, into two sections, one dealing with buttons and tho other dealing with the remaining articles covered by the application,
and we have dealt separately in our report .a. th each of these sections.   In the first section we held IS public meetings and heard 21 witnesses on behalf of the applicants, 2 on behalf of the Wholesale Textile Association and 3 on behalf of the Opposition.&apos;.e ourselves made enquiries of the Board of Trade during the course of the hearing on various points connect sd with the Census of Production Report 1924, and various explanatory particulars and additional figures r-ore supplied to us.SiJCTICS I.   BUi-rOIIo. - . The but ben Industry is a particularly complexone.    The varieties produced and sold in this country are many:    the materials from which they are made cover a wide field:    and the conditions affecting their manufacture and use differ considerably.It is material vo notice that fashion plays an important part among the conditions affecting the button trade, especially in the case of ladies&apos; garments, the demand being to a great extent capricious and short lived* thus in 1924-5 dresses would be ormamented v;ith rows of fancy buttons, and in later years a single large button would be in vogue.     Buttons of one description or material are, moreover, continually being replaced by those of another.     But apart from this ve are oatisfaid from a comparison of the figures of home output and imports and from the general evidence at the inquiry that there has been a reduction in the actual total consumption of battons
The main classes with which our enquiry has been principally concerned are1.    Fancy buttons2.    Trouser (and Vest and Coat) buttons3.    Pearl buttons and4.   Linen buttons. Fancy buttons at the present time are mainly Erinoid Calalith or sane other casein product which lends itself to an infinity of designs and a wide range of artistic colouring.    They seem largely to have taken the place of the celluloid and vegetable ivory buttons which were formerly used in considerable quantities on ladies1 garments.Trouper buttons were until recent years mainly of metal but ao  fat1 ai regards the medium and better class trade they are no., largely made of Corozo or vegetable ivory and even in the cheap trade the place of the ordinary metal button has we are informed been taken to a great extent by a metal imitation of the ivory button.    The ^orozo button is also almost ur.iversally used now on coats and v.aistcoat3 in lieu of the old bone button.Pearl buttons of the better class are made from the different kinds of pearl shell, but the great bulk of the trade i s in the cheaper lines which are cut from a univalve shell known in the trade as &quot;irochus&quot; and from a number of other bivalves mostly of fresh water origin.    Ihis trade has largely increased since the introduction of the cheaper button.Linen buttons which consist of a metal frame covered with fabric are used mainly on underwear and on moat garments which are washed at home. are told that in the case ofwomen&apos;s underwear change of fashion and the a\bstitution of
10 Velastic has caused a diminution in the demand for linen buttons,   but it is clear that they ore still used in enormous quantities, and we have had evidence of large orders in this class both from nome and foreign manufattur er s.S. &apos;   . In addition of these, there is a long category of other buttons of less important varieties, made of the same materials and also of celluloid, glass, porcelain, xylonite, home, tortoise-shell, jet, leather, wood, fancy metals, and compositions of different kinds.     It is, however, impossible in this report cc deal rcitn more than the four principal clashes above referred to,  ind ue consider that they may be taken as typical of the whole industry.rinoid      e.   . The erinoid button trade is post-war in thiscountry and has rapidly gro*vn in popularity for ladies1 v?ear.    There is no doubt, hov.ever, that it has displaced other kinds of buttons such as celluloid, fancy metal and vegetable ivory, and although the majority of the manufacturers are ne.v firm.; r.ho have started since the war, it must,  .ve think, be considered as forming an integral part of a pre-war trade, viz. the general clas^ of fancy buttons.    Ti.e home output and employment in this erinoid manufacture hao increased with the expanding trade but there appears to be little doubt that latterly the foreign buttons have been rapidly ousting the British product in the cheaper qualities, leaving to the home manufacturer only the more expensive.    There is no question as to the Korkmanahlp of the British erinoid button, and in the highest classes of fancy goods the British manufacturers are fairly able to hold their own.     But in tho cheaper claasoj the foreign erinoid button seem.s to command - or is
rapidly getting command of the market in this country and It seems reasonably clear that it Is only in exceptional cases that orders can be secured by the home manufacturers. 10. There are two rival methods of manufacture inerinoid, via. pressing and turning.      Eoth methods have been tried in this country, but    as the operation of a press entails more labour - the turning lathes being practically automatic - the British manufacturers have been forced to give up the use of presses, and at the present time their output is almost entirely confined to turned buttons.     The foreigner,  on the other hand,  ;vith the advantage, as it appears to us, of cheaper labour, produces a large quantity of pressed buttons In which undoubtedly a greater range of designs is possible for the cheaper lines.     These are imported in increasing quantitie and are steadily ousting the cheaper varieties of the British turned button.      Wo heard something of a newly invented multiple press which was said to reduce labour costs in this process, and we were told that foreign firms are able in some cases to make use of their erinoid waste in further production, which is not done here.      These processes, however, seem to be still in an experimental stage on the Continent and have not so far been adopted in this country.     Thero were also complaints from the Opposition as to the limited range of both colours and designs among home manufacturers.      As to colours we think that there is no grtund for the complaint, and the question of design turns mainly on the rival processes of pressing and turning.11. In regard to Coroao little need be said.      Theimports from Italy which are verj large have retained their pre-war level in post-war years while home production has
decreased by more than 75 per cent, and it is clear that the Eritish manufacturers are quite unable to compete with the Italian prices.     There are only two firms now vsho attempt the manufacture in this country and even these are obliged to factor foreign buttons in one form or another to supply their cheapest market.      He are satisfied that the principal reason for the cheapness of the Italian buttons Is the lower cost of labour in that country,  lower overhead? and mass production. &quot;(7e may add that it was franklyadmitted by the Wholesale Textile Association that this was a fair case for a safeguarding duty, although this was denied by the other Opponents.Trouser buttons of the cheaper type are generally made of metal a^d here again we were shown samples of foreign imports at prices very much below the British cost.      Although in the case of the button which is mainly sold, viz.,  imitation ivory or &apos;&apos;shell 4-hole&apos;&quot;, we were informed that the British cost could be very materially reduced by the installation of special machines which are in use on the Continent, we do not think that even this change would, under present circumstances, enable the British manufacturer to produce the same button at a competitive price.The question of the pearl button industry In this country is one of considerable difficulty.      The home manufacture is,  at the present time,  almost exclusively a mother of pearl industry, whereas the imported goods which far exceed the home production in qtiantity consist almost entirely of buttons made from the trochus shell and from cheap fre^h water shells obtained locally in Japan. These but-tons are hardly distinguishable in appearance to the ordinary buyer from the real mother of pearl, but they are sold at
much lower prices and for this reason are undoubtedly attractive and have practically ousted the small mother of pearl buttons in the home market,   &quot;e do not think that we should be justified under our terms of reference in recommending a protective duty merely because a new type of article of foreign tuanufacture had supplanted a more expensive home product, and this we understund to be the argument of the opponents.    But this is hardly the case v;hicn we have to consider.     The trochus shell was introduced into and used in the manufacture of buttons in this country for some years before the war, although not on a very extensive scale, and we are informed that by 1S13, British manufacturers v/ere rapidly getting into a position to compete r.ith the Japanese importers.    Since the war, however, the home production of these buttons,   Instead of increasing, has steadily decreased and is now reduced to a very small total.     It i3 clear, on the other hand, that the Japanese buttons are being imported In enormous and Increasing quantities^- especially in the smaller sizes which form the staple tracii and in which the percentage of labour costs is highest.     There is no reason to believe that the cost of the brochus snell (which ccmes from Australian water3) is materially cheaper to tho Japanese, when freights both ways are taken into account, though no doubt they are in an advantageous position in respect of the fresh water shells, but the British manufacturers cannot get do.oa to anything like imported prices, and in the absence of any other explanation we arc driven to the conclusion that the*The Japanese shell buttons are apparently   included In the Import Returns both under the heading &quot;Mother of pearl (none of which in the strict sonje comes, we understand, from Ja;.ian) and under &quot;Other Descriptions&quot;.    Tire total importation from Japan under these heads was a little over 2  million gross in IS20 and in 1927 it had risen to over 4 &apos;-- million gross.
1cheap production of Japan must be ascribed in the main colower labour conditions in that country.There are now only two firms left in thiscountry who do this trade to any important extent, butthey are, in our opinion, sufficiently equipped to take their full share in this important aection of the buttonindustry if conditions can be equalized, though we feel some doubt whether the 33-*-/^ per cent, duty asked for by the applicants will be practically effective.15.British manufacturers also meet with directoompetiwion from tr.e continent and especially from Austria In real mother of pearl and since 1924, the first year for which re have separate figures, this competition has increased.    The prices in the smaller sizes of the imported but torn., are again considerably lower than those at which our own products can be    sold, though in the larger sizes, in which the proportion of labour is less, the home manufacturers are again fairly able to hold their own. These lines do not, however, represent the bulk of the trade.    It was  suggested to us that the quality of the British article is much superior to the foreign but the differences appear to be more in the quality of the labour employed on finishing than In factors affecting the price and we arc here again driven to the conclusion that the lor rates of wages abroad afford the only explanation for the dif f er eiic es in price. 16.   &quot;   - Linen buttons which are the largest class of alland in quantity represent even to-day more than 50 oer cent, of the total Brlti&amp;i production stand on rather a different footing from tho others.    There is no doubt, and indeed it is admitted by the Applicants, that there has been betv.eer. 1913 and the present time an appreciable falling off in the
total consumption of linen buttons, owing no doubt to an actual reduction in use and to the substitution of cheap shell buttons for linen.   The decline, in production, however, which between 1913 and 1926 amounted to as much as 50 per cent., lias been continuous 3ince the war and it was contended by applicant witnesses that the effect of the change of fashion had already been felt in full before 1921 and that the fail in British output since that date i3 entirely due to foreign competition.   Witnesses called by the Wholesale Textile Association and support ed by the Opposition maintained, on the other hand, that fashion and not importation is accountable for the whole of the falling off in post-war years. 17. . Imnort-s of linen buttons are not separatelydistinguished in the trade accounts but they should, if correctly declared be included under &quot;metal buttons and studs, covered or not, other than push buttons and studs&quot; and comparing the imports under this heading with the producbion of linen buttons of which we have had evidence we find that the ratio has risen from an average of 0.5 per cent, in the three years 1920-1922 to 31 per cent, in 1925, 28,5 per cent, in 1926, and 40 per cent, in the first  S months of 1927.     We recognise that bhis heading should also include metal trouser buttons, which is a reduced trade, and a small number of other metal buttons such as blazer, anchor and fancy metal buttons,  but, on the other hand, a certain quantity of ordinary linen buttons may, and pillow-case buttons (which have no metal centre) certainly 3hould, also come in under the general heading &quot;other descriptions&quot;. Complaint of foreign competition is only made in regard to the lov/ end of the trade uhich comprises we are told about
65 per cent, of the production and indeed it was clear frofc the evidence that the home market for the better olaBB of linen buttons Is supplied almost exclusively from production in this country.       The Applicants also oomtended, we think with some moasure of truth, that change of fashion has for the moat part affected the high end of the traae.   The ratio of imports to production may, therefore, be considerably heavier in the low end than appears from the total figures, though on any interpretation of the import figures thoy cannot account for tho whole of the falling off in home production even in post-war years   * and the balance must, we think, be attributed to change of fashion.     On the whole the conclusion to which we have come is that though&quot; in this class of button generally the effect of foreign competition is not so marked there is a gradual and increasing ouster by the foreign product of the cheaper classes of buttons produced in this country.The outstanding fact in connection with each of theso large classes or buttons is that the foreign competition comes mainly at what is called the &quot;low end&quot; of the trade, i.e. in the cheapest qualities.    Hero labour is necessarily the most important item in the cost, and it Bsei^e to be the inevitable conclusion that the principal reason is cheaper labour abroad.     There seems to be very little difference in tho cost of - the particular material in each&apos;oaao to the foreigner and to the British manufacturers, and except in the case of the erinoid pressing processes referred to in paragraph 10 above and the Continental production of imitation ivory trouBer buttons referred to in paragraph 12 above, there has been no suggestion that the foreign machinery is more efficient.      It is possible that power is definitely cheaper in other countries, but we
have had no evidence of this and it cannot, we think, be a large item in the difference in cost of production.     Wo are satisfiea, therefore, as already stated, that the only possible explanation of the cheapness of the imported article is lower labour costs and it may be to some extent proteotod home markets in the producing countries.But though, as indicated in the previous paragraph,  the British manufacturer is left in all the classos referred to in a comparatively favourable position as regards tho trade in tho higher grades of buttons, his steady ouster from the cheap qualities reacts seriously upon his manufacturing position.     For in the first place it is only the cheap buttons whicli are required in large quantities, and if they are eliminated from the home manufacturers programme, anything in the nature of mass production is practically impossible, with the result that overhead costs tend to increase unduly.     Moreover, comparatively small orders for a number of different varieties are necessarily un-economical.    In the second place in the case of larger buttons where the British manufacturer can to a considerable extent hold his own owing to the greater  proportion of material to labour, there is - at least In the case of such materials as the pearl shell, and to some degree also in the case of oorozo and erinoid - a greater waste of material, where no small buttons are ordered.   The surplus material after cutting out the few large &quot;blanks&quot; or disc9 from the best part of even a large pearl shell Is considerable, and if no use oan be found for it, the cost of the whole shell has to be charged to the few buttons produced from it.    It is obvious that the foreigner making the smallest sizes and so having less waste, is at a great advantage and for this reason too
we conoider the manufacture of the small buttons is a necessity to the trade if it is to be maintained in reasonable prosperity.    It is also, of course, clear that any serious falling off in the production of the cheaper qualities means reduction in employment.Apart from questions of change of fashion, with an increasing population it is only reasonable to expect an increase of demand for such an every-day necessity as many of the ordinary types of button must be, and the tendency, therefore,  should be definitely towards an increase of employment.    fhe reverse, however, appears to have been the case in recent years, and we have heard from witness after witness of idle machines and a decreasing labour roil.    It is, we think,  instructive in this connection -tion to notice how manufacturing firms in this country have had to divert their energies to ne?; outlets.    Thus we find one manufacturer combining :-;-ith his original business that of a factor of imported buttons.   Another imports plain corozo buttons from Italy and dyes them for the home market;    a third imports &quot;blanks&quot; and turns them into the finished article: a fourth utilizes his button making machines for making parts of studs, and so on.    V/e have also had many instances of sales below cost in the often desperate hope of retaining a vanishing trade.As proposed in paragraph 8 above, we have dealt in some detail with the different types of buttons to which the evidence in this inquiry has been mainly directed,  but we do not suggest that they either can or should be dealt with separately.    They are to a great extent interchangeable and form a homogeneous class, and we think that any duty which may ultimately be held desirable should be applied to all types of buttons alike.    Any attempt at
discrimination between different categories would, in our opinion, be ineffective and would probably lead to many complications.Havin^ stated our conclusions generally, we now proceed to record our answers to the questions formulated by the white taper.(i) !&apos;?/h ether the suplicant Industry is,  by reason of the volume of employment engaged in the production of the goods to which the application relates or by reason of the nature of the ^oods produced, an industry of substantial importance.&quot;It was not disputed by the Opposition that the button industry, taken by itself, i3, by reason of the volume of employment, of substantial importance.    The number of persons employed in 1913 is estimated to have been 5,844 and in 1926 3,629.    -&quot;e have no difficulty, therefore,  in answering this question in the affirmative.(2) &quot;Tnether foreign goods of the class or description to which the application relates are beiner imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.confer the purpose of comparison with the figures of retained imports the Applicants furnished us with actual figures of the output of eleven representative firms which they estimated to account for 80 per cent,  of  cha total production in this country.      We have tabulated these figures below, setting beside them the 100 per cent, output calculated on this basis,  but we feel some doubts as to whether the 80 per cent, estimate o-&apos; the Applicants is altogether reliable.      It is no doubt extremely difficult to arrive at any conclusive figure for the purposes of comparison either in quantity or value owing to the wide
and rapidly changing; variety or the buttons produced and to the very large differences in their relative values which runI Ifrom pence to shillings per gross.    Linen buttons for example probably account for nearly three quarters of the total quantity of buttons made in this country,  but for considerably less than half their value and even in   -individual classes the variations are quite considerable.    The figures of the 11Ifirms moreover do not include most of the erinoid which, according to the evidence given before us, has been a growing trade.    V.&apos;e were asked to deal with erinoid separately as a post-war industry but we think it obvious that it has replaced other types of buttons and that the whole industry must be taken together and the comparison made, mainly at all events, with 1913.    The difficulty of accurate comparison is also increased by the fact that metal buttons were not distinguished in the imuort returns before the war.Despite however all the difficulties of comparison which have been pointed out to us we are satisfied on theievidence, and this was really all that the Applicants finally contended,  that there ha3 been since 1913 and markedly since 1924 a considerable rise in the rutio of retained imports to home production.    It seems clear that home production has fallen off since.the war - no doubt in part owing to changes of fashion - and that in the case of most producing firms a reduction of profits and in some cases actual losses have been experienced in recent years, while on the other hand imports have been able to maintain and even increase their hold on the market since the war.    The very considerable increase in imports for l9i;7 may be accounted for to some extent by an intelligent anticipation of this enquiry,  but the net result is that the imports have nov; as far as can be
estimated regained the pre-war level while the home production remains a long way below it.    Our general conclusion, therefore, bearing in mind the considerations noted in respect of particular types of buttons in the earlier paragraphs of our Report, is that buttons are being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.PRODUCTION OF 11 FIRLiS.I TOTAL OUTiUT Oli BASIS !

They also include studs but we have no evidence as to the quantities ofthese which are imported.(3) &quot;Whether the foreign goods so imported are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.&quot; 27. On the question of prices we have had a considerablevolume of evidence, much of which is wo think reliable.    In the great number of cases the selling price of the foreign article is below the bare cost of production in this country.
HWe have had careful and elaborate costings from many of tho British firms, and except in one case where the overhead charges appeared to be unduly high, it has not been suggested that they are either inaccurate or extravagant though at the same time it is true that in many caaes the British product is a better quality article which may not unreasonably be supposed to be slightly more expensive to make.    7?e have had on the other hand invoices and quotations from foreign manufacturers which, though possibly in exceptional cases for derelict stock, and therefore not affording a fair comparison, make it quite clear that with the exception of specially high class buttons the imported articles in all the principal classes are sold at prices with whicii the home manufacturers cannot possibly compete.    vVe have had the less hesitation in accepting theso selling prices as generally prevalent inasmuch as the Opposition, which represents a lar&amp;e number of merchants, has not brought before us any evidence which would lead us to an opposite conclusion.    Indeed, they contended in some cases that the prices were so much lower that no reasonable scale of duty would be sufficient to bridee the gap. 28. The lower price of the imported articles is most markedin the case of the Japanese trochus buttons for which without more definite evidence than v.e have been able to obtain as to the conditions of manufacture in Japan, rce find it very difficult to account.    The same may be said though in a less degree of the Italian corozo buttons which are made in enormous quantities in a number of factories in the neighbour-hood of Milan.    V/e answer this question in the affirmative.(i-) &quot;V-hethar,  by reason of the severity and extent of such competition,  emyloyment in the manufacture or production of such goods in the United Kingdom is bein^;.  or is likely to-IS -
be, seriously affected,&quot;29.        The Applicants made a munber of estimates of totalemployment in the industry upon different bases and concluded that total employment fell from 6,844 in 1913 to 3,629 In 1926.    Their figure for 1926 seems to agree substantially with the figure of persons employed in 1924 by all firms mainly engaged in the manufacture cf buttons which was supplied to us from the Census of Production Office,30. Taken alone these totals point to a very large drop inemployment in the industry but we have remarked before thatthe actual total consumption of buttons has probably beenreduced in this period.   Vie therefore thought it right, as weare concerned under this section only with a falling off inemployment which apps&amp;rs to be due to foreign competition, toexamine the course of employment since the war in the elevenfirms for which returns were supplied and ??hich represent themain bulk of the industry other than erinoid.     It will be observed from the figures of these firms which are given below that employment dropped by 50/J in the sluiirp year 1921 andhas since remained at or about the level then reached.Employment of the eleven firms.1913 ................ 3,5301920................ 2,8481921 ................ 1,9761922 ................ 2,2411925 ................ 1,9351924 ................ 1;8241925 ................ 2,0321926 ................ 1,95531. Apart from these, on the whole, steady figures of reduced employment we heard on every hand of short time beingworked in factories in order to avoid the dismissal of staff.Having regard to the reduction in hours worked and to theactual reduction in employment which can we think be due inpart only to fashion, we are of opinior- that employment inthe manufacture of buttons other than erinoid is being
seriously affected by the competition complained of. 52.        So far as erinoid i3 concerned we havo had regard to the figures of firns which gave evidence before us.     Vie do not think that employment in this section of manufacture hag been as yet soriously effected but tho position disclosed in regard to it in the course of tho enquiry and described -in paragraphs 9 and 10 of our introduction is, wo think, such that employment is likely to be seriously affected in the near future unless a duty is imposed.(5) &quot;Whether such exceptional competition comes largely from countries where the, conditions are so different from those in this country as to render the competition unfair*&quot;Competition for the purpose of such enquiry is not tobe deemed to be unfair unions it arises from one or more ofthe following causes:-&quot; (a) Depreciation of currency operating so as to creats^ an expert bounty.,il (b) Subsidies, bounties,, cr other artificial advantages a&apos;1 (c) Inferior conditions of emplcyment of labour., whether as re gpects reriuneratIon or hours of empjoyment, or otherwise, &quot;oc&quot;ia:ird.r:g amongst the persons employed in tho production of the Imported goods in question as compared&quot; with tnosc obtaining amongst persons employed in t lie pro auction of similar goods in the United Kingdom&quot;!&quot;&quot;33. The competition of which the applicants complain conesfrom different countries;    in the case cf metal and linen buttons it is aiainly from Germany and Czechoslovakia;    in the case of corozo almost entirely from Italy;    in erinoid mainly from Germany and to some extent from Holland, Czechoslovakia and Austria;    in Mo the r-cf-Pearl from Austria and Czechoslovakia and In trochus and fresh-water shell from Japan and, to some extent, f rom Prance.34. we have had no evidence of depreciation of currency, orsubsidies, bounties or other artificial advantages abroad.
35c The general conclusion that foreign wages are lower than in this country was not disputed hy the Opposition, although they pointed out that wages in &quot;foroign countries have boon rising and are not so low as was suggested In some casos by the Applicants.36.        In this country wages are regulated by a trade board, under which the minimum rates for- workers over 21 years are l/3d. to l/l-^d, per hour (men) and 7-lu. to 6-ljd. per hour (women).     We gathered that a good deal of labour in some button factories is juvenile laboxir for which, of course, the trade board rates arc lower, but we have no reason to suppose that this is not also the case abroad.37.        We had information from various sources dealingwith wages in the button industry in Italy, Japan, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Germany.     In every case wages were considerably below those in this country, and although this information was not always quite up-to-date and It is probably true that wages abroad have been lately on the upgrade, we are satisfied that on the whole wages are so different in the foreign countries mainly engaged In the manufacture of these articles as to render the competition unfair within the meaning of the  hite Paper.&quot;(6) Whether the Applicant industry is being carried on in the United Kingdom with reasonable efflciency and economy0&apos;38. The efficiency of no section of this industry was seriously challenged.     The factories engaged appear to be very efficient and progressive in their methods and the machinery used is in almost every instance of the most up-to-date type and is evon, we are told, In some cases superior to the foreign machinery.     It is satisfactory to record that in the great majority of cases where competition is acute the superiority of the home trado is generally
acknowledged.     Indeed, the only protest made is that British workmanship is too good for the low end of the trade from which, in most cases, the great bulk of the demand come3.     &apos;7e have had no complaints from the -Opposition of difficulty Xn getting orders executed or of dilatoriness In ftilfllment of contracts.&quot;(7) Whether the in position of a duty on goods of the class or description in question would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment in any other industry being an industry using goods of that class or description in production.&quot;39.        Our answer to this question  is in the negative.It may be admitted that a duty upon imported buttons would affect to some extent all makers of clothing, but the expenditure on these articles is necessarily such a small item in the cost of any individual garment that vq cb not think a duty would have any adverse effect upon employment in the clothing trade.40. It has been suggested to us that there is a largere-export trade which now has its home in this country and that the facilities for re-export would be greatly decreased if a duty was imposed. &quot;Vhile recognizing the importance of this re-export trade, we doubt whether our conclusions ought to be influenced by this consideration and we think that the suggested difficulties could be got over by separate orders for and separate packing of buttons.&quot; (Q) Whether, having regard to the above conditions., the applicant industry has, in the opinion of the Committee, established a olaimi to a duty;    and, if so, what rate or rates of duty, in the opinion of the Committee, would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition.&quot;41. The duty asked for was S^/ofj on all buttons.     We
have some doubt whether in every case this amount will be sufficient to bridge the gap in prices, and there are probably some types of buttons such as those made from the cheap Japanese fresh water shell with which we shall never be able to compete in this country, but any higher duty would probably be excessive in other classes, and we do not think that it would be feasible to impose discriminating rates on the different classes.      On the whole we have come to the conclusion that when differences of quality have been allowed for, a duty of over the whole range of buttons with which this Report deals will be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition from foreign countries.      We therefore recommend that a duty of 33^^ ad valorem be imposed upon buttons of all materials (both finished and unfinished) of a description commonly used for the fastening or decoration of apparel, except when already in use on articles of apparel on importation.SECTION II.PINS.  SAFETY PINS, HAIRPINS, HOOKS AND EYES, SNAP FASTENERS, CLOVE DOMES, GRIPS AND SUJILAR FASTENERS.In this part of the enquiry we held 12 public meetings and heard 15 witnesses on behalf of the Applicants. The Opposition called no evidence and contented themselves with submitting that no case for a duty had been made out. At our request they gave information as to Imports into this country of hooks and eyes from the largest manufacturer on the Continent by means of a certified -statement and of hook and eye tape from an American firm through an Importer.Though it was only for convenience that we decided at the outset of the enquiry to hear the evidence on this part
of the application separately,  it became evident to us before we had proceeded very far with this section that we should have some difficulty in treating most of these articles as necessarily on the same footing aa buttons.    It was urged upon us that the same class of labour was concerned and the same channels of distribution employed, and our attention was drawn to the pledge given by the President of the Board of Trade that industries are at liberty to make joint applications where two or more trades are so clearly and closely related to one another that they can reasonably be regarded as a unit.     But giving all the weight we could to these considerations we have   felt ourselves unable to accede entirely to the Applicants &apos; contention.      i/e agree with them that pins, hooks and eyes and snap fasteners, etc., can be linked together, but we do not think that buttons can be included with them&apos; all these articles come under a separate Trade Board- they are mainly produced In factories which make little in the way of buttons, and they can hardly be regarded as interchangeable with buttons in general .use. Even if we had been satisfied that the two sections should properly be treated as one industry we should not have thought ourselves justified in recommending merely for this reason that a duty should be imposed in the case of a variety of articles to which it is obvious that different consider-ation may apply, and In our opinion they must be treated upon their individual merits.We had some doubt whether an exception might not be made in the case of glove domes which are four-piece fasteners and which are mainly substitutes for and akin in appearance (and to some extent also in manufacture) to buttons.     But the only figures we had before us were from one firm in Birmingham whose output was very small and in the
case of another firm whose representative appeared in support of the application the output of these articles was admitted to be negligible.     There is, we were told, at least one other firm engaged in the production of glove domes or similar fasteners which are used not only for gloves but also for purses and bags, but we had no infor-mation as to either their output or costs of manufacture. Under these circumstances we do not feel that we- have sufficient information before us upon v/hich to form an opinion as to the desirability of a duty. 45. The bulk of the evidence was directed to theeners.two-piece or sew-on snap fastener and we note that at the 1922 enquiry when &apos;&apos;snap fasteners&quot; was one of the classes for which protection was claimed four-piece fasteners  (Including glove domes) were definitely excluded from the application. The manufacture of these articles i&amp; essentially a post-war industry and It is with some regret that we feel unable to recommend a duty.     Two of U3 sat on the enquiry of 1922 when the application met with no success mainly for the reason that though the industry had then recently become efficient it had not reached a stage of anything like commercial production.    We feel considerable sympathy with the firms which have continued in the face of great difficulties to struggle on against established foreign competition.     But production in this country has remained at practically the same level since 1922, with the exception of last year, when it exceeded any previous year. 46. We feel little doubt that the cheaper foreignsnap fasteners are being sold in this oountry at prioes with which home manufacturers are unable to oompete, though in the highest classes of well known foreign brands there ia-no question of underselling, the Imported articles-commanding
prices in this country far in excess of those at which fairly competitive home manufactured articles can be marketed.    The outstanding fact seea3 to be that snap fasteners were from the first a speciality of Cggghogioy&amp;klgn and German firms and that though a brave attempt has been made in this country - encouraged, we are told, by promises of assistance from high quarters - the industry has never attained to commercial proportions.      We think that the use of snap fasteners has probably, owing to change of fashion, declined considerably since 1921 or 1922, but the real strength of the foreign competition which is now felt is that they had secured, before any attempt was made to manufacture in this country, such a definite and stable reputation for their higher classes of these goods, that they can afford now to undersell the British-made articles at the lower end of the trade, and It is clear that this is the settled policy of the foreign competing firms.     V,:e are satisfied that large quantities    of cheap foreign snap fasteners are sold in this country below the home manufacturing costs, but there has been no evidence brought before us upon which we could come to the conclusion that imports since the war have been in any way abnormal and unless we could be satisfied of this we feel that it is impossible for us under the terms.of our press reference to report in favour of the application so far as this class of article is concerned. and      47. The manufacture of hooks and eyes in this countryis practically confined to one firm and we received a great deal of detailed and valuable evidence in connection with the trade from tho representatives of this firm.      It was not contested that changes of fashion have considerably reduced the consumption of hooks and eyes.      But the firm&apos;a output in 1920 was greater even than in 1913 and we are informed that
when the slump came In 1921 they were left with large stocks which are still being liquidated.48. Apart from reductions in the actual use of hooksand eyes there have been important changes in the method of marketing which have necessarily affected employment.      In the years immediately following the War, hooks and eyes were normally carded.     The general demand was reduced in 1921-22 by the competition of snap fasteners and change of fsshicn, and the main part of the trade was then with corset-makers who required them loose in boxes.     Llore recently the fashion for hook and eye tape (where the hooks and eyes are 30ld ready attached to tape or linen Instead of either on cards or in boxes) has been rapidly growing and the firm In question appears to have been particularly successful In adapting itself to this development.     Now, when its 1920 stock Is practically exhausted, carding labour is Increasing again to a limited extent.     These changes, while having no appreciable effect on the recent output of actual hooks and eyes, have caused wide variations in employment.    where the hooks and eyes are carded nearly two-thirds of the labour is represented by carders; where they are only boxed the necessary labour-roll is greatly reduced, one girl being able (we are told) to box twelve times as many as she could card in the same period&apos;, where they are taped, employment is again greatly increased though on slightly different lines.49. If those employed on hook and eye tape areIncluded in the employment figures a definite increase is shown.      It was suggested to us that the hook and eye tape section is a separate and new Industry, the figures of which should not be included, with those of the old.      While we admire the Initiative of the firm in taking up this
manufacture, which was originally an American speciality, we feel that it cannot he considered separately from that of the plain hooks and eyos since it is cl-urly only a new development in their use and must Itself compete with and displace the boxed or carded hooks and eyos, while the class of labour employed is the same as that for carding and boxing.The import returns do i-.ot she./ hooks and eyes separately but only as included under the general heading &quot;hard haberdashery&quot;.   Tho figures of direct imports which were furnished to us by the reepesentatlve of the largest Continental manufacturer (see paragraph 42 above) show steadily decreasing imports.     The Applicants contended that these figures were incomplete, boing tho so of one firm Only and not including sales by that firm to continental merchants which might thereafter find thoir way into this country. There may, wo think, bo some truth in this contention, but tho Applicants&apos; witnosjes admitted that the continental firm to which we have referred is certainly the main, if not tho only importer, and wo do not think that tho quantities not inoluded can bo large or would have been likely to follow a different course from that shov.n by the figures which wcro furnished to us.Under the curcumstanccs above detailed we think that no case has boon made out for a duty upon imported hooks and eyes, the compelling factor as in tho previous instance being that no abnormality of imports has been established. We would add that wo have had no evidence of serious unemployment in this industry at present, and we think that any reduction in employment that has taken place either since 1913 or in post-war years has boon duo to causes other than foreign competition.
m&quot;Pins&quot; under our terms of&quot; refer-necessarily include thrco classes (1) solid-headcd pins,  (2) safety pins and (3) hair-pins.    In the case of solid-hoadcd plus it Is admitted by tho applicants that 0Y.ing to changes in tho dross-making trado and tho almost universal demand for ready-made garments tho use of ordinary pins haj fallen off by about 20 per cent, and v;o think that thoro may also bo other directions in which there has boon a decreased user.   Tho quantities nanufactured In this country- howevor, are still very largo, amounting it is estimated to a valuo of  122,000 last year, compared with which tho imports, whatever their exact figure, must in our opinion bo regarded a3 almost negligible.     The import returns refer generally to  ^ins1 making no distinction between the throo classes and they probably also include a certain number of other pins such as hat-pin3 with which we are not concerned in this enquiry. ty Pins. 53.      in safety pins while employment has decreased as aresult we are told, of improved machinery- the home produc-tion has actually Increased during post-war years and has now passed the pre-svar figures owing to tho growing popularity of the &quot;Midget1 pins In the production of which tho British manufacturer appears to bo supreme.    The applicants&apos; estimate of home manufacture last year was  112,000 which, If compared with any possible proportion of the import figures which may bo ascribable to safety pins, doos not suggest that any case for a duty can possibly be made out. Yio are also impressed by tho fact that a firm which admittedly represents two-thirds of the total output of safety pins in this &quot;country is. not a party to the present application.  ins. 54.   , Hairpins now owing to tho change of fashion are not of the same importance as they wore, and thd applicants laid
iBps, etc,little stress on this part of their case.55.    -    No evidence haB been brought before us with regard to &quot;grips or other similar fasteners&quot; not has any argument been addressed to us with reference to them.56. In no one of the classes referred to has it beenestablished by the applicants that anything which could be called abnormal importation exists, and we are, therefore, under the terms of our reference unable for this reason alone to report that a case for a safeguarding duty has been made out.    le now proceed to deal briefly with our answers to each of the questions asked by the &apos;Vfaite Paper, the various headings of which have already been set out in full in Section I of this report.57.      (l) Our answer to this question must we think be in the regative.    7e doubt whether the industry represented by the manufacture of the articles in thiB section which on the highest estimate employed less than. 2,500 persons in 1013 and under 1,500 at present can be said to be of substantial importance either by reason   of the volume of labour employed or of the nature of the product.58.

59.        The imports of these articles may come under all or any of the three headings:- Pins, other Hard Haberdashery and Metal Push Buttons and Studs.   We append to our report tables setting forth the imports and exports under these headings but T^e recognize that they probably also include many articles with which we are not concerned in this enquiry.     It may be noted that the Imports of other hard haberdashery have decreased considerably while those of pins are very small and-push buttons, though subject to considerable ups and downs, have not varied greatly if the figures of 192o and 1927 are-compared.   On the other hand we have direct evidence of a reduction in the Imports of hooks and eyes.60.        We have Indicated In our Introductory paragraphsour reasons for concluding that imports in this section are not abnormal.61. (3) With the exception of the specially high qualitysnap fastener referred to in paragraph 45 we are satisfied that imported articles in all these classes are being-sold here at prices which are below those of profitable manufacture in this country.62. (4) The following are the figures which were supplied bythe Applicants of estimated total employment engaged in the production of the articles in this section.

63. In all these sections employment has been reduced but wethink that this has been mainly d\ie to causes other than foreign competition such as fashion and improved machinery anc in several cases we note that the figures are showing a healthy rising tendency in recent years.64. (5) The competition comes mainly from Germany and czechoslovakia and In this section we had no evidence as to conditions in aiy other country.   As in the buttons section the general conclusion that wages abroad are lover thai in this country was not   disputed and there was again no evidence of subsidies, bounties or other artificial advantages ab ro ad.65. vJages in this Industry are regulated here by the Pin,Hook and JSye and Snap Fastener trade board under which the minijnum r^tes for men are l/5 to lOfd. per hour and for women 7^d. to 6ijd. per hour.   \&apos;e had information as to wages in the pin and hairpin Industry in Germany and the sJnall metal-ware industry in Czechoslovakia,   our conclusion under this head is similar to that in tho case of battens.   We think that wages are so different in the main competing countries from those which are enforced by a trade board in this country as to render the competition &apos;unfair1:66. (6) The efficiencv&quot; of this industry was not contested andwe answer this question in the  affirmative.67. (7) V.&apos;e have had no evidence of any other industry usingpins,    safety pins or hairpins in further production and we have ho reason to think that a duty on hooks and eyes and snap fastene-rs could seriously affect employment in the clothing industry or even in the glove industry.58. In view of otir answers to questions (1)  (2) and (4) butespecially to question (2)  ve do not think that a case for a duty has been made out in this section of the enquiry,,
ISO69.        V?e desire to record our great obligations to ourSecretary ki3S A.Ii. Kilroy.
