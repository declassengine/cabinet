iDOCyMgSrj? IS TH^ PROPERTY CF HIS BdlTANNIC MAJESTY1 S (^aRNMENT.COIY NO.CABINET. SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES.Handkerchiefs and Household Linen Gooods.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade. I circulate to my colleagues the Report of the Committee which was set up under the Safeguarding Procedure to consider an Application for the imposition of a duty on handkerchiefs and on household goods of linen, ootton, jute or hemp (known in the trade as &quot;fancy linens&quot;), excluding plain hemmed sheets and damask goods.    The Committee find that the Applicants have failed to establish a claim for a duty.The application was made by the Handkerchief and Embroidery Association of Belfast, with whom were associated some Dunfermline manufacturers.    Besides the group of Importers and Wholesalers and the Wholesale Textile Association who opposed the application, independent evidence in opposition was given by representatives of Messro. Tootal Broadhurst Lee Co., Ltd- and the Calico Printers&apos; Association Ltd.Unfavourable answers are given to four of the questions in the &quot;White laper&quot; - those concerning abnormal imports, prices, unemployment and unfair oonditions in foreign countries. Prom consideration of the imports, the home production and the 25.    exports, the Committee are of opinion that handkerchiefs generally are not being imported in abnormal quantities although in a small section of the trade (embroidered handkerchiefs) imports are abnormal.    They dn not consider, however, that the position of this section is a guide to the whole industry or that they can recommend a duty on one section only, since this mi^ht divert demand to handkerchiefs not subject to duty and thussr.H2 (28).
render the duty of no effect.   As regards household goods they do not think that the applicants substantially represent tho United Kingdom industry and after a full review of the evidence they conclude that the imports of these goods are not abnormal.   They think it probable that in these articles northern Ireland is suffering more from competition from Lancashire and other parts of England than from foreign countries.The Committee find that handkerchiefs similar to those produoed here are not being imported at prices below those at which they can be profitably manufsotured here.     They agree that Swiss embroidered handkerchiefs are imported at prices with which the British industry cannot compete with its existing machinery, but owing to differences in the method of manufacture they do not regard the produots of the two countries a? comparable within the meaning of the &quot;-fnlte Paper&quot;,As regards fancy linens also the Committee find that, taking United Kingdom manufacturers as a whole, the imported goods are not being sold below the price at which they can profitably be made here.After reviewing the evidence in all its aspects the Committee find that the unemployment which undoubtedly exists in Northern Irelard is not due to the competition of abnormal Imports but to the falling off in export trade and to competition from firms located outside Northern Ireland and Dunfermline, . The Committee find that it oannot be said that the conditions of labour are Inferior in the countries from which the bulk of the imports are obtained as regards hours or wages, to those obtaining in Northern Ireland.     They find, however, that a subsidy within the meaning of the White Paper has been given by the Swiss Government to the Swiss embroidery industry;   this subsidy comes to an end in June next.
The Committee ai*e of opinion that the industry is of substantial importance by reason of the volume of employment and that It is being carried on with reasonable efficiency and economy.   As regards the effect on using industries, they state that it cannot strictly be said that any of the goods concerned are &quot;used in production&quot;, but they point out that if a duty were imposed it might have serious effects on our export trade, both of materials in the piece and made-up goods.   A considerable quantity of British goods is sent to Switzerland to be embroidered and returned to this country for completion.I propose to proceed with the publication of the Report at once, but in view of the conclusions reached by the Committee, I cannot recommend the imposition of a duty.P.C-L.Board of Trade,27th April, 1928.

SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES.RSPOUT OF HANDK5RCHIEFS AND HOUSEHOLD LIN3B GOODS COMMITTEE.The Right Honourable Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E., M.C., M.P., President of the Board of Trade,Sir,1,   We were appointed on the 18th January to be a Committee to enquire into an application for the imposition of a duty upon handkerchiefs and household goods of linen, cotton, jute or hemp but excluding plain hemmed sheets and damask goods.2.   We have held sixteen meetings, and received evidence from 24 witnesses, a   list of whom will be found in appendix H. The greater part of the evidence was given in public, only confidential matters being dealt with in camera.   During the hearing of the confidential evidence, Counsel and solicitors were present so that such evidence was fully examined and was subject to cross-examination by the respective parties.3.   We desire to express appreciation of the services of the Statistical Department of the Board of Trade fbr the preparation of   many statistical tables relevant to the enquiry, several of which are appended to this report.4,   The Applicants were the Handkerchief and Embroidery Association of Belfast, with whom were associated some Dunfermline manufacturers.     Representatives of two Trade Unions gave evidence in support of the application.5.   The application was opposed by a group of Importers and Wholesale Houses, and the Wholesale Textile Association who co-operated In order to obviate any \uidue lengthening of the enquiry.     Independent evidence in opposition was given by representatives of Messrs. Tootal Broadhurst Lee Co., Ltd., and The Calico Printers&apos; Association Ltd,
6.   Both sides were represented by Counsel, Mr. W.Barnard Faraday (instructed by Messrs. Kackrell, Ward &amp; Knight) appearing for the Applicants, and Mr. A.S. Corayns Carr, K.C., and Mr. CF, Eatwistle (instructed by Messrs. Stilceman &amp; Co.) on behalf of the Opponents.   Mr. H. Broadoont (instructed by Messrs.   ..3oote, Edgar &amp; Rylands) appealed on behalf of Messrs. Tootal Broadhurst Lee Co., Ltd,, and the Calico Printers&apos; Association Limited.70   The application covered a vory wide field and some difficulty was exparienced during the hearing in framing a comprehensive definition which would cover all the articles concerned.,   The Applicants submitted the follov/ing concise definition, and a supplementary comprchonsive definition.CONCISE DEFINITION. 1.   All Handkerchiefs woven of Textile material other thansilk and Artificial Silk. 20    Made-up goods for household purposes,  (except plain-hemmed sheets) or such goods partly made-up;    cross-bordered;    printed;   hemmod;   hemstitched;   worked or embroidered to such extent as to identify them to the purpose for which they are intended, itien such goods are made, or partially made as above doscribod on any textile mate-rial other than silk or damask0LIST OF ARTICLES IN RESPECT OF application is PlaDE.1*    All handkerchiefs and scarves made up or manvifacturod or sufficiently made up to establish thoir idontity except those manufactured of textile fabric of silk or artificial silk02.    HOUSEHOLD ARL;ICI.ES.All articles made up (or sufficiently made up or manufactured to establish their identity) of any textile
material other than silk, artificial silk or damask; plain, hemmed, hemstitched, spoked, overlooked, scalloped, fancy or thread-drawn stitched, embroidered in cotton, flax, silk, jute, artificial silk or other fibre, tamboured, printed, dyed or woven with cross borders, stencilled or attached to or decorated or embellished with crochet or lace, whether worked by hand or machine and including Pillow cases, 3ag Tops, Bolster Covers, Bolster Sets, Cushion Covers, Laundry Bags, Cosey Covers, Night Dress Cases, Pyjama Cases, Brush and Comb Bags, Handkerchief Sachets, Table Centres, Doyleys, Mats, Tea and other Napkins, liork Bags, Runners, Scarves, Side-Eoard Covers, Tray Cloths, Tea Cloths, Supper Cloths, Duchess Covers, Duchess Sets, Toilet Covers, Toilet Sets, Cheval Sets, Wash-Stand Sets, Towels, Napkins, Bedspreads, Sheets, Valances, Valance Sets, Sheet Shams, Pillow Shams, Bridge Sets, Tea Sets, Luncheon Sets, Chair Backs, Sofa Backs, Dinner Sets, Carving Cloths, Squares, Ovals, Rounds, Oblongs, Pram Covers, Pram Canopy Covers,   aid other articles ejusdem generis for table, toilet furniture or personal U3e excepting plain hemmed shsets and also excepting any article wholly produced on a loom to which no further labour or process is applied in the form of making up hemming or embroidering, hem or fancy stitching and further excepting any article of apparel other than handkerchiefs and scarves.Both of these definitions were fully considered, but it was obvious to the Committee that if a duty were to be imposed, the drafting of the definition would need more attention.   We therefore only accepted these definitions In order to Indicate to all concerned the types of goods which tha Applicants desired to come within the scope of the proposed duty.   We deferred re-drafting the definition until such time as we had fully considered our conclusions.     In view of the
fact that th.) application only originally r.*lfttsd tohandler.rchinfs in tho mado-up state, ws ruled during th i anquiithat only completed, handkerchiefs could bo considered by the committee, and not materials in the piece, ombroidered orotherwise, intended to be made into handkerchief s08.   The Applicants stated that their industry was of(substantial importance;   it employed normally 25,000 workers,and in addition 16,000 out-workorso     The out-workars we wereinformod were mainly wives and relations of agricultural andother workers scattered throughout Northern Ireland, wholargely depencTod for their subsistence upon hand embroidory.These out-workers during roccnt years have practically ceased to bs employed through a supplanting of hand embroidery bymachine embroidery.   It was the hope of the Applicants that a duty   v;ould maintain this old established cottage industry   idrestore prosperity to tho thousands of persons concerned,,They complained that imports were being retained in abnormalquantities, and that competition was being felt from thefollowing countries - Switzerland- Germany, Czecho-Slovak!a,Japan, Prance, Hollend, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Portugal and poland.    They   alleged that wages in the above countries werelower than in Nor thorn Ireland, and that hours of labourwere longer.     Thoy also stated that the Swiss industry hadbonofitod by a subsidy from tho Swiss Governments   They claime 1a duty of 33 /3/j on all imported handkerchiefs end household goods of cotton, linen, juta and hemp,  and also on materials in the piece, alroady embroidered or otherwise decorated, provided that thoy wore readily identifiable and clearly intended to be manufactured into the abovo articles *   Thoy stated that in tho majority of caoos tlio only work necessary on the embroidery Imported was tho cutting out Into the variou articles and possibly hemstitching.
W -i. kJ9.    The Opponents while not challenging the substantial importance of the industry taken as a whole pointed out that the Applicants were really an aggregation of smaller units, some of which if taken separately were by no means substantial.    This particularly referred to the machine embroidery section which was very small in comparison with that of other countries.     They also indicated that the Applicants were not fully representative of the Industry of the United Kingdom as a large and increasing amount of handkerchiefs and household goods are being manufactured in Lancashire, Nottingham, Birmingham and the South of England.     They denied that conditions of employment of labour, whether respecting remuneration or hours of employment, were inferior on the Continent to the conditions obtaining in Northern Ireland.    They also contended that the Swiss subsidy was not an artificial aid within the meaning of the White Paper.     The Opponents maintained that in the types of goods in which Northern Ireland specialises the applicants have a virtual monopoly, whereas the imported articles are mainly goods not manufactured by the Applicants,      They stated that the Applicants were not suffering from the competition of imported goods, alleging that they were probably much more affected by competition from other parts of the United Kingdom as indicated above.      They further contended that a duty would not be beneficial to Northern Ireland as the goods now Imported would continue to be obtained froiVt abroad, and the only effect of the duty would therefore be to raise prices to the consumer.    They also feared loss of export and re-export trade.
10.    erasers. Too tax Broadhurst Lee Co. Ltd., opposed tho application for a duty on handkerchiefs on the  round that such a duty was unnecessary as they were in a position to meet competition from any source. They stated that tho number of their empl03rees engaged in the manufacture of handkerchiefs had nearly doubled since 1514, and that their sales in the home market during the two years 13 G and 1S27 ..ere four times in value in the home trade and five times in exports those of the years 1912 and 1SI3.    They have installed the most up-to-date labour saving machinery by means of which the production of each worker is one third higher than in pre-war days.    If a duty sere imposed they feared a demand for higher wages which would have an adverse effect on other industries employing stitchers, such as shirt mehufacturers who purchase larg*e quantities of material from chem.    They contended t:.at as they were successfully meeting foreign competition botr. in the home arid foreign markets the imposition of a duty is unnecessary, ana would be harmful, and they felt that a duty might re-act on other trades and lead to a general increase in the cost of production to such an extent as would make it increasingly difficult to compete in foreign markets.11.    The Calico i-rinters&apos;  Association Ltd..,, objected on general economic grounds,  stating, that if the proposed duty prevented foreigners from selling their goods in the home market, competition vvould be keener abroad in the markets which we nov. hold.    They contended that the duty would raise prices ana.tend to reduoe the demand for the goods under consideration.
a letter from the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-Operative Congress opposing tiie application but as they declined to ^Ive ox-ai evidence wo do not pz-opose to coiament on their letter.    Agents in Madeira of Belfast and Iianchester Houses who sell materials in the piece to the local hand embx-oidory industry also wrote to the Committee urging that Madeira embrolcery should be exempted from the proposed duty as the materials used were mainly of British origin.    As they did not supplement their letter by oral evidence, we offer no comment in this instance also.IS.    We now beg to report as follows under the sub-headings of the White Paper,  (Cmd. 2327).(1) V-hether the applicant ir.t;r..s try is,  by reap on., of the^ volume of emp3.oyn;er.t r-ny ed in tite product.i on jn  the ftOods to which the aipl-t cation relate-^, , or by reason of the nature of the goers produeed,  sn industry of sr.&apos;ogt*uticl iiEi-ortanco.v,,14.    The Applicants circularised their members endeavoui&quot;ing to obtain full information as to the numbers employed and hours worked,    he plies were received from 57 members whn employed et a recent date 15,010 workers. 27 Trade Stitchers did not complete the return and it was. estimated that they employed  ,252 workers, and 23 Trade Stitchers who have left the trade since 1913 employed 1,384.    It was stated that SO manufacturers who have closed down since 1913 employed 2,040 and 22 manufacturers who are still in existence but failed to send in returns had 2,300 workers.    This gives an   estimated total of 23,423 to which should be added a further 5,000 to cover Trade Stitchers,  textile printers, laundry finishers, box makers and small manufacturers who are scattered throughout
Northern Ireland.    It was stated that these figures do not include out-wnrlcers who in 1918 were estimated at 16,000, and were largely hand embroiderers who are now unemployed.15. It was the applicants main contention that they were suffering from competition from Swiss embx*oidered goods but it was made clear to us that before the War the S,viss machine Embroidery Industry was in flourishing condition.    In 1902 an inspector was sent to Switzerland by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland to report on the conditions of the -knbroidery Industry in that country.    He came back with a favourable report and steps were taken to establish a Machine imbroidery Industry in Northern Ireland.    Eight machines were installed in 1911 and a school established for in-struction purposes.    In 1912 a further ten machines were installed and the industry developed until 1916 when owing to the War it became impossible to import the machines from Switzerland.    The number of Embroidery Machines of the hand-operated tjrpe in Northern Ireland is now estimated at 172 empl03ring 456 workers.    thes are in addition to the number of workers mentioned in the previous para&amp;rapn. It is this section of the industry which the Opponents claim is not of substantial importance when compared ..ith the Sv/iss industry, which, although it has destroyed many machines during recent years,  still possesses,3,130 Schiffli machines (automatic) and 3,670 hand embroidery machines.    We might explain that the   above embroidery machines embroider several dozen articles at once: e.g.5^-&apos; 13,  or 19,  dozen, whereas in Northern Ireland there are many machines o.? a different type which only embroider one article at a time besides the 172 machines mentioned above which are similar to tho hand operated machines in Switzerland.
16.     In our vlev; It has been established that the applicant Industry Is of substantial Importance. (2) whether foreign roods of the class or description toitfhjLch the appl ic at lor, relate s are belzir; import ed into and retained for consumption In the United Kingdom In abnormal quantities. 17.   This question presents no little difficulty as the classification in the Trade Returns has changed considerably since 1913 and it is almost impossible, particularly for household goods, to make reliable comparisons with pre-i4ar years.   &apos;..e have, however, given due consideration to the various tables of retained Imports and exports which are given in detail in Appendices A to G and in addition have drawn inferences as to the trend of the trade from the evidence given by both sides.   Although the Applicants maintained that large quantities of handkerchiefs and fancy linen goods were imported by parcel post the evidence of the opponents v,as to tne contrary.   Representatives of several of the largest wholesale firms engaged in this trade assured us that apart from samples only a negligible quantity of the roods with.which we are concerned came Into this country by parcel post.   As the Opponents, however, admitted that there are probably hundreds of firms trading in fancy linen goods in this country the evidence was not sufficient to enable us to express an opinion as to the extent of the imports by parcel post.10.   The Applicants main contention with regard to embroidered goods was, that whereas before the w*ar itorthern Ireland was supreme in this industry, since the Par Switzerland has largely ousted Irish hand-embroidery from, the&quot; home- market by embroidered goods made mainly on Schiffli Machines.   These machines, it was stated, were engaged prior to the \7ar in the manufacturo of embroidery
090 t* uin the piece for women&apos;s wear, mainly lingerie, but ov/ing to change of fashion this type of embroidery Is no longer purchased to the same extent.   The Swiss firms therefore adapted their machinery for embroidering handkerchiefs and fancy linen goods.    It was contended that the cost of embroidering on these machines was very low and that tho work was principally carried on in Switzerland and the Vorarlberg.   The Applicants urged that the installation of the Schiffli machine for these articles would be uneconomical and that if a manufacturer were about to set up an embroicery concern in Northern Ireland the Schiffli machine would not be considered this statement was supported by several of their witnesses.19.   The Opponents stated that the Schiffli machine did not need any adaptation for handkerchiefs and fancy linen goods and that the products of this machine which were nov. being extensively imported could not be regarded as competitive as they were, in effect different articles from those produced in Northern Ireland.20.&apos; In our view, however, we must 100-- at the imports as a whole contrasting them, with the production of the Applicants who also&apos; suggested that the ratio of imports to production was a fair guide whether imports were abnormal. We woui&apos;1 add that in our opinion the exports should also be examined and we nov; express our conclusions based on the information we have received on all these points.21.   The Applicants estimated that their turnover during the past seven years as compared with ISIS was as follows: -

They obtained from representative firms their turnover in each of the years specified together with the percentage of their turnover which ?/as exported.     The average export and home trade arrived at from these figures was as follows.-1913       1221        1922       1223       1924        1925       1926        192759.2	60.5	57.1	54.7	58.3	59.7	59.8	60.240.8  .	39.5	42.9	45.3	41.7	40.3	40.2	39.6100.0	100.0	100.0	100.0	100.0	100.0	100.0	100.0They regarded these percentages as being a fair average applicable to the whole trade.   They therefore took the total exports of handkerchiefs in each of the years as shown by the Trade Returns as follows:-1613*  1,7 20,0701924  3,265,6911921  2,662,0671925  3,265,954 *   Estimated.1922  2,884,4801226  3,012,5721923  3,044,0431927  2,693,110and assumed that those exports bore the relation stated above to the total turnover.   They then used the export percentage as a factor to enable then to estimate the total production. Thus, in 1927,  exports were  2,693,110, which they claimed
were 60.2^ of their production; their total output was therefore estimated at  4,473.605.   As an indication of the reprc3entive nature of the firms whoso turnover was taken as the basis of calculation we might state that 21 firms gave full information from 1913 to 1927.    In 1913 their turnover totalled  1,392,572 and in 1927  1,984,305.22.   The turnover of fancy linens was built up from returns actually received and an estimate was made of tho produotion by firms from whom no returns were received and also from those who had gone out of the trade.    It should be stated that of  1,252,279 estimated as the turnover for 1927 returns were received amounting to  992,279 so that the proportion estimatad is not high.   It i3 necessary to add that the applicants estimate of production covered IT.Ireland and some firms in Pumfermline.   They considered that the production of household linen goods by English firms would only be valued at about  100,000*   This was shown to b6 an under-estimate as state in paragraph 27.25.   We propose first to deal with handkerchiefs, and in this connection would refer to Appendices A to C.   The&apos;&quot; figures for 1913 are not available and in the body of this report, we do not think it necessary to deal with the eight years given in the Appendices.    We shall therefore only deal with 1921, 1925, 19 6 and 1927 disregarding 1920 as being an abnormal year.    The intermoaiate years are given in the Appendices and do not affect our conclusions.     It will be seon that the values- of the Retained Imports were as under:-

In 1921 theretained imports were 0.3.&quot;.&apos; of their production rnd haveincreased to 2.4/ in 1227.      This certainly shows an increasebut if the retained imports in 1227 were only 2.4  of the applicants&apos;production we cannot regard this small proportion as beingabnormal.     We would also draw attention to the increasingimports of linen handkerchiefs from the Irish Free State from1925 to 1227 as shown in appendix C.      These imports were greater than those from foreign sources and are not include 1in the above table.      It was explained by the Applicants that these were probably from Branch Houses of some of the Applicants&apos;concerns just over the border.24.     In dealing with this section we think that we must have general regard to the trend 01&quot; the trade as a whole, and we find (see Appendices A to C) that the Exports from the United kingdom for the same years were as under:-

From the above table it will be seen that the outstanding feature is the increase in the exports of linen handkerchiefs with which the manufacturers of Northern Ireland are mainly concerned, i.e. from 1,407,771 doz. In 1921 to 5,061,447 doz. in 1927.    It will also be observed that In each case the exports are very much greater than the retained imports and in fact the latter appear by comparison almost  -negligible.    It will be noticed from Appendices A to C that the imports from Sv/itzerland are greater than from any other country and are probably in the main embroidered handkerchiefs.    It Is this competition  of which K. Ireland is complaining, but for reasons which v/e state later (para.24) we do not regard them as strictly comparable with the Irish product.    It appears likely that Swiss embroidered handkerchiefs would not wholly be included in the above tables but some proportion - particularly those embroidered in the piece - would be in the Embroidery and Needlework category (Appendix F. )25.    V/e would Lav:e preferred to have examined 1913 figures - this being an old established Indus try - but as these articles were not separately recorded before the War we have had  to con-sider the general trend during the past seven years and we think this Is sufficient to enable a conclusion to be drawn.    In our opinion the Applicants have not proved their contention that foreign handkerchiefs are being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities. It is true however that in a small section of the trade, viz. embroidered handkerchiefs imports are increasing and from this point of view the Applicants have proved their claim.   We do not consider that the state of trade in this section can be taken as a guide to the whole industry nor can v/e recommend a duty on one section of the handkerchief trade alone as clearly this might have tho effect of diverting demand to handkerchiefs not subject to duty and thus render the duty of no of feet,
OOPu is 025.   Tiae position with regard to household goods is not easy to ascertain.   Eo import figures are available for pre-war years, but for 1920 to 1927 probably the bulk of the ^rooda would be included under the headings:- made-up. cotton roois for household purposes, linen manufactures not elsewhere specified and embroidery and needlework made by machinery on fabrics other than net or dissoluble fabrics. Particulars of these are given in Appendices D to P.   At first view It would seem that the applicants  claim that imports are abnormal 13 justified particularly in the case of made up cotton gooda for household purposes and linen manufactures not elsewhere specified.     These headings would inclnde plain hemmed sheets and demaak goods which were outside the scope of the enquiry, but the Applicants estimated that of the cotton household gooes 15;.- would be competitive with them in 1921 and 3375;- during the last three years.     Half the linen manufactures they claimed to be competitive, but the embroidery and needle-work   table they disregarded as being misleading owing to the fall in the demand for embroidery in the piece which they stated would be largely covered by this heading. They therefore referred to the exports from Switzerland to the United Kingdom under several headings, namely -(1) Cotton embroideries of crochet work hand or machine made other than cxirtains (blinds, window curtains, etc.)(-2) Feather stitch embroidery made by the embroidery machine or shuttle loom which includes fancy articles and dresses, galloons, figures, handker-chiefs, etc.
(3) Confections (made up goods) of cotton, linen, ramie, etc, including pocket handkerchiefs of cotton or linen hemmed with embroidery monogram. The total of these three items shov;ed an increase from  302,764 in 1921 to  746,677 in 1927.    In addition they referred to the Swiss improvement trade which shows that whereas in 1913 26,700 kgs. of materials In the piece were cent from the United Kingdom to Switzerland for embroidering or hem stitching etc., and returned to the United Kingdom, the quantity had increased to 83,600 kgs. in 1925.    In addition 3^600 kgs. were sent to Switzerland In 1913 for embroidering, hemstitching etc., to be forwarded to a third country and this quantity had increased in 1926 to 54,300 kgs.    Vie cannot say with any certainty what articles are covered by these headings but many witnesses stated that there has been an increasing tendency for handkerchiefs in the piece to be sent to Switzerland for embroidering, not only by English but also Northern Ireland manufacturers.27. The Applicants&apos; production of fancy linens was stated to be  1,262,279 in 1927.   This amount covers the production of Northern Ireland and some Dunfermline firms but excludes England.    In that year the exports from the United kingdom of &quot;made up cotton goods for household purposes&quot; amounted to  5,007,000 while the exports of &quot;linen manufactures not else-whore specified&quot; were valued at  348,000 or a total for these two items of  3,355 , 000.    This is approximately three times the applicants  production and even assuming that a large part of these goods are articles outside the scope of our enquiry such as plain hemmed sheets and damask goods it is inconceivable that the amount of comparable goods is small and in any case some part of the Applicants production must be sold in the home market,    ;ve consider therefore that tho Applicants cannot
substantially represent the united Kingdom Industry as it is obvious that the whole of the united Kingdom production is not exported and some allowance must be made for sales in the Home market which renders the proportion of the total production by the applicants much smaller than that of the remainder of the united Kingdom.   The evidence given by importers and representa-tives of wholesale houses tended to show that the value of the household goods produced by English manufacturers had been very much underestimated by the Applicants.    The Opponents also demonstrated to us that a substantial quantity of the goods now imported are of a different type from those made by the applicants.    ;e were unable to ascertain what proportion of these goods were included In the Imports,    -hile we admit that the tables show a decided increase in retained imports under two headings, the third table, machine-mad? embroidery and needle-work shows a very great decline.   It is impossible, however, to say what proportion of the embroidery imports would come under this category and the Applicants themselves disregarded the united kingdom statistics preferring to rely on the figures relating to the exports from -Switzerland.    Taking all the circvimstances into consideration and after a full review of the evidence we do not consider the Applicants have established their claim that the retained imports are^abnonnal..   It Is in our view highly probable that Northern Ireland is suffering more from the competition from Lancashire and other parts of Kn^land than from foreign imports, and this point r/ill be further dealt v/ith later on in our report.
000t; u J(3) Whether the foreign goods so imported are being; sc-ldar offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured or produced in the UnitedKingdom.27.     The Applicants submitted as evidence over 20 different types of handkerchiefs and in each case they endeavoured to establish that their cost price was higher than that of the foreign manufacturer.      The foreign handkerchiefs were from Austria, Switzerland,  Italy and Prance.      The iVhite Paper requests us to contrast similar goods but the Applicants were only able to compare similar articles in but few instances and in these cases the samples were specially made in order to arrive at their cost of production.    The remainder were either of a different texture, different types of embroidery or dyeing and finish generally.    The evidence of the Applicants, therefore,  did not convince us that the costings which they submitted were for goods similar in all respects to those being imported.    Several of their witnesses however proved to our satisfaction that it was cheaper to send handkerchiefs to Switzerland to be embroidered than to embroider the goods themselves.    The hemstitching was Invariably done in Northern Ireland so the difference in cost in the two countries depended upon the embroidery and we deal with this in the next paragraph.28.     The Opponents contended that in plain and printed handkerchiefs the United Kingdom practically had a monopoly and the import figures quoted in paragraph 23 seem to bear out this statement.    With regard to embroidered handkerchiefs, the Applicants themselves admitted that there was little demand to-day on the home market for hand embroidered handkerchiefs their main market being the United States of
-Aueri^a.   The embroidered handkerchiefs now being imported from Switzerland at a lower price than the Irish hand embroidered article, or even lower than those embroidered on the hand-embroidery machine in Northern Ireland are not In our view comparable articles with the Irish products. The Swiss handkerchiefs are mainly embroidered on the Schiffli maohine which produces enormous quantities at a low cost of production.     Many Schiffli machines in Switzerland are installed in the homes of the workers, and it is the practice of many British firms to send materials In the piece to Switzerland to be embroidered on this machine, the material then being returned to be hemstitched, folded, boxed, etc.     Although it might be said that these handkerchiefs compete with the Irish product inasmuch as they are both handkerchiefs and therefore substitutes for one another, we cannot In comparing figures disregard the inherent differences in the embroidery in the two countries.29.    We wou&apos;: d draw attention to the average export and import prices of &quot;cotton flags, handkerchiefs and shawls not in the piece&quot; which show that the export price during the past four years is about one half that of the import price.      We can therefore only conclude that the articles are not similar ?/ithin the meaning of the iVhite Paper. It is quite probable that our exports are mainly plain or printed handkerchiefs whereas the imports are mainly embroidered on the Schiffli machine.     The mere fact that our exports of cotton handkerchiefs are so many times the imports as Indicated In paragraphs 23/4 seems to how that British manufacturers on the whole can successfully meet foreign competition.     The same remarks apply to linen handkerchiefs as the exports of these have increased
considerably during recent years.      If our manufacturers can compete so successfully In the markets of the world and overcome tariffs in many foreign countries, it is but reasonable to assume that their prices on the whole cannot be high when compared vdth those of foreign manufacturers with whom they must also be in competition abroad.30.     The evidence of the Opponents dealt largely with the advantages of the ichiffli machine which we have already considered.    The Chairman of one of the largest handkerchief houses in the wholesale trade gave us particulars of the extent of his purchases from British and foreign manufacturers.     Expressed in percentages, they were as foll^ws:-Poreign. British.1913........        50%     .....      50%1925........        42%      .....      58%1986. .......       51%     .....      49%1927........        54%%    .....      65%%The above figures are besed on values and the firm&apos;s total purchases in 1927 were over six times those of 1913. Another large wholesale buyer of handkerchiefs gave particulars of his purchases during the past three years. Expressed in percentages they were as under: -Irish. Scottish. English. Swiss.1925               65%           10% 15%             10%1926               62%           10% 15%             15%1927               60%           10% 15%             15%Both of the above witnesses submitted numerous samples of foreign and British handkerchiefs in order to demonstrate that British manufacturers could meet foreign competition successfully in the types of goods
ej c\ cyIt a him which they specialise and that in plain and printed handkerchiefs there is little or no competition.    With regard to fancy handkerchiefs some of the largest Irish houses can compete successfully, but it would appear that many of the Imported handkerchiefs are purchased on account of novelty, and price was not necessarily the determining factor.     We would also refer to the evidence of the representative of Messrs. Tootal Broadhurst, Lee Co. Ltd. who stated that the value of their sales of handkerchiefs during the last two financial years in the home market was more than four times as great as It was during the years 1912 to 1913, and the value of their export trad--&quot; during the last two financial years was more than five tlxes as great as in the years 1912 to 1913. This witness stated that they would still produce their handkerchiefs cheap enough to meet all competition, both hotae and foreign, and that they were able to do this through the efficiency of their plant,31.     With regard to handkerchiefs we have arrived at the conclusion that foreign handkerchiefs similar to th--se produced by the Applicants are not being imported at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom,    We agree with the applicants however that in the case of handkerchiefs embroidered on the Schlffli machine prices are in many cases lower than those at which embroidered handkerchiefs can be   profitably manufactured in the United Kingdom on existing machinery. For the reasons stated in para.28 we do not regaro the products of the two countries as comparable within the meaning of the White paper.
9 rQt*c532,     7:1 til regard to household goods, the Applicants submitted over 60 samples to shot.&apos; the types of goods being imported, and of vrhich they complain.     &quot;hey also rave us their estimated cost of each article.     In many cases the foreign samples had been purchased from re-tailers, and in some instcnces during sales.     This Y/S3 not therefore a true comparison ss It is well-known that st sole times It frequently happens that sane articles are sold at prices much below those at v:hich they could be obtained in the normal 7;ay of business.     On the whole the evidence of the i.pplicants tended to show that foreign prices were lower then British for some articles but not for every item.33.     The fvncy linen trade covers a wide variety of (roods and the Opponents submitted evidence tending to prove that many of the types of goods imported are not made here.     Examples of these were.-(a) Out out Richelieu work;(b) Articles embroidered on the Schiffli machine;(c) &apos;oven tapestry articles;(d) loods trimmed with lace, e.r.. Cluny andTeneriffe;(e) Rand and machine painted articles.This evidence was not seriously challenged by the Applicants who contended that all these articles were in competition with the products of Northern Ireland, inas-mupli as they displaced the British articles from the Home market and if tho foreign articles were not available then the Irish goods would bo demanded instead.     V-ith regard to Schiffli embroidery In particular, the Opponents contended that it is a totally different type of embroidery from that produced in Northern Ireland. It is practically   embroidery   by   mas production or? -CO-
and is cheaper than any type produced hy the Applicants. They therefore stated that It would not he fair to compare the price of an article inanuf actxxred In Northern Ireland with a similar product made on the Schiffli machine as none of these machines are in operation in Ireland.34.   From the foregoing It will he seen that in many respects we were not able to compare the price of strictly comparable articles so that we have examined the evidence of leading wholesale houses as to the trend of the trade.     One important house in this class of trade submitted catalogues for 1911, 1913 and 1917.     From these it appears that the numbers of foreign and British articles catalogued were as under:-Total.       Foreign. 1911 27S. 117 .       42 1913 459 201 .       43;.-1927 631 215 c       33% So far as the number of erticles are concerned, therefore, the British has increased since 1913.     In 1913 the value of their foreign purchases were 50/:J of the total, and In 1927 only 38^,     This firr^s turnover has increased considerably sir.ee 1913, but their total purchases in 1927 show an   increase of 237;-. over 1913 as regards foreign purchases, but the British purchases show an increase of 41l ,     In 1213   12c64;i of the British goods were obtained from parts of the United Kingdom outside Northern Ireland and Lunfermline, whereas in 1927 these purchases have increased to 24.7S,CC&quot;, thus indicating that the Applicants have lost ground to other parts of the United Kingdom.
35. Other witnesses for the Opponents gave similar evidence as to the increase in purchases from English manufacturers as opposed to Irish, and also as to the types or goods imported from abroad which are not made -within the United Kingdom, Instancing particularly Madeira, Cluny and f e tieriffe work.36. With regard to fancy linens we are of the opinion that    taking United Kingdom manufacturers as a whole, the imported goods are not be In sc. sold at pricon which are below the prices at which similar Roods can be profitably manufactured in the United Kingdom.(4) Whether, by reason of the severity and extent ofsuch competition, employment in the manufacture or production of such goods in the United kingdom is being, or is likely to be, seriously affected.37. The Applicants, as the result of a questionnaire sent to their members, compiled a statement which tended to show that the number of hours worked had fallen from 43,643,000 in 1213 to 22,546,000 in 1227 i.e.  a reduction of 32.3^. Fart of this was based on estimates in the same way that tho numbers employed were ascertained as referred to in paragraph 14.   The statement covered firms from which full details were received and an estimate was made as to those from which no returns were received and those which had left the trade since 1913.    57 firms gave detailed figures and in the oase of these firms which represented 15,010 workers out of 23,453 the number of hours worked had fallen from 23 millions in 1913 to 19.5 millions in 12 27.    This was a reduction of only 16?i, or one half of the percentage given for that of the industry taken as a whole.    Of these firms,
13 showed a decided increase over 1913, ana many ox&apos; these are large concerns.     Three other fir roe for which no 1913 figures were available showed a greater number of hours vorlcedin 1927 than in any year since 1P29.     The remainder showed a decline.    It seems that in some cases tho large concerns have been able to increase their business at the expense of the smaller manufacturers, but some of the firms which showed increases are only of moderate size.     The applicants stated that 53 firms had gone out of the trade since 1913, and the total number of workers involved was juat under 7,000.    In addition they estimated that 16,000 out-workers had ceased to bo employed.   With regard to the reduction in hours as a whole, wo v/ould state that wages and hours of employment in this industry arc regulated by a Irade xioard, and the hours,  generally, have been reduced as compared with 1915,  but some firms ax^e even now working shorter hours than those laid down by the Trade isoard,    i.o. 44 hours per week instead of 47.    In acme cases the normal week has been reduced from 55 hours in 1913 to 44 in 1927, but in other cases the reduction was not ao great.       The reduction of hours in the normal working week would therefore account to some extent for the reduced number of hours worked in 19 27 as compared with 1913.58.   We are asked to report as to whether unemployment is due to the severity and extent of competition from retained imports, and in thia connection It is necessary to consider many factors. With regard to out-workers we were assured that they were mostly engaged on hand embroidery, and with
respect to handkerchief3 the Applicants informed us that hand embroidered handkerchiefs are no longer demanded in any ruantity by the home market, and that the largest ds-mand 7ias for export mainly to the United States of America. It follows, therefore, that unemployment in this section FAist be mainly attributed to a loss in the export markets, or else to the substitution of plain and printed handkerchief in which the United kingdom manufacturers dominate the home market,    several witnesses for the applicants mentioned that certain Dominions and foreign countries were now producing handkerchiefs thems^lves, only obtaining   materials in the piece from this country.   A further factor wiuh respect to handkerchiefs is the reduction in size since the  ,ar. It was estimated by the Opponents that 25;. less hemstitching is now required In ladies&apos; handkerchiefs as compared with 1912 since during that time the size of the kandkerchief has been reduced from lo^-&quot; to 10&quot;.   There has also been a reduction In the size of mens&apos; handkerchiefs, but, not to the same extent.    It must also b** remembered that thr:re are many firms in Lancashire dealing nith handkerchiefs and it has been estimated that 80...    flf their hemstitching is done in Northern Ireland.    It follows, therefore, that if the amount of hemstitching per-handkerchief has been reduced by 25,. a considerable amount of unemployment would result, particularly as we have had no evidence as to an increased demand lor handkerchiefs to anything like the same extent.    The development of the industry in England must also be taken into consideration.    -e have already mentioned one Manchester firm who employ nearly double thenumber of persons than in 1013, and we have been
t-* c Oinformed of many other firms in England who are developing the production of handkerchiefs and fancy lin-?ns.    h&quot;o vsould also point out that in 1913 the exports from the United i.ingdom of printed cotton flags, handkerchiefs and shawls not in the piece amounted to 31,478,700 linear yards, and in 1927 to 15,535,939 linear yards.   To this falling off in the export trade should no doubt bo attributed some proportion of the under employment amongst hemstitchers in Northern Ireland, and Is also probably the reason why several firms have been forced out of existence in that country.   This reduction has largely been caused by increased manufacture of handkerchiefs in ths Dominions and certain foreign countries already referred to.   At the same time we must again refer to tho  large increase in the exports of linen handkerchiefs which are those mainly produced in Northern Ireland and which certainly shows that &quot;united kingdom manufacturers cr*&apos;. holding their own in their particular speciality as we have not been informed of any sr-riouc competition in linen handkerchiefs. ..ith regard to household goods, it is clear ti at the substitution of printed bedspreads for white embroidered uedspreads since the -ar lias affected the Irish industry, but a duty could not alter fashion in this respect, and moreover the printed bedspreads are largely manufactured by British firms.39.   After reviewing the evidence in all its aspects we cannot say that the unemployment which undoubtedly exists in Northern Ireland^is duo to jhe^severity and extent of the competition from retained imports.     It is in our visa due mor^ to the falling off of the export
*j w (L7trad.* owin.7 to the increased manufacture- of handker-chiefs In the dominions and in certain foreign countries. huh respect to handkerchiefs and household goods it is our opinion that Northern Ireland is also suffering from competition from firms located outside Northern Ireland and juaf ermline.(5)   ^hetii^r such exception-.! competition comeslargely from countries ijhere the conditions are so different from those in this country as to render the competition unfair.Competition for, the purpose of such enquiry is not to be deemed to be unfair unless it arises from one or more of the following causes;-(?.) &quot;Depreciation of currency operating so as to create an export bounty.(b) Subsidies, bounties, or other artificial advantages.(c) Inferior conditions of employment of labour, whether as respects remuneration or hours of employment, or otherwise, obtaining: amongst the persons employed in the production of the imported goods In question as compared with those obtaining amongst persons employed in the pro-duction of similar goods in the United Kingdom.In making their report upon the^alleged unfairness of the comp?tioiont the Committee may call attention to any special circumstances by reason of which, in their opinion, tho industry In the United Kingdom is placed at a serious relative disadvantage.40.    ng do not find that competition comes from any ootmtry &quot;hose currency operates go as to create any export bounty.     In face the country most complained of
was Switzerland and the Swiss currency has been almost stationery for many years -41.    The only evidence of subsidies, bounties or other artificial advantages submitted to us was a subsidy of six million franca given by the Swiss Government to the Swiss embroidery industry during the past five years.    Owing to the falling off in the demand for embroidery in the piece due to change of fasnion mainly in lingerie, the number of embroidex*y machines in Switzerland was deomed to be too high and manufacturers competed severely for whatever business arose.    It was therefore decided by means of this subsidy to reduce the nmaber of manufacturers by demolishing machinery on the condition that the manufacturers whose machinery was destroyed should agree not to place any more embroidery machinery in their factories.     The number of Schiffli machines in Switzerland has been reduced from 5,349 in 1S19 to 3130 in 1927 and the number of hand-operated machines from 7,959 in 1920 to 3,670 in 1927.42.    We consider that this can be regarded as a subsidy within the meaning of the White Paper as it clearly enables Swiss manufacturers to reduce their liabilities without cost to themselves.    On the other hand, it would also have the effect of reducing competition bet-ween Swiss manufacturers and therefore tend to keep up prices.    We would mention that by virtue of an Order of the Swiss Government, dated 2nd lCarch, 1S2S, this subsidy comes to an end cn June 30th, 1926.43.    Evidence was giver, by both sides as to the wages and&apos;hours worked in several Continental countries, but it was conflicting in several respects.   It was proved that in seme cases the minimum rates were lower abroad than in Northern Ireland, but it was admitted even by the Applicants
that actual wages paid, both here and abroad, were frequently ebcre the minimum rates.     We feel that the quotation here cf minimum rates paid in Northern Ireland compared with those in Swit2erlend or Belgium, or indeed any foreign country, must be misleading and we can only draw our inforonce on the general trend of the evidence.       We have arrive---1, at the conclusion that with reppee-t.-to, the countries from which the bulk of the imports are obtain;nod it cannot,be r.s? ft that, cither the conditions of labour as regards remuneration cr hours ci employment are inferi or to those obteinirg in northern Ire.le.nd Certain types of goods come from Japan and Madeira and with regard to these countries our conclusions are different but v/e do not consider that the articles from these countries are truly representative of the bulk of the imports or form any large part of such imports. (6) Whether the auplioant industry Is beins carried on in the United Kingdom with reasonable efficienoy and economy.44.    This heading calls for little comment from us.   It was generally agreed by the Opponents that in the type of goods in which Northern Ireland specialises they are pre-eminent and the evidence generally confirmed this. .     We&quot; therefore find that the applicant industry is being carried on with reasonable efficiency and economy. (7) whether the imposition of a duty cn ^oods of the class or description in Question would eyert a seriously adverse effect on employment in any other jugustrg, bein^c en industry using goods of that cless or &amp;.?sorJp-tion in production.45.    It cannot strictly be said that any of the goods with which we are conoerned in this enquiry can be termed goods &quot;used in production&quot;.   We feel, however, that we should state in this connection that if a duty were imposed it might have serious effects on our export trade,-31-
both of materials in tho piece and nade-up goods. Many countries., such as Switzerland and Madeira, obtain thoir cotton and linen piece goods from this country and this trade might tend to be diverted if the dutyvjero imposed on tho finished product. Further,  it is already tho practice of many Eritish manufacturers to send goods, such as handkerchiefs, to Switzerland to be embroidered. These are then returned to the United uingdom where they are hemstitched, if necessary, laundered, foldea, boxed, &amp;c.    fhis trade would suffer if the cuty were Imposed, as although the applicants maintained that they would be able to produce all the goods now imported, we must point out that they do not possess Schiffli machines so that it  this type of embroidery continues in demand it is reasonable to suppose that these socds would still come in and tho only effect of the duty would bo to raise the price to the consumer.   Another point which ariBOB is that noveltyi3 the life-blood of this industry and that ths opponents maintained that by the importation of novelties the sale of Eritish rroods is stimulated. The main point here is that the variety of goods in this trade is enormous and that British and foreign goods are included in the ranges of most wholesale houses. If a new type of article or new design is created then British and x&apos;oreign manufacturers tend to copy one another in the production of the new or &quot;novel&quot; goods.(8) Whether, having rot-j;ard to the above conditions,  theapplicant industry has,_in the opinion of uhe Committee,established a claim to a duty; and,  if so, what rate or rates of dutyt in tha opinion of the Committee, would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair corn-petition. 46. Having regard to our conclusions under headings (2) to (d), we are unanimously of opinion that the Applicants have not established a claim to a duty.47.     In conclusion, it is with pleasure we express our warm appreciation of the valuable sorvioes rendered to ub by our Secretary, Mr. B.E.J. Brady, M.B.E.
