(TiilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.)In my capacity of Commissioner cf Crown Lands I wish to place before my colleagues certain considerations with regard to the Memorandum (CP. 141)  circulated by the First Commissioner of Vorks on the proposed abolition of Private Enclosures in the Royal Parks.The Commissioners of Crown Lands are in no sense hostile to the general principle embodied in Lord Peel&apos;s Memorandum as to the desirability on general grounds of adding to the space available for the use of the general public in the Royal Parks in and around London. But theCommissioners are in the position of trustees and willing as they are to do all that is possible to improve the recreational facilities of the population they are bound by their trusts to see that the Land Revenues of the Crown do not suffer any avoidable diminution.The legal position is as follows:-     The Cro.vn Lands Act 1629, Sections 25 and 34 provided that the powers of selling and leasing Crown Lands thereby conferred on the Commissioners of Woods - (and no other powers existed) -should not extend to any lands being part or parcel of the Royal Forests, Parks or Chases in England.In 1852 the Office of Vorks and the office of &quot;&apos;oods were united (Crown Lands Act, 1332);    but by the Crown Lands Act, 1851, they were separated again;    and most of theCP. 147 ( 28).CABINET.Private Enclosures in Royal Parks.Memo ran disn by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.
o u uRoyal Parks, including Regent&apos;s Park, were by Section 22 placed under the management of the Office of Vorks with those duties and powers of management which would have been exercisable by the V/oods and the i/orks if that Act had not been passed;    so that the restrictions upon selling and leasing remained in force.By Section 23, however, the houses, gardens and portions of ground in the parks then leased or agreed to be leased were reserved to the management of the Commissioners of Woods with the power to grant leases of them. So it comes topass that the enclosures mentioned in paragraph 2 of CP. 141 are under the management of the Commissioners of Crown Lands (formerly Commissioners of Woods). The powers of leasinggiven by the Act of 1829 are now repealed and replaced by the Crown Lands Act 1927, by Section 23 of which the provisions of the Act as to leasing are expressly extended to the &quot;houses, gardens, and portions of ground&quot; to which the Commissioners1 powers of leasing extended immediately before the Act was passed;    that is to say,  among other things,  to these enclosures.The powers of the Commissioners of Crown Lands to grant leases are now governed by the Crown Lands Act, 1927, Section 5 (1), which requires them to obtain the best rent that in their opinion can reasonably be obtained.     This puts the Commissioners of Crown Lands under an obligation to act judicially in obtaining a proper rent and nothing less than an Act of Parliament can relieve them of that obligation. The Commissioners of Crown Lands, in order to comply with the Statutes which govern these actions, must therefore obtain a fair market rent for St. John&apos;s Lodge and any other enclosures to which it is desired that the public should have access.     In fixing the rent regard must be had to what a private person would be willing to pay for the property-2-
though not necessarily to the actual sum that Mr. Somervllle had agreed to give, which may be more than others would be prepared to offer,  though it is an indication of the present value of the property in tho open market.In considering what is a fair rent for the property it must be borne in mind that Mr. Somerville was not only prepared to pay  1,940 per annum as rent but in addition to spend the sum of  5C,C0C on improving the property in return for a 50 years1 lease.    It must also be understood that should the First Commissioner of Vorks be prepared to take a lease of the property at a fair rent the Commissioners of Crown Lands could not consent to any alteration being made In the existing boundaries of the property by the removal of fences, etc.I think I should also mention that the Commissioners of Crown Lands could not contemplate divorcing the grounds of St. John&apos;s Lodge and similar property from the actual residence as this would probably leave the Commissioners with an almost unletable property on their hands.I would remind my colleagues that the Crown Lands are still constitutionally the hereditary property of the Sovereign and the revenues derived from them are only surrendered at the commencement of each reign in exchange for the Civil List, so that It is not merely a question of inter-departmental book-keeping which is at stake.If the &apos;Cabinet approve the general principle, I suggest that what is a fair market rent should be decided by the Chief Valuer of the Inland Revenue, and I understand this course would be agreeable to the First Commissioner of Works.In addition to the annual rent it will be necessary for a sum of money to be paid to Mr. Somerville as ex gratia compensation for the loss of his contract.    At the present moment it is Impossible to say what a fair sum would be, but it is anticipated that it will be somewhere in the neighbour-hood of  3,000.(Intld.)
