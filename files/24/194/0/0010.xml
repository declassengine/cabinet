Niemeyer on League loans which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been good enough to obtain for me.A foreign Office. March 29. 192S.THE SPHERE OF THE LEAGUE FINANCIAL COMMITTEE.1. I cannot express an official opinion on this subject as I have had no opportunity of formal discussion with my colleagues, and I am therefore not authorised to speak in their name. The rest of this note must, therefore, be taken as my personal view based on seven years&apos; membership of the Committee and many informal talks with individual members of the Committee. But I am confident that a formal discussion with my colleagues would, in fact, result in very much the views which I venture to express.2. The central point of League financial action has throughout been the general financial reconstruction of a country, both budgetary and monetary. This follows from the fact that the League Financial Committee arose out of the proceedings of the Brussels Conference. The Committee&apos;s guiding thought has been the fundamental financial reconstruction of a country where that country, for either internal or external reasons, has not been in a position to carry through such reconstruction unaided. As a rule, it has also been the case that the absence of such reconstruction was likely to lead to convulsions which would ultimately endanger European peace. These conditions were pre-eminently present in the case of Austria and in the case of Hungary. They were also present in the cases of Greece and Bulgaria. In the cases of Greece and Bulgaria the Refugee problem, with which the League started, was so large an element in the public finance of those countries, that it threatened to destroy financial stability. In both cases the Financial Committee took up the Refugee problem for that reason, and in both cases, at a further stage, a general financial reconstruction, including currency and the public budget, has followed. The case of Portugal, now before the League, is entirely of the same nature.3. The one. possible exception to the above general rules was the small Municipal Loan for Danzig. The Finance Committee undertook that case, which wTas otherwise rather outside its sphere, because under the Treaty the Free City of Danzig is particularly under the protection of the League.4. The Financial Committee have, on more than one occasion, expressed their hesitation in involving the League in loans solely for purposes of development. Several members of the Committee, in fact, expressed such doubts in the earlier stages of the Bulgarian question, and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has in the past expressed to the Council similar doubts. The objections to League patronage of purely development loans are obvious. Such loans should be capable of standing on their own economic merits. If the League begins to give its support to develop-ment loans, it will be increasingly difficult for minor countries which desire to raise such loans to do so without the League support in all cases, for the market is thoroughly aware of the advantage to issuing houses of shuffling off on to the League 4374   [17454]
their moral responsibilities to lenders. From the point of view of the League, development loans involve many difficulties. They are much more difficult to control than ordinary budget loans, and they are nearly always mixed up with international rivalries among industrial firms seeking orders. They present no special technical problems with regard to currency or public finance on which League experience is useful. On the contrary, their problems are entirely those which the ordinary issuing houses should be capable of dealing with themselves. Finally, while there are limits to the number of countries which require financial reconstruction, there are no limits to the countries which desire development, and consequently an unlimited field of contentious activity would open up before the League.5. M. Briand. at the Meeting of the Council in March, was entirely misinformed in thinking that the League financial action had been chiefly concerned with humanitarian projects. But the fact that he raised a question with regard to the scope of the activities of the Financial Committee makes it extremely undesirable that so novel a precedent as that involved in the Zionist application should at this moment be encouraged.G. In these circumstances (and quite apart from any examination of the merits of the scheme or the need for League support to enable the Zionist movement, with an income of  700.000. to borrow  2,000,000), I am strongly of the opinion that both the Financial Committee and the Council of the League would find great difficulty in regarding the Zionist case as a proper subject for their intervention.7. I may add that the League have never dealt with any loan application except in the form of a loan raised by, and on the application of, the responsible Government of the country concerned. It would be an entirely new, and, in my belief, an undesirable departure for the League to deal with a private body not itself a Government. The Greek Refugee Commission, a body set up by the League itself, has no powers for borrowing and has never borrowed under the auspices of the League. The loans from which they have benefited have been raised by the Greek Government itself and have always been presented to the League by the Greek Government as part of the general Greek financial problem.O. E. NIEMEYER.March 29, 1928.
