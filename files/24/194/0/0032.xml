2 E T 0 A E I 3 S T.132(28)REVISED-DRAFT TREATY OF ARBITRATION WITH T2IE united STATES OF ALiERICA.lienorandun by t)le Home Secretary.I sriew with some uneasiness the proposal to replace the Convention of the 4th April, 1908, known as the Root-Bryce Treaty, toy a new treaty of arbitration on the lines of the draft submitted by the United States: and after giving the matter most careful and anxious consideration I do not feel satisfied that the revised draft prepared by the Foreign Office removes the risks which appear ^-o be involved in concluding such a treaty.It seems to be impossible to estimate the consequence of omitting from the proposed nor; treaty the provision which appears in Article I of the Rcot-Bryce Treaty excluding from arbitration &quot;difTerences&quot; which affect &quot;tl.e vital interest, independence or the honour&quot; of the contracting States.    The absence of any genera?, reservation of this kind to cover future contingencies the nature of which cannot be foreseen is of special significance in the case of a treaty v;ith the United States, in view of the over-riding jurisdiction and control of the Senate in regard to the treaty making powers of the Executive - a control which, as the Foreign Secretary has pointed out,  is likely to be freely exercised in connection with the &quot;special agreement&quot; which is required before any dispute can be submitted to arbitration.    It 5.s difficult to feel satisfied that for present purposes the position of our own Executive in relation to Parliament, will be assimilated to that of the United States Executive in relation to the Senate by the words proposed in the second paragraph of Article ?. of the Foreign Office draft (&quot;the special agreement shall toe made on the part of His majesty the King in accordanceis document is tho property of Kio Britannic iia&apos;jostyf8 Government.
6c, with the constitutional laws of the part of this realm which may be concerned&quot;).    I should be disposed to suggest that the only v;ay to equalise our position with that of the United States would be t-c make these special agreements expressly subject to the ratification or approval of Parliament.    It must he recognised that this would involve sons alteration of the existing constitutional practice in regard to the exercise of the King18 prerogative power to conclude treaties and that the change might be regarded by the United Stater, &apos;J;-ov ernuent as a discrimination against themselves.   The point however demands very careful c consideration derati on.fhe scope of the special reservations set out, in Article Z of the Foreign Office draft is not very clear.    In the Foreign Office draft the words &quot;recognised by international lav; to be within zhe domestic jurisdiction of either of the parties&quot; are substituted for &quot;domestic jurisdiction&quot; simply.    I understand that there has been a good deal of discussion among International lawyers ivhou1, the precise meaning attributed by international lav.&apos; to the phrase &quot;domestic jurisdiction&quot;.    It seems desirable that we should be advised mor*e exactly as to the effect of the reservation.    Should we be protected, by the use of the phrase, from any obligation to submit to arbitration matters which are o? domestic concern to the British Empire as a whole or any part of the E&apos;&quot;Dire so lonp; as the matter is one to whioh no recognised rule of international law applies?Further, as regards the provision in Article 3 (o&apos;j  of the Foreign Office draft, whioh removes from arbitration any matter which arises out of the maintenance of the traditional attitude of cither of the high contracting parties, in relation to particular parts of the world where it possesses special interests .?hich are known to the other party, it is to bo hoped that this is sufficiently wide to cover all matters arising out of our interests in Egypt and any other country in whioh v/e can be said to have special interests.
I should like to be nore fully assured that disputes as to our belligerent rights at sea would not fail v/ithin the scope of Article 2 and that such disputes could not, in the words of the Foreign Office draft &quot;be agreed to be justiciable in their nature by reason of being susceptible of decision by the application of a recognised rule of international lav;&quot; .The gist of the natter, as it appears to ne, is (l) that the proposed treaty though reciprocal in form is not reciprocal in effect and the proposal that the special agreements &apos;:o arbitrate shall be made in accordance with our constitutional laws v/ould not establish, complete reciprocity;   (2) any provision which would equalize the position by making the special agreements to arbitrat expressly subject to ratification by the Parliament of that part of the Empire which is concerned would be open to the objection that it would involve an alteration of existing Constitutional practice.    (3) the absence of any provision excluding matters affecting the vital interest of the state differentiates the new proposals from the existing Treaty, and this in itself emphasizes the danger inherent in the want of complete reciprocity.Y7.J.H.23rd April, 1928.
