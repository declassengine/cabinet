Paper No. 312-C.)(Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 229th Meeting, Minutes 3 and 4.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration an Interim Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 312-C).SIR HUGH TRENCHARD explained the recommendations of the Committee enumerated in paragraph 7 of the Chiefs of Staff Report, and mentioned that the Report of General Gillman&apos;s Sub-Committee, which had been completed, would be considered by the Chiefs of Staff on Monday next.Mr. BRIDGEMAN said that the Admiralty had prepared a revised programme for the naval defences, which would be submitted to the Chiefs of Staff at the same time.GENERAL CHARLES said that early approval of the revised proposals for the fixed defences was urgently required, as the construction programme was being held up.SIR MAURICE HAN KEY suggested that the Gillman Sub-Committee^ Report, which was to be considered by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on Monday, should then be referred direct to the Cabinet on Wednesday next, as it would not be easy to bold another meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence next week.LORD SALISBURY drew attention to the grave situation disclosed regarding the unreliability of assistance required from India for the defence of Singapore. He suggested that it might be well to ask India for an appreciation of the question in order that we might know exactly where we stood. He regarded with consider-able misgiving the dangerous possibilities, as far as Singapore was concerned, of the increased measures of self-government being accorded to India.SIR CLAUD JACOB said he did not consider that the situation was quite so dangerous as Lord Salisbury appealed to think. Personally, he felt sure that whenever His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain urgently required assistance for the defence of Singapore, the necessary troops would he forthcoming.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (i.) To recommend the Cabinet to approve the Interim Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, the conclusions of which are as follows : (a.) That the first stage of the plan of defence of Singapore, as approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet (215th and 218th Meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence), including[17456b]MM
provision for three 15-inch guns, should be proceeded with, subject to such modifications in detail as may be adopted as the result of the enquiry now being conducted by General Gillman&apos;s Sub-Committee. This will not result in any economy during the financial year 1928--29.(6.) That the time originally allowed (3 years) for the completion of the first stage of tlie plan of gun defences should be prolonged by 2 years, i.c., to the end of the financial year 1932-33.(c.) That in considering the first stage of the programme, General-Gillman&apos;s Committee should assume that there is no alteration in the scale of attack as hitherto laid down; with the exception of attack by Coastal Motor Boats, which, we are agreed, need not be considered in present circumstances.(d.) That consideration of the later stages of the plan of defence, which include, the western defences, should be postponed for the present, since both the scale of attack and the scale of defence will be affected by the assumptions to be made on certain matters on which it may be possible to express more definite opinions a year or two hence, such as the presence or absence of battle cruisers on the China Station; detailed plans for mine fields; the strength of the Air Forces to be based on Singapore; the degree of reliance to be placed on reinforcements from India: and other possible developments.(C.I.D. Paper No. 312-C.)(ii.) To invite Field-Marshal Sir Claud Jacob, after communication with India, to report as to the degree of reliance which could be placed on the prompt despatch of Indian reinforcements to Singapore.******2.

Copy No.    99312-C.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 127.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.SINGAPORE. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 306-C.)Scale of Attack and Scale of Defence.Interim Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.1. BY direction of the Prime Minister (see Appendix) the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee have recently had under review the question of the scales of attack and scales of defence of the Naval Base at Singapore.We have undertaken this examination with a view to producing revised plans on the most economical scale possible compatible with the objects to be attained. Our intention, as expressed in our earlier Reports, is unchanged in that as soon as financial considerations permit Singapore should be equipped with defences on a scale unmistakably sufficient to deter attack. (Review of Imperial Defence, 1926 (C.I.D. 701-B, para. 17).)One of the objects of our present investigation was to ascertain whether the scale of defence hitherto accepted as an adequate deterrent had sufficiently taken account of the share which the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force could take in the defence of Singapore.To assist us in this review we set up an inter-departmental Committee, under the Chairmanship of General Sir Webb Gillnian, the Master-General of the Ordnance, to consider &quot;whether the defences as at present arranged for are not in excess of requirements.&quot;At the same time we ourselves undertook a further examination of the scale and the likelihood of a Japanese attack on Singapore in the light of the deterrent effect to be expected from the presence of British naval and air units in Far Eastern waters, and it is with this aspect of the question that this Interim Report deals.2. When we began our enquiry we were under the impression that it was the intention of the Admiralty to augment the Fleet in China by battle cruisers as soon as Singapore was capable of acting as a base, that is to say, within the next year or two. When, at a secret meeting of the Imperial Conference in October, 1923, Admiral of the Fleet Earl Beatty stated this intention, he was careful to add &quot;if the political situation justified it.&quot; In view of the advice as to the political situation in the Far East given to the Committee of Imperial Defence by the Foreign Office, the Chief of the Naval Staff informs us that there is no present intention on the part of the Admiralty to make this addition to the China Fleet. Sir Charles Madden adds, however, that in the event of a deterioration in the International situation in the Far East which might conceivably lead to strained relations or war, and if the general naval situation justified such a course, he would advise the Admiralty to revert to their original intention.Though the role of battle cruisers before the arrival of the main Fleet would be a difficult one, the presence of these fast ships and of an additional aircraft carrier, which, it is understood, would accompany them, would be an important factor from the enemy&apos;s point of view in considering the deterrents to an attack on Singapore. [17323]
If their presence on the China Station could be relied on, therefore, the battle cruisers would be an important factor in considering the defence of Singapore.3. A new factor in the situation is the probability that within the next few years aircraft will be based at Singapore. It is understood that before long one flight of Flying Boats, probably capable of carrying torpedoes, will in any case be located there. In addition, aerodromes and accommodation for air units are now being made, and it may well be possible in four or five years&apos; time to arrange for a squadron of aircraft to be permanently stationed at Singapore. The Sub-Committee have, in fact, been assured by the Chief of the Air Staff that if the international situation changed and war with Japan became at all likely, he would not hesitate to press for one or two squadrons (additional to the Flying Boats) to be moved to Singapore. The presence of aircraft on the China Station (whether forming part of the local defences of Singapore or not) would provide an additional deterrent to attack, and would have to be taken into consideration in connection with the scale of defence.4. Continuous investigations, pursued during the last few years both at Singapore and at home, tend to confirm the opinion expressed by the Oversea Defence Committee in 1924 &quot;that a hostile landing on the mainland of Johore, with the object of an attack on Singapore Island from that direction, would, owing to the difficulties of the terrain to be traversed and various other factors, be an operation of so difficult a nature, that the probability of an enemy attempting it on a large scale may be excluded&quot; (C.I.D. Paper 237-C, paragraph 5). We regard a bombardment of the naval base and its resources, and the landing of raiding parties on Singapore Island, as the most likely form of attack.5. One disquieting new factor in the situation is the growing doubt as to whether reinforcements from India for the garrison of Singapore are likely to be available on or just before the outbreak of war. The reinforcement, on the outbreak of war, of the garrison of a defended port is contrary to a long established principle, and this expedient is adopted in the case of Singapore only because, for both financial and climatic reasons, it was considered impossible in time of peace to maintain the garrison of Singapore at war strength. The development of self-governing institu-tions in India within the last few years now makes less safe than formerly the assumption that in an emergency troops can be counted on for imperial purposes outside India. Moreover, it is by no means unlikely that the same political and military situation which necessitates the strengthening of the garrison of Singapore may have reactionswithin India or on its borders which would make the Government itself, apart from the legislature, reluctant to allow the despatch of reinforcements to Singapore.&quot; 6. Several of the factors discussed above are likely to affect the scale of attack and scale of defence at Singapore. On most of them it may be possible to form a better judgment in a few years&apos; time. At present the burden of the sedentary defence of the fortress of Singajjore falls heavily on the War Office, the more so as it comes at a time when continuous pressure for economy coincides with developments in weapons which call for expenditure on the mechanisation of the mobile forces. We are agreed that the first stage of the Singapore Defences should be proceeded with on present lines, but we recognise the desirability of taking advantage of any opportunity which may arise from any re-distribution of the Fleet or the Air Forces, or from other causes, to alleviate the burden on War Office funds. The latter we suggest might be effected to some extent by prolonging the period at present allotted for completing the first stage of the defences. No reduction in expenditure already arranged for 1928-29 will, however, be possible.7. Bearing the above considerations in mind, we make the following recommendations : (a.) That the first stage of the plan of defence of Singapore, as approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet (215th and 218th Meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence), including provision for three 15-inch guns, should be proceeded with, subject to such modifica-tions in detail as may be adopted as the result of the enquiry now being conducted by General Gillman&apos;s Sub-Committee. This will not result in any economy during the financial year 1928-29.
CHAS. E. MADDEN, A.F. G. F. MILNE, C.I.G.S.2. Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. March 7, 1928.Appendix.(C.O.S. 14.)SINGAPORE. The Defences and Development of the Naval Base. (Note by the Secretary.)Two papers have recently been circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence which suggest that the scale of expenditure on the Singapore base might with advantage be reconsidered. The Admiralty say (C.I.D. Paper No. 306-C), that it is now clear that the base could not economically be completed before July 1937, while the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (C.I.D. Paper No. 304^C) wonders whether the scale of military defence approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence is not unnecessarily lavish to meet even the accepted scale of attack, and further thinks that this scale of defence ignores the assistance which might justly be expected from the other two fighting Services.The Prime Minister, therefore, directs, as a preliminary to further meetings of the Singapore Sub-Committee, that the three fighting Departments should at once consult together and produce revised plans on the most economical scale compatible with the objects to be attained, and that, with their proposals, they should present an estimate of the expenditure in each year up to 1937 on the same basis as the estimate int.) s.b. presented a year ago in C.I.D. Paper No. 2s2-C.18/11/27.The Prime Minister has directed that this reference should be considered by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in the first instance.(Signed) NORMAN LESLIE,(For the Secretary).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 21, 1927.c 3(b.)

CP. 113 (28) and C.1.1). 315-C.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.SINGAPORE. SCALE OF ATTACK AND SCALE OF DEFENCES.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.WITH reference to our Interim Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 312-C) and to the Conclusions of the Committee of &quot;Imperial Defence to Item (2) at their 234th Meeting, held on the 29th March. 1928, we have considered the attached Report by Lieutenant-General Sir Webb Gillman&apos;s Sub-Committee, and recommend that approval should be given to the revised programme for installation of the defences given in paragraph 12.2. We venture to draw attention to the desirability of this approval being accorded as early as possible, since the programme of work for the present year cannot be proceeded with until it is obtained.3. With reference to paragraph 16 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, arrange-ments have already been made for exercises at Portsmouth and Malta during the present year with a view to ascertaining the capabilities of ships and shore defences under present-day conditions.4.   The objects of the exercise at Portsmouth are: (a.) To demonstrate that by the use of smoke a squadron can reach a suitable position from which to carry out an area bombardment (e.g.. the dock-yard), and remain there under cover of smoke for half an hour.(b.) That during this period the shore observation posts will be rendered of no value to the coast defences by the smoke screen, and that the only feasible method of control will be by air observation.(Note. A shoot by the coast defences at a battle practice target behind a smoke-screen has been included at Portsmouth at the request of the War Office.)5. The exercise at Malta is mainly concerned with actual results, and the objects are as follows : (a-.) To give the coast defences experience in firing at &quot; Centurion&quot; in realistic conditions and to see what results can be achieved against a ship free to manoeuvre.(6.) To give the fleet experience in bombarding with indirect laying and training&apos; as well as air observation under realistic conditions of alteration of course and to ascertain what results can be achieved against a 15-inch gun emplacement at long range.(Signed) H.

To recommend that approval should be given to the proposals of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that the installation of A/C.M.B. equip-ments at Singapore should not be proceeded with.(b.) That, in view of the recent report of the Gillman Commission, a sub-committee of senior officers of the three Services, under the chairmanship of the Master-General of the Ordnance, should be set up to make recommendations whether the defences as at present arranged for are not in excess of requirements.(c.) That prior to the meeting of the sub-committee referred to above, the Admiralty will reinvestigate the assessed scale of attack to ascertain that full account has been taken of the difficulties confronting an enemy who may wish to destroy the naval base at Singapore.&quot;2. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, at their 64th Meeting on the 23rd January, 1928, agreed: &quot; That the Sub-Committee appointed under the Chairmanship of Lieut.-General Sir Webb Gillman should assemble forthwith to consider the defences (of Singapore) in accordance with Conclusion (b) in the minutes of the 62nd Meeting, using the Memorandum by the Naval Staff (Paper No. C.O.S./119) as the basis for the scale of attack to be anticipated.&quot;3. In accordance with these instructions, we began an examination of the defences with a view to making recommendations as to whether they were not, as at[17-17 I j b 2
present arranged, in excess of requirements. Before, however, we had made much progress, the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee again considered the defence of Singapore at their 66th Meeting on the 1st March, 1928, and agreed to submit the following recommendations to the Committee of Imperial Defence (CCS. Paper No. 127):-&quot; (a.) That the first stage of the plan of defence of Singapore, as approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet (215th and 218th Meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence), including provision for three 15-inch guns, should be proceeded with, subject to such modifications in detail as may be adopted as the result of the enquiry now being conducted by General Gilhnan&apos;s Sub-Committee. This will not result in any economy during the financial year 1928-29.(&amp;.) That the time originally allowed (3 years) for the completion of the first stage of the plan of gun defences should be prolonged by 2 years, i.e., to the end of the financial year 1932-33.(c.) That in considering the first stage of the programme, General Gillman&apos;s Committee should assume that there is no alteration in the scale of attack as hitherto laid down; with the exception of attack by Coastal Motor Boats, which, we are agreed, need not be considered in present circumstances.(rf.) That consideration of the later stages of the plan of defence, which include the western defences, should be postponed for the present, since both the scale of attack and the scale of defence will be affected by the assumptions to be made on certain matters on which it may be possible to express more definite opinions a year or two hence, such as the presence or absence of battle cruisers on the China Station; detailed plans for mine-fields; the strength of the Air Forces to be based on Singapore; the degree of reliance to be placed on reinforcements from India; and other possible developments.&quot;4. These decisions have necessarily modified our original Terms of Reference, and we assume that we are now merely required to submit recommendations with regard to the first stage of the programme of fixed defences, and with regard to any aspects of the defence that might with advantage be investigated before the time arrives for the second stage to be decided upon.The Present Approved Programme for the First Stage of Defence.5. The Committee of Imperial Defence, at their 215th Meeting, agreed that the &quot;first stage of the plan of defence&quot; should include provision for mounting 3 15-inch guns. They also approved the proposals of the War Office for amending the medium and light armament so that the scale would be as follows : 9-2-inch     ... ... ... ...         ... 66-inch        ... ... ... ...         ... 14Anti-C.M.B. ... ... ...... 8Anti-aircraft guns ... ... ...         ... 24Lights       ... ... ... ...         ... 166. The proportion of the medium and light armament to be included in the first stage was decided by the War Office (without further reference to the Committee of Imperial Defence), and the following programme was adopted : Armament. Year.4-6-inch, 15D, Conversion to B.L., Blakang Mati ...      1927*2-6-inch, 15D, Pulau Ubin ... ... ... ...      192S2-6-inch, 750, Pulau Tekong (Besar)... ... ... ) 19292 9-2-inch, Blakang Mati (Conversion)       ... ... )2-9-2-inch. Penggerang   ... ... ... ...      19307.   It was also proposed that the 15-inch guns should be installed as follows : I 19301 15-inch at Bee Hoe ... 1 15-inch at Mati Ikan1-15-inch at Blakang Mati    ... ... ...      1931This work should bo completed at the end of the present financial your.
Recommendations of the Gil/man Commission,8. The above programme was in the hands of the Gillman Commission before they visited the area last year, and in their Report the following were the principal alterations recommended : (i.) The retention of Penggerang Hill as an Observation Post only, (ii.) The transference of the guns at Penggerang to Pulau Tekong (Besar). (Iii.) No guns to be placed on Tekong Kechil.(iv.) The Tekong Kechil guns to he placed on Pulau Ubin, and the 6-inch (15?)guns at Pulau Ubin to be moved to the Changi area, (v.) Certain alterations in siting the lights.Suggested Alterations in First Stage.9. Now that the Admiralty are proposing to block the Calder Passage, we agree that it is unnecessary to have any 6-inch guns and lights at Penggerang. In our opinion the Eastern defences would also not be weakened by placing the 2-9-2-inch guns at Pulau Tekong instead of at Penggerang. In addition, the withdrawal to Tekong will render the guns less liable to a surprise land attack, the number of troops required for land defence will be less, supply difficulties will be diminished, while the amenities of life and the health of the garrison are likely to be better ii troops are concentrated rather than scattered in this uninviting area.At the same time, we consider that an observation post should be retained at Penggerang, as it might be possible from this site to observe behind the smoke-screen that the Japanese Fleet would probably put clown when bombarding.We are agreed that no advantage is gained by placing the 2 6-inch (75Q) guns as originally proposed on Tekong Kechn, and we recommend that they should be located instead on Pulau Ubin. and that 2 6-inch (150) guns be installed on the main Singapore Island at Changi Hill.10. As regards the disposition and types of lights at the entrance of the Johore Strait, we are informed that experiments in coast-defence lighting are now being carried out, and while we are agreed that the main object is to bring the lights to bear in the. best possible way on the main channel, we suggest that the War Office should be allowed to decide on the types and disposition of the lights in accordance with the result of these experiments.11. In the present programme for the first stage (paragraph 6) the 2 6-inch guns at Pulau Ubin were to be installed in 1928. Before this can be done, however, it will be necessary &apos;to construct a pier and railway. We therefore recommend that the installation of these guns should be deferred to the second stage, and that the 2 6-inch guns, which we suggest should now be at Changi, should be included instead in the first stage, with the proviso that if the local authorities find it more economical to employ the Changi labour at an earlier date on Pulau Ubin the installa-tion of the guns on that island might be. accelerated.Programme now recommended for first stage. 12.   To sum up (a.) We consider that, since the Calder Passage is now to be blocked, the 2 6-inch guns and 2 lights formerly proposed for Penggerang are no longer necessary.(i.) We endorse the recommendations of the Gillman Commission that Penggerang Hill should be retained as an Observation Post only, that the 2 9-2-inch guns originally proposed for that place should be placed on Pulau Tekong (Besar), and that no guns should be located on Tekong Kechil.(c.) We recommend that 2 6-inch (150) guns should be located at Changi Hill. (d.) We agree that guns and lights, for the defence of the West Strait, per se,are not required, but we recommend that the question of 9-2-inch gunswest of Singapore Town should be considered later (see paragraph 14). (e.) We suggest that the exact types and disposition of the lights for theEastern defences should be left to the War Office to decide when the resultsof experiments now taking place are available.
(/.) We recommend that the revised programme for the first stage of the defences should be as follows : (i.) Coast Defence Guns 2-6-inch, 15G, Changi Hill    ...         ... 19282 9-2-inch, Conversion to 350, BlakangMati     ............ 1929-302-9-2-inch. 35c. Pulau Tekong (Besar) ... 1930-31l-l-j-inch. Bee Hoe......         ... 1928-311-15-inch, Wing Loong        ...         ...   1 0I. QO1-15-inch, Blakang Mati      ...         ...   f &apos;-WJ-*w2-6-inch. 750. Pulau Tekong (Besar)  ... 1932(ii.) Anti-Aircraft Guns  4 per annum.(iii.) Lights To be installed at the discretion of the War Office when theresults of the experiments now being carried out are available.// rth er Reco m m endations.13. We note that the Chiefs of Staff have recommended that no defences should be installed on the West of Singapore Island during the first stage. While we recognise the advantages of this course, we would point out that the result will be that the defences of the Island will be somewhat unbalanced as between the East and West at the end of the first stage.Landing Attack on West, and South-West of Singapore Island.14. AVe understand that the Admiralty hold the opinion that an attack by the Japanese from the West either by bombardment or by landing parties would not present insuperable difficulties from the naval point of view.We therefore recommend that the General Officer Commanding, Malaya, in consultation with the Naval authorities, should be asked to report on the difficulties of a landing attack on the West and South-West of the Island, and on the steps that might be token to deal with it, and that he should also be asked to select a suitable site for the 2 9-2-inch guns formerly destined for Tanjong Gul. From the War Office point of view, it is desirable that these guns should be located as close as possible to the Southern armament, as this would assist towards economy and administration. On the other hand, removal of the guns too far to the East of Tanjong Gul might result in uncovering an area from which long range bombardment of the Base would be possible.Use of Mobile Armament at Singapore.15. Although it is obviously impossible to forecast whether the Japanese would attack from the East or the West, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Admiralty, if an attack from the East is decided upon, there would be a possibility of the Japanese, providing they had successfully silenced the Eastern armament by bombardment, attempting to force light craft up the Johore Strait, with a view to bombarding the dockyard at close range. Although this operation would undoubtedly entail heavy loss from mines and possibly unlocated 6-inch guns, the Admiralty consider it might be preferable to standing in, after the Eastern defences had been dealt with, to bombard the Southern defences, which would have to be overcome before a bombardment of the naval base from the South-East could be effected. The mobile armament (6-inch Howitzers) at Singapore might be of use for meeting such an attack, and we therefore suggest that the General Officer Commanding, Malaya, should also be asked to report on the question.Need for long range bombardment trials of Coast Defences by Capital Ships.16. During our discussions we have endeavoured to arrive at estimates of the probable effect of long range bombardment of coast defences by capital ships, and
vice versd. There is evidently a scarcity of reliable data, and figures produced either Jby the Admiralty or the War Office are obviously open to dispute, We there-fore strongly recommend that, if possible, long range bombardment trials by ships on the move should be arranged during the next vear or two, in order that more information on the subject may be available when tne second stage of the defences is considered.WEBB GILLMAN (Chairman).
