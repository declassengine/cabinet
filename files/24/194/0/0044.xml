[This Document is the Property ot His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 144 (28).IRISH CIVIL SERVANTS.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of a letter which I have addressed to Mr. Blythe after a discussion with the Lord Chancellor.You will no doubt have seen the debate in the House of Lords on Wednesday last on the subject of the transferred civil servants : I enclose a copy of the Official Report for convenience of reference. In view of that debate the difficulties of getting through the House of Lords legislation in the shape contemplated, especially as regards the provision for the appointment of a Statutory Committee without the right of access to the Courts, appear to us so serious that the Lord Chancellor and I would be glad of an opportunity of discussing, as soon as possible, the whole situation personally with you and the Free State Attorney-General before we go any further. Would it be possible for you to come over on Tuesday night, so that we could meet on Wednesday afternoon after our Cabinet here on Wednesday morning &apos;? If Wednesday is impossible for you, I fear that the first day after that we could manage is Saturday.If, as I hope, you can come on Wednesday, I should be very glad if you and the Attorney-General could lunch with me at 1*30 at the House of Commons on that day.L. S. A.Dominions Office, Doicn&apos;nuj Street, April 2S, 1U2S.(Confidential.)April 192S.Ernest Blythe, Esq., T.D.[17591]
