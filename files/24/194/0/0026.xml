C A DINE ?.&apos;POLICY CP HLSJl&apos;.J-3TYr S OOYiiiiiiLl^NT ^JJ^T JJfllTJiIH N&quot; RfigARD &quot;TO 5-if^inTwiRS&amp;SSS AND OJLBLI OOMffi&amp;MOF,.MemoraacS\,ua by the Secretary of State for Scot land, P-b^trman of tho Cor.?grenoe.I,     The Imperial Wireless and Cables Conference has had tho financial aspect of the Merger between tho Eastern Telegraph and Karooni Companies examined and reported upon by two enperts - Sir Ottc Niomsycr and Sir William   ]dcLintock. There is no need for cc to trouble my colleagues with the details of this Report.    It will suffice to say that the experts find that tho proposed capitalisation of tho new merged Company is not unduly excessive except in so far as the  9,000,000 &quot;B&quot; Ordinary shares arc concerned,  which are intended to cover any increased profits which may accruo in future.3.      As my colleagues already know,  in announcing the merger the Companies stated that the agi-agreement was &quot;subject to satisfactory arrangements being made with tho British Government and the Governments of tho Dominions and India&quot;. On inquiry as to tho nature of these &quot;satisfactory arrauge-ments&quot;, the Company enumerated inter alia -  (a) the purchase outright,  on terms to be agreed, of the Beam installations in this country now operated by the Post Office and  (b) tho lease of the paciflo Cablo board&apos;s system and of the Imperial Atlantic Cables.3-. Of tho above (a) - the Beam - is of course an asset of potentially increasing value, while (b) - tho Paoifio Cable and the Imperial Atlantic, Cables - may prove to be assets3 C.PS 126 fas).
2 0.2tho value of wfcioh will dcoreaso with the march of time.If, therefore, any arrangement of this nature wore oonteo-platad, it would be to the advantego of H.lu Governmentto transpose the terms, i.eu to sell (bj and to lease (a)to tho merged Company.     So far as the merged Company isconoernsd there is no reapon to anticipate that they would refuse to consider 3ueh an arrangement.4o      Tho representatives on the Conference of theGovornmentQ of the Dominions and of India are unanimouslyin favour of entering into an arrangement with the mergedCompany, on tho lines indicated above, i0e.,  the salo (ifpossible, and if not the leasing) of the Pacific CableBoard1s system and tho Imperial Atlantic Cables and tholeasing of the General Post Offioe Beam Installations to themerged Company.     They point out, with considerable truth,that it is only in this way that tho following ossontialscan bo securedfi)    A. unified front to competition by foreign undertakings;(ii)    Co-ordination between the various authoritiesengaged in conduoting Imporial communications; andfill)    A completely balanood service; together with the economies which might be reasonably expected to flow from the amalgamation of common services.      Thay hold that, failing some arrangement on these lines, it will not bo possible to dispose on favourable terms of the assets which are likely to prove of decreasing value - i.e.r tho Paoifio and Atlantic Cables, and, what is more important, they point out that, without some suoh arrangement,  the merger between the Eastern Telegraph and Marooni Companies may not in fact materialise, whioh would make the problem of the maintenance of the oable systems still more difficult &quot;tn aolve.     They are of the opinion, and indeed there seems little doubt, that adequate safeguards oould be introduced--
w 0 t)which would preserve the essential features of Government control and eliminate the objections   usually attendant upon a monopoly.5.     Any arrangement of this neturo, of course, involves a departure fr.r. tho policy bithorto pursued by H.1S. Government in Great Britain in regard to the retention of the Beam Services in this oountry &apos;.n Governmental bands.    If my col-leagues deoide to adhere to their original policy, no further progress can be made, and they must bo prepared to face tho breakdown of the conference with its attendant consequences, inoluding the prospect of having to maintain the essential cables with probably no assistance from tho Dominions.    On tho other hand, if my colleagues arc prepared to consider the possibility of leasing the Boam Services in this country to the merged Company, negotiations can proceed on tho understanding that any agreements roached are subject to the approval of tho various Governments concerned.    In this way tho final decision will still remain with the Cabinet, and will not bo given until the full details and implications of the new policy are before them.      The method advocated by tho Genoral Post office  , viz.,  a pooling of receipts - has received little, if any,  support from the Dominion rcpresen-tatives,  and is, in tho opinion of the export advisers to the conference, unlikely to prove acceptable to tho Companies ooncerned.6.      The Conference has already boon sitting for come months, and  some of the representatives are anxious to return home as soon as possible.    I have, therefore, undertaken to communioate to them tho decision of H.M. Government at a meeting which has been provisionally fixed for Thursday afternoon, tho 19th instant.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, J. G*;   17th April,  1928.
