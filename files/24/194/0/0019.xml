(3gpS LXJCUISSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF EIS BRITANNIC I&amp;majesty&apos; S GOWRiqEyTr/&quot; *2SLSECRET.Copy NooCP. 119(28). rC A 3 I N E T.AjBOLiC JION J)PORT EDGAR DESTROYER BASE AND SOUTH QUEEITSFERRY HOSPITAL.Memorandum &quot;by the First Lord of the Admiralty.An Admiralty Committee was appointed to consider how far It Was essential to retain the Destroyer Base at Port Edgar and the Royal Naval Hospital at South iiueensferry, and as a result of the report of this Committee the Admiralty are proposing to close draft &quot;both these establishments.Port Edgar was established during the war in order that the destroyers on return from patrol and operations might have facilities to en&amp;ble them to get essential rest and recreation during the short time they were in harbour.    It has been of much valize since the war hut the recent changes in the dispositions of the Flotillas have reduced the value of this base and it is considered no longer essential to retain It.The Oil Fuel Depot and Oiling Pier at Port Edgar will he retained.On the abolition of South Queensferry Hospital it is the intention that cases requiring medical attention at Rosyth shall be dealt with by certain Hospitals and Nursing Homes in the area.No decision has yet been arrived at as to the ultimate disposal of the properties when they have been closed dewr..The important economies which are anticipated from the closing dov.ii of these two establishments are between  60,000 and  80,000 per annum.The only civilians who may have to be discharged as a result of these arrangements are about a dosen men whose
total pay amounts to about  1,500 a year: the remainder of the Poi-t H&amp;gar and South Queensferry staff are naval ratings.I propose therefore that the necessary orders shall go out by the end of April and the establishments would be closed down by about the end of June, 1923, which would also cause least disturbance to the training of the Destroyer Flotillas.   If however it is considered for any reason preferable to postpone the closing this can be done but it will i2ivoive the continuation of non-essential expenditure of  5,000 per- monthc(Intdu)    W. G. E.ADMIRALTY,  S.V7*1.10th April, 1928.
