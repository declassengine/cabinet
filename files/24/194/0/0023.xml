[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty*s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1928.MOST SECRET. Copy No.    28CP. 123 (28).CABINET.AVOIDANCE OF TAXATION BY RESIDENCE IN THE channel islands.Memorandum by Board of Inland Revenue.(Circulated by direction of the Chancellor of the Excheauer.)I. THE possibilities open to British subjects of avoiding British taxation (income tax. super-tax and death duties) by removing their residence and property out of this country particularly to the Channel Islands were recently brought prominently to public notice by the denth of the late Sir Robert Houston. In his Budget statement of last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that he had &quot; invited the Governments of the Channel Islands to co-operate in preventing the loss of duty in the case of residents in this country who migrate to Jersey or Guernsey.&quot;&apos;2. The measures necessary to check such avoidance involve two things. There must be legislation in this country imposing taxation on British subjects (whose domicile of origin is in this country) who have been resident but have removed with their property out of the country, thus extending the principles upon wrhich liability to taxation has hitherto been based, by deeming the residence or domicile of the tax-payer in this country to continue, after they have in law ceased. Secondly, we must have the co-operation of the Channel Islands authorities in the collection and recovery of the taxes imposed.3. The negotiations with the Channel Islands authorities reached a successful conclusion, and this was announced by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury in reply to a question in the House of Commons on the 21st July, 1927. But those authorities had stipulated in the course of the negotiations that the necessary legis-lation imposing the taxation required should be general in its terms, covering all British Dominions, and not specifically directed to the Channel Islands. A guarantee that this condition would be. observed forms part of an agreement with them.4. Draft legislation (see Appendix A) imposing the taxation required was accordingly prepared with a view to its inclusion in the forthcoming Finance Bill. As originally drafted it provides in general terms for the taxation of British subjects (whose domicile of origin was in this country) who have removed to any &quot;British dominion,&quot; defined as &quot;any of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions outside the United Kingdom.&quot; including Protectorates and Mandated Territories. But this provision is only to be operative as regards any particular &quot; Dominion &quot; if an agreement to that effect has been made with the Government of that &quot;Dominion,&quot; and an Order in Council is made declaring that British subjects are migrating to the &quot; Dominion &quot; with a view to avoiding taxation and reciting the agreement made between the two Governments.5.  To the application of legislation in this form to the self-governing Dominions the Dominions office have raised strong objection.  The grounds of their objection are set out in the Memorandum annexed (Appendix B).   Briefly they amount to this; that it could not fail to be interpreted in the Dominions as the assertion of a right to [17517] b
tax persons within their jurisdiction, and bitterly resented as such, notwithstanding the safeguard that it could only come into operation in a Dominion which had made an agreement to that efYect.(j. Faced with this objection on the one hand, and, on the other hand being bound by our undertaking to the Channel Islands to make the legislation general in its terms, we revised the draft (Appendix C) so as to make it applicable universally to all foreign countries, as well as to the British Empire. In its new form the legislation would enact that if the British Government had leason to believe that its own citizens were removing to any country with a view to avoidance of taxation, then those citizens should lie subject to British taxation, if the Government of the other country agreed to assist in the matter of collection and recovery of the tax. It is not, of course, contemplated that the legislation should be applied to any foreign country, or, indeed, to any part of the Empire other than the Channel Islands, and it cannot be denied that legislation in this form creates an enormous hammer to crack a small nut. But it seemed to us to be the only way by which we could keep our agreement with the Channel Islands, and at the same time meet the apprehension of the Dominions office that the Dominions might allege that a right against them was being improperly claimed by the Mother Country.7. The objections of the Dominions office. however, to the proposals so drafted still remain, inasmuch as they regard them as still open to the criticism that the British Government is claiming the right to tax persons of British origin who are within the jurisdiction of a self-governing Dominion. A copy of their views (Appendix D) on the proposal as drafted in the wider terms is annexed.8. If these objections are to prevail, our agreement with the Channel Islands cannot be carried out. and it would be necessary to reopen negotiations with them in the hope of persuading them to allow us to legislate for them specifically, or, failing that, for the British Empire other than the self-governing Dominions. Such a reopening of negotiations might well lead them to go back on the arrangements and refuse to make any agreement with this country. It must be borne in mind that the Islanders are very tenacious of what they regard as their rights, that there has been considerable agitation in the Channel Islands against the arrangements already made and a very vocal demand for their repudiation, and that the Channel Islands authorities would no doubt resent any proposal to class them with the Crown Colonies rather than with the Dominions.9. However that may be, it hardly seems practicable to secure the consent of the Channel Islands authorities, even if it were forthcoming, to a modification of the arrangements on this line within the period available before the Budget is introduced.APPENDIX A.Part I.Power to charge income tax and legacy and estate duties in case of persona &quot;esiding in -British Dominions in certain circumstances-stanoes.Draft of Clauses to be Inserted in Finance Bill.. (1) Where any British subject is ordinarily resident in any British dominion to which this Part of this Act applies and is a person whose domicile of origin was British and who was ordinarily resident in Great Britain during the greater part of the period of ten years immediately preceding the beginning of the financial year in which he became ordinarily resident in that dominion, then, subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act and of any agreement made thereunder (a) that person shall be assessable and chargeable to British income tax for any year of assessment as if he were domiciled and ordinarily resident in Great Britain and were residing there in that year; and(b) in the event of that person dying domiciled outside Great Britain, theproperty passing on his death shall be chargeable with British estate duty and legacy duty in the same manner and to the same extent as the property so passing would have been chargeable, if he had died domiciled in Great Britain.
(2) If His Majesty in Council is pleased to declare with respect to any British dominion that British subjects are establishing or have established their residence therein and that there is reason to apprehend that a substantial loss of revenue in respect of British income tax and British legacy duty and estate duty will thereby be caused to the Exchequer of the United Kingdom, and that an agreement, as specified in the declaration, has been made for the purpose of this Part of this Act between &quot;the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the dominion, this Part of this Act shall, as from the date of the declaration or such later date as may be specified therein, apply to that dominion.(3) For the purpose of providing relief from double taxation, an agreement made for the purposes of this Part of this Act between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of any British dominion may provide that the amount of any British income tax or British estate duty or legacy duty payable by any person under this Part of this Act shall be reduced by the amount of any corresponding tax or duty payable in that dominion by that person in respect of the income of property in respect of which British income tax or British legacy or estate duty is chargeable under this Part of this Act.(4) Notwithstanding anything in this section, a person ordinarily resident in a British dominion to which this Part of this Act applies shall not be chargeable to British income tax thereunder (a) if he became ordinarily resident in the dominion before the eleventh day ofXovember, nineteen hundred and eighteen;(b) if he has been ordinarily resident in the dominion for a period of not lessthan ten years immediately preceding the year of assessment and has not been ordinarily resident during an)- part of that period in Great Britain; or(c) in any year of assessment in which his total income from all sources.including sources in the dominion, dees not exceed two thousand pounds; or(d) in respect of any income or profits derived from any trade or professioncarried on by him in the dominion and not elsewhere.(5) Notwithstanding anything in this section, no British estate duty or legacy duty shall be chargeable under this Part of this Act in respect of property passing on the death of a deceased person if (a) he became ordinarily resident in the British dominion before the eleventhday of November, nineteen hundred and eighteen; or(b) he had been ordinarily resident in the British dominion for a period of notless than fifteen years immediately preceding the date of his death and had not been ordinarily resident during any part of that period in Great Britain; or(c) the aggregate principal value of all the property wheresoever situate passingon his death does not exceed thirty thousand pounds.(6) Any declaration made by His Majesty in Council under this section shall be laid before the Commons House of Parliament as soon as may be after it is made.(7) If a resolution against any such declaration is passed by the Commons House of Parliament within twenty-one days on which that House has sat next after the declaration is laid before it, or if the agreement specified in the declaration is to continue in force for a specified period only, the declaration shall cease to have effect either on the date on which the resolution is passed or on the expiration of the specified period as the case may be, whichever is the earlier, but in either case without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the declaration or to the making of a new declaration.(8) If, in any case where a person ordinarily resident in a dominion is alleged to be chargeable under this Part of this Act to British income tax or where any property passing on the death of a person ordinarily resident in a British dominion is alleged to be chargeable under this Part of this Act to British legacy duty or estate duty, it is claimed that the person or property is not so chargeable, by reason that the domicile of origin of that person or of the deceased person, as the case may be, was in the dominion and was not British, the question so arising as to the domicile of origin of the person in question shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment relating to British income tax or British legacy &quot;or estate duties, be determined by such court in the dominion (being a court having power to [17517] n 2
Provisions as to assessment and collection of income tax chargeable under this, Part of this Act.Application of enactments relating to legacy duty and estate duty.Supplemental provisions and inter-pretation.determine questions of domicile), as may be specified in the agreement made for the purposes of this Part of this Act with the Government of the dominion, and the decision of that court shall, subject to any right of appeal to His Majesty in Council, be final.. (1) All income chargeable to British income tax under this Part of this Act and not otherwise shall be assessed to tax under the appropriate Schedule by the Special Commissioners and in such place as may be prescribed by regulations made under this Part of this Act.(2) Every person on whom notice is served by the Special Commissioners in manner prescribed by regulations made under this Part of this Act requiring him to make a return of the income in respect of which he is chargeable under this Fart of this Act shall, whether he is or is not so chargeable, make a return in the form and within the time required by the notice :Provided that if under the provisions of the last foregoing section it has been decided by the court of a British dominion that the domicile of origin of any person was in that dominion, that person shall be relieved from the obligation required to make a return under this provision.(3) Tt shall be the duty of every person chargeable to British income tax under this Part of this Act to give notice that he is so chargeable to the Special Commissioners before the thirtieth day of September in the year for which tax is chargeable.(4) If any person without reasonable excuse fails to make any return or to give any notice required by this section, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds, and after judgment has been given for that penalty to a further penalty of the like amount for every day during which the default continues.(5) If any person fails to make a return which he is required by this section to make or the Special Commissioners are not satisfied with any return made under this section, they may make an assessment of tax to the best of their judgment.(6) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, all the provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to persons chargeable with income tax. and to tax assessments, and to appeals against those assessments, and to the collection and recovery, and repayment of tax, and the statement of cases for the opinion of the High Court, including penalty provisions, shall, so far as they are applicable, apply to the charging, assessment, collection, recovery, and repayment of British income tax under this Part of this Act. ami the Special Commissioners shall, for the purpose of assessment, have any of the powers of a surveyor (including powers with respect to additional assessments and surcharges), and for the purpose of the representation of the Crown on any appeal before the Special Commissioners any person nominated in that behalf by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall have the same powers as a surveyor would have at and upon the determination of an appeal relating to income tax.. (1)&quot; Any person who in any British dominion is in such a position with respect to any property that he would under the laws of Great Britain be accountable for any estate or legacy duty chargeable thereon, shall be accountable for any legacy or estate duty chargeable on the property under this Part of this Act.(2) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, all the provisions of any enactment relating to estate duty and legacy duty shall, so far as they are applicable, apply to the accountability for and to the collection, recovery and repayment of estate and legacy duty charged under this Part of this Act..

The Imperial Conference of 1926 declared that &quot; the constitutional practice is that legislation by the Parliament at Westminster applying to a Dominion could only be passed with the consent of the Dominion concerned,&quot; and it may be thought that constitutional proprieties are respected by the provision that the clauses can only be applied with the consent of the Dominion Government. This is. however, not the case. Such a Bill could not properly be introduced without the prior consent of the Dominions generally. To ask for such consent in the present case would be a departure from established practice, which is that the Parliament at Westminster does not legislate, whether directly or by an applying Order-in-Council, for the Dominions even for the purposes of the Dominions themselves wdien the object in view can be attained by* A clause in this form is now clause IS of the Administration of Justice Hill. [17517] B 3
Dominion legislation A fortiori, Parliament should not be asked to pass legislation to operate in Dominions which is intended to serve the local interests of the United Kingdom only.Another outcome of the Imperial Conference was the decision to set up an Expert Committee to consider the &quot;operation of Dominion legislation *&apos; with special reference to the principles embodied in or underlying the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1.8G5, that is to say, in effect the application to the Dominions of existing United. Kingdom legislation extending to them. &quot;Whatever may be the result of the deliberations of the Committee, the decision to appoint it reflects the general desire of the Dominions that the Parliament at Westminster should as far as may be refrain from legislating for them.Even if these general difficulties had not existed there would be a special difficulty attaching to any legislation providing for the levying of United Kingdom taxation on any section of the inhabitants of the Dominions. Parliament renounced the right to pass such legislation for Canada and the West Indies as long ago as 1778. &apos; It was laid down by Parliament (18 Geo. Ill, Cap. XII) that &quot; from and after the passing of this Act the King and Parliament of Great Britain will not impose any Duty, Tax or Assessment whatever, payable in any of His Majesty&apos;s Colonies,Provinces and Plantations in North America or the West Indies.....&quot;   Theprinciple embodied in this Statute has become an essential feature of the Constitutional Law of the Empire.It is true that the Clauses are aimed only at persons with a British Domicile of origin who have recently been ordinarily resident in Great Britain. But the general position is not affected by this limitation. On the contrary, it is an equally well established principle that a British subject of whatever origin, if lawfully resident within a part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, must look equally with the rest of the population to the laws of that part exclusively for a definition both of his rights and of his duties. The conception of a class of &quot; United Kingdom Nationals &quot; which appears to underlie the Clauses has been repudiated by the Home Office in the strongest terms.APPENDIX C.Part 1.Provisions with respect to applica-tion of Part to countries outside United Kingdom.Draft of Clauses to be inserted in Finance Bill.(a) (1) If His Majesty in Council is pleased to declare with respect to any country that British subjects are establishing or have established their residence therein with a view to avoiding liability to British income tax or British estate duty or legacy duty, and that, with a view to preventing the avoidance of such liability and enabling any income tax and death duties which may be charged under this Part of this Act to be collected and recovered, an agreement as specified in the declaration has been made between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the said country, this Part of this Act shall, as from the date of the declaration or such later date, if any, as may be specified in the agreement, apply to that country and have effect accordingly, but subject always to the provisions of the agreement.(2) Any declaration made by His Majesty in Council under this section shall be laid before the Commons House of Parliament as soon as may be after it is made.(3) If a resolution against any such declaration is passed by the Commons House of Parliament within twenty-one days on which that House has sat next after the declaration is laid before it, or if the agreement specified in the declaration is to continue in force for a specified period only, the declaration shall cease to have effect either on the date on which the resolution is passed or on the expiration of the specified period, as the case may be, whichever is the earlier, but in either case without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the declaration or to the making of a new declaration.(4) For the purpose of providing relief from double taxation, an agreement made for the purposes of this Part of this Act between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of any country to which this Part of this Act applies may provide that the amount of any British income tax or British estate duty or legacy duty payable by any person under this Part of this Act shall be reduced by the amount
1 COof any corresponding tax or duty payable in that country by that person in respect of the income or property in respect of which British income tax or British legacy or estate duty is chargeable under this Part of this Act.(b) (1) Where any British subject is ordinarily resident in any country to which Power to this Part of this Act applies and is a person whose domicile of origin was British nlTand&quot;00&quot; and who was ordinarily resident in Great Britain during the greater part of the legacy and period of ten years immediately preceding the beginning of the financial year in which tttaZfot&quot; he became ordinarily resident in that country, then, subject to the provisions of this iicreons Part of this Act and of any agreement made thereunder  JSSirf to(a) that person shall be assessable and chargeable to British income tax for any applies. *year of assessment as if he were domiciled and ordinarily resident in Great Britain and were residing there in that year, and(b) in the event of that person dying domiciled outside Great Britain, theproperty passing on his death shall be chargeable with British estate duty and legacy duty in the same manner and to the same extent as the property so passing would have been chargeable, if he had died domiciled in Great Britain.(2) Notwithstanding anything in this section, a person ordinarily resident in a country to which this Part of this Act applies shall not be chargeable to British income tax thereunder (a) if he became ordinarily resident in that country before the eleventh day ofNovember, nineteen hundred and eighteen.(b) if he has been ordinarily resident in that country for a period of not lessthan ten years immediately preceding the year of assessment and has not been ordinarily resident during any part of that period in Great Britain; or(c) in any year of assessment in which his total income from all sources,including sources in that country, does not exceed two thousand pounds; or(d) in respect of any income or profits derived from any trade or professioncarried on by him in that country and not elsewhere.(3) Notwithstanding anything in this section, no British estate duty or legacy duty shall be chargeable under this Part of this Act in respect of property passing on the death of a deceased person ordinarily resident in a country to which this Part of this Act applies if (a) he became ordinarily resident in that country before the eleventh day ofNovember, nineteen hundred and eighteen; or(b) he had been ordinarily resident in that country for a period of not less thanfifteen years iminediately preceding the date of his death and had not been ordinarily resident during any part of that period in Great Britain; or(c) the aggregate principal value of all the property wheresoever situate passingon his death does not exceed thirty thousand pounds.(c) (1) All income chargeable to British income tax under this Part of this Act Provisions and not otherwise shall be assessed to tax under the appropriate Schedule by the ment^cf8 Special Commissioners and in such place as may be prescribed by regulations made collection of under this Part of this Act.

1 G JL %appendix D.Memorandum hy the Dominions Office.Taa A r,oidaace.I. The main difference between the Clauses as originally drafted is that the word &quot;country&quot; has been substituted throughout for the. words &quot;&quot;British Dominion &quot;&apos; and &quot;&quot; Dominion.&quot; The word &quot; country &quot; is apparently used in the sense of *&apos; place outside the United Kingdom &quot; but it is not defined. It is assumed that no doubt is felt as to its adequately describing each of the Channel Islands. So far as appearances go, the change is an undoubted improvement, but if it is correctly under-stood that the operation of Part I depends on the operation of Part II, the device is rather transparent, seeing that foreign countries do not come within the ambit of Part II.2. It is understood that Part I is as such not intended to have any operation outside the United Kingdom, and this understanding seems to be. confirmed by the omission of the clause providing that questions as to the domicile of origin shall be determined by the Courts of the &quot;dominion.&quot;&apos; This being the case, it is suggested that the phrase *&apos; apply to&quot; passim should be replaced by the words &apos;* apply with respect to &apos;&apos; (cf. the second line of Clause (a) (1)).3. But though Part I may not apply as such outside, the United Kingdom, and though it will have no effect as regards any &quot; country &quot; outside the United Kingdom unless an agreement is made with that country, the clear implication is that the Parliament at Westminster can properly make British subjects ordinarily resident in a self-governing Dominion liable to United Kingdom taxation in their personal capacities as distinguished from their properties situated, or incomes arising, in the United Kingdom. The fact that an agreement with the self-governing Dominion would be necessary before such a result would ensue is not relevant in this connexion. For obviously, a general power to enter into such agreements could not be conferred if it were not proper to offer them to all parts of the Empire.4. Part I operates subject to the provisions of an agreement, but does not by itself provide for reciprocity. It would be. undesirable and unusual to introduce legislation of this general character which did not provide for reciprocity with the self-governing Dominions. The question arises whether substantial reciprocity is in fact provided for, and this gives rise to the question whether in legislation on the lines of Part I Parliament would be legislating extra-territorially. If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, then the Dominion Parliaments could not pass corresponding legislation for people who have come from the dominions to settle here, and it would clearly be undesirable at this juncture to have to explain this legislation as enacted in the exercise of powers not possessed by Dominion Parliaments. If, on the other hand, corresponding legislation is within the powers of the Dominion Parliaments, it would seem that the Canadian Parliament, for example, could in the exercise of its powers to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Canada, pass legislation so as to impose Canadian taxation on Canadians who are ordinarily resident in this country without such limitations as are laid down in Part T (a) (!) as to (i) habitual tax-evasion, and (ii) the necessity for anarising out of or connected with the revenue laws of the United Kingdom a jurisdiction corresponding to that which is by this section conferred on the High Court.(4) In this section the expression &quot;the High Court&apos;&quot; means the High Court in England and the High Court in Northern Ireland, and in the application of this section to Scotland a reference to the Court of Session shall be substituted for the reference to the High Court.((/) In Part II. of the Administration of Justice Act. 1920 (which provides for Eitemuon of the reciprocal enforcement of judgments in the United Kingdom and other parts of Jo^niuf His Majesty&apos;s dominions) the expression &quot;judgment&quot; shall include any judgment Oco. 6 c. si or order given or made by a court in any revenue proceedings, whether a sum of ^&quot;cXg.. money is or is not made payable thereby, and paragraph (f) of subsection (2) of section nine of that Act shall not apply in relation to any such judgment or order.
agreement, and that if reciprocity had previously been established with Canada under Part II, the Courts of this country would have automatically to enforce the Canadian legislation.5. There still remains the fundamental objection that Part I appears to treat those of the British subjects ordinarily resident in a self-governing Dominion who have settled there from the United Kingdom as standing in a different relation to the Parliament at Westminster and the taxation of this country from the rest of the British community. Such a claim could not be put forward unless we are prepared to concede the converse claim to the Dominions. There could be no objection to Parliament following up for the purposes now in view British subjects who leave this country to settle in a foreign country, as there is no competing British jurisdiction to take into account, but as regards the Dominions it is submitted, on general grounds, that it is highly desirable to adhere closely to the principle that a British subject of whatever origin if lawfully established within a part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions must look equally with the rest of the population to the laws of that part exclusively for a definition both of his rights and of his duties.
