(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BlUTAIIiHC MAJESTY1S     -GOVERNMENT)l(2B)) CABINET COPY NO.ROYAL PARKS , PRIVATE ENCLOSURES TO BE GRADUALLY ABOLISHED, Memorandum by tho first Ooimlnnioner of Hia Majonty^ Works, eto.As the Minister i*esponsible for tho Royal parks, I have always had in mind the neoessity, which was also appreciated by my predecessors, not only of resisting encroachment on open spaces, but of adding, wherever possible, to the areas already open to the public.   Thus at Richmond Park about 200 acres of paddock have &quot;been thrown open in the form of golf courses, and in Regent&apos;a Park smaller areas havo boon added from time to time as opportunity offorsd.    The same policy has been followed by the London County Council, who have, sine; the War, acquired 376 acres of land as additions to existing open spaces, while a further P.QP acres have been given or handed over to the Council for similar purposes t20     My attention has been recently directed again to this problem by circumstances which havo arisen in connection with the nurrendor of the lease of st  John&apos;3 Lodge in Regent&apos;a Park, and it is at this particular Park that the policy I have indicated could be pursued over a number of years with appreciable resultsQ    Regent&apos;s Park covers an area of 472 acres: its position is such that it serves an a reoroation Bpaoo for an immonao population which has easy acoenn not merely from the V/est End, but from such crowded looalitieo as St0Panoraa and Camden Town.    It is more central than Kensington Gardens and an oentral as Hyde Park.   Within its area exist a number of enclosuroa whioh are not and indeed never have boon open to tho public. Those are (excluding the Zoological Gardens)Royal

The question on which I ask the views of uy coll-agues is whether they agree with my proposal that, in spite of some ultimate loss of revenue which will be incxirred, and in spite of the cutting short in one case of privileges enjoyed by a Society for many years, a policy shall be pursued of adding to the Park, as opportunity offers, and subject to proper consideration of each case when the time arrives, of the areas (excluding the Zoological Gardens) which are now in private use.4. It would be premature, of course, to expect a decision which should apply Irrevocably to Eedford College, St. Xatherine&apos;s Lodge, or St. Dunstan&apos;s, but it would be valuable to have an indication from the Cabinet as to the general policy to be pursued.5. My concern is, of course, with the amenities of theRoyal Fsrks.     The Commissioners of Crown Lauds and the Treasury, on the other hand, are primarily concerned with the revenue to be derived from the properties.     The former would, I understand, be compelled under the Grown Lands Act of 1927 to charge a fair rent for any areas added to the Park, and while ths Crown Land Revenue would not suffer, the charge would ultimately fall on public funds in the shape of an addition to the Vote for Royal Parks.      It is a question of incurring additional expenditure in the wider interests of tho public, but the sacrifice would not beimmediate
immediate, ae the financial effect a will only mature ae the existing leases expire or are surrendered.   Since the question is one of importance and three Departments are concerned, I have decided, with the concent of the Commissioners of Crown Lands, to plaoe it before the Cabinet.6.     If the policy which I have suggested is approved, the particular case of St- John&apos;9 Lodge (which ie specially important as the building and grounds are in a oentral position on the Inner Circle) will he dealt with In accordance with that approval.    I propose to consider at lefesure what use ia to be made of the house and grounds for the benefit of the public. Without going into detail, I may eay that it was proposed to grant a ne?/ lease of the buildings and grounds to a Mr,, Somerville who had prepared a scheme for converting the residence and stables into flats, and for laying out tennis courts in the grounds, v/ith the Idea&apos; of forming a Sports Club-   The arrangenent-a . for granting the lease had reached an advanced stage when the propriety of the continued use of the property for private purposes was questioned, and in the reasonable expectation of the lease being completed. l&apos;.v. Somerville had incurred a good deal of expense on legal and architectural services..    Though he may have no legal claim on this account, he lias, I understand, been informed that, if the pr*oposed lease to him is finally abandoned, his claim to be recouped expenses incurred on the faith of the provisional agreement will be favourably considered. It might ultimately be found necessary to pay him something, in addition, as compensation for loss of profit- but even If this should unf ortimately be inevitable the total nugatory expenditure involved will be hut small in proportion to the benefits that will accrue to Londoner&quot;s from the general policy, of which the St- John1 a Lodge case is the first instalment, of opening out the whole Park, as far as possible, to public use.6 of Worlcs,Srft May, 1923.
