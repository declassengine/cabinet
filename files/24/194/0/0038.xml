0 A B I N E T.CtJHKITTEB ON POLICY 7Ji BEG-AilD TO CQMPSgi-ICIONHEPORf.1.     At their Meeting of April 18th, 1928,  (Cabinet 21 (26), Conclusion 5) the Cabinet referred to uc for consideration and report the .&quot;emorandun fCoP. 125 (28) ) by the Secretary of State for Scotland as Chairman of the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference in which it wa3 stated that the ropresentatires on the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of the Dominion and Indian Covers-ments were unanimously in favour of entering into an arrangement with the merged Eastern Gslegraph-JIaroonl Company which would include the sale, if possible and if not the leasing, of tho Pacific Cable Board&apos;s system and the Imperial Atlantic Cables and the leasing of the Post Office Beam installations to the merged company.2.     At the Cabinet Meeting reference was made to a Report dealing with the financial aspects of the proposed merger which had been prepared for and submitted to the Wireless Conference by Sir 0-E- Niemoyor and Sir William McLintook,     A oopy of thio Be port is attached hereto-(Appendix I).     In the courso of discussion it has boon pointed out to us by the authors of the Report,  (a) that tho proposed capitalisation of the merger has been arrived      on tho basis of tho present royalty arrangements
and not on the basis of the transfer to the merger of the Post Office Beam installations, (b) that in their opinion the anticipated earnings of the merger in 1928 and the value put by the Cable Companies on their cables, landlines, buildings and ships have both been overstated and (c) that the capital proposed to be allocated to the Marconi Company in the merger exceeds the value of that Company&apos;s assets by a sum of approximately Â£12,000,000. Further reference to this last point is made in paragraph 5 (2) below. Subject to ? considerations and to other criticisms of minor importance the Report is on the whole favourable to the capitalisation arrangements contemplated by the merger.

3. At our request Sir O.E. Niemeyer and Sir W. McLintock consented to examine a pooling scheme (outlined in a Memorandum circulated to the Imperial Wireless Conference by the Post Office (I.W.C. 28 (55), Appendix II ), to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain as to the relative merits of this pooling scheme and of an "all in" merger of British cable and wireless interests and to indicate the nature of the rate control and other essential safeguards which should be insisted upon in the event of the Government reconsidering their decision (Cabinet 9 (28)(2)(1)  ) not to give up to the merger the operational control of the Post Office Beam Services. The views of Sir O.E. Niemeyer and Sir W. McLintock on those points which are fully set out in the annexed Memorandum (B.W.P. (?) (Appendix ?) may be summarised as follows;

(A) For the reasons set out in the opening paragraphs of the Memorandum its authors conclude that it is impossible that a pooling arrangement could be made
in present ciroumstonoes with the companies and that, even if It oould &quot;bo mado, it is difficult to soe how It oould bo a satisfactory substitute from tho public point of view for the united direction and administration whioh would result from an &quot;all in&quot; merger. (B) They represont that oomplote unification of the ownership and oontrol of all imporial Cable and Wireless services will result in more efficient direction of the undertakings and accordingly recommend that the Government should assent to a oomplete merging of the various intorests on the following lines:-fa)   JL fusion of the Cable and Marconi Companios. (b)    Tho morgor then formed to acquire by purohase tho Imperial Atlantic, West Indian and Pacific Cablos. (o)    Tho Beam installations to be leased to the merger for a period of years, fd)   Tho consideration for (c) to bo the payment by the merger to the Governments of a royalty on all communication services arising or terminating in the British Sapire, whether Beam or Cable.In view of possible diversion of traffic from one system to another it would be undesirable to have a royalty based on Beam servioes only.The royaltj- should be fixed at suoh an amount as would oomponsato the Govern-ments for the anticipated profits from the Boam.(e)   The Government to have one special share in the merger Company carrying special voting
rights to provide against possiblo foreign control.(f)    Such a scheme would require to be couoled with yorao form of control of rates.(0)   In order to secure satisfactory and effective control by the Governments concerned of general polioy and cf rates the assent of the Governments to the scheme in (b) above should be conditional on the acceptance by the merger of -(1) An Imperial Advisory Committee nominated by the Governments to a dvise on general policy. (2) No increase of existing rates without the agreement of the above body, with an appeal in the absence of agreement to the Railway and Canal Commission. (5) A substantial percentage of any revenue above a standard revenue from Imperial cormunica-tions to be applied to the reduction of rates on Imperial Services. 4;      It has been represented to us that the British Government are interested in the question in two capacities, firstly as a holder of assets some of which (the Imperial Atlantic, West Indian and Pacific Cables) are likely in the future to become serious liabilities and anovher (the Beam) v;hich has grea.t potential promise and value.      Under the proposed scheme the Government will get rid of Its liabilities and at the same time will make certain of participating in any futxu^e prosperity which the Beam may enjoy.     The scheme is therefore an attractive one from the point of view of the Government as asset holder. In theAeoond place the Government is interested as a Trustee for the public in securing effective control over the general policy of the merger and In particular over the rate charges. The arrangements outlined in paragraph 3 (C) above would, it has been suggested, adequately safeguard tho position in these respects.
5.     A majority cf our Committee consider that in viewof all the circumstances a complete merger on the line.3suggested by Sir O.E. NIemeyer and Sir William UcLintockwill afford the only satisfactory solution of the problem and favour the adoption of the Niemeyor-McLlntook proposalssubject to the following qualifications.The Hone Secretary and the Postmaster&apos;-General dissent from these conclusions(1)   One of the terms suggested by the Eastern-MorccrJ.interests is that the new Company should takeover and work from central offices in London allpresent and future extern;.! telegraph and telephone services of the United Kingdom, bothcable and wireless.     We are informed by thePostmaster-General that Wireless telephony, whichIs still in early stages of development, is a service which can be treated both from the commercial and technical standpoint entirely separately fromwireless telegraphy.      In these circumstances woagree with tho Postmaster-General that it is oftho greatest Importance that the right to determine the future conduct of wireless telephonic services should be reserved to the Government and thatall telephone services, present and future,should therefore be wholly excliided from the merger0and phot.;The nature of facsimile/transmission being more akin to telegraphy than to telephony this service should be treated in the same way as the Beam services and should accordingly be transferred to the merger with those services.
or;(2)   In the event of the Government deciding to transfertheir Cable and Beam interests to tho merger they will inevitably be regarded as in part responsible forthe capitalisation arrangements of this merger,This capitalisation contemplates inter alia theissue of the following shares - , 3..500.,0CO 5?r per cent Cumulative FrcrmTCXiCOshares of  1 eacJi0 21,200,000 7^ per cent Non-Cumulative &quot;A,!Ordinary Shares of  1 eaehB GO&quot; 000 KB&quot; Ordinary Shares of  1 each.No question arises as to the 5-1 per cent FreferenceShares.     Uith regard to the remaining capital the 21,200,000 7-g per cent &quot;A&quot; Ordinary Shares will onlyreceive their full dividend In the event of the netearnings of the me rger reaching at least  2,882,500Poajj,&apos;^whereas Sir C4E, Nismeyer and Sir VTllliam McLintockfutureestimate that the/hot earnings will only amount to  2,500,000 p.a,On the basis of this estimate it will be obvious that there is at present not only a revenue deficiencyas regards the &quot;A&quot; shares, hut no revenue whatever available for payment of dividends on the  9,000,000 RB&apos;: shares, the return on which must therefore be entirely dependent on the power of the mei^ger to earn substantially increased profits in the future-     These shares, which sro to bo allotted in the proportions of 35 per cent to the Cable Companies and 65 per cent to the harconi interests, accordingly represent the speculative element in the amalgamation.     Apart from
the obvious undesirability of the Government being associated v?ith financial arrangements containing an element of so speculative a nature there is the further objection that the holders of these &quot;B&quot;shares will inevitably demand a return on theirdemanfiinvestment, the satisfaction of which/may involve at least       the maintenance and possibly an increase of rates.In these circumstances we think that the mergershould be required to reconsider the proposed capitalisa-with a view to tion / the elimination of the  9,000,000 &quot;B&quot; shares andthe substitution for the &quot;A&quot; shares of Ordinary shares soeaifiedwithout any  /       rate of dividend.     These ordinary shares would be of two classes to be allotted to the Cable and Marconi interests respectively.     Both classes would rank equally for dividend up to 7-g per cent, any surplus available for distribution in dividends after the payment of the 7-f per cent to go In the proportions of 65 per cent to the Marconi class of share and 35 per cent to the Cable class of share.In the event of the merger refusing to entertain a suggestion of this character and insisting on the inclusion of &quot;B&quot; shares on the capitalisation we .think that the Government should insist on the nominal val\ie of those shares being reduced from  1 to l/-each.(3) It is proposed to include in the merger activitiesof the Marconi interests such as the manufacture and sale of radio and gramaphone apparatusj we think it very desirable that the Government should prssa fortho morger boing restricted to purely communication services.
0 *&quot;! n A* i 0T;e accordingly (by a majority) recommend the Cabinet  :-(A) To reconsider their decisions reached on tho 17Lh February, I92S (Cabinet 9 (23), Conclusion 2) In favour of the retentioncf the operational control of the Post Office Beam Services and of a pooliiig system and in substitution therefor to accept in principle tho policy of an &quot;all in1 merger, on the following general lines -(i) a fusion of the Cable and Marconi Companies.(ii) the merger thus formed to acquireby purchase the Imperial Atlantic, Pacific, and perhaps the &quot;&apos;cst Indian Cables.(ill) the Beam installations to be leased to the merger for a period of years.(Iv) the consideration for (iii) to be thepayment by the merger to the Governments of a royalty on all communication . services arising or terminating in the British Empire whether Beam or Cable. The royalty to be fixed at such an amount as will compensate the Governments for the anticipated profits on the Beam.(B) That acceptance by the Government of the general principle should be subject to th e following conditions and stipulations -(a) That the right to determine the future conduct of wireless telephonic services should be reserved to the Government and that accordingly the merger should be Informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain is not prepared to sell or lease any form of conrnainication by means of telephony and will require as a condition of the lease of the beam telegraphic services that provision shall be made for the use of wireless telegraph stations or portions thereof by His &apos; ) Majesty&apos;s Government, if desired, for telephonic purposes upon royalty terms.(b) The arrangements r:!ust comprise adequate and satisfactory safeguards against possible foreign control.(c) In order to secure satisfactory and effective contz^ol by ,the Governments of general policy and of;rates the merger must accept -(1)    An Imperial Advisory Committee ,, nominated by the governments to advise on general policy Including inter alia, the maintenance of essential sqfrvices, the institution of new services, and the control of the services in the, event of war or other national emergency.
(2)    No increase of oxisting races without the agreement of the above body with an appeal in the absence of agreement to the Railway and Canal Commissicuc(3) A substantial percentage of any revenue above a standard revenue from Imperial Goinmuni oat ions to be applied to the reduction of rates on Imperial services.(d) That satisfactory terms can be arranged au to the price to bs paid by the merger for the cables and tho royalties to bo paid for the lease of the Beam.the(e) That/capitalisation proposals of the morgcr should bo reconsidered with a view if possible to the entire elimination of tho  9,000,000 &quot;5&quot; shares or at least, to the reduction of the nominal value of those shares from 1 to 1/- .(C) That in addition tc tho above every endeavour should be made to exclude from the proposed merger activities of the Marconi interests such as the manufacture end sale of&quot; radio and gramophone apparatus and to confine the merger to purely communication services.(D) To authorise the Secretary of State for Scotland to announce the above conclusions to the Imperial Wireless Conference and to suggest to the Conference that negotiations should now be opert-dwiih the merger interests on the basis cf the proposals outlined in (A),   (B) and (C; above and that thoce interests should be informed that provided an agreement satisfactory to the i empire Governments can be reached no objection in principle to the merger or to the transfer thereto of its cable and beam assets by the British Government will be raised.Signed on behalf of the Committee, JOHN GimOBR.Chairman.litahall Gardens, 3.W.1, 27th April, 1928.

The Rt. Hon. Sir John Gilmour, Bt.. D.S.O., M.P., Chairman,Imperial Wireless and Gable Conference, 2. Whitehall Gardens. S.W. 1. Sir, London, April 13, 192s.The Eastern-Marconi Merger.1. IN accordance with your instructions we have examined the financial basis of the proposed amalgamation of the Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies with the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, Limited, and we beg to submit an interim report. This report has not been communicated to the Companies and its provisional conclusions might be modified by discussion with them.Our examination has been conducted with a view to informing the Conference on the specific points set out in document I.W.C. (2S) 72 and to reporting generally on the proposed capitalisation of the Holding Company by means of which it is intended to effect a fusion of interests of the two groups concerned.2. Before attempting to reply, however, to the specific points raised by yen we think it is essential that we should explain in general terms the manner in which the proposed capitalisation of the new Holding Company and the division between the two groups were determined. To some extent the questions to which we are asked to reply presuppose circumstances which do not in fact exist; question No. 6, for example, asks how much of the proposed capitalisation is regarded as covered by different classes of assets. As we explain in paragraph 4 lielow. the capitalisation was not determined on an assets basis.3. The proposed capitalisation is divided between the Cable and Marconi groups as follows : Cables. Marconi. Total.     54 percent. Cumulative PreferenceShares of  1 each ...     20.000.909 3.500.000 23.500.00074 per cent. Non-cumulative &quot;A&quot;Ordinary Shares of  1 each    13,200.000 8.000.000 21.200.000&quot; B &quot; Ordinary Shares of  1 each      3.150.000 5.850,000 9.000.00036.350.000        17.350.000 53,700.0004. This capitalisation was based primarily on estimated earning capacity in 1928. Each group prepared statements of what they considered to be their present-day earning capacity, or, to speak more correctly, their anticipated earnings for the year 192S in the light of existing circumstances and in the absence of a merger. These statements (which we deal with in more detail in paragraph 9) gave the following results : Anticipated earnings for 1928   Cables ... ... ... ...      2,227,655Marconi        ... ... ... ...        688,7662,916,421The Accountants acting for each group then examined in a general way each others statements on the basis, as we understand, of accepting the accuracy of the figure-prepared by the respective Companies rather than of spending time in examining what were necessarily only estimated figures incapable of exact ascertainment. The estimates, however, were fully discussed; items included or omitted were challenged by the other side and points in favour were raised and set against points adverse to a particular Company. To take an example, the Cable Companies challenged an item of  27.500 included in the Marconi estimate for 1928 for profit on the sale oi Canadian-Marconi shares, but as an off-set to this the Marconi Company pointed to
the fact that in their 1928 estimates they had deducted an additional  20,000 on the 1927 expenditure figure for no other reason than to be on the safe side. The Marconi Company, on the other hand, challenged an over-statement of the Cable Companies&apos; profits to the extent of  60,000, but were met with the argument that no credit had been taken for an estimated saving in expenses during 1928. The discussion developed on these lines without resulting in any specific adjustment of the original figures of net estimated profits, each group expressing themselves as being satisfied that they would be able to maintain their estimates.5. It was claimed, however, by the Marconi Company that they should receive some substantial immediate concession from the Cable Companies to reflect the potentialities of wireless communication as compared with cables, and in the end it was agreed that the Cable Companies should concede roughly  100,000 in their earnings, such sum to be added to the estimated Marconi earnings. Allowing for this concession by the Cable Companies, and as a result of further bargaining, the estimates of earnings ultimately became :  Cables        ... ... ... ...       2,090,000Marconi      ... ... ... ... 792,5002,882,500As against       ... ... ...       2,910,4210. After the above discussion of the approximate earning capacity of the respective groups, the capitalisation was considered.It was decided that in respect of the liquid assets in each group (including invested Reserves) the New Holding Company should issue 51 per cent. Cumulative Preference shares of  1 each. Statements of liquid assets which were prepared and have been produced to us brought out the liquid assets in each group as follows :  Cables       ... ... ... ...      20,196,742Marconi      ... ... ... ...        3,656,859On the basis of these statements it was agreed to issue Preference shares of the following nominal values involving the dividends shown : Cable. Marconi.   Cables- 20,000,000 at oh per cent.      1,100,000Marconi- 3,500,000 at 5h per cent. ... 192,500The total estimated earnings being...      2,090,000 792,500There remained an estimated balanceof profits amounting to ... 990,000 600,000This balance of profits is to  becapitalised on a 7i per cent.basis by the issue of non-cumula-tive &quot;A&quot; Ordinary shares of 1 each as follows: Cables- 13,200,000 at 7* pet-cent.   ...         ...         ... 990,000Marconi- 8,000,000 at 7h percent.   ...         ...     &quot;   ... ...               600,000This exhausted the estimated earnings, but a further issue of &quot;B&quot; Ordinary Shares of  1 each was decided upon in order to determine the division of the equity for the future, that is to say, of any increased profits in the future. The amount of such capital and its division between the two groups was essentially a matter of bargaining and cannot be illustrated by reference to earnings. The parties had regard, however, to the desirability of fixing the total capital of the proposed Holding Company at a figure which they considered did not exceed the total value of the tangible assets of both groups.[17528] n 2
For the purpose of comparing these assets with the proposed capitalisation  (a.) The Cable Companies prepared fully detailed statements (which have been produced to us) showing what they consider to be the value of their Surplus Assets under the three mainfroups of Companies (Eastern,  Western and Eastern xtension) combining assets and liabilities of all the principal  and  Subsidiary  Companies.    The combined Surplus Assets of the Cable Companies brought out in these Statements (after deducting the excluded debenture and preference stocks) amounted to    ... ... ...    50,497,723(b.) The Marconi Company built up the value of their Surplus Assets on the basis of the Balance Sheet figures at the 31st December, 1926, after adding estimated profits for 1927 and appreciation of holdings in Associated Companies whose snares are quoted.  The amount was taken roughly at     ...      5,000,000Making the total Surplus Assets  ... ... ...     55,497,723Against the total capitalisation of ... ... ...    53,700,0007.   The preceding paragraph may be summarised as follows : -1 n       i   -     t-i.   .. t-, i To produce o\ per cent. Cumulative Preference bhares        Cables. Marconi.of  1 each                     *20,000,000 at b\ per cent. ... ... 1,100,0003,500,000 at ol per cent. ... ... ... 192,5001\    per   cent.

We now proceed to deal with the specific questions which have been put to us, and to make such observations as we think necessary on the above figures, always bearing in mind that the parties arrived at an agreement on broad lines and not on the basis of agreed or exact figures.9. Question 1.  What is the present net earning capacity of the cable anil wireless undertakings respectively ( Present &quot; refers to the period beginning from the 1st October, 1927) in respect of (a.) 7Jhe transaction of communication services sub-divided, if possible, underthe headings of cables and wireless respectively. (b.) The conduct of manufacturing operations. (c.) Royalties on wireless patents. (d.) Investment of reserves. (e.) Other sources, if any.The only statements prepared to show the respective earning capacities of the Cable and Wireless undertakings are those referred to in paragraph 4 above. Those statements were drawn up to show the anticipated earnings for the year 1928 and may, therefore, be taken to represent the (i present&quot; earning capacities. Although the period covered does not commence at the 1st October, 1927, the estimates of cable revenue havo to some extent been prepared by reference to the receipts for the three months October to December 1927, as compared with the corresponding three months of 1926, and also by comparison of the earnings of 1926 with those of 1927.
The following are details of the estimated profits: Cable Companies   (a.) Communication  Services  (Cables): CrossRevenue, less Expenses         ... ...      1,519,885(b.) Manufacturing           ...         ... ... Not applicable.(c.) Royalties and Wireless Patents ... ... Not applicable.(d.) Investment Revenue     ...         ... ...         879,971(e.)

No allowance has been made for depreciation or obsolescence of Cables, Land Lines, Buildings and Ships belonging to the Cable Companies.(2.) No allowance has been made for large cable renewals, which the Cable Companies have in the past charged to Reserves.Note. Part of the cost of such renewals no doubt represents improvements and could he capitalised, but, in our view, the major portion would be a charge against revenue.(3.) The Marconi Company&apos;s estimates include the profit realised on sale of canadian-Marconi shares. (4.) A sum is included as profits which is actually an anticipated receipt inliquidation of a debt. (5.) The profits are over-estimated by  53.000, resulting from an error in estimating expenses.It is an open question as to whether the Cable Companies should allow in their estimates of profits for depreciation in addition to charging large renewals (points (1)
and (2) above), but we hold the view that, following the ordinary practice, both renewals and an appropriate charge for depreciation should be made.Taking all the points we have enumerated into account and also further small items and points in favour of the Companies, our present opinion is that the profits at  2,882,500 are over-stated, unless the Cable Companies are able to show that they will effect very substantial economies in working expenses.10. Question 2. -What amount would on the above basis be available for dividends on the capital of the proposed new company, after providing for interest on the Cable Companies&apos; debenture and preference stocks excluded from the proposed merger and for reasonable reserves for depreciation and for amortisation&apos;1. The total profits on which the capitalisation has been based, asindicated above, amount to       ... ... ... ...      2,882.500which figure already allows for interest on the Cable Companies&apos; debenture and preference stocks excluded from the proposed merger.In our opinion, a substantial sum should be deducted to cover necessary adjustments of the estimated profits, including provision for renewals and depreciation which we have meanwhile estimated at ... ... ... ...        382.500And there would remain a balance available for dividends on      - the capital of the proposed new Company, amounting to     ...      2,500.000Subject to the following : (a.) No allowance has been made in respect of reserves for the expansion of the business, such as the Cable Companies have, in the past, made a practice of setting up, but the investments constituting the Cable Companies&quot; existing reserve funds will be available for this purpose after the merger.(b.) The above estimated revenue includes the full proportion of the earnings of certain partially-owned Companies, although a sub-stantial part of these earnings may not be distributed as dividend.11. Question 3. What amount will be required to provide dividends on the proposed capital of the new company, including an appropriate return on the &quot; B &quot; Ordinary Capital!The net income of the new Company would require to be the sum given in column 1 below to provide the dividend indicated in column 4 below on the &quot;B &quot; shares: 2. 3.Dividend on Dividend on 4.1.  23,500,000 5  per       21,200,000 7i per Dividend on  9,000,000Earnings. cent.

An expansion (without increase in rates) does not seem to us out of the question, but obviously at the present moment can only be a matter of conjecture.12. Question 4. (a.) What market prices for the various proposed issues of the neio company would be eqiiivaleni in the aggregate to the market valuation of the issues of the old companies (other than the issues excluded from the merger), these latter being valued in each ease at the highest quoted price between the 1st January, 1926, and the 10th January, 1928?(b.) It is observed that the proposed capitalisation (including the Cable Companies&apos; debenture and preference stocks) is much in excess of the market
53.700.000 34,117,000(6.) The market prices for the issues of the old Companies at the dates mentioned would not necessarily reflect accurate knowledge either of the prospects of the Companies or of their very large reserves. Moreover, the market prices would at any given date be affected by many factors entirely extraneous to the Companies themselves, such, for instance, as general money rates or speculative interest in a particular share or stock.13. Question 5. Particular attention is directed to the prospects of the Marconi shareholder. Taking the market price on the 30fA September, 1927 (21/1-4-to 22/9, say 22/-), as a fair valuation, what is the real return which the merger will give the Marconi shareholder on the assumption (a.) That the new &quot; B &quot; shares pay no dividend. (b.) That they earn 5 per cent. (c.) That they earn 10 per cent.At present the Capital of the Marconi Company consists of :  1,281,589 Debentures convertible into 427,196 Ordinary Shares of  1. 250,000 7 per cent. Participating Preference Shares of  1 each. 3,250,038 Ordinary Shares of 10/-.Assuming that all Debentures are converted, and taking each 7 per cent. Preference as equivalent to two Ordinary shares of 10/-, the total capitalisation is  1,281,5S9 Debentures convertible into ...         ... 427,196 ordinary shares of  1 each, equivalent to   ...         ... 854,392 shares of 10/-Ordinary shares of 10/-         ...         ...         ... 3,250,038 shares 250,000 7 per cent.

What justification for such excess can be given!(a.) We can only answer this question on the basis of certain hypotheses. The total market value of the issues of the old Companies on the basis of the highest quoted price in each case between the 1st January, 1926, and the 10th January, 1928, would amount to approximately  34.117,000.Xote. It should be noted that the prices on which this figure is based were prices ruling for the different stocks at different dates.I f the 5A per cent. Preference shares of the new Holding Company are assumed to be worth par and the &quot; B &quot; Ordinary shares of  1 each are valued at 2/- to represent their future potentialities, the market prices for the issues of the new Company, which would be equivalent in the aggregate to the market value of the issues of the old Companies as given above, would be as follows :  .  .23,500,000 5A per cent.

Question 6. flow much of the proposed capitalisation of the new company is regarded by the companies as covered respectively by: (a.) Free and liquid assets, such as investments in securities outside the business.(b.) Physical assets in current use (at first cost less depreciation).(c.) Investments in subsidiary or allied companies.fd.) Royalties already in operation, patent rights, licences, &amp;c.(p.) Valuation of goodwill and equity.(f.) Valuation of manufacturing activities.The Conference would also desire to be advised whether, in your opinion, the valuations adopted by the Companies are fair and reasonable.We have already explained that the proposed capitalisation of the new company has not been determined on the basis of assets, except that the parties considered that tangible assets existed of a value not less than the proposed total capitalisation.Adopting the figures which were prepared for the purpose of this comparison between total tangible assets and total capitalisation, the following are the details required under the headings given in the questionnaire:

The figures given above, however, in respect of the Marconi Company have been prepared by ourselves, and bring out approximately the Surplus Assets figure used in the negotiations, as explained in the earlier part of our report.Owing to the magnitude of the task, we have been unable to examine the figures brought out in the above statements in any considerable detail, but from such examination as we have been able to make we have formed the opinion that the value put forward in the Cable Companies&apos; statement for Cables, Land Lines, Buildings and Ships was over-stated. The value included in such statement for these assets represents their actual cost without any allowance for depreciation and had been arrived at by adding to the book values all amounts written off in the past and all (&quot;apital expenditure charged against Reserves.The nominal amount of the capital allocated to the Cable Companies, however, is very much less than the value of the tangible assets brought out above, and, conversely, the capital allocated to the Marconi Company is much greater than the value of its tangible assets.  The following is a comparison of the figures : Cable. Marconi.   150,000 17,350Tangible &quot;assets as above      ...      50,497,723 4,933,125Capital in the new holding company        ... ...      36,350,000 17,350,000Excess of tangible assets    ...      14,147,723Deficiency of tangible assets ... ... 12,416,875It will be seen, therefore, that if the values of the assets of the respective groups are taken to be equivalent to the nominal value of the capital they will receive in the new Holding Company, the value of the tangible assets of the Cable Companies as set out above would require to be reduced to the extent of about  14,000,000, and an intangible asset of approximately  12,000,000 would require to be introduced in the Marconi Company&apos;s figures to represent the value of Goodwill, Patents or Development work.It should be noted, however, that the Marconi Company&apos;s figures are taken at the 31st December, 1927, and some of their investments in Associated Companies have appreciated since that date, although not to any material extent compared with (he total capital involved.We do not intend to imply that the introduction of Goodwill into the Marconi Company&apos;s figures is necessarily unsound.     It must be kept in mind that the[17528] c

Question 7. Whether all the assets of both comqmnies and the full reserves of the Eastern Associated group are to become the property of the new Iwldiny company and what actual assessment has been made of the various classified assets and reserves in each case.The assets of the new Holding Company will only consist of the shares they will acquire in the merging Companies and only by virtue of such holdings will they exercise any control over the assets or reserves of the merging Companies in whom the legal property in such assets and reserves will continue to vest.16. Question 8. The anticipated earning power of the new holding company from: (a.) The transaction, of communication services, sub-divided, if possible, under the headings of cables and wireless respectively.Note. It must be assumed that the Governments will be in a position to prevent any increase in rates. At present rates beam competition has cut heavily into Eastern income. On the traffic so transferred to the beam, the Marconi Company earn only their 6  per cent, royalty on the Post Office gross receipts and the profits on their shares in certain Indian and Dominion W/T Companies. Tt may be that Sir William Plender and Sir Gilbert Garnsey have proceeded throughout on the basis that the Post Office Beam services could be taken over on easy terms and would represent a large source of future profit. It may be that their recommendations in their present form would not be practicable ou any other hypothesis. Any observations on this point are of vita! importance to the Conference.(b.) The conduct of manufacturing operations. (c.) Royalties on wireless patents. (d.) Investment Revenue. (e.) Other sources, if any.The only statements of anticipated earning power which have been under consideration in the negotiations between the two groups are those of which details have already been given under Paragraph 9, except that a statement was prepared by the Marconi Company showing their estimated earnings when full services are working.&quot;Without a similar statement of the Cable Companies&apos; anticipated earnings, which obviously the Cable Companies are unable to produce, the Marconi Company&apos;s statement is insufficient to provide an estimate of the future profits of the combined concern, but we give the information it contains for what it may be worth.Marconi Company.Estimated Profits when full services are working.

It will be seen from paragraph 9 that the estimated royalties under the Beam agreement with the G.P.O. are. taken at  20,000 for the year to the 31st December, 192s. which compares with  10,400, the actual royalties for the year to the 31st December, 1927. The figure given above for royalties &quot; when full services are working,&quot; amounting to  300,000, is intended to include royalties of all descriptions. The figure is of a nature so approximate that it was not considered possible to allocate any particular amount to the G.P.O. Beam Agreement. The figure of C300.000 compares with the  250,000 in the 1928 estimates, and the increase of C50.000 is intended to cover anticipated increases not only from the G.P.O. Beam Services, but from valves and gramophone records, after allowing for a possible decrease in broadcasting royalties. In any event, the figure has been arrived at not on the basis of the G.P.O. Beam Services being taken over, but on the basis of the present royalty arrangements.17. Question 9. In discussion with the Companies&apos; representatives it was suggested to them that rates and dividends might be controlled by means of a sliding scale, as in the case of the Gas Companies. Does the proposed capitalisation permit of such a system being put into effective operation?We should anticipate considerable difficulty in applying to an undertaking, such as the new Holding Company will represent, the method of limiting profits which is in force for local Gas Companies. These difficulties would not arise from the precise figure of capitalisation, but from the widespread and varying nature of the undertaking, particularly as regards Wireless.We think the same object might more simply be achieved by : (a.) A general limitation on the maximum profits to be derived by the combined undertakings from Imperial Communication Services, and(6.) A provision requiring any increase in the existing scale of charges (within the above limitation) to require the approval of some such body as The Railway Commission sitting with the addition of an expert in Cables and Wireless appointed ad hoc.18. Question 10.  With regard to the debenture and preference stock of the Eastern Associated group, which remains outside the merger, the Conference would wish to ascertain: (a.) In what manner the reserved stock is to be used, or whether it is to be paid off.(b.) Whether it is in contemplation to set aside a specific portion of the reserves to secure the dividends upon this stock. (c.) In what manner it would be affected or controlled by the operations of theproposed new Holding Company.The debenture and preference stocks of the Cable Companies will remain in existence outside the merger as capital in the old Companies and not in the new Company. In other words, the net earnings of the new Holding Company will be derived from dividends to be received from the subsidiary Companies after such subsidiary Companies have made due provision for the service of these stocks. These stocks will he a charge on the assets of the subsidiary Companies, and will not affect the reserves of the new Company nor be directly controlled by the new Company.Note. In the figures given in this report as anticipated earnings of the combined undertakings, due provision has been made for the interest payable on the debenture and preference stocks excluded from the Merger.19. We desire to express our appreciation of the facilities afforded and assistance given to us by the Companies and their Accountants in conducting our investigation.We are, Sir,Yours faithfully, (Signed) O.

Appendix II.SECRET. Copy No.I.W.C. (28) 55.IMPERIAL WIRELESS AND CABLE CONFERENCE, 1928.1&apos;UOPOSED ARRANGEMENT FOR POOLING OF RECEIPTS OF the cable AND BEAM SERVICES.Memorandum by Sin Evelyn Mukkay.(Submitted in accordance with I.W.C. (28) 12/// Meeting.)1.   THE aims of a pooling scheme may be summarised as follows : (a.) To secure the cables a revenue which will give them a reasonable, but notluxurious, return on the capital invested: (b.) To secure to the public prospective reductions in rates as traffic and revenue expand;(c.) To preserve an element of competition as an incentive to efficiency and enterprise:(d.) To provide a modus vivendi which will tide over the next few years without cramping development, but. at the same time, will leave the Governments concerned free to revise Empire policy at the end of the agreed period in the light of scientific improvements or economic changes.2. Any scheme constructed to meet the existing situation, whether of a pooling character or not, must necessarily be in the nature of a compromise between conflicting ideals. For example, if the cables are to be maintained without resort to a Government subsidy, the public must forgo some part of the tariff reductions which the extraordinarily low capital cost of the Beam stations would otherwise permit. Similarly, it is impossible to realise as large economies as might be achieved by &apos;&apos;omplete amalgamation, while retaining the stimulus of competition.3. It would be necessary, or, at any rate, convenient, to have several Pools or. as they are generally known, Joint Purses, both because the participating parties and their respective shares will differ and because of the disturbing factors which may be caused by the opening of new, or reorganisation of existing, services. At the outset the following Purses would be necessary :-Australian Pool Parties Post Office Beam. Imperial Cable Pacific Cable Board. Eastern Company. Australian Beam Company.Indian Pool Parties Post Office Beam. Eastern Company.Indo-European Company and Indo-European Telegraph depart-ment.Indian Beam Company. [1725G] [17584]!
South African Pool--Parties Post Office Beam.Eastern Company.South African Beam Company.4. A Joint Purse for the Canadian service is not at present required; the only parties concerned are the British Government as owners of the Imperial cable and of the British terminal of the Beam and the Canadian Marconi Company. If the latter desired a Purse, the question could be considered on its merits as a domestic matter between the British Government and the Canadian Company.It is not proposed to extend the pooling system to the Eastern Company&apos;s business with foreign countries, e.g., in South America. As matters stand, the parties concerned (the Eastern group and the Marconi Company) seem content to work with equalised rates. If an amalgamation materialises, the question automatically solves itself.Nor is it proposed, at the outset at any rate, to include traffic to and from destinations in the British Empire which are not at present subject to wireless competition e..g., the West African Colonies. In the event of direct wireless services being opened between the Dominions, eg., India-Australia or India-South Africa, a separate Pool could lie established for each if desired.The number of separate Pools may appear formidable, but their administration is purely a matter of simple accounting, involving practically no additional statistics beyond those normally required for financial or managerial purposes.The inclusion of* the Indo-European route requires further consideration, from a strategic point of view it is virtually useless as it transits a number of foreign countries; for commercial purposes tlie alternative routes via Eastern and the Indian Beam have ample margin for all possible traffic expansion. But the Government of India have a direct financial interest in the route and may desire its maintenance. If the Indo route were closed down the revenue and traffic would presumably be diverted mainly to the cables.5. The area or traffic included within each Pool will have to be carefully defined in the negotiations with the Companies. Generally speaking, each Pool should cover the traffic between Great Britain and the Dominion terminal and any destina-tions ordinarily served through that terminal; e.g., the Indian Pool would include traffic to and from Burmah and Ceylon, the South African Pool would include the Rhodesian traffic and the Australian Pool would cover New Zealand.The Eastern Company may ask that transit traffic, e.g., traffic between the Continent of Europe and the Dominions transiting Great Britain should be brought in, on the ground that this traffic may be heavily milked by prospective direct wireless services between the Dominions and Europe. This is a bargaining point, which it might pay to concede.As a quid pro quo the cables should be asked to remove the blocking rates which they at present charge to prevent traffic for certain destinations being routed at a cheaper rate part of its journey by Beam instead of the whole of its journey by cable.Rates.6. It is suggested that the existing wireless rates be taken at the outset. The cable rates are at present 4(2.above the wireless rate for full rate traffic; equalisations of rates as between cables and wireless could not be allowed because the cables with equal rates would probably attract too great a share of the traffic. But they should be allowed, and perhaps encouraged, to reduce the 4rf. differentiation to 2d., which would be defensible by reason of the superiority of the cable service in continuity and reliability.It seems reasonable that as the cables can command a higher charge because of superiority of service, they should be allowed to retain it and this differential would not be paid into the Pool.Changes in rates should only be allowed by mutual agreement between the parties to each Pool, subject to the provisions as to reductions explained in paragraph 10.
Financial Arrangement of the Pool.7. The payments into each Pool would comprise the whole ot&quot; the receipts from all categories of traffic within its geographical scope less (1) the cable differential allowed under the previous paragraph; (2) out payments or credits for transit or terminal services; e.g., on messages between Great Britain and Australia, both administrations would be entitled to receive or retain their terminal credits, whether by wireless or cable, and the balance would be credited to the Pool.8. The distribution of the receipts credited to each Pool in respect of any year would he as follows : (a.) The first charge would be the payment to each party of 50 per cent, (the percentage being open to discussion) of its actual contributions to the Pool during that year.(b.) The second charge would be the payment to each party of 50 per cent, of its &quot; Standard Revenue.&quot; The Standard Revenue is intended to represent the point at which the cables require some restriction of competition by the Beam services and would be defined as the annual equivalent of the traffic receipts of each party during an agreed period. This period would therefore have to be some period during which Beam competition had made considerable inroads on cable traffic, though not necessarily to the maximum so far attained. The period should be taken some few months after the opening of each Beam service and need not be identical for each Pool.(c.) Any surplus in the Pool after meeting the prior charges woidd be divisible in agreed proportions, which should recognise the fact that an increase in aggregate traffic is likely to be due mainly to the cheaper wireless tariff, and that the wireless services arc surrendering something appreciable with a view to giving the cables the minimum revenue without which they cannot exist.9. The question arises whether the Companies should be guaranteed their share of the two prior charges on the Pool, in other words, whether the Governments should guarantee the solvency of the Pool. There is always the possibility of the Pool becoming insolvent owing to a general decline in telegraph traffic, the diversion of traffic to new routes not comprised in the Purse or reductions of rates. If the Companies press the point, it might be possible for the Governments concerned to guarantee the prior charges subject to the proviso that repayment should be a first charge upon any future surplus.10. The agreement for each Purse should provide that when a Joint Purse has shown a surplus exceeding 10 per cent, over two consecutive years reductions of rates absorbing the equivalent of two-thirds of that surplus shall be conceded. The distribution ui&apos; the reductions over all or any of the various classes of traffic would rest with the parties of the Pool, but they should be required to consult the Govern-ments concerned. Alternatively, the reductions might take the form in wdiole or in part of the institution of new cheap classes of traffic.The effect of this provision would be that as soon as an appreciable increase of traffic appears to have been established a considerable proportion of the extra receipts will be released for the benefit of the public.11.   The following simple illustrations show the working of the formula :  Assume the traffic during the standard period on a certain route wasCable  100,000, Beam  120,000.(a.) Assume it grows, but with a changed distributionowing to Beam competition to Cable  90,000, Beam  150,000.  The Cables will get 50 per cent, of its actual receipts ...      -   45,000 Plus 50 per cent, of its standard revenue ...      =   50,000Plus (say) 40 per cent, of the surplus  ... ...      =     4,000Total      ... ... ...... = 99,000as compared with the  90,000 it would get under the competition system.The Beam would get 50 per cent, of its actual receipts - 75,000-Plus 50 per cent, of standard revenue ... ... = 60,000Plus (say) 60 per cent, of surplus       ... ... = 6,000Total      ............      = 141,000
total the Beam would get 50 per cent, of actual receipts ... Plus 50 per cent, of standard revenue ... Plus (say) SO per cent, of divisible surplus     ...Total      ...... ......and rate reductions absorbing two-thirds of the surplus, or  30,000, would take place in the following year.12. There are a number of subsidiary questions which would have to be included in the Joint Purse agreement, e.g.(1.) An undertaking would be required from the Companies to maintain iu good working order such cables as the Governments considered necessary for Imperial purposes.(2.) Provision as to continuance or otherwise of the Pooling arrangement in the event of prolonged cable interruptions.(3.) Some form of arbitration clause to settle disputes whenever necessary.(4.) It may possibly be desirable to provide in some form or other that the parties to a Purse shall, in fact, undertake the handling of an equivalent amount of traffic to the revenue which they receive.(5.) The diversion of traffic as between cables and wireless when necessary.13. A Pooling arrangement on these lines would be independent of an amalgamation of the Marconi and Eastern undertakings. It would be possible, though perhaps difficult, to carry it out without the Dominion Beam Companies being parties to it, In that case, the Pools would either have to be confined to outward traffic or to one-half of the cable receipts and the whole of the Post Office Beam receipts. A Marconi-Eastern amalgamation might from this point of view be convenient as the Marconi Company would probably be more disposed to induce its subsidiaries in the Dominions to come into the Pools.14. The Pooling arrangement would in no way prevent an amalgamation or working agreement on whatever lines might be desired between the Eastern and the Pacific Cable Board, which would have to be decided as a matter of policy by the Governments concerned. It might be mentioned also that a Pooling arrangement on these lines is confined solely to revenue and is not concerned with the expenditure or internal management of the constituent parties, who themselves reap the benefit of anv economies which they can effect.(Signed) G.

CO^ilTTEi-, Oil POLICY WITH HaSAIU) TOOQrttPiiTivioa&quot;is^xT/kiilf&apos; bIam i.iaihLi*j.j and oabl^ companies.MEMORANDUM by Sir Otto Kieraeysr and Sir William ,ucLintock.I.We have considered the pooling Scheme outlined in I.V/.C.28 (55) ao an alternative to a complete &quot;all-ir.&quot; merger of British Cable and Wireless Interests.Tho Post Office proposal involves three separate Pools (Australia, India and South Africa) with different partners in each, without dealing with Canada or with the African Protectorates.   Each separate Pool i3 to receive the gross traffic receipts of its area less a cable differential of 2d. (instead of the present 4d.) and the payments for transit and terminal services.    From each pool the various partners are to receive -(a) say 50$ of their contributions to the Pool plus(b) 50/3 of standard revenuethe balance to be distributed in agreed proportions.    Any Pool shewing a surplus exceeding 10;* for two consecutive years is to devote two-thirds of the surplus to the reduction of rates.The precise financial prospects of these pool3 oannot be readily ascertained though tho Post Office think they might have to be guaranteed by the Government.    But wo make one general remark.    If the Cables   are to be maintained even if the standard revenue is fixed at a point at which the not earnings of the Cables have been substantially reduced by Beam competition, the result may be that the Cable Oompanios&apos; gross receipts will not meet their expenses in Bpito of their receiving a subsidy at the
expense of the Beam..   Why. should the Wireless Companies aocept such a position?The Post Office admit at the outset that &quot;it is impossible to realise a3 large economies (from any pooling scheme) as might be achieved by complete amalgamation&quot; and the variouspapers circulated to the Conference repeatedly refer to the economies in working which should be achieved by amalgamation.   We do not doubt that these opinions are correct.    The essence of a pooling arrange-ment must be to maintain the earnings of tho partners in the pool at more than they would be with indiscriminate competition.    There is to be no pooling to reduce expenditure.    The partnership is ex hypothesi of the loosest and most unrestricted kind.    Pooling represents little more than an armistice during which each party keeps the fullest possible organisation against all his allies. It is not a union free to turn all its resources and energies to conducting a large public service, and to facing external corn-petition from other countries.In any case there are other very important considerations to which pooling px^ovides no answer.   Merger means, in addition to agreement on rates,  (a) unity of control, and (b) unity of adminis-tration and direction.    These fundamental objects are not attained by pooling.    It is for His Majesty&apos;s Government to say whether they attach importance to unity of control and unity of adminis-tration from the point of view of public interest.   We would only venture to remark that it is common commercial experience that pooling arrangements are rarely satisfactory and that in recent years they have been generally abandoned in favour of complete amalgamation.    They are elaborate, cumbersome, fraught with friction and the dissipation of managerial energy and rarely proof against wangles.We could not ourselves recommend any such arrangement as a hopeful solution of the problem before the Conference.We would further add -(l) that a pooling eoherao is far remote from the propositions of tho Companies and would necessitate a oomplete revision of
tho arrangements which they ho.vo announced provisionally and contingently on Government concurrence.(52) that so far ao we knew no such arrangement has been suggested to tho Companies.(5) that wo see very littler reason to suppose such a scheme could have any attraction to the Companies, unless it v/ero on terms far from attractive to the public.   At any rate there is no ground for thinking that a scheme securing the advantages hold out by the Post Office in reductions of rates to tho public could be achieved.   Tho Post Office for instance do not appear to exclude a Government guarantee of the solvency of the Pool (paragraph 9).   We aro unable to see any ground for treating communications on uneconomic lines at the ex-pense of the general taxpayer.(4) So far aa we aro aware none of the Dominions favours pooling.(5) So far as we are aware, none of tho largo and formidable foreign combines is based on any such arrangement.(G) Unlike previous Common Purse arrangements between Cable Companies alone the partners in the proposed Pool would represent the conflicting interests of Cables and Wireless.(7) The parties to a Fooling Scheme would include a comparatively large number of Cable and V.&apos;ireless Companies and to obtain the agreement of the various bodies of shareholders interested would, in our opinion, present conaidorablo difficulty and might give riso to undesirable publicity, ur conclusions are therefore -(a) that it is improbable that a pooling arrangement could bemade in present circumstances with tho Companies:(b) that it is difficult to see how suoh an arrangement could,from a public point of view, be a satisfactory substitute for united direction and administration.
tu,CIn considering any other 3chcmo than pooling ib would naturally ho necessary for Eis Majeatyrs Govorament to he satisfied (inter alia) on two points -(1) The consideration for the future value of tho PostOffico Beam,    aud (2) The control over undue monopolistic tendonoies in thenew Company.III.On the first point it must bo remembered that one of the criticisms of the proposed Ltorgor scheme is the high capitalisat?&quot;&quot; of tho future equity of the Harconi Company. Tho Post Office might find it difficult to avoid similar criticism if they seok to capitalise the future prospects of tho Beam too high at the expense of the 3eam using public.Further, the Beam is not tho only system of communication in which His JJa;)o3ty:s Government is financially interested. His MajestyTs Government is owed  1,230,000 by the Pacific Cable and would be in addition responsible for a share of the loss on that Cable if Beam competition reduced the existing narrow margin of profit.       His Majesty*s Government has advanced  400,000 to tho West Indian Cable and is liable for a share (at present approximately  4,000 per annum) of deficit on that Cable.     His I i^estyTs Government is, further, in the present circumstances responsible for the lmperir.1 Atlantic Cables which even now barely, if at all, cover expensos, before charging interest on capital.Finally, His IJa majesty s Government, if they desire   , to retain the Cables in British hands, might be involved in very heavy expenditure running to millions rather than thousand if tho Cable Companies liquidated as they could perfectly well do and disposed of thoir undertakings.     There is therefore from the central point of view of His Majestyra Government a good deal to be put against the future departmental profits
or, qnf *J ijoxpoctod by the Post Offico from tho Beam.IV.V7e aro of opinion that tho complete unification of tho ownorship and control of all Imperial Cable and Wireless services would result in moro efficient direction of the undertakings, and v/c would suggest that a complete merging of the various interests might ho effected on the following lines;-(a) A fusion of the Cable and Ilarconi Companies-(b) The Iforgor thon formed to acquire by purchase the atlantic, 7/ost Indian and Pacific Cables.(c) The Beam installations to he leased to the llorgor fora period of years.(d) The consideration for (c ) to he the payment by theliergor to tho Governments of a royalty on all coinmuni-ation   services arising or terminating in tho British Empire, whether Beam or Cable *In view of possible diversion of traffic from one system to another it would ho undesirable to havo a Royalty based on Beam services only.The Royalty should &quot;oo fixed at such an amount as would compensate the Governments for the anticipated profits from tho Beam, fo) The Government to have one special sharo in tho Horgcr Company carrying special voting rights to provide against possible foreign control. (f) 3uch a schorao would require to be oouplnci with some form of control of rates.V.The Companies themselves recognise the need of Control. They havo admitted -(a)    &quot;Tho creation of an imperial authority representative of the Homo Government and of tho Dominions and India to advise tho Companies on all questions of general
policy affecting Empire external, telegraphic and telophonic communications, such as the institution of new services, tho opening of nov/ roads, the lining xip of scattered parts of the Empire with tho telegraphic services and the Control of th services in the event of War or other national omcrgency, this Imperial authority to advise in tho fixing of rates&quot;.(b) Thoy agreo to the ultimate Control of ratos being subject to the Railway and Cain I Commission.(c) Thoy wish to work on &quot;Public Utility lines&quot;.(d) T:hoy accept an obligation to maintain all existing cables. (o) They agreo in principle to accept a standard revenue.Prima facio, therefore, if His HajestyTs Government woreprepared to authorise further discussion with the Companies on thetermsbfsis that given satisfactory/no objection in principle would be raised to an &quot;all-in&quot; merger, we sno no reason to suppose a satisfactory control arrangement could not bo reached.     Such an arrangement is clearly a sino qua non.We think what should be aimed at in this direction is -(1) An imperial advisory committee nominated by theGovernments to advise on general policy. (2) Ho increase of existing x*atos without the agreement of the above body, with an appeal in the absence of agreement to tho Railway and Canal Commission. (3) A substantial percentage of any revenue above a standard revenue from Imperial communications to bo applied to the reduction of r^tes on Imperial Services.WILLIAii McLINTOCZ:.April, 1920.
