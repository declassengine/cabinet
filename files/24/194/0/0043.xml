U odocument is the property of His Britannic i:iajesty,a Government.C A B I ii K T. .P. 143(20) __________. r. Buohah*s Pog Racing Bill...:-i-..wd&quot;;.i by       no:::-; ;-.:-;g..i;c;,a:c.The Prime Iiinister has been asked by the promoters of this Bill to give facilities for a -Second Reading and I hone tr; colleagues will agree with ray view that facilities should be given for a debate, v/ith a free vot*&quot;,  so that the opinion of the House may be elicited as soon as may be.    lir. Buchan&apos; s bill has already received a first reading, without opposition, on introduction under the 10 minutes rule.For many months past the subject of dog racing has aroused much interest in the press and in the country.    I have received many representatione? also a very large number of resolutions, both from religious bodies and from local authorities, in favour of prohibition or restriction or control of dor. racing; two representative Deputations, one of 1I.P1 s and one of Bishops, -layors and other dignitaries, have been received and have expressed similar views: and recently I received on the other hand an influential deputation from the. Greyhound Racing Society, representing trie sporting and financial interests involved and asking that these interests should be borne in mind.&apos;.n bhe meantime I have made careful inquiry of Chief Officers of Police in all districts where dog racing tracks are in being and In this memorandum I summarise the results of those inquiries, as well as the various facts and considerations that have been advanced for and against dog racing.The principal objection urged against dog racing is; that It is a mushroom growth which threatens to add enormously bo facilities for betting and, in particular, for bettiiig by many whose means would not permit of their attending horse-races.
It Is alleged that 175 companies have been formed to promote dog racing tracks; that the sole reason for the opening of traoks is to afford facilities for betting and, eventually, rpportunities to financiers and other promoters either to make huge profits for themselves by the conduct of the tracks, or tn dispose of the shares to their own advantage.   Many people are said to have been ruined by betting on dog races; resort to moneylenders and pawnbrokers is said to have increased, thrift to have been diminished, and destitution and neglect made more common: young persons and children are said to attend and make bets; drinking and disorder are said to have increased, and it has even been suggested that greyhound racing leads to crime*in favour of dog racing on the other hand it is said that it is a clean, exciting and humane sport, which does not lend itself to &apos;pulling&apos; or other tricks that sometimes occur in horse-racing, that it can be carried on, under cover, at hours when busy workers have leisure to attend -land that therefore legislation against it would be &apos;class legislation&apos;; that there are not more than 40 traoks in being or in contemplation (the other Companies having been formed for breeding, or to preserve names for use should new tracks be required); that drink is not sold at traoks, with one possible exception; that there is less drunkenness when tracks are open; that there is no disorder at the races; that destitution has not been caused; and that there is as muoh thrift now as before dog racing came in, or even more. As regards betting, the friends of dog racing say that they would favour and enforce any rule-of general application forbidding betting, on any kind of race traok, with ohildren or with young persons under a oertain age; concerning betting generally, they say that there is no more betting on dog raoing than there is on horse raoing, or on football; and that there is far less street betting, or other betting by persons who do not witness the events on which they bet.
In short, the contention of the opponents of dog racing is that it is a new and speoial development, the attendant evils of which require special measures; while the friends of dog raoing say that it is not attended by speoial evils, but has several meritorious aspects,. and that it would not therefore be fair to propose speoial measures discriminating against it (although they defer for the present any proposal that it should, for instance, be brought within any new enabling measures, such as that for legalising the totalisator.)Opinion being thus sharply divided, an attempt has been made to get at the faots.   In January a questionnaire was addressed to the Chief Officer of Police in every district where dog racing tracks were in being,    17 replies were received concerning 22 tracks, of which 4 tracks were in the Metropolitan Police District.The general effect of these replies is:-I. There is much betting at dog-races (including some betting by persons in receipt of unemployment benefit,  just &quot;as there is at horse-races; but there is no evidence of any street betting, or betting-house betting on dog-races.-In one or two plaoes dog-racing appears to have led to less betting on football, and in London, Birmingham^ Sheffield and, probably, Manchester, less betting on horse-races.Few children or young persons attend dog-races unaccompanied by their parents.   There is very little betting at dog-races by young persons and none by children, nor do young persons or children bet away from the traoks; on the other hand young persons do bet on football and, to a Iobs extent, on horse-raoing.II. There is no evidence of Increased pawning or debt; and next to no evidence of increased destitution.III. There is evidence that drunkenness, disorder and drinking have decreased rather than inoreased.   But some public houses near tracks have had extra customers who have been drawn from publio houses further away.
IV.   There has been no disorder at the tracks. V.   Dog-raoing in the open air has drawn people away from public houses, cinemas and theatres, but not from football matches or horse-races.It may be said that these replies effectively dispose of any oase for measures specially directed against dog-raoing, but it must be remembered that dog-raoing goes on at each track for 3 or 4 nights eaoh week and that, as time goes by, it is almost certain that dog racing will familiarise an increasing number of adults and many young persons and ohildren with betting.Not much light is to be gained from experience in other oountries.    In two countries where bull-fighting is popular, Spain and Mexico, there is prohibition either on the one hand of grey-houncUracing or on the other hand of betting thereon? and so also in three States of Australia where horse-racing is popular.   But in the Free State, France and Germany there are said to be no restrictions.    Our own law already discriminates in favour of horse-races (betting at which is not prohibited so long as no &apos;place&apos; is localized) for, under existing law, betting at dog-races is illegal, not only if any ^laoe&apos; is localized (e.g. by making a fixture of a bookmaker&apos;s box) but also if the track is unenclosed or if the promoters or the owners of the land exhibit notices prohibiting betting.   If the totalisator is legalised for horseraoe6 only, there will, for the time being at any rate, be still further discrimination against dog-races.I have already made it clear that I intend at the first opportunity to introduce legislation prohibiting betting with ohildren or young persons under a certain age on any kind of race or event.   Personally I favour, further, what I take to be the principle of Mr. Buohan&apos;s Bill, namely, that local authorities should have a disoretionary power to licenoe, subject to conditions, or not to licence, a proposed dog race traok.      In any seoond reading Debate with a free vote I propose to state
that as my personal view, expressly reserving however the right-at a later stage, to suggest various amendments, e.g. to make it clear that there must be a real exercise of disoretion by licensing authorities, and no harsh and unconscionable closing of existing tracks.I think it is high time that the whole question should be ventilated in the House and I hope my colleagues will support the view that facilities should be given as Boon as practicable for a Second Reading Debate with a free vote and, if the Bill obtain a a second reading that facilities should be given at a later date for further stages if possible.Vf. J. H,30th April, 1928.
