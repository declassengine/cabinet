After e:chaustive discussions with the representativesof the Basel Trading Company, Mr.. liacmillan conferred withthe Committee and was authorise?, to mahe an offer in full and final settlement of all claims by the- Company against Kisiiajesty1 s Government in relation to the Company&apos;s business in the Cold Coast Colony.     The terms of this offer whichwere communicated to the Company&apos;s representatives by Mr0Llacmillan on llaroh 23th 1928, sot out in paragraph 10 ofLir-o Macmillan&apos;s Report to the Committee which is attached here to (See Appendix) are as follows&quot;Having carefully consider or.&apos;. with the assistance of hlr&apos;* Roy Wilson, the representations and evidence adduced in support of the claim of the Basel grading Society, I now offer, subject always to the approval of His Majesty1s Government, the following terms in full and final settlement of all claims by the Society against His majesty&apos;s Government in relation to tho business of tho Society in the Cold Co^st Colony, vlzs-
(1] that the lands and buildings which formerly belonged to the Society in tho Gold Coast Colony and are now in the possession of tho Corxionv/oalth Trust Limited shall be rootorod to the Society free of any encumbrances;(2) Th...t tho sum payable to tho Society bo fi::ed at  250,, COO;Provided that the Soc ioty undorta3:o(a.)

Since receiving his Report tho Committee have againconferred with LIr0 liaemillan and Mr. Roy Wilson, and they understand that apart from Proviso (b) the Basol Trading Company are ready to clcso with the Covornmenfs offero     Mr. Hacmillar has also informed the Committee that at his request
tho representatives  - . of tho Companyprepared tho following formula which they wished to substitute for Proviso  (bK    This formula was, however,given to Mr0 ilacmillon v;ithout prejudice and on thodistinct underst-lading &quot;-hat it would not be regarded orused in any way as a bargaining counter, nor quotedagainst the CompanyProvided that the Soclot&quot; loeiaro that it is i&apos;hv.&quot;.r intention tv adhere to their established, waofr;.co of devoting a substantial proportion of their distributable profits to missionary i-jud other philanthropic purposes in all parts of the world (including the British Emp.ix&apos;e) - (through the niedium of trustees) and that in the application of si-ob. proportion full regard will be paid to tho iieo^-s of tho Gold Coast Colony on a scale not less than has been followed, in the past.It will he observed that the effect of this formula differs from the terms finally submitted by Kr* Ilaccillan to the represent sent at ivos of the Company mainly in tho following respectsI&apos;or the calculation of -the proportion of distributable profits to be devoted to missionary and philanthropic purposes., the limit of 1C$ dividend disappear and the undertaking by the Company as opposed to a simple declaration is confined to the soiling cf liquor, guns, etc and does not apply to the Missionary and philanthropic contribution.
9,     In the events which have happened three possible courses are open -(1) the Government mi^ht accspt the formula suggested by the Company.(2) The Government mi  lit insist on theretenticn of proviso (b) in the formin which it appeared in the offer asmade to the Company, or alternativelytho Government miidit offer to accept the Company&apos;s formula subject to the substitution of the &quot;ord  &quot;undertake1 for the expression &quot;declare that it is their intention&apos; in the first line,.10.     The arguments In favour of (i) may be summarised asfollows  :-(3)of proviso (b) is a very favourable i and Mra Roy(a) apart from tho question the proposed settlement one;   both hr- Ivacmilla Wilson are impressed *.vith the reasonableness and moderation of the Company1s claim (apart from the claim for interest which they have refused to discuss) and the figures on which it is based and consider that an impartial arbitrator would give the Company a substantially larger sun than the  250,000.(b) the representatives of the Company absolutely decline to enter into any under-tai:in;;r respecting their future profits -on this point i:r. IJapmillan reports thatthey a:aur.a.that ho ha3 failed tomake any impression upon them and that no settlement by agreement can be looked for if an undertaking is insisted upon.      In support of their attitude the Company point cut that the principle upon which the Government is relying is that of restitution, the Company should therefore be put back in its former position, it has always in the past, devoted its surplus profits to religious and philantropic purposes and intends to re sums its former practic-e, but it questions the right of the Government to impose uponreinstatement and it resents being compelled to do rhat it has always dene voluntarily in the past and. intends to do In future. In x-his connection it should be remembered that the property of the Company was only .Impressod with its present binding trust in 1C19 and that this yrss clone at the instance of tho British Government.-o-
(c) V/hilo no doubt the declaratory formula suggested by tho Company could not be onforeod in a Court of lav;, it could still bo exiforecd in fact by administrative action in the Gold Coast.    If for oxomplo the Company fail to devote a substantial proportion of their distributable profits to missionary and other philanthropic purposes, the Government of tho Gold Coast could institute an inquiry and if necossary put prossuro upon the Company to implement their declaration.    It is possible that action of this character would In fact be more effective than recourse to legal proceeding to enforce an undertaking.(d) It is now admitted that the Company has a good equitablo case for reinstatement0 Failing a settlement by agreement it would in tho long run be impracticable to resist recourse to arbitration..   An arbitrator might not only substantially increase the amount of compon-s at ion, but might adopt the Company1s view in regard to this particular issueP(e) After very full inquiry and much dlscaission with the parties Hr. Macmillan and lire Roy Y/ilson both agree that it would be preferable to accept the Company&apos;s formula rather than that no settlement by agreement should be reached.The case against acceptance of the Company1s formulamay bo stated as follows -fl) In making tho Governments offer to the Company, Mr. liacmillan made it clear that tho terms were final, incapable of sub-stantial modification and must be accepted or rejected within a definite time limit. If rejected all negotiations were to be regarded at an end and no further offer would be made or claim.entertained *    Ih spite of this clear v/o.rning the represent-atives of the Company have deliberately elected to reject the Governments condition and mast take the consequenceso(2) There is a vital difference between the undertaking formula in proviso (b) and the declaratory formula offered by the Company, the first Is a definite    contract which is capable of enforcement in the Courts, the second is a mere declaration of intention involving no legal obligation and incapable of being effectively enforced or controlled by the Courts or oven by administrative action in tho Gold Coast.(3) Tne property of the Company   as impressed with a trust after the war   tho strength of tho case of tho Commonwealth Trust and those supporting it lies in the allegation that property now held upon definite trusts for religious and philanthropic purposes may and probably will be diverted to other usoso By insisting on tho
Company entering into an undertaking, the Government would have a complete answer to such criticisms, but would have none if the declaratory formula was accepted. On the other hand public opinion would support the Government in insisting on this reasonable stipulation ove? at the expense of an agreed settlement.

(4) The fact that the issue has been raised makes it difficult for the Government to recede, and it might be desirable to offer to increase the £250,000 to say £300,000 if in return the Company would agree to give the  undertaking.

12. The Committee have requested Mr. Macmillan to inform the representatives of the Company that the Committee are not prepared to accept the Company&apos;s formula but that they have decided to recommend the Cabinet to accept that formula if modified by the substitution of the word "undertake" for the expression "declare that it is their intention" in line 1, and that the Cabinet&apos;s decision would be communicated to the Company on April 2nd next. In substance this would mean that if the Company will undertake to adhere to their established practice of devoting a substantial proportion of their distributable profits to missionary and other philanthropic purposes the Government will waive their requirement that, in future, dividends declared by the Company should not exceed ? per cent. per annum.
13.     The Committee accordingly by a majorityrecommend the Cabinet :-That the Basel Trading Company shouldbe informed forthwith that His XxB abfcy sMajesty1s Government is preparedto settle the claim upon the terms-if their offer cf 28th &quot;arch subjectto the substitution of the followingproviso for proviso (b) of that offer.&quot;Provided that the Society undertake to adhere to their established practice of devoting a subctantia1 proportion of their distributable profits to mi33lonar-- and other philanthropic purposes in all parts of the world (including the British Empire)      (thro\:gh the medium of trustees! and that in the application of such propoi-tion full regard will be paid to tho needs of the Gold Coast Colony on a scale not iojs than has been followed in the pas b&quot;.A minor-it    of the Committee wish to add that,  in the event of the Company rejectins this proposal the claim should be settled on the basis of the offer of 23th Karch subject to the substitution of the Company&apos;s formula for proviso (b).Signed on behalf of the Committee,SALISBURY,CHAIRMAN.2 Whitehall Gardeno, S,rc&quot;.l, 51st March, 1923.

1. Having received a request from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, through the Attorney General, that I should act as a negotiator on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government with a view to arriving, if possible, at a settlement of the existing dispute between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Basel Trading Society in relation to the Society&apos;s business on the Gold Coast, and having informed myself as to the nature of the points at issue by a perusal of papers furnished to me by the Secretary of State, I attended on the l9th March 1928 a meeting of the Committee of the Cabinet in the Ministers Conference Room at the House of Commons. Mr. R. Roy Wilson, M.P., whom the Secretary of State had invited to assist me in the matter was also present.

6.    ay a fortunate circumstance wo wore ablo to avail ourselves of the services of L&apos;r, Gibbons, who had acted as Comptroller of Cnoay property in the Gold Coa3t, and on chocking with him the figures in the foregoing statement we found that they amounted (disregarding interest) to a Bum loss, by some 215,000 than tho figures contained in Mr.Gibbons&apos; official record.7.    On 23rd Larch we had a conference with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General on matters arising but of the progress of our negotiations,3&apos;.    On 27th March wo mec with the Committee of the Cabinet and obtained further instructions.9.    The case for tho Trading Society was placed before us by Mr. Laurence Johos with conspicuous oare e.nd moderation, and was critically examined by U3 to the best of our ability, with the material available.    On behalf of the Society Mr. Laurence Jones called as witnesses Mr. V/ra. and Mr.Max preiawerk, LIr.Arthur 3dgar Sylvester, C.A., and Mr. Walter Bartholomew, a V.FS3t African trader.
