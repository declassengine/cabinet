coosid erable moment, should the United states of America at any time press for arbitration in connection with belligerent righta.   &quot;;7oul5 it be possible to resist such pressure or would it not be maintained by the United States of -jserica under tho wording of the proposed Draft Treaty, that either we had shown ourselves disingenuous or really had no grounds for trying to evade arbitration? /5)    It ic understood that treatiec are in particular commonly held to be suitable subjects for arbitration, and in this category nay be included tho Declaration of Paris and the Hague Conventions which affeot belligerent rights.   T7ould it not bo the case that United States of America would be justified in oontonding that any dispute about the infringement of treaty obligations was arbitral? Apart from treat;; obligations belligerent marltimo law would seem to bo in its nature a subject that is prima facie, justiciable, and differences regarding belligerent rights are susceptible of decision by tho application of a recognised rule of international law in theory.    In faot the oeoretary of otate for Foreign Affairs during the Great .7ar at one time agreed that blocks.de claims should be submittod to arbitration,  ana claims arising out of the exeroise of belligerent rights have been raised by the United States of *america in tho past, e.g.,  Tho Jay Treaty 1795, and the claims against Denmark in connection with the 1810 war.f6)   Moreover, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague has aotualiy dealt with similar questions as aro likely to arise, in the oases of the &quot;Carthage&quot; and the &quot;Manouba&quot; which arose out of the ineidonts of the Turko-Italian war.    One was a oase of detention and the other of taking Turkish passengers who were su-poeod to be Turkish Offioers off a ^ronoh steamer.     Thero aro thus precedents

In any case it is safor to be definite in mentioning the reservation that is specifically desired,She jurists at Gsr.2va at tho recent meeting of the Preparatory Consmisriicn, when preparing Model Arbitration Treaties, were opposed to loose and uncertain phraseology and favoured definite reservations.    On this principle belligerent rights ac sea should bo specifically reserved and included in Article 3 of tho Treaty of Arbitration with the United States^(9)    This definite reservation by name of belligerent rights at sea would not be a surprise to the United States of America as in reidifc years tho United Kingdom, the Dominions and nritlab Statesmen have definitely maintained the nood of making suoh a reservation in arbitration treaties and the fact has boon mado public;    oome instances are attaohod in the appendIoosq

Appendix 1Extract f rc-m i &quot;Lea of J2*tiona Official Journal Special Supplement Hc^.2jS.    Minutes of the ThirdCommittee.Report of M. Benes and Genoral Discussion on the Draft Protocol submitted by tho Fourth Sub-Committee (Annex 9).Mr. Henderson (British Empire) ........,I come now to the question of the reservations which tho British Government Kill feel themselves obliged to make In accepting th-D obligatory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court and this new procedure of oompulsory arbitration0     These reservations relate to disputes arising out of warlike operations in which the British Empire may in the future be involved-      Let there be no misunderstanding. In the view of the British Government, it is not conceivable that the British Empire should be at war against the Covenant or against the stipulations of this new Protocol. V;e therefore only envisage &quot;the case in which we are engaged in warlike operations on behalf of the Covenant and with the approval of the Council or the Assembly of the Leaguea V.&quot;e are sure that in such a case as this It would be necessary and desirable in tho goneral interest, as well as in tho particular interest of Great Britain,  that the British Fleet should be abio to operate with the freedom that may be required to secure the rapid success and termination cf the sanctions.     We propose therefore, vhen vie accept the obligatory jurisdiction cf the Court, to make a reservation to the effect that disputes arising out of warlike operations undertaken by the Eritish Empire in support of the League shall not be referred to tho Permanent Court for settlement.     It will be observed that a similar reservation appears in Article 5 of the Draft which is laid before the Corjnittoe.     Those reservations do not appear to us in any way to limit the value of what wo are doing to-day. No one desires that the Permanont Court should become a body for controlling military operations.     Its purpose and the purpose of these new arbitration arrangements we hope to set up is to prevent war altogether, by securing the peaceful settlement of disputes a     V/e believe, therefore, that in safeguarding the liberty of action of the British fleet - which, above ell things, It Is necessary for us to safeguard - wo are not acting contrary to the general interest of the nations of the world/
Extract from the &quot;time a&quot; of 12th November. 1927, Add 1+3si&quot; by Lo rd jh&apos;ey there were two reservations to be made as regarded both the Optional Clause and the &quot;All-in&quot; arbitration tree ties,     One was that they must not refer to internal afftirs.     And acts committed when a nation was at war, especially measures taken on tho sea, were not suitable for arbitration.     Before the United States cams into the war they took a very narrow view of what might be done in the way of blockade.     After they came into the war they joined with the Allies in carrying the rights of blockade and interference with neutral commerce to a point that had never been reached before.     Thus in ono war one country had taken very opposite views of what was right and wrong with regard to blockade,     That meant that on such a matter there v;as no agreed law, and precedents were valuless because they could be invoked on every side.     There was, therefore, no standard by which any tribunal could decide such cases.     Nor could thay expect a country which was fighting for Its life to hold up for arbitration the acts which it considered essential to bring pressure to bear on an enemy.     Arbitration thero might be on such things, but It must come after ths war and net vhile the war was actually in progress.     Having made these reservations, he would urge that the Government, by taking the tv;o stops which he had suggested, would be making a contribution to the feeling of security in the vvorld and setting an example which other nations might follow.
Extract from Oomnand Paper J24o3LBut conaidoratloti of the minor interests of New Zealand in this respect is negligible as compared with admission of the Permanent Court as the deciding factor in u-reat oritainfs belligerent rights at aoa,    It seems to us idle to contend, as has been contended,  that, inasmuch as such questions would only effectively arise during actual war, and as the assumption is that Groat Britain will only wage war with the consent of tho League, therefore the point may be waived.    That saems to us idle because the question would be raised by neutrals whose vessels were stopped and searched for contraband.    It is with regard to the rights of His i.iajesty&apos;s ships against neutrals when Great Britain is at war that difference exists between the opinions of foreign jurists and the decisions of tho English Courts.    And it seems obvious that the effect of adhesion to the Protocol would be deliberately to accept a foregone conclusion against the exercise of privileges in war which are essential to the defence of the Empire.
APPENDIX 4.

Terms of the arrangements for the disposal of certain pecuniary claims arising out of the recent war, in which H.M. Government in Great Britain and the Government of the United States are interested, either as principals or on behalf of their respective nationals.

May 19th, 1927.

His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain and the Government of the United States agree.

2. That neither will present any diplomatic claim or request international arbitration on behalf of any national alleging loss or damage through the war measures adopted by the other, any such national to be referred for remedy to the appropriate judicial or administrative tribunal of the Government against which the claim is alleged to lie, and the decision of such tribunal or of the appellate tribunal, if any, to be regarded as the final settlement of such claim, it being understood that each Government will use its best endeavours to secure to the nationals of the other the same rights and remedies as may be enjoyed by its own nationals in similar circumstances, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain agrees that fullest access to British prize courts shall remain open to claimants subject to the right of the British authorities to plead any defences that may be legally open to them.

3. That the right of each Government to maintain in the future such position as it may deem appropriate with respect to the legality or illegality under international law of measures such as those giving rise to claims covered by the immediately preceding paragraph is fully reserved, it being specifically understood that the juridical position of neither Government is prejudiced by the present agreement.
