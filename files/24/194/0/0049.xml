COPY NOCABINET.AMERICAN PROPOSAL FOR A MULTILATERAL TREATY --------poR&apos; TIILr&apos;REfro!rcTSP ion OF WJHCSPSP.CK AT WASHINGTON BY MR. KELLOGG ON APRIL ggTH. 1023, -------QlpgHB ^eHOH^RAW:(Circuited in accordance with Cabinet 27(23),Conclusion 3 (e))oWASHINGTON.A.pril 29th, 1923.LIr. Kellogg, the Secretary of State., last night delivered a speech here before the American Society cf Intelsational Law, in which he discussed in detail what he called &quot;The si:: major considerations which the French Government has emphasised in Its correspondence on the subject of a multilateral treaty for the renunciation of war, and in the draft treaty it has submitted to the Powers.&quot;     The address was a clear and cogent expression of the views of the United Stats:; Government on these six points, views which have been a3.rea.dy made known, but which Mr. Kellogg now expressed with new vigour.Express recognition by the treaty under discussion of the &quot;inalienable right&quot; of self-defence. Mr. Kellogg urged, would give rise &quot;to the same difficulty&apos;encountered In any effort to define aggression&quot;, for it was &quot;the Identical question approached from the other side&quot;.     No treaty provision could e.dd to the natural right of self-defence, and accordingly &quot;it is not In the interest of peace that the treaty should stipulate a juristic conception of self-defence,  since it Is far too easy for the vnsorupulo\is to mould events to accord with an agreed definition toLEAGUE AND LOCARNO.Of the Covenant of the League, Mr. Kellogg remarked that it imposed &quot;no affirmative primary obligation to go to war&quot;, for the obligation, &quot;if any, is secondary, and attaches only when deliberately accepted by a State&quot;. There was,  in his opinion, no necessary inconsistency between the    Covenant and the idea of unqualified renunciation of war, for, though the Covenant could bo construed &quot;as authorising war in certain circumstances&quot;, this was &quot;authorisation and not positive requirements&quot;.On the subject of the Locarno Treaties Mr0 Kellogg remarked that if they contained a positive obligation to go to war, &quot;such obligation certainly would not attach until one of the parties has resorted to war in violation of its solemn pledges thereunderCOIIFISEIfrLAL. 0,P. 149  (23).
It was, therefore, obvious that &quot;If all parties to the Locarno Treaties became pai*ties to the multilateral anti-war treaty proposed b^ the United States there would be a double assurance that the Locarno Treaties would not be violated by recourse to arms.     In such an event it would follow that resort to war by any State In violation of the Locarno Treaties would also be a breach of the multilateral anti-war treaty, and the other parties to the anti-war treaty would thua ac a matter of law be autematically released from their obligation thereunder, and free to fulfil their Locarno commitments&quot;.     The United States was &quot;entirely wiping that all parties to the Locarno Treaties should become parties to its proposed anti-war treaty either through signature in the first instance or by immediate accession to the treaty as soon as it ccmes into force in tho manner provid3d in Article III cf the American draft,&quot; and &quot;will offer no objection when and if such a suggestion is mado,&quot;NEUTRALITY TREATIES-Of treaties guaranteeing neutrality mentioned by France, Mr. Kellogg said that without further Information he could not discuss their provisions, but it was not unreason-able to suppose &quot;the relations between France and the States whose neutrality she has guaranteed are sufficiently close to make it possible for France to persuade 3\\ch States to adhere reasonably to the anti-war treaty proposed by the United States.&quot;     No party to the anti-war treaty could then attack neutralized States without a violation of the treaty, which would automatically free France and her co-signatcries from their obligations, while if the neutralised States were attacked by a Power not a co-signatory, the anti-war treaty rould have no effect, &quot;and France would be as free to act under treaties guaranteeing neutrality as If she were not a party to the anti-war treaty .MR. Kellogg briefly reiterated the view that since, as a matter of law, violation of the multilateral treaty by one party would release the others from the obligations to the treaty-breaking State, express recognition cf this principle would be wholly unnecessary, and passed to the question of ^universally&quot;.     He held It preferable not to postpone the coming into force of the anti-war treaty until all the nations of the world can agree upon a text, for &quot;a State so sittmted as to be no menace to the peace of the world might obstruct agreement or delay ratification in such a manner as to render abortive the efforts of all the other Powers&quot;.
A PI - ACT IG.,\L GOARAKPSEHe thought it highly improbable that a treaty-acceptable to the six Great Powers would not be equally so to most, if not all, the others, but   even were this not the case, the coming into force among the si:-: Powers of an effective anti-war treaty and their observance thereof would be a practical guarantee against a second world war.&quot;     He added, this in itself &quot;would be a tremendous service to humanity&quot;, and declared that the &quot;United States is not willing to jeopardize the practical success of the pro posal it has made by conditioning the coming into force of the treaty upon prior universal, or almost universal, acceptance,.&quot;There need be no question cf what the United States Government, speaking thro\igh the mouth of its Secretary of State, desires to say.     It considers the French reservetiens as such unnecessary and unacceptable, but for the moment prefers to repose upon arguments against them rather than resort to a plain refusal to agree to -heir e:::b.--di:nentvin the treaty.     Th^-re still remains the rossibilit.   that other lovers may lean in some degree toward the French position, and if this were so it would be necessary to seek a ground of compromise.     Where this compromise might and - so far as the*United States is concerned - probably would be found has been already indicated.     The provision that when one of the signatories to the anti-war treaty was &quot;Involved in&quot; war the other signatories would be released from their obligations to that Power would, It is believed, meet the cape amply.xtracted from &quot;the times&quot;, April 3Cth, 1923).2 Whitehall Gordons, S.W.1.Hay 4th, 1923,
