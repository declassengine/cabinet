SECRET.cp 103. (88).--------77 C A B I KB T,piSARWAHggg... ^PR Cfc gp:Q3GfS AT C5HEVA.Copy.: Of letter frOm. ^^C^ioellor of tha Duchy ofXcchx&apos;    j yy &quot;Seal tCOircojfited^at , This ^ l^oquoff t, of the Lord nPgr;77 Seal) 0Hotel Bcau-Rivage, GENEVA.21 at March,  1923 cMy dsax&apos; Salisbury,I have to thank ycu most warmly for you.;? letter of the 17th.7vith regard to cur proceed jugs out here, I at first, like you, viewed with considerable misgiving our Admiral&apos;s conversations y/j.th other Admirals, and the first telegram he sent to the Adr;dralty, which I only saw after Its despatch. But it is very difficult for ycu at home to appreciate the conditions out here,     Hie technical advisers of the different Delegations ax-e constantly meeting, either at luncheon cr dinner parties or on the golf-coarse, and it is impossible for them altogether to avoid talking &quot;shop&quot; when they meet, and many things are said in this v;ay which appear much more solemn and formidable when they are telegraphed home.     I have now rather changed my opinion and have come to the conclusion that these conversations have not done any harm, and&apos;.; on the other hand, have gained for us the valuable knowledge which we should not have otherwise got of the conversations which took place In1Paris between theThe MOst Hone The Marquess (-f Salisbury, ICG.
American and French naval experts.     It Is true that these conversations are quite at variance with what you call &quot;the celebrated conversation between Austen and Briand&quot;, but the curious thing is that no one here, except nyself and my staff, knows anything about this conversation, and I feel Inclined to suspect that Briand, as soon an he returned to Paris, forgot all about It.     At all events, he appears to have sent no instructions to monsieur Glauzsl, the French substitute Delegate v:ho is taking the place here of ?aul-BOncour who has goiie off electioneering.     In a conversation with Clauzel, I referred to Briand&apos;s talk with Auyten, but he said he knew nothing about It and he flatly refused to take the strong line about the Russian proposals which briand had said ought to be adopted.     ?hi9 also applies, of course, to 3riand&apos;s agreement as to the policy to be pursued in regard to the naval and military clauses respectively of the Draft Conventions, and, so far as I am concerned; I have to act exactly as if the Briand-Chamberlain conversation had never taken place. However, I believe that Cadogar. is telegraphing on this point to-night so I need not pursue it further, but I may be faced to-norro?; with a critical position as regards an adjournment of the Draft Conventions*     The Russian proposals will probably be turned down one way or another, but there are a certain number of Delegates who will desire then Immediately to go on with the second reading,  and it is quite possible that it may be difficult to secure an adjournment or even to get anyone to take the initiative in proposing it unless I do it myself, which my instructions, with which I fully concur, tell me not to do if I can possible-y avoid it.
v:e have had a real comedy here for the last day or two in regard to the Russian proposals.     Everybody whom one met up to Saturday last was full of proposals for rejecting the Russian scheme and wore tumbling over each other in the gsllant action they were all resolved to take to this end.     By Sunday evening it was made -clear to me that they were all e;:pectir.g me to open the battle as scon ag Litvlnoff had uncovered his batterieso the I was quite determined not to do; V:-:obtuse I could not feel sure that, if I made an elaborate criticism of his scheme, everybody else might not sit silent and leave it to be said by ail the pacifist papers and crowd all over Europe that the greatest proposal ever made to mankind for getting rid of armaments was frustrated by the obstinacy of the British Government.     I therefore put it abo.it that I vvac doubtful whether I should take part In the debate at all and that,  if I did, It would only be at a comparatively late stage in Order to support some one or other of the resolutions hostile to the Russians.      On Monday evening I met several of the Delegates at a dinner party- when I took advantage of a passing indisposition to intimate that I was not sure tha-I should be able to attend the session on Tuesday at all, and still more doubtful that I should feel well enough to speaks     I was told about lunch-time on Tuesday that the Chairman had been running about all morning trying to find someone to speak., without succeeding In his quest., a about an hour before tie time firced for the afternoon session.. Monsieur Clause 1 came vo see me In an evident
strto of trepidation and told rr.e that a number of other Delegates v:ere congregated in an adjoining room discussing what they re garde 1 as an alax-wing situation. He again said to mo that he thought it was surely my duty to take tha Initiative at 4 o!clock.     I asked him why the Pole or the Jugoslav or the Greek should not step into the breach, to which he said, evidently not seeing his slip, that he thought it was quite necessary that the initiative should be taken by one of the Grsyt Peters.     I towed to hi&quot;- and said &quot;What Power, Monsieur, is greater than France?&quot;.     He seemed confused for a moment and said it was not consistent with his instructions to take the initiative against the Soviet proposals.     I said I regretted to hear it, but that I was afraid I must adhere to my decision not to do so either.     He then spread out his hands in appeal and said:    &quot;But, Monsieur, what will happen if no one givet, a lead?11. .  Affecting complete indifference, I said I supposed the Russian proposals would be adopted unanimously. He said he thought that was impossible *      I replied that I agreed it ??as undesirable, but; of ccur5je, If no member of the Coronittee expressed dissent, I saw no other alternative.     By this time we had to leave for the session.     When I got to the Hall I found that the Italian representativewhom none of us had ever taken into consideration - a General, elderly, fat and Inaudible -had with incredible gallantry given his name in as a speaker and was sitting in front of a typewritten document.     He was called upon at once, and in a short but direct speech proposed that the Russian
scheme should be summarily rejected.     When he sat downmy French friend rose and made a very mild and shortspeech, mostly concerned with details of procedure.Kowever, 1; thought that this artillery preparation from two of the Great Powers was sufficient to enable me to 5go over the top with comparative safety, and I accordingly emptied my-magazine into the Russian trench.     Whether it caused any casualties there or not I have no notion, but it was quite effective in bringing courage to others of the attacking party.     Two of them got up when I sat down and continued the assault, and this morning, if I may change the metaphor, they were a pack of hounds giving tongue on a warm scent.     It remains to be seen exactly how the Russian proposals will be dealt with whether by direct negative or by reference to some other body for examination in detail, and the only point upon which I am now anxious is about getting them entangled, If possible, in the Draft Conventions so as to secure a postponement of the latter.     Unless this is accomplished, I shall be thrown back on my Instructions for dealing with the Conventions, and the old deadlock may quickly be reproduced, as the French Delegate continues In ignorance of the Briand-Chamberlain conversation.Yours very sincerely, (signed)    CUSHENDUN.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.March 27th, 19280
