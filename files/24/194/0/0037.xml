COPY WOjSJL BINE T, SILVER IN THE IRISH FREE STATE.onMcmorvndura by the Treasury,  (Circulated by dlyoctio ,  b&quot;ir&apos;She T&amp;aiiceiloF&quot;cf^Ehe&quot;ExcEequer3.I. 1c   The Irish Free State are about to introduce a new currency of their own.     British Treasury Notes circulating in that Dominion will be replaced by Irish Free State Currency Notes and British silver coin by a ne?; Irish Free State silver coinage.2.   The introduction of a now silver coinage in the Irish Free State raises questions for consideration.3.   The Irish Free State has asked that the British Government should take back the British silver coin which Is circulating In the Dominion and which Is estimated to amount at face value to seme  3 million. The British Government is not under obligation to buy back this coin and the Irish Free State Authorities have been informed that it will not do so.4.    If this silver coin were bought back at face value, it could not be put to any use in this country where supplies of silver coin are already excessiveo It would have a bullion value of about 40 per cento of its face value and the remaining 60 per cent will be a pure loss to the British Government.     The Irish Free State would make a large profit by coining silver coins out of bullion bought on the market.
Oft?5*   Tho proper course is for tho Irish Free State Authorities to melt ;!own this coin and re coin it-     They could probably do so at a profit, for their new coins will contain   750 of silver, while most of the British coin1C00circulating In Ireland contains .J?25.10005,    In order to ensure that this British coin from Ireland shall not be sent back secretly to this country and swell the stores of silver coins in the Banks here, with the result that the British Government would probably be asked to relieve the Banks of It, it is necessary to amend the existing law by oxtonding the power given by Section 2 of the Customs (Amendment) Act 1966 of prohibiting by proclamation the Importation of certain classes of foreign coin, so as to cover the importation from a foreign country of silver coins of the realm.7.    It is proposed, If the Cabinet see no objection to introduce a one clause Bill with this object in the course of the present Session.     The matter Is not of immediate urgency as the new Irish Free State silver coinage will not be ready for so.r.e time.II. 8.    Certain Irish Bank3 have a right of issuing privatenotes.     Some of these notes are fiduciary notes covered only by securities.     The balance of the notes they issue must be covered by legal tender, gold or currency notes, but at the option of the banks up to one fourth of this legal tender may take the form of silver coin.ii The Irish Free State is a foreign countr-r within the meaning of the Customs (Amendment) Act.
9,     After the new Irish Free State currency system has been introduced, Irish Banks operating In the Free State though they will still have certain rights of note Issue there, will not have the right of holding silver coin as cover for their notes.     So far as they also operate In northern Ireland they will continue to be entitled to hold silver coin in their offices in Northern Ireland up to one fourth of the cover for the notes they issue there, 10.     At the present time, Irish Free State Banks holdp in offices in the Free State, British silver coin estimated to amount to abotrl  500,000 as cover to their existing notes.     At any moment they may transfer this silver to offices in Northern Ireland where it can be used permanently as cover for their exclusively Northern. Irish Note issue or, if more than is needed for that purpose, can be gradually disposed of fcr cash011.     There appears to he no reason why this silver, which now acts as cover to notes circulating throughout Ireland but mainly in the Free State, should be dumped upon Northern Ireland, merely because the Free State have decided to have a separate currency system.12,     The legislation referred to In the first part of this note would, when it is passed, enable the transfer of this sliver to Northern Ireland to be prohibited.    But as the transfer might take place at any moment before the legislation is passed, the best chance of rendering thi3 legislation effective for this purpose is to introduce it immediately and pass it through all stages to the Royal Assent rith the greatest expoditioneISc     Assuming that the Cabinet agree that tho legislation referred to in the first part of this note should be

The legislation referred to in the first part of this note would, when it is passed, enable the transfer of this silver to Northern Ireland to be prohibited.    But as the transfer might take place at any moment before the legislation Is passed^ the best chance of rendering this legislation effective for this purpose is to introduce it immediately and pass It through all stages to the Royal Assent &quot;&apos;ith the greatest expedition^13o     Assuming that the Cabinet agree that the legislation referred to in the first part of this note should be
introduced, the question for decision is whether it should be Introduced irunodiately and passed with the utmost expedition in the hope of preventing the transit to Northern Ireland of the  500,OOC of silver referred to in the second part of this note.14.     If aisy substantial delay occurred between the introduction and the passing of the legislation, this silver might very likely be hastily removed to Northern Ireland in the Interim as tho Banks cannot assume the readiness of the Irish Free State Government subsequently to relieve them of it..Tre a s ury Chaariber c, 25th April, 1923.-4-
