T0 BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND   KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document,CABINET.POLICY COMMITTEE.Second Report.1. THE Policy Committee was directed to advise the Cabinet whether it would be possible to carry the scheme set forth in CP. 8 (28) during the present Parliament.Frequent meetings of the Ministers concerned and their technical advisers have been held. Simultaneously the various branches of the subject have been explored by Ministerial or official sub-committees. The work of these sub-committees is embodied in the various Reports printed in the Appendices to Annex I. The work of all the sub-committees has been brought together in the First Report (Annex I) of the Policy Procedure Committee, an official Super-Committee presided over by Sir John Anderson representing all the Departments concerned. That Report covers all the Appendices and deals in their various aspects with all the considerations that appear to arise about the practicability of the scheme.2. Basing ourselves upon this Report and its - Appendices and upon our own constant investigations, we are of opinion that the question asked in our reference can be answered affirmatively. Should the Govern-ment consider it desirable on general grounds to proceed with the plan, no insuperable obstacles will be encountered in Parliamentary time and procedure, in Local Government legislation or in Finance. On this we are all agreed.[17446] b
3. Up till a lew clays ago we had been working on the basis, modified where necessary, of the scheme as set out in the Chancellor of the Exchequers paper (CP. 8 (2b)). Under this scheme railways, docks, gas and electricity were to be two-thirds de-rated. A fixed rate of&quot; 5/-, roughly equivalent to one-third of the average rate burden, was to be paid to the Local Authorities in part payment of the compensation due to them for their loss oi rateable value. The various Appendices and Sir John Andersons First Report, particularly paragraph 3G. show the considerations which arise upon this. In this process of examination we have, all of us become increasingly disinclined to the two-thirds derating of the public utilities. Gas and Electricity in particular will raise a host of difficult questions about how their rating relief is to be passed on to the consumer, including the burning question of what it is. even in present circumstances, fair for consumers to pay. Railways, Docks and Canals stand together. We see great difficulties in using these means of communication for the purposes of affording special reliefs to selected traffics as was originally proposed. Complicated legislation, the reproach of an arbitrary subsidy to particular industries, and trade wrangles all tell heavily against such a policy. It may be the only way. but it is a roundabout way. On the other band the freight reductions coming on the top of the rate reliefs are alone capable of producing the cumulative effect in helping the heavy industries which it is the primary object of the policy to procure. Without this additional freight relief the help to heavy industry is diminished to such an extent that the Chancellor of the Exchequer doubts whether the remaining advantages arc sufficient to justify the exertions and risk which the policy entails.4. At this point we are divided between two views. The view of the majority of our Committee is that all public utilities should lie left out of the scheme, i.e., left where they now are &apos; un-de-rated.&quot; This would leave  121 millions more rate income in the hands of the Local Authorities. This sum is almost equal to the  13 millions which would have been left to them by the fixed or national rate. The distribution of the  12&apos;, millions among the Local Authorities would be somewhat different from that of the  13 millions &quot; fixed &quot; or National rate. The Supplementary Report by Sir John Anderson&quot;s Committee (Annex II), shows that the alterations, such as they are, mitigate rather than aggravate the position of particular areas where the proposed changes produce extreme results not. of course, in the financial resources of these authorities, but in the degree of change to which their affairs are subjected. The majority of the Committee, therefore, hold that the fixed rate should disappear altogether, and that productive industry should be finally and completely taken out of the rates.5. The simplifications which would follow from such a decision would be enormous. Many of the plans which have formed the successive stages of our inquiry and bulk so largely in the appendices to Annex I would
become mere empirical stages in the discussion. There would be no legislation about railways and no discussion about a subsidy to selected traffics. There would be no derogation from the principle that the tools and plants of industry ougbt not to be used as a basis for taxation. There would lie no need to explain why an average one-third rate burden should be left upon them; or why that rate burden should be fixed nationally and not variable with each district. There would be no trouble about the assessment of new businesses and extensions, for the whole process of the assessment of productive industry would have finally ceased. There would be no need to explain why the fixed rate should lie paid direct to the Local Authorities and the balance made up as a mattet of accounting from the compensatory Exchequer grant. There would be no need to define the possibilities of a further addition to the compensatory grant on account of the considerations set forth in paragraph 17 of Appendix VI11* to Annex I. The whole plan resolves itself plainly and bluntly into taking productive industry entirely out of the rates and compensating the Local Authorities by grants from the Exchequer whose general revenues would be reinforced for that purpose by a tax on imported liquid fuel. The Secretary of State for War, the President of the Hoard of Trade, the President of the Board of Education, the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Transport (who has been present at all our discussions), and the Chancellor of the Exchequer are decidedly in favour of this course.It is clear that if this plan were adopted some additional compensation would have to be given to agricultural producers in order to preserve to some extent their present relatively advantageous position over other industry. This might take the form of a direct reduction of agricultural freights on the railways at the expense of the Exchequer and would lie a fulfilment of the expectations held out in the Prime Ministers Election Address.ti. On the other hand the two Ministers who are most closely acquainted with the problems of local government and who have the direct responsibility of negotiating with the Local Authorities, the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland, strongly prefer the retention of the fixed 5/- rate on industry and its direct assignment to the Local Authorities. The Minister of Health has explained in Appendix II to Annex I the reasons which have led him to this opinion.   Apart from the question* As regards (lie quinquennial revision of the grant, we feel that, if allowance for low rateable value, as proposi-d. is to lie made in the. formula, the only equitable course would be to calculate the grant as if the fixed rate were, in fact, paid to the Exchequer and then deduct from the grant to each area an amount equal to the produce of the fixed rate actually raised at the time of the revision in the area. Under sueli an arrangement, however, the advantages which tile Minister of Health wishes to secure would be largely lost. and. if it is decided to allow local authorities to retain the a/- rate, it will be necessary to consider further what adjustment of the rateable value factor in the formula can lie made to allow of tiie growth in the produce of the rate being- permanently retained by local authorities.[17446]
of the incidence of the new financial arrangement compared with the old, he attaches serious importance to the connection through the operation of a local rate between local industry and local government and to the incentive thereby provided for business men to contribute an invaluable element to local counsels. The minority therefore, while favourable to the general policy of the scheme, would be inclined to reduce it to more modest limits by retaining the national rate and by leaving the proceeds in the hands of the Local Authorities ,and they would advocate or at least acquiesce in the exclusion of public utilities from the scope of de-rating. They therefore can only associate themselves with this Report subject to the serious reservations which follow it (see p. 7).7. In these circumstances the Treasury is now examining as a new and improved variant the possibility of giving Local Authorities an interest in the growth of local industry by means of an addition to the compensation grants of an Exchequer payment proportionate to any industrial revival or expansion which may occur in the future. This grant would have to be considered in relation to the douceur of  m. 3 (or mori&apos;) referred to in these papers. In this connection the following Inland Revenue figures are of interest. The total profits of all trade groups coming under charge to Income Tax were :  m. 894 875 778 830Making allowance for the normal growth of wealth and population of  m. 10 a year, on which the Treasury have hitherto relied, the total of 1927 ought to have been about  m. 930. This was the basis on which the estimates presented to the Cabinet in January by the Chancellor of the Exchequer stood. In fact, we are now  m. 100 short of what was reasonably expected, and  m. 64 below the results of 1924. Some will attribute this alarming result to the Gold Standard: others to the coal stoppage: and currency enthusiasts will urge, though without reason, that the latter was caused by the former. However it may be. the fact remains that the total trade profits for Income Tax purposes are  in. 100 below the normal; and the yield of Income Tax from this cause alone is  m. 16 below expectations. With the present trade prospects and the gradual escape from the strike period, trade and its consequential revenues should rapidly recover. It would appear, therefore, that the Local Authorities might with safety be given a share in any such recovery (if it takes place), having regard to the much greater advantage which the Revenue would gain. The best proposal that we have been able to devise consists in paying to the Local Authorities xj- in the   on their Schedule A assessments on[Most Secret-11924 1925 1926 1927
industrial property. This proposal, however, only partially meets the views of the Minister of Health.S. The Chancellor of the Exchequer accepts responsibilityj for financing (with or without any addition discussed in the preceding paragraph) the full Scheme as recommended by the majority of the Committee. He would require for this purpose to strengthen the Revenue by a Liquid Fuel tax equivalent to a flat Zd. on ali imported Liquid Fuel. The final shape of this tax. which has been exhaustively studied in its numerous aspects, would he submitted to the Cabinet as part of the general financial arrangements of the year. Certain negotiations and consultations with the diverse interests concerned are still impending, but no difficulty is expected in presenting the tax in what is finally considered to he the most expedient form in time for the introduction of the Budget on April 24.The question of adding to the weight of the tax on Liquid Fuel in order to afford a substantial relief on the existing Horse Power Motor Licence Duties is a separate important issue. On it a recommendation will be made by the Treasury in due course.If, however, the Cabinet came to the conclusion that the views of the minority must be the limit and measure of the policy, the Chancellor of the Exchequer would wish to raise the general question of whether the relief to industry involved in the two-thirds remission of rates without any aid to the basic and heavy industries from freights justifies the labours involved; and he reserves to himself the right to recede from any such enterprise.9. The Secretary of State for War. while actively in favour of the majority proposal, holds strongly that the supersession of the Boards of Guardians by County Authorities will be administratively, and still more politically, injurious. His support of the proposals is therefore limited by tiiis reservation.10. The Committee must now refer these serious differences and wide measures of agreement to the Cabinet for provisional guidance. It is indispensable before we separate for Easter that a definite decision should be reached on : (a) the question at issue between the majority and the minority of the Committee; and (b) whether in the light of that decision the Scheme should be pressed forward or dropped. This decision is urgent and, so far as this Parliament is concerned, irrevocable. Unless the Liquid Fuel tax is imposed in this Budget, there is no prospect of financing the Scheme: and there is no sense in announcing it without showing that the money will be there and how it will be raised. On the other hand, the difficult questions connected with the Local Government sphere are in some respects less urgent. It would not be necessary in the Budget statement to deal otherwise than in general terms with the methods by which the Local Authorities would be compensated for their loss of rateable value. The Government need not be committed in detail to this part of the policy until
Treasury Cham hers,March 29. 192S.the main Hating Bill is produced in November. Every argument of prudence and expediency would counsel this reserve. It would not, however, be right for the Government to take a decision for action on the whole Scheme, unless they were prepared in the ultimate issue to face the transference of Highways and Poor Law to the County Authorities. It may well be that mitigations of this may be devised in the interval. These can lie studied at leisure.11. To recapitulate: the following questions should lie resolved by the Cabinet in the order in which they are set out: (1.) Shall productive industry be de-rated altogether as recommendedby the majority of the Committee, or de-rated only to the extentof two-thirds as desired by the minority ? (2.) Assuming that the minority view prevails, is the Height reliefupon the railways to be added to the two-thirds de-ratingrelief of productive industry ? (3.) Assuming that no such freight relief is found expedient, is it worth while going on with what is left of the scheme?Signed on behalf of the Committee :WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.
Reservation to Second Report of Policy Committee uy the Minister &quot;&apos; of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland.We regret that while agreeing with our colleagues that the question put to us in the terms of reference can be answered in the affirmative, we find ourselves, as the Ministers responsible tor Local Government, unable to assent to certain provisions which are strongly advocated by them.The difference between us turns upon the question whether industry should be completely exempted from all contributions to local services. Whether railways and public utilities should be included in the de-rating scheme is a different matter. The arguments against it are set forth in paragraph &apos;.i of the Chancellors Report, and will be considered by the Cabinet, but we wish to emphasise the fact that they do not affect our main difficulty.It is true that the vast changes in the resources available to local authorities for further rating revenue under the original scheme, changes which would in some cases have taken from them as much as 75 per cent, of their rateable value, did give rise to serious anxiety in our minds as to the reception which the scheme was likely to get from these bodies. It seemed to us that before accepting a fixed contribution from the Exchequer in lieu of the varying, but on the whole growing, produce of the rates from the properties now to be exempted, local authorities would require to be heavily insured against possible loss and would demand a proportionately hcavv premium in the shape of extra money beyond what would be required to compensate for the initial loss. It has been suggested that if. instead of a fixed rate on industrial property, that property were completely de-rated and railways and public utilities left alone, that would be a fair equivalent, and in paragraph 4 the Chancellor expresses the opinion that the Report, in Annex II, shows that the alterations would mitigate, rather than aggravate, the position. We do not think that local authorities would take this view. The railways are more or less static: the changes in their rateable value are not likely to be great, whereas the factories are constantly growing, and the prospective loss to the local authorities, if they are de-rated, would therefore be of a totallv different order. . Moreover, the Report of Sir J. Anderson*s Committee shows that in many boroughs of an industrial character the loss of rateable value would be much greater if industries were altogether de-rated and railways left rated, than if railways were included in de-rating and the fixed rate were left with the local authorities.We admit, however, that if this were our only difficulty it would be met by the proposal at the end of paragraph 7. which would ensure that the equivalent of the growing produce of a fixed rate on industrial properties would enure to the rates.     As stated in that paragraph, however, this
plan dues not meet our main objection to the complete exemption of industry from contribution to local services.To us it appears impossible to admit that such exemption is justified. We agree that the present system is unfair in that an undue share of the burden falls upon industry and that it falls with special weight in just those areas where industry is finding it most difficult to keep its head above water. But that some contribution should \ye made seems to us indisputable, in that the presence of factories does in fact directly increase the charges incurred by local authorities. Streets must be constructed, the wear and tear of the traffic induced by industry throughout the area must be made good, these streets must be lighted, cleansed and policed. Moreover, the influx of labour consequent upon the extension of industry brings new charges for housing, education, water drainage and amenities which is not met by the rateable value of the houses, nor even by the increased grant which the dis-tribution formula will bring at the end of a quinquennium. We therefore feel most strongly that on general grounds of equity and in justice to other classes of ratepayers some contribution, the amount of which may fairly be the subject of argument, ought to be demanded from industry.Finally, we view with very grave concern a proposal which severs all direct connection between the industry of a locality and the machinery of its local government. The effect of such a severance upon the interest taken in local administration by a section of the community peculiarly fitted by their training to guide its councils with wisdom and efficiency is a matter of opinion and we do not desire to dogmatise about it. But the step once taken is irrevocable, and we are unwilling to incur the responsibility of such a decision at least until we have had some experience of the effect of partial disrating to guide us.oSigned)      NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN.

Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1928.MOST SECRET. Copy No.P. (28) 18.   (Revise.)CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (28)).Annex I.FIRST REPORT OP POLICY PROCEDURE COMMITTEE.1. AT their meeting on the 1st February, 1928 (Cabinet 4 (28), Conclusion 5), the Cabinet had before them the Policy Committee^ Interim Report (CP. 23 (28)), and agreed inter alia that, pending further consideration by the Committee, it was not possible for the Cabinet to take a definite decision in regard to the Plan laid before the Cabinet on the 2()th January, 1928, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was felt, however, that the plan possessed great attractions, and that an indication should be given in the King&apos;s Speech that this subject was under consideration. The following passage was accordingly inserted in the King&apos;s Speech on the opening of Parliament on the 7th February, 1928 : &quot; The burdens imposed upon industry and agriculture by the present incidence of local rates have attracted the anxious attention of My Ministers. They are now engaged upon enquiries into the possibility of affording some relief from those burdens to the producing community and into the changes in local government which would thereby be involved.&quot;2. On the same occasion the Cabinet also agreed that, in the event of the adoption of the Chancellor of the. Exchequers Plan, the scheme should be described in full in the Budget Statement, and that it would be essential to pass a Valuation Bill, but that that part of the Plan which would be embodied in Local Government legislation should not be introduced until the Session beginning in November 1928. In the meanwhile, however, the latter legislation should be prepared not for publica-tion but as a guide in the negotiations with the Local Authorities.3. On the instructions of the Prime Minister a Departmental Committee* under the Chairmanship of Sir John Anderson have considered the scheme set out in the Chancellor of the Exchequers Memorandum (CP. 8 (28)) in various aspects, and submit the results of their examination of the scheme in the following paragraphs. A more detailed examination of certain technical questions that are involved will be found in the various appendices, of which a list is given at the end of this Report.I.-THE SCOPE OF RELIEF.4. The main object of the scheme may be compendiously described as the relief of productive industry from rating so far as relates to property occupied for manual and mechanical processes.   Where, however, productive industry occupies property* The Departmental Committee was composed of The Right lion. Sir John Anderson, G.O.B. (Chairman). Sir John Lamb, E.O.B. Sir II. t\ Hamilton, K.C.B.Sir A. Kobinson, K.C.B Sir 0. J. Itowell Thomas, (J.M.GMr. U. W. Uurconib, U.B. Mr. T. Jones.Mr. A. W. Hurst, O.B.[17446] B
which in other occupation would be rateable it would continue to pay the ordinary rates. Thus it is proposed that land and buildings used for agriculture and forestry should be relieved, but not farm residences and land used as a park or pleasure grounds. Mills, mines, factories, shipyards, workshops would be relieved, but not premises used as residential quarters, oilices, showrooms, garages, &amp;c.ij. Clearly a distinction of this character is an intricate matter, and it will be necessary not only to provide a reasonably full definition in the statute,, but also to make provision for the determination of many doubtful cases by a special tribunal. We are advised, however, by the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Ollice, who are giving special attention to these questions, that no insuperable difficulty need be anticipated under either head.Sew Undertakings.G. The question arises whether industrial undertakings which come into existence after the scheme is brought into operation should be liable to the fixed rate. The President of the Board of Trade circulated a memorandum to the Policy Committee (see Appendix IV) setting out the reasons why such undertakings should be made liable, and the Committee adopted his view.7. The question has also been considered whether the fact that public utility undertakings and mining are assessed to rates on some profits basis, furnished any reason why new or extended undertakings of this kind should be treated on a different footing from other new undertakings or extensions; no sufficient reason could be found.Rating Relief in Scotland.8. A special problem arises in Scotland owing to the fact that owner and occupier share the liability to rates. In the case of agricultural subjects, three-fourths of the rates are paid by the owner and one-fourth by the occupier. In the case of other subjects, the liability is approximately one-half on owners and one-half on occupiers.9. This problem was considered by a sub-committee of the Policy Committee, who reported (Appendix VII) that it would be impossible to defend an arrangement whereby a very large proportion of the total relief from rates would pass immediately and finally to the owners of agricultural land, and they recommended that during the currency of existing contracts of tenancy half of the benefit received by such owner should be passed on to the occupier.10. As regards de-rated subjects other than agricultural, the sub-committee recommended that, during the currency of existing contracts of tenancy, the whole benefit received by the owner should be passed on to the occupier.11. The Policy Committee accepted the recommendations of the sub-committee on both points, and adopted their suggestion that, in order to avoid a separate valuation of the farm-houses and cottages, their rateable value should be taken as one-sixth of the gross rental value of the holding.The Incidence of the Relief.12. We have given consideration to the point that the effect of derating may be to increase monopoly values with the result that part of the relief will accrue to the landlord. The great bulk of industrial property is either freehold or is held on long lease.Whether the relieved property is let for short or long terms, it would seem to be quite impracticable to attempt to frustrate the play of economic forces which would operate when terms and conditions of new tenancies are being determined.13. A further point is that under the law of rating in England and Wales the derating of properties will tend to increase their rateable value, since the amount of rates payable is an important element in arriving at that value, and the lower the rate, the higher the rateable value tends to be. The effect of this so far as it goes would be to diminish the advantage which the scheme will give to producers. It will, however, be seen (Appendix X) that the question is affected by many other
Transport and Public Utility Undertakings.14. Important questions have to be considered in connexion with the proposal to include Public Utility Undertakings in the scope of the relief. These questions raise points of principle and many detailed administrative problems. We deal seriatim with the different classes of Public Utility Undertakings and suggest some general considerations as to the justification for the distinctions which might be drawn between them.Railways.15. Railways were included within the scope of the original plan as proper subjects for relief, but not as themselves directly productive enterprises. They were included by an extension to them of the underlying principle which brings them in as being a convenient channel for conveying additional relief to industries held to be peculiarly entitled to such relief. Upon this argument railways can be brought within the scheme of derating only upon terms, which terms must be closely related to the fundamental objects of the scheme, namely, the relief of productive industry and agriculture. It follows that reductions of railway charges must be passed on to the whole extent of the relief obtained, and, in so far as possible, to heavy industry where the effect of the relief will be cumulative, and to agriculture which is specially depressed. It has been shown that relief can in fact be conveniently concentrated on certain basic traffics (Appendices III and V).16. It is to be noted that the railways to be included in the scheme upon the principles just indicated can only be the freight-carrying railways, to the exclusion of the purely passenger lines, of which the London Electric Railways are the principal though not the only examples.17. In order to ensure that the whole of the relief obtained by the freight-carrying lines is transmitted to the specified basic traffics, special arrangements will be necessary as a result of the particular form of regulation of charges imposed by the Railways Act, 1921, and of the financial situation of the Railway Companies at the moment. The statutory provisions necessary to define and protect the contemplated arrangement will require careful consideration, for which, however, there is ample time. The Railways Act removed the whole question of railway rates into the jurisdiction of a specially constituted expert body, containing both judicial and commercial elements, to which the distribution of the burden of railway charges among the different classes of traders and of the travelling public is wholly committed. To impose upon this machinery a new arrangement which cuts athwart the principles of the existing jurisdiction is a step not free from difficulty. But the fact that the prospective relief to railway expenditure will result from a fundamental change in public policy appears sufficient to justify the exclusion of the saving to the Railway Companies from the automatic operation of the scheme of adjusting charges to revenue established by the Act and in a similar consideration there may be found justification for not leaving the distribution of the relief to the discretion of the Tribunal. It is also reassuring to find that the four amalgamated Railway Companies and the Metropolitan Railway Company (which carries a small amount of freight traffic) indicated clearly, when they were consulted, that they welcome the general scheme and are prepared to make arrangements (involving a pool to overcome the unequal distribution of the selected traffics on the different systems) so as to secure that the relief would be effectively passed on in the manner desired.18. It is desirable to indicate the arguments which may be adduced against this feature of the scheme. The statutory provisions would be somewhat complicated and would add to the volume of legislation to be faced. Any rigid scheme now enacted must be expected to give rise to difficulties and to need further adjustments as time goes on and industrial conditions change, and the general machinery of the Railways Act, upon which the special provisions will be&apos; superimposed, takes its [17446] a 2Jfactors as well as by the consideration of the effect of derating on rateable value, and the conclusion accepted by the Policy Committee was that no special action need be taken, either in England and Wales or in Scotland, where the rating law is different.
ordinary judicial course. The determination of the amount of the relief which railways would obtain under the scheme will in itself not be an easy matter and in effect it will have to be arrived at by negotiation.19. In the second place, road transport interests, which are adversely affected by other aspects of the plan, will no doubt assert that the de-rating of railways is being carried out at their expense and that they ought not to be taxed in order to assist their competitors to reduce their charges. It can be urged in reply that care has been taken to select, as the recipients of the benefit of reduced charges, heavy and basic traffics, the bulk haulage of which does not or should not pass over the roads. But this answer is not complete, as the fact remains that the railways, as competitive transport undertakings, will be assisted.20. It may also be argued by those trades which will derive no direct benefit from this feature of the scheme, that they are unfairly excluded from participation in the reduction of railway charges, although they bore their share of the increases imposed by the Railway Companies a year ago.21. Lastly, it may be argued that the exemption of the railways from rating and the arrangements (including the pool) for passing the relief are in effect a subsidy to selected industries, and that this result could be obtained more simply and more certainly by a direct subsidy from the Exchequer in the shape of a rebate on railway freights.22. These appear to us to be the arguments which could be set against the advantages of bringing the freight-carrying railways within the scope of the de-rating scheme, so as to confer a special benefit on the heavy industries and agriculture. We have explored the alternative of not de-rating the railways, and its financial implications are discussed below. It suffices here to note that it would still be possible to say to the Railway Companies that they will benefit from the stimulus to industry which the Plan is. designed to give, because their traffic will be increased. Furthermore, they would have the satisfaction of knowing that additional taxation is being imposed upon their competitors to an extent which should go some way towards establishing a better economic balance between rail and road transport. It is presumed, moreover, that if such a decision of policy were taken, it would not be necessary or desirable to state that railways or any other classes of Public Utility Undertakings were permanently excluded from participa-tion in the scheme, but that this matter would always be open to reconsideration as the general scheme of administrative reform came into operation and financial recovery progressed.23. It may be noted that an incidental advantage of the alternative of not de-rating railways would be to avoid claims from the Tube Railways and other passenger-carrying lines and from tramways, which in any case must be left outside the scheme upon the other argument, and the exclusion of which, from the point of view- of rating, will present a certain anomaly.24. In conclusion, we ought perhaps to make the point that the present system of rating railways is anomalous and inequitable, and should in any case be reformed by early legislation. The necessary provisions would find an appropriate place in the legislation required to carry out the scheme.Other Public Utility Undertakings.   (See Appendix XI.)Tramways.25. Since Tramways exist for the conveyance of passengers, it would appear that, on the analogy of the proposal to omit passenger railways from the scope of the relief, tramway undertakings should not be granted relief from local taxation.Water.26. Water might conceivably be held to be a productive enterprise, but it appears to fall more suitably within the class of public services such as drainage
or the cleaning and lighting of the streets. The local taxation borne by water under-takings is thought to amount to about  21 millions to  3 millions a year, and no compensating advantage can be seen for burdening the finances of the scheme by bringing them within its scope.Canals, Docks and Harbours.27. Canals are in direct competition with railways and on this account alone they should receive the same treatment. Moreover, if canals are included in the scheme, it would appear difficult to exclude the more important services to production rendered by docks and harbours. So far as can be estimated, canals pay in local taxation something less than  200.000 a year, and clocks and harbours about  li millions a year.28. It is impossible to ensure that under existing arrangements the-whole of any relief afforded to canals and docks will pass to users. On the other hand, as regards canals, the force of competition with the railways will, it is considered, result in the hulk of the relief passing to the traders who use the canals, especially as a substantial proportion of canal traffics consists of those traffics which have been selected for reductions in the case of the railways. Moreover, under existing powers, it should he possible in some cases for the Minister of Transport to secure a reduction of tolls, as distinct from the charges made by carriers to traders.29. The docks of the country vary from small fishing harbours to the great mercantile ports, and the traffics with which they deal vary greatly from one dock to another. The majority of the docks, including the railway-owned docks, are subject to some form of statutory control, but others, including such important undertakings as the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board and the Manchester Ship Canal, are subject to no effective control for the present purpose. The creation of new, or extension of existing controls designed to ensure the complete passing on of relief would appear unnecessary. The Minister of Transport will, in certain cases, have power to compel the relief to be passed on; in others, the same result will tend to come about, through competition between one clock and another. Moreover, the bulk of the clock and harbour authorities other than the Railway Companies do not work for profit and are largely constituted of ship-owners, merchants and other users whose interest it is to bring about reductions in dues and charges whenever possible.30. Unless it is decided on general grounds to omit Public Utility Under-takings from the scheme, canals, docks and harbours should, we think, be brought within it.Gas and Electricity Undertakings.31. Gas and Electricity Undertakings must receive the same treatment; they are in competition with one another, and the statutory controls to which they are subject are similar in character. As producers they might be thought to have a primd facie claim to relief under the scheme, though, in fact, a substantial proportion of their rateable property is devoted to purposes of distiubution, and a considerable number of the smaller undertakings do not themselves generate the electricity which they distribute. They occupy, however, a special position as sheltered quasi-monopolies. This weakens their case for inclusion from the point of view of the stimulation of productive enterprise. The balance of argument so far points to their exclusion from derating. But it must be remembered that gas and electricity produced on the spot in connection with productive industry would presumably share in the benefit of derating, and, further, a considerable proportion of the receipts of gas undertakings are derived from by-products, produced in direct competition with industries which will be relieved. Gas undertakings pay something over two million pounds a year and electrical undertakings about the same amount, in local taxation.32. It may be added that if gas and electricity undertakings were derated the question would certainly arise hew far the corresponding reductions in expenditure would reach the eonsuiner. Parliament has already laid down provisions designed to regulate the comparative position of shareholders or ratepayers on the one hand and consumers on the other by the control of dividends or prices or both of these undertakings. But as derating would result in a general and sudden reduction of expenditure, a demand would probably arise that the reductions
isshould not be distributed according to existing provisions but that Parliament should take whatever steps might be necessary to secure that the user should get immediately the advantage of the entire relief in all cases. It is desirable to note thai any such legislation supplementing existing law might give rise to unnecessary criticism of present arrangements, quite apart from the exigencies of the present scheme.Coast-wise Traffic.33. The Policy Committee have considered the position of coast-wise shipping in relation to the scheme (Appendix IX). It is apparent that coast-wise traffic interests, as they do not conduct their business on land, will not stand to derive much benefit from the derating of the processes of production, and, therefore, if it be decided to relieve from local taxation the railways, with whom they are in competition, there is a presumption that those interests may complain of unfair treatment.34. It is understood that in the case of bulk cargoes carried for considerable distances the rales charged by coasting vessels are so much lower than the railway rates that the competitive position as between the two interests would probably not be very much affected by any reduction of railway rates that might result from the scheme. In the case of short voyages and of the carriage of general merchandise, the position might be more difficult.35. If the reductions in railway rates were confined to selected heavy traffics, it would appear that few. if any. complaints are likely to arise. Moreover, if the railway reductions were to affect general merchandise, those reductions would have to be spread over all freight traffics, and the rate of reduction would be small; hence, no serious grievance is likely to arise./-&apos; in an c iaI Considera tions.36. If gas and electricity undertakings were excluded from the scheme, but railways, canals and dock and harbour authorities were left within its scope, the sum of  3 million would be set free. That money would suffice to reduce the fixed rate by about one-quarter, or it could be held in reserve to be employed in strengthening the general finance of the scheme. If, however, railways, canals and dock and harbour authorities, which must all be treated on the same footing, were excluded, gas and electricity undertakings would presumably also be excluded. The sum of money thus set free would be  7 million, and the consequential adjust-ments in the finance of the scheme might take one of several forms. The saving would suffice to enable the fixed rate to be abolished without leaving any substantial surplus or deficit. The total abolition of the fixed rate would bring about the same divorce between local industry and local government as the payment of the fixed rate into the Exchequer, to which the Minister of Health sees serious objection. (See Appendix II.) Its effects upon the rating resources of particular areas would be offset by the retention of  12-i million of rates from public utility property in the hands of the local authorities. Since this latter property is in many cases concentrated, e.g., in the great ports, it is likely that some of the more extreme changes will be mitigated in certain areas. This is being further examined. It would also necessitate special consideration of the case of agriculture, which, under the scheme in its original form, is given preferential treatment in two ways. Agriculture will in any case receive complete exemption from rates, whereas other productive industry would under the original proposals receive only partial exemption, and it would also obtain benefit from the proposed reduction of railway rates. The position of the heavy industries, which would also under the original scheme have received benefit from the reduction in railway rates, presents no difficulty in this connection, since the benefit which would be derived from the complete abolition of the fixed rate would compensate them substantially for the loss of the benefit which they would have received from the reduction of railway rates. It might be considered necessary to devise some means of restoring to agriculture the relative advantage which it would lose by this modification of the scheme. Alternatively the money set free could be used to reduce the fixed rate to (say) 4 shillings, and at the same time to lighten the burden of the proposed oil tax, still perhaps leaving something in reserve to strengthen the general finances of the scheme. While we have thought it desirable to state these alternatives, we have not considered it necessary to enter into their respective merits.
II.-DISTRIBUTION OF RELIEF.England and Wales.37. Under the scheme rating authorities will lose a proportion of their, revenue varying from about 4 per cent, to about 70 per cent., and in a large number of areas representing a figure at or about 50 per cent. Such a result would in any event necessitate (Appendix 1) a rearrangement of functions by which those functions involving large and rapidly fluctuating expenditure were transferred to large and financially strong authorities, it is a second basic principle of the scheme that opportunity should be taken to effect certain long overdue reforms in local govern-ment. simultaneously with a radical change in the financial relations between the Exchequer and the local authorities. The reforms proposed involve the concentra-tion in the hands of county and county boroughs of poor law functions and practically all the existing functions of minor local authorities in connection with roads and the substitution for the existing Assigned Revenue grants and for the Ministry of Health (and some part of the Ministry of Transport) percentage grants of a system of block grants calculated upon a formula so constructed as to take account of the general characteristics of the areas concerned. These grants, together with the produce of the remaining local rates, would provide local authorities with the funds required for meeting their obligations in respect of poor law, public health and the main-tenance of local roads.38. The report which forms Appendix VIII deals at length with the question of a block grant, and the conclusion arrived at is that a scheme on the lines there outlined, with such adaptations as fuller knowledge of figures may dictate, offers a practical basis for arrangements with the. local authorities, provided a reasonable amount of new Exchequer money is available, a matter to which we refer in a later paragraph.39. In this connection it is appropriate to refer to Appendix II, dealing with the question whether the fixed rate of 5/- proposed to be left on productive properties, which under the original scheme was to be paid into the Exchequer, should not be retained by local authorities. The Policy Committee have been advised that the negotiations with those authorities would be made much easier if the fixed rate were retained by them. It was represented to the Policy Committee that there are also strong reasons of local government against the entire dissociation of local industry from interest in local finance and the Committee therefore, on balance, came to the conclusion that the fixed rate should be retained by the local authorities.40. It is desirable to point out that the scheme raises questions of very considerable difficulty in regard to local government.41. The total expenditure of local authorities in England and Wales out of rates and Exchequer grants is about  246 millions, of which about  159ms. is from rates and  87ms. from Exchequer grants. Under the scheme this proportion between rates and Exchequer grants will be altered. It may well be that over the country as a whole local authorities will be spending more tax money than rate money, and they will certainly be doing so in numerous areas where the amount of productive property to be derated is large. It is difficult to forecast with any accuracy what the effect of such a position will be on a given local authority. On the one side will be the usual tendency mitigated, however, by the substitution of a grant independent of expenditure for a percentage grant to increase the general rate expenditure when more Exchequer money is available. On the other side will be the fact that the rate on productive properties will be fixed and that the properties remaining fully rated will be those on which increase of rates will cause strong protest.42. A further point to be considered is the effect on the smaller authorities of the transfer of poor law and roads to the counties and county borough councils. This will be more particularly felt in the case of Rural District Councils who are also Boards of Guardians; a very large part of the work done by these bodies is road and poor law work, and it is a question whether, when that work is lost, a considerable reduction in the number of the councils may not have to be made, with the result of
lessened opportunities of public service. Some increase in the number of members of County Councils will probably have to be made, and those Councils will require, for poor law purposes, to set up local committees on which members of existing district councils will have an opportunity of serving. Strong opposition to the scheme must, however, be anticipated from the Rural District Councils. Urban District Councils and non-county boroughs are not poor law authorities, but they will also be concerned in that the scheme transfers to county councils, and not to non-county boroughs and district councils, poor law functions which are now in the hands of guardians in unions centring round the non-county borough or often covering much (he same area as the urban district. The scheme will in fact raise in a very acute form the perennial struggle as to the balance of power in counties between the county council and the Councils of county districts, including some non-county boroughs of considerable size.43. In Appendix VIII, paragraphs 1S-24, a suggestion is made for meeting some, at all events, of the difficulties by means of a system of delegation of poor law functions to non-county boroughs or other county districts. Apart from such a measure of appeasement, the answer to criticism&apos; will be that the scheme must be regarded as a whole in its effect on administration and on local finance, and that on balance its result will be for the good of local government.Scotland.44. As regards Scotland, the effect of the. Scheme, as in England, will be to alter materially the incidence of the cost of Local Government Administration as between rates and taxes. At present about  20 million fall on rates and about  11 million on taxes. Under the Scheme, the corresponding figures will be approxi-mately  14 million and  17 million.45. The reduction in rateable value resulting from derating will probably be confined within slightly narrower limits than in England owing to the fact that the rateable value of sporting subjects (which are not, of course, to be derated) frequently represents a not inconsiderable proportion of the rateable value of rural parishes. So far as returns are available, it would appear that the loss of rateable value in rural areas would be. on the. average, about 40 per cent. It should be stated that, in con-sequence of the difference in the valuation and rating systems in England and Scotland and its effect on rentals, the fixed rate in the hitter country would be less than in England. Thus, a 5/- rate for England would have as its Scottish equivalent a rate of 4/-.46. The scheme will involve a radical rearrangement of the functions of local government authorities, not only as regards poor law and roads, as in England, but also as regards public health. Larger administrative units will be necessary to control these services, and this rearrangement will materially affect the existing powers and duties of parish councils, town councils and county district committees. The burghs which will remain autonomous Will be. few in number, and the others will either be deprived of their autonomy, or, if not now completely autonomous, will be placed under county control to a much greater degree than at present. Many of the burghs to be affected are of great antiquity, and are certain to offer strenuous opposition to what they will regard as a serious infringement of their rights and privileges.47. In such opposition they will have behind them a powerful organisation in the Convention of Royal Burghs. Opposition may also be expected from the other local bodies whose functions will be interfered with.48. It may be possible, by powers of delegation or otherwise, to minimise opposition to some extent, but it is certain to be formidable. The attitude of the authorities will no doubt be affected in some measure if the scheme proves financially attractive.49. The final form of the scheme of Scottish Local Government reorganisation cannot be determined until further financial investigations (which are in progress) have been completed
Contribution of Road Fund.50. Reference is made in paragraph 2 of the Third Interim Report of the Distribution Committee (Appendix VIII) to the proposal that the grants now paid from the Road Fund in respect of the maintenance of &quot;Scheduled&quot; roads in administrative counties and &apos;* Classified &quot; roads in London and the County Boroughs should be merged in the formula distribution along with the existing grants for health services and the various assigned revenue grants. The amount of these Road Fund grants is at present approximately  3 million, and, in the normal course, this figure may be expected to increase considerably during the next few years.New Money.51. It was estimated in the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ Memorandum (CP. 8 (28)) that, in addition to the Exchequer money required to make good the loss of rates, new Exchequer money to the amount of  3 millions would be required to float the scheme. What new money will actually be required cannot be fore-casted till an advanced stage of the negotiations with the local authorities. But the introduction of a system of block grants and the very sweeping changes proposed in the system of local government will render these negotiations delicate and difficult, and it may very well be that considerably more than the  3 millions so far suggested will be needed.III. FINANCE OF SCHEME.52. The question of strengthening the revenue of the country in order to meet the demands upon the Central Government resulting from the scheme as a whole is a matter peculiarly within the province of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is proposed to reinforce the general Revenues of the country by imposing a new duty on certain oils, of which the scope and rate are under consideration. It may be sufficient to mention that a duty of id. per gallon on the lighter oils, including motor spirit and kerosene, would, it is estimated, produce a revenue of  144-m. for the period of 1928-29 during which it would be in force, and  l8-3m. in 1929-30. A duty of Id. per gallon on the heavier oils would, if imposed, yield an additional  l-2m! in both 1928-29 and 1929-30.53. The classes of consumer affected by taxation of this kind may be summarised as follows : (a) Motorists, both private and commercial,(b) Domestic consumers, mainly of kerosene for lighting, heating and cooking, (t-) Farmers using stationary engines and tractors,(d) Fishermen using oil for motor fuel,(e) Other industrial users.54. The incidence of the proposed duty is being examined in the light of ordinary Budget considerations as wrell as in connection with the scheme itself, and the following notes indicate the main points under consideration.55. The motorist is already subject to licence duties, and the question arises whether he should receive any compensation for the additional burden now to be placed upon him by some adjustments in the scale of licence duties. It is estimated that at 4td. a gallon the motoring community as a whole would contribute an additional sum of  13 million on the basis of a full year&apos;s consumption in 1928-29, as compared with an estimated yield of  24-7 million (including the luxury tax) from the existing basis of taxation. Roughly half the sum of  13 million would be paid in respect of commercial goods vehicles, and 15 per cent, in respect of hackney vehicles, i.e., taxicabs, omnibuses and charabancs.56. The use of kerosene for lighting and heating, which is mainly a domestic use but includes.also a substantial quantity used on railways, accounts, it is thought, for about 150 million gallons out of a total annual consumption of 220 million gallons. A tax of 4tf. per gallon in respect of such use would thus represent about  2i million in a full year.[17446] c
57. The consumption of kerosene and motor spirit by farmers in respect of tractors for tillage and stationary engines amounts, it is estimated, to about 45 million gallons a year, representing at 4d. a gallon about  J million a year. The use of the tractors is mainly confined to the arable farms on heavy land, which represent the most depressed section of the agricultural industry. &quot; The general result of the duty must be in many such cases to reduce substantially, and may in some cases offset completely, the relief which the farmer would obtain by ceasing to be liable to local taxation. This point is being considered. The grassland farmer, on the other hand, would be under no such disadvantage.58. The fishing industry, now seriously depressed, is estimated to consume about G  million gallons of oil fuel a year, mostly kerosene, representing, at 4d. a gallon, about  100.000 a year. This question affects Scotland more than England. The fishing industry must, of course, gain little from the scheme as a whole, as their production is not carried out on land, hence the oil tax would represent a burden against which only a small benefit under the scheme could be offset. The Treasury are, therefore, considering whether it will be possible to permit the fishing industry to obtain its oil fuel duty free.59. The use of oil by industry in internal combustion engines is widespread, and as regards the actual use of the lighter oils in manufacture, the paint and cleaning trade would be effected. All these aspects will, however, be weighed by the Treasury as is usual in the case of a large and complicated tax.Conclusion.60. We have not in this Report thought it necessary to rehearse the arguments of general policy which have led to the formulation of this Scheme, but have confined ourselves to balancing its various alternatives and to exploring its serious difficulties and the ways of overcoming or avoiding them. As a Committee of officials we have not attempted to pronounce on the broad issues of Government policy which arise in regard to (a) the depressed state of our basic industries.(b) the continuing burden of unemployment.(c) the problem of the necessitous areas.(d) the reactions which may be produced by the proposed changes in LocalGovernment.(e) the distribution of existing burdens as between rail and road transport.(/) the special position of agriculture in relation to various pronouncements of Government policy.Signed on behalf of the Departmental Committee, JOHN ANDERSON, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, March 26, 1928.

MOST SECRET. P. (28) 5.CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (28)).Annex I.FIRST REPORT OF POLICY PROCEDURE COMMITTEE.APPENDIX I.Second Interim Report of Distribution Sub-Committee.1. IN our First Interim Report (Paper P (28) 3) we stated that on the best judgment which we could form the transfer to the Counties of responsibility for Poor Law and Roads other than streets in towns was an essential part of the Treasury scheme of rating reform as submitted to the Cabinet, but that we were obtaining through the Inland Revenue certain statistical information by which to test the soundness of that judgment. We pointed out that a decision on this point of principle is necessary before we can usefully consider possible formulae for the distribution of the new Exchequer money proposed to be provided under the scheme, in so far as that money is not devoted to direct recoupment to local authorities of the loss of rates thrown on them by the derating of certain classes of properties.2. We have now had the opportunity of studying complete returns prepared by the Inland Revenue for the three administrative Counties of Wiltshire, Monmouthshire and Staffordshire; the first being a rural County, the second containing rural portions as well as areas with a large amount of mining property, and the third containing mining and industrial as well as rural districts.3. We have considered in these counties the extent of the variations in the cost of poor relief and roads in relation to the assessable values of the existing areas of administration as they would be reduced under the scheme. We set ont below a Table showing for the Poor Law Unions and Rural Districts with a high proportion of industrial and agricultural property in the three Counties : (1.) The approximate percentage reduction of assessable value by the exemption of industrial and agricultural property;(2.) The rate in the   on the reduced assessable value equivalent to 1/- in the  on the present assessable value; and (3.) For each of the Poor Law Unions the equivalent rates in the   on the presentand reduced assessable value of an expenditure of 5/- per head of population.In order to present as true a picture of the position as possible, we have in the ease of each County selected only those Unions which are wholly within the administrative County.

It will be seen that the loss of assessable value in the Unions varies from 31 per cent, to 55 per cent.; while for rural districts, which mostly differ from the Unions in not including an urban area, the percentage of loss runs to 67-4 per cent. In the extreme cases the reduced assessable value on which would be charged any future increase in the cost of the services in question would be less than 40 per cent, of the present assessable value.5. The approximate percentage loss of assessable value for the Counties as a whole is : Wiltshire, 30 per cent. ; Monmouthshire, 36-9 per cent.; Staffordshire, 37-4 per cent.6. In the case of the relatively few Unions of the Country which are purely rural in character, fluctuations of expenditure between one year and another are, on the whole, small, and in most cases, therefore, these Unions would probably be able to carry on their services if assisted by a deficiency grant corresponding to the loss of rates resulting from the scheme. &quot;But it would be impossible in practice to segregate these unions, and in the vast majority of unions which are mainly or partly industrial in character variations in the. cost of Poor Relief may be considerable. In the Unions shown in the Table above there was a considerable increase between 1924-25 and 1925-26 in only one case, but, comparing the accounts of the Guardians for the country as a whole for the years 1924-25 and 1925-26, we find that increases
in the cost of Poor Relief in the course of one year in a number of Unions exceeded &apos;2/(Jd. per head of population, and that in about one-half of the same Unions the increase varied from 5/- to over  1 per head of population.7. It will be seen from the above Table that increases in the cost of Poor Relief of of- per head of population in Unions similar to those for which particulars are given would require a rate of about I /- in the   on the present assessable value, and that under the proposed scheme very burdensome increases of rates would be involved. Where the. increased cost approached 10/- per head the rate required would be pro-hibitive. Moreover, in estimating the burdensome effect of such increases levied over areas of the size of the present Unions, it should be borne in mind that the ability of the area to pay its rates would be very seriously impaired by the same causes which had led to the increase in the burden. With a considerable proportion of the popula-tion out of work, rents and rate payments would fall into arrear and shopkeepers would be unable to secure prompt payment of their accounts. Even under the present rating system, the system of financing Poor Law over the Union area has well-nigh broken down in certain parts of the Country; the undesirable expedient of borrowing for current requirements has been necessary, and we can see no escape from the con-clusion that, under the proposed scheme, the situation in some, cases would be an impossible one unless the area of charge were greatly extended.8. Very similar considerations arise in the case of the highways. It is true that in this case there is not the further effect of reduction in the ability of the area to meet its charges as those charges increase noted above in the case of Poor Law expenditure, and the variation of charge from one year to another does not run to such extreme, figures as in the case of poor relief. But the variations are, neverthe-less, very considerable and the loss of assessable value in the Rural Districts is sub-stantially greater than in Unions. As will be seen from the following Table, in which the. rate-borne expenditure on district roads for some of the rural districts in the three Counties for 1924-25 and 1925-26 are compared, the increased cost would, on the reduced rateable value, represent a serious burden on Rural areas.Rural District Councils.Rural District.

9. We realise that the transfer of Poor Law and district roads to the Counties would, in many cases, involve an increase in the existing rate burden on some areas of the County to the advantage of other areas. This would be especially marked in the Counties which are largely agricultural in character where, owing to the present relatively heavy expenditure on district roads in rural areas, these areas would benefit substantially at the expense of the urban areas. The grant of new-Exchequer money to the County as a whole would, in any case, go some way to avoid an increase on the rate burden, and one object to be borne in mind in any scheme of distribution of the Exchequer grants generally would be to correct as far as possible widespread changes in the incidence of rates.10. We conclude accordingly that if the Treasury scheme is to be adopted as it stands, transfer of Poor Law and roads, except streets in towns, to Counties will be found inevitable. Should such a transfer be ruled out on political grounds, and the organisation of local government be left broadly as it now is, we think that the distribution of new Exchequer money on any general characteristics formula would present difficulties so serious that it would be impossible to surmount them, and that it would be necessary to search for a scheme radically differing from the present Treasury scheme.11. In our First Interim Ileport we stated that we were advised that in the ease of Scotland it was not proposed in any case to make any change in the existing Poor Law arrangements. Figures have been obtained for Scotland indicating the effect of the proposed scheme of derating on the finances of Scottish local authorities. We understand that, in the view of the Scottish Office, the result of the figures is to indicate that if the Treasury scheme is to be brought into effect, it will be necessary in Scotland, as in England and Wales, to introduce a reorganisation of local govern-ment with the object of transferring responsibility for Poor Law not necessarily to the Counties, but to local authorities covering wider areas and with larger financial resources than the authorities on whom these responsibilites are at present placed. A similar question will arise as regards certain of the public health functions presently administered by the smaller local authorities, and as regards roads. The question of important changes in local government accordingly arises on the Treasury scheme in Scotland, as well as in England and Wales.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee.W. A.

SECRET.P. (28) 6.CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (28)).Annex I.FIRST REPORT OF POLICY PROCEDURE COMMITTEE.APPENDIX LIFIXED  RATE TO BE LEVIED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES  ANDPROCEEDS TO GO TO THEM.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.THE Second Interim Report of the Distribution Committee confirms the fears which I had previously entertained as to the very serious effect of the Treasury rating reform scheme on the assessable values on which local authorities are at present able to base their finances. The figures in the Report indicate that the result of the proposed derating would be to destroy assessable value for rating purposes in many areas by considerably more than one half in extreme cases by nearly three-fourths. The transfer to the Counties of responsibility for the poor law and for roads other than streets in towns would doubtless prevent violent fluctuations in the liabilities falling from year to year on local authorities other than the Counties, but it would leave these authorities receiving in many cases more of their income from the Exchequer than from their proper financial resources; and when account is taken of the large Exchequer grants now paid to Counties and County Boroughs, it would seem certain that the same position -would arise in the case of many of those authorities.The Treasury scheme proposes that the new Exchequer money, other than such part of it as is required to make good actual deficiencies of rates, should be paid as a block grant, and it has been one of the features in my proposals for such a grant that it should be accompanied by a relaxation of that close control of details to which local authorities take exception in regard to percentage grants. The position would therefore be that in many of the large areas the bulk of the money spent by the local authorities would come from the Treasury, and central control would at the same time be loosened. It seems to me that such a position would involve serious dangers to sound local government.There is the further point to be remembered that the present proposals are devised to help the producing industries, but that, in the process of defining what these are, it has been necessary to include the railways among the properties to be derated. The railways bring in the factor of distribution, and it is easy to forecast strong pressure to extend the scope of the scheme to purely distributing agencies such as shops. It is well within the range of possibility that such a step might be taken as an incident to the political controversies of the future. If so, I apprehend that in many areas the result would be that all but a very small proportion of the expenditure would be from the Exchequer, and the result must be the ruin of local government.Considerations such as these have given the Ministry of Health grave cause for anxiety and have led me, whilst strongty supporting the principle of the Treasury scheme, to suggest that for reasons of local government the exemption from rates on the selected properties should be partial and not total.I should have preferred that this should apply to agricultural land and buildings as well as to manufactories, but as the farmers have already been relieved to the extent [1744GI d
of three-quarters of their rates on these properties, I don&apos;t know that there is much to be gained by splitting up what remains. The position of the manufacturers, however, is quite different, and in my view the case against total exemption is over-whelming, lean well appreciate the difficulty which the Chancellor finds in accepting this view. It would impair the logical basis of the scheme. It would imply the retention of varying rates on producers. It only mitigates, but does not get rid of, the vicious circle in the areas of industry reduction of output, more unemployment  heavier rates further reduction of output further unemployment, &amp;c. Moreover, the experience with agriculture shows that when once partial exemption has been given it is difficult to arrest its further progress.Accordingly, I have been considering whether there was any other way in which my difficulties could be overcome without raising new ones for the Chancellor, and I turn to his proposal that a fixed National rate of 5s. in the pound of assessable value should remain leviable on the properties to be derated, the proceeds to be paid into the Exchequer in support of the finance of the scheme. This fixed rate would bo temporary only and would be levied only on existing and not on uew properties. In our discussions a difference of opinion has developed as to whether it would in fact be practicable to confine the fixed rate to existing properties. If it is not so practicable, the whole process of assessment of properties must be continued; and I believe it will lie found that that process must in any event be continued as long as the fixed rate continues, in order to enable periodical re-assessment of grants to be made after the end of the first period of grants. The suggestion that 1 now wish to make is that, while retaining the principle of a fixed rate on the full assessable value of the selected classes of properties, we should provide that the proceeds of this rate should go, not to the Exchequer, but to the local authorities by which it would be levied.It will be seen 1. That this suggestion maintains all that is claimed for the &quot;plan&quot; as outlined on the first page of CP. 8 (28); 2. That it would reduce the claims of local authorities in respect of that partof the new Exchequer grant which will be required to compensate themfor loss of power to expand rates; 3. It would be a&apos; rough and ready way of asserting the principle that theconcerns benefited by the scheme should make some payment for local services;4. It would to some extent at all events contribute to maintain business interestin local government; and 5. It would most certainly ease the difficult negotiations which we shall have to face with local authorities, especially in considering the basis on whichthe grant for the second 5 years shall be calculated.The fixed rate would naturally be the subject of discussion between the Ministry of Health and the Local Authorities at each revision of the block grant. It need not necessarily always be 5s. but it will always be the same for the whole country, so that manufacturers will not be handicapped in competing with one another, and it would obviously be to the advantage of the country that there should be some elasticity about this charge which could, when desired, be manipulated to assist industry in competition with the foreigner.N.

SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (28)).Annex I.FIRST REPORT OF POLICY PROCEDURE COMMITTEE.APPENDIX III. THE SCHEME AND RAILWAY RATES.First Report of Departmental Committee.1. WE were appointed as a Departmental Committee under Conclusion 6 (2) of the meeting of the Policy Committee held on the 25th January, 1928, and we have considered the situation that will arise if, under the general scheme, railways are granted certain reliefs from their existing burden of local taxation. We have assumed for the purposes of this enquiry that railways will be required to pass on to users the whole of the relief so given. The object of this report is to discuss the question of which railway charges shall be reduced as a consequence of the relief from rates, and to make suggestions as to the machinery that will be necessary tQ carry out the scheme of reductions which may be chosen. We desire at the outset to emphasise that the nature of the arrangements to be made cannot finally be settled until the Ministry of Transport has had an opportunity of discussing this aspect of the matter with the companies concerned.2. Position in 1927. In 1927 the Railway Companies of Great Britain paid in local rates in respect of railway working a total sum, approximately  7-i- million, equivalent to rather less than 4 per cent, of their total receipts from passenger fares and freight traffic. Of this sum about 95 per cent, was paid by the four amalgamated companies. In Appendix &quot; A &quot; are shown the amounts paid in respect of the four amalgamated railways and other important companies, with the percentages which the payments bear to the total traffic receipts and freight traffic receipts respectively. It will be observed that, owing to variations in the proportions of the receipts of the several companies derived from freight and passenger train traffic respectively, the percentage which their payments of local rates bears to their receipts from freight train traffic differs materially as between the four amalgamated companies, especially as between the Southern Railway and the others.   A number of the smaller companies have no freight traffic.3. The following tables give the amounts and varying proportions of total receipts derived from passenger and freight traffic respectively by the four amalgamated companies and sub-divide freight train receipts as between &quot; General Merchandise,&quot; &quot; Coal, Coke and Patent Fuel,&quot; and &quot; Other Minerals,&quot; the main divisions of freight traffic.1927.

Further, it is the case that a larger proportion of the coal carried on the Southern Railway is destined for domestic purposes than on the other lines.4. Assumed Position under Scheme. It is assumed that the whole of the sums paid by the Railway Companies in respect of local rates will not be remitted. Certain properties will continue to be assessed and rated and allowance has to be made for the national levy. These factors are taken for the purposes of this memorandum as accounting for two-fifths of the amounts paid in local taxation, but it will be necessary to obtain more detailed information as to existing assess-ments. We show, therefore, in Appendix A not only the percentages which the whole of the payments of local rates bear to the freight receipts of the various railways, but also similar percentages substituting three-fifths for the whole of the rate payments. It will be seen that on the three-fifths basis for 1927 the total sum in respect of which the railways would be relieved amounts to nearly  4-i millions,* of which the four big lines account for just over  4 millions. On the same basis the percentage of rate relief to freight receipts for all the companies .named is 4, and the percentage in the case of the Southern Railway is more than twice as great as in the case of the Great Western Railway and about three times as great as in the case of the remaining two big lines.Scope of Reductions.5. The first question to be considered is the nature of the traffics in respect of which charges shall be lowered in return for the relief from local taxation to be accorded.   The relief might be distributed over (a.) All railway charges, including passenger fares as well as charges for the conveyance of goods. (b.) All freight traffics, but not passenger fares.(c.) All freight trallics, with a statutory direction that preference shall be givento certain selected classes of goods. (d.) Selected classes of goods exclusively.6. All Railway Charges. It is shown in Appendix A that on the three-fifths basis the percentage of rates to all traffic receipts was 2-2 in 1927. It is suggested that such a relief, spread equally over all traffics, would provide little or no stimulus to any of the traffics affected. Moreover, if, as is understood, the principal object of the scheme now under consideration is to stimulate industrial production directly, the inclusion of passenger fares would not promote that object.7. All Freight Traffics. If passenger fares were excluded and the relief spread over all freight trallics as equally as possible, the reduction, as shown in Appendix A, would represent an average of 4 per cent, on the basis of 1927. How far such an all-round reduction would stimulate production is difficult to forecast; the effect might be appreciable in some cases. On the other hand, such a reduction would fall short of restoring the general level of railway freight charges to the point at which they stood a year ago, when they were increased by approximately hi per cent.8. It may be added that when this increase was made, traders represented that the traffics in which they were interested would be badly hit. Judging from the representations which were made at the time, a 4 per cent, reduction should be welcomed.* Note. This tigure has been mollified as a result of further investigation, the results of which are sot out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Departmental Oominitteo&apos;s Second Report, P. (28) 11, Appendix V.
0. All Freights, with Preference for Selected Goods. This plan is attractive at lirst sight, as it would give all goods some advantage, whilst at the same time affording additional advantages to selected industries. But it is apparent that if certain traffics were selected for favourable treatment, the relief given to other traffics must be below the average reduction of 4 per cent, which would result from spreading the relief over all traffics equally. Thus, taking the main divisions of the railway traffic, it is found that on the basis of 1927 a 4 per cent, reduction on all freight traffics would be about equivalent in cost to the following graduated scale of reductions : Per Cent.Coal, coke and patent fuel   ... ... ... other minerals      ... ... ... ... general merchandise and live-stock   ... ... 2The effect of reducing the charges on any class of goods by so small a percentage as 2. would be. in our opinion, negligible in stimulating production. Hence, as this would be an inevitable feature of any such plan, we cannot recommend its adoption.10. Selected Traffics. The greatest stimulus to Trade and Industry will be given if the relief is concentrated on a few products of widespread and basic importance to industry generally. Provided that a selection can be made by reference to broad considerations which will provide an effective answer to be given when attempts are made to dissipate the advantages of the relief by its extension to other commodities, this kind of scheme appears to offer the maximum advantage.11. General Considerations. We suggest, therefore, that in making a selection, the following considerations should be kept in view :  (&apos;/.) The commodities selected should be sufficiently few in number to ensure asubstantial reduction in freights. (b.) The commodities should be products of basic importance to. and used mostwidely by. industry generally throughout the country, (c.) The commodities should, if possible, themselves be products of basic industries employing large masses of the population. (d.) The reductions should favour home as against foreign production.12. The. first three considerations need no comment except that, if the relief can be confined to pioducts of the widest use in industry, an answer will be afforded to those who press the claims of industries whose products, though highly important, cannot be said to enter comprehensively into the industrial life of the nation.13. As regards the fourth consideration, any attempt at specific discrimina-tion in favour of home products would seriously complicate the working of a scheme which, as will be. seen later, cannot be simple. Apart from this, the trend of our inter-national obligations with regard to transport by rail is against the use of railway tariffs as a means of discriminating against foreign products, and this country would be liable to be taken to arbitrationhy foreign States. It will, however, be shown that it is possible to make selection in such a way that the great bulk of the relief will go to home products, and that the balance will go for the most part to products the importation of which is essential to British industry.14. Before we discuss in detail the particular commodities which might most advantageously be selected, it will be advisable to indicate shortly certain implications-tions of the adoption of the policy of concentration of relief. ,15. It has been shown that if the reduction were spread equally over all freight charges, the percentage by which the Southern Railway could reduce its rates would be about twice as great as in the case of the Great Western and about three times as great as in the case of the other two big railways. Limitation of the relief to selected basic traffic would increase this inequality owing to the comparatively small propor-tion of such traffics carried by the Southern Railway:10. It will, however, be important, and both Railway Companies and Traders are likely to take the same view, that, so far as practicable, any relief in respect of rail charges should be so distributed as to avoid prejudicing traders in one part of the country as compared with their competitors in another part, and also to avoid prejudicing the standard revenue of any of the amalgamated companies by bringing
about a substantial transfer of traffic from that company&apos;s system to the system of another company. The only means of reconciling a policy of concentrating relief on basic traffics with an equal distribution of the relief to traders would appear to be the constitution of a Pool towards which each Railway Company should contribute a sum equivalent to the amount by which it had been relieved from local taxation and out of which each would be compensated for the reduction in its charges.17. If the institution of a Pool is ruled out, the only alternative would be to leave the selection of the traffics to be benefited to the Railway Rates Tribunal&quot; with some statutory directions as to the traffics to which they should accord priority of relief. Otherwise they would almost inevitably be driven, owing to conflict of interests, so to broaden the basis of reduction that the advantages to industry might well be dissipated. In order, however, to meet the special circumstances of the Southern Railway, the Tribunal would have to be left free to extend some relief, if necessary, to passenger traffic.18. Classes of Selected Traffics. It is assumed that the reductions to be marie under any selected list should cover both industrial and agricultural traffics.19. industrial Traffics. Taking first industrial traffics, the Board of Trade suggest that the relief might be confined to the following classes of goods : (1.) Coal.(2.) Mining timber.(3.) Ironstone, iron ore and manganese ore. (4.) Iron and steel scrap.(5.) Limestone for blast furnaces and steel works.20. It is considered that this list best complies with the principles we have laid down in a preceding paragraph. The relief would be concentrated on two industries which are of basic importance throughout British industry and which are seriousby depressed. Moreover, a reduction in cost, while helpful generally, would be of special assistance to two other large industries General Engineering and Ship-building which have also experienced a prolonged depression.21. The extension of the relief beyond this limited list would appear to raise very difficult questions of delimitation. The most probable suggestion would be the inclusion of pig iron, which is used either in the production of steel or for the manu-facture of wrought iron or light castings. But, so far as it is used in the manufacture of steel, (a) it is rarely carried any considerable distance by rail, and (b) in modern iron and steel works the production of pig iron is rather a stage in the production of steel than an end in itself, and is so treated. If the reductions extended to pig-iron for the wrought iron and light casting works for which it is a raw material, it is felt that it would not be easy to defend the exclusion of steel blooms, billets and bars, which are the material of the rolling-mills, or of Swedish bar iron for the tool steel makers of Sheffield, or tin-plate bars for the tin-plate industry of South Wales, or wire rods for the wire makers of the Midlands. Again, the inclusion of materials for other industries, e.g., copper, rubber, wool all of importance, but none of such widespread use as those recommended for relief would make it extremely difficult to resist demands for additions to the list, until the Avhole range of materials had been included.22. Domestic Coal. The question arises whether the relief should extend to coal for domestic consumption. We are not in a position to express a conclusive opinion on the practicability of discriminating between industrial and domestic coal. But if, on grounds of policy, it were decided to be desirable, it is one of the questions which the Ministry of Transport would need to discuss with the Railway Companies. It is estimated that in 1927 domestic use accounted for  7i millions out of the total receipts from coal traffic amounting to  37A millions.23. The advantages of including domestic coal within the scheme of relief would be (a.) That the relief would cover all coal. This is qualified by the consideration that the reduction on industrial coal alone would be slightly higher than on all coal.
(b.) That ii might ease the practical problem of dealing with the Southern Railway, the freight receipts of which are, in any case, much lower than those of the other three big Railways, and which carries a much greater proportion of domestic to industrial coal as compared with the other lines.(c.) London and the South of England might feel that they were getting more out of the scheme.24. The arguments against the inclusion of domestic coal may be put as follows: (a.) Whilst its inclusion might help the coal industry, the reduction of charges on domestic coal would not in itself help industry generally.(b.) The Mines Department are against the inclusion of domestic coal on the ground that under the present organisation of distribution it is unlikely that any appreciable reduction of cost of carriage would accrue to the consumer.(c.) On the assumption that coal used by gas and electricity undertakings would share in the relief, any encouragement given to the use of gas and electricity for domestic fuel purposes instead of raw coal would be to the national advantage.25. Our conclusion is in favour of omission, provided that it is practicable. Thus, on this assumption, the relief would be given to coal, including coke and patent fuel, destined for industrial purposes, for bunkers and for export. It is a matter for consideration whether the reductions in rates should be confined to coal carried in large consignments. This question might be referred in clue course to the Standing Committee on Mineral Transport, of which Sir Arthur Duckham is the Chairman.26. If the suggested list were adopted, the relief would be confined substantially to the carriage of British products. The exceptions would be, firstly, manganese ore, which is not produced in this country, but which is essential to the general steel industry: secondly, mining timber, the bulk of which must be brought from abroad; and thirdly, imported iron ore. This moves mainly to works on or near the coast, and in any event the foreign ore is essential to the British industry. It may be noted that the extension of the relief to steel blooms, billets, bars, &amp;c, would bring within its scope a large importation of foreign material.27. We feel with some hesitation that iron and steel scrap might be included in the interests of the steel industry. The foreign element is small, it is collected from all parts of the country, and it forms most important material for steel manufacture. On the other hand, it would seem difficult to leave out pig iron and include iron and steel scrap.The above are our present conclusions as to the materials for the iron and steel industry to be included in the selected list, but we think it most desirable that the matter should be discussed confidentially by the Board of Trade with Sir William Larke, the Director of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers.28. Agricultural Traffics. We turn now to the Agricultural traffics. The following list has been prepared for consideration by the Ministry of Agriculture, who also think it most desirable that the industry should be confidentially consulted : (1.) Manures and fertilisers, including raw material. (2.) Feeding-stuffs for live-stock. (3.) Live-stock.(4.) Beetroot for sugar making. (5.) Milk. (6.) Grain.(7.) Potatoes (excluding new potatoes).29. It will be observed that the first three items represent the nearest analogy to the basic materials recommended for relief in the sphere of industry, and that the remaining four represent finished products of the agricultural industry. The Ministry of Agriculture have put forward the list as a whole in order to cover as many types of agricultural industry as possible. The Scottish Board of Agriculture are understood to favour a shorter list, comprising manures and fertilisers, feeding-
stuffs, live-stock and agricultural drain pipes. This list can. in their view, be justified on the principle that all these articles will increase the fertility of the soil, and they consider that there is the greatest prospect in these cases that the farmer will get the benefit of the reduced freights. The Scottish Board press for the inclusion of agricultural drain pipes, which are of special importance for improve-ment purposes at the present time, and which are quite distinguishable by material and construction from the drain pipes used by builders.30. As a Committee whose duty it is to regard the problem as a whole, we should deprecate the inclusion within the scope of relief of items which cannot be defended on the similar grounds to those included in the industrial list. For this reason alone we should greatly prefer to concentrate upon manures, feeding stuffs and live-stock, which cover between them the needs of agriculturists generally and, in addition, of the market gardener, the horticulturist and the poultry-keeper.31. We see this further difficulty in the inclusion of the finished products mentioned, as at first sight it would seem impossible to resist the inclusion of additional items. A claim would certainly be made for eggs. If potatoes are included, why not other vegetables, and, if all vegetables, why not fruit? The difficulty of discriminating in favour of home produce woidd at once arise in the case of grain, and the same difficulty would arise if eggs were brought within the relief.32. We understand that the Ministry of Agriculture and the Scottish Office have considered the case for including Fish, but do not consider its inclusion necessary having regard, inter alia, to the relief that the stream fishing industry will obtain from any reduction in coal freights.of thepercentage reduction in traffic rates represented by the various schemes; and (c) the distribution of relief between Tnclustrv and Agriculture :      8.(100,000 7,500,00033.

Machinery.34. The next question for consideration is the nature of the arrangements to be made for carrying out the plan of reduction that may be selected. We propose to discuss this in the first place from the point of view of the four amalgamated companies which are subject to the full rigour of the Railways Act, 1921. The other Railways throw up different problems which will be discussed later in the Report.35. Position under the Railways Act, 1921. The first point to be made is, that failing some arrangement to the contrary, the relief from local taxation would not pass to the users in the ordinary course. The position is that under the Act above quoted the Railway Rates Tribunal has determined the amounts of the respective Standard Revenues of the Railways in question and has also fixed charges which came into operation on the 1st January last. In theory the charges authorised should, together with other sources of revenue, yield the Standard Revenues. In fact, these charges, although as high as was considered economic, are unlikely in the near future to vield the full Standard Revenue of some, or possibly any, of the Companies.

If the Act were left to operate automatically, a reduction in the Companies&quot; expenditure due to the proposed relief would go to reduce any deficiency in earnings as compared with Standard Revenue, and to that extent would benefit only the shareholders. In so far as a surplus over Standard Revenue was produced, the Company under the Act would be entitled to retain one-fifth of the surplus hy way of addition to Standard Revenue, the remaining four-fifths being applied in reduction of charges as the Tribunal might determine. Other things being equal, it would be open to railways to argue that any reductions in expenditure should enure to their benefit as a part of the bargain incorporated in the Act of 1921. But it may be contended that there is no reason why in the case of a windfall of this kind the relief should not be diverted from the normal channels and applied to such objects as the Government ma)r determine in pursuance of general policy. The alternative would appear to be, not the strict application of the Act, but the exclusion of the railways from the general scheme.37. Necessity for Statutory Intervention. It might be argued that legislation to divert the whole of the relief to the. users could be avoided by an understanding with the Companies to reduce their charges equivalently. But even if the Companies were willing to enter into an agreement of this kind, the general position would be very difficult, as the charges made by the Railways are hedged around with all kinds of safeguards in the interests of traders, of the position of the Railways one with another, and of such competitive, concerns as coastwise shipping and canals. Appeals under all these heads lie to the Railway Rates Tribunal, and it is clear that that body would be deluged with appeals and that the intentions of the Government might be negatived unless the arrangement were protected by Statute.38. Machinery. Coming now to the question of the actual machinery for ensuring that the relief is passed on to the users, it is obvious that its nature must depend upon the plan of reduction selected. If, for example, both passenger and freight traffic were to share in the relief, a glance at the table in Appendix A shows that the Tribunal would have no difficulty in distributing over the traffic of each Railway reductions in rates and fares equivalent in value to the amount by which[17446] e
2Gthat Railway had been relieved from local taxation. But as soon as any other plan is considered, it is equally obvious that the Tribunal would have at the best con-siderable difficulty in appropriating to the traffic of each Railway the amount of its relief. The proportion of the relief from local taxation to the freight receipts of the Southern Railway would be two or three times as great as in the case of the other three Railways, and the existing relativity of the traffic rates as between the Com-panies would tend to be upset. The task would be, indeed, troublesome were the amount involved to be distributed over all freight traffic, but it would become well-nigh impossible if the reductions were directed to a few selected traffics, especially as the Southern Railway carries proportionately far less of the traffics suggested for selection than the other lines. In fact, it would appear that on this basis it would be impossible not to allow the Tribunal, whilst giving a preference to selected traffics, to go oeyond them and, in the case of the Southern Railway, to extend the reductions to other freights, and indeed to passenger fares.As we have already indicated in paragraphs 14 to 17, the only way out of these difficulties would be to set up a Statutory Pool which might be controlled by the Railway Rates Tribunal.39. Position of Southern Railway under Pool. The Southern Railway might protest that not only was it not enabled to reduce charges to the full amount by which it was relieved from local rates, but that it was actually being made to hand over a part of that relief for the indirect benefit of the. other lines, and in these representa-tions they might have the support of those who use that line. It remains, however, true that the Southern Railway should obtain some benefit from increased traffic following reduced freights. Their inclusion in the plan for disrating railways is essential to a comprehensive scheme for the reduction of railway rates throughout the country, and in no other way but by means of a Pool does it appear possible to ensure that the same, kind of traffic gets the same treatment on the four lines.40. Pool Machinery. It is not proposed at this stage to attempt to set out particulars of the way in which a pool could be worked under the direction of the Railway Rates Tribunal. We suggest that the Ministry of Transport should be asked at the earliest possible date to discuss confidentially with the Companies the best means of carrying out whatever plan of reduction in railway rates the Government may favour. These discussions would cover the necessity for a Pool as Avell as details, and the object would be to get an agreed scheme.Other Railways.41. There remain for consideration a variety of smaller railways, which give rise to many complications as a result of their widely differing economic circum-stances, and the varying forms of statutory control to which they are subject.42. In the first place, there are a number of joint lines, some of them of importance, which are owned by two or more of the amalgamated companies. These lines might well be brought within the scope of a Pool.43. Next, there are a large number of light railways throughout the country. These are mainly small and struggling concerns. In so far as they are not industrial, they run through agricultural areas, and anything which would contribute to their efficiency is to be welcomed. It would be possible, if desired, to require such lines to submit to the Ministry of Transport, or the Railway Rates Tribunal, a scheme of reduction in freight charges which would satisfy the&apos; prescribed authority as being calculated to pass on the relief from disrating to their users, and it might further be provided that any increase in such rates should be made only with corresponding approval.  This is a matter which requires further detailed consideration.44. Another group of railways consists of railway lines owned by Dock authorities, such as the Manchester Ship Canal and the Port of London. It is thought that the simplest course would be to treat such lines as part of the general dock undertaking and not to attempt to isolate the relief to the railway properties as such. This matter can be further considered in connection with the treatment of dock and harbour undertakings.IWWI WHIM m ttmmtM MlM yUmUM HaiMlMMtnilMWMlOlilillMI HWlHWIft MfclllW THnni-HI mtftM HlflTlllllMiiiHl MUlMMlHll IIMiiaWlllMIII IIIIIIIWll-M^llMMiimiH MJUlWKIilMUllil
45. Finally, the lines which carry only passengers or very little freight traffic present special difficulties. We have not proceeded to investigate this problem further for the moment, as we feel that its solution is largely dependent upon the decision as to the treatment of the Southern Railway.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,( H.

(28) 8.CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (2S)).Annex I.FIRST REPORT OF POLICY PROCEDURE COMMITTEE.APPENDIX IV.PROPOSED EXEMPTION OF NEW INDUSTRIAL PROPERTYFROM RATES.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I AM strongly opposed to the suggested exemption of new industrial under-takings from the flat tax to be imposed, for an indefinite period, on existing undertakings, for the reasons set out briefly below : (i.) It would differentiate unfairly between new and old enterprises. Under-takings which had carried on through a period of great trade depression, often under severe financial strain, and had in some instances run the risk entailed by substantial capital expenditure upon extensions desirable in the interests of greater efficiency of production, would have good ground for complaint if they were left with a burden from which firms with no such record were free. Where, as would undoubtedly happen, the old and new undertakings were in competition in the same market this applies not only to manufactures, but also to the supply of public services (gas and electricity) the effect of the discrimination would be to give to one competitor by State action a material and continuing advantage over another. A newcomer into industry could have no possible grievance in being placed on exactly the same terms as existing concerns (especially as those terms -would be far more favourable than any hoped for hitherto), whilst, with the proposed exemption of new undertakings, the existing ones would have a grievance, the validity of which could not be seriously denied. Under the Trade Facilities Act, much criticism was encountered, on the ground that one firm obtained an advantage over another. The most difficult and most criticised case was the guarantee to the Appleby Iron and Steel Company. If new businesses or extensions are to be exempt from the national rate the criticism will be even stronger, and will be universal.(ii.) In many businesses to-day complete or partial renewal of plant is badly needed. The normal process of renewal was retarded by the war and afterwards by the uncertainty of the future, high prices, the cost of capital and, eventually, by trade depression. This renewal of plant, which will increasingly take place as trade improves, will naturally be accompanied by modernisation of methods and associated with reconstruction in a number of cases. Nobody would deny that in different degrees such reorganisation of existing undertakings is widely needed. But the proposal to exempt new enterprises from the flat rate would do nothing to assist it, and would, in fact, retard it. It would simply induce some existing businesses to start new branches and outside capitalists to establish entirely new enterprises, and, as a result, the reorganisation and re-equipment of the old enter-prises would tend to be checked, in the first place, because the old firms would feel doubtful about the future, in view of the competition of the new businesses, and, in the second place, because it would be found difficult to obtain capital for investment which did not share in the benefit of exemption from the flat rate, as capital would naturally be attracted to the enterprises which enjoyed this benefit, and had,
therefore, better prospects. It would, in fact, be impossible to resist the demand that would certainly be made for the exemption of replacement plant, or of such parts of existing works as are reconstructed.The result would be at every revaluation an increased number of exemptions from the flat rate tax. Its yield would be less, and, therefore, presumably, it would be retained longer, thus adding to the injustice inflicted on the older firms. The only fair course is to impose it all round, add reduce it all round as money becomes available from other sources.(iii.) It has been suggested that rates form a heavier burden on new factories than on old, but in fact a new factory does not pay rates until it begins manufacture, and, when it does begin, it is presumably likely to make money at once; it will at any rate have been built on that assumption. The burden is in present circumstances normally much heavier in the older factories.(iv.) It might be thought that, though in the depressed industries the proposal would have unfortunate consequences, yet in the flourishing and expanding industries at least, its consequences would be the exact opposite. This, however, is not necessarily so. There are certain new industries to-day which are in a very active state, but already there are signs of the speculation which so frequently follows on rapid and apparently successful development. Consequently, it would seem to be unwise to put such a premium on expansion as is suggested. They are in a state in which there would be immediate response to this encouragement of new enterprises, if not through the agency of people already in the business, at any rate through the agency of outside speculative financiers. Since the war the country has had experience of what an excessive boom fostered by company promoters, who seize the opportunity to snatch a fortune, means eventually to the investing public and to the industry itself. More than one industry to-day is still suffering from a recent experience of this kind. The suggested exemption from the flat rate may seem too small an advantage to have any large effect of this kind, but, given a tendency to speculation, any additional inducement will strengthen it, and it would be unfortunate if it could be said that any State action had contributed to it.(v.) So long as any national flat rate tax is imposed, new businesses should contribute to the public services they require. New factories mean houses, water, streets, light, &amp;c. The local authority and the Exchequer must provide these. Why should not the new businesses contribute, so long as businesses in general have to do so?Summary. The proposal put forward has then serious disadvantages. In the first place, it would discriminate unfairly against old enterprises and in favour of new enterprises which would compete with them. Secondly, in certain industries the reconstruction and modernisation of existing undertakings which is urgently needed would be discouraged and in place of it new enterprises would be.established which are not needed. Thirdly, the new businesses in general feel the burden of rates less than the old. yet only the new are to be exempted. Fourthly, there would be a risk of an unhealthy boom in the new industries for which consolidation of the position gained may be at present more important than further rapid expansion. And, lastly, new factories, unlike old. would contribute nothing to the services which they themselves make necessarj7.P. C.-L.Board of Trade, March 8, 1928.
MOST SECRET. P. (28) 11.CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (28)).Annex I.FIRST REPORT OF POLICY PROCEDURE COMMITTEE.APPENDIX V. THE SCHEME AND RAILWAY RATES.Second Report of Departmental Committee.I.1. WITH a view to arriving at a more exact estimate of the probable relief to the Railways of the proposed scheme of rating reform we have consulted the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Office, as instructed at the last meeting of the Policy Committee. Memoranda by these Departments are appended (Annexes I and II).2. As a result we find it is necessary to modify the figure of  4  adopted for the purpose of our previous report. That figure was based on present railway assessments and the existing poundage of rates. No proper revaluation of the railways has, in fact, been made since 1914, but percentage variations of the assessments for that year have been agreed year by year. We understand, however, from the Ministry of Health that discussions have for a long time been proceeding between railway companies and the Union of Assessment Committees for the substitution for this stop-gap arrangement of assessments based upon one-third of the average net annual receipts for the first five of the last six years, and that, under any such proposal, the aggregate railway assessment to be relieved of local rates would, it is estimated, be only  11m. in 1929-30, as compared with a valuation of  13im. for the same property in 1926-27. It is important to notice, however, that in the five years average taken as the basis for 1929-30, there is included the abnormal year 1926, in which the net railway receipts fell to one-half those of the previous year, and it would be a matter for discussion with the railway&apos; companies how far the results of 1926 should be taken into account. Their exclusion would increase the assessment by rather more than  1,000,000, making the estimate for 1929-30 about  12m., or  Hm. below that for 1926-273. While, however, railway assessments are tending downwards, it has been brought to our notice that the revaluation of the country which is now taking place is likely to result in a considerable increase in other assessments. This increase may perhaps be estimated at 15 per cent. If it is unaccompanied by any rise in local expenditure, the average poundage of rates will be reduced by about one-eighth. Thus, instead of the railways paying, as in 1926, an average poundage of roughly 11/Qd. on  13 m., they might in 1929-30 be paying about 10/- on  11m., or  5-5m. If it were agreed to ignore 1926 in arriving at a settlement, the figure would be increased to about  6m. A reduction of the charge to a fixed 5/- rate would mean a relief in the one case of  2.^-m., and in the other of about  3m.4. The substitution of the figure of  3 million for that of  4^ as the estimated amount by which railways would be relieved from local taxation will
involve a reduction of the approximate percentages shown in paragraph 33 of our previous Report.   That table should now be as follows : A reduction of  3 millions in the charges of:  Approximate Percentages.(a) The whole of the basic trafncs,enumerated on page 14 of thereport would be equivalent to       ... ... ...      5 (b) Ditto, excluding domestic coal ... ... ...      6l(c) Ditto, including domestic coal, but excluding beetroot,grain, potatoes, and milk   ... ... ... ...      6 (d) Ditto,   excluding  domestic  coal,  and   beetroot,   grain,potatoes and milk ... ... ... ...      7-JThe distribution of the relief would be approximately as follows: Industrial. Agriculture.  Per cent.   Per cent.(//)        ... ...      2,404.000 80 596,000 20(b) ... ...      2,308,000 77 692.000 23(c) ... ...      2.685.000 89* 315,000 10*(d) ... ...      2.626.000 87* 374,000 12-45. The reduction which these figures represent on those of the previous report appear to strengthen the case for concentrating the relief on a narrow field.6. The Minister of Agriculture at the last meeting of the Policy Committee suggested that the amount appropriated to the reduction of railway rates on agricultural traffics might be fixed according to the proportion of agricultural traffic receipts to total traffic receipts. The receipts from agricultural traffic carried by goods train, so far as they can be identified, amounted in 1927 to  14-3 millions or 12-3 per cent, of total freight train receipts. Thus, if the total amount available for reductions was  3 millions, the quota for agriculture would be  369,000.7. The agricultural quota might be fixed on a somewhat different principle. Assuming that the industries selected for reductions were confined to agriculture,, coal and heavy iron and steel, it might be argued that the proportion of the total amount of the relief available, which should go to agriculture, should be fixed according to the proportion which total receipts from agricultural traffic carried by goods train bear to the total receipts from coal and heavy iron and steel traffic so carried. This would give a percentage for agriculture of 20 per cent., representing an amount of  600.000 if  3 millions were available for distribution.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :H. P. HAMILTON. Chairman.Board of Trade. March 9. 1928.Annex I.Rating of Railways.Memorandum by the Ministry of Health.1. THE Ministry of Health has been asked by the Departmental Committee, appointed under Conclusion 6 (2) of the meeting of the Policy Committee held on the 25th January, to estimate the sum by which the local rates payable by Railway Companies -would be reduced under the contemplated scheme.2. At the outset it seems desirable to state that the Ministry would not in the normal course of its business need to make, or have the material for making, such an estimate, for it has no control over the making of valuations upon which local
rates are levied or over the amount of rates which Local Authorities levy upon the basis of those valuations.3. Scotland is outside the Ministry&apos;? sphere of action and, by arrangement, the Scottish OHice will furnish a separate estimate for that country.4. The Ministry has obtained from the Central Valuation Committee (a body constituted under the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925), information as to the rateable value of the four main railway undertakings in recent years and an estimate, which the chief of the professional valuers advising that body has made, of the probable rateable value for the year 1929-30 of all the railway property in England and Wales (excluding therefrom, docks, harbours, canals, hotels and refreshment rooms, dwelling-houses, and properties let off and capable of separate assessment).5. As regards the railway hereditaments in the occupation of the four big companies, it is understood that the estimate is based on the assumption that the rateable value for the year in question will be determined by the application of a formula which has been agreed upon as a result of negotiations between representa-tives of the Companies and of the chief Associations of Local Authorities. The effect of this formula is that 33&amp; per cent, of the average net receipts of the four Companies for the first five of the six accounting years immediately preceding shall bo taken as the rateable value for the year in question.6. As regards the property in the occupation of other railways, the sum is relatively small. The curve of known decreases of the pre-war rateable value in recent years has been followed in estimating the rateable value of these minor undertakings for 1929-30.7. The information obtained as to the Rateable value of the rateable property of the Four Companies is as follows : Year.	Running Lines.

The Valuer&apos;s estimate of the probable rateable value of the same properties is as follows : Year         ...         ... ...         ...           1929-30Running Lines       ... ...         ...         7,750,000Other Property       ... ...         ...         2,583,000Total        ...         ... ...         ...       10,333,000If from this there is subtracted in respect of clocks, harbours and canals, a sum of about  500,000, there remains  9,833,000.To this there has been added, in respect of the rateable value of the minor under-takings,  667,000, which gives a total of  10  millions roughly divided as follows:  Running lines ... ... ...      8,000,000Stations and other property     ... ...      2,500,000
9. The probable net receipts on which the estimated total of  10,333,000 is based have, it is understood, been calculated as follows: Average of actual net receipts for the four years ended the 31st December, 1926- G.W.R.       ...         ...         ...         ... ... 6,203,758.

The other factor which must be taken into consideration in making the desired estimate is the probable level of the poundage of rates which will fall to be borne by railway hereditaments.The average poundage of the rates levied in England and Wales in two recent years has been approximately as follows : .9.    d.1925-26 ... ... ... ...        12   7i1926-27 ... ... ... ...        13   21Stations and other railway property (not being running lines) are rateable in full to all local rates. Running lines are rateable in full to some rates and at 25 per cent, to the remaining rates. The resulting poundages on the rateable values of railway properties are estimated to have been approximately : On Stations and On Running Lines. other Property.s.   d. s.   d.1925-26        ... ...        10   3 12   7i1926-27        ... ...        11   0 13   2l11. It is estimated that if valuations of rateable properties as a whole remained at their present level, then, in the absence of any abnormal increase of expenditure falling to be met out of rates, the corresponding amounts for the year 1929-30 should be roughly the same as those given above for 1926-27, say, 11s. on running lines and 13s. on other property. The level of valuations will, however, certainly not be the same in 1929-30 as it is in 1927-28, for by 1929-30 the new valuations now in process of being made outside London under the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, will be in force. Those values will, it is estimated, be, on an average, about 20 per cent, above the present level. This estimate is confirmed by the known results in some half-dozen urban areas where the new valuations have been completed. On this basis, the average poundage of the rates should fall by about one-sixth, i.e., to about 11s. in respect of stations and similar property and about 9s. in respect of running lines. In that case the amount of rates payable on railway property would be :  11s. on  2,500,000 for stations, &amp;c.    ... ...      ^1,375,0009s. on  8,000,000 for running lines   ... ...       =3,600,000Total       ...... ... 4,975,00012. It may be, however, that, taking the special conditions of the rural areas and the Metropolis into account, the probable average increase of rateable value should not be put quite so high as 20 per cent. If the level of valuation is raised by (say) 15 per cent, only, poundage would fall by about one-eighth only, i.e., the rates[17446] f

It will, I think, appeal to their sense of justice and inherent fairness.2. If, however, the plan is weakened, if we are unable to say that we are releasing the producer from a rate-charge bearing no relation to his ability to pay, and if we have to leave him for an indefinite period subject to a local rate of 5/-levied on alterable local assessments, the simplicity, justice and attractiveness of our reform will be so weakened that we may not succeed in overcoming the formidable difficulties which can be foreseen.3. I am not convinced that we have yet found a way of checking local expenditure more effective than the method of grant-in-aid, always provided that the spending authority itself contributes substantially to the expenditure. I have often heard it said that a grant-in-aid leads to extravagance.

Moreover, the fears of ratepayers who are neither agriculturists nor producers, especially the fixed-income class, including more than 2 million pensioners, will be aroused; they will be told by our adversaries that they will have to make
good by increased assessments or by higher rates the exemptions given to the producers, at least in part.7. 1 have recited some only of the obvious grounds for opposition which we shall find urged against us. Each one is smaller than the great reform, but cumulatively they will arouse the sceptics of the block grants and the selfish protecting their own pockets, and all the forces of reaction, who, besides finding allies amongst our political opponents,&apos;may also find supporters amongst the doubtful and timid.8. My conclusion is that to succeed our plan must be on great and simple lines. We cannot afford to weaken the appeal that we make nor can we allow so long a time to elapse before its primary object the relief of the producer from an illogical and unfair charge is swamped in a quagmire of forseeable doubts and difficulties.9. I am of opinion, therefore, that to succeed we must be able at the outset to state that in the interest of the employed as much as in that of the producer, an end will be made of the rate-charge upon the producer, both agricultural and industrial within two or three years.If we can say in advance how we propose to raise every penny of the taxes which will be required to give the relief to the local governing bodies in substitution for the rates, so much the better, but if it is not possible, so long as we show, as we can. that we are able to finance it for three years, then we can claim that it is both unusual and unnecessary to anticipate future budgets and leave to the Chancellor of the Exchequer after the next election the duty of completing a reform which we shall have had the advantage of initiating.10. The proposed reform in the incidence of rating is comparable with the reform in taxation which in 1907 reduced the taxes on earned income while leaving the taxes on unearned income. Mr. Asquith, in fact, lost no revenue by the change; &quot;it paid for itself,&apos;&apos; as he afterwards said, but he did not indicate in advance how he would make good the loss of revenue, had there been a loss, nor need we now forestall the future; the reform may also pay for itself through increased prosperity.L.

(Revise.)CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (OP. 105 (28)).Annex I.FIRST REPORT OF POLICY PROCEDURE COMMITTEE.APPENDIX VII.Report of Sub-Committee on Scottish Rating Relief.AT their Meeting on the 12th March, 1928,* the Policy Committee invited the Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to coufer with representatives of the Treasury and the Ministry of Health on the questions respecting rating relief in Scotland raised in the concluding paragraphs of a memorandum P. (28) 10 circulated to the Committee by the Secretary of State for Scotland, and to report thereon to the Committee.2. We are agreed that in order to avoid the trouble and expense of a separate valuation of farm houses and cottages in Scotland, the principle should be adopted of accepting a fixed proportion of the gross value of the farm as representing the value of the farm houses and cottages. After examination of returns relating to Scottish agricultural districts, we think that this proportion should be one-sixth of the gross value rather than one-eighth, as suggested in P. (28) 10.3. We also agree that if agricultural land is to be completely de-rated in England and Wales, it will be necessary to give the same complete relief to the land in Scotland, and that, therefore, the alternative proposal in the penultimate paragraph of P. (28) 10, which contemplates the continuance to some extent of rates on the land, is not one which we can recommend the Committee to entertain.4. We feel that it would be quite impracticable to effect an arrangement under which a very large proportion of the total relief would pass immediately and finally to the owners of agricultural land. After considering various alternatives, we have come to the conclusion that the most equitable solution -would be one under which the benefit of the relief from owmers&apos; rates was shared equally by the owner and the tenant. This would be attained by providing for the passing on by the owner to the tenant of one-half of the benefit received by the owner during the currency of existing agricultural tenancy contracts. In the case of industrial property, the tenant should be entitled to the whole relief.5.   We accordingly submit the following recommendations to the Committee : (1.) That Agricultural premises in Scotland should be rated both for owners&apos;and occupiers&apos; rates at one-sixth of their gross value. (2.) That during the currency of existing contracts of tenancy, the owner shallpass on to the tenant half of the benefit he receives. (3.) That in the case of industrial property, the whole benefit of remission shallbe passed on to the occupier during the currency of existing contracts oftenancy.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,L.

P. (28) 14.CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (28)).Annex I.FIRST REPORT OF POLICY PROCEDURE COMMITTEE-APPENDIX VIIIThird Interim Report of Distribution Sub-Committee.1. IN our Second Interim Report (Paper P. (28) 5) we recommended that if the scheme of rating reform was to be proceeded with as planned, the responsibility for Poor Law and district roads (except streets in towns) should be transferred from Boards of Guardians and District Councils to County Councils and County Borough Councils. After consideration of our Report by the Policy Committee we were instructed to proceed with our enquiry into possible formulas for the distribution of Exchequer money proposed to be provided under the scheme on the assumption that the Committee would recommend that the transfer referred to should be made.2. The original Treasury scheme proposed that the distribution should cover compensation for loss of rates on industrial property under the scheme, the existing assigned revenue grants for services other than Education and Police, the Agricultural Rates Acts grants and the percentage grants for Health Services. We understand that it is now proposed that the grants at present paid out of the Road Fund for classified roads in London and the County Boroughs and for scheduled roads in the Counties should also be merged in the scheme.3. The total sum of Exchequer money to be provided at the outset for the purposes of the scheme will be made up of (1.) The amount of rates payable for the year 1928-9 or 1929-30 (&quot; the standard year&quot;) on the industrial and agricultural properties proposed to be derated.(2.) The existing grants proposed to be merged in the scheme payable for thestandard year. (3.) Additional Exchequer money.4. The precise sum available for distribution apart from new money cannot be determined until the figures for the standard year are available, and the amount of new money to be found from the Exchequer to launch the scheme and to provide for the growth of Local Authorities&apos; needs during the first period of 5 years, for which it is proposed that the initial grants should be fixed, cannot be determined with any approach to precision until after negotiation with the Local Authorities.5. The Treasury scheme contemplated that the whole of the money available should ultimately be divided according to a formula, based entirely on general characteristics, but owing to the very irregular distribution at the present time of the rate revenues and grants for which the new grants will be substituted, it would be impossible to introduce the formula basis at once without excessive cost. Tt was originally suggested that the bulk of the money should in the first instance be distributed on the basis of ascertained loss of rates through derating and that the distribution might be changed over to the formula basis by 10 per cent, steps at intervals of 5 years. Our investigation of such figures as are at present available, however, leads us to suggest that it may be practicable at the outset to make a
substantial adjustment possibly to the extent of 25 per cent, in the direction of distribution on the basis of a general characteristics formula and that similar adjustments should be made at each quinquennial revision, so that the deficiency grant would entirely disappear and the whole of the Exchequer money would be distributed on a formula basis within a period of say 20-25 years.6. To assist us in considering possible schemes of distribution under the proposed arrangements and illustrate the working of the scheme, we have had to assume certain figures of available money and we have thought it reasonable to take for England and Wales the sum of  57 millions made up roughly as follows :-&apos;  million.Loss of rates on industrial and agricultural property 36Existing grants          ...         ...         ...         ... 15New money   ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 657(The 36 millions is an estimate only, the 15 millions is the figure of grants for 1924-5 and the 6 millions is a purely hypothetical figure, this figure being unascertainable at the present stage of our enquiry.)As regards Scotland, we have thought that it would be premature to consider the application of a possible formula to Scotland, until a decision is reached as to the form which the reorganisation of local government proposed in connection with the present scheme is to take.7.   We have considered a scheme under which (1.) Seventy-five per cent, of the loss of rate revenue and existing grants of the standard year calculated on the basis of Poor Law and district roads being a County charge would be paid to every spending authority; and(2.) The balance of the money available would be distributed to Local Authorities under a formula based on general characteristics.The  57 millions referred to above consists as to  51 millions of existing grants and estimated rate revenues, and  6 millions of hypothetical new money. If each spending authority were granted 75 per cent, of its existing grants and rate revenues, there would be available for formula distribution  l2f millions, in addition to the  6 millions new money, making a total of  I8f millions. Roughly half of this sum would be equivalent to the remaining 25 per cent, loss of rates ( 9 11111110118) and would be given in respect of this loss in which all authorities have a claim to share. The remaining half would be given in lieu of existing grants for services which under the proposals would be almost wholly the concern of County Councils, or as new money which could be used as may be necessary for the purpose of the scheme of distribution.8. After exhaustive consideration of the problem of a formula of distribution based on general characteristics the BarstowT Committee in their Third Report (CP. 40 (27)) suggested the following : &quot;(1.) The population of the area is increased or reduced by one-third of the percentage by which the proportion of children below the age of 5 to the total population of the area is above or below the national average. Day population is taken for this purpose where it is more than 1 per cent, in excess of night population.(2.) The population so adjusted is weighted by two factors : &quot; (a.) For poverty; by one-quarter of the percentage by which the assessable value per head is below  6.&quot; (6.) For sparseness of population; by one-half of the percentage by which the adjusted population is below 300 per mile of grant-aided roads.
&quot; (3.) The figure so arrived at, multiplied by X shillings, gives the general grant for the area.&quot; Local authorities would retain the proceeds of the local taxation licence duties which are still leviable by them, as already proposed in paragraph 12 of our Second Report.&quot;We consider that this formula would be found suitable for the present purpose, subject to certain minor modifications of the factors which it is not at the moment necessary to state in detail, as they need to be finally determined in presence of the financial information now being obtained through the Ministry of Health. The standard assessable value of  6 per head given in the Barstow formula will, of course, need modification in view of the derating proposed.It was hoped that the extension of the Poor Law administrative area to the County would make it possible to introduce into the formula a major variation in the shape of a factor for unemployment, so as to give effect to the proposal that in the scheme of rating reform relief would be given to the areas most heavily burdened through unemployment. We have considered whether the Ministry of Labour figures of the total number of persons registered for employment at Exchanges within the area, expressed as a proportion of the total population of the area and averaged over a period of years, would be suitable for the purpose, and we have discussed the matter with the Ministry of Labour. There are certain difficulties in the proposal, and we are not in a position to make a recommendation in regard to it without fuller information, which is being obtained by the Ministry of Labour, and without further consultation with that Ministry. For the purpose of the calculations referred to below, we have, however, introduced a slight weighting of the formula for serious unemployment, and have slightly increased weighting for children under 5 years of age.9. For the purpose of the scheme which we have considered we have allotted to each administrative County as a whole, out of the money available for formula distribution, a grant calculated on the full formula, adjusted as stated, and to each urban authority, out of the County share, a grant arrived at on the same formula, without the loading for sparscness (which wdl be inapplicable) and for unemploy-Government (which so far as it affects pauperism will be in future a County matter), calcu-iated not at the full rate applicable to the Count)&apos;, but, as roughly half the money to be distributed by the formula, is being given in respect of loss of rates, at half the County rate. With the transfer of Poor Law and roads, other than urban streets, to the county, rates in the rural districts wrould, in most cases, be of the order of (id. to 1/- in the  , and, if a formula grant were assigned to the rural districts directly, it would have to be at a very low rate, if it were not in most cases to wipe out entirely the rate for local services. These areas would, under the scheme as a whole, benefit quite sufficiently by the transfer of their burdens to the county and by the reduction in the county rate from the formula distribution, and we have not, therefore, assigned any direct formula grant to rural districts. Special treatment would need to be accorded to those rural districts which are industrial in character and in those cases in which there is a considerable special expenses rate. These are referred to later.10. We have had calculations made of the working of the scheme of distribution which we have outlined for certain County Boroughs in respect of which particulars are available as a result of the recent circular of the Ministry of Health and also for the three counties for which particulars were furnished by the Inland Revenue for every rating area with the counties from the 1922 Valuation List.i17440jG

The effect of a distribution on this basis has also been worked out for each area in the three counties in question and is appended at the end of this paper. It will be seen that the counties include several cases of minor authorities for Education and Police. In order to secure that such authorities get the full benefit of the formula grant, this grant, so far as retained by the county council, would be credited to the general county rate which runs uniformly over the whole county. Thus, the rating authority in two towns, one of which is a minor education authority and the other not, would both receive direct the same formula grant on the same basis, and both would levy the same rate in the   for non-education county purposes which has been reduced by the grant to the county. But in the one case the rating authority would be required to raise an education rate on behalf of the county, and in the other on behalf of the local Town Council.
12. In the three counties selected, it will be seen that, notwithstanding the great alterations in the rating position due to the spreading of the cost of roads and Poor Relief, only 16 out of 103 authorities lose on balance, and of these only two are rural districts and only three areas lose more than the equivalent of a lid. rate, and in 8 of the 16 cases the loss does not exceed 3d.13. As in the case of the scheme prepared by the Barstow Committee, it is suggested that provision should be made for an over-riding guarantee that all counties and &quot;county boroughs should receive a minimum net gain of x shillings per head of population. (A minimum of 2/- would reduce the rates in Wiltshire by a further 2d. in the   all round.) In view of the great variation in the present poundage for Poor Relief and rural roads in any one county it would hardly be reasonable to guarantee every separate area in the County that it should not be one penny the worse as the result of the spreading of these charges. But a guarantee could be given, if necessary, that the calculated increase of the rate in the standard year resulting from all the changes together should not exceed, say, (id.; a figure which might perhaps be subsequently reduced in the course of negotiation to 3d. Any such guarantee must, of course, be based on the facts of one and the same year, otherwise the Exchequer would be made responsible for meeting optional variations in expenditure between one year and the next. Where the calculated increase of rate was more than this limit the grant to the authority could be increased by an amount sufficient to reduce the increase to the limiting figure. A similar provision might operate at each quinquennial revision.14. There remain for consideration the rural districts with exceptionally high general rates and those having abnormal Special Expenses rates. The rural district would, of course, receive under the normal arrangements 75 per cent, of its existing receipts from grants or rates on industrial and agricultural property; as regards the general rates, it is suggested that the guarantee that the scheme should not result in an increase of rate in excess of a certain amount would sufficiently meet the difficulty, but as regards the rates for special expenses, it would probably be necessary to provide that the whole loss in the standard year should be made good, and it is suggested that 25 per cent, of the loss should be found out of the formula grant of the county before the proposed guarantee operated. As regards future special expenses rates, power might be given to the County- Council to make a contribution to the Local Authorities at their discretion out of their formula grant. It is understood that the Onslow Commission have had under consideration a proposal that power should be given to County Councils generally to make a contribution out of general County funds towards expenses which would ordinarily be met by a rate for special expenses, where the parishes are unable owing to low rateable value to bear the necessary rate.15. We have put forward the above scheme in compliance with the desire of the Policy Committee for the earliest possible report on the matter. As already stated, it has not been possible for us to do more than take hypothetical figures of loss through derating and of new Exchequer money, in order to illustrate the working of the scheme. The scheme is purely tentative, devised to indicate and illustrate the general principles on which a system of formula distribution should be based. We have as yet very little precise information of the probable effect of derating on county areas as a whole. When further particulars are available, it will probably be necessary to modify some of the factors of the formula which we have considered. But we believe that if a reasonable amount of new money can be provided, a scheme of the kind above indicated, suitably adapted as may be required when reliable particulars of typical groups of areas are available, will be found to provide a practical basis of negotiations with local authorities.16. Until the form which the scheme will finally take is known, it would bo premature for us to suggest what assurances can or should be given to local authorities as to the basis on which the total amount of the Exchequer grant will l)e determined at each revision of the scheme. So far as we can see at present the basis of distribution of grant on revision would generally be similar to that suggested for the first quinquennium, subject, of course, to the bringing of a further proportion of the Exchequer money within the orbit of the formula grant.17.   We have also, in accordance with the direction of the Policy Committee, considered the bearing on a distribution formula, based on general characteristics, of [17446] G 2
the proposal of the Minister of Health that the 5/- rate on all existing productive properties and new productive properties should be retained by local authorities. We consider that the ecpiivalent of the 5/- rate in the standard year should then be treated as part of the deficiency due to derating and deducted from the total grant, which would otherwise be paid to the authority during the first quinquennia] period. As regards the quinquennial revision of the grant, we feel that, if allowance for low rateable value, as proposed, is to be made in the formula, the only equitable course would be to calculate the grant as if the fixed rate were, in fact, paid to the Exchequer, and then deduct from the grant to each area an amount equal to the produce of the fixed rate actually raised at the time of the revision in the area. Under such an arrangement, however, the advantages which the Minister of Health wishes to secure would be largely lost, and, if it is decided to allow local authorities to retain the 5/- rate, it will be necessary to consider further what adjustment of the rateable value factor in the formula can be made to allow of the growth in the produce of the rate being permanently retained by local authorities.We have also considered how the 5s. rate should be divided between the county council and the local district council, and have come to the conclusion that the proceeds of the rate in each area should be divided between the county and the local district in proportion to the last rates raised respectively by the county council and the district council, and that the general expenses of the county council, after deduction of the grant and the share of the 5s. rate, should then&quot; be apportioned among the rating areas of the county on basis of the rateable value of the non-productive property.18. We were instructed by the Policy Committee to consider in relation to the distribution of the new Exchequer money whether it is possible to mitigate the political difficulties involved in the transfer of poor relief and roads other than streets in towns to counties by such arrangements in regard to grants as would lie consistent with the guardians or the councils of non-county boroughs, or even of county districts, continuing in some way or to some extent to be responsible as they are at present for poor relief and/or roads in their particular areas.19. As regards Scotland, we understand that a decision has not yet been reached as to the lines on which a re-distribution of functions of local government between the various local authorities shall be made in connection with the present scheme. Till that decision is taken, it would be premature to deal with the present question as affecting Scotland. The following observations accordingly refer only to England and Wales.20. The problem referred to us is one of very great importance and difficulty. We begin by observing that the essence of the scheme under consideration by the Policy Committee is the distribution of large sums of new Exchequer money on a general characteristics formula. Such a formula, to cover services with such wide fluctuations of expenditure as poor law and roads, is only workable when applied to the larger units of local government. It is an axiom of sound government that those who are responsible for administration should also be responsible for the financial arrangements incidental to administration. Accordingly, in so far as the administration of poor relief and roads is in the hands of non-county boroughs or county district councils, the strict application of the scheme would imply that those bodies, if brought into action at all, must act solely as agents of the county councils, with money placed at their disposal for the purpose and disbursed on lines absolutely laid down for them by those councils.21. So far as roads are concerned, we would observe that under Section 11 of the Local Government Act of 1888 there is now an arrangement whereby urban authorities in a county are entitled to manage certain classes of roads with money supplied by the county, subject to conditions as to approval of estimates by the county authority. We apprehend that a similar arrangement could be made under the new scheme, provision being made for complete or partial delegation of this responsibility to urban authorities on such conditions as to provision of adequate staff and the like as the county council might think it proper to lay down. As regards roads, we do not consider that urban authorities can ask for, or should be conceded, anything more.22. When, however, we come to the question of poor relief, the position to be considered is very different. Sound administration of poor relief demands continuous day to clay examination of the circumstances of particular individuals made by
persons responsible to the ratepayer for the money which they are spending. The results of allowing poor relief authorities to administer relief out of money found in whole or in part by other authorities are shown by experience with the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund in London, and it would be regrettable indeed if the new scheme gave room for an extension of that experience. We are apprised of the Bill now before Parliament providing for control of the expenditure of London poor law authorities being vested in the Metropolitan Asylums Board, the control to be exercised through the powe;&apos; to approve estimates. That arrangement, however, is defended as a temporary&apos;expedient to mitigate a crying evil in advance of a proper scheme of poor law organisation in London, the essence of which would be to place control of administration in the hands of the body responsible for finance.23. Under the present scheme that body would be the county council. If transfer of poor law administration is to be made to some county districts or some classes of county districts, transfer must also be made of responsibility for poor law finance. Such transfer on anything like a wholesale scale would obviously be fatal to the essential principles of the present scheme. But the difficulties of limiting or restricting transfer, once the possibility of it is admitted, are serious indeed. It is an article of faith with urban districts that they should be treated in the same way as non-county boroughs, and the rural districts claim that they should have the same functions as urban districts. There would, therefore, be great difficulty in holding the position that the non-county borough or any other type of authority can receive differential treatment. It may be suggested that the criterion might be not the type of authority but the figures of population with or without figures of wealth as measured by rateable value. The practical difficulty is that wherever the limit is put in regard to such figures, indefensible cases of anomaly can be readily produced and, in the process of Parliamentary bargaining, the figure would tend to come down to a point at which the principles of the scheme might be irretrievably damaged.24. In these circumstances we should hesitate to suggest any concession on this point unless it should appear that a concession is necessary to cany out the scheme. In that event, it would be necessary to devise some arrangement under which the concession could be strictly limited by administrative process. A suggestion which occurs to us is that it might be possible to enable the council of a county district to apply to the county council for delegation, in whole or in part, of the administration of poor relief. In the event of refusal by the county council, the council of the county district might be given a right of appeal to the Minister of Health, who would be empowered to decide the claim by reference to all relevant factors, the status, resources and administrative record of the county district and the financial issues raised by the claim as affecting not merely the county district but also the county as a whole. There are precedents for such an arrangement in the existing law, though those precedents do not raise the intricate financial issues inherent in the present case. Proper consideration of those issues Would, we apprehend, tend materially to reduce the area of concession.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee : W. A. ROBINSON,(Chairman).Mi/t istry of Health.

Extract from Third Report of Departmental Committee.Ill. C OASTWIS e TrAFFI C.12. We have considered how far reductions in railway rates under the present proposals would be likely to affect the position of coastwise shipping in its competi-tion with the railways. &quot;A reduction of dock and harbour dues following the relief of docks and harbours from rates would help coastwise traffic to a slight extent, as would any reduction in the cost of bunker coal, and in due course of steel used in shipbuilding and ship-repairing arising from the application of the scheme. On the other hand, no scheme of relief from local taxation could, for obvious reasons, affect shipping directly except in a very small degree. It must, therefore, be assumed that, speaking generally, railways would gain some advantage over competitive shipping.13. The extent of this advantage must depend upon the present difference between the charges made by the railways and the shipping companies respectively for similar kinds of traffic. We gather that for bulk cargoes carried for considerable distances, such as from the Tyne to London, the rates by coasting vessels are so much lower than the railway rates that it is reasonably certain that the competitive position would not be appreciably affected by any reduction of railway rates that would result from the present proposals. On short voyages, even for heavy cargoes, the possibility of a diversion of traffic to the railways is less remote. In the carriage of general merchandise, particularly for short distances, competition between railways and coasting vessels is much closer, and for this traffic there is little doubt that any con-siderable reduction of railway rates would affect the coasting trade.14. So far as we have been able to form an opinion, it would appear that, if the reductions are confined to a few selected commodities of basic importance, it is unlikely that the. competitive position between the two kinds of transport will be seriously affected. If, on the other hand, the reductions were spread over all freights, there would obviously be a greater probability of rates clashing with one another. But this consideration is qualified by the consideration that any such reduction could only be of comparatively small amount, and it is therefore considered unlikely that serious grievances are likely to arise.15. It should be explained that under Section 39 of the Railways Act, 1921, bodies representative of the interests of shipping may make representations to the Minister of Transport that exceptional rates are being charged by the Railway Com-panies in competition with Coastwise Shipping in such a manner as to be detrimental to the public interest, and that such rates are inadequate, having regard to the cost of affording service in respect of which they are charged. If a primd facie case is made out, the Minister must refer the matter to the Tribunal, who may vary or cancel the rates. It may be mentioned that coastwise shipping interests have so far never sought to put this machinery into operation.16. The. existence of this machinery would provide an answer to any complaints from coastwise shipping that might arise under the Scheme, and it would obviously be convenient to retain it. On the other hand, it might be considered necessary to deprive shipping interests of this right of appeal to the Rates Tribunal if it were[ 17446] h
thought that as a result the working of the scheme of reductions would be seriously prejudiced. We. do not think that this danger is likely to arise; as already indicated, the grievances will probably be neither many nor serious.17. Our conclusion is that at the present stage it is unnecessary to assume that it will be necessary to cancel the power of appeal given to the coastwise shipping com-panies. If this is accepted, it is unnecessary to attempt to frame any special scheme for meeting complaints. On the other hand, we consider that the. Departments concerned should continue to watch this aspect of the Scheme as it develops.Signed on behalf of the Committee:H. P. HAMILTON(Chairman).Board of Trade, March IS, 1928.
CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (28)).Annex I.FIRST REPORT OF POLICY PROCEDURE COMMITTEE.APPENDIX X.Fourth Interim Report of the Distribution Sub-Committee.AT the Fifth Meeting of the Policy Committee the Distribution Committee were requested to examine the desirability of prescribing a new definition of rateable value in the. case of new undertakings and extensions of existing undertakings.In the case of England and Wales, the existing definition of rateable value con-tained in section 22 of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, is &quot; the rent at which the hereditament might reasonably be expected to let from year to year if the tenant undertook to pay all usual tenants rates and taxes . . . .&quot;If both existing undertakings and new or extended undertakings are to become subject to the same sort of charge (whether a national levy or a local rate of fixed poundage levied on a rateable value which is not to be fixed but may vary from time to time), it would appear that the question of modifying the definition of rateable value arises in both cases.It follows from the definition that, other things being equal, if the &quot;usual tenant&apos;s rates &quot; are reduced the. rateable value will be increased; and if the rates are increased the rateable value will be diminished. So that if the ordinary poundage of the rates in a district is 15s., the reduction of the poundage on productive pro-perties to a flat 5s. will theoretically be followed by an increase of the rateable value of such properties, and this increase of rateable value will result in the taking away of some part of the benefit of the relief which it is contemplated should be given to the manufacturer.These considerations suggest some modification of the definition to indicate that for the purpose of calculating the rateable value of productive properties the usual tenant&apos;s rates shall be deemed to be such rates as are payable on non-productive properties in the area.It may be claimed, however, that this modification of the definition does not go far enough; that in theory a permanent reduction in the rates payable on a property will be followed by some increase in the rent at which the. property will let from year to year, and that this in turn will react on the rateable value. It will be suggested that ultimately the advantage, of the derating proposals to the manufacturer will be less then he expects and that some or all of the benefits will go to the landlord.On the other hand, other factors telling in the opposite direction need to be taken into consideration. For example, the advantage given to industry by the rate con-cession will tend to increase the. supply of manufacturing premises, and thus to lower rents and rateable value.These are very debateable questions of the incidence of rates, which cannot be set aside by any tinkering with the definition of rateable value, and it seems undesirable to bring them into prominence by proposing a modification of the definition in one particular.[17446] H 2MOST SECRET. P. (28) 16.
It may be mentioned that where in the past certain classes of property have, by statute, been relieved of a proportion of their rates, no special provision as to the definition of rateable value of such properties has been made.On the whole, therefore, we recommend that no modification to the definition should be proposed on this occasion.In the case of Scotland, the difficulty so far as resting on the reference to &quot; usual tenant&apos;s rates and taxes &quot; in the definition of &quot; rateable value &quot; does not arise. The effects of derating on rents, and therefore on assessable values, will probably be the same in Scotland as in England, and the considerations which lead us to recommend no action as regards England apply also as regards Scotland.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee : W.

P. (28) 17.CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (28)).Annex I.FIRST REPORT OF POLICY PROCEDURE COMMITTEE.APPENDIX XL. PUBLIC UTILITY UNDERTAKINGS.Fourth Repovt cf Departmental Committee.1. Terms of Reference. By Conclusion 4 (2) of the Third Meeting of the Policy Committee held on the 27th Fein nary we were instructed as a Departmental Committee to consider and report on what, if any. classes of public utility under-takings in addition to railways should be given relief from rates, and what part, if any. of such relief the undertakings should be required to pass on to their customers and to what classes of customers.2. General Considerations. The object of the Plan is to grant relief from local taxation to manual and mechanical processes of production. On this basis, public utility undertakings which are engaged primarily in productive enterprise, e.g., gas and electricity, would fall within the scope of the scheme. But it is assumed that in the case of these sheltered quasi-monopolies. it is desirable to enquire how far any relief, if granted, would be likely to pass to users under existing arrange-ments or whether ad hoc arrangements are desirable. It is suggested that in the case of productive concerns it will be sufficient if the relief passes to users generally and not only to industrial users.3. So far as public utility undertakings are not engaged primarily in produc-tion it would appear that they had no primd facie title to relief. On the other hand, so far as they carry out services ancillary to production, it would be in accordance with the general objects of the Plan if they obtained relief fr-om rates and such relief accrued to the benefit of industrial users.4. The Two Groups. Thus for purposes of the present discussion, public utility undertaking fall into two groups : Group A :  Productive Undertakings  Gas.Electricity.Water (this is arguable).Group B : Other Undertakings  Railways. Tramways. Canals. &apos;Harbours and Docks.Group A.Gas and Electricity.5. Gas and electricity undertakings must, it is assumed, receive similar treatment. They are regarded as in competition with one another, although the degree of competition varies from use to use and from locality to locality. Moreover, the Statutory controls to which they are subject are similar in character, and it
would be difficult, for example, to tighten a particular kind of control in the case of electricity without applying similar measures to a gas undertaking which was subject to a similar scheme.6. An AjspendLv to this report contains notes by the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Transport on gas and electricity respectively. These show that in neither ease under existing arrangements would all the relief from local taxation pass to the users. The Board of Trade and Ministry of Transport are now proceeding to investigate the interactions of gas and electricity in the present connection and we should propose to make a further report when these enquiries are complete.&apos; Meantime, the notes in the Appendix will serve to show the general position in regard to these undertakings.Water.7. It may be argued that water undertakings come within the producer group. Exact information is not at present available, but it is thought that they pay in local taxation from  2i to  3 millions a year. We suggest that, having regard to the large amount involved, the claim to relief of water undertakings should be closely scrutinised.8. It is estimated that domestic use accounts for about two-thirds to three-quarters of the national consumption of water, and industrial use for the remaining one-third or one-fourth. As regards the domestic user, it may be noted that, generally speaking, he pays for water according to the rateable value of his premises and not by reference to the actual amount consumed. It appears, therefore, that as regards the domestic user, the water supply is regarded more in the nature of a public service, such as drainage or the cleaning and lighting of streets, than as a commercial service, for which he pays according to use. The industrial user, on the other hand, pays according to his consumption, and in this regard is in the same position as the user of gas or electricity. Thus it might be argued that, as water is essential to production, it would be in accordance with the object of the Plan if such users were enabled to obtain their water supply more cheaply. Against this has to lie put the consideration that the position of the national water supply is. we understand, causing a certain anxiety, as there is a possibility of future scarcity. In these circumstances it may be contended that it would not be in the national interest to take steps which would result in a cheapening of supply.9. If water undertakings are regarded as productive enterprises, their exclusion from the scheme of disrating might be found difficult to defend in principle. But the arguments adduced above may render it possible to contend that there is no suflieient national advantage to be derived from their inclusion which would offset adequately the additional burden which would be imposed upon the finances of the Plan if they came within its scope.Group B. Railways.10. The Government have already taken certain action in regard to railways, the nature of which must be taken into account in considering whether other public utility undertakings not engaged primarily in production shall be granted relief. The principal railway companies have been informed that the Government are inclined to the opinion that railways should be brought within the scheme, provided that the relief afforded should be wholly transmitted to industrial and agricultural users by reductions in traffic charges. This condition has been further refined by requiring the reductions to be restricted to certain basic traffics. It appears to follow from the proposed restriction of reductions to industrial and agricultural traffics that purely passenger lines and probably lines carrying very little freight traffic should not be disrated.11. This particular kind of scheme is made practicable by the facts : (a) that the four amalgamated companies, which between them pay 95 per cent, of the local taxation borne by railways, carry the great bulk of the selected traffics; and (&amp;) that these companies are subject to a special form of control which can be adapted for r-resent purposes.  It is not to be expected that the opportunity for concentrating the-
relief in certain specified directions will be found in the same measure in other public utility concerns: and we assume that in considering them we are not rccpiired to go further than to explore how far any relief that may be granted from local taxation will enure to the benefit of industry generally. It may be added that not only does the form of control to which the amalgamated lines are subject facilitate the proposed arrangements but it actually renders them necessary. Without them, the relief for the time being would pass to the shareholders.Tramways,12. Tramways exist for the conveyance of passengers, and it would therefore appear, on the analogy of what has been proposed in the case of the passenger railways, that tramway undertakings should not be granted relief from local taxation. At the same time, tramway concerns have for many years past been extremely dissatisfied with their position in regard to local taxation, and it may be expected that on this account they will press for inclusion within the scheme. But the question whether they are equitably assessed is not relevant to their inclusion or non-inclusion within the scheme, and it is submitted that their grievances must be left to be dealt with in some other and more appropriate way.Canals.13. Canals are in direct competition with railways. It would appear therefore (hat they should obtain relief from local taxation if it can be shown that the relief will benefit industry.14. The amount of rates levied on canal undertakings is generally small. Exact figures are not available, as various taxes, tithes and insurance are included with rates in the accounts of the undertakings, but the inclusive total of this item is under  200.000.15.   The principal traffics carried by canal in 1927 were as follows : Commodity. Tons.Coal and Coke           ...         ... ... 7,066,400Manures       ...          ...          ... ... 929,035Building materials other than wood ... 1,264,453Wood           ...         ...         ... 336,933Raw materials           ...         ... ... 1,594,549Agricultural produce and food-stuns ... 1,455,2S6Industrial products and machinery ... 1,529,996Liquids in bulk         ...          ... ... 731,701Unclassified                ...          ... ... 264,518Total ... ... ..      15,172,87116. It will be seen that coal constitutes nearly 50 per cent, of the total tonnage and that manures and agricultural produce account for a substantial proportion of the remaining traffic. Provided that the relief reaches the users, the industries which would benefit are for the most part those which have been selected for special treatment in connection with the railways.17. It should be explained that canal undertakings do not usually themselves act as carriers, but derive their revenue from tolls levied upon the carriers in respect of goods passing through the navigation. Thus, if the canal authorities were required to reduce the tolls which are paid by canal carriers, it would not automatically follow that the carriers, who collect the conveyance charges from traders, and are not subject to control in any way, would reduce their charges correspondingly. To control in any way the&apos; charges of the carriers, who are frequently small men owning and working a single barge, would not be practicable, but the force of competition with the railways must operate in the direction of the reduction of carriers&apos; charges.18. The existing machinery for controlling canal charges is as follows : With certain important exceptions, the principal canal authorities obtain their present charging powers from Directions given by the Minister of Transport and continued
in force by the Canals (Continuance of Charging Powers) Act, 1924, which is in turn continued from year to year by the Expiring Laws Acts. If the Minister is moved to do so by interested parties, he may, after reference to an Advisory Committee, modify these powers of charging if it appears to him that, owing to changes in the cost of labour and materials, or other circumstances affecting the canal or inland navigation, they are excessive. Any marked fall in the expenditure of a canal authority would be likely to lead to an application to the Minister for a revision of charges, especially if, as in the circumstances now in question, the saying to the undertaking^ expenditure was a matter of common knowledge.19. It is necessary, however, as has been explained, for the Minister to refer the matter to a Statutory Advisory Committee for advice, and they would be bound to have regard to the general financial position of the undertaking rather than to the motive underlying1 any special scheme of Government policy. The Minister, acting quasi-judicially, might, therefore, not be able in all cases to order a corresponding reduction in the charges in respect of the relief to the undertaking^20.   We are led to the conclusions la.) That by force of the competition with the railways, the bulk of the relief from local taxation would pass to the traders who use the canals. (b.) That in view of the present nature of the traffics on the canals, a substantial proportion of any relief so passed on would benefit coal and agriculture,and that no scheme of selected traffics is necessary. (p.) There can be no guarantee under existing arrangements that the whole ofthe relief would pass to the canal users. (d.) That any such requirement would need an extension of the statutory controlof canal undertakings, which could not extend to the carriers.21. Having regard to the comparatively small amount of money involved, the nature of the traffics carried and the competition with the railways, we suggest that canal undertakings might obtain relief under the scheme, and that there should be no extension of existing statutory control.22. The harbours and docks of the country are an essential link in the chain of transporting commodities, and a reduction in their expenditure should help industry if it is passed on to users.23. The total amount paid in respect of rates, so far as they can be identified, by representative harbour and dock undertakings of the country is about  1,300,000. The total amount involved would therefore be rather more than this sum. The figures doubtless include rates in respect of warehouses on dock premises, but it is understood that the Ministry of Health cannot say how far the rates of the Port of London Authority, where the burden of rates and taxes amounts to over  400,000 a year, or of other large Dock undertakings, are incurred in respect of warehouses or other properties which would fall outside the scheme.24. The economic circumstances of the docks vary widely. At one end of the scale there are the small harbours which are mainly, or even entirely, fishing harbours, and at the other end of the scale are the great coal ports, such as Barry and Cardiff, the mercantile ports, such as Hull, London, Southampton, Bristol and the Mersey, where general commodities of every sort are freely imported and exported. The proportion of import and export traffic at different ports will also vary widely, and many features of specialisation will be found. Many ports depend mainly upon the export of coal, while others export none. If it were decided to bring docks within the scheme, it does not appear to us advisable or practicable, in view of the very varying nature of the business of the principal ports, to attempt to impose a flat scheme of reductions in favour of a few selected traffics. Any relief from local taxation would be left to flow to the traffics which, in the commercial discretion of the Port Authorities, are considered to he most entitled to it, and to be applied in that discretion towards reducing dues and charges on ships or on goods, and in the latter ease in respect of wharfage or of labour charges, as may be most expedient.25. The position in regard to the control of dock charges is somewhat similar to that existing in the case of the canals.   There are certain dock authorities ofHarbours and Docks.
importance, eg., Leith, Grecnock, Manchester and the Mersey Harbour Board, where no power is vested in the Minister to enforce a reduction of charges. About fifteen small harbours, many of which are merely fishing harbours, derive their present powers in a few cases from Orders made under the Temporary Increase of Charges Acts, which are continued from year to year. These Acts provide for a power of revision by the Minister. The four amalgamated railway companies, which own a large proportion of the docks of the country, arc working under private Acts which contain.a revision clause. These Acts expire in 1929. Other dock and harbour undertakings have obtained special powers since the War to increase their charges by varying percentages, and, where such powers have been accorded, the Ministry has usually, but not invariably, been given power to revise such charges on the application of traders.26. If it were desired to ensure that the whole of any relief from rates should be passed on by every undertaking to its users, special legislative provisions would, as in the case of canals, be required. In exercising his powers of revision under the existing Acts, the Minister would again have to be governed by consideration of the existing and prospective financial position of the undertakings. He could not have regard solely to the objects of the present scheme, and, indeed, in the case of some of the weaker undertakings, he might be forced to the conclusion that the relief from rates should be left to redound wholly to the advantage of the undertakings concerned.27. Thus, as in the case of canals, there can be no guarantee that if docks and harbours were brought within the scheme the whole of the relief would go to users, and in this connection it must be borne in mind that some important dock under-takings are free of all control. To lay down that all relief must so pass would require a strengthening of existing controls and the imposition of control upon important authorities which have hitherto been free from State interference.28. Through the exercise of the powers of the Minister of Transport, clock dues will in some cases reflect any relief that may be granted. In other cases the fact that the docks are in competition with one another will tend to cause the bulk of the relief to be passed on. It must also be remembered that the dock and harbour authorities, which ordinarily do not work for profit, are largely constituted by shipowners, merchants and other users. This is in itself some safeguard that without any special measure of control reductions in expenditure would lead to reductions in dues and charges. Our ultimate conclusion is that docks and harbours might be brought within the scheme, if the fact that the passing on of the whole of the relief cannot be guaranteed is not an insuperable obstacle.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :(Signed) H. P. HAMILTON,(Chairman).Board of Trade,March 20, 1928.Appendix.Gas Undertakings.Note by the Board of Trade.1. THE bulk of the public gas supply comes from Municipalities and Companies which are under some form of statutory control. There are also numerous non-statutory gas Companies which are under no control at all, but they account for a very small part of the whole supply, probably about 5 per cent. The rates paid by statutory undertakings are approximately  2 million a year.2. A proportion varying from \ to \ of the revenue of gas undertakings is obtained from sales of bye-products such as coke, tar and ammonia, and for this part of their business the undertakings are in competition with the coke oven and chemical industries. It may be expected, if the coke oven and chemical industries obtain some relief from rates, that the market price of coke and ammonia will fall and the revenue of gas undertakings will be correspondingly reduced.   The system[17446] i &apos;
of price and dividend control does not afford automatic compensation to the gas undertaking for such a fall in revenue from bye-products; and the gas undertaking would no doubt put forward this fact as an argument for relief.3. Municipal gas undertakings are responsible for about 36 per cent, of the total public supply of gas and can charge for gas up to a maximum price. In general their prices are far below the maximum, being fixed in competition with coal. oil. and electricity and any rate reliefs might be expected to go to a further reduction of gas prices.4.   Non-municipal gas undertakings Fall into three classes: -Maximum Price Companies. These Companies are responsible for about 9 per cent, of the public gas supply. They are authorised to pay up to but not more than a pre-dctermined dividend, and permitted to charge up to but not more than a. pre-determined price for gas. Most of the Companies are paying their maximum dividends and not charging their maximum price. As with municipal gas undertakings under the same form of control, any rate relief might be expected to go to a further reduction of gas prices.Sliding Scale Companies. These Companies are responsible for about 43 per cent, of the public gas supply. They can raise their dividends above a standard dividend when their price to the ordinary consumer is below a standard price and their dividends must be reduced below the standard dividend when the price is above the standard price. If their standard price and dividend have been recently revised, the benefit of a decrease in costs, due to relief from rates, would go to the extent of about four-fifths to the consumer and one-fifth to the shareholders. Most of the important Companies are in this position. If the standard price has not been recently revised there is no certainty that the relief will go to the consumer, but the Local Authority can, and should, in such cases apply for a revision of the standard price, and if the Company is given the benefit of the relief there will at once be an inducement to the Local Authority to take action.Basic Price Companies. There are only seven Companies under this form of control, but they are responsible for about 10 per cent, of the public gas supply. They can raise their dividend above a basic dividend by an amount dependent on the average selling price of gas. As a reduction in the average price of gas. and not, as for sliding scale Companies, a reduction in the price to the domestic consumer entitles the Company to pay a higher dividend, this system of control is not working well as a protection to the ordinary consumer, the system favours the giving of specially favourable rates to large industrial users. There is, however, the same anticipation as with other forms of control, that the bulk of any rate relief would go to consumers of one class or another. The principle of the basic price system of control as a protection to the domestic consumer will probably be considered by a Select Committee this Session.Electrical Undertakings.Note by the Ministry of Transport.1. The information available in the published returns upon the various under-takings shows the amount paid by each undertaking in respect of rents, rates and taxes in one figure in 1925-26, the latest year for which particulars are available. Rents, rates and taxes amounted to about  3,140,000, which is 12-82 per cent, of the total working expenses, excluding capital charges, or, approximately, 7-3 per cent, of the total revenue from working. It may roughly be taken that two-thirds of the total represents local rates, i.e., about  2 millions. In 1924-25, out of a total payment under the head of Rent, Rates and Taxes of  2,725,000, Local Authorities and Companies together paid in respect of local rates  1,788,000, of which sum  1,187,000 was contributed by Local Authorities and  601,000 by Companies. It is not possible to say what proportion of the assessments was in respect of offices and showrooms or other properties which will be excluded from the scheme, but the amount is not likely to be substantial.2. If special steps are to be taken to ensure that the relief is passed on to consumers by all the electrical undertakings, it appears that some strengthening of the present statutory powers of control will be necessary.   The prices charged by
authorised distributing undertakings, both municipal and Company, are subject to maximum prices laid down in the Special Orders made under the Electricity (Supply) Acts, and are subject to revision by the Minister of Transport at triennial periods only. The Minister has no power of initiative in the matter of price revision, but can only act on the application of interested parties, e.g.t local authorities or bodies of consumers. As charges can only be revised at intervals of three years and as the control permits of fixing merely maximum and not actual prices, the existing machinery would not ensure reductions-of price under the present scheme.3. It should be mentioned that the London Companies are subject to a different form of price control, viz., a sliding scale of price and dividend (much on the lines of that applicable to the South Metropolitan Gas Company); and the scale is subject to revision from time to time in certain circumstances. Local Authorities, who own about two-thirds of the distributing undertakings, are not under any scheme of sliding scales, but are subject, as stated above, to maximum prices.The Power Companies are for the most part subject to sliding scales, in addition to maximum prices, but in no case has the scale yet come into practical operation, mainly owing to the large sums payable by way of back dividends.March, 192s..1[17446]
P. (28) 20.CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (28)).Annex II.Second Report of Policy Procedure Committee.1. WE have been instructed to analyse the available figures for the purpose of comparing the effect upon the rate revenue of local authorities of the two alternative plans: (A.) The plan under which public utility undertakings, including railways, areincluded in the scope of derating, and all derated properties (other thanagricultural) remain subject to a fixed rate of 5/-. (B.) The alternative plan under which railways and public utility undertakingsare excluded from the scheme of derating and the fixed 5/- rate on other industrial property is swept away.For convenience, we refer in what follows to these two plans as Plan (A) and Plan (B) respectively.2. It appears from the figures annexed (Appendix I) that, taking all those areas in which the rate revenue accruing in respect of the properties within the scope of the original scheme exceeds 40 per cent, of the total that is to say, those cases in which the effect of derating on local government arrangements is likely to be most disturbing Plan (B) is less favourable than Plan (A) in one case only, namely, that of the rural district of Orsett in Essex, where the percentage of rate revenue with-drawn from the Authority would be under Plan (A) 42-8 per cent, and under Plan (B) 54-8 per cent. The broad effect of the substitution of Plan (B) for Plan (A) is to benefit (in the sense of leaving more rate revenue in the hands of local authorities) the predominantly agricultural areas and certain urban areas of the type of East Ham, Gateshead, West Ham, West Hartlepool, Barking and Romford, in which either docks or gas works or other public utilities form a substantial part of the rateable property in the area. Plan (A), on the other hand, operates to the advantage of such industrial areas as Bolton, Burnley, Huddersfielcl. Oldham, Rochdale, Stock port and Warrington, but it is to be noted that these areas do not present any instance of extreme variation, the loss of rate revenue under either Plan being under 30 per cent.3. The figures from which these inferences are drawn relate in the main to the areas which were selected for the purposes of the work of the Distribution Committee with the addition of certain county boroughs and cases taken from the counties of Essex and Radnor. There is no primd facie reason for not regarding these samples as fairly representative of the country as a whole, but until a much closer investigation has been undertaken it is not possible to give any assurance as to the number of extreme cases arising from an exceptional combination of local circumstances which may be thrown up. As instances of such extreme variation, we might refer to two cases which have come to light in the course of an independent investigation, that of the urban district of Greasbrough in Yorkshire, where under Plan (B) the percentage of property excluded from rating would be 08-8 per cent., and under Plan (A) only 55 per cent., and that of the urban district of Tilbury, where the figures are 3-1 per cent, and 40-5 per cent, respectively.
4. A reservation must also be made with regard to certain types of areas in the north, which are probably not fairly represented oy the figures in Appendix I, and in which it must be expected that Plan (A) will prove substantially more favourable to the Local Authority than Plan (B). Figures are annexed (Appendix II) showing the results in some typical areas of this character.5. The representative of the Scottish Office informs us that the detailed figures for Scottish areas have been called for, but that he does not anticipate that the conclusions indicated above with regard to England will not be found generally applicable to Scotland. )Signed on behalf of the Departmental Committee, JOHN ANDERSON, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.

P. (28) 21.CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (CP. 105 (28)).Annex III.IS IT EQUITABLE AND WISE THAT INDUSTRY SHOULD MAKE NO CONTRIBUTION TO LOCAL RATES ?THE proposal to exempt industry totally from rates is and can only be justified by acceptance of the view that it is economically unsound to tax instruments of production.  The profits resulting from the use of such instruments are already taxed under the steeply ascending scales now in force.    The imposition of rates upon productive plants is double taxation.   It is an invidious impost which falls with increasing weight as the instruments become more bulky and afford employment to larger numbers of manual workers.   This discourages the employment of manual workers and is a contributory factor to the disastrous unemployment which has now become chronic.   The task set to a British employer of labour on a large scale is exceptionally difficult.   Compared to the profits yielded to bankers and merchants or producers who do not require to use large plants or employ many workpeople, the rewards of industry have seriously and rapidly diminished.   The temptation to seek easier means of wealth getting than those involved in providing employment for labour is increasing and ought to be diminished.   An employer paying wages to a large number of workpeople must at the present time in this country be regarded as rendering a service to the community rather than obtaining a privilege at their hands.   In strict equity individuals should be taxed according to what they have to spend and enjoy and not according to the class of gainful occupation they pursue. Tf the balance is to be loaded at all, it should certainly not be against those who are discharging a primary and vital function to the community and who are flagging under the load they bear.     The services rendered by the community to a large employer in protecting his works and providing for his workpeople are exactly repaid by the effort which he makes to supply the wages of large numbers of citizens, and no further special payment can be required by the community on account of the extensive nature of his premises.   There is no reason of justice and still less of policy for discriminating in favour of the man who makes -610,000 a year from a small office with half a dozen clerks and the man who makes  10,000 a year by employing 100 men: and the idea of exacting from the latter a heavy and special contribution for the protection of his works in a year when he has derived no benefit from it although he has provided much employment is irrational in theory and injurious in practice.   Let all get their living how they can on even terms and let the State tax their profits according to the magnitude.The above deals with the relations in our present social system between the employer of labour and the community or the national State. The requirements of the Local Authorities in whose districts particular factories are situated are a most important but altogether separate question. Under the present scheme, the State relieves the producer from the invidious burden, and from its own resources reimburses the Local Authority for the diminution in its rateable assets. That reimbursement is at present to be effected partly by direct compensation for the loss, partly by a variable provision based upon needs, and partly by an extra grant from the State to prevent hardship to any Local Authority. If it be desired, in addition, to make Local Authorities partners to some extent in additions to national prosperity, this aspect can be studied. Tt is not intended that, the Local Authorities should be cut off from all share in the expansion of wealth. Any reasonable scheme for associating them with the rise in the national fortunes is
entirely in haimony with the main conceptions of the present policy, provided practical difficulties can be overcome. Any such extension as has hitherto taken place is, however, reflected far more in the residential property, which is still left to the Local Authorities, than in the producing plants which it is now proposed to remove from their control.W.

P. (28) 22.CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE (OP. 105 (28)).Annex IV.THE COMPLETE DERATING OF INDUSTRY.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I HAVE been asked to summarise the arguments which I presented to the Committee yesterday in support of the complete derating of industry. They are briefly as follows:-1. Complete relief enormously strengthens the general fighting case. The ultimate goal becomes the immediate goal.2. The actual benefit to industry is much greater if the whole of the relief is given in a form which directly reduces the standing costs which the industry has to bear, rather than by giving&quot; the relief partly in direct reduction of rate charges and partly in a remission of railway rates.(a.) Even in the case of the industries selected for a special remission of railway rates this is so. Take first the case of steel. It is estimated that every shilling relief of local rates is equivalent to 3d. per ton on finished steel. A 6 per cent, reduction in railway rates would probably mean, on the average, about Sd. per ton; 5/- off local rates would be 1/3 per ton. Moreover, every steel maker would know that he was going to obtain a direct relief on his costs of 1/3. The railway relief would only benefit him to the extent to which he obtained his rawr materials cheaper. Again, direct relief of rates operates more equitably for the benefit of every firm. The amount of railway relief varies in the length of haul of the raw materials received at the works. I have consulted Sir William Larke, and he is strongly of opinion that the direct relief of rates is both fairer and more beneficial to the steel industry.In coal the same arguments apply, though to a less degree. A total abolition of local rates would give to that industry on an average a benefit of to od. a ton. Six per cent, reduction in railway rates would mean, on an average, a reduction of 2d. a ton on all coal, or 2\d. a ton if domestic coal could be excluded. It might, therefore, be argued that coal would benefit at least as much by a partial reduction of local rates and a 6 per cent, reduction on railway rate charges. This, however, assumes that the coalowner will get the whole benefit of the railway relief. In export coal this is probably true; in other coal it is very doubtful whether the relief will go to the coalowner. Indeed, the argument that  a induction of railway rates on raw material will benefit the steel industry negatives any argument that coal will benefit. The argument in the ease of steel is that, by reducing railway rates the steel maker will obtain his raw material cheaper. The largest element in this raw material is coal. If the steel maker obtains the benefit the coalowner does not. The Mines Department are strongly of opinion that the coal industry will benefit more by a complete remission of rates, and they are convinced that this view would be endorsed by the mining industry itself.(b.) All industries other than those selected for special railway treatment will, of course, benefit to the extent of a third more by the complete remission of rates. Moreover, by giving complete remission, we shall avoid all charges of discriminating between one industry and another.3. Our time table becomes much simpler. We avoid a rather complicated railway bill, in the course of which we should have to resist the claims of all non-setected industries.
Board of Trade. March 27, 1928.4. We avoid the conflict of interest between the four main line Companies and the Metropolitan Railway, and the tube railways and the trams.5. We are able, without argument, to leave gas and electricity out of our plan, and we avoid the risk of being involved in very tiresome legislation, which would be necessary if we were to bring gas and electricity into this scheme, and were then compelled, as we should be, to insure that the benefit of the rate relief was passed on to the consumer.6. A small but simple adjustment will be necessary in the case of gas, in order to give gas undertakings a rate relief on the proportion of their revenue derived from the sale of coke and by-products. In this they must be treated in the same way as manufacturing plants producing the same commodities in competition with them.7. The railways ought to be equally willing to support the scheme, because any aggregate of relief which improves manufacturing capacity, particularly in the heavy industries, should lead to an increase of traffic on their lines. The Railway Companies will also receive some satisfaction from other elements in the plan.8. The complete relief of industry and the exclusion of all public utilities makes no difference to the general finance of the scheme. The extra relief to industry amounts to  74; millions, and the exclusion of public utilities relieves the Exchequer of a charge of  7\ millions.P. C.-L.
