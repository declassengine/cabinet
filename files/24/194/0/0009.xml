P. A. HANKEY.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. March 30, 1928.******(9.)-ADEN-PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMAM.(Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 231st Meeting, Minute 14.)SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that he had raised this question as a matter of urgency, because the Resident at Aden had telegraphed, saying that the Imam now appeared to be sincerely desirous of a settlement, and suggesting that he should be authorised to start negotiations immediately, before the Imam&apos;s mood changed. In the Residents view, the best way to deal with the situation was to have a short preliminary treaty, on the simplest lines, followed by a more complete one, which could be settled at leisure. Sir Samuel Hoare said that he entirely endorsed this proposal.Mr. AMERY agreed. Air action had proved extraordinarily effective. The Imam had returned his captives; he was apprehensive of rebellions amongst his subjects; and he was now, for the first time, ready to give way on the frontier question. We ought to take advantage of the psychological moment, and make a preliminary treaty on the basis of the mutual recognition by each side of the independence of the other, and the ImanPs evacuation of our Protectorate.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN agreed that we ought to strike while the iron is hot. If a preliminary treaty could be arranged on the lines suggested, so much the better. But he would like to go further and suggest that it should be impressed on General Stewart that the chance of effecting a settlement should not be jeopardised by too rigid insistence on formal points.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD referred to the following extract from the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B, para-graph 21 (5)):-&quot; We desire to record our opinion that, from the military point of view, it is necessary to occupy only such portions of the Aden Protectorate as are essential to the security of the naval base, and that any additional commitments are liable to be a source of military embarrassments.&quot; [17452]
He said that he still subscribed to that opinion; and his recommendations for the garrison of Aden had been based on the assumption that there would not be undue extension of our Protectorate to the eastward. He suggested that instructions to that effect should be sent to General Stewart.Mr. AMERY thought that we certainly ought not to stand out for the evacua-tion by the Imam of undefined territory to the Eastward, over which we possibly had. a shadowy claim. But, for the moral position of His Majesty&apos;s Government, we ought to insist on his evacuation of the essential portions of our Protectorate. Subject to that proviso, he thought that General Stewart should be given a free hand.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN considered that the instructions to General Stewart should be more precise. In Aden as in other parts of the world it had been the tradition to put the amount of hinterland required for defence too high. The Chiefs of Staff had now recorded the opinion that, from the military point of view, our territorial responsibilities in the Aden Protectorate should be reduced, and our obligations to the tribes constituted the only obstacle to doing so. In default of definite instructions, General Stewart might be actuated by the Aden tradition and put our territorial requirements too high.Mr. AMERY stipulated that General Stewart should not be required to take any action which might seriously impair his authority or that of his successor.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD said that the Air Force Officer, who was to assume command of Aden with effect from the 1st April, was well aware of the views of the Chiefs of Staff. He suggested that General Stewart should be instructed to consult him on this question.Conclusion&apos;.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to recommend : That, in view of the urgency of the case, the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to despatch the following telegram to General Stewart forthwith : &quot; Your proposal for immediate negotiations of preliminary treaty with Imam on lines advocated by you is approved. If, however, there is difficulty about the precise extent of the evacuation of Aden territory which the Imam must carry out to enable us to agree to preliminary treaty, you will keep in mind views of Chiefs of Staff as to military tindesirability of undue extension of our territorial responsibility, and will therefore only insist on immediate evacuation of such minimum area as (a) you, yourself, regard as essential from the point of view of our obligations to the tribes: and (b) you, in consultation with the Air Officer Commanding, consider of importance from the point of view of defence. The final adjustment of the boundary outside this minimum area can then be left to the subsequent detailed treaty.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER, in authorising the despatch of the above telegram in view of the urgency of the situation, asked that the Cabinet should be informed at the first opportunity.*******
