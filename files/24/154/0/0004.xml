FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT-LEAGUE  OF NATIONS.Date of First Meeting of the Council. On 9th November Sir Eyre Crowe reported [No. 1541] that it had been agreed that the first meeting of the Council of the League of Nations should be held in Paris, and that it should deal solely with the appointment of the Saar Delimitation Commission, unless the United States should have ratified the treaty, in which case other urgent matters might also be taken. Lord Curzon&apos;s consent to Paris as the meeting place had been given on the express understanding that only the Saar Delimitation Commission should&apos; be on the agenda,ARABIA.Ibn Sand. On 5th November Sir Milne Cheetham repeated to the Foreign Office [No. 1542] a telegram which he had sent to the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad informing him that according to a report from the British Agent at Jedclah taxes were being collected by a governor placed at Turaba1 by Ibn Saud ; and further that the road from Yemen was being closed, by him. In view of the tactical position of Turaba, the withdrawal of this individual was regarded by the British agent as essential to the public security.&quot; Sir Milne Cheetham added that King Hussein was willing to treat Turaba as neutral until the Boundary Commission had given its decision, and it would be a great help if the Civil Commissioner could obtain from Ibn Saud a similar undertaking coupled with the withdrawal of his governor.ARMENIA.Conventions with Georgia. On 4th November [No. 116, received Sth November], Mr. Wardrop reported that two conventions between Armenia and Georgia had been signed on the previous day, one relating to customs duties, and the other to existing and future disputes. By the former there was to be freedom from customs duty for a period of three years, subject to the power of determining the Convention by giving six months&apos; notice after one year from ratification ; by the latter, failing the settlement of disputes, present and future, by agreement there must be compulsory arbitration. The validity of both Conventions was subject to the interested States ratifying them within a fortnight.Relations with Azerbaijan. On 13th November Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 131] that the following telegram, dated 13th November, had been received from the Armenian Prime Minister by himself and by the American, French, and Italian Missions : On the initiative of the Armenian Government there was fixed for 20th November an Armenian-Azerbaijan Conference for the pacific settlement of the disputed terri-torial question.   Our delegates were ready to leave for the Conference.Meanwhile, to-day, urgent official information has been received of a general advance of Azerbaijan troops against Zangezur. For seven clays heavy sanguinary fighting has been taking iDlace in the districts of Khoznavar and Jioyandur, simul-taneously with an advance from direction of Nakhichevan.Such actions wholly contradict the declarations of the Azerbaijan Government that a peaceful solution or arbitration is desired by them, and render the proposed Conference superfluous; they also contradict the orders of the Peace Conference concerning (? interference with) the reunion of this disputed territory ; they contradict Colonel Haskell&apos;s agreement with Azerbaijan and the order established in Zangezur by the Supreme British command.....About 90 miles south-east of Taif on the main thoroughfare from Nejd into Yemen.
AUSTRIA.The General Situation. The following is taken from a despatch sent hy Mr. Li ml ley to Lord Curzon on 4th November : Although I have only been a few days at my post, I feel I ought to take advantage of a messenger leaving this afternoon to lay before your Lordship certain general features of the situation which are so evident and&quot; undisputed that no longer experi-ence of Vienna can modify one&apos;s opinion of them, and which are of so serious a nature that they should be taken into consideration without delay if a catastrophe is to -be avoided:  , -(I) The frontiers of German-Austria, &apos;as fixed by the Treaty of Peace, do not contain either sufficient agricultural land to feed the population for- more than a few months in the year, or sufficient coal to meet more than a fraction of their industrial and household needs. This is a plain state-ment of fact, and no intensified working of the few Austrian coal-mines nor any pressure on the peasantry of the provinces to part with -their produce can materially alter it. The production of the mines.could no doubt be increased, but the relief would be very slight. The peasants could furnish more to Vienna, but if they did so they would merely starve themselves later in the year without giving to the capital more than a small passing assistance. (2) Austria has neither the cash nor the credit, to obtain coal or food from beyond her borders. This is also self-evident. The war would, in any case, have brought Austria to bankruptcy; but the Treaty of Peace forbids her to pledge any of her few liquid assets to tide over her present difficulties. She proposed to raise credits on her works of art and her tobacco monopoly, but was forbidden to do so; and the reparation claims of the, treaty are such that no financial assistance is to be hoped from the usual sources.(3) The Border States, who are bound by their engagements to the Powers to provide Austria with coal, furnish, as a matter of fact, but a fraction of the quantities laid down. While it is obvious that these States have most serious internal difficulties to contend with, it is equally clear to any impartial observer that they make no serious efforts to meet their engage-men ts. The whole attitude of the Czecho-Slovak authorities, both in the matter of transit traffic and frontier regulations, is as harassing.to Austria as can well be imagined, and, so long as this attitude is maintained, no material relief can be expected either from Poland or Czecho-Slovakia.THE BALTIC.Relations with Soviet Russia. The following wireless message was sent to Mr. Chicherin on 9th November :  The Esthonian Foreign Minister informs Mr. Chicherin that representatives of * the Baltic States are meeting at Yurieff (Dorpat) on 9th November, in order to elucidate the question of peace with Soviet Russia and to determine in common the preliminary negotiations. The Esthonian Government, for their part, wish to confer with the Russian Soviet delegates on the question of the liberation of hostages and arrested persons, and they invite the Soviet delegates to Dorpat for 17th November.The Esthonian Government state once more that they have no aggressive intentions in regard to Soviet Russia. The recent military operations undertaken against the Soviet troops were only the direct, and ordinary development of the offensive begun by the Soviet troops almost before the Esthonian delegates had left Pskoff. As Soviet Russia had begun the attack, and as no truce had been made, the military operations continued, although in the interval the initiative had passed over to the Esthonian side.To this Mr. Chicherin replied on the following day saying that the assurances of the Esthonian Government that they had no aggressive intentions towards Soviet Russia, would have been more satisfactory if the Esthonian Government had not taken an active part in Yudenich&apos;s attack on Petrograd. He denied that the Soviet troops were the attackers, as the operations took place on Soviet Russian territory-, and the .Soviet troops were only defending themselves.   These assertions of the Esthonian
-Government and their delay in resuming negotiations were calculated to inspire the Soviet Government with doubt as to the sincerity of their peaceful intentions. The Russian Soviet Government, however, awaited the proposal of the Baltic Governments in regard to the date of the negotiations between these Governments and the Govern-ment of Soviet Russia. They agreed also to begin the Conference with the Esthonian Government at Dorpat on 17th November concerning the exchange of hostages. The Esthonian Government were requested to take steps for the safe passage of Mr. Litvinoff, the Soviet delegate, across the front at Isborsk on 16th November, and to guarantee his absolute inviolability as web1 as that of his escort.The Dor-pat Conference. Telegraphing on 15th November Colonel Tallents reported [No. 223] that the present position appeared to be as follows : The Letts were encouraged by their success against Bermondt and the Bolsheviks, and by their increasing military strength and efficiency. He had been told by the Foreign Minister that their one policy was to keep step with England. The Commander-in-Chief was strongly opposed to any dealings with the Bolsheviks. The Esthonians on the other hand were embarrassed by the Cabinet crisis, by the peace resolution of their Assembly, and by adverse military events. The Finns were abstaining, and the Lithuanians hardly counted, at present, in this question.Colonel Tallents added that the Boles had informed the chief Lettish represen-tatives that they would not take part in any negotiations.THE CAUCASUS.British High Commissioner with General Denikin.-On 14th November [No. 606] the Foreign Office informed Sir Percy Cox that Mr. H. G. Mackinder would shortly leave England for General Denikin&apos;s headquarters, as he had .been appointed British High Commissioner to act with that General.General Rowlandson&apos;s Proclamation. [F.C.R. iii., p. 4]. On 7th November, Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 120] that he had been informed by General Ixeyes that the proclamation attributed to General Rowlandson had actually been issued in the form in which it had appeared in Tiflis.COLUMBIA /;Adherence to the League of Nations, Telegraphing from Bogota on 7th November,. Lord Herbert Hervey reported [No. 54] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that a law had been passed authorizing Columbia to adhere to the League of Nations.CZECH O-SLOVAKLA.Situation in SZoua/cva.--Telegraphing from Prague on Kith November, Mr. Gosling; reported [No. 219] that he had been informed by Commander Barton that the Slovakian situation showed no improvement. There were signs of a definite move-ment to join Hungary, whilst the anti-Czech feeling was growing stronger among the Slovaks.FINLAND.Communist Propaganda. Telegraphing from Stockholm on 12th November,. Mr. Ramsay reported [No. 1413] that a Press telegram, dated Helsingfors, 8th November, stated that the Communists had established an agitation centre at Helsingfors from which pamphlets were distributed all over the country, and that espionage was being organized. They were endeavouring to introduce spies into-the City Guard, as well as into the telegraph and telephone central offices. Sabotage was recommended and especially the disorganization of the supply of foodstuffs. Carriers were to be used for correspondence and active agitation was to be carried on. among the troops.
The German Bill of Costs.-Telegraphing from Helsingfors on 9th November [No. 644], Sir Coleridge Kennard reported that Germany had presented her bill for the assistance of its army and navy, war material supplied, and military booty handed over to the Finnish authorities.   The total was 130,000,000 Finnish marks.Agreement with. Sweden. On 13th November Sir Coleridge Kennarcl reported [No. 653] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that an exchange of notes had taken place on 11th November between the Finnish and the Swedish Governments, providing that recent treaties between Sweden and Russia in regard to Finland should be considered as valid as between Finland and Sweden. Sir Coleridge added that he understood that since 1812 sixteen treaties between Russia and Sweden contained references to Finland, and were included in the above arrangement.FRANCE.The British Recognition of the Grand Duchess of Luxemburg. On 5th November Sir George Grahame reported [No. 1154] that he had made known to the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs the decision.of His Majesty&apos;s Government to recognize the Grand Duchess of Luxemburg, and that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had expressed astonishment at this act of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it having been understood that the two countries would act together in regard to such recognition. The Belgian GoA^ernment had told the French Government that they were not recognizing Her RoA-al Highness, and the French GoA*ernment had replied that they were not doing so either.On 14th November Lord Curzon instructed [No. 1257] Sir George Grahame to inform the French Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government were sincerely vexed at having given ground for the erroneous impression that they desired to go behind the backs of the French and Belgian Governments. He should express their sincere regret for having ov-erlooked the assurance which had been given that no such action should be taken without consultation with the French Government. The question had been suddenly raised by an enquiry of the Belgian Government as to avhether the King would be represented at the &quot;wedding of the Grand Duchess; from which enquiry the deduction was made that the Belgian Government had already recognized her.GERMANY.The Sehleswig Plebiscite. On 14th November the Foreign Office informed [No. 1197] Sir Ronald Graham, British Minister at The Hague, that it had been decided by the Supreme Council that allied troops should be sent to Schleswig for the purpose of maintaining order during the plebiscite.Eupen and Malmedy. A wireless message, sent out from Nauen on 12th November, states that the Yorwarts describes the refusal of the Supreme Council in Paris to allow a plebiscite to be held in Eupen and Malmedy as a. violation of the rights of these two districts, in which the majority of the inhabitants are German, and fresh mockery of the right of peoples to self-determination.Neio German Police. The following wireless message was despatched from Nauen on 12th November: The organization of the new German Police, which, according to Article 9 of the German Constitution, is a task belonging to the Reich is being planned on lines which would lea\Te to the individual States the appointment of the executive authorities. The unity of the police force would, however, be preseiwed by means of certain standard&quot; rules, equally applicable to all individual States. At the same time the homogeneous organization of a criminal police for the whole of Germany is contemplated. The establishment of the new police for the whole of Germany is all the more urgent as the conditions of security in Germany are bound to deteriorate when the total numbers of the Reichswehr, who up to now have largely done duty as police, are still further reduced, in accordance Avith the provisions of the Peace Treaty.ITALY.Fiume.-The following memorandum has been issued by the Foreign Office :-On 27th October Signor Nitti telegraphed to Mr. Lloyd George, addressing to him a pressing appeal to consider the serious internal situation in Italy, due in his 3-3 B
opinion to the attitude of the Allies in the Fiume question. This was destroying the control of the Italian Government over the Army and Navy. Signer Nitti appealed to Mr. Lloyd George to attest the moderation of his (Signor Nitti&apos;s) views and the-fact that he had always opposed any demand which he did not consider just. He insisted on the fact that the Fiume question had now become a sentimental one for Italy, and that Italians were humiliated to think that the Allies did not understand this. Italian demands were based on this, not on economic considerations. Signor Nitti asked Mr. Lloyd George to take into account the heavy sacriaces borne by Italy in the war, and, appealing to his friendship for Italy, begged him to take action at Washington to impress on the American Government the seriousness of the situation. Signor Nitti concluded by saying that to his mind the modest character of Signor Tittoni&apos;s demands made it difficult for him to understand why they were not accepted.On 31st October Mr. Lloyd George telegraphed in reply to Signor Nitti, through the British Ambassador in Borne, returning his cordial assurances of friendship. Mr. Lloyd George stated that it was impossible to ignore such an appeal and that he felt bound to help in the settlement of the Adriatic question without any further delay. For this reason he was sending an urgent personal telegram to President Wilson, reminding him of the great sacrifices borne by Italy in the war and the moderate character of the present Italian Governments demands as compared with those of their predecessors. In view of this, he was pressing on the American Government that they should try to meet the last Italian proposals.On the same day Mr. Lloyd George telegraphed tc-Lord Grey at Washington, asking him to press very strongly on the President the importance of not insisting on points which did not affect the principles at stake. Mr. Lloyd. George called attention to the moderation of the present Italian Government, and the necessity for responding to that moderation in order to avoid the danger of a revolution in Italy. The points on which the Italians were now insisting might seem small, but they had become points of honour. On the other hand they did not seem matters of vital importance to the Jugo-Slavs who would be satisfied by the control of the port of Fiume hy the League of Nations. For this reason Mr. Lloyd George urged that the President should accept the ideas (1) of a statute for Fiume, excluding the port;(2) of the annexation to Italy of a small strip of coast, so as to bring Italian territory up to the borders of the independent State of Fiume ;(3) that the diplomatic representation of the free town of Zara and the island of Lagosta should be assigned to Italy.MEXICO.British Grievances. [F.O.R. iii., p. 7.] Telegraphing from Mexico on 4th November,. Mr. Cummins reported [No. 396] that he had been assured by the Sub-Secretary that all restrictions in regard to passports had now been definitely withdrawn.In another telegram of the same date [No. 395] he said that the Sub-Secretaiy had discussed the question of grievances with him in general terms, and had declared, in regard to sequestrated property, that each case required individual study, and had promised to give that attention. The interview had been cordial, and the Sub-Secretary had expressed his readiness to do his best to ameliorate the relations between the two Governments, and had agreed that he, Mr. Cummins, should take up with him any matter which tended to improve those relations. Telegraphing again on the 10th [No. 402] he reported that he had received confidential intimations that the Mexican Government had resolved to renew friendly relations with us, and that these intimations had come from well-informed sources.POLAND.Bolshevik 0ffers.-Gn 3rd November [No. 37S, received by bag 16th November] Sir Horace Rumbold reported that he had heard that the Bolshevik Red Cross Commissioner (who formed part of the Red Cross Commission which was by way of negotiating the exchange of prisoners with the Polish Red Cross Commission) had made very attractive offers to the Poles.
RUMANIA.Ultimatum of the Supreme Council of the Allies. On 17th November Sir Eyre Crowe reported [No. 1576] that he had sent the following telegram to Mr. Rattigan : The following note was addressed by the Supreme Council yesterday to the Rumanian Government and sent to your French colleague. It has the character of an ultimatum : I. The Supreme Council has taken cognizance of the Rumanian reply elated 2nd November and signed by General Voitoianu and can only state that this note gives no satisfaction to the Allies and Associated Powers. This fact compromises the relations between Rumania and the Allies most seriously and the latter feel compelled to ask the Rumanian Government for a final reply;Since the beginning of the month of August, i.e., since the time when Rumanian troops occupied Budapest the Peace Conference has constantly asked Rumania to adopt an attitude in Hungary in keeping with the common principles of the Allies and the engagements by which they are mutually bound. With untiring patience based on the respect felt by the Allies for one another and on the hope that the Rumanian Government would finally recognize that it cannot with impunity disregard the principles and withdraw from the mutual engagements of the Allies, the Conference had attempted to maintain the bonds uniting the Allies and Rumania and to induce that Power to defer to decisions of the Supreme Council ; urgent demands to this effect were sent to the Bucharest Government on 4th, 5th, 7th, 14th, 23rd and 25th August, 5th September, 12th October, 3rd and 7th November. To show the importance it attached to obtaining a reply from Rumania, the Conference even instructed a special delegate,. Sir George Clerk, to proceed to Bucharest.The sole result of all these patient efforts was the reply of 2nd November which is conciliatory in tone, but negative in fact; ythe Note sets asideHe had said that his Government would he satisfied with the ethnographic frontier of Great Russia; all White Russia, including the eastern parts not yet occupied hy the Polish forces, to he allowed to exercise the right of self-determination in accordance with General PilsuclskPs declaration at Vilna.Such proposals seemed to indicate the imminent collapse of the Government which put them forward, but my informant did not think that the inference would be justified in the present case. lie thought that the Soviet Government was only trying to entangle Poland in a second treaty of Brest-Litovsk.The Baltic States. On 16th November Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 409] saying that he had been officially informed that the Letts and Esthonians had signified their intention of not concluding peace with the Bolsheviks without previous reference to the Bolish Government. &apos;Danzig. On 13th November Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 405] that the Polish Ministry for Foreign Affairs had sent him a French translation of the protocol of meetings held on the 3rd, 4th and 5th November between the representatives of the Danzig Wirtschafteverband and those of the Polish Danzig Committee. The Ministry pointed out that the meetings in question were not of an official nature, and that their results were therefore only intended to assist in the establishment of a future, convention, which in accordance with Article 104 of the Treaty of Versailles would be negotiated by the principal Allied and Associated Powers between Poland and the free City of Danzig.The work of the&quot; meetings was divided between three committees, which dealt respectively with (a) questions concerning navigation and communications ; (6) industrial and commercial questions ; and (c) financial questions.Jewish Emigration. According to a wireless message sent from Nauen on 15th November, a commission of 1 the Warsaw Emigration Society is leaving (? Warsaw) with a view to making preparations for the emigration of Polish Jews from Congress Poland. It is considered that this emigration will assume large proportions as soon as the proposed alterations in the political conditions of Poland have been carried out.   Emigration to America is to take place via Danzig.
the two first of the three questions raised [the acceptance of the frontiers fixed by Supreme Council, the signature of the Treaty of Peace with Austria and of the Treaty concerning minorities; the settlement of the-position in Hungary] and only replies to the third.Even on this point none of the satisfaction demanded is really given.&apos; The principle of the cessation of requisitioning in Hungary is indeed admitted as also the institution of an Inter-Allied Commission at Budapest to carry these principles into practice, but in making this concession Rumania does not agree that the Commission can unload goods already accumulated in Hungarian trucks but which have not yet passed the bridges where examination takes place or that it should be autho-. rizeel to receive complaints and to enquire into abuses committed by Rumanian military authorities. The withdrawal of Rumanian troops was only accepted as &apos; far as Theiso with no acceptance by Rumania of the decision of the Powers for the evacuation of the whole of the Hungarian territory and for the withdrawal behind the frontiers finally fixed by that decision, which were immediately accepted by other neighbouring-States (Czechs and Serbs).To sum up, for three months and a half the Rumanian Government has continued to negotiate (? with) the Peace Conference as Power to Power,, taking into account no other rights or interests but its own and refusing to accept the . burdens of solidarity though wishing to benefit by the advantages thereof.The Conference makes a last appeal to the discernment of the Rumanian Government and the Rumanian people before taking the serious (? step-of) breaking off all relations with Rumania. Its right to be heard is essentially based on the fact that it is to the victory of the Allies that Rumania owes the inestimable advantage of the reconstruction of her national unity with double her former territory and population. Without the immense sacrifices of the Allies Rumania would now be decimated, ruined, and conquered beyond all hope. Rumania joined the struggle for her freedom at the end of the second year of the war, and that condition-ally ; it is true she made great sacrifices and underwent a severe trial, but she finally consented to treat independently with the enemy&quot; and to subject herself to his terms. Her liberty and her victory as well as her future are clue to the Allies.How can such a situation be so quickly lost sight of and forgotten by Rumanian statesmen ?In any event the Supreme Council can wait no longer; it invites the Rumanians to agree to the following, without discussion of reservations or conditions : 1. To evacuate Hungarian territory, withdrawing&apos; within the final frontiers fixed by Conference.2. To accept the formation of the Inter-Allied Commission for the suppression of, the checking, and inquiry into the requisitions made in Hungary since the commencement of the Rumanian occupation.3. To sign the Treaty with Austria and the minorities in the manner stated in Supreme Council&apos;s Note of 12th October.The Supreme Council will wait eight days for an affirmative or negativereply from the Rumanian Government. Should, this reply fail to give satisfaction to the Supreme Council of theAllies, the latter have decided to notify, to Rumania that she will haveseparated herself from them.    They will request her immediately to recallher delegates from the Peace Conference and will withdraw their diplomatic missions from Bucharest. As regards the  settlement of frontiers. Rumania will thus by her ownaction forfeit all claims to the support of the Powers as  also  to  the recognition of her rights by the Conference. The Supreme Council of the Allies would experience the deepest regret.were it obliged to break with Rumania entirely, although its patiencehas been tried to the utmost.I have to request that you will at once concert with your colleagues to take the-necessary steps for the presentation of this Note to the Rumanian Government.
Relations with General Denikin.-Qn 5th November [No. 494, received 14th November] Mr. Rattigan, telegraphing from Bucharest, reported that the Russian Minister had told him that General Denikin had now authorized him (the Minister) to aive an assurance to the Rumanian Government that he wished to establish the friendliest relations with Rumania, and that as regards Bessarabia he agreed that the question must be settled by diplomacy and not by sword.The Alleged Tyranny in Transylvania. The following telegram was sent to Astoria on 12th November by Mr. Rattigan and repeated to the Foreign Office [No. 502] :-In the course of a conference which I had to-day with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs I again represented to them the disastrous impression produced by the countless reports of Rumanian tyranny in Transylvania. Both, indignantly denied the truth of these reports and asked me to make a personal tour of enquiry In Transylvania, I replied .1 could not absent myself for the necessary period, but that Sir George Clerk, whose fair-mindedness was recognized by all sides, had said he feared there was a good deal of truth in the reports as to attempts to Humanize Hungarian elements in Transylvania. He had mentioned arbitrary arrests, expulsion of Hungarian citizens and similar abuses. The Prime Minister replied that a far-reaching Hungarian conspiracy had been discovered in Transylvania, of which proofs could be shown. Practically the whole of the Gendarmerie was involved. The existence of a widespread Bolshevik organization had also been brought to light. Naturally many arrests had been necessary, but no brutality had been used. The only expulsions which had been carried out were in cases of countless agitators, chiefly Jewish and Bolshevik, who had flooded the country since the war. Not a single bond fide (? Hungarian) resident had been expelled except in case of proved complicity in anti-Rumanian plots.I said that if Sir George Clerk accepted the truth of these stories, there must be more in them than they appeared to think. Was it not possible that local authorities had been acting without knowledge of the Rumanian Government ? They categorically denied the possibility of this.RUSSIA.Fuel Crisis in Soviet Russia.. The following is a translation of a wireless message from Moscow, dated 13th November: In connexion with the fuel crisis the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party has circulated a letter among all party organizations, exhorting every one to exert all their efforts for the struggle against the new enemy. The Central Committee states :   We are crushing Kolchak, we have vanquished Yuclenich, we continue to advance successfully on Denikin, we have greatly increased the collection of grain, but the fuel shortage threatens to destroy Soviet work. The fuel crisis has now become the most vital question, but this difficulty can be overcrme; to achieve this, we must concentrate all our forces against our main enemy, i.e., the fuel crisis. The Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party is convinced that all party organizations and all members of the party who during two years have proved their ability and competence to solve difficult problems on revolutionary lines, will also be able to surmount this difficulty. The Central Committee proposes the following measure : to start a wide propaganda campaign, especially in the villages, to explain to the masses the significance of the fuel question for the Soviets, while the introduction of compulsory labour for the whole population, or a mobilization of specified classes for work in connexion with the preparation and transport of fuel, must be resorted to without delay. We have raised discipline in the army, we must now raise labour discipline. The &quot; Labour Saturdays &quot; must be devoted to fuel work. All instructions connected Avith the fuel crisis must be carried out, not under threat of punishment, but in accordance with the promptings of conscience. All affairs bearing on the fuel question must be dealt with promptly and with accuracy. All cases of delay must be punished severely. -The Central Committee is assured that all comrades will do their utmost to carry these instructions out exactly and speedily.[Note. This proclamation Avas referred to by the Prime Minister in his speech in the House of Commons on 17th November.]The Volunteer Army and Galicia. Telegraphing from Odessa on 11th November  No. 46], Mr. Lowdon reported that an arrangement had been reached between the 3-3 o
Volunteer Army and Galicia by which it was agreed that Ukraina should be con-si clered part of one indivisible Russia and that all the Galician troops now there should be placed at the disposal of the Volunteer Army for service against the Bolsheviks. In regard to Galician home affairs, the Volunteer Army had declared that it had no intention of interfering therein.Siberia.Proposed Acquisition of Forests and Mines by Japan. Telegraphing from Peking on 3rd November [No. 565], Sir John Jordan reported the receipt of information from the British Consul at Harbin to the effect that a Japanese syndicate had been formed with the object of acquiring from General Semenoff all forests and mines in the district between Lake Baikal and the River Argun. The greater part of the capital would be provided by the Japanese Government.Omsk. Quoting a Bolshevik report from the Wireless Press dated 15th November, The Times of 17th November announces the fall of Omsk as follows : The advance of the Red Army in Siberia continues -unchecked, and Omsk, which up to last week was the seat of Admiral ivoIcliak&apos;s Government, was occupied by the Bolsheviks on Saturday.Bolshevik report, 15th November : In the- petro pavlovsk region, during an engagement our troops occupied Omsk. The enemy is retreating, in an easterly direction.Along the petro pavlovsk-Koktchetav road we (the Red right wing) continue our advance.Along the Siberian railway we captured an armoured train and two battalions of infantry.   At Marianovka station [west of Omsk] we captured 407 prisoners.North of the Siberian railway our troops during an engagement occupied Bozhenovskoe, taking many prisoners and machine guns.Turkestan.Afghan Ascendancy.  On 3rd November the Viceroy transmitted [No. 14923] a message dated 31st October from General Malleson, reporting that he had received information of the complete ascendancy gained by the Afghans in the whole region from Merv to Kushk, where they were doing everything to conciliate the Turkmans. None of the latter understood the situation, or whether Bolsheviks and Afghans are really friends or enemies, but it was recognized that the Afghans controlled the local situation, and held the position everywhere as protectors of Mahomedans.Merv. The Viceroy transmitted on 6th November a further message from General Malleson reporting the arrival in Merv of a small detachment of Afghan troops who had brought no guns. The Bolsheviks appeared outwardly friendly, and supplied the Afghans with food and money, but the Bolshevik officials really resented the arrival of the Afghans. These say that the object of their visit is to ensure the fulfilment, of Bolshevik promises, whereby considerable territory south of Merv was to be ceded on the condition that the Afghans made war on the British. The Bolsheviks question the performance of their part of the bargain by the Afghans, and are not disposed towards the cession of territory. The Afghans claim &quot;up to Merv,&quot; and announce their intention to have it, and pending recognition of their claim, they will give no armed assistance to the Bolsheviks.On 13th November the Viceroy transmitted [No. 15337] a telegram from General Malleson, dated 9th November, stating that he had received information that a Bolshevik plenipotentiary (presumably Suric) had arrived at Merv from Tas liken d with 12 delegates. The presence of Afghan troops in the Merv area was causing much anxiety in Bolshevik circles.SWITZERLAND.Attitude towards the League of Nations.- Mr. Russell telegraphed from Berne on Saturday, 15th November as follows :  gjzx ?MThe Minister for Foreign Affairs, who delivered a great speech in the Chamber on Thursday in the debate which is to decide Switzerland&apos;s future action, assured me
last niglit that he felt confident of a large majority in favour of adherence. He hoped that the division would take place before the end of next week and that Switzerland would thus be in a position to notify her adherence within the prescribed two months and to enjo3T the advantages granted to the original members of the League. Though naturally pleased with the turn of events, due in no small measure to his own efforts on behalf of the League, the Minister for Foreign Affairs displayed considerable anxiety in regard to the action of the Senate in Washington. If that body rejected the Peace Treaty, or even insisted on reservations, the impression created in this country would, according to him, be,deplorable, and might easily lead to the demand for a further discussion in the Swiss Chamber. But even in that event, he harboured no doubts concerning the final result, as Swiss public opinion was now increasingly in favour of the League.SYRIA.The General Situation. Colonel Meinertzhagen telegraphed [No. 493] from Cairo on 6th November that some slight change in the general situation had resulted from the evacuation which was taking -place. While the better educated and the business element was reconciled to French control, there was an increasing majority who resented it. In Damascus an anti-European feeling had replaced an anti-French feeling, and armed demonstrations frequently occurred. No immediate disturbances were anticipated, but there was the danger of some unfortunate incident causing an outbreak of violence.TURKEY.The Occupation of the Smyrna District. Sir E. Crowe reported from Paris on 12th November that the occupation of the Meander Valley had been considered by the Supreme Council that day, and that M. Clemenceau had stated definitely that the French Government felt unable to furnish a contingent to take part in the proposed inter-Allied occupation of the Aidin region. As Sir E. Crowe understood from his Military Adviser that the War Office maintained their refusal to send a British battalion if the French sent none, he informed the Supreme Council to that effect.

Venizelos was being notified accordingly.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.The following reports have been received : Pence Conference. W.C.P. 1369.
