FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Situation at Kabul. The Viceroy of India telegraphed [No. 163] on 25th February, that reports from Kabul were that everything in Kabul was normal up to 12th February, and that there had been no signs of military activity. A Durbar had been held on 5th February, at which Russians were present, and the general opinion had been expressed against any Bolshevik force, however composed, being permitted to enter Afghanistan. At the Friday prayers in the Kabul mosque, read recently for the first time in Persian instead of in Arabic, the names of the Sultan of Turkey and of the Amir had been coupled together.ARABIA.The Hejaz and Holland. The High Commissioner of Egypt telegraphed [No. 171] on 27th February that King Hussein had absolutely refused to recognize the newly appointed Dutch Consul until the Hejaz Government had been recognized by the Dutch Government.On 5th March Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 189] to Lord Allenby that the Netherland-Indian Government had decided to send a native physician to Jeddah in time for the forthcoming pilgrimage, and offered to place him at the disposal of the &quot; Chief of the British Quarantine Service.&quot; It was proposed to accept the participa-tion of medical officers of other Powers concerned, provided it was clearly understood that British control was maintained, and that no responsibility could be accepted for the attitude of King Hussein towards other representatives.AUSTRIA.Agreement with Czecho-Slovakia. On 21st February Mr. Lindley despatched the following message [No. 98] from Vienna :-The Italian Minister read to me to-day an agreement he stated to have been drawn up during the visit of-the State Chancellor to Prague. He did not believe it had been actually signed, but was convinced that it existed and was considered binding by the two Governments.The following is the gist of the agreement as taken down by me at the time :  Professor Mazaryk and Dr. Renner, representing Czecho-Slovakia and Austria, having met in order to conclude an agreement of defence and mutual aid, have settled the following on the basis of the Austrian Treaty of Peace, which is recognized as binding by both parties : (1) In case of an armed attack on Czecho-Slovakia or in the event of that country being in a state of war, Austria will break off diplomatic relations immediately with the country at war with Czecho-Slovakia, and will refuse the former any transit of troops or Avar material through her territory.(2) Austria, on being called upon by Czecho-Slovakia, will take the necessary steps to put at her disposal all the troops and war material she possesses by virtue of the Treaty of St. Germain.(3) Austria engages to work her whole war industry for the benefit of Czecho-Slovakia, and to forward to the latter war material in pi-eferenpe over any other commodities if so directed.(1) Austria engages to afford transit facilities and transport for the Czecho-Slovak. army and war material across her territory.(5) Czecho-Slovakia promises the same in favour of Austria.(6) The necessary details will form the subject of negotiation and be added to this agreement.(7) The agreement enters at once into force and the question of ratification will be discussed later.
oThe Italian Minister also informed me that he knew for a fact that a treaty of --alliauce had been concluded between France and S.H.S. State. This was cate-gorically denied in to-day&apos;s Press by the French Legation here on instructions from Paris,  -v.- .      .       m       ...I should mention that the Italian. Minister is Marquis Torrefta, who accompanied Signor Nitti recently to Paris and London. I knew him well at Petrograd and Archangel, and he is certainly one of the most intelligent and reliable Italian diplomatists.Confirmation of the existence of an agreement was received from Sir George Clerk, who telegraphed [No. 38] from Prague on 29th February that he had been so informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The substance was that both Govern-ments would resist attempts to restore a monarchy or the rule of Federal States. While both Austria and Czecho-Slovakia were to retain their own complete sovereignty, .a system of economic, commercial and, perhaps, political treaties would be aimed at. The sufferings of the Czechs under the Austria-Hungarian Federation formed an effectual bar against their considering any fresh Union of States at present. From the military aspect Austria undertook not to help Hungary should she attack Czecho-Slovakia, but to assist the latter in every way short of military co-operation. On the other hand, Czecho-Slovakia would assist Austria by force of arms against Hungary should the occasion arise, but only if asked to do so by the Allied Poioers.THE BALTIC STATES.Resignation of the Finnish Cabinet. On 3rd March Lord Acton reported [No. 230] the resignation of the Finnish Cabinet. Telegraphing again three days later [No. 212] he notified that the formation of a Cabinet had been entrusted to Dr. Erich, a well-known pro-German member of the Right and judicial adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 7th March he telegraphed again [No. 245] saying that Mr. Holsti would remain at the Foreign Office. He was a Left Progressive, and the majority of the Cabinet would also be Progressives.The Conference [F.C.R., xi., p. 2]. On 2nd March Colonel Tallents telegraphed [No. 79] from Riga as follows : According to the latest information the Poles have not invited Lithuania to send a representative to the forthcoming Bolshevik peace discussion in Warsaw. This is comprehensible, having regard to events at the Helsingfors Conference, but regrettable on wider grounds. The Lettish Foreign Secretary states that the Finnish, Esthonian, -and Lettish delegates will hold a secret conference at Riga on their return, and promises to invite the Lithuanian Foreign Secretary.If the Lithuanians are excluded from the consultation they are likely to seek peace in advance of the Poles. The question of Germans trading with Bolshevik Russia, though bound to arise in any negotiations affecting Lithuania, would be especially acute in case of a separate peace. I do not think that any representations to the Lithuanian Government would long prevent German access through Lithuania to Russia even if prevention Avere desired.On 1st March Sir II. Rumbold reported from Warsaw [No. .137] that a member of his staff had been informed by a friend in the Polish Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Norwegian Government had wished to participate in the Conference to be: held in Warsaw of representatives of the various. States bordering on Russia. The Polish Government, however, thinking that Norway had more subjects of dispute Avith Finland than with Russia, had been unwilling to accede to this suggestion lest the Conference should become involved in protracted debates between the Norwegian and the Finnish representatives on subjects having little or nothing to do with the Russian question.On 5th March Sir Horace Rumbold further reported [No. 115] that the Minister lor Foreign Affairs admitted that Rumanian delegates had been invited to AVarsaw^, with a view of their becoming acquainted Avith the conditions on which the Polish Government Avould consider peape negotiations with the Bolsheviks. He proposed to hold a separate conversation- with the delegates from each of the different countries, and not to let the meeting at Warsaw take the form of a Conference. The conditions to be put forward by the Polish Government: as a basis for peace negotiations Avere being translated for early communication to the British and French GpA&apos;ernments. If the Allied Governments &quot;then saw no objection, he would notify the Soviet Govern-
,similar of Ins readiness to open negotiations with them. : He intended to take the views of tdre^rnn^and the Letts with regard to the Polish peace condition as to the desirability-of senate negotiations between Poland and the Soviet Government, rath erthaii m foniunction with Finland and Latvia. Should Poland enter into peace negotiations ^Xthe Bdllmviks, it was his intention that they should be conducted m Russia, so-Is not to Wish an opportunity for Bolshevik propaganda to be spread in Poland.BRAZIL.Preference to the United States. Sir Ralph Paget telegraphed [No. 32] on 26th February that he had learned privately that the Brazilian Government were enquiring of their Ambassador in London regarding the preference accorded by us to our Colonies. The argument they proposed to put forward was that if we arbitrarily accord preference to countries, which-judging by the position we took up at the Peace Conference are recognized as separate nations, Brazil is justified in doing the same, and that therefore our complaint about preference accorded to the United States falls to the ground.THE CAUCASUS.Azerbaijan and Turkey. On 23rd February Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 115] that an official denial had been published by the Azerbaijan Government&apos; in regard to alleged agreements with Turkey-. No&apos;such agreements, secret or otherwise, had, they asserted, been concluded, nor had there been any negotiations with a view to an agreement.Azerbaijan and Armenia. Telegraphing on 28th February Mr. Wardrop said [No. 123] that he had received information from Baku that the Azerbaijan Minister for Foreign Affairs had telegraphed to the Armenian Government as follows :- The Azerbaijan Minister.for Foreign Affairs continues acting in.strict conformity with the agreement of 23rd November and has not (group undecypherable) advanced against Zangezur or elsewhere. But since 23rd November Armenian troops in that district have destroyed about twenty Mussulman villages and since 19th January Armenian troops with irregulars had been marching to Shusha, destroying villages. The Azerbaijan Government are sending a small force to prevent further destruction -of life and property and restore the state of things existing before 23rd November.CHINA.v. Tibet [F.C.R,., x., p. 5]. On 28th February Sir John Jordan announced [No. 109] that he had been, informed in writing by the Chinese Government that, in view of many internal issues, they did not regard the time as yet ripe for a settlement of the Tibetan question, with regard to which they cherish the same hopes as ourselves. The remarks made by the Vice (? Minister of Justice) at the interview on 3rd December were merely expressions of private opinion and were in no way meant as a declaration that China was willing to reopen (? final) negotiations forthwith or desired the selection of Lhassa as the venue for such negotiations.- CZECHOSLOVAKIA.P-epatriation of Prisoners. Mr. Grant Watson reported by telegram [No. 214J. from Copenhagen on 25th February that a Czecho-Slovak Delegation had been negotiating with Litvinoff since 10th February, but their negotiations had not so far made   much  progress.     The   Czechs desired that 20,000 to 30,000 Czechs in &quot;&quot;European Russia should be concentrated in special camps, and arrangements made &apos; for their repatriation, and they wished to send a Delegation to Russia to study-this problem.   Litvinoff had agreed to this visit on condition that a Bolshevik Delegation was allowed to visit Russian prisoners of war in Bohemia, but the Czech Government . had not consented to this, although, they- had agreed to repatriate the Russians.   It seemed probable that the Czech Delegation would go to Esthonia to meet a Bolshevik Red Delegation who are in charge of interests of prisoners of war in Russia.
oDENMARK.League&apos;of Nations. On 5&apos;tli March Mr. Grant Watson telegraphed [No. 264] that the King of Denmark had signed a law providing for the adherence of Denmark to the Leae-ue of Nations, and that a formal notification would be made by the Danish Minister in London on 9th March.GERMANY.The Plebiscite Area in Silesia [F.C.R., xi., p. 3].-On 29t.h February Colonel Percival reported [No. P. 5] that an amnesty had been granted to political offenders and to persons convicted for minor offences against the food regulations, forest laws, bvelaws, &amp;c, where the offence was not of a serious nature and where the offenders had not been previously convicted. Prisoners convicted by the French military COurt-martiab benefit under this amnesty and are being released forthwith. -Relations with Russia.-Telegraphing on 4th March Lord Kilmarnock stated [No. 92],that the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly had adopted the following resolutions : - -(I) The decision of the Government to enter into negotiations with a delegate of the Soviet Government for the exchange of prisoners of war is approved.(2) The intention of the economic and industrial circles to send a commission to examine the economic situation in Russia is welcomed. The Government is recom-mended to facilitate the execution of this project in order to prepare for an early resumption of trade-relations.Activities of Turkish Agents. On 4th March Lord Kilmarnock telegraphed [No. 94] that reports of a reliable character regarding the activities of Turkish agents in Berlin had been received by General Malcolm. There appeared to be a pro-pagauda bureau which was a centre for refugees from Asia Minor and Turkey ; and plans had been made for sending messengers to Afghanistan, and India. Among the agents referred to were Talaat and Enver.German Industry and Economic Renascence. A wireless message from Norddeich, dated 1st March, gives the following account of the Leipzig Fair : The number of visitors to the Leipzig Fair has already reached 90,000. Eleven thousand firms have exhibited samples of goods, as compared with an attendance of 1,500 at the last autumn fair. Representatives of 30 German and foreign newspapers have inspected the fair, in order to get a personal idea of the productive capabilities of German industry. Among buyers foreign countries are strongly represented. There is a remarkable influx of representatives of Paris stores, besides numerous visitors from Germany7 and the border countries. Numerous buyers are also notified from Spain and America.A further wireless message, dated 6th March, records that the Minister of Works, Schlicke, has stated that he is much impressed by the Leipzig Fair, and now feels that Germany is taking steps forwards and upwards, and that in consequence of her diligence and ability she will regain a world position in the economic system, and, moreover, working with machinery of the latest type, so surprisingly good is the progress made that it is now clear that German industry cannot be kept back by the scarcity and. expensiveness of raw material. Factories producing heretofore war material have been changed into industries producing useful machinery, showing Germaiiy&apos;s ability to adapt herself to changed times.GUATEMALA.The President and his Opponents [F.G.R,, x., p. 6]. Telegraphing on 3rd March [No. 16] Mr. Armstrong said that the President of the Republic had called a special Session of Congress to consider a measure, similar to that just passed by the United States Senate, for the prurpOse of dealing with Bolshevism. There were no Bolsheviks in Guatemala, and the real object was to enable the President to deal -summarily with his political opponents; the Bill in consequence had met with some opposition, but it was felt that the President might force it through Congress. The &quot;whole country. was practically against the President, who was making extensive military preparations, having begun to realize the seriousness of the situation. 13-2 - B
HUNGARY.Hungarian Communists.--On 25th February, Mr. Hohler sent the followiiio-telegram [No. 126] from Budapest: The Hungarian Government informs me that Bela Kun. and other Hungarian Communists are now free, and that several of them are actively agitating, especially in Pressburg. Poganyi and Kunfi are the chief, with Wibtich, leader of the Socialist woiimen&apos;s party. The Government have reason to fear that the Czech authorities are shutting their eyes to these proceedings, wishino-that, when the outbreak comes, which it is expected with great certainty to do in a few days, the Hungarian population, but, particularly the Intelligentsia, will be especially exposed to the attacks of the Communists, and will be driven out and scattered.They earnestly beg that a British monitor may be sent there in order to prevent-excesses.The Food Situation. Mr. Hohler reported by telegram [No. 136] on 28th February that there was no change in the food situation as regarded Serbia. Sir A. You no-might, he thought, still safely use the argument of mortality caused by the&apos;dearth. For two days in the previous week no rations had been available. The malnutrition of children was producing deplorable results. At that moment he himself was unable to obtain flour. The price of food had increased 50 per cent, within the previous three weeks. It must be clearly understood this situation would continue aggravated until the next harvest. Of course the real corrective for it would be the supply of raw materials, so that the workmen could be again employed, and this would relieve not merely the economic, but also the political situation. From Rumania also nothing had come in.Serbian Withdrawal. In a telegram [No. 139] dated 29th February, Mr. Holder stated that the Hungarian Government had received information that the Serbian troops at Baja [nearly due south of Budapest], in anticipation of the withdrawal, were interning large numbers of people, collecting a war indemnity of (? 11) million kronen, and clearing out warehouses, schools and public offices, and that cattle also were being carried off. They solicited the despatch, of Inter-Allied representatives for the purpose of preventing such action.ITALY.liiot at Milan. On 2nd March Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 76] that a serious riot had occurred at Milan on 29th February. Wounded soldiers were holding a meeting supported by the Chamber of Labour, and the police, in trying&apos; to stop a demonstration, killed two men and woundedTl. Workmen paraded the streets, and a general strike for 2-1 hours had been proclaimed in consequence of the above incidents, but the Rome newspapers reported the decision of the Chamber of Labour in favour of the resumption of work that day.NORWAY.League of Nations. On 5th March Sir Mansfeldt Findlay telegraphed [No. 11] that after a debate lasting two dajTs, in which arguments for and against adhesion to the League of Nations were thoroughly discussed, the report of Committee recommending adhesion was finally accepted hy the Norwegian Parliament on the ^previous day by 100 votes to 20, and that he had been informed that a courier with the instrument of adhesion would leave on the morrow for Newcastle.PALESTINE.French Activity in Palestine. Colonel Meinertzhagen reported by telegram [No. 15] of 2nd March, that demonstrations with the object of protesting against Zionism and of demanding the unity of Syria, had taken place at Jerusalem and other centres on 27th February. These had been organized by the Moslem-Christian League, and had passed off quietly. Undoubtedly they owed their origin to French instigation and guidance. From the evidence that had come before him Colonel Meinertzhagen had satisfied himself that French propaganda had greatly increased in Palestine during the previous two months, and was working actively for the object
stated above. He attributed to the French representative at Jerusalem the motive power in these propaganda, and remarked - that French activity in Palestine which had been suspended at our. request some months ago, had attained recrudescence since General GouraucFs arrival and FeisaPs return. Colonel Meinertzhagen Avas of opinion that the French aimed at upsetting British administration and the policv of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the outset, and submitted the desirability of making a strong protest to the French Government before more harm was clone. He had the concurrence of the Chief Administrator in this.PANAMA. .&apos;Strike of Canal Employes.-On 1st March. Mr. Bennett telegraphed [No. 11] from Panama that, after months of agitation for better conditions, the coloured emploves of the Panama Canal, numbering 17,000, of Avhom 90 per cent, were British&quot;West Indians and the rest mostly French, had struck work on 24th february. In order to break the deadlock, there being no prospect of agreement, he had&quot; offered, on 26th February, to investigate the grievance and present the men&apos;s case officially to the Canal authorities, provided that work was resumed immediately. The Governor of the Canal had accepted his offer, subject to a time limit, after which rates of pay would be reduced. The men had agreed to accept after the time had expired, provided that this penalty was not imposed. The Governor, however, refused the extension, and the strike continued, with no immediate prospect of a settlement. The handling of ships&apos; cargoes and coaling operations were somewhat delayed, but the actual transiting of the Canal was proceeding normally.PERSIA.The Bolsheviks. In the course of a telegram [No. 83] sent from Teheran on 21st February, Sir Percy Cox, dealing with the question of Bolshevism, said that up to the present he had not believed that the Bolsheviks had serious intentions of aggression against Persia, but late developments made it unsafe to assume this any longer. The position was that many small parties of Bolsheviks and some well-known terrorists had already entered Persia, and papers which had been seized disclosed a large organization. Should the Bolsheviks, he said, carry their aggression into Persia it would be because they regarded Persia as one of the shortest routes to London, and not from auy hostility towards the Persian Government, in regard to whom they had in fact always professed the most benevolent intentions.RUSSIA.Message for M. Ghicherin [F.C.R., xi., page 8].-On 28th February Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 76] to Mr. Porter at Reval requesting him to transmit the following to M. Chicherin : I have just receiAred your wireless message, which it is now too late for me to communicate to the North Russian Government, but I presume you will instruct the officer commanding your troops in North Russia to communicate your terms to any Anti-Bolshevik forces which may still be under arms. I haA^e telegraphed your message to Alexanclrovsk for communication to the Revolutionary Government apparently established at Murmansk, with AA-hom you haA&apos;e presumably not yet established telegraphic communication.SERBIA.ISIew Cabinet. In a Despatch dated 20th February [No. 62], Sir Alban Young-enclosed the following list of the neAV Cabinet:---Minister President and Minister for the Constituente : Stoyan M. Protitch. Minister of Foreign Affairs : Dr. Ante Trumbitch. Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs : Miroslav Spalaykovitch. Minister of Interior : Marko Trifkovitch. Minister of Agriculture : Dr. Rashkar. 13-2 C
minister of Education : M. Trifunovitch.Minister of Finance : Dr. V. Vankovitok.Minister of Communications : M. Koroshec.Minister of -Justice : Momtchilo Nintehitch.Minister of Public Works : Yoca Yovanovitch.Minister of Posts and Telegraphs : Dr. M. Drinkovitch.Minister of Religions : Franyo Yankoviteh.Minister of Social Policy : Ivan Krnic (transferred 21st February to Minister ofAgrarian Reform).   Dr. Jura Schurmine (present Minister). Minister of Commerce and Industry : Stoyau Ribarac.Minister of Forests and Mines : Pralil Bey Hrasuica (resigned 21st February),Ivitza Kovatchovitoh (present Minister). Minister of Agrarian Reforms: Dr. A. Ilanjek (resigned 21st February).   IvanKrnic (present Minister). Minister of War: General Branko Yovanovitch. Minister of Food : Aleksa Stanishitch. Minister of Health : Dr. Slavko Miletitch.Sir Alban pointed out that, when analysed according to nationalities, the Cabinet was composed of 11 Serbs, 1 Croats, 3 Slovenes and 1 Dalmatian.Telegraphing on Oth March [No. 6FJ he said that the President of the Council had declared the policy of the new Government in the Chamber that morning. With regard to the Adriatic question, he had said that they7 knew this could not be settled quite in the manner which would be the most just and most advantageous for the two parties in the dispute, having in view their future relations and the peace of the world. The situation had been complicated by several mistakes, not on the side, of Jugo-Slavia. The continued occupation of Fiume by D&apos;Annunzio was the great obstacle standing in the way of a happy- issue out of the difficult situation which had arisen. It placed Jugo-Slavia in a condition of great inequality vis-a-vis Italy. The two parties in the dispute should be placed on an equality, otherwise the party who had obtained the material and momentary advantage would be tempted to convert what was an essentially7 illegal state of things into a legal actuality.With regard to the Albanian question, the President said that the best solution would be to leave to the Albanians themselves, in concert with their neighbours, the care of regulating their relations under the control of the League of Nations,-SWEDEN.League of Nations. On (3th March [No. 67] Mr. Barclay notified the departure of a messenger with full powers authorizing the Swedish Minister in London to present to the Secretariat of the League of Nations a declaration of Sweclen&apos;s accession thereto. He had already reported [No. 61] that the Bill had passed the Second Chamber without reservations by7 152 votes to 67.SWITZERLAND;League of Nations. Telegraphing on 3rd March Mr. Russell announced [No. 32] . that the&apos; National Council had that morning decided, by 111 votes against 55, in favour of entering the League of Nations and dropping the American clause. ^SYRIA.The General Situation. On 7th March Lord Allenby reported [No. E.A. 3001] that according to information received from his liaison officer the present political situation in Damascus was acute. The Emir Feisal found himself in the position of being compelled to convoke the Syrian Congress, which he believed would serve as a vent for the great existing excitement; he believed, too, that he might possibly7 be able to maintain peace.The Congress, however, intended not only &quot;to demand that the promises of inde-pendence made by the Peace Conference should be ratified, but also to declare the complete independence of Svria and to crowii the Emir Feisal as its king.   Peisal
himself considered that he would be disowned by.the people and that there would be an immediate outbreak of hostilities against us and the French if he should refuse either to convene the Congress or to accept the crown. He lirgently requested to know what line the British Government wished him to take. Intense excitement existed/and Lord Allenby feared that it was beyond FeisaPs power to resist the national feeling ; he had, however, managed to postpone the conference from the 6th -until the 10th or .11th March.TURKESTAN.Mere-On 20th February [No. 2311] the &quot;Viceroy of India transmitted a. message which had been despatched from Merv ou 5th February aud forwarded by General Malleson on the 18th. The agent at Merv said that that place was-quite different from what it had been a few months ago; all injustice had been abolished by the new officials and compensation for damage was being paid by the Bolsheviks. The Turcomans, therefore, were freely bringing their produce to market, being assured of payment. These changes were attributed by the people to General lvuropatkin [F.C.R., xi, p. 10], whose presence in Turkestan, General Malleson added, had been confirmed by Polish prisoners of war. These prisoners had also stated that General Brusiloff (probably the well-known General of this name) was at Skobeleff.The information regarding the presence of Generals Kuropatkin and Brusiloff has been confirmed by a wireless message intercepted at Cracow, which stated that they were working for the Soviet Government in the administration of Turkestan.Anti-British Propaganda- -On 2nd March the &quot;Viceroy reported [No. 2792] that the tone of the Tashkend wireless continued to be strongly anti-British. For example, a recent Press message had given extracts from the Bolshevik Press of Baku attributing the high prices throughout the Caucasus to the British, and accusing the latter of manipulating the exchange. The same message also gave a long violent proclamation denouncing the stranglers of the East and imploring the down-trodden Orient to procure the annihilation of these accursed oppressors by striking simul-taneous blows in Teheran, Delhi, Constantinople, Baghdad, Cairo, and Peking This had been put out by the Tashkend Mohammedan Communist Party.TURKEY.Armenian Massacres in Cilicia.  On 2Sth February Lord Curzon sent the following telegram [No. 176] to the British High Commissioner at Constantinople : The information as to Armenian massacres in Cilicia whether the figures be or he not exaggerated. is so serious that the Allied Governments, who are in complete agreement.on the matter, are compelled to take instantaneous action both to secure the punishment of responsible parties and to prevent a repetition of these atrocious crimes.   This action must be taken both in Cilicia and at Constantinople.In Cilicia the French Government, being in military occupation, assume full responsibility for the restoration of order ; and General Gouraud is receiving explicit instructions in this sense.But the Allied Governments cannot acquit the Turkish Government at Constanti-nople of responsibility : and they are compelled at once to show that their authority cannot be derided, and that the provisional decision which has left the Turks in Constantinople does not mean that they are at liberty to practise these abominable deeds.The Supreme Conned is of opinion that some drastic measure should be taken, and that this might assume the form of occupying the War Office or some important Government building, and of securing the persons of the Grand Vizier and the Minister of War or of such Ministers as are primarily responsible, and placing them in confinement either on land or in an Allied man-of-war pending a further investigation of the matter. You shordd consult, your colleagues at once as well as the Naval and Military Commanders-in-Chief, and advise us without delay as to the steps in this, or in any other sense, which you would recommend.The Turkish Government should realize once for all that when such cases as this occur, the old procedure of diplomatic notes and representations will no longer be followed, but that immediate action will be taken by the Allied Governments as in the present case.
Orders&apos;are being,sent simidtaneoasly to the Naval Gommauders-in-Chief to send, one or more-Allied men-of-war to Mersina, if it is your joint opinion that such, a demonstration will assist to save the Armenians from further attack.Telegraphing from Beirut on 29th February [No. 19], Mr. Wratislaw reported that the French authorities calculated that, as there were previous to hostilities 20,000 Armenians in Marash and now only 8,000, the number of the massacred in the town was 12,000, not taking into account what might have happened in the neighbourhood, of which they were ignorant. He added that reports current in Beirut, mainly from Armenian sources, placed the number of victims as high as 30,000, but in his opinion all estimates of numbers were conjectural. There was no doubt that bad massacres had taken place.
