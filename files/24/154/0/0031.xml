FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Internal Affairs. Telegraphing [377] on 17th November the &quot;Viceroy announced the arrival in Kabul of the rest of the Jemal Pasha mission [F.G.R., xxviii, p&apos;. 2]. Great respect and courtesy to the leader of the mission was being extended by the Amir.At Kandahar a form of voluntary military training was reported to have been initiated with some show of success. In the Kandahar province the growth of the anti-Bolshevik feeling is confirmed by all the reports receivech-On 25th November the Viceroy reported [No. 221] the departure of troops from Kabul in the first week of November as follows :-One battalion for Khost, two battalions for Jalalabad, and two battalions of sappers and miners for Mazar-i-Sharif. Recruiting activity was continuing throughout Afghanistan.ARABIA.King Hussein. The British agent at Jeddah reported on 27th November [No. 373] that he had had two very cordial interviews with King Hussein. At the second of them the King had once more recounted his grievances, refusing to listen to anything not in accordance with his own views ; be was. however, subdued and earnest, not showing his usual violent temper, and his genuineness was apparent. He laid particular stress on the imminent danger of an Akhwan invasion, and ended by begging, in tears, that His Majesty s Government should either relieve him of his unbearable responsibility or take some notice of the appeals they had disregarded ; .for two years he had been put off with promises and requests for patience.The agent added that he thought the King s fear in regard to the Akhwan -movement was exaggerated, but he feared that he would use his troops in the event of further frontier incidents.   King Hussein thought that we denied him the right of protecting himself whilst we.allowed Ibn Saud to^attack him.ARMENIA.New Cabinet. On 26th November Colonel Stokes reported [No. 522] that a new Armenian Cabinet, consisting of Dashnabay and his social revolutionaries, had been formed by Vratzia, who was also Minister for Foreign Affairs. Tbe Minister of War was Dro.Peace Negotiations. In the same telegram [No. 522] Colonel Stokes further reported that peace negotiations had begun on 25th November at Alexandropold, whither the Bolshevik representatives were also reported to have gone. It was still uncertain whether Armenia had accepted Bolshevik mediation. The Armenian Government bad protested against the despatch of troops to Shagali on the railway between Karaklis and Sanin.Attitude of the League of Nations. The following telegram from the President of the Council of the League of Nations, transmitting a message from the Council of the League to Governments being members of the League, was received by the Prime Minister on 26th November : -- The Assembly of the League of Nations adopted on the 22nd instant the following resolution :- The Assembly, anxious to co-operate with the Council in order to put an end in the shortest time possible to the horrors of the Armenian -tragedy, requests tbe Council to arrive at an understanding with the Governments with a view to entrusting a Power with the task of taking the necessary measures to stop the hostilities between Armenia and the Kemalists. The Council considered this resolution and decided to communicate it to the Governments of all the states members of the League, and also to the United States, the President of which has-
-already undertaken the task of fixing the frontiers of Armenia., The Council begs your Government to state whether it will be disposed, either alone or conjointly with others, to undertake on behalf of the League of Nations this great humanitarian mission, a mission which, moreover, entails no obligation of a permanent nature. The Council would be grateful to receive your reply, if in the affirmative, as soon as possible, so that it may be communicated to the Assembly before, the end of the present session.AUSTRIA.President Sehober&apos;s Attempt to form a Cabinet. On 20th November Mr. Lindley telegraphed as follows [No. 413]:  The causes of President SchobeFs failure to form a Cabinet were : (1) The objections of the Pan-Germans to Mr. Redlich as Finance Minister on the ground that his grandfather was a Jew and that he had been in the Lammarsch Government which signed the armistice and had thus broken the German alliance. Mr. Redlich is probably the most eminent living Austrian and Mr. Schober would not do without him. The Pan-German objections accurately reflect the patriotic and political intelligence of the party.(2) The discovery by two other important candidates that the Christian Socialists intended that they should only hold office for a few months and then give way to party government.   They worrld not leave their business on these terms.This afternoon a Government was formed and will presumably be elected by the National Council this evening. Dr. Mayr, at present acting as Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, occupies the same position in the new Government. His colleagues are partly members of the Christian Socialist party and partly second-rate officials.The first sitting of the new Chamber was marked by almost as much disorder as characterized the other Reichsrath : the opposing parties insulted each other. It is -clearly impossible for either to rule the country. The Social Democrats have taken up the question of bread, and are rousing all their followers against the Christian Socialists on this account. The strikes show no signs of ending, and the country is getting nervous.In these circumstances I do not think the new Government will last more than a month at the most. Before the end of that period I expect that Mr. Schober will be asked to form a Government on any terms.BALTIC STATES.Armistice between Lithuania and General Zeligowski. Mr. Wilton reported from Kovno on 29th December [No. 188] that an armistice between Lithuania and General Zeligowski had been arranged by the commission of control to take effect from midnight, 30th November. The main points of the agreement were the cessation of hostilities, a neutral zone, and the exchange of prisoners.BELGIUM. &apos;.   -New Cabinet. On 20th November Sir George Grahame reported [No. 117] that the -composition of the new Cabinet was as follows : M. Carton de Wiart, Prime Minister and Minister of Interior. *M. Jasper, Minister of Foreign Affairs.M. Theunis, Finance.M. Deveze, National Defence.M. Van De Vvere, Economic Affairs.M. Neujean, Railways. i5M. Vandervelde. Justice. &quot;*M. Ruzette, Agriculture.*M. AVauters, Industay and Labour. *M. Destree, Science and Arts. &quot;:;;M. Anseele, Public Works. &quot;*M. Franck, Colonies.* Members of the former Cabinet.
THE CAUCASUS.Recognition of Georgia by Germany.  Colonel Stokes telegraphed [No. 504] from... Tiflis on 16th November reporting the receipt of a note from the Georgian Government, stating that on the 5th November the German representative at Tiflis had informed them in an official communication that the German Republic had accorded the Georgian Republic.rfe jure recognition on 24th September 1920.Commercial Treaty between Georgia, Azerbaijan, and the Soviet Government.  The  following  telegram  [No.   505]  from  Colonel Stokes was received on 20th November :- On   14th  November  the  Georgian  on  one  side   and   the   Soviet. Government   and   Azerbaijan   on   the   other,  signed  a  commercial  agreement providing: (1) Mutual free transit; (2) Georgia to send to Baku coal and railway and building materials, and to allow export of merchandise, &amp;c, excepting cereals-and sugar; (3) Georgia to receive 12,500 tons of oil products within a month of the arrival at Baku of the first train-load of goods, and 16,500 tons monthly subsequently ;.. (4) tbe oil products received by Georgia are not to be exported.FRANCE.Attitude towards Greece. On 24th November Mr. Lindsay telegraphed from Paris [No. 1353] the following statement- made by the President of the Council at the end of the sitting in the Chamber of Deputies on the previous day : The events which have so rapidly followed each other in Greece, namely, the death of King Alexander, the defeat of M. Venizelos and his party, the access to-power of politicians hostile to the Entente and their intention to replace King Constantine on the throne of Greece, have created a new situation in the face oF which the French Government reserve their liberty of action.France does not wish to intervene in the internal affairs of Greece, but if on the-morrow of the war a Power recalls to the throne a sovereign who is the accomplice of our enemies, that Power must be warned that she will no longer find among the Allies the same feelings or co-operation.Moreover, treaties make it a duty for the protecting Powers to give Greece a reasoned warning about the gravity of an act which might produce the result of permitting Germany to intervene directly or indirectly in the East whence she caused, the war to arise.The Treaty, of Sevres, which is not yet ratified (loud applause), deals with the special rights of surveillance and control which were recognized by the treaties of&quot; 1832, 1863, and 1864 as belonging , to the protecting Powers. The French Government realize the importance of concerting their action and policy with the action and policy of our British ally. They wish to study and solve in complete accord with their ally the problems which arise. Pourparlers are actively proceeding between London and Paris. Definite measures will be decided on shortly at the interview which I am going to have with the head of the British Government.The statement, Mr. Lindsay added, was loudly applauded by the whole house, and at the request of the President of the &quot;Council, further debate was postponed till 3rd December.GERMANY.Upper Silesia. On 17th November Lord d&apos;Abernon sent the following telegram-[No. 588] :-The Reichsrath yesterday unanimously adopted a law regarding the autonomy of&quot; Upper Silesia. The law decrees that two months after the plebiscite, if the majority of the population have declared in favour of Germany, a new plebiscite will take place to determine whether Upper Silesia shall be created an autonomous federal state or not. Should the majority of the population of Upper Silesia declare for the creation of an autonomous federal state, immediate satisfaction will be given to this wish without any fresh legislation on the part of the Empire. In a note accom-accompanying  the law the German Government insists upon the point that the autonomy promised to Upper Silesia constitutes an exceptional case and does not justify in any way the demand for similar autonomy on the part of other portions of the Empire. In commenting on this law the German Press accentuates the fact that the advantages..
now offered to the Upper Silesians are far greater than those granted under the Polish law. They believe that propagandists like Korfanty wiR find it difficult to discover any defect in the German proposal.Emergency Capital Tax. On 18th November Lord d&apos;Abernon reported [No. 589] that the Government had submitted to the Reichsrath a draft law ordering the immediate payment of the first third of the emergency capital tax, together with the immediate payment of. the whole of the sums due under the special tax on war fortunes. The final payment of the latter tax would have to be made within three months of the final establishment of the list of taxpayers.GREECE.Neio Cabinet. On 18th November Lord Granville telegraphed [No.. 289] that a Government had been formed under the presidency of M. Rhally, as follows : M. Rhally, President of Council, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Justice adinterim. M. Tsaldaris, Interior.M. Zaimis, Religion and Public Instruction.M. Calogeropoulos, Finance and Ravitaillement ad interim.M. Mavremichaelis, National Econonxy and Agriculture ad interim.M. Etsaldaris, Communications ad interim.M. Gounaris, War.M. J. Rhally, Navy.Lord Granville added that the Chamber would meet on 25th November.Declaration of King Constantine. On 24th November Mr. Russell reported [No. 127] from Berne that he had that afternoon received a visit from M. Streit, who said that his purpose in calling was to communicate the declaration of King Constantine which would be made semi-officially in Paris that day to the French Government by Prince George of Greece, and that the substance of the declaration -which M. Streit read was as follows : The King&apos;s point of view is identical with that of the Government in Athens. Both King and Government desire that Greece should continue the same foreign policy as before and should collaborate strictly and loyally with the two Powers (Great Britain and France). The King is persuaded that not only the actual Greek Government will, but that also any Greek Government in any circum-stances would, follow this path; nevertheless, the more consideration the Powers give the will (group undec3qpherable) Greek people have already manifested and will again manifest at the plebiscite, the greater will be the content with which the Greek people will follow the path in question. The Greek people are aware that they have assumed a heavy task, but with a view to securing- the pacification of the Orient, Greece believes it is possible for her to assume the heaviest tasks in the mutual interests of herseR and the Powers. On this basis, the King thinks a useful discussion might be started both on the question of detail and of general scope, and that after such discussion an understanding with the Greek Government would follow without difficulty.Mr. Russell went on to say that in promising to transmit the above message he had explained to M. Streit that whatever the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government might be towards King Constantine in the future, it would, in his opinion, take some time for the British people to forget his pro-German sentiments during the war, the broken treaty with Serbia, and the surrender of Greek regiments to the Germans. M. Streit, after attempting- to exonerate the King, said that the present bad impression prevailing in England and France could be easily obliterated by judicious propaganda.ITALY.Military Convention with Serbia. On 19th November [No. 508] Sir George Buchanan reported that no mention had appeared in the Italian Press of a military convention which was concluded at Rapallo as a precaution against Austria and Hungary in the event of a Hapsburg returning to the throne. The convention did not appear to be generally known, but his authority for its existence was a good one,23-1 B
----        -PERSIA.The New Cabinet [F.G.R., xxx, p. 8]. On 15th November Mr. Norman telegraphed?, adding the name of Nasr Ul Mulk as Minister without portfolio.POLAND.Relations with the Soviet Government. Sir Percy Loraine reported on 26th. November that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had sent to M. &quot;Chicherin and M. Rakowski (Ukrainan Soviet) a note to the following effect: Since the renewal of negotiations at Riga, the policy of the Soviet delegation has been such as to render negotiations extremely difficult. Its continual protests suggest that the real Soviet object is to spin out negotiations or exploit them for propaganda purposes. Protests have produced an atmosphere of uncertainty about the negotiations which may unfavourably affect their issue.The Polish Government categorically rejects the reproaches of failure to fulfil the armistice terms and demurs to the pretension that the protests of the Soviet delegation should be taken into account in the negotiations themselves.The Polish Government cannot admit that negotiations which it began with a sincere desire to end the war should be employed for other purposes.In contrast with Russia, Poland has demobilized seven classes, thus reducing- its armed forces in the belief that they will not be needed to support the execution of the Riga peace preliminaries.The present Soviet tactics permit of a suspicion regarding the Soviet Governments determination to end the state of war.To remove these doubts, and with a view to ensure a satisfactory continuation of&apos; the negotiations, the Polish Government suggests :  (1) That the two delegations should forthwith fix a date for the signature of a final peace treaty.(2) After the troops have occupied the lines laid down in the armistice, the immediate establishment of military guarantees to maintain a durable peace..The Polish Government expresses profound astonishment at the attitude of the Soviet delegation regarding the release of hostages and the exchange of prisoners, which is contrary to tbe accepted principles of humanity. It protests especially against the retention of members of the mission of M. Filipowicz (i.e,, to the Caucasus).The Polish Government hopes for an early reply to the foregoing, and is meanwhile prepared at any moment to send the necessary instructions to its delegation.RUSSIA.The Release of Prisoners. The following-message was despatched by M. Chicherin on 24th November : There is a party of 65 British citizens now at the Finnish frontier at Bieloostrov to be received by your representatives. Some other Britishers who were not able to-join this echelon are brought to Riga with our couriers. These include Emmanuel Kennen, arrested for speculation, whose repatriation was asked in a communication made by the British consul at Reval on 4th November ; also Letitia Bowler and Stan Harding mentioned in your telegram. Stan Harding came to Russia after conclusion of the agreement to release certain grave offenders arrested up to that time. According to conclusive evidence reaching us at the time of her arrival, and according- to her own confession, she is a British secret service agent, and obviotisly not entitled to release, either on the basis of the Copenhagen agreement or the proposals of 30th June, which surely do not constitute a carte blanche permit for British secret service agents in future to carry on their nefarious work in Russia. However, the Soviet Government, desiring not to let the question of &quot; repatriation of British citizens stand in the way of an understanding with Great Britain, consented to her release. The regrettable delay in bringine the British citizens to the Finnish frontier was caused, partly by the simultaneous arrival at that frontier of thousands of war prisoners from Germany and from Siberia whereby the evacuation machinery was unduly overburdened, partly it is due
to the incorrect and. insufficient information furnished, by the British Government regarding British citizens in Russia. The persons whose addresses were given by the British Government could not be found at those addresses ; others, as Chamot and Tidmarch, are not British citizens. In many instances the British Government demands the repatriation of divorcees and widows of Russian citizens who, while born English, in Russian law are Russian &quot;citizens. Even the children of Russian citizens having British born mothers have been asked to be repatriated. Nevertheless, the Soviet Government is not making an issue of technicalities of such a character, and wherever bond fide British nationality is reasonably established permits to leave the country are granted, however, without prejudicing the right of Russia in future to be guided by Russian law in a matter of this character. The incorrectness of the British information is also manifested by the demands made for the repatriation of Britishers such as KeUecher, Farr, Priestlet, Conlin, who were repatriated during August and September. Lord Curzon states in a telegram of 20th November that, anxious as he is to complete the general exchange, including the return of Russians recently asked by Krassin, this cannot be done until the remainder of the British subjects have reached the Finnish frontier. In view of the above-mentioned incompleteness of the British information regarding what constitutes this &quot; remainder,&quot; we hold this attitude of the British Government highly unfair and altogether in variance with the spirit of confidence displayed by the Soviet Government. Information has reached us that the Russian sailors Peter Michaelov, Vassily Roscikin and Abas Alaskerov, arrested by the British in Persia in 1918, and kept in abominable prisons in India, are not yet released, as well as other Russians arrested by the British in Asia. We expect a speedy return of these and other Russians still detained by Britain against their will. On our side we are making diligent searches for such British citizens who have not yet been located, and for the speedy repatriation of those found.Batum. On 24th November the following message [No. 308] was sent to Mr. Leslie at Reval for transmission to M. Chicherin : Repeated enquiries and protests by the Soviet authorities, though destitute of the smallest foundation, as to the alleged intention of theTiritish or the allied Governments to occupy Batum, suggest that that place, which is a part of the territory of the independent state of Georgia, is in some danger. His Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad to receive a corresponding assurance from the Soviet Government that, in so far as that Government is concerned, there is no foundation for such suspicions and that they have no intention of occupying Batum themselves.Two days later M. Chicherin telegraphed as follows :   .The Russian Soviet Governments protests against the eventuality of a British occupation of Batum, as suggested by the wireless messages of British stations, have led the British Government to the assumption that this place -which is a part of independent Georgia is in some danger. The British radio telegrams prove that it is really threatened by the danger of being occupied by Entente forces. As for the intimation made by the British Government that the safety of Batum, and in general the independence of Georgia, is allegedly threatened by a danger from the Russian Government, this allegation is dictated by the same misinformation of she British Government as to Caucasian affairs which was shown by the British Prime Minister during his conference with the Russian trade delegation on 7th June, when he expressed surprise at learning that a treaty had been concluded between Soviet Russia and Georgia on 7th May. Otherwise the British Government would have known that the Russian Soviet Government was the first to recognize, de jure, the independent Georgian Government; this recognition being still withheld by the Entente Governments, which try to demonstrate such interest in the fate of Georgia. As a matter of fact the whole policy of Soviet Russia in the Near East is dictated by her desire to preserve peace and. to render possible to every people to determine its own fate. There has been on the part of the Russian Government no act which would even remotely infringe the independence of Georgia. It has recognized its inde-pendence in the same treaty which stipulates that no alien forces shall reside at Batum, and it is loyally observing this treaty, by which its action in the questions concerned is determined. A hostile occupation of Batum would mean the violation of the above treaty, and from the point of view, not only of its own safety, but also of the defence of this treaty against any violation, the Russian Government would not be able to remain indifferent to such eventuality. In every case, however, the Russian Government wiR always faithfully adhere to the recognition of Georgia&apos;s independence, and will in no case violate its sovereign rights either by the occupation of Batum or otherwise. 23-1 C
Siberian Affairs. Sir Charles Eliot, telegraphing from Tokio on 20th November [No. 442], transmitted the following message from the military attache :-(1) The Trans-Baikal general staff informs me that General SeminofFs army has been severely defeated by the partisans (sic) near Dauria and has retreated in confusion to Natsievskaya, just north of Manchuria. Many of his troops have crossed the frontier into Manchuria, where the)&apos;, have been disarmed by the Chinese, The strength of the partisans in this district is increasing daily, and -is reported to exceed 25,000. General Seminoff himself is still at Dauria, but the Japanese consider that he will have to flee for his life in the course of the next few days,(2) Baron Ungern is reported sick at Aksha. His troops are operating in the Sebenga valley.Although General Seminoff disclaims responsibility for Baron Ungern&apos;s action, it is suspected that the two have been working in collusion.(3) &quot;Vladivostock. General Oi stated definitely on 12th November to members of the popular assembly and the representatives of the various political groups that the Japanese would on no account allow communist rule in the territory occupied by Japanese troops.(4) Nikolsk. The Nikolsk-Imam portion of Ussuri railway was handed over to the Russians by the Japanese on 30th October.(5) Chita. Conferences for the unification of far eastern Siberia (Trans-Baikal, Amur and Maritime provinces) were held on 28th and 30th October, and a working Cabinet of six members was appointed, with Krasnostshokow as chairman.The Cabinet issued a declaration on 1st November declaring that it assumed aU authority, civil and military, from Lake Baikal to the Pacific. The Vladivostock Government, whose delegations had not arrived when the conference was held, has refused to recognize the above declaration until an agreement has been reached with its delegates and passed by the Vlachvostock popular assembly&apos;-.The Cabinet has appointed General Eyche, former commander-in-chief of v^erknieudinsk, to the post of commander-in-chief of the far-eastern troops.SPAIN.The Postal Conference. (1) Financial Contributions. Sir Esme Howard tele-graphed [No. 380] from Madrid as follows on 21st November : The Australian delegate to the postal conference has received instructions to support a proposal, to be brought forward by the Swiss delegate in compliance with the suggestions made by the Brussels financial conference, according to which the basis of contribution towards the expenses of the Postal Union would be modified, -(? the) classes being fixed for the future on the basis of the population and revenue of the various countries.This change is desired because under the covenant of the League of Nations, members contribute!? to) the expenses in the ratio of their contributions to the Postal Union. But the British postal delegates draw my attention to the very unsatisfactory character of this classification, for the expenses of the Postal Union are very small and members have hitherto been placed in various classes at their discretion (e.g., Ethiopia is in the first class), their classification being changed at their request without question. (? We) see in the Press that the committee of the Assembly of the League of Nations has decided that the scale of contribution to the League will vary with any changes in the classification of members of the Postal Union, and it seems probable that the result will be that the members of the Union will demand that their classification&apos; shall be changed, not on postal grounds, but in order to escape part of the heavier charges of the League of Nations budgets. It would be practically impossible for a postal congress to object to a change desired by any country for reasons that had nothing to do with postal matters.General Williamson has received no instructions with regard to this question, but he desires me to point out that in view of the fact that the congress is closing in .a few days, and that most of the delegates have received no instructions on this point,. it would &quot;be better, should His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to press this suggestion, to adopt the proposal that will be brought forward by the International Bureau of the Union when the matter is raised, namely, that it should be discussed between the secretariat of the League of Nations and the International Bureau of the Union, and that any agreement which they may reach should be submitted by circular to the members of the Union for approval or expressions of opinion in accordance with the usual procedure under the postal convention.
(2) Position of Dominions and Colonies. On 23rd November Sir Esme Howard reported [No. 384] &quot;that at a plenary meeting of tbe postal congress that day the United States delegation backed, he understood, by all the South American delegations, had proposed that in future no dominions or colonies should exercise voting power in the Postal Union.   The proposal was defeated by 44 to 22,(3) Signature. Telegraphing [No. 390] on 30th November, Sir Esme reported that the postal convention had been signed that morning.TIBET.Relations with India. Telegraphing from Peking [No. 489] on 18th November, Mr. Olive reported that he had informed the Minister for Eoreign Affairs verbally that the Tibetan Government had for months past pressed the Government of India to send someone to Lassa. They had been greatly disappointed at the failure of last vear&apos;s negotiations and the Government of India had considered it advisable to send Mr. Bell to explain the whole position.The Minister for Foreign Affairs had made but little comment. He presumed that Mr. Bell was not going to negotiate some new arrangement and that his stay in Lassa would be only temporary ; in reply to which he had said that he had no knowledge that Mr. Bell was going to enter into any new negotiations.TURKEY.An Identic Note to the Porte. On 24th November Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 1246] the following translation of an identic note which was being- addressed to the Porte : The High Commissioners have the honour to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that they have received from their Governments instructions as to tbe reply to be made to his note of 4th November.These instructions are to reiterate their former demand for the ratification of the treaty by the Turkish Government. The accomplishment of this formality by the Turkish Government is the more urgent as it would imply on their part an indispensable disavowal of the aggression against Armenia, which constitutes a violation in anticipation of the treaty, and a marked act of hostility against the Allies, which has produced a great and deplorable impression on the public opinion of the world, and is liable to induce the most serious consequences for Turkey.Ratification is equaRy necessary in the interests of the Turkish Government itself for the reason already mentioned, that although the allied Governments in their- desire to furnish Turkey as soon as possible with the means of improving her financial and economic situation, have agreed to allow the financial commission contemplated in the treaty, which is alone competent to elaborate and apply these means, of beginning work after the ratification by the Turkish Government, they can go no further, but maintain the principle that no financial assistance can be given except by the financial commission, whose assumption of activities is inevitably contingent upon the ratification of the treaty by the Turkish Government,The High Commissioners therefore request the Turkish Government to ratify without delay, and expect that this ratification will, in any case, take place before the expiration of the period mentioned in the note under reply. They would wish to n-eceive a definite assurance in this connexion.
