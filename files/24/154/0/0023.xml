FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.The Herat Border [F.C.R., xxii, p. 2].-The Viceroy of India reported [No. 204] on 29th July that raids hy Afghans - from Russian territory continued, and that the Jamsbidis in Badghis were attempting to destroy the crops belonging to members of their tribe who had been deported.   &quot;Interned Affairs. Telegraphing [No. 205] on 5th August, the Viceroy7 said that reports, which required confirmation, bad been received of large troop movements to Turkestan as a precaution against Bolshevik activities. All was quiet in Kandahar, where the general belief prevailed that peace with the British had been definitely concluded.ARABIA. ..King Hussein and Syria [F.C.R., xxii, p. 3].-On 30th July Lord Allenby reported [No. 779] the receipt of further protests from Hussein against the Frenchi advance and the occupation, which had been written before the news of FeisaTs discomfiture had been received.. The King requested a declaration of the British Governments attitude, because, being bound by his nationality and by his own and his son&apos;s promises, he would not let slip any opportunity of &quot; disturbing the comfort of the aggressors.&quot; :King Hussein and Ibn Saud [F.C.R., xxii, p. 2.]: -Telegraphing [No. 816] on 9th August from Alexandria, Mr. Scott reported that King Hussein had refused to give any guarantees as to meeting Ibn Saud or keeping the peace. The King declared that the 30,000L was &quot;only a part of the subsidy already overdue,&quot; and that to give the required undertakings in return for it would be beneath his dignity. He threatened once more to abdicate rather than accept the conditions.AUSTRIA.Payment of Private Debts. Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 347] from Vienna on 7th August that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that day that the Austrian Minister of Finance had concluded an arrangement at Paris for the payment of private debts by instalments.The Austrian Government had now heard that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not intend to conclude any arrangement, but would leave British creditors to collect their own debts.This would entail the ruin of certain Vienna banks if creditors pursued&apos; their claims. Moreover, the arrangement with France could hardly7 be carried out unless an arrangement of some kind were concluded with His Majesty&apos;s Government. In these circumstances the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked him to recommend to Lord Curzon the conclusion of an arrangement. Mr. Lindley suggested that Sir E. Harvey, now in London or Paris, be consulted.BALTIC STATES.Lithuania and the Bolsheviks. Mr. Ward reported [No. 110] from Kovno on 7th August that terms had been come to between the Lithuanians and the Bolsheviks regarding the evacuation of Lithuania, which the Government considered satisfactory. The evacuation would be effected in three stages, leaving the Molodechna-Lida-Groclno line for the final retirement of the Bolsheviks. A mixed commission is to supervise the evacuation, and the Bolsheviks are to take only7 their own property. They have &quot;undertaken, in writing to cease all Bolshevik propaganda.   Lithuania will
regain.all rolling stock on -the Swfenziatiy-Postare railway, and the Government can mow take over all civil administration, and those institutes with which the military have no concern.Dantzhj Frontiers.-Telegraphing [No. 32] from Dantzig pn 8th August Sir Reginald Tower-reported the following : .The President of the Provisional ^Council submits a scheme for the. drastic rectification of the Dantzig frontiers in view of the likelihood of the invasion of Poland and West (sic) Prussia by Bolsheviks. It is -suggested that the extension of Dantzig territory would make it self-supportino-, and -obviate many difficulties attaching to the Polish corridor.The suggestion which I am asked to forward is as follows : The Western boundary line from the Baltic through Lauenburg, Konitz, Schneidemuehl to the river Netze, thence eastward following that river to the intersectionof the Brombero--Hohenzalza railway^ continuing east-ward to the south of Thorshavn to strike the river Drewenz, thence north-eastward following the river to Gilgenburo-, thence following the boundary of the plebiscite areas.to the sea.The. President of the . Council states explicitly that he has not been in communication with Germany on this subject, and puts it, forward only in the interests of a durable peace.BOLIVIA.Provisional Government [F.C.R, xxii, p. 4]. Mr. 0&apos;Reilly telegraphed [No. 48] from La Paz on 29th July, that the Provisional Government were all assembled there, and had collectively confirmed their assurances. Salamanca, the republican leader, had now adhered.   Depjorted liberals would be allowed to return before the elections.It was agreed by the Corps Diplomatique and the manager of the Bolivian railway, that this Government might prove to be the best that there had been for some time, but the situation was greatly complicated by the shortage of funds, the previous Government having left the exchequer empty. Mr. 0&apos;Reilly was of opinion that Bolivian, finances, if carefully managed, should prove sound, and although the present moment was critical, the revenue would improve as the country was opened up, and many economies were possible.On 2nd August Mr. 0&apos;Reilly sent the following telegram [No. 51] : The Provisional Government are very nervous about the attitude of the army and are continuing deportations contrary to the advice of Salamanca. This is unfortunate as he is trusted universally and his continued support is the best guarantee of stability. My United States colleague and I are venturing to suggest to the Provisional Government that this may probably be the view taken by our &apos; Governments in connexion with recognition.The Provisional Government are most anxious for recognition and we hope that they will take the hint. At the same time we feel that it will be better to take seme risk to accord it prematurely, rather than endanger their position by withholding it too long. Another revolution now would be less peaceful and might lead to a series of military revolutions. It appears, therefore, desirable to stabilize the present civil Government if possible and to get the army out of the revolutionary habit.In reply to Mr. 0&apos;Reilly&apos;s telegram, Lord Curzon sent.[No.&quot; 25] the following instructions on 10th August : You may give recognition as a cle facto provisional Government, in the expectation that, the administration will shortly be placed on a proper basis through the holding of free elections.You should choose your own- time for making a communication in the above sense,,which may be withheld for a time if you think fit.Relations with Chile [F.C.R., xxii, p. 5].-Mr. 0&apos;Reilly on 2nd August telegraphed [[No. 52] as follows :-In spite of mutual assurances of. friendly intentions&apos; exchanged here, the Provisional Government are still much alarmed by military events&apos; in Chile,.and have appealed at length.The situation of. the port question appears to be &quot;that, apart from internal reasons for mobilization, Chile is anxious for financial settlement, and is ready to let Bolivia have Arica for a consideration:. The. Provisional Government.,have been forced to recognize the impracticability of  the demand for Antofagasta,  but are not. yet
identified with any demand for Arica, and are still on good terms with. Pern.   The-latter is presumably equally concerned at the Chilean mobilization, and may be in an accommodating frame of mind.The moment therefore seems to be propitious for a suggestion from any quarter-&apos; for.arbitration, by, e.g., Brazil or Spain, with the possible assistance of Great Britain and the United States, in order-to ensure compliance with the verdict.- Mr. 0&apos;Reilly has been informed by telegram [No. 24] of 9th August, that His. Maj esty &apos;s Government are not desirous of being brought into this question.BULGARIA.Reports of Intended Advance by Greek Troops. On 4th August Sir Herbert. Bering reported [No. 89] from Sofia that the Bulgarian Prime Minister had addressed a note to the foreign representative stating that the frontier authorities reported that officers of the Greek troops were declaring that they were awaiting orders to occupy certain points in Bulgarian territory and to cross the frontier to look for Turkish arms. In bringing this to the notice of the Greek Powers, and to avoid all misunderstanding, the Bulgarian Government declared that such violation of Bulgarian territory could not be tolerated, and that the frontier guard had orders to oppose by force any attempt of Greek units to cross the actual frontier line of Thrace. -Commenting on the above, Sir Herbert said that, although he was not disposed to place great belief in these reports, he thought that any such action by Greek troops, would be unjustifiable. The Peace Treaty having been ratified, the Bulgarians had evinced a genuine desire to live in peace, notwithstanding Greek suspicions to the-contrary. All arms had been removed from the 3,500 Turkish troops who had crossed the frontier, and had been stored away from the frontier. The Inter-Allied Commission had reported that the relations between the Greek and Bulgarian troops on the frontier were most friendly.THE CAUCASUS.Treatment of British Prisoners [F.R.C., xxii, p. 51.-On 29th July Lord Curzom sent [No. 218] the following message to the British Consul at Reval for transmission to M Chicherin in reply to his last.telegram on this subject :-Babushkin and his associates were released from prison on receipt of the news that the death-sentence on Vice-Consul Hewelcke, at Baku, had been suspended.   They are now at liberty, but under supervision.   As I have telegraphed to M. Litvinoff, I will arrange for their repatriation and that of all other Russians in British Empire who wish to return to Russia, as soon as I learn that you are prepared to release, without any exception, wdratsoever, all British subjects who wish to leave Russia.   In these I include the British prisoners in Baku, for whose fate it is impossible not to hold Soviet Govern-ment responsible.   This view is confirmed by the terms of your telegram which, threatened reprisals on our prisoners by the Azerbaijan Republic.   I am convinced that a word from the Moscow Government is all that is required to set these persons free, and I must-urgently request that this be done without further delay.   Public opinion in this country will not tolerate further procrastination.The following telegram from M. Chicherin, presumably&apos; in reply to Lord Ourzon&apos;s message, above, was received on 2nd August : With regard to the British prisoners at Baku, we must once more emphatically reject the assumption that any undertakings entered into by us have retroactive force-upon the entire sovereign Soviet Republics, and that, if the contingency arises that any Government of such Republics may have taken actions in contravention of the terms of agreements concluded by us with foreign Governments, we are under an obligation to force their hands in order to achieve the reparation of claims which may be thus raised. The course of entering into direct negotiations with the Azerbaijan Government remains open to Great Britain. This course seems the more natural since the British Government have recognized the independence of the Azerbaijan-Republic by recognizing its former Government, and by accrediting to it a Military Mission whose avowed object was the support of the Russian counter-revolutionary forces under Denikin.
We have been already advised by the Azerbaijan Government that thej^ wordd be willing to authorize M. Litvinoff to negotiate the question of the Baku prisoners should they be directly approached by Great Britain. As regards the general exchange- of prisoners, being likewise anxious to bring it to a conclusive solution, we would like to know when we can expect that Babushkin and the other Russian prisoners in British hands will reach-Russia. Regarding the British prisoners in the Ukraine, the Ukrainian Government is alone competent.The following instruction was telegraphed [No. 269] to Major Collas, at Tiflis, on 6th August: If you now have means of communicating direct with the Azer-baijan Government you should address to them a formal demand on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the release of the Baku prisoners, whose continued detention is absolutely unjustified and is rousing extreme indignation in this country.From Constantinople Admiral de Robeck telegraphed [No. 892] on 5th August as follows : My Italian colleague has communicated to me a copy of a telegram received from the Italian representative at Tiflis, stating that Commandant Imsom, of the Italian Mission at Baku, has received definite instructions to endeavour- to obtain the release of British and French prisoners, or, failing that, an amelioration of their lot.[See under &quot;Russia,&quot; p. 10.]CHILE.Relations with Bolivia [F.C.R., xxii, p. 6]. Mr. vaughan reported [No. 132] on 29th July that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated in the Chamber that Chile&apos;s mobilization was purely pacific and defensive, and was also unconnected with the internal situation.Following the above, Mr. Vaughan reported [No. 131] on 31st July that the Chilean Government appeared to have mobilized the 1st Division in a moment of alarm. Public opinion was clamouring for a final settlement of the, dispute with Feru, but the Governments intention had not yet been declared.[See under &quot; Bolivia,&quot; p. 3.]Relations with Peru. Mr. Vaughan telegraphed [No. 138] from Santiago on 4th August that while the opinion expressed in influential circles is that Chile will not take the initiative in any way, the idea prevails in military circles that after the Presidents proclamation on 30th August, when the army is ready and the. internal situation permits, she will ask Peru as to her intentions as to respecting the Treaty of Ancon or not.It has always been the desire of Chile that the stipulated plebiscite should be held in the two provinces jointly. In 1912 it was suggested that the plebiscite should be held within 20 years, and that under the supervision of two Peruvians, two Chileans, and the President of the Chilean Supreme Court, the vote should be exercised by-all persons born in the provinces and by Chileans and Peruvians of more than three years&apos; residence.Chile would probably urge an immediate plebiscite instead of waiting 20 years,, and in the probable event of its being favourable to her, Avould be prepared to pay an increased indemnity to Peru, and to conclude a commercial treaty with her. A satisfactory settlement with Peru would doubtless result in coming to terms with Bolivia.The Chilean Government declare that they have no intention of going to war, and the general opinion is that Peru is fostering a w&apos;ar-scare with the object of inducing the intervention of the League of Nations.CHINA.Chinese Eastern Railway [F.C.R., xix, p. 8]. Sir Auckland geddes telegraphed [No. 553] on 27th Jidy from Washington the following report : An informal meeting was held at the State Department on 26th July, at which were present Mr. Colby, the Secretary of State, the United States Ambassador at Tokio, the Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. B. Alston, and myself, when the question of the Chinese Eastern Railvvav was discussed.19-2 B
COSTA   RICA.Resumption of Official Relations. The following instructions were sent [No. 49] from the Foreign Office on 29th July to Mr. Graham, Consul at Colon, Panama :   Please inform the Costa Rica Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government will now have much pleasure in . resuming the official relations between the two countries which have unfortunately been recently interrupted, and ask for the agrement of Mr. Bennett as His Majesty s Minister. Credentials for yourself as Charge d&apos;Affaires during Mr. Bennett&apos;s absence will be sent.Sir A. Geddes telegraphed [No. 581] from Washington, on 6th August, that the Costa Rica Government had been recognized by the United States Government.GERMANY.Russia, Poland and Germany [F.C.R., xxii, p. 6].-Telegraphing [No. 460] on 3rd August, Lord Kilmarnock reported that the Polish Minister was firmly of the opinion that unless the Allies definitely invited, her assistance, on which she would put forward her conditions, Germany would put every obstacle in their way. She was well aware of the difficulty of supplying Poland with arms other than those surrendered by herself, of which large quantities were awaiting destruction on the frontier. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had declared that the Germans must be treated as equals in any future negotiations, and that so long as Germany was treated as an outcast she would do nothing.The Polish Minister believed that the conditions which Germany7 would put forward were (1) the return of the Polish corridor; (2) no plebiscite in Upper Silesia ; and (3) concessions in economic and coal questions.Measures for Frontier Defence. Sir George Grahame reported [No. 936] from Paris on 6th August that the German delegation had sent a note (No. 322) to the President of the Peace Conference, dated 5th August,-the substance of which was as follows :-It referred to the request for the formation of a voluntary force for the defence of East Prussia made in its note of 21st July, and stated that though the frontier had not been violated by Bolshevik troops, fighting was proceeding close to it, and Bolshevik propaganda was spreading ; that the population were seriously alarmed, and were spontaneously forming a local militia for- their own defence. This move-ment could not be prevented, and in order to avoid its becoming irregular, the German Government were organizing it in those places&apos;where the temper of the population rendered it necessary. The object was purely defence and the maintenance of order, and the German Government hoped that the Allies would approve their action.It referred to the German delegation s note of 30th July requesting that the Inter-Allied plebiscite commission in Allenstein should, in Concert with the German commission, call Reichswehr troops into the plebiscite area.   No reply had been1, It was unanimously felt that it was essential that the railway should remain tinder international control until it can resume its original status under a recon-stittited Russia. The control to be vested in the Powers previously represented oh the technical commission, viz., the United States, Great Britain, France,. Russia, Italy, and China.2. In accordance with the agreement of 11th March 1918, the guarding of the line.should be undertaken by Chinese troops.3. That Chinese troops should guard the line up to the terminal of Vladivbstock. 4. The question of financing the railway by consols was considered, and great, difficulties were recognized (a) on account bf the guarantee, (b) on account of the Russd-Chinese agreement whereby China is entitled to take over the line in the event of default-It was suggested that a sufficient portion of Russian gold recovered from the Germans should, be devoted to the purpose.    It was agreed that Mr. B. Alston should discuss the matter with Your Lordship on arrival in  London nest Week, and that pending (? group missing) by His Majesty&apos;s Government, no communication should be made to the Japanese Ambassador here.
received, and no troops had so far been sent in.   But as it was impossible in the present circumstances to leave the area without military protection, the German Government would be obliged to send troops into those parts of the territory where their presence might be required, owing to the departure of the Allied troops.HUNGARY.Exchange of Prisoners with Russia. Mr. Grant Watson telegraphed [No. 655] from Copenhagen on 31st J uly that M. Litvinoff had issued a communique to the effect that the agreement concluded in Copenhagen between Doctor Michael Jaungerth, Hungarian representative, and himself as representative of Russia, and the Ukraine Republic, for the mutual exchange of prisoners, had been ratified by the Governments concerned. Under the terms of the agreement Hungary binds herself not to furnish direct or indirect military assistance to the ememies of Soviet Russia and Ukraine.ITALY.Italy and Greece. Sir George Buchanan telegraphed [unnumbered] from Rome on 7th August that he had asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what was the real difficulty in the way of an agreement with the Greek Government. The latter had replied that the Italian Government could never consent to M. Venizelos&apos; demand to leave out of the plebiscite any of the immigrants who had come to Rhodes since 1919. Other points could be settled by friendly compromise.On 9th August Sir George Grahame sent the following telegram [No. 943] from Paris :-The Italian Government proposes, as a last concession, that the League of Nations should decide how the plebiscite in Rhodes should be taken 15 years hence. M. Venizelos has accepted. The Italians have also promised full local autonomy for Castellorizo.There is now no obstacle on the Allies&apos; side to the signature of the Turkish Treaty. M. Venizelos is ready to sign to-morrow. I propose to sign the Tripartite Agreement also.M. Venizelos sends cordial thanks for the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.JAPAN.The Diet [F.C.R., xxii, p. 7].-Sir Charles Eliot reported [No. 286] from Tokio on 30th July that the special session of the Diet had terminated the previous day after a series of unusually stormy sittings. Despite violent opposition, the Government, by use of its majority in the Lower House, and by making certain of concession iri the Upper House, had succeeded in carrying through the major part of its programme. Large supplementary budgets had been adopted with slight amendments, which bring the total for the current fiscal year to about 165,000,000L, of which 70,000,000Z. was for naval and military requirements. Other important Government measures which passed the Diet provided respectively for (I) increase of income taxation ; (2) free trade between Japan and Corea; (3) amendment of the Customs Tariff Law with a view to the protection and encouragement of infant industries and prevention of dumping.The Military Attache had informed him that strong rumours were current in military circles that the Minister of AVar, Lieutenant-General Tanaka, is likely to resign in the near future. In the event of resignation he would probably be succeeded by the present Vice-Minister, Major Yamanashi.MEXICO.Relations with Great Britain [F.C.R., xxii, p. 7].-Mr. Cummins sent the following telegram [No. 183] on 4th August:-Senor Covarrubias has resigned as Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is announced in the Press that he will be sent as special envoy to England. He informed me recently that he and the Provisional President were greatly disappointed upon learning the reply given to Senor Palavicmi.
.   POLAND. -Summary of Events. -On 6th August Sir Horace Rumbold despatched the following telegram [No. 652]: Lorcl D&apos;Abernon and I Consider the followino-summaiy of events may bo useful to the Prime Minister and your Lordship in appreciating tbe present situation here :&quot;-- &apos;     &apos;22nd July. The Polish Government, acting on the advice of Piis MajestyV Government, proposed an armistice to the Soviet Government with a view to peace negotiations.23rd July. M. Chicherin telegraphed to the Polish Government that orders had. been given to the Soviet High Command to begin pourparlers immediately with a view to the conclusion of the armistice.24th July.- The Soviet Army Headquarters fixed 30th July for the reception of the Polish delegates on the Bolshevik Front, adding that this corresponded with the date proposed by the Polish Commander of the General Staff.The Polish Government protested against this representation, as it never suggested, any date, but accepted the Soviet proposal.30th July. The Polish delegates were received at the outposts.1st Aug&apos;L1-st- A forenoon meeting between the delegates at Barano-Luncze.2nd August. The Soviet, without formulating any armistice conditions, made fresh proposals for an armistice and peace negotiations at Minsk on 4th August.2nd August.-The Bolish delegates left for Warsaw to get instructions.The Soviet Government&quot;were warned that if, despite a request for an armistice-from the Polish Government, the Soviet armies continued to advance, the Allies must necessarily assume that it is the intention of the Soviet Government to make war on the Polish people. On 23rd July, i.e., the day on which the Soviet Government had accepted the Polish armistice proposal, the line reached by the Bolshevik armies was , as follows : Nowy-Dwor (south-west of Grodno) Lunno (group undecypherable) Zelwa (on Wolkowysk-Slonim road). Rozana (on Pruzana-Slonim road). Bereza-Kartuszka (on Kobryn-Bobruisk road). Janow (group unclecypherable) (on Kobryn-Pinsk road). Prywitowka, the line of the River Styr to (two groups undecypherable), the line of the-River Bug to its junction with Nurzec. thence to Niemieriki, Duplewice, Mierzwice on the Bug, line of the River Bug to Ogroclniki, through Lipnica to Mokrany, thence line of the Bug to Vladimir Volynsk-Brocl (two groups omitted), thence east of Dubno to-Ivrzomieniec and line of Zbrucz.(Two groups undecypherable) to-clay (i.e., 6th August) 14 clays have elapsed and no armistice has Been concluded, and  the Bolshevik  armies have advanced to the following line :-A point south of Ostrolenka to Pranszyck on Bug river (group-undecypherable) and the line between Strypa and Sereth.The depth of this advance is: north-east 180 kilometres, east 130, south-east 160, south 58.   The average depth 132 kilometres.Bolshevik Outrage. Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 631] from Warsaw on 3rd August that the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs had forwarded to him an official report of the assassination of 13 Polish hospital attendants and three nursing-sisters of Ambulance No. 601, committed by a detachment of Bolshevik Cavalry on 18th July at Radziwillow. - \RUMANIA.Impending lieeonstitution of Ministry. Mr. Rattigan telegraphed [No. 355] on 7th August that there was a prospect of an early reconstitution of the Ministry.   In -view of his inability to deal with the  opposition, the Brime Minister hoped to strengthen his Government by the inclusion of the Manin-Vaida group.   On the other hand, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, thinking the peasant and Socialist parties are becoming stronger, wanted to obtain the support of Michalache and Lupu.   When-Mr. Rattigan suggested to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the incorporation of both, these  associations in a   reconstituted  national Ministry,  the latter admitted the possibility of such an afrahgement; aheb proposed to suggest it to the Prime Minister.. The difficulty appears to be centred in M. Bratiano, who: will not allow any adminis-tration but his own to be possible. &apos;
Halations with Hungary. On 9th August Mr. Rattigan reported [No. 359]. as follows: The Rumanian Government now inform me : that they have appointed Colonel Starcea, late equerry to the King, as Minister&apos; at Budapest and have invited the Hungarian Government to nominate.a diplomatic representative here.I have again intervened with regard to the death sentence on Colonel Cserey and three other Hungarian officers, and the Rumanian1 Government have replied that they will try to arrange with the Hungarian Government the exchange of these prisoners and Rumanian prisoners: in Hungary. I have insisted-that Colonel Starcea should take up his post without delay.RUSSIA.. Conference in London [F.C.R., xxii, p. 9]. On 29th July the following message [No. 217] was telegraphed to Mr. Leslie, at Reval, for transmission to M. Chicherin : The British Government, having consulted its&apos; Allies, is now in a position to send the following reply to M. Chicherin&apos;s telegram of 24th July.The British Government, which, on the assumption that an armistice is about to be concluded and that hostilities are about to cease between Soviet Russia and Poland, is proposing to its Allies that they should take part in a conference to be held in London at which the Soviet Government of Russia will also be represented, considers that no doubt should be left as to the object of the meeting, as to the Powers which are to be summoned to attend it, or as to the essential subjects which it is to discuss.The last two telegrams from the Soviet Government leave some doubt upon these points. The telegram of the 19th July seems to reject the participation of the Allies in the negotiations for peace between the Soviet Government and the Polish Government and other neighbouring Governments of Russia. &quot;The last telegram, on the other hand, seems to admit this participation. . &apos;   &apos; /The British Government considers that if the ARied Governments are to meet the delegates of the Soviet Government with any chance of success, the delegates of the Polish Government, also of the other border States who are concerned, must also be present.The conference should have as its essential object the re-establishment of peace in Europe, and, in the first place, between Poland and Russia, upon conditions which would secure the independence of Poland &apos; and the legitimate interests of both countries.The conference should also consider the questions which are still outstanding between Soviet Russia and the border States which have not yet signed a definite peace with Russia.After the settlement of these questions the conference could proceed to deal with the matters in dispute between the Government of Soviet Russia and the Allies, and the re-establishment of normal relations between them.The following further message for M. Chicherin was despatched on 3rd August:--No reply has yet been received to the message which was sent to the Soviet Authorities by the British Government, after consultation with their Allies, as far&apos; back as 29th July last, proposing a conference at London, the essential object of which should be the re-establishment of peace in Europe, and, in the first place, between Poland and Russia. Meanwhile, a wireless press message has just come from Moscow, stating that the Soviet Armistice Delegation had insisted, as the condition of an armistice, on the Polish Armistice Delegation being empowered also to conclude the fundamental conditions of peace, and that the Polish delegates, not being-empowered to do so, have returned to Warsaw.The Soviet Government should realize that if they insist upon peace conditions being settled between Poland and Russia, to tbe exclusion of the other Powers, the bases on which it was proposed to conduct negotiations in London will have disappeared, and the project of a conference falls to the ground. Further, it appears that the Soviet armies have now advanced far into ethnographic Poland. If advantage be taken of the delays now caused to continue this advance, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be driven to the conclusion that it is not the intention of the Soviet Government to respect the liberty and independence of Poland and the situation contemplated in their telegram to M. Chicherin of 20th July will have arisen.To the above message M. Chicherin sent the following reply, received 5th-August: 4th August.   In reply to your message of&apos;yesterday just received ; fulL instructions up to date are being sent to M. Kameneff.   Please give orders that my 19-2 . c &apos;     -        &apos; &apos;
ibvery urgent telegram to; M. Kameneff should not be delayed on British, territory.-_Peopled Commissary for ForeignAffairs. . ; ,  -.&quot; :. &apos; ...... .....Bi0ish Subjects in Russia: [ K.CR;, xxii, p. 10J.--Mr.- Grant - Watson,/telegraphino-[No. 654] from Copenhagen oii 31st July, reported as follows :--M. Litvihoff states that as he understands that Russian prisoners are still scattered all over the British Empire, some in Egypt, some in India/ and - some even in Turkev (sic), his Government will leave It to the British-Government to fix a date at which these men can be made available for proposed exchange. On hearing frpin His MajestvV Government on this point, the Soviet Government will take the necessary steps &quot;to assemble all-British subjects in some central place for the, same purpose.The. above arrangement refers to all British subjects who come under the 0&apos;Grady agreement. As regards British subjectscommitted for grave offences, negotiations are to be completed with the Russian delegation now on the way to London, and if agreement is:reached these prisoners will be repatriated on the date agreed upon.The Russian Government will do their best to secure the release of British subjects imprisoned in Baku, but cannot make &quot;binding engagements in a matter which concerns the Government of an independent Republic. The Russian Govern-ment will support any demand made by the ; British Government directly to Azerbaijan, i In the meantime the Russian Government are doing all they can on behalf of the prisoners. M. Litvinoff trusts that His Majesty&apos;s Government will fix upon as early a date as possible.In acknowledgment of the foregoing, Lord Curzon despatched the following telegram [No. 408] to Mr. Grant Watson on - 6th August : I note with satisfaction M. Litvinoffs statement that the- Soviet Government will do their best to secure the release of British subjects imprisoned in Baku. Please request him to carry this assurance into effect without; d elay; I shotdcl welcome any means of obtaining the release of the prisoners, and should not hestitate to apply direct to the Azerbaijan Government if I were able to. do so; but messages sent to them by the British representative at Tiflis have never been acknowledged, and I have no other means of communicating with them.   I am, however, instructing him to make another attempt.On 8th August Mr. Grant Watson communicated [No. 661] the following:  M. Litvinoff states that the Russian Government wall be pleased to transmit any message His Majesty&apos;s Government may wish to convey to the Azerbaijan Government regarding British prisoners.Mr. Grant Watson sent this further message [No. 662] on 9th August: M. Litvinoff states he is once more informed, this time officially, by the Azerbaijan Government that all rumours of cruel treatment of British prisoners are untrue, that on the contrary they enjoy all kinds of privileges not accorded to other prisoners, more especially in the case of Vice-Consul Heweleke, who, contrary to rumOurs, has never been sentenced to death.

On Gth August Lord Curzon requested [No. 409] Mr. Grant AVatson to inform M. Lityinoff as follows : -The following is the result of the enquiries which I have made into his state-ments regarding assistance alleged to have been given by Great Britain to General Wrangel:  The British forces evacuated Batum on 9th July. Before that day, and since 8th June, the only stores and materials sent&apos;to the Crimea were those which were; originally destined for General Denikin, and were, on his resignation, forwarded to General Wrangel, who succeeded to his command. Between 11th and 24th May, 19 Labour leaders were arrested owing to their endeavours to instigate a general strike. None were arrested subsequently. The Russian oiler, Svet, taken over by a British company for the purpose of carrying Azerbaijan oil to the Crimea, was set on fire on 17th June as the result of the explosion.of a bomb placed on board *by a member of the crew. This had nothing to do with the British control. There is no truth in anv of the other statements made in M. Litvinoffs telegram.
Reauest for British Mediation between Russia and France.--The&apos;followirig message for communication to M. Kameneff was received on 8th August : Please communicate to the British Government. Following a conflict just arisen in consequence of some actions of the French. Naval authorities,. the Ikissian Government asks for British Government mediation. On the transports Allegrette and Baiavia, which - brought from France Russian&apos; soldiers for repatriation to Odessa, during their stay in the latter port war contraband was disclosed, namely, 28 hydroplanes. In view of the military operations proceeding in the Black Sea area against Wrangehs forces, the Russian Government cannot allow this war contraband to leave Odessa, and that the more-so in view of its being obviously destinated for Wrangel. Seeing that the Commander -of the French Fleet imperatively demands that the above contraband should be unconditionaRy allowed to leave Odessa, threatening with measures of repression, and Invoking the authority of the French Government, the Russian Government, while being fully convinced that it is completely in the right in adopting a measure of simple self-defence by preventing war material from being sent to mutineers conducting military operations against Russia, is at the same time desirous of attaining a speedy settlement of this dispute, and asks the British Government to act in this case as a mediator between Russia and France. The Russian Government brings this likewise to the knowledge of the French Government. We have the more reason to address -ourselves to the intervention of Great Britain, in view of the intimate relations of Great Britain with her ally France, and in view of the various perictise (sic) of the relations between Great Britain and Wrangel. Great Britain&apos;s response to our invitation in this matter will be, no doubt, a manifestation of the British Governments -sincerity and capacity of unbiassed impartial judgment. The greater the interest with which large numbers will look forward to the British Governments decision, the greater our readiness to follow the path of trust towards the same in this sympathetic-, case,SERBIA. .    &apos;     &quot;Resignation of M.
