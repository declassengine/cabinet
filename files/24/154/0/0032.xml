FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Internal Affairs [F.C.R., xxxi, p. 2]. According to reports received by the Viceroy and telegraphed [No. 222] by him on 2nd December, Jemal Pasha has had an interview with a deputation of muhajarin from India, and is in correspondence with India.   He and Suritz are not on good terms.The appoiutment of Nadir Khan to be Prime Minister in addition to the performance of his other duties is reported.The announcement is made in a newspaper published in Herat that Majd-Ul-Mulk has been appointed Persian Ambassador in Kabul, and is now en route to Afghanistan via Meshed.ARABIA.Messages from Bis Majesty the King and Lord Curzon.- -On 4th December the following message from His Majesty the King was sent [No. 15] to the British Agent at Jeddah for transmission to the King of the Hejaz : On the occasion of the visit of his Highness the Emir Feisal to London, I am happy to take the opportunity of informing your Majesty of the pleasure which the reception of your son has given me, and of renewing to your Majesty the expression of my personal feelings of friendship.As your Majesty is aware, it has always been my desire to maintain and strengthen the mutual bonds of friendship which were formed during the war, and I have no doubt that the visit of his Highness your son will conduce to this purpose. I thank your Majesty for the kind messages which he has conveyed to me on your behalf.On the previous day Lord Curzon had sent [No. 12] the fohowing message to the same official for transmission to King Hussein : :I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Majesty&apos;s telegram, which was communicated to me on 23rd November by Hassan Bey Khalid, and to thank you for the expressions of friendship and confidence which it contained. I can assure your Majesty that it is equally my desire to maintain and strengthen the friendly co-operation which has so characterized our relations in the past and which is so important for our mutual interests now and in the future. The welfare of the Arabs is a matter in which His Majesty&apos;s Government take the keenest interest, and your Majesty may rest assured that it is their earnest desire to assist in every way possible towards this ideal.His Majesty!s Government are glad to welcome his Highness the Emir Feisal on your behalf, and are hopeful that his visit will lead to a strengthening of the bonds of friendship between us.Hodeidah. On 13th December the Resident at Aden was informed by the Foreign Office [No. 36] that the garrison at Hodeidah would be withdrawn as soon as possible, and that he should inform the Idrisi that we bad no objection either to his arranging with the inhabitants for its future administration or to its ultimate inclusion in Asir.Idrisi and King Hussein. On 10th December Lord Curzon telegraiured as follows [No. 34] to the Resident at Aden for the information of the Iclrisi : The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government was to be on terms of friendship with all the Arabian chiefs, and to endeavour to establish similar relations between the chiefs themselves. They rely on the Idrisi to assist them in realizing this policy, and would view with the greatest concern any participation by him in an attack on King Hussein by Ibn Saud, or indeed any attempt at such attack.His Maj esty&apos;s Government. would be willing to arbitrate between the Idrisi and King Hussein in. the event of a treaty being made between them if invited by both
parties to do so, but would not be prepared to guarantee the observance of tbe terms of tbe treaty. -. Tbey are in favour of the Idrisi negotiating for suck a treaty, but not of bis forming an alliance with the King against any third party:They do not think that any advantage could be gained by a proposal that the Idrisi should mediate between King Hussein and Ibn Saud unless he were invited by both to do so.ARGENTINA.The League of Nations. In a telegram sent from Buenos Aires on 6th December Mr. Macleay expressed the opinion that the withdrawal of the Argentine delegates from the Assembly of the League of Nations must be attributed, not to any marked sympathy with Germany on the part of the Government, but to the President^ imperious nature and vanity, his contempt for parliamentary forms, his ignorance of international affairs, and his extraordinary mania for regarding himself as entrusted with a sort of divine mission to regenerate mankind in the names of reason and true democracy.ARMENIA.Decision of the League of Nations.-On 3rd December the Foreign Office transmitted [No. 25] the following message [No. 23] from Sir Maurice Hankey to Mr. Balfour, informing him that Mr. Lloyd George, M. Leygues and Count Sforza had examined the question of the admission of Armenia to the League of Nations, and that it had been decided that an identic telegram should be addressed to the heads of the British, French and Italian delegations at the Assembly of the League, the text agreed on being as foRows :  The representatives of the three Governments assembled in London, having-considered the question which has been raised at Geneva of the admission of Armenia to the League of Nations, have come to the unanimous conclusion that it is impossible to take that step at this moment because the treaty of Sevres, by which Armenia is -constituted an independent state, is not yet ratified. And, besides, the boundaries of Armenia, as they have just been defined by President Wilson, in reply to the offer of arbitration which the Powers made to him in the matter, are so extended that the Powers who belong to the League of Nations could hardly, in the light of existing -conditions, accept the responsibility to guarantee or maintain them.Armenian Soviet Republic. Colonel Stokes sent the following telegram [No. 541] from Tiflis on 1 st December : The Bolshevik press bureau (? Tiflis) announces that on 30th November the Armenians of the Delijan and Karavanserai districts established an Armenian revolutionary committee at Delijan and declared an Armenian Soviet Republic. In the manifesto this committee ask for the aid of Soviet Russia.My information is that this is not a spontaneous rising, but one organized by the Russian Bolsheviks at Baku, who sent 2,000 armed Armenians from that place for the purpose. Apparently the Bolsheviks, having been refused entry of their troops into Armenia by the Government, have decided to attempt the removal of the Government by a revolt organized by their agents, whose appeal (one group undecypherabie) assistance will afford the desired pretext for sending Bolshevik troops into Armenia.Telegraphing again [No. 544] two days later Colonel Stokes further reported as follows : The Armenian mission here [Tiflis] received news from Erivan that the Cabinet of Alatzian had resigned. Dro then became military dictator and got into touch with the Delijan revolutionary committee, whose troops were advancing on Erivan. The result has been the formation of an Armenian Soviet Government at Erivan, com-prising Dro and one other Dashnak and five others, of whom two were members of the Delijan committee. Erivan information states that 10,000 Russian Bolshevik troops have entered Armenia by the Delijan route and more are coming. Legrand has assured the Armenian Government that Armenia will be independent and Russia will cede her the district of Zangezur Nakhitchevan.
The.peace negotiations continue at Alexandropol and the Bolsheviks are taking-part in them, although for some reason.the Nationalists&apos;.will not accept Mdivani as the Bolshevik representative.AUSTRIA.Strike of Officials. On 7th December Mr. Lindley reported [No. 428] from Vienna that a strike of officials had broken out the day before in Vienna, The State Chancellor hoped that it would not spread beyond the categories then affected. The Government did not intend to raise salaries and had no means of doing so except by means of the printing press.General Depression. In his telegram No. 428 Mr. Lindley further reported that the State Chancellor had also spoken of the general depression which was spreading in the country as the result of the fear that no credits would be forthcoming. No Government could cany on without them, and he had therefore invited the American, French, Italian and British representatives to meet him on 9th December, in order that the situation might be explained. There was no doubt that the population had got uneasy since the departure of Sir William Goode, and the situation generally was becoming more unstable.THE CAUCASUS.Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. On 9th December Colonel Stokes telegraphed from Tiflis [No. 558] that :-(1) The Georgian Government on 7th December informed Moscow that it had reason to believe that Armenia and Azerbaijan contemplated attacking Georgia without the knowledge of Moscow, and requested Moscow to restrain them.(2) The Georgian Government on 8th December telegraphed to Moscow, Baku and Erivan expressing its desire to live at peace with its neighbours and its readiness to settle any matter in dispute in a friendly manner.(3) The Armenian Government has to-day telegraphed to Georgia requesting the immediate withdrawal of the Georgian troops from the disputed zone, and free transit across Georgia of goods for Armenia. The Georgian representative at Erivan has been arrested in his own house.CHILE,League of Nations. Telegraphing from Santiago on Ilth December [No. 200], Mr. Michell reported that no alteration would be made in the present policy of the Chilean Government, whose intention it was to march hand in hand with Great Britain. It had been unanimously decided at a joint meeting of the foreign relations com-mittees of the two Chambers that Chile should continue to participate in the conferences of the League of Nations, and that it was considered inopportune at the present time to press the^principles enunciated by the Argentine Government however much the Chilean Government-might sympathize with some of them. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the President-Elect and the Chilean Minister to Great Britain were present at this meeting.CHINA.Looting at Tehang. Mr Clive telegraphed from Peking [No. 514] on 4th December that the consul at Tchang had reported that on the night of 29th-30th November the eity had been looted by local troops. The damage to property in general was large and the Japanese had lost heavily ; otherwise, although the situation was described as being still precarious, foreigners and their property had been, on the whole, respected. British property lost was mainly in the hands of native agents. British gunboats had proceeded to Shasi and Tchang, where a Japanese man-of-war was also expected.
GREECE.Protest against the Issue of Notes. On 3rd December Lord Granville was instructed [No. 221] to communicate to the Greek Government the following decision which had been arrived at by the three Great Powers in conference that afternoon : The British, French and Italian Governments having learnt that the Greek Government has issued without their authority notes of the National Bank of Greece to a further amount of 200,000,000 drachmas, make a formal protest against this action. Notice of the objection to this issue had been given, and the Powers declare that they consider it a violation of the financial agreements binding upon Greece, as this new issue of bank notes was not covered, as the Greek law required, by corresponding foreign credits.Lord Granville reported [No. ? 338] on 13th December as follows :-The International Financial Commission, desirous of asserting their position, wrote officially to the Minister of Finance on 9th December, demanding information regarding the alleged issue of notes without awaiting the consent of the commission, as required by Article 30 of the Law of Control. The Minister of Finance sent a long answer on 11th December, admitting tbe issue of half by his predecessor and half by himself, and excusing his action on the ground that he had reason to believe that the three Governments had given, or were about to give, consent, and that the official consent of tbe commission was merely a formality. The commission have rejoindered to-day making a formal protest against this violation of the Convention and Law of 1898, on the strict observance of which- it is tbe duty of the commission to insist.Cessation, of Financial Assistance on the Return of King Constantine. On 4th December Lord Grauville was informed [No. 222] that at a conference between the Allied representatives that day it had been agreed that, in the event of the return of Constantine to the throne of Greece, no further financial assistance would be granted to that country, and that the two financial commissions should receive formal instructions to that effect.Lord Granville was instructed to make a formal communication in this sense to the Greek Government, and was told that his colleagues were being instructed to do the same.HOLLAND.Diplomatic Rupture with Serbia. Telegraphing [No. 174] from the Hague on 13th December, Sir Ronald Graham sent the following report : An incident has occurred. leading to the rupture of diplomatic relations between the Netherlands and Serbia.The Dutch consul at Belgrade, named Ropopoff, an Austrian subject, had been imprisoned during the war without the Netherlands Government being informed. In August last, while negotiations were proceeding between the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Serbian Minister here on the subject, Ropopoff was suddenly expelled from Serbia at 21 hours&apos; notice. 23-3, BRelations with the Far Eastern Republic. Mr. Glive despatched the following telegram [No. 517] on 6th December :-Yonrin, the president of the mission from the &quot;Far Eastern Republic, has had a private interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and on 30th November wrote an official note suggesting au early restoration of normal relations. To this end he proposes a radical revision of all former Chinese-Russian treaties whereby the special privileges hitherto enjoyed by Russians are abolished as being derogatory to Southern China, but, before economic relations can be restored on a large scale, he urges the necessity of reciprocal consular representatives. Only less important is an agreement in regard to the Chinese Eastern Railway &quot;wherein the interests of the rights and the obligations regarding the two sides should be fully guaranteed in accordance with the principle of mutual justice.&quot; I learn from the old Russian Legation that there are six commissions in Yourin&apos;s mission: - (1) Political; (2) Economic ; (3) Purchasing ; (4) Military; (5) Propaganda; (6) Mongolian affairs.The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that, before seriously negotiating, the Chinese Government had asked for assurances in regard to propaganda, indemnification for Chinese losses in Siberia, and the respect of Chinese frontiers by the Red troops.
The Netherlands Minister at Belgrade presented a protest to the Serbian Government, who refused to accept it and returned it to him. An appeal was made to M. A7esnitch personally, but he replied that he approved and had inspired this action.In the circumstances the Netherlands Government have withdrawn their Minister from Belgrade, and have informed the Serbian Charge d&apos;Affaires ait the Hague that, his presence here is no longer desired.&quot;    JAPAN.Press Charge against Missionaries. Sir Charles Eliot reported from Tokio on. 11th December [No. 461] that the papers of 8th December had published a statement described as having been issued by the War Department to the press. It directly accuses the missionaries of encouraging an insurgent band, and said that the Coreans should be awakened to the fact that their real grievance was against these mischief-making missionaries. He had drawn the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to these statements and the latter had expressed the greatest regret, adding that he was endeavouring to arrange for the immediate publication of a disclaimer.   None, however, had yet appeared.He had spoken very strongly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and pointed out that, though the language of himself and his colleagues was invariably courteous and friendly, the same could not be said about the acts of the police and the judicial authorities in the Shaw case or the conduct of the military authorities in the Chientao affair. The public judged by the reports which appeared in the press, and, if the Japanese Government did not correct those reports by their acts or by official disclaimers, the indignation which was prevalent among the British communities in China would extend to Great Britain.MEXICO.Relations with the United States of America. Telegraphing from Mexico on 2nd December Mr. Cummins reported [No. 249] that a Washington telegram declared that the American State Department had proposed that the Governments of the United States and Mexico should each appoint a representative to draw up a treaty embodying the agreements reached at the discussions which had taken place preliminary to the recognition of Mexico by the United States.PERSIA.Delay in opening the Medjliss. In a telegram [No. 790] dated 5th December, Mr. Norman reported the difficulties which the Persian Government had to contend with, and their efforts to hasten the opening of the Medjliss. Elected deputies, who also hold official posts, have been informed that they will be dismissed from their office whether they take their seats or not, so that they will have no inducement to resign their seats in order to retain office. Certain deputies of the Fars district have declined to leave for Teheran, so that either their constituencies will remain unrepresented or a forced resignation will entail the delay necessitated by fresh elections. From Khorassan two deputies have refused to obey the summons to attend and have preferred to resign on the plea of ill-health and inability to face the cold weather in travelling.Closing of Russian Consulates. On 8th December Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 799] as follows : The Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires has received instructions from Paris to shut all Russian consulates in Persia, as there is no longer enough money available to maintain them, and to send away all the staff of the Legation except three. The officials concerned have not been paid for some time, and his resources only permit him to provide for 30 per cent, of the arrears of salary due to them. Exchange nas also lately become much less favourable to holders of Persian currency.In these circumstances he has asked me whether it would be possible to provide free transport for the officials who have to leave, or if not. to permit them to travel on favourable terms, as if this is not done he will be unable to carry out his instructions to send them away.
The General Officer Commanding, Norperforce, is willing to provide transport if I demand it, hut I feel nnable to do this without a previous assurance that your Lordship&apos;s department will admit liability when the War Office ask for repayment of the expense involved.The position of the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires here is for many reasons difficult, and I venture to recommend his request to your favourable consideration.Passages are at present required for four persons to Marseilles, three to Poland, and one to Bombay, and there may be two or three further applications later. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Meshed is providing transport for members of the Russian consulate-general there.In reply to this Mr. Norman was informed on 15th December [No. 601] that no liability could be accepted for the expenditure involved, but that inqruries were being-made as to whether the representative of the former Russian regime would undertake to pay if the required facilities were granted.Settlement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The following message [No. 595] Avas transmitted by the Foreign Office to Mr. Norman on 11th December : -The Financial Adviser begs that you will inform the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance that his negotiations with the Oil Company have been completely successful.The interpretation of the agreement for the future has been settled ; the compam- have withdrawn their counter-claim and have agreed to pay the Persian Government the sum of 1,000,000L sterling in respect of the period ending 31st March 1919. This sum includes 192,000L already paid. A fuller telegram will be sent so soon as the necessary legal documents have been signed, and a complete report will be presented to the Cabinet in due course.The Financial Adviser requests an acknowledgment.POLAND.General Political Situation. Sir Percjr Loraine reported from Warsaw on 30th November [No. 1071] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Prince Sapieha, had made a statement on the general political situation to the representatives of the Polish press to the following effect---The alleged union between General Zeligowski and the troops of Balahovitch was cprite untrue ; General ZeligoAvski would not change the loyal attitude adopted in agreement with the Polish Government and the League of Nations commission. The Riga negotiations were proceeding tranquilly. Both the Polish Government and the Supreme Commission were strictly observing the obligations undertaken in the peace preliminaries. A keen desire on the Polish side to secure a final peace was accompanied by the conviction that if compelled to renew the war Poland Avas capable of waging it, and of victory. He himself was deeply convinced that the BolsheAuks likewise did not desire to recommence Avar, and he thought that Poland Avas not threatened by war either uoav or in the spring, but she ought nevertheless to remain vigilant.The Bolsheviks.  On 1st December Sir Percy Loraine reported [No. 1077] that.in a conversation with Prince Sapieha the latter had said that he was absolutely convinced that the Bolsheviks were physically unable to attack Poland ; their main concentration was on the Dnieper, their forces in the North being very feeble. He added that Poland was similarly quite unable now to attack Russia, but if attacked could probably just give the Bolsheviks another thrashing ; (three groups undecypherabie) mention hints of a real desire on the part of the Bolsheviks to sign a final peace treaty with as little delay as possible.Influx of Jews. Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed on 4th December [No. 1037] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had told him that large numbers of Jews from Bessarabia, stampeded by the belief that the Bolsheviks would shortly enter that province, were flocking over the Polish frontier, and that it had been impossible to stop them by peaceful methods. As Poland Avas already SAvamped by refugees, mainly of an undesirable character, she could not possibly stand the strain of this fresh influx, and the permission sought by the Minister of War to stop it by force if necessary had therefore been granted.23-3 C
Repatriation of War Hostages and Exiles.-Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed as follows [No. 1101] on 7th December: The press department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announces that the inter-ministerial commission for prisoners of war, hostages, and exiles, has formulated a scheme for repatriating from Russia 15,000 persons a month.The Bolshevik delegation at Riga is, however, making difficulties as regards this repatriation, is trying to use it ns a lever for other negotiations, refuses to exchange prisoners of war until the final peace treaty is put into force, and will only permit the return of such re-emigrants as were resident in Poland before the war, who will each be allowed to take property only up to 330 lbs. in weight and 20,000 roubles.The Polish delegation is rejecting these proposals and putting forward others, meanwhile requesting that the three agreements concluded between Poland and the Russian Red Cross societies should be observed. The Bolsheviks contend that these agreements lapsed on conclusion of the preliminary peace treaty.Commercial Treaty unth France. Sir Percy Loraine reported on 8th December [No. 1102] that Prince Sapieha had informed him that the Polish draft of a proposed treaty of commerce with France had been sent to Paris for examination and approval. This draft was the outcome of considerable negotiations, and Prince Sapieha had said that he had been very careful to eliminate clauses which would have given France preferential treatment, and he was sure that the advantages given to that countrv could perfectly well be given to the other Allies.PORTUGAL.New Cabinet Sir Lancelot Carnegie reported on 1st December [No. 113] that Colonel Librato Pinto, chief of the general staff of the Republican Guard, and a Democrat deputy, had formed a new Government, or, rather, reconstructed the last one with the participation of Democrats, so that a majority&apos; in the Chamber was secured.   The Minister for Foreign Affairs was unchanged.On the following clay The Times gave the following list of the members of the new Cabinet: Senhor Librato Pinto (Democrat)   -Senhor Augusto Nobre (Democrat) Senhor Gomes (Democrat) - - - -Senhor Domingues Dos Santos (Democrat) Senhor Alvaro de Castro (Reconstituent) Senhor Lopez Cardoso (Reconstituent) Senhor Antonio Fonseca (Reconstituent) -. -Senhor Dominos Pereira (Leader of the DemocraticDissident Group) -Senhor Julio Martins (Popular Party) Senhor Cunha Leal (Popular Party) Senhor John Goncalves (Independent)RUSSIA.The Soviet Government and the Allied Warning to Greece. The following tele-gram, dated 8th December, from M. Chicherin, was received on 11th December:   To the Governments of Great Britain, France and Italy : It has come to the knowledge of the Russian Soviet Government that the Governments of Great Britain, France and Italy have addressed a note to the Hellenic Government, warning it that in the case of the restoration of the exiled King Constantine to the throne they would reserve their liberty of action, that is, take reprisals against Greece in the shape, presumably, of a diplomatic boycott and economic blockade or other penal measures. The Russian Soviet Government has no sympathy with monarchies and kings, but it has a good deal with a people which, like its own, has resolved, though in an inadequate manner, against a policy of war and conquest imposed upon it by an imperialist regime with the aid of foreign bayonets. The Russian Government, therefore, while utterly repudiating the traditions of the late Tsardom in using Russia s position as one of the three pro-tectino- Powers of Greece and correspondingly denouncing the similar practices of Great Ilritain and France, nevertheless in the name of the principle of the right of prime Minister and Interior.Instruction.Colonies.Labour.War.Justice.Commerce.Foreign. Marine. Finance. Agriculture.
every nation to determine its own political administration aud to select its rulers, protests in the strongest manner possible against the brutal act of interference with the internal affairs of the Hellenic people now committed by the Allied Governments. The Soviet Government is firmly convinced that the day is not distant when the labouring masses of Greece will of their own free will find means to free themselves of the unsolicited tutorship of the imperialist Powers.Relations with Rumania. The following wireless message was sent to M. Take Jonescu by M. Chicherin on 14th December :-The Russian Government take note of the declarations contained in your radio of 30th November respecting your intention not to authorize any infraction of Rumania&apos;s neutrality in the strictest sense of the term. They cherish the firm hope that the Rumanian Government will not tolerate any violation of this principle. The Russian Government would be, in addition, highly grateful to you if you would furnish them with exact and detailed particulars as to the armed forces of the counter-revolutionary rebels, who, according to your telegram, have been disarmed by the Rumanian authorities. I venture to repeat that the Rumanian Government, hy manifesting in these questions the genuineness of their peaceful and friendly sentiments towards Russia, will facilitate by that very means a favourable solution of the questions which may be discussed at the conference proposed by us to take place between Russia and Rumania,Siberia.The Far Eastern Republic. Mr. Paton telegraphed [No. 132] as follows from Vladivostock on 2nd December : After heavy fighting up to 20th November, General Seminoffs forces were finally overthrown and driven across the Chinese border at Manchuria, where they were disarmed by the Chinese. A considerable number fled into Mongolia. Altogether about 15,000 troops and refugees had entered the town of Manchuria hy 23rd November, and are now scattered in groups along the Chinese Pastern railway. 2,000 or 3,000 have made their way into the Maritime Province. The Japanese have declared that they are in no way concerned with the movement of these disarmed forces over the Chinese Eastern railway into the Maritime Province, and that it is a matter for the Chinese authorities and the Vladivostock Government. General Seminoff arrived here on 28th November under a Japanese guard.As the whole of Trans-Bakalia is now in the hands of Jhe Far Eastern Republic interest centres in the decision of the Vladivostock Government. The question of the recognition of the Chita Government has been debated -hy the assembly for several days, but owing to the uncertainty regarding M. Chita&apos;s professed democratic policy, the majority of the members appear anxious to defer the decision as long as possible.Considerable importance attaches to the communication from the Japanese chief of staff to the Vladivostock Government, pointing out that complications may arise if the Vladivostock assembly recognizes M. Chita and dissolves, that the Japanese have not yet established official intercourse with the Chita Government, and that orders from the latter might contravene agreements already made with the Vladivostock Government : in this event the Japanese military authorities might be compelled to take the necessary measures in direct negotiation with the Vladivostock Government. This attitude has strengthened the non-recognition party, and the probability now is that while M. Chita will be recognized, the Vladivostock assembly will remain with full powers of vetoing any measures considered communistic.SERBIA.Proclamation of a Croatian Republic. On 8th December Sir Alban Young reported [No. 3S7] that a telephone message from Zagreb had just been received by one of his colleagues stating that M. Radio had proclaimed a Croatian (? Republic), and was sending a delegation of 28 members to Belgrade to negotiate with the Government. NoKdisturbances had taken place.In a telegram sent the day before [No. 386], Sir Alban said that an official com-munique had been made to the press to the effect that the recent elections were held in the whole country, as in a country one and indivisible : and a warning was given that, the Government would not permit any disturbances. M. Radic&apos;s attitude would probably be that Croatia should negotiate with Serbia for the constitution of the union.
TURKEY.Ratification.-0 n 2nd December Sir Horace Rumbold sent the following-telegram [No. 1266] from Constantinople : The Porte has replied to the joint note that the Turkish Government is willing; to give satisfaction to the request of the Allied Powers, and has only postponed ratification (? owing to the) conviction that it was necessary first to establish contact with Angora. ..The Turkish Government, when fixing a time limit of one month, had hoped that contact would have been effected earlier, but material difficulties had supervened delaying the departure of the delegates until 3rd December.The Turkish Government hope that these circumstances may be taken into consideration, and that the Allies will accept that the treaty be ratified after the mission has got into touch with Angora.The next Ambassador to England. On 5th December Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 1278] that the Turkish Government had stated their intention to eventually accredit Reshid Pasha as Ambassador. They said that he could not leave for some weeks, and asked if Raghib Rail, Bey might be sent at once to prepare the embassy, and establish preliminary unofficial contact with the Foreign Office. Raghib was to have arrived in the London embassy before the war. 1 know of no objection to him.
