In a telegram. [No. 91] from Vienna, dated 2nd&quot; April, Mr. Lindley made the following report: -The National Assembly met yesterday to consider the question of the ex-Emperor. All parties declared their determination to uphold the Republic. The Social democratic party asked the Govem-inent the following five questions : (1) Is the Government ready to inform the Great Powers and succession States that Austria regards any restoration of the Habsburgs in Hungary as a menace to the security of the Austrian Republic ?(2) Is the Government ready to press the Powers to ratify and carry out as soon as possible the Hungarian peace treaty, especially as regards the transfer of West Hungary and the reduction of the Hungarian army to its treaty strength?(;3) Will the Government take all military measures necessary to guard the frontier ?(!) Is the;government ready to arrest the ex-Emperor should lie enter Austria, and to transport him as a prisoner with all precautions necessary to avoid any -disturbance of order?
(5) Will the Government prosecute . all. persons implicated. in --the ex-Emperor&apos;&quot; journeys through Austria&apos;?The Chancellor replied to all the questions, except No. (4), in the affirmative. To-this question he answered that the Government would take all measures necessary to-avoid any disturbance during the journey in consultation with the leaders of the-various Parliamentary parties, and with the representatives of Great Britain, France,., and Italy, who had expressed a desire to superintend the journey.This last statement is not strictly accurate, as- you will have observed from my telegrams, but the Chancellor made use of it in order to resist the demand of the-social democrats that the escort should consist of representatives of the army and other-social democratic organisations. &apos;-: -&apos; - &apos; At the end of the debate the following resolution put Jorward by the pan-Germans-was unanimously accepted : &quot;The National Assembly call attention to the fact that, on Ilth November 1918 the late Emperor undertook to recognise the decision of the Austrian peopleaegarding: their form of Government. The National Assembly declares that the Austrian people have expressed this decision by electing a constituent assembly which has voted, unanimously for the republican federal constitution. The National Assembly declares that the Austrian people remains determined to defend the peaceful development of&quot; the republican federal state against every threat from without or *from within. The national Assembly calls on the-Federal Government to oppose energetically every menace against the Republic by all means of foreign and internal policy.&quot;BELGIUM.Miners&apos; Wages. On 30th March Sir George Grahame telegraphed [No. CO] from-. Brussels as follows : Through the intermediary of the Commission Mixte des Alines, the wages of coal miners have recently twice been reduced by 5 per cent, The-Commission was originally instituted in April 1919 to examine the application to coal mining of the eight-hour day, and was subsequently reconstituted in the beginning-of 1920 for the solution of all questions concerning coal mines. It is composed of delegates, employers and. miners&apos; associations, and the Belgian Government is represented by two delegates.The basis upon, which increase or reduction is calculated is the index cost of living.   In the past, as the Cost of living increased, higher wages were decided upon by the Commission;, and their action has been seconded by the Government by increasing the price of coals.   The recent falling of food prices has enabled&apos; a -reduction in miners&apos; wages and the price of coals.c CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.The Hungarian Situation.- Lord Hardinge, telegraphing [No. 180] from Paris on-4th April, said that the Pet it Paris ien had that clay published a telegram from the Czecho-Slovak Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated 3rd April, in response to a request for his views oh the Hungarian situation, to the effect that Czecho-Slovakia and other-members of the little Entente would never tolerate the return of any llapsburg, and would, require effective guarantees against the recurrence of recent- events; that all necessary military preparations had been made in Slovakia and &quot; if the adventure is not definitely ended on 7th April, the first measures will be applied; &quot; that Hungary&apos;s neighbours have lost all confidence in her, and that democratic Central Europe will, be on guard against the dangerous reaction &quot;now being prepared&quot; at Budapest,. Munich, and possibly Berlin ; that the elements favourable to Karl are more powerful than is generally realised ; and &quot; we have every right to intervene energetically in the-interest of peace in Europe.&quot;FRANCE.The French. Government and ex-King Charles. On 2nd April Lord Hardinge telegraphed [No. 179] as follows :; I have made inquiries from different sources and can find no confirmation of the-report that the President of the Council encouraged the ex-King Charles to return to-
Hungary. The Ministry-of Foreign Affairs flatly&apos; denied the statement made by the ex-king/ that the French Government were in favour of his return; and, in order to riiake?their attitude quite clear, the French commissioner at Pesth was authorized to issue&apos;a formal dementi, and it was with the same object that the initiative was taken by the French Government in making the declaration accepted yesterday by the conference of Ambassadors against the return of the Habsburgs. This has since been published in the press. On the other hand, there is no doubt whatever that the ex-King received encouragement from certain society circles in Paris where catholic and old French aristocratic families meet, and of this evidence has been given by articles which have appeared in the Figaro and the Gaulois during the last few days. It is my firm conviction that M. Briand had nothing to do with it,;  GERMANY.America, and Reparation. Telegraphing [No. 129] from Berlin on 30th March, Lord D&apos;Abernou reported that the American Commissioner, under instructions from his Government, had informed him that about a fortnight ago he had had an informal conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of reparations and that the latter had subsequently sent him, unofficially, a memorandum embodying the views of the German Government on the question, to which the United States Government had now sent a reply of which the following was the text: &quot;The American Government is pleased to note, in the informal memorandum of Dr. Simons, the unequivocal expression on the part of the German Government of its desire to afford reparation up to the limit of German ability to pay. This Government stands with the Governments of the Allies in holding Germany responsible for the war, and therefore morally bound to make reparation so far as may be possible. Recognition of this obligation is implied in the memorandum of Dr. Simons, and seems to the Government of the United States the only sound basis on which can be built a firm and just peace under- which the various uations of Europe can achieve once more economic stability. This Government believes that it recognizes in the memorandum of Dr. Simons, a sincere desire on the part of the German Government to reopen negotiations with the Allies on a new basis, and hopes that such negotiations, once resumed, may lead to a prompt settlement which will at the same time satisfy the just claims of the Allies and permit Germany hopefully to renew its productive activities.&quot;Upper Silesia. -The following telegram [No. 52] was sent from Oppeln by-Colonel Percival on 27th March : The situation in Beuthen, Kattowitz, and Pless appears to be becoming calmer. The Polish press continues to represent the result of tlie plebiscite as a great Polish victory.. It now claims that the territory covered by Lublinitz, Gross Strehlitz, Gleiwitz town and land, Beuthen town and land, Eattowitz town and land, Pless, Konigshute, Zabrze, Tarnowitz, and Rybnik districts should be handed over to Poland, because in this territory Poland has 52 per cent, votes. The German majority in the above area of Beuthen, Gleiwitz, and Eattowitz is ignored or deliberately misrepresented as not being a German majority. Neither does the Polish press take into account that, if the Poles are permitted to link up the Pless and Rybnik areas to the industrial area and to Lublinitz, Gross Strehlitz, and Gleiwitz land for the purpose of bolstering up the Polish minority in these areas, the Germans must be accorded the same right of. linking up Kreutzburg, Rosenberg, Oppeln town and land and Oosel, not to mention Leobshutz and Ratibor, to reinforce the German majority. Another method adopted by the Polish press is to give the results in the area they claim by communes ; by this method a large town of, say, 80,000 inhabitants counts no more than a rural commune of, say, 100 inhabitants, as each counts as one unit only. Even according^ to this method, Germany has a large majority if Upper Silesia is taken as a whole, but not in the area selected by the Poles. This form of deception is particularly striking when represented in maps ; as large towns with their enormous German majorities are hardly noticeable in comparison with rural communes with moderate Polish majorities.GREECE.England and the Greek Operations. -On 23rd March Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 50] to Lord Granville that it was quite untrue to suggest that the Greek Govern-in ont had received any encouragement from the British Government to undertake
any offensive operations in Asia Minor. It had been made clear to both the Turkish and Greek delegations at the recent conference hi London that unless and until-.an agreement had been reached as to the modification of the treaty of Sevies Jon. the lines proposed by the principal allied Powers, those Powers could undertake no responsibility, for restraining either of the two parties from such movements as they might consider.;necessary to secure the safety of their armies, and that the responsi-bility- for such-movements must rest on those who took them.&apos; Turkish Prisoners of War in charge of Japanese Officers.-On 3rd April Lord Granville reported [No. 158] that the Greek Government,. having learnt that a Japanese ship had sailed from Port Said for Constantinople on 1st April with 100 Turkish officers and 1,000 men, prisoners of war, being repatriated in charge of Japanese officers, had issued instructions to Greek men-of-war to stop the ship, explain that Greece was again at war with Turkey and insist on the Turks being-landed at Mitylene as Greek prisoners; but if the Japanese should ask to land them in some neutral country this was to be allowed.The Minister for Foreign Affairs not knowing how to communicate with the Japanese Government had telegraphed to the Greek Charge d&apos;Affaires in London to speak to the Japanese Ambassador.ITALY.The ex-Emperor Gharles.-8ir George Buchanan telegraphed [No. 103] as follows from Rome on 3rd April :-The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated in the Senate yesterday that there was perfect agreement between the Allies about the desirability of the ex-Emperor&apos;s departure from Hungary, that steps had been taken at Vienna with a view to his receiving a safe conduct from (group omitted), and that the Italian Government would make no difficulties about his crossing Italian territory to go to Spain or elsewhere if desired. Italy had anticipated the danger of the return of the Habsburgs by concluding a formal agreement on the subject with the Jugo-Slav Government, supplemented by an exchange of views with the Czecho-Slovak Government. The ex-Emperor s action was embarrassing for Hungary and an ill-reward for the sacrifice of Hungarian life during the war in the Habsburg cause. Everyone in Hungary knew that neither Italy nor the other neighbouring states would ever allow the Emperor s restoration. His adherents consisted of only a few aristocratic Magyar families and the hulk f people were not in. sympathy with his Intrigues.JAPAN.Government Measures. On 28th March Mr. Gurney sent the following message [No. 120] from Tokio : The budget has passed both Houses and the Diet was closed yesterday. Another resolution of non-confidence in the Minister for Education was defeated in the Lower House on 24th March. Among the laws passed were the following : Rice storage, loau line, naval fuel, labour exchanges, aviation, prohibiting manufacture of sulphur matches. Amendments were made in the following laws :  Patents, trade-marks, tariff, weights and measures. The amendments in the last contemplate the substitution within 20 years of the metric system for the existing Japanese.PERSIA.The Shafts Movements [F.C.R., xxxix, p. 5].-On 25th March Mr. Norman reported [No. 182] that early in the month the Shah had obtained a promise from the Prime Minister that he would be allowed to start for Europe after 21st March, the Persian new year&apos;s day, provided he first came to Teheran and made public expression of his confidence in the new Government. Later on the Shah refused to comply with this condition, whereupon the Prime Minister sent the commander of the Cossack division to tell him that he would not be permitted to go, as his departure would be a danger to the country. The Shah was frightened and settled his differences with the Prime Minister, and proceeded to fulfil the condition by coming to Teheran and publicly expressing his satisfaction with the Government. Upon this the Prime Minister informed him that he could leave at the end of May if he wished it. -
South Persia Rifles [F.G.R., xxxix, p. 5]. Telegraphing [No. 192] on 31st March Mr. Norman reported, the official announcement by the Persian Government of&quot; the dissolution of the South Persia. Rifles which force will be incorporated in the gendarmerie. British officers serving with the force will be. dismissed, but at the same time the Government asks for facilities to engage in the gendarmerie one lieutenant-colonel, fourteen officers on the active list., three military doctors, three veterinary surgeons, and one civilian accountant. These numbers were in accordance with a scheme drawn up by the Inspector-General of the South Persia Rifles at the request of the Persian Government. The object of transforming this military force into gendarmerie is to deprive the Russian Soviet Government of grounds for saying that the Persian Government was forming an army under British officers. Mr. Norman had intimated the sanction of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the proposal.RUSSIA.Siberia.Declaration of the Chita- Constituent Assemblij. Telegraphing [No. 43] from Vladivostock on 4th April, Mr. Paton reported that on 22nd March the Chita Constituent Assembly unanimously adopted a declaration embodying the following main points : -Article 1.   The territory of Far Eastern Republic to comprise Trans-Baikal, Amur, the maritime provinces, and North Saghalien. 2: Defines boundaries.3. The presence of foreign troops regarded as a violation of international law.4. The treaty rights of the former Russian empire in the Chinese Eastern Railway are acquired by the republic, to be revised by mutual agreement between the Far Eastern Soviet and Chinese republics.5. The government to be based on democratic principles.6. Class distinctions and privileges to be abolished and citizens guaranteed inviolability of person, domicile, correspondence, freedom of the press, speech, meetings, unions, strikes, religion and travel.7. Corporal and capital punishment to be abolished.8. Amnesty for political offenders.9. The private property of citizens and foreigners to be respected : restrictions admissible only in the interests of the entire nation and in. cases to be precisely defined in.the constitution.10. Laud, forests, and waters to be inalienable national property.11. Open door for foreign commerce : measures to be taken to attract foreign capital for the development of natural resources without infringing the sovereign rights of the people, provision being made for the protection of the rights of workers.12. Native tribes and national minorities guaranteed the right of broad autonomy necessary for development.In an address to the nations of the world an appeal is made for the recognition of the republic.Situation caused by the presence of Semenoff&apos;s and KappeVs Forces in the Maritime Province. On 2nd April Mr. Paton telegraphed [No. 47] as follows : Since December last the arrival of semenoff&apos;s and KappePs forces from Trans-Baikal into the south of the maritime province has resulted in the creation in the latter district of a reactionary centre over which the Vladivostock administration have been able to exercise little or no control. Possessed of little Rmds, these men have on several occasions taken the law into their own hands. The Chita Government has frequently requested permission from the Japanese commandant to send troops from the north to suppress them, but has been refused. Nor do the Japanese themselves appear to have made serious efforts to control them.Considerable number have also found their way into Vladivostock, where their presence has given rise to frequent rumours of an impending coup, and during the past 10 days a conference in Vladivostock of non-socialistic parties has tended to confirm these reports.General Lokhvitsky aud other prominent anti-Bolshevik leaders attended the conference, where plans for future Government were discussed with the view to making the maritime province (? the base) for anti-Bolshevik activities. On 30th March 27-1 0
news of a projected coup to take place the some night reached the local authorities. A council meeting was at once held at which the Japanese commander-in-chief, who was present, promised to suppress any armed attack. Authorities began to arrest the supposed leaders of the movement, including General Lokhvitsky, and this precipitated whatever measures may- have been contemplated.&apos; General Lokhvitsky was soon released by a party of his own officers, and street lighting commenced and lasted until the morning when the opposition party was driven out of tbe town. Casualties were few.   The Japanese took no,part in the street fighting.The peopled assembly at the meeting on 31st March decided to press the Japanese commandant to fulfil the agreements signed after the coup of 4th April and (? 25th) last to prevent the entrance of anti-Government forces into the area guarded by Japanese troops. &apos;,The Russian militia continue to police the town, but the incident has strengthened the Japanese claim that Japanese troops must be retained in the maritime province to maintain orderSERBIA,Relations with Bulgaria. On 3rd April Lord Granville reported [No. 159] that the Serbian Minister had made an official communication to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, giving the fullest assurances that there was no question of an agreement between the Serb-Croat-Slovene kingdom and Bulgaria.TURKEY.-England and the Greek Offensive. On 23rd March Lord Curzon informed [No. 180] Sir Horace Rumbold that Certain interested sources had, according to information in the possession of His Majesty s Government, endeavoured to accredit the fiction that countenance had been given by His Maj esty &apos;s* Government to a &quot;resumption of hostilities by the Greek troops in Asia Minor. It was quite untrue to suggest that the Greek Government had received any encouragement from&quot; the British Government to undertake any offensive operations in Asia Minor. It had been made clear to both the Turkish and the Greek delegation at the recent conference in London that unless and until an agreement was reached as to the modification of the treaty of Sevres on the lines proposed by the principal allied powers, those powers, could undertake no responsibility for the restraining of either of the two parties from such movements as they might consider necessary to secure the safety of their armies, and that the responsibility for such movements must rest on those who took them.Protests against, the Greek Offensive. On 25th March Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 210] that he had received a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs protesting formally against the Greek offensive, of which the Porte had learnt with pained surprise through an official communique in the local press.The note stated that this unjustifiable aggression had occurred at a moment when the Allies were endeavouring to find a peaceful solution for the eastern question, and was calculated to complicate the situation seriously, and to lead to tbe gravest consequences. It requested him to draw His Majesty-fe Governments serious attention to these facts, and to the Porte&apos;s protest against the conduct of the Gircek Government, which must bear the entire responsibility for its eventual results.On 5th April Sir Horace further reported [No. 239] that in a note, just received, the Turkish Government had Complained that the Greeks were conducting belligerent operations in the Straits and in the Sea of Marmora, such as embarkation and disembarkation of troops, material of war, &amp;c.The note pointed out that the Greek Government had undertaken operations in Anatolia on its own account without any mandate from the principal allied Powers, and that at a moment when the Powers were endeavouring to solve the eastern problem in a pacific manner, Greek action could only have had in view the realization by force of arms (? of illegitimate) ambitions. Further, the fact that the principal allied Powers had announced their neutrality proved that the Greek proceedings were not approved by them.The Turkish Government pointed out that in view of the principles which the allied Great Powers themselves wished to enforce, no belligerent or hostile action -could be exercised in the Straits or in the Sea of Marmora, nor could any foreign.
&quot;belligerent embark or disembark troops or munitions of war in those waters. &quot;Greece, therefore, was not entitled to conduct the operations in question (?in those)-- waters.The Turkish Government was therefore convinced that as the allied Powers- occupied the Straits and the Sea of Marmora they would recognize that it was their duty to ensure the strict observance by Greece of the above-mentioned principles.Recriminatory Charges [F.G.R., xxxix, p. 8]. On 5th  April  the following message [No. 116] was transmitted from the Foreign Office to Sir George Buchanan -at Pome, for communication to the President of the Angora Delegation -&quot;Your letter undated was received here on 1st April relative to the alleged persecution of Moslems by Greeks.   The Hellenic authorities allege that Kemalist bands pillaged and tortured Greek and Armenian Christians for three days in the -district of Caesarea, and massacred many.2. Bands of Turkish irregulars also massacred Greeks in and around Ayasoluk, -also mutilating at least one body.   The Metropolitan Bishop of Sokia, after imprison-ment, was removed from the town and his fate is unknown, while many Greeks of : Sokia have been arrested and imprisoned.3. In view of these allegations, and until proof is forthcoming that the Moslems -are being restrained effectively, you will readily understand that neither sympathy nor effective intervention can be expected from His Majesty&apos;s Government.
