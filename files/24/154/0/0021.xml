FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Raiding by Jamshidis [F.C.R., xx, p. 2]. The Viceroy of India telegraphed [No. 200] on 1st July that reports had been received which indicated that the Amir was becoming more suspicious of Bolshevik designs against Bokhara and on the Herat frontier. The Governors of Herat and other places on the frontier had been warned not to allow Russians to enter Afghanistan. It was also reported that the removal of all Jamshidi families in Badghis to the interior had been ordered. Further steps to deal with the Jamshidi raiders, including the despatch of six companies to the frontier, had been taken by the authorities at Herat.Telegraphing [No. 201] on 7th July,-the Viceroy said that there had been no improvement in the Bolshevik-Afghan relations on the Herat border.. ARABIA.The Hejaz Delegation and the Peace Treaty [F.C.R., xx, p. 3]. In reply to Lord Curzon&apos;s enquiry as to the inclusion of the clause proposed by the Hejaz delegation, Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 636] that the Council and the Minister of Wakfs, whom he had consulted, considered the clause inapplicable to Eg3*pt, inasmuch as the revenue from &quot; Wakfs of Haramain&quot; must remain entirely under the control of the Administrator, who could not divest himself of his power.Ibn Saud and King Hussein.r-Qi\ 2nd July [Nos. 600 and 601] Lord Curzon instructed Lord Allenby to inform King Hussein that the following -message had been sent to Ibn Saud : His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to inform you that King Hussein has agreed to meet you at Mecca as suggested by you in your letter of the 23rd May. They will be happy to attach a responsible Indian Moslem officer to accompany the Nejd pilgrims, but they do not now propose to despatch any official to arbitrate between you, as they feel sure that it is only necessary for you and King Hussein to meet and discuss matters face to face for the various points at issue between you to be amicably settled. They are arranging with King Hussein for supplies to be available at Mecca for the return journey of the Nejd pilgrims, and would be glad to be informed as soon as possible how many there are likely to be. You will no doubt realize that it is undesirable for any very large number of pilgrims to proceed from Nejd, and His Majesty&apos;s Government invite you to reduce the numbers as far as possible. They request, also, that you will give instructions that the number of armed men proceeding with the pilgrims should be reduced to the lowest possible limit. They would be glad of an early reply reassuring them on this point. They have informed King Hussein that this request has been made, and have represented to him that it is undesirable for him to allow any concentration of his own armed forces on the route which the pilgrims will follow. They earnestly trust that the meeting, which has been brought about through their auspices, will have a satisfactory result, and that it will prove instrumental in establishing peace between their two powerful Arab friends.On 8th July Lord Allenby reported [No.. 632] the . receipt of a telegram from King Hussein saying that he had expressly refused permission for the Nejd pilgrims to come by land; and, further, that he had only agreed to an escort of [? 300] men for Ibn Saud.Messages from King Hussein. On 3rd July Lord Allenby reported [No. 650] that he had received the following message from King Hussein, in reply to a message from himself, which had been communicated to His Majesty by the British Agent at Jeddah on 17th June : The war is finished, but the cause and object of the bond between Great Britain and Arabia are not finished, and will not finish owing to present and future circum-stances.   For this, and for the satisfaction which I felt at your Excellency&apos;s recent
declarations, in which you say that there is nothing to cause His Maj esty \s Government to withdraw from the promises they made, or to fail to co-operate amicably with me (which declarations I consider as a pledge upon which to rely), I hasten to state the following indictment: 1. I once again repeat that we have no connexion or relations with the Peace Conference.   Our relations are only with Great Britain.2. Your Excellency did not consider the question of my inability to manage the affairs of the country, which will be more difficult and complicated after the decision of the Conference to divide it. My recpiest to you to decide what steps should be taken is made to absolve myself of blame in case 1 withdraw forthwith.3. To protest against Great Britain is mean in my view, but your Excellency&apos;s declaration that &quot; there is nothing to cause,&quot; &amp;c, encourages me to ask you to con-si der the letters of the High Commissioner at Cairo, and especially one dated 10th March 1916. England has what concerns the honour of her glory in the contents of those letters, and will surely not ignore them.4. I beg of her greatness and chivalry to give us Mesopotamia, El-Ghezira, Syria and Palestine, in every way because the Arabs deserve Britain&apos;s sympathy&apos;- and pity. They were (and will continue to be) the only permanent means of preserving at very little cost all the interests she values.5. Had you relied on me and put me in the position for which I disposed myself, -and had you done according to the contents of the High Commissioner&apos;s letter of 24th October 1915, the rebellion of one (two groups undeeypherable) happen (group undecipherable) what may happen in the Near East and North Arabia would have happened [sic].I cannot refrain from saying that the opportunity is still in your hands.I pray your Excellency to consider the matter, as you are the sole person responsible for the result, the disadvantages of which are greater than the advan-tages.6. The physical form of El Hejaz is well known, as also are its moral and material conditions, and I honour and respect your decisions which have given it the title of &quot; a Power.&quot; These were my reasons for asking that it should be annexed to the rest of its country, and for stating the causes of my inability to manage it (group undecipherable) increased.Lord Allenby added that in para. 6 the King meant that the Hejaz was so barren and devoid of resources that it could not exist as a separate country.Two days later [Nos. 657 and 658] Lord Allenby sent the following message containing, he said, extracts from a telegram which he had just received from King Hussein : My confidence in Great Britain is (group omitted) by the fact that I have ignored the adverse criticism of Moslems in Turkey and elsewhere concerning my (group omitted) with her. I would lose my honour if I asked to withdraw in order to oppose her.Her fundamental reason in asking me to revolt was to renew the glory of the Arabs and to appease Moslem sentiment. As a result both Turkey and Arabs have perished.   What can I do but withdraw, if I do not commit suicide ?I will never oppose what is necessary for peace and the progress of the country, especially when there are thousands of pilgrims here. I asked two things for them in accordance with our agreement. First, help if internal trouble was brought about by the intrigues of enemies or the jealousy of certain Emirs. .Secondly, the monthly subsidy. Refusal of these has placed me in a critical position ; and I need not refer to the consequences of my fall at the present time, or to the stain on my future history if I remain, or to the contents of my letter of 18th April 1920.I suggested in our original agreement that Great Britain should occupy Basra only. This would safeguard the rights and honour of both parties. The same applies to Syria and Palestine. If the people are given their rights they will be your slaves for ever otherwise there will be hostility and hate.If there is another way to save me from my withdrawal and enable me to remain as you desire, please explain it and 1 will adopt it.Quarantine Officials at Jeddali [F.C.R., xx, p. 3.] Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 655] on 3rd July, that pending the arrival of Major Marshal no attempt to control the quarantine was being made. King Hussein, to whom he had proposed that-Major Marshal should act as British agent for a time, had sent a very friendly reply
-welcoming Major Marshall arrival, although not specifically accepting the proposal. Lorcl Allenby was hopeful of a satisfactory settlement.Telegraphing [No. 697] on 12th July, Lord Allenby reported that Major Marshal having arrived, had had -an interview with King Hussein,. who, however, had not altered his point of view. The King refused to allow Major Marshal to control the quarantine or to exercise any authority over the local doctors, although he&apos; had no objection to his submitting criticisms and recommendations for improvements. The King evidently regarded the question from a political and not a health point of view.Lord Allenby deprecated any attempt to insist on control, but considered it desirable that Major Marshal should remain during the pilgrimage, so as to be available in the event of an epidemic breaking out.ARGENTINA.Wheat Export Bill [E.G.R., xx, p. 3]. On 28th June Mr. Macleay telegraphed from Buenos Aires as follows [No. 134] :-In accordance with your Lordship&apos;s instructions I addressed, on 26th June, an urgent note to the Argentine Government and pressed for a prompt reply.I fear that the Argentine Government will never agree to exempt from the new duty all the wheat bought before 2nd June for the account of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment for shipment to the United Kingdom; but I think that if all the Governments concerned would take common action the Argentine Government might be compelled to exempt the cargoes of all ships which had received the usual licences to load and had deposited the existing export duties on 2nd June when loading was suspended by the legislative decree.The Argentine Government may be forced by the necessity of acquiring wheat for milling purposes to eventually accept the offer contained in para, 7 of your telegram, but I anticipate that they wiU not do so before they have exhausted all possible efforts to force down the market price and to reach a more&apos; favourable agreement with other parties, the average cost price of whose recent purchases has been considerably lower than ours.So far there have been no signs of prohibition of export, and loading is naturally proceeding at full speed. The Argentine Government is evidently in a serious dilemma.Telegraphing again on 1st July [No. 136] he said : The Minister for Foreign Affairs asked me to call last night at his private house and proceeded to express his surprise and regret at the tone of my note, which he considered unduly harsh. He had not submitted it to his Government and before doing so wished to ask me privately to withdraw or modify it. He appears to object especially to His Majesty&apos;s Government protesting against the surtax law and to their referring to the assistance given in the matter of the loan, when asking for exemption of their purchases made prior to 2nd June. He said that the Argentine Government had rendered much greater services and that in his reply he would be obliged to remind them of this fact. He was somewhat vague as to the exact nature of these services, but I understood him to refer to the original wheat loan and to the arrangement concluded with my predecessor when the Argentine Government loaned to His Majesty&apos;s Government a certain quantity of wheat.I replied that my note had been based on explicit instructions from your Lordship and that I certainly could not withdraw or modify it without your consent. I explained to his ExceUency the reasons why I considered His Majesty&apos;s Government were absolutely justified in recording their friendly protest against the law, and against the policy of the Argentine Government in making-foreign consumers pay the whole cost of the bread subsidy in their country. This led to a long argument in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs endeavoured to maintain that the law was not retrospective in its effect generally, to justify the action of his Government.I elicited from him the admission that the Argentine Government would not in any case agree to the exemption of such shipments as should have been loaded before 10th June.He enquired whether our offer to sell 200,000 tons of wheat at cost price was conditional on the exemption of our purchases from the surtax.   I replied in the
negative and said that the two things were distinct. He asked me the price and I replied on the authority of the Wheat Commission that the average price of contracts had been 26 dollars, but as these were free on board it would probably be possible to reduce the price by a dollar. Finally, I said that all I could do was to report what he had said to your Lordship ; but I held out no hope that you would withdraw or modify the note.The conclusion I reached is that the President and the Argentine Government, to whom the Minister for Foreign Affairs has certainly communicated the substance of my note, are afraid that the action taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government will lead to a succession of similar protests from the other Powers interested. Even if they wished to do so, they could not give us exemption without extending the concession to others similarly placed.I venture to suggest that your Lordship should authorize me to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs in reply to his private representations that His Majesty&apos;s Government, in referring to the financial assistance lately rendered to.the Argentine Government, did not mean to propose anything in the nature of a bargain or to claim exceptional treatment, but they consider for the reasons set out in the note that they were fully justified in recording their friendly but formal protest against the law of 10th June and its effects.In reply to Mr. Macleay&apos;s telegram of 28th June [No. 134J Lord Curzon instructed him [No. 70] that if the Argentine Government should decline the offer to sell to them 200,000 tons of our wheat at cost price, he unight offer to place this quantity at their disposal, provided they would agree (1) to place an equivalent quantity at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government not later than the loth February next, giving adequate notice in order that tonnage might be arranged; and (2) to pay interest, at a rate to be agreed, on the cost price of the wheat thus lent by us.If the main principle of the foregoing proved acceptable, the necessary details would be arranged as soon as possible.After the receipt of these instructions Mr. Macleay telegraphed on 3rd July [No. 137] saying : Pending the receipt of a reply to my telegram No. 136, and until we know definitely whether the Argentine Government will accept or decline His Majesty&apos;s Governments first offer, the Acting Wheat Commissioner desires to submit the following considerations with regard to your aiternative offer :  That whereas the average price of the last 200,000 tons, which it is suggested should be handed to the Argentine Government, cost approximately 26 dollars per 100 kilogrammes free on board at Buenos Aires, or the equivalent at other ports, the new crop of wheat for the February delivery has been sold at 18J paper dollars delivered in Buenos Aires ; and although no large volume of business could be done to-day for so distant a (? date) the few quantities dealt in show the relative values of spot and distant wheat, and-the new proposal to lend the Argentine Government ready wheat in exchange for February is so favourable to this Government that it amounts virtually to but a trifling modification of the Argentine Governments earlier expressed desire to fix the price approximately at 18 dollars on such quantity of ready wheat as they might require, If, therefore, an exchange is to be effected he suggests that the disparity in price should not be overlooked, but should be adjusted by a monetary payment.I concur in the view, that unless we receive some such compensation the alternative proposal is unduly favourable to the Argentine Government.The Acting Commissioner adds that the technical difficulties in the way of receiving large quantities of wheat from the Argentine Government are likely to be considerable.A week later he reported as follows [No. 141] : With regard to the sale offer, in the course of a long conversation, at which the Acting Wheat Commissioner was present, the Minister for Foreign Affairs enquired whether we could absolutely guarantee that the full 200,000 tons would be delivered if the Argentine Government took over our contracts. We explained that we had made the contracts in good faith with the leading wheat houses, and the proof that we expected them to deliver wheat was to be found in our chartering and despatching vessels to fetch it. Apart from this we had had an absolute guarantee that in no case would there be a shortage. The Minister for Foreign Affairs then said that the Argentine Government wished to deal with His 18-2 B
GMaj esty &apos;s Government, and not with the sellers, and he evidently expected that the Wheat Commission would undertake the immediate delivery of 200,000 tons. It was explained to him that the&quot; Commission could uot alter the conditions of the contracts or the dates of delivery and could not rmdertaketo act as receivers and intermediaries : between the sellers and the Argentine Government. I said that the offer of His Majesty&apos;s Government was to transfer their contracts for 200,000 tons to the Argentine Government at cost price, and that the latter would have to make arrangements them-selvesas to delivery.   I pressed for an early and definite reply.After.a Cabinet Council the Minister for Foreign Affairs sent for me and said that the Argentine Government, being anxious to ensure that sufficient wheat remained in thecountry to supply their own requirements for home consumption, had decided to issue a decree limiting further export to 500,000 tons. He thanked me for the offer of sale, but said that his Government felt they must be absolutely certain of getting the wheat (which they appeared to think they would not be if they accepted our proposal) and had therefore decided on the above-mentioned step.In the circumstances it seemed to me useless and undesirable to put forward the loan offer, although I had given the Minister for Foreign Affairs to understand that I had an alternative proposal.In their present mood, the Argentine Government are obviously not disposed . to give any compensation for the sacrifice we should make under the loan offer. They evidently hope that limited export followed by prohibition will bring down the price and enable them to purchase sufficient for their requirements at a lower price than that paid by His Majesty&apos;s Government and later purchasers. I doubt whether this anticipation will prove correct, and meanwhile we should be able to ship, before export is&apos; closed, the majority of the balance of our purchases over and above 200,000 tons.On the. same clay, 10th July, be also telegraphed [No. 142] the following-translation of the decree issued on Sth July : Article 1.- Counting from the present date, exportation is permitted up to a maximum of 500,000 tons in all of wheat or its equivalents in flour (? as well as) derivatives in accordance with the respective (sic) law.Article 2. Export will be determined by priority of  shipments up to that quantity.BULGARIA.Ownerless Lands. Telegraphing from Sofia on 9th July [No. 75] Sir Herbert Bering said that he had been officially informed that the Department of State Domains had taken possession, in the name of the State, of all ownerless lands within the confines of Bulgaria, i.e., &quot;those whose owners were unknown or who had fled the country during the war of 1877-78. All former Turkish State lands were considered to be now Bulgarian State lands. The Department was unaware that any such lands might have been the private property of the Sultan.THE CAUCASUS.Use of Ports and Railways.  On 1st July Lord Curzon sent Admiral de Robeck [No. 602] the following message for-Colonel Stokes :  iIn order to comply with that part of your instructions requiring you to secure from the Georgian Government the free use of Batum for certain States and free transit over the Caucasian Railway, including access to Batum, you should ask Georgia to comply with her undertakings on the lines of the following articles of the draft Ttu-kisk Beace Treaty ; namely, as regards the use of Batum, Articles 335 and 344 inclusive, and as regards the Caucasian Railway and access to Batum, Articles 351, 349 and 328, with substitution in Article 32S of &quot; States belonging to the League of -Nations &quot; for &quot; Allied Powers.&quot;Similar undertakings should be obtained mutatis mutandis from Armenia in respect of her railways and ports.The adherence of both States to any general convention on railways which may be adopted by the League of Nations should, if possible, be prescribed.   In any case t absolute equality of treatment should be guaranteed to all users of the railways, irrespective of the nationality of the passengers or of the origin or ownership of the goods.Any rights stipulated in favour of Azerbaijan should be prescribed as depending on similar undertakings being entered into for the Azerbaijan railways and Baku.
The foregoing gives effect to and  takes  the  place of  para.  10 of Mance&apos;smemorandum. . . v ,   ..Any disputes arising should be settled under the same &quot;procedure as laid down in Mance&apos;s para. 13, except that for any question re ports, in Armenia there should be two Armenian instead of two Georgian members of the International Commission.Para. 15 of Mance\s memorandum refers to Georgians obligations as a member of .the League of Nations ; this is erroneous, as Georgia is not yet a member of the League.CHINA.The Situation and Japan. Telegraphing [No. 266] from Tokio on 12th July, Mr. Alston sent the following Japanese view of the situation in China :  The Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that he considers the situation inChina critical, and that the most categorical instructions have been sent to all-Japanese officials, both military and civil, in China and Manchuria, to observe the strictest neutrality, and to refrain from encouraging any Chinese faction.GERMANY. )Bavaria and the Allied Demands. On 10th July Mr. Smallbones reported from Munich [No. 28] that the Bavarian Government had issued a statement in &quot;the Press to the effect that it had repeatedly made representations to the Central Government that the Einwohnerwehr and the Sicherheitswehr should in no circumstances be dispensed with in Bavaria, and that the Allied demands on this question should be refused : the news from Spa had not caused it to alter its attitude, and, taking up this jDOsition irrevocably, it would continue its efforts to maintain in Bavaria the protection which State and people absolutely required for their security.Appointment of a French Minister to Bavaria. Lord Kilmarnock telegraphed from Berlin on 10th. July [No. 113] that the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had informed him that the French Ambassador had. notified to the German Government the appointment of a French Minister, M. Darn, at Munich. The German Government did not consider that the constitution admitted of diplomatic rerjresentatives of foreign Powers being accredited to the Bavarian Government.HUNGARY.The Oreusot Firm and the Railways. -Telegraphing from Washington on 11th -July [No. 517], Sir Auckland Geddes reported that he had learnt from the Acting Secretary of State that he had been informed by the French Aanbassador that the Hungarian Government had, through Mr. Eugene Schneider, conceded the entire reorganization and re-equipment of the railways to the Oreusot firm, the . concession -carrying with it the control of the railways through technical commissions. On Mr. Davis enquiring whether the French would also take over the political control of transportation, the Ambassador replied that that would be unnecessary.ITALY.Vote on the Declaration of Policy. On 10th July Sir George Buchanan tele-graphed [No. 301] as follows : The Government yesterday obtained a majority of 119 in the .vote on their declaration of policy. The President of the Council made a short speech before the vote,&apos;in which he repeated the reasons for the principal legislative measures fore-shadowed in his speech at the re-opening of the Chamber.As regards foreign policy, he again stated his intention of asking Parliament to agree to the creation of Committees for Foreign Affairs. The Governments policy of independence for Albania was, he said, entirely spontaneous, and not due to any pressure arising out of the internal situation. The Government aimed at friendly relations with J ugo-Slavia, and he did not see why there should not be direct nego-tiations for the agreement, which was to the interest of that country, and would, he felt, confident, be reached once the Parliamentary Committees had reported on the various proposals. -He could not undertake to improvise the&apos;solution of the Fiume question, but the Government intended to follow the policy of promoting permanent peace. In reply to the Socialists, he denied having had any negotiations with De Ambris, D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s-Ohef de Cabinet.His speech was well received, and the voting was carried out quietly.
Albania. On 29th. June Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 282] that the President of the Council had announced in the Chamber that no more troops would be sent to Albania, and that a diplomat had proceeded thither with full powers superior to those of the military authorities, to negotiate in a friendly spirit with the Albanian Government, and to submit a proposal for a speedy and satisfactory peace. The diplomat in question was Baron Alliotti, late High Commissioner at Sofia.Telegraphing again on 9th July [No. 295] he further reported that Baron Alliotti had had an interview with the Albanian Government at Tirana, but so far had not been, able to come to any arrangement. The Albanians were clearing the civil administration of Valona. The Italian prisoners at Santi Quaranta were to be withdrawn shortly when the stores were removed. There had. been no fighting during the past week.Mutiny at Brindisi.  On 1st July Sir George Buchanan telegraphed [No. 286] that a mutiny had occurred at Brindisi on 3(Jth June amongst a company of the Arditti under orders for Valona. After 40 men had been embarked, firing broke out on the quay and the ship sailed with only those 40 on board.This incident, together with the mutiny at Ancona, pointed to the fact that the army, although loyal as far as service in Italy was concerned, was not altogether to be trusted for service out of Italy. The Military Attache asked that the War Office might be informed.Tripoli. On 9th July Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 295] that the situation in Tripoli was improving.   Colonel Citarella, late Commandant at Horns, had been released, but the garrison of Sirt were still held prisoners.   The Italians hoped that they would soon be able to arrange matters with Ramadan Stewi.   The Governor of&quot; Tripoli, Mentzinger, had been replaced.Inter-Allied Purchases of Breadstuff s. The following telegram [No. 291] was sent by Lord Curzon to Sir George Buchanan on 5th July :  With reference to the memorandum handed by Signor Nitti to the Prime Minister on 27th April at San Renio, very careful consideration has been given by the Govern-ment to the suggestion that the Inter-Allied purchasing organization should not only be maintained, but should in future be extended to other European nations, who should be called upon to participate in it.After full examination of the circumstances, the Government has decided that it cannot accede to the proposition. We believe that the best road to economic recon-struction is to revert as quickly as possible to normal commercial enterprise, and to the reduction of State control. We therefore feel that we cannot agree to the proposal that the Consultative Food Committee should be prolonged beyond the 31st August next, when it terminates according to the existing agreement; still less would it be possible to agree to its extension by the addition of other European Powers.PERSIA.The Shah and His Prime Minister [F.C.R., xx, p. 10].--Referring to numerous telegrams received from Mr. Norman at Teheran, Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 352j on 1st july , that he regarded the entrance into power of Mushir-ed-Dowleh with some misgiving on account of the mediocre capacity of the individuals whom he proposed to include in his Cabinet. In conjunction with this, Mushir-ed-Dowleh s own character caused some doubt as to the passing of the Anglo-Persian Agreement through the Mejliss. With regard to the terms on which our support could be given, Mr. Norman was informed that there were certain payments which could not be entertained. These included the monthly allowance to the Shah, which was made contingent upon the retention in power of Vossuk-ed-Dowleh ;* the expenses incurred by the Shah in Europe ; and the monthly subsidy to the Cossack division. The utmost that could be -assented to was the monthly subsidy of tomans 350,000 for a period of four months, &apos; and this only on the condition that the Mejliss was summoned and its consent to the Anglo-Persian Agreement sought within that period. Mr. Norman was authorized to speak in this sense to Mushir-ed-Dowleh. While His Majesty&apos;s Government were by no means desirous of deserting the line of policy consistently pursued towards Persia during the administration of the late Prime Minister, some guarantees of reciprocal loyalty and good faith were required to be displayed by the incoming Persian Govern-ment should an entirely different regime be contemplated.On the same day Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 449] that he had received information that Mushir-ed-Dowleh, acting on the advice of the Shah, had definitely^
declined to form a Government, on the ground that the absence of a communication, regarding Persian demands from His Majesty&apos;s Government indicated a lack of confidence in the new Cabinet.In a later telegram [No. 450] on 1st July Mr. Norman reported that he had persuaded Mushir-ed-Dowleh to reserve his final decision for a few days pending the receipt of a reply to his demands. The latter had stated that the Shah had not counselled him to give up the attempt to form a Cabinet, but had merely acquiesced in his declining to do so.On 3rd July Mr. Norman reported [No. 453] that he had communicated the sense of Lord Curzon&apos;s telegram [No. 352] to Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who had professed ignorance of the monthly allowance paid to the Shah, and of his demand for re-imbursement of his expenses in Europe. Mr. Norman expressed his regret at the decision to discontinue the allowance, as it would remove one of the chief inducements to the Shah to give his support to the incoming Cabinet, which Mr. Norman thought would be able to render greater service to ourselves and to Persia than its predecessor. Mushir-edrDowleh had accepted the conditions regarding the continuation of the subsidy7 for four months, and had given his assurance that his Government would summon Parliament, and do their best to secure the acceptance of the Anglo-Persian agreement.Reverting to the subject of the monthly allowance to the Shah, Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 460] on 6th July7 his increasing regret at the decision to discontinue it, and begged for authority to inform the Shah.th.at payment would, continue for the present, but that financial considerations might compel His Majesty7&apos;s Government to stop it later on, independently of the nature of the Persian Government in power at the time.In reply7 to the foregoing, Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 37] from Spa on 10th July that he could not ask His Majesty&apos;? Government to agree to the continuance of the allowance to the Shah. Apart from the fact that the allowance had been made strictly on the conditions that Vossuk-ecl-DowIeh would be retained and supported, Lord Curzon considered it an unsound policy7 to pay a sovereign of an independent State, with whom we w7ere in close relations, for his loyalty to our interests or to an agreement between the respective Governments.POLAND.Council of National Defence. On 1st July7 Sir Horace Rumbold reported [no number] that the Prime Minister had that day, in the Diet, made the following statement with reference to the war against the Bolsheviks : For the first time our whole nation stands in great danger and must realize its responsibility. The time has come to prove the nation&apos;s strength. The first duty7 is the defence of the State, but the Government is also making every endeavour to bring-about an honourable peace. The responsibility7 of carrying on the war or making-peace is, however, so great that it cannot he taken by one person. Something must be formed which must have great elasticity in order that decisions may be made quickly and easily7. The Prime Minister, by7 order of the Chief of the State, proposes to create a Council of Defence of the State which will be composed of the following members :  the Chief of the State, the Prime Minister, the Ministers, the Marshal of the Diet, five military7 persons of high rank who will be chosen by the Chief of the State,: ten deputies. This Council will have the final decision in all questions concerning the conduct of the war or making peace.On 6th July he further reported [No. 480] that the new Council of National Defence had issued a proclamation to the soldiers of the Polish Republic announcing its formation and its representative character of ah classes in the Polish nation, and, explaining the need for its institution. The proclamation made a stirring appeal for a supreme effort against the national enemy, which was not Russia, but Bolshevism,, with its ty7ranny7, cruelty7 and economic ruin; it also pointed out that the whole future freedom and greatness of Boland depended on the issue of the present struggle and the absolute need of victory to avert disaster, and expressed the confidence . of the, country in the army and its determination to care for the next of kin. 18-2 C
Appeal to the Supreme Council.-On 7th July Sir Horace &quot;Rumbold telegraphed &quot;[No. 488] the following translation of a note addressed to the President of the Supreme Council by the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs :  xIn the name of the Polish Government I have the honour to bring the following to the notice of the Supreme Council:- -Poland is at this moment engaged in a supreme struggle to preserve her existence. The aim of the Polish nation in this struggle is to assure its independence and to.obtain a just and durable peace, which would guarantee to it the territories inhabited by Poles wdio desire to be united with their nation.I have the honour to inform your Excellency that a peace in accordance with conditions which are just and based on the law of nations, a peace which would permit the inhabitants of the territories situated between Poland and Russia to &quot;determine their own fate, would be immediately accepted by the Polish - Government and nation.The Polish Government considers, however, that in this struggle we are not defending merely the rights of the Polish people ; our soldiers, worn out by fatigue and overwhelmed by an enemy superior in numbers, form the living rampart which protects the whole of Europe from the Bolshevik flood.In this character of the defender of the households of civilization it is our duty to warn our Allies of the imminent danger which would threaten Europe in the event of the Polish army succumbing to the enemy.It is our duty to warn the Supreme Council of this state of affairs, in order to enable it to make in time the decisions, whose postponement might have disastrous consequences, not only for us but for the Allies themselves.The whole Polish nation, rallying for a supreme effort, is rising in defence of its home.If events compel Poland to continue the struggle, the moral and material aid of the Allies, without which she would be unable to accomplish her task, would be indispensable to her.The Polish Government asks urgently for immediate and efficacious aid, and does not doubt that her appeal will be listened to. Whatever may be the measures which the Supreme Council may think it necessary, to take at this decisive moment, the Polish nation will be willing to accept them, remaining faithful to its duty towards it and towards the Allies.In another telegram [No. 492] sent on the same clay, Sir Horace said that this note was drafted by Prince Sapieha and M, Daszynski, the Socialist leader who would have been Foreign Minister in a Witos Cabinet, He had heard this from the French Legation.Appeal to the Allied Parliaments. On 7th July Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 486] that at the sitting of the Diet on 6th July it was decided to send an appeal to the Parliaments of the allied countries requesting them to bring pressure to bear on their respective Governments with a view to postponing the date of the plebiscites until such time as the Polish nation was at peace and in a position to make the necessary preparations for them.Charges against the Polish Army. On 30th June Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 457] that the following communique had been issued by the Polish General Staff: In view of the fact that the Bolsheviks have been lately spreading false news to the effect that the Polish troops on leaving Kieff blew up the cathedrals of St. Sofia and St. Vladimir, and the electric power station, and also several buildings of public utility, it is hereby categorically declared that this is devoid of foundation. Our troops on leaving Kieff only blew up the bridges on the Dnieper. Units of our troops who had.entered Kieff found the electric plant station and waterworks out of action owing to the ruinous administration of the Bolsheviks during their stay. Our troops restarted the waterworks and began repairing the power station, and these two establishments were left to the Bolsheviks in a better condition than they were found by the Polish troops. The churches remained untouched by-the Polish troops, but were damaged by three shells of the Bolshevik heavy artillery. The. blowing up of the bridges was necessary for strategic considerations, and also to enable thousands of the civil population to leave Kieff before the return of the extraordinary Soviet Commission for combating counter-revolution.
RUSSIA.Message from M. Chicherin. On 7th July the following wireless message was sent hy M. Chicherin :  Complying with the desire of the British Government in the purpose to arrive at an early peace between Russia and Great Britain, the Russian Soviet Government accepts the principles laid down in the memorandum transmitted on 1st July by the British Government to the President of the Russian Delegation, M. Krassin ; an agreement between Russia and Great Britain which will be the object of negotiations that have to begin without delay. The Soviet Government agrees that the plan proposed by the British Government will have to be considered a state of armistice between Russia and Great Britain, and shares its expectation that this armistice will pave the way to a definite peace, whilst at the same time protesting against the affirmation contrary to the real facts relative to the presumed attack of the Soviet Government, realizes once more that as Soviet Russia in her relations with Great Britain desires nothing but peace, and that the absence of the same disposition on the other side was the only cause preventing it from being as yet attained.Ukraina.Economic Conditions [P.C.R., xix, p. 15]. On 28th June Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed from Warsaw [No. 448] that Lieut.-Commander Rawlings had positive information from the head of the Ukrainan Co-operatives, who had just returned from Kieff, that the amount of wheat hoarded by peasants in Ukraina and available for export in return for (1) agricultural machinery and implements of all sorts (needed before everything else); (2) stock for breeding purposes^ (3) colonial produce, tea, &amp;c. ; (4) clothing and boots; (5) hardware and ironmongery; (6) railway material and metals, was 10,000,000 tons without counting this year s crop. He added that the Co-operatives were completely hostile to Bolshevism, and strongly nationalist.In reply Lord Curzon asked [No. 293] whether Sir Horace could obtain any data supporting the figure of 10,000,000 tons for the wheat available for export from Ukraina, also whether there was any confirmatory evidence of the existence of such enormous stocks from other sources than the Ukrainan. Co-operatives.On receipt of this Sir Horace telegraphed again [No. 470] saying that the Head of the Department for trade with Ukraina was of opinion that the figure of 10,000,000 tons might not. be exaggerated, as it was understood that during 1917, 1918, and 1919 practically no corn was exported from Ukraina, either abroad or to other parts of the former Russian Empire.The Department was, however, unable to obtain exact statistics, as the corn was exclusively in the hands of the peasants and mostly unthrashed. The above figure would refer to the whole of Ukraina, and not only to those ports which  had been temporarily occupied by the Boles and Ukrainan troops.Sir Horace added that he had heard from the same source that the stocks of sugar were believed to be 70,000 tons, of which a half wras in factories and the rest scattered amongst the peasants (who refused to work on beet plants unless they were paid in sugar) and the small merchants.It would, he said, in any case have been difficult to obtain corroborative evidence of the figures given by the Ukrainan Co-operatives but it had now become impossible owing to the retreat of the Polish troops from Ukraina ; he doubted, therefore, whether he should be able to get further information on the subject.Siberia.Red Military Terror. Telegraphing from Peking on 28th June [No. 308], Mr. Alston said that His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Harbin had received information from three separate sources that there was a marked revival of the Red military terror in Western Siberia. Also that the British prisoners at Irkutsk (19, of whom 15 were military) were kept under a strong guard in a fourth-class car, and were only allowed half a pound of bread a day ; and that additional food could only be obtained by-selling cheques. Mr. Alston added that Captain Stilling, who was previously with the British Military Mission in Siberia, was leaving for Harbin with supplies for British use.

SERBIA.Albania. The following note was communicated on 23rd June by the Serb-Croat-Slovene Minister :--L&apos;Envpye extraordinaire et Ministre plenipotentiaire du Royaume des Serbes, Groates et Slovenes presente ses compliments a son Excellence Earl Curzon of Kedleston et a 1&apos;honneur de porter a sa connaissance qu&apos;il vient de recevoir de son Gouvernement la communication suivante :&quot; D&apos;apres les informations parvenues an Gouvernement Royal, les Italiens auraient 1&apos;intention d&apos;entreprendre en Albanie une action de grande envergure.

On 13th July Lord Allenby reported [No. 703] the receipt of the following message from Emir Feisal:- The French are concentrating at Jerus to attach Aleppo with guns, aeroplanes and tanks. They demand military occupation of all stations from Ryak to Aleppo, unconditional acceptance of the French mandate and of French Syrian money in the Eastern zone. They state that I may not leave for Europe before accepting these terms. I request that prompt representations may be made as the French are moving rapidly.UNITED STATES  OF  AMERICA.The Democratic Nomination. On 7th July Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed as follows [No. 507] from Washington . The nomination of Governor Cox of Ohio is a real victory for the anti-Wilson sections of the Democratic party, and was absolutely unexpected at the White House. It was brought about by the solid and dogged support he received from the Tammany Bosses. , CoXj though not a Wilson man, is generally in favour of a League of Nations, not necessarily the League, though he himself would accept it as it stands with the two following reservations drafted by himself : I. In giving its assent to this treaty the Senate has in mind the fact that the League of Nations which it embodies was devised for the sole purpose of maintaining peace and comity among the nations of the world, and&apos; preventing the recurrence of such destructive calamities as that through which it has just passed. The co-operation of the United States with the League, and its continuance as a member thereof, will naturally depend upon the adherence of. the League to that fundamental purpose.2. It will of course be understood that in carrying out the purpose of the League the United States Government must at all times act in strict harmony with the terms and intention of the United States constitution, which cannot in any way be altered by the treaty-making Power.I can find no short statement by Governor Cox himself embodying his views on * self-determination, but he is on record as strongly in favour of it; though I know of no encouragement of the idea by himself, this is read by the Irish as being specially appreciable to their own aspirations. Some of our southern friends say that he is a Sinn Feiner, but there is no evidence of this beyond the presumption that the Irish have not supported him in five elections for nothing.He is on record as proposing to support foreign trade and is generally sympathetic to labour.The nomination of Franklin Roosevelt is in accordance with the original rjlans of the administration, which were based as much on his being a New Yorker as on other considerations. He is well known in England and is thoroughly friendly. In conversation a few days ago he expressed,&apos;! believe honestly and sincerely, his conviction of the necessity for Anglo-American co-operation.
