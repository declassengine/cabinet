FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Instigation of Border Unrest. The Viceroy of India telegraphed [6140] on 15th. May that reports had come in that Nadir Khan had sent messengers to the Mohmand and Bajaur tribes warning them to prepare for jehad. The same individual had also prepared Caliphate leaflets in Jalalabad for distribution among the tribes on the North-West Frontier. A report had been received that Nasrulla had been murdered, in Cabul, but this Avas unconfirmed.ARABIA.Dutcli Recognition of King Hussein. On 11th May Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 474] that the Dutch Consul-General had informed him some weeks ago that his GoA^ernment had recognized the King of Hejaz and that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been notified.Lord AUenby further said that King Hussein had officially recognized Mr. Gobee as Dutch Consul, and that he had been informed that there AA-as no question of sending another Dutch representative:ARMENIA.Reported Negotiations witli the Soviet Government. On 10th May Admiral Webb reported [No. 560] that he had telegraphed to Commander Luke at Tiflis enquiring whether he had any Confirmation of a report that negotiations Avere in progress between the Dashnak party at Erivan and the Soviet Government on the basis that the latter Avould help Armenia to obtain the provinces of Van and Erzerum Avith part of that of Bitlis and a Black Sea port, in &apos; exchange for Armenia placing her foreign affairs under their control.In reply Commander. Luke informed the High Commissioner on 12th May [No. 242] that his only information Aras that, at the imitation of the Soviet, the Armenian Government had sent three delegates to VlachkaAdias to enter into pourparlers on the basis of a recognition of Armenia&apos;s independence and right to manage her internal affairs. So far he had heard of no negotiations taking place at Erivan with the Dashnak party.BALTIC STATES.Finland and the Soviet Government. Telegraphing from Helsingfors on 14th May [No. 463], Mr. Kidston said that the Acting-Minister for Foreign Affairs had communicated to him the text of a telegram dated 11th May, in which the Soviet Government invited the Finnish GoA^ernment formally to enter into pourparlers for the conclusion of a treaty of peace. Telegraphing again on the folkuving clay [No. 464], Mr. Kidston reported that the Finnish Government had consented to enter into pourparlers for peace with the SoAnet Government, stating that they would, shortly make proposals as to time and place.Latvia and the Soviet Government. -On 12th May Mr. Tallents telegraphed [No. 190] from Riga that &quot;the Lettish Ministry for Foreign Affairs had informed him that the Bolsheviks had submitted new demands, based on the Polish offensive, to their Delegation in Moscow. They demanded (? group omitted) terminable two months notice, and the unqualified neutrality of Latvia in their Avar with Poland. The Letts had offered local neutrality, which would include, for example, port facilities.BELGIUM. The Spa Conference. See under &quot; Germany.&quot;
THE CAUCASUS.General Situation. On 13th May Admiral Webb telegraphed from Constantinople [No. 582] the following message from the Italian representative at Tiflis, which had been communicated to him : Communication with Azerbaijan has been completely interrupted. The 1st May passed quietly at Tiflis, Batoum, and Erivan without any serious incident. At Tiflis some attempts at terrorism by the Bolsheviks were put down. Quiet prevails on the frontiers of Georgia, except for a few incursions by Bolshevik bands through the mountainous passes of the Caucasus.With British authorization, Georgian troops have assumed the protection of the railway line as far as Cobuteti, and have occupied Artvin.In the district of (word omitted) the Cossacks (word omitted) have capitulated. According to news circulating, it appears that the armistice between General Wrangel and the Soviet has been concluded through British mediation.Trustworthy reports note the successes of Maklmo and Petlura and of the Poles against the Bolsheviks, who are reported to have been obliged to withdraw their troops.The situation - in Armenia is very serious as a result of the conduct of the Bolshevik Moslems, the threat of a Turko-Tartar-Sovyist (sic) offensive, and of the lack of military resources.The&apos; unexpected exodus and departure of the American Mission, causing a; stoppage of all the invaluable services rendered by it, has produced in the last few clays a very unfortunate impression in the country.The Georgian Government claims to possess three years&apos; reserve of liquid fuel, winch will be recpusitioned by the State in future.In general the situation is uncertain.   Several requests for passports for abroad-are noted and for passages on ships.Baku. Telegraphing from Teheran on lltli May [No. 261], Sir Percy Cox reported that Sultan Kazim Khan, a member of the Persian Commission in the Caucasus, and a reliable intelligence officer, left Baku on 8th May for Astara in order to get into telegraphic communication with the Persian Government, and had that day, 11th May, sent the following news :  Khalil Pasha had just left Baku somewhat hurriedly for Moscow accompanied by Dr. Fuad.   The Turkish officer Rafaat Bey was Town Commandant.All foreign Missions, except that of Persia, had been arrested and were not being well treated.   The goods of all foreigners and local merchants were being&apos; commandeered, except those of Persians, who, however, were obliged to sell at prices -fixed by the Government.The 32nd and 11th armies from Petrovsk, stated by Kazim Khan to be about 60,000 strong, were said to be in and around Peki. Members of the Persian Commission remaining in Baku had called on the Bolshevik representatives on their arriAral and were well received, and some Persian merchandise which was under detention, including some motor cars, had since been released. The Commissariats said that they were anxious to enter into relations with the Persian Government, but it must be one based on Soviet principles. They were anxious also-to free Persia from the English, but for the moment they would probably not send, troops there.Georgia. On 10th May [Nos. 238 and 239, received 18th May] Commander Luke-reported the signing of an agreement with the Soviet Government, The Soviet had apparently renounced the Brest-Litovsk treaty as it affected Georgia and recognized the province of Batum as Georgian. The authorities were sceptical and regarded the peace as primarily intended to gain time; but the public were elated at the recogni-tion of their independence and Tiflis was beflagged.Sharp encounters with the Azerbaijan forces continued, but the Azerbaijan -Soviet had that day invited the Georgian Government to open pourparlers On 12th May.On 17th May Admiral de Rebeck reported [No. 598] that information had been, received from Batum that the Georgians had removed all fuel and rolling stock from, that place, had suspended the train services between it and Georgia, and had also stopped telegraphic communication. We might, he said, at any moment find our-selves in a state of Avar, as these acts taken in conjunction with the recent agreement with the Soviet Government raised serious misgivings as to Georgian intentions.
CHINA.Shantung.  On 8th May Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed [No. 170] that he had been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Japanese Government had addressed two notes to the Chinese Government about Shantung, but that no answer had been received, and according to information from Peking none was to be expected. In these circumstances the Japanese Government did not see what it could do except maintain the status quo ante.CZECHO-SLO slovakia.Elections for the Senate. -On 4th May Sir George Clerk reported [No. 85] that the elections for the Senate were complete, with the exception of eight seats reserved for the plebiscite area and the Ruthene territory, and gave the following results : Czech Social Democrats 41, German Social Democrats 16, Czech Clericals 18r Agrarians 14, National Socialists 10, Combined German Bourgeois Party 8, Slovak Agrarians 6, German Agrarians 6, German Christian Socialists 4, German Liberals 3, Czech Traders 3, combined German and Magyar Christian Socialists 2, Magyar Agrarian 1.Relations with the Soviet Government. On 10th May Sir George Clerk telegraphed [No. 86] the gist of the repty of the Czecho-Slovak Government to a note received from M. Chicherin. The Czecho-Slovak Government had, he said, accepted the basis offered for direct negotiation, and declared its readiness to send a commission to-Russia immediately, with full powers.GERMANY.Food for Dantzic. Lord Derby telegraphed [No. 564] from Paris on 11th May that Sir R, Tower had told him that if Dantzic were financially in a position to-obtain foodstuffs on a commercial basis, she would have no difficulty in arranging to do so, and the intervention of the Conference would be superfluous. The only question was, therefore, whether any of the Allied Powers were prepared to give supplies on a relief basis, and Lord Derby felt perfectly certain that unless His Majesty&apos;s Government took the lead, none of the other Powers would do so. He asked if some small portion of the relief credits authorized for Poland could not be applied to the relief of Dantzic through which town all the supplies sent to Poland were actually passing, and whose need wrould appear to be as great as that of Poland herself.Relations loith the Vatican. On 15th May, Lord Kilmarnock reported [No. 287] from Berlin that a note from the Cardinal Secretary of State had been published that day stating that&apos;in return for the establishment by Germany of an Embassy at the Vatican, in place of the former Prussian Legation, the Pope had decided to send a representative to Berlin, with the title and rank of Apostolic Nuncio. The former Nuncio at Munich, Monsignor Pacelli, had been appointed to the post, The agree-in ent of the German Government was asked for.The Spa Conference. In a telegram [No. 166] from Pome, dated 11th May, Sir George Buchanan stated that the Italian Government had communicated to him the note received by Signor Nitti from Herr Muller of 2nd May, notifying the acceptance of the invitation to the Spa Conference on 25th May. The note added that in the conviction that it would succeed in meeting the reproach of having failed to carry out certain peace conditions, the German Government reserved discussion of the questions raised until the meeting. It felt, however, compelled to point out that neither the modern law of nations nor the Peace Treaty would give the Allied Governments the right of occupying further portions of German territory. The German Government would present to the Conference the desired explanations and proposals and would, for its part, make every effort to reach a satisfactory solution in all respects.&apos; On 17th May Lord Curzon telegraphed, to the British Ambassadors at Rome  No. 218] and Brussels [No. 98] the following text of the message agreed upon by the-
Prime Minister and M. Millerand, which, subject to the concurrence of the Italian and Belgian Governments, it was proposed to address to the German Government: The attention of the Allied Governments has been drawn to the fact that the German national elections are due to take place on 6th June. The primary purpose of the Spa Conference is to enable the heads of the Allied Governments to examine with the responsible heads of the German Government the serious questions raised Try the failure of Germany to fulfil the solemn obligations which she assumed when her representatives signed and ratified the Treaty of Versailles, and also arrangements for securing its future execution. It. is of the utmost importance that once this Conference assembles it should not be distracted or delayed by external pre-occupa-tions. The Allied Governments, therefore, consider that the Conference to examine the &apos; execution of the Treaty of Versailles as proposed by them in their letter of 27th April and accepted by the German Government should be postponed until Monday, 21st June&quot;. They would be glad to learn if the German Government consents to this.GREECE.The Occupation of Thrace. From Athens, on 12th May, Lord Granville reported [No. 116] that the order said to have been issued by General Franchey for the concentration of all French troops in Thrace, in the vicinity of Constantinople, thereby giving uncontrolled possession of Thrace to the Turks, had greatly7 perturbed the Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. Venezelos had told him that he could not appeal to the Allies, as he had been told clearly that the Greeks could expect no assistance in the matter of occupation. Nevertheless the Minister was of opinion that the French should continue to Occupy the country until the Greeks were prepared to take it over.On 14th May Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 119] that the Greek Government had received a communication from the French Government announcing the immediate evacuation by French troops of Western Thrace and Ooritza, and that the Allies agreed to Greek occupation of these districts forthwith.Lord Granville reported that this decision had greatly pleased M. Venezelos, who believed that the evacuation of Western Thrace would mean an accession of French troops, if only temporary, in Eastern Thrace. M. Venezelos was confident that no regrettable incidents would attend the occupation of Western Thrace by the Greeks, and that, in consequence, the Allies would be disposed to authorize an early occupation of Eastern Thrace.HUNGARY.Inter-Allied Mission. Mr. Hohler, telegraphing [No. 272] from Budapest on 5th May, sent the following information: The Inter-Allied Mission, which was accompanied by the Serbian delegate, has now returned from a tour of inspection, as the result of which they report that not only has no concentration of troops at or towards the frontier taken place, but that the actual number of troops which they7 showed last month, has been reduced by7 two battalions, which have come to Budapest, and that there has been a partial demobilization of the gendarmerie reserve.Signing the Peace Treaty. On 7th May Mr. Hohler, reporting [No. 275] on the attitude of the public, sent the following : Unofficial, therefore, unauthentic, versions of letters covering the Peace Treaty have appeared in the Press, and have caused a deep impression of disappointment, as the Hungarian people had not ceased hoping that some opening would be left for the eventuality7 of modification of those conditions which appear to them impossible, for practical or other reasons, of acceptance ; a hope which they regard, in the light of these versions, as cancelled. A. phrase is given in a letter concerning the retention of territories, &quot; Children of a thousand years&apos; injustice,&quot; which has especially7 roused the popular feeling. A public meeting of protest, and in favour of a refusal to sign, was improvised yesterday and not numerously attended, although I am informed that signs of feeling were deep. The Government had taken most adequate measures to prevent anything in the nature of excesses, and all passed quietly7, although there were anti-semitic manifestations.The official Note is expected every7 minute. I feel convinced that the facts of the -case are that the Government is to sign the Treaty provided that the Note gives any7 hope of ulterior modification.16-3 B
ITALY.Negotiations with Serbia. -On 7th May Sir George Buchanan telegraphed from Rome [No. 159] as follows: In speaking to me this morning of &quot;the approaching negotiations the Assistant-Minister for Foreign Affairs said that if they failed the Italian Government would make no further attempt to come to a direct understanding with the Jugo-Slavs. However, in view of the conciliatory disposition of both Govern-ments, he hoped that an agreement would he reached on the following basis : Recognition of Italian sovereignty over the town of Fiume; renunciation by Italy of her claim to the corridor that was to connect the Italian territory with Fiume ; and the internationalization of the port. In order to be able to maintain contact with Fiume by sea, Italy was most anxious to -acquire the island of Gherso where all the towns were Italian while the countryside was Slav. The question of the possession, of this island would constitute the crux of the negotiations.[See &quot; Serbia.&quot;]The Spa Conference.- See above under &quot;Germany.&quot;JAPAN.Arms Traffic Convention. On 15th May Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed [No. 181] the following summary of a note received from the Japanese Government in reply to points raised in various communications from Lord Curzon.The Japanese Government see no objection to regarding aircraft as free from the restrictions imposed by the Arms Traffic Convention under the conditions specified.They acquiesce in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to their contract for the sale of arms to the Kolchak Government &quot; interpreted in the sense that all contracts for the sale of arms prior not only to the signature, but even to the ratification, are unrestricted by that Convention.&quot;With regard to the suggestion that the Convention should not be held to (? prevent) the sale of arms to Governments actually engaged in fighting the forces of disorder and supported politically by the Allied and Associated Governments, the Japanese Government desire that there should be no objection to the supply of arms outside the zones prohibited by Article 6, except where a specially prohibited sale has been agreed upon, to Governments for whom political and military support is deemed necessary, or to bodies falling within that category even without their necessarily receiving support from the Allied and Associated Governments, so long as the principle and spirit of the Convention are not infringed.They consider that even if effect were given to the proposal to restrict, for the present, the application of the Convention to small-bore arms, &amp;c, it wrould not be sufficient guarantee of the position of equality to private manufacturers so long as the United States and other chief signatories do not undertake to (? prevent) their manufacturers from exporting these categories of arms to civilized countries outside the prohibited zones. They accordingly suggest that the proposal should apply for the present only to prohibited zones as defined by the Convention, and that the prohibition of private transactions in arms between all other countries shoidd only become effective after the ratification of the Convention.MEXICO.Presidential Election. On 16th May Sir Auckland Geddes transmitted [No. 362] from New York a message received from Mexico to the effect that an extraordinary session of Congress had been called for 24th May, and that it was the intention to hold the presidential elections in July in accordance wdth the constitutional (group undecypherable).PALESTINE AND SYRIA.Emir Feisal and the Zionists.  On 13th May Lord Allenby transmitted [No. 470] the text of a communication received from Emir Feisal : It is with great appreciation that put on record the recognition of the Conference at San Remo that Syria and Mesopotamia are both independent. States.   This decision
of the Conference has been arrived at, as all the.Arabs believe, in accord with the desire of the independent Syrian nation and in a spirit of justice and humanity.Also I put on record with great justness the preparedness of our great ally, Great Britain, to recognize me as head of the independent Syrian State.As regards the mandate which your Lordship has mentioned, I feel I have no right to discuss it ; the people, being aware of the danger which it may entail upon their future safety and independence, have bitterly protested against it and refuse to accept it.Yet, that does not mean that we are self-contented and are not ready to get the necessary- help we are in need of by making contracts with  our allies in which our national sovereignty is absolutely safeguarded. In former letters both I and my Government have stated that we do not refuse such help.As regards the question of Palestine I have not noticed in your Lordship&apos;s letter enough clearness to suggest the recognition that this country is an inseparable part of Syria ; though Palestine geographically, ethnographic-ally, traditionally, economically, and from the point of view of language and national desire can in no way be separated from Syria. Moreover, there is to be found amongst the correspondence between His Majesty Hussein and His Excellency Sir H. MacMahon a letter in the name of Great Britain, dated 25th October 1915, which recognized Palestine to be within the Arab Empire whose limits as therein defined are accepted by the British Government.Moreover, these letters, as notes of meeting at 10, Downing Street, show, are considered to be of equal value&quot; as an engagement with the President of the French Republic. Even the Sykes-Picot agreement, on considering the question of Palestine, has clearly stated in the third Article that in the yellow zone an international administration would be established, and that the form of such an administration should be decided on after an agreement of representatives of the Sheriff at Mecca,There is nothing to be found in this document concerning Zionists or Jews. Being in need of calming people who are in a most agitated state of mind and spirit, I hope I can get from Great Britain some satisfactory declaration which I can also use in keeping in the hearts of Arabs the confidence which they have in their great ally and prove to them that any agreement between the British and the Zionists is in no way to be considered of more value than the agreement with King Hussein or the President of the French Republic.As regards the question of my acquiescence to the creation of a national home for Jews in Palestine, I believe there is some misunderstanding; all that I have admitted is to safeguard the rights of the Jews in that country as much as the rights of the indigenous Arab inhabitants are safeguarded and to allow the same rights and privileges.The Arabs of Palestine, both Christian and Mohameclan, have repeatedly availed themselves of every opportunity against any agreement or pledge that they would make their motherland the national home of the Israelites. I am ready to come to Europe quickly to state the case of my country If only I receive a positive declaration to my agitated people stating that-the Conference does in no way allow Palestine to be separated from Syria. By such means alone I believe we can come to a solution which would safeguard the interests of all concerned. In the meantime I am urgently in need of an answer.I again wish to assure your Lordship of my high consideration and esteem.The Jews and the Mandate. On 10th May Lord Allenby reported [No. 462] that a joint delegation representing the Jewish communities of Cairo and Alexandria had called on him to express their gratitude to His Majesty s Government for creating in Palestine a national home for the Jews and for accepting the mandate for that -country-.Two days later he further reported [No. 469] that the Grand Rabbi of Palestine had asked him to convey7&quot; to His Majesty the satisfaction of himself and the orthodox Jews of Palestine at the acceptance of the mandate by Great Britain.On the same day, 12th&apos; May, the following message from His Majesty7 the King-was telegraphed [No. 442] to Lord Allenby7 for transmission to Chief Rabbi Kuk at Jerusalem : I have received with sincere satisfaction your message of goodwill on the occasion of the acceptance by Great Britain of a mandate for Palestine. Keeping steadfastly7 in view7 the establishment in that country of a national home for the Jewish people, while safeguarding the legitimate interests of all sections of  the
community, the administration will maintain the traditional principles of liberty and justice which have ever guided the councils of the British Empire, In the task of reconstruction which lies ahead of us I am confident that I may rely on the loval co-operation of yourself and of your co-religionists.Proposed Russian Considate-General. In answer to an enquiry from Lord Allenhy [No. 448] Lord Curzon informed him [No. 459] that at present His Majesty&apos;s Government could not sanction the appointment of a Russian Consul-General in Palestine, as no form of Russian Government was officially recognized by them.POLAND.Relations with the Soviet Government. On 13th May Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 327] as follows : At yesterda3&quot;&apos;s meeting of the Parliamentary Commission for Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister made a declaration in which he stated that the Polish Government were desirous of concluding peace with Soviet Russia ; that the Polish policy was not imperialistic, as is proved by the agreement with the Ukrainans. He discredited the sincerity of the Soviet Government in regard to its peace intentions. The Polish Government wished to obtain a j)eace which would guarantee Polish prosperity. He further dwelt on the unanimity which was shown by all classes during the discussions regarding the. peace negotiations, and stated that the Polish Government would soon propose to the Soviet Government the renewal of negotiations in one of the places which had been suggested by the Poles, leaving the choice to the Soviet Government.PORTUGAL.Portuguese East Africa. On 28th April the High Commissioner of South Africa, reported the receipt of intelligence that fighting was impending in the Barue Portuguese territory between a Portuguese force and rebels.   Further information&apos; was reported by him on 14th May saying that up to 10th May all was quiet, but it-was believed that the Portuguese were- waiting until the grass could be burnt. The rebels were only in small numbers and would cross the border immediately the. Portuguese attacked.RUSSIA.Warning to the Soviet Government. On 7th May Lord Curzon telegraphed a. message for M. Cbicherin to Mr. Porter at Reval [No. 138]. In this message Lord Curzon said that he thought it well to give a warning that any naval aggression against the border States would be regarded as offensive action, and that the British fleet would receive orders to support the State which had been attacked.To this M. Chicherin replied through Reval on 10th Maj7 as follows :  Having acquainted itself with 3rour Note of 8th May the Russian Government cannot restrain from expressing its astonishment at the fact that the British Govern-ment finds it possible to put forth intimations or even hints completely devoid of any accurate and definite form, and to base thereupon military threats which, are able to aggravate anew the mutual relations between Great Britain and Russia. We would be thankful if the British Government would kindly point out to which Soviet fleet it ascribes preparations, on what sea this fleet is presumed to find itself, and against which border State these preparations in the view of the British Government can be directed ; seeing that the Russian Government is completely at a loss to understand what Soviet fleet the British Government means. As a matter of fact no part of the naval forces of the Republic are engaged in any military preparations whatever, and no attack on any border State is contemplated by them. Soviet Russians policy is a policy of ease aimed at amicable solutions of all conflicts with other countries, and Soviet Russia takes up arms only when compelled to-do so, being -attacked by others. Your above wireless cannot but induce the Soviet Government-to think that there must be some hidden forces behind the scene trying to aggravate the relations between Great Britain and Russia, and to entangle Great Britain into active operations in this case naval operations against Russia. At this juncture, as in all previous similar cases, the Russian Government is of the opinion that by means of direct negotiations and of a frank and open exchange of views all causes of conflict
between Great Britain and Russia can be removed, and a.complete settlement of alb -disagreements attained.    We can declare categorically that if such negotiations, including all pending questions between both Governments, shall not yet begin, the fault lies not with the (Soviet Government,Imprisoned British Nationals. On 8th May Mr. Grant Watson reported [No. 495] from Copenhagen that M. Litvinoff had informed Mr. Gall that the Soviet Government declined to release British nationals committed for grave offences on the basis of the -assurance proposed by Lord Curzon.M. Litvinoff repeated his readiness to recommend their release if the British Government would make a declaration, similar in effect to that made by the French .and the Belgian ; but doubted whether this would be accepted now by Moscow in view of the offensive operations recently conducted by British naval forces against the Bolsheviks on the Black Sea..South Russia.Note from General Wrangel. -On 11th May Admiral Webb telegraphed [No. 573] from Constantinople the following translation of a Note, dated 2nd May, from General Wrangel to General Percy : On 2nd April His Majesty&apos;s Government invited General Denikin to put a stop to the civil war by notifying him that they would otherwise withhold all assistance from the forces of South Russia.On assuming command, I informed His Majesty&apos;s Government that being -compelled to comply with this demand, I referred to their just appreciation of the fate of the army, fleet, and population of South Russia, considering it a point of honour for those to whom we had remained constantly faithful, to save all those who were unwilling to accept money at the hands of their foes. At the same time I pointed out the impossibility of our entering into direct negotiations with the enemy.Lord Curzon&apos;s communication to M. Chicherin, transmitted to me by Admiral Seymour, expressly declared that in the event of the Soviets refusing to accept British mediation or of a fresh offensive on the southern front, His Majesty&apos;s Government would send vessels to protect my armies in the Crimea and to prevent an invasion by-Soviet forces of their (? refuge) in the Crimea. By your letter of 29th April you communicated to me the substance of a message addressed by Lord Curzon to the British High Commissioner, Constantinople, to the effect that M. Chicherin, putting forward (? two) (? agreements) in acceptance of the enemy&apos;- demands, led His Majesty/s Government to conclude that the sole solution was for me to endeavour to obtain the desired conditions from the Soviets myself.I cannot conceive that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to abandon to-day the mediation which they themselves assumed after being informed of the impossibility of mv entering into direct, negotiations with the enemy.Recognizing the difficult situation of the Kuban force, isolated on the coast of Caucasus, I released their Ataman from his undertaking not to enter into separate negotiations and authorized him to treat direct ; and, finding himself compelled to negotiate with the Bolsheviks under particularly unfavourable conditions, General Boukretweig now begs me to send him means of transporting to the Crimea at least 10,000 men who refuse to yield to the Soviets. This I am now doing, and it affords one more proof that no promises or armistices could secure tranquillity in a Bolshevik Russia, seeing that the population itself could not tolerate the Soviet regime. This fact is proved by the insurrection on the Upper Don in April 1919, in which 40,000 Cossacks participated, under the leadership of one officer and Cossack non-commis-sioued officers only, as well as by the recent risings at Eisk and Timochovka.The sole means of preventing permanent anarchy in Russia would be to retain.a healthy nucleus round which could be centred all movements which declare them-selves against the Bolshevik tyranny. - It is not by a fresh march on Moscow7 that Russia can be saved from the danger now threatening all Europe, but by a union of all popular forces striving against the Communists. Consequently the integrity of the territory occupied by the forties of South Russia as well as-that.of the Cossack territories, constitutes an absolute necessity for the attainment of the object which the Allies have set up for themselves and which imposes itself on the whole civilized world-that of ending anarchy and civil war in Russia,With a view to facilitate the negotiation of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the Soviets I propose to send to London special delegates fully acquainted with the present situation here and familiar with my intentions.   Finally, I consider it my 16-3 C   .
duty to call the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the other Entente Powers to the danger which would result for them also, from the situation that would follow on depriving me and my army of all assistance at this critical moment and without justification by any action of mine. - This would mean a triumph for the Soviets and a capitulation to Communism, and would necessarily exercise a permanent influence on the feeling towards the Allies of the Russian people who will not come to terms with the Soviets.On 17th May Admiral de Robeck reported [No. 599] the return from the Crimea of General Milne wdio had been much impressed by what he had seen : the army was once more a fighting force, thanks to its reorganization and the restoration of its. morale.On 17th May Lord Curzon instructed Admiral de Robeck as follows [No. 445] :  You should make it clear to General Wrangel that he must not expect any change in our policy as the result of the Polish offensive. His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined to endeavour to bring hostilities in South Russia to a close as soon as possible. A telegram has now been received from M. Chicherin accepting our proposals for negotiations on the basis of a general amnesty, and I am replying that I am anxious &apos; for them to begin with the least possible delay. They should be carried on in South Russia, and I see no occasion for delegates from General Wrangel to come to London. Any negotiations with the Soviet Government that may take place here will be purely commercial.Please explain to General Wrangel that he is not being left to negotiate alone with the Soviet Government ; the latter have agreed to the participation of a British military representative, and I am sending out a political officer to assist him as soon as possible.SERBIA.Negotiations with Italy. Telegraphing from Belgrade on 5th May [No. 120] Sir Alban Young reported that it was announced that the Council of Ministers, after a prolonged sitting under the presidency of the Crown Prince, and after hearing the views of Monsieur Trumbitch in regard to all aspects of the Adriatic question, had decided unanimously to continue direct pourparlers with Italy and accordingly &quot;had authorized Messrs Pasitch and Trumbitch to enter into relations with the Italian delegates.\8ee &quot; Italy.&quot;]SWEDEN.Aland Islands. On .14th May Mr. Barclay telegraphed [No. 144] from Stockholm that he had had a conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the Aland Islands. The Minister told him that that question was entering a critical stage; unless the Supreme Council took it up very shortly the islanders would probably bring it to a head by declariug themselves incorporated with Sweden. They were determined not to accept the autonomy granted them by Finland. . If in the event of such a declaration the Finnish Government should take military measures, Swedish public opinion being unanimous on the question, a severe crisis would almost inevitably follow. Finnish reprisals in Aland would not be tolerated. On 12th May the Minister for Foreign Affairs had had a long conversation with the Finnish Prime Minister, and had again proposed a friendly agreement on the basis of the principle of self-determination, but the latter had refused absolutely to entertain such a proposal.TURKEY.Cilicia. -On 13th Mav Admiral Webb telegraphed from Constantinople as follows [No. 583] :r-Two Americans who left Mersina on 25th and 27th April respectively confirm the information as to the weakness of the French military position in Cilicia, the lack of military material, such as artillery, aircraft and wireless, and the indifferent quality and morale of the colonial troops, amongst whom desertion is frequent in one case 200 Algerians deserted in a body. The railway communications between. Adana and Mersina were constantly cut by Nationalist bands, and the French were burning Turkish villages along the line as a punitive measure.   Both Americans had
the impression that the French did not desire to keep the.Armenians in Cilicia. American relations with the Turks were comparatively friendly, but it is feared that if the situation did not improve it would become necessary to withdraw their relief workers from the interior.An American who left Mersina on 2nd May reports that the situation at Adana was then quiet, but he confirmed the burning by the French of Turkish villages along the Adana-Mersina line, and the relief of Sis by a French force of one battalion with artillery. He also reported that a French column of 3,000 men had been sent to Borejik and that fighting continued at Aintab, confirming Consul-General Wratislaw&apos;s telegram of 9th May. The Armenian patriarchate has communicated to me a copy of an earnest appeal from the Armenian volunteers on the Am anus line at Deurt Yol and Hassan Beyli for funds to procure the necessary food and munitions to carry on their successful defence. The appeal ends with a declaration of their ability to hold their own if only the necessary funds are forthcoming.Mr. Wratislaw&apos;s telegram [No. 46] referred to above, was as follows :   The United States Consul at Aleppo has communicated to me the following telegram dated 1st May, received from Miss Fearson, a British subject at Aintab, and addressed to the Prime Minister, London.   I do not understand whether the United States Consul has transmitted the telegram, so I repeat it: We British subjects, Americans, and Armenians have been under fire of the Turks for four weeks ; the situation in Cilicia is desperate, and the French forces are inadequate ; use the influence of the Allies to establish order quickly ; cop^v to Viscount Bryce, London.The United States Consul added that the American missionaries who arrived 1st May from Aintab, confirmed the statement of Miss Fearson, and reported the situation to be extremely dangerous. The Turks have artillery with which they began to bombard the Christian quarter on 29th April; shots struck the American hospital building and wounded six Armenians.The Ismid District. On 13th Maj- Admiral Webb reported [No. 581] that the military situation in the area south and east of Ismid had had no important develop-in cuts during the past 10 days. Both the Government and the Nationalist forces had had small local successes and setbacks, but there appeared to have been no fighting of importance, and neither side seemed inclined to risk a decisive engagement at present.The Circassians, upon whom the government largely relied for support in this area, were reported to be earning the ill-will of the population owing to their looting of horses, &amp;c.
