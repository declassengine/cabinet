FOREIGN   COUNTRIES  REPORT.ALBANIA.Attitude of Italy and Serbia. On 31st August&apos;Sir George Buchanan reported [telegram unnumbered] from Home the receipt of a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the following effect: The Italian Government have no knowledge of and, in any case, have never agreed to the Serbian line of demarcation within the Albanian frontier as laid down by the Powers in 1913. In a note of 19th April 1919, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs conveyed lo Count Bonin the assurance given by the Voyvode Michich to General Franchet d&apos;Esperey that the Serbian troops had been ordered not to cross the eastern frontier of Albania and had observed that order. That assurance, however, -did not then, and does not now, conform to the facts as the Serbian Government themselves admit, although they have declared their policy to be that of respecting the 1913 frontiers. The cause of the present Albano-Serb conflicts is the continued occupation by the Serbs of the territory assigned by the Powers to Albania in 1913, which is not even justifiable now on the ground of the existence of a state of war since all the peace treaties have been signed. The only natural and fair solution of. these conflicts, and the one affording the greatest hope for the maintenance of peace in the Balkans, lies in the direct action of the Powers with the view to enforce respect of all the laws of the Albanian frontiers determined in 1913, until and unless the Peace Conference eventually reach a different decision on the frontier question. The Italian Government have already counselled moderation to the Albanians, who have replied that they are working for the liberation of their national territory, and that they would respect the 1913 frontiers. The Italian Government are prepared to intervene again with the Tirana Government; but they strongly hold that such inter-vention could only have any prospect of success if accompanied by an assurance in the name of the Powers that the Powers will enforce&apos; respect for the 1913 frontiers until the Peace Conference determines others. The Italian Government trust they may receive an early expression of His Majesty s Governments concurrence in this practical and fair solution of the question.Sir George wrent on to say that in the course of conversation Count Manzoni said that the Italian Government could not advise the Tirana Government to restrain the Albanian forces within the line of demarcation of which the Italian Government did not themselves admit the existence. The Italian Government only recognize the 1913 frontiers, and he himself believed that the Serbs were endeavouring to confuse the issue by appealing to this line of demarcation. - He admitted that the Albanian gendarmerie had been the aggressors last month in the Scutari region; but the Tirana Government were able to control the gendarmerie, who had now withdrawn from the frontier, but it was by no means certain that they could control all the &apos; Albanian bands. He did not personally consider the Serb contention that the Albanians had first broken the peace as entirely justified so long as the Serbs remained in occupation of areas well within the 1913 frontier of Albania: He produced a map purporting to show such areas still in Serb occupation, and said that if the Serbs realty meant to respect the 191o frontier as they stated, they should at once withdraw from those areas.It was pointed out to him that your aim was to promote peace between the Albanians and the Serbs, and that the present representations of His MajestyS Government were for the purpose of enlisting the assistance of the Italian Govern-ment and not of discussing the question of the Albanian frontier. He replied that the Italian Government fully sympathized with your object, and he had himself, while conducting his recent negotiations with the Tirana Government, personally counselled that Government to avoid any provocative action vis-a-vis the Serbs ; but the Italian Government felt that they could not go further than that unless the Powers could give the Albanians the assurance as to the 1913 frontier suggested in the Italian Governments note.He mentioned incidentally that he considered you to be under a misapprehension as to the Italian Governments recognition of the Tirana Government, with whom they had negotiated and concluded an agreement merely as a de facto Government but had not recognized as de jure.
On 3rd September Sir Alban Young telegraphed [No. 256] some observations on this telegram which had been repeated to him. He said that he had always understood that the point of view of the Serbian Government was that the Albanian question formed part of that of the Adriatic and could not be dealt with separately. It was. he thought, clear that the Serbs would be justified in thinking that, with our conni-vance, the Italians were settling the various parts of the Adriatic question in detail, if their Government succeeded in inducing the Great Powers to press the Serbians, pending a final settlement, to retire to -the 1913 frontier, and at the same time by recognizing the independence of Fiume to let that question settle itself.In a declaration made to the Chamber on 31st August the President of the Council said that the line of demarcation must be the line of separation until the permanent frontiers were decided, and that if the Albanian attacks were renewed, which he hoped would not be the case, more energetic measures would be taken.He also stated that the Italian Government were aware that the Serbian were ready to resume negotiations at any minute, and expressed the hope that pourparlers would soon be renewed at the point where they had been broken off at Pailanza.Next day Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 982] as follows to Lord Derby : The Italian Ambassador informs me that the Italian Ministers at Belgrade and Athens have received instructions to join with their French and British colleagues in urging the immediate evacuation of. Albanian territory within the 1913 frontiers.lam replying thatthe Serb-Croat-SloveneGovernmenthave already given assurances that they will recognize the independence and integrity of Albania within the frontiers which the Supreme Council may determine, and that they have promised not to advance beyond their present positions if the Albanians do not attack them; that the representations suggested would invite a rejoinder from, the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government in the sense that their present zone of occupation was that allotted to them by General Franchet d&apos;Esperey in October 1913 ; and that this rejoinder would raise the whole question of the occupation of other Adriatic territories under analogous armistice provisions. I am suggesting, therefore, that tbe action of the Powers should be confined to taking note of the Serb-Croat-Slovene assurances as to the eventual integrity of Albania, and to urging on the Albanians and Jugo-SIavs the necessity of keeping the peace pending a final settlement.As regards the Greeks, I am merely saying that the representations appear unnecessary since the Hellenic Government do not contemplate embarking on the occupation of Albanian territory until their frontiers are settled.Telegraphing again to Lord Derby [No. 986] on 6th September, and at the same time-to Sir Auckland Geddes [No. 717] and Sir George Buchanan [No. 406], Lord Curzon said that the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government had proposed that an Inter-national Commission should proceed to Albania to enquire into the recent disturbances. He considered that the presence of an International Commission would have a pacifying effect, and that its functions might be extended so as to allow it to report to the Ambassadors&apos; Conference on the general situation in Albania and the best means of maintaining peace. He instructed the three Ambassadors to inform the Governments to which they were accredited, and to enquire their views.On 6th September Sir Alban Young telegraphed [Nos. 261, 262, 263], saying that in an interview which he had had that morning with the President of the Council he had been begged to communicate the Presidents appreciation of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government ; adding, however, that the latter were going too far when they said that the Serb-Groat-Slovene Government had definitely accepted whatever frontiers might be defined by the Supreme Council, as naturally they could not give a pledge to accept detrimental modifications of the 1913 agreement. He also pointed out that some parts of the frontier had not yet been defined.In regard to the present condition of affairs, Sir Alban drew the Presidents attention to certain statements in the Press to the effect that the defeated Albanian army was being-pursued,, if not by Serbian troops, at any rate by Albanian tribes who were marching- on Tirana. To this the President replied that the troops were obeying their orders to halt on the line of demarcation, and that there was no complicity between them and the tribes who were in revolt.Sir Alban had also seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had told him that after his conversation with the President of the Council, orders had been sent to the authorities not only to refrain from encouraging any Albanian tribes to take hostile action against the Government at Tirana, but also to exercise such influence as the
Serbs possessed over any of tbe tribes, to the end that no such action should be taken It was now thought not to be in the interest of the Serbs to destroy the present Albanian - Government, the more so that there was a prospect of delegates from that Government meeting delegates from the Serbian Government for the purpose of making a friendly arrangement. Also the desirability was recognized of avoiding any action which might render more difficult the negotiations with Italy so shortly to be resumedARMENIA.Attitude of the Hussion Soviet Government. The following is a translation of an intercepted wireless message sent on 21st August to the Armenian Minister for Foreign Affairs by M. Ghicherin : I acknowledge receipt of your radio of 17th August and beg to inform you that the investigation which will be undertaken by the central authorities will include all cases mentioned by you. Russia has fraternal feeling towards the Armenian people, and the Soviet Government will do all in its power in order to remove all obstacles to the resumption of friendly relations with the armenian people.....the local Russian detachments were accused.   Onthe other hand, Soviet Russia hopes that the Government of the Armenian Republic will cease repressive measures against all those who hold views which form part of the programme of the Soviet Government and are dear to the working masses of Soviet Russia. We hope that our plenipotentiary representative in Erivan, (?) Comrade Legran, and your representative Egiasaroff in Moscow will do all in their power to avert any conflicts which may arise between the two Governments.BALTIC STATES.The Letts and Soviet Russia. Mr. Tallents telegraphed from Riga on 4th September [No. 327] that on 2nd September the Lettish Constituent Assembly had unanimously decided to ratify the treaty of peace with Russia.The Baltic Conference. Mr. Tallents telegraphed [No. 318] from Riga on 31st August that the Political Commission had considered a resolution the previous day, in which the principal points involved were (1) mutual recognition de jure ; (2) the peaceful settlement of frontier disputes ; (3) no convention with Azerbaijan or any other Power against any participating State; (4j the preparation of a secret military defensive convention to be held after the conclusion of peace with Russia by all the States ; and (5) the conclusion of various political and economic conventions.Certain reservations had been added by the Lithuanian delegation, apart from its general reservation regarding Ukraina, which included a desire for an&apos;entente cordiale between all the Baltic States. Until the differences between Lithuania and Poland had been settled in.the essentials they considered a political entente to be impossible. They approved a military convention among the States who were already at peace with Russia, and they expressed the hope that Finland, after she had made peace with Russia, and Poland, after settlement with Lithuania and peace with Russia, would also join the military convention.*Mr. Tallents supplemented the above by telegraphing [No. 323] on 2nd September that at the opening meeting Poland had asked that the defensive convention should be effective on a fixed date after its ratification, but Finland, Latvia and Esthonia insisted that this should only take place after peace with Russia had been concluded. Mr. Tallents thought it probable that these three States would conclude a convention among themselves, to which Poland would not be admitted until she had made peace. In case of an attack on any one of the States participating in the convention, it would be provided that the rest would consider whether the circumstances of the attack would caR for their taking action under the convention.Attitude of Finland. Telegraphing [No. 589] from Helsingfors on 2nd September Air. Iviclston said that he had been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the question of mutual recognition de jure had been discussed the clay before by the President and Council of Ministers. It had been decided that they shordd take no steps with regard to Latvia and Lithuania until it was apparent what action Poland intended to take. As regarded Esthonia, Finland had already given her recognition, and since Poland had taken the initiative in recognizing Finland, the question of recognition by the latter did not arise.
-Lithuania and Poland. Proposed Terms of Agreement. On 1st September Mr. Tallents sent tbe following telegram [No. 321] : I submitted on 1st September to the Polish and Lithuanian representatives at Riga a draft agreement containing four provisions, of which the following is the substance : (1) A declaration of the desire for a peaceful settlement.(2) An agreement to hold an immediate joint conference, and to submit ail questions not thus decided to the League of Nations for final determination-ation.(3) Guarantees of tolerance for Poland in Lithuania and vice versa.(4) A disclaimer of engagements hostile to each other, and special referenceby Lithuania to the fact that annexation by the Russian treaty of peace hadexpired.Each representative, without committing his Government, expressed his personal opinion that this agreement could probably be accepted. I expressly stated that I acted informally without committing His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Frontier Question. On 4th September Mr. Tallents addressed the following-telegram [No. 32S] to Colonel Ward, the British representative at Kovno : -I have already ascertained that in December last the Supreme Economic Council laid down a provisional frontier between Poland and Lithuania. Roughly, this line appears to run along the northern frontier of theSuwalki district and the Rivers Mary cha, and Igorka, to the west of Grodno. I have never been notified of this, and I am not clear that either j-ou or the Lithuanian Government were aware of it. It is true that the Poles, who were aware of this decision, failed to return to this frontier until driven back by the Bolsheviks, and I observe from your reports that they are still proposing on military considerations to disregard it.Nevertheless, it is imperative that needless fighting between the two peoples should be avoided, and I believe it to be in the ultimate interests of Lithuania herself that the Government should be prepared to discuss immediately with Poland a temporary military demarcation line involving a Lithuanian withdrawal at certain points, especially Suwalki.. Please represent this urgently to Government. Unless their attitude makes this useless, or other arrangements have been made, I would ask Warsaw to send delegates to an immediate conference on the front, and would myself attend.Mr. Tallents also sent the following telegram [No. 329] to Sir Horace Rumbold at Warsaw on 6th September : I beg that you will use your influence to persuade the Poles to send fully authorized delegates to Mariampol, or elsewhere, to establish a military demarcation fine. As recognized by you, the Lithuanians attach special importance to Seiny, and it is expedient that the Poles should be prepared to leave that in Lithuanian hands at present. I am instructing Colonel Ward to represent to the Lithuanian Government the importance of securing the due subordination of the Commander-in-Chief to the Cabinet&apos;s instructions, and the mischievous character of such a bulletin as that issued from Kovno on 3rd September. All my indications are that in spite of such foolish manifestations the Lithuanian Government genuinely desire peace.M. Chicherin addressed to the Lithuanian Minister for Foreign Affairs on 4th September a telegram expressing- the Bolshevik desire to maintain peace with Lithuania, and pointing out that the Polish-Lithuanian fighting raised grave questions of Russian military safety. He offers to evacuate ail Lithuanian territory by Bolshevik forces, if Lithuania can guarantee that Poland will not invade it. If a provisional military line could be established between Poland and Lithuania, the Lithuanians would no doubt immediately attempt to fix a similar line with the Bolsheviks, and this could presumably be arranged even though the Polish-Lithuanian demarcation line would doubtless not coincide with the Lithuanian-Russian frontier. The Poles could represent their interests as regards such a line at the Mariampol Conference. If it were established, I would suggest to the Lithuanian Government that Allied officers should be aRowed to come through from Poland to satisfy themselves that the Bolsheviks were observing whatever undertaking- had been given by them.[See also under &quot; Poland,&quot; p. 11.]BELGIUM.The Ministry. On 25th August Sir George Grahame reported from Brussels [No. 98] that&apos; the Minister for Foreign Affairs had definitely resigned, and that the President of the Council would take over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 20-2 B
Tile Minister of War, who also had been desirous of resigning, had withdrawn his resignation, and it was probable that the whole of the Cabinet would remain in office until, at. any rate, the King s return from Brazil in the latter part of OctoberBOLIVIA.Provisional Government [F.C.R., xxiii, p. 3].-In acknowledging the instructions conveyed in Lord Curzon&apos;s telegram [No. 25] of 10th August, Mr. 0&apos;Reilly telegraphed [No. 59] from La Paz on 31st August as follows : There seems to be no longer any possibility of a counter-revolution by the Liberals, who are the only political party which could resent our early recognition of the provisional Government. The only remaining danger is a barrack revolution of some sort, and recognition is the best means for us to prevent this.I therefore recognized yesterday as authorized with a strong proviso for free elections. The Bolivian Minister in London has been requested, and has consented, to continue. The elections are announced for 14th November and the meeting of the National Convention for 20th December.0&quot;There is no news of the United States recognition yet, to the regret of my United States colleague.THE CAUCASUS.British Prisoners at Baku [F.C.R., xxiv, p. 4]. On 6th September Lord Curzon sent the following message [No. 424] to Mr. Grant Watson at Copenhagen: Please inform M. Litvinoff, with reference to the message for the Azerbaijan Government transmitted in my telegram No. 411 of 11th August, that I have as yet received no reply from the latter. I have, however, received a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Representive at Teheran conveying an informal message from Baku to the effect that the Government there offer to release the British subjects whom they have detained in return for the Turkish prisoners at Malta. The majority of these, however, were arrested by the Turkish Government and are, therefore, at the disposal not of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but of that Government, while others are undergoing detention after conviction by a regularly constituted Court of outrages against the non-Moslem population of Asia Minor and violations of the Geneva Convention.It would, therefore, be impossible to-release these people at the request of the Azerbaijan Government.You should impress upon M. Litvinoff in the strongest possible terms that, there can be no sort of justification, either legal or moral, for the continued detention of over 50 Allied subjects, including women and children, at Baku, where the information in the possession of Pfis Majesty&apos;s Government shows indisputably that though the Republic of Azerbaijan may be recognized as independent by the Soviet Government at Moscow, the coup cVetat leading to its establishment was brought about in consultation with Moscow and that it continues to rely on the support of Soviet troops.It is, therefore, evident that if, as M. Litvinoff has stated, the Soviet Government are willing to use their good offices, those good offices will certainly be effective.His Majesty&apos;s Government have no desire to detain any Russian who is anxious to return to Soviet Russia a day longer than is necessary to ensure that all British subjects, whether in Russia, Azerbaijan or elsewhere, who are at present in the power of the Bolshevik authorities are released, and if the same spirit animated the Soviet Government a speedy settlement of this issue, would be assured. So anxious are His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure the repatriation of aU prisoners, whether British or Russian, without any exception, that they are prepared to agree upon a common date and common places for simultaneous delivery to be determined. The detention of Russian prisoners in England or elsewhere is indeed only maintained with a view to bring about this desirable solution on the earliest possible date.Georgia and Batum. On 30th August Commander Luke reported [No. 371] from Tiflis that the Georgian Government had informed him that they had received a protest from Mustafa Ivernal against their acquisition of Batum. They stated that they intended to ignore the communication.CHILE.Relations with Peru rF.C.R., xxiii, p. 5].-On 6th September Mr. Vaughan telegraphed [No. 166] from&quot; Santiago that it was stated that an agreement had been
Teacher! on most points as the result of interviews between the President (Senor Leguia) and Senor Puga-Borne. He had learnt this from a source which was usually reliable, though unofficial.CHINA.Relations with His Majesty&apos;$ Government.^--Telegraphing [No. 375] from Peking on 26th August, Mr. Ciive conveyed a special message to Lord Curzon from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had informed him that he had been specially charged by the Cabinet to express the hope and desire of the Chinese Government to maintain the most friendly relations possible with His Majesty&apos;s Government. The great position held in the world to-day by Great Britain, and the magnitude and importance of her interests in China, were fully realized by the Chinese Government, who were determined to do their utmost to encourage good relations.Mr. Clive believed in the sincerity of the message, which he acknowledged in suitable terms of reciprocity. He pointed out, in his telegram, that there were four principal points on which the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government particularly interests the Chinese Government. These are (I) the Anglo-Japanese Alliance; (2) the Shantung question; (3) relations with Russia ; (4) Chinese resumption of relations with Germanj^.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Proposed Seizure of certain Properties of the Habsburg, Liechtenstein and other Families. The following is the translation of an intercepted wireless message sent from Prague : The Municipal -Council of Prague has decided unanimously to press on the President and Government their claim to landed property, including 102 estates formerly owned by the municipality and illegally confiscated in 1547 by Ferdinand I., and actually in the possession of the Habsburgs or the Liechtenstein family or others. Twenty-five other Bohemian towns, whose property had. also.been seized for the profit of the dynasty, have simultaneously been invited to take parallel action, in order to obtain a revision of the proceedings taken long ago, as well as an indemnifi-catioa from the private property of the Habsburg family situated in Czecho-Slovakia.DENMARK.League of Nations. On 31st August Mr. Grant Watson telegraphed [No. 694] from Copenhagen as follows : At a recent meeting the Scandinavian Ministers were agreed on the necessity of admitting into the League of Nations, as soon as possible, States at present outside the League. The Conference expressed, the hope that the work of the Commission, foreseen in Article 9 of the Covenant, should be carried through, so that agreements could be made for the effective, limitation of armaments, without which peace could not be assured.Revision of the Constitution. On 7th September Mr. Grant Watson reported from Copenhagen [No. 707] that the revision of the Constitution had been approved by the plebiscite held on 6th September. 47 per cent, of the electorate had voted in favour of, and 1 per cent., chiefly Socialists, against revision. The newly acquired districts of Schleswig will thus be able to take part in the forthcoming general election.ECUADOR.President Tamayo&apos;s Cabinet. On 4th September Mr. Wilson telegraphed [No. 41] the following list of President Tamayo&apos;s new Cabinet : Doctor Clemente Ponce (Foreign Affairs); General Delfin Trevino (Interior); Gustavo Aguirre Overweg-(Finance); Doctor Pablo Vasconez (Public Instruction) ; and Octavio G. Icaza.GERMANY.Statement on Foreign Affairs in the Reichstag. On 2nd September Lord Ivihnarnock telegraphed [No. 532] the following summary of a communication made to the Reichstag by the Minister for Foreign Affairs : -Time had shown that neutrality had&apos; been and remained the only right and. possible, policy for Germany.    A suggestion had been made to him from certain
quarters that Germany should join the Bolsheviks against the Western Powers, and thus break the bonds of the Treaty of Versailles. After full consideration he had rejected these ideas ; their acceptance would have immediately made Germany the centre of war. In the present state of disarmament It would not have been justifiable to offer up the flower of their youth. The burden of the consequences which would have accompanied the probable gradual transformation of Bolshevism would have-fallen with full force on Germany. From other quarters the proposal had been made for Germany7 to make common cause with the Allies against- the Bolsheviks. This also was impossible and would have produced civil war. The Russian people would for long regard as enemies whoever associated themselves with their attackers. It followed, therefore, that the German Government must take up a position of reserve towards the Governments of General Wrangel and Ukraina. France had recognized General Wrangel and had informed the German Government, who had taken note of the communication. No Power which was in conflict with Soviet Russia could count on German support.The basic idea of German policy was that the Soviet Government was de -facto the ruling power in Russia ; but relations between Germany and Russia were not yet normal. Negotiations were proceeding as to the case of Count Mirbach. It was absolutely false that the German Government had concluded a secret treaty with Soviet Russia. On the other hand, Moscow was reproaching them with having a secret treaty with Poland, which was also untrue. Only open negotiations were being carried on with Poland, which had so far had no result.The Minister then denied that he had told a Swiss interviewer that Germany would march against Poland. He had merely stated, in reply to a question as to what Germany would do in case of the violation -of her neutrality by Poland, that whoever violated her neutrality would find her on the side of their opponents.Dr. Simons declared that there was much explosive material in German-Polish relations ; and if the negotiations which he had initiated did not- soon lead to results, it might well happen that the kettle of German public opinion would boil over. This-had already happened at Breslau. He then gave confidential information, which has not been, published, respecting the French note on the subject of the attack on the French Consulate. With regard to Upper Silesia, he expressed the view that the wishes of the population in the sphere of administration must be met, and that in certain questions independent representations must be granted ; but all this must naturally not be outside the &apos;: Reich,&quot; and not outside Prussia.Turning to the Geneva Conference, he stated that extensive preparations had been made by the German Government. There were signs that the memoranda handed in at Spa would have an essential influence. He had already communicated with the Powers chiefly concerned, with a view to tbe experts getting into touch before the Conference began, so that dictation should not be again encountered, and the same di-fficulities arise as had arisen at Spa. It was necessary that the public in foreign lands, and especially in France, should be informed as to the extent of German, financial capacity and the seriousness of her situation. The idea that she could and would pay everything must be combatted. It was to be hoped that it would be possible to prepare the ground, and so arrive at an understanding at Geneva,Internment of Russians. On 6th September Lord Kilmarnock reported [No. 537] that, in agreement with the French and Italian Ambassadors, he had told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty&apos;s Government trusted that the German Govern-ment would take adequate precautions to secure the internment and disarmament of Russians who had crossed the frontier. His Excellency stated that the German Government entirely shared the views of His Maj esty&apos;s Government on the question, and were anxious to fulfil their obligations of neutrality. He asked me to explain the difficulties which they7 were under owing to the extent of the frontier and the few parties of troops at their disposal, and to support his request that permission should be given to delay the reduction of effectives to which they7 were pledged. Requests in this sense had already been made to the Allied Governments, but no answer had been received. The French Ambassador had told him the matter w7as being discussed that day by the Council of Ambassadors.GREECE.Rumania and Czecho-Slovahia [see F.C.R., xxiv, p. 7 (Rumania)].-On 26th &quot; August Lord Granville reported [No. 215] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had.
twice received a hint from the Rumanian representative that it was desirable that the Bulgarian Government should be officially warned that Greece would support Rumania in the event of the latter being attacked by Bulgaria. The Minister had avoided giving an answer, wishing first to consult M. Venizelos, as the request was not official; his own opinion, however, was that, should Bulgaria attack, Greece would certainly support Rumania.HOLLAND.The British Protectorate in Egypt. Lord Curzon sent the following telegram [No. 125] to Sir Ronald Graham on 30th August :  The Dutch Minister called to-day and saw Sir Cecil Hurst. He asked whether, in view of what had appeared in the Times, it was now necessary for an agreement to be concluded with Holland for the recognition of the British Protectorate in Egypt.2. Sir Cecil Hurst replied that the points of agreement between Lord milner&apos;s Mission and the Egyptians providing for a treaty of alliance stipulated that this treaty would not come into force until agreements had been come to with foreign Powers regarding the capitulations. The obligation of His Majesty&apos;s Government to protect foreign rights now covered by the capitulations would be maintained and the power to achieve this would be ensured. The negotiations now being conducted at The Hague would therefore be in no way affected and their completion at an early date was rendered all the more necessary.3. You are authorized to give the Dutch Government an assurance on the lines of para. 2 above.MEXICO.Congress. Mr. Cummins reported from^Mesico on 2nd September [No. 201] that on the previous afternoon Senor De la Huerta had opened the 29th Session of Congress. His speech had contained nothing remarkable ; the country was pacified and relations with foreign Powers were cordial, though unofficial.POLAND.Messages from M. Chicherin. On 31st August Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 786] the substance of two telegrams addressed by M. Chicherin to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs respectively. Both were dated 29th August and were received on the following day.The telegram to M. Witos began by expressing satisfaction at the specific intentions of the Polish Government as set forth in their recent wireless message; hoping that their conduct would be in harmony with their declarations ; and protesting against the assertion that the Soviet Government had threatened the existence of Poland. Their aim had been to secure themselves against fresh attacks by Poland ; and the British Government had recognized their right to demand such guarantees. If the Polish Government were ready to conclude peace, such action on their part.would correspond not only with the wishes of the Soviet Government, but also with the needs of the present situation, for the Red Army, far from having lost anything of its martial, strength, had merely withdrawn to a new position and was beginning a fresh advance. The Soviet Government, which considered friendly relations with Poland indispensable, w?as pleased to observe similar tendencies on the Polish side. But its satisfaction would be greater if the Polish delegation at Minsk would not spin out negotiations by complaining of difficult conditions, which were inevitable in time of war. Two clays ago the Soviet Government had suggested to the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs that negotiations should be transferred to Esthonia, and had also approached the Esthonian Government in the matter.In the telegram to Prince Sapieha, M. Chicherin informed him that his proposal&apos;, to transfer negotiations to Riga had arrived late on 27th August, and the Soviet Government had already proposed to the Polish and Esthonian Governments their transference to Esthonia ; the conflicting proposal put forward two days later by the Polish Government might cause fresh delay, and Prince Sapieha&apos;s reference in his radio to complaints raised by the PoRsh delegation at Minsk against hardships inevitable in time of war increased the fear that the Polish Government would continue to employ such dilatory tactics.    The proclamation of the Revolutionary20-2 C   .
Committee on the western front was an unfortunate fact, but the Polish delegation had already declared themselves content with the satisfaction received, and Prince . Sapieka&apos;s renewed reference to the incident caused surprise. At the same time that&apos; Prince Sapieha s telegram, proposing transference to Riga, was received, another . arrived from the Polish Prime Minister ashing for the removal of technical difficulties affecting correspondence between Warsaw and Minsk, and assuming that the latter town would continue to be the seat of negotiations. This divergence of views was manifest proof of the lack of solidarity in the Polish Government, and was a further reason for accepting the Soviet proposal made two days earlier to transfer the negotiations to Esthonia.In his reply Prince Sapieha declared that there was no real divergence between his former telegram and that sent by the Prime Minister on 26th August, in which the latter insisted, among other things, on the difficulties of communicating with their Government experienced by the Polish delegates at Minsk. A telegram had been sent by those delegates on 28th August complaining of the impossible situation occasioned, by Prince Sapieha&apos;s own telegram of the same date ; and at the same time the latter, with a view to avoiding delay, approached the Latvian Government in regard to the transference of the negotiations to Riga. The Polish Government was glad to see that the Soviet Government also appreciated the necessity of their transference to a neutral country, but felt bound to point out that the proposal regarding Esthonia only reached them after they had applied to the Latvian Government. The consent of the latter was received early on 30th August, and in order to avoid all delay the Polish Government hoped that the Soviet Government would accept Riga as being in all ways suitable for both parties. The Polish delegation would leave for that city as soon as the Soviet Government had notified their agreement.Telegraphing again on 3rd September, Sir Horace transmitted [No. 800] the following translation of a telega-am received by Prince Sapieha on 2nd September from M. Chicherin :-Desirous of avoiding everything that may retard the course of negotiations and postpone the conclusion of an armistice and peace preliminaries between Russia, Ukraina and Poland, the Soviet Governments &quot;of Russia and Ukraina, having obtained the consent of the Lettish Government, accept Riga for further negotiations with Poland, on condition that the inviolability of the Russian and Ukrainan delegation is guaranteed, including personnel; also the right of free and unhindered communi--cation with their respective Governments by wireless and couriers whose sealed bags will not be searched. Both Governments await the answer of the Lettish Government through the intermediary of Poland before expressing a final consent to the choice of Riga for the above purpose. The Russian and Ukrainan delegation will be presided over by Adolf Abramowitch Joffe and the staff of the delegation will be communi-cated to the Polish Government. The delegation will possess powers for an armistice, preliminary peace negotiations, and the subsequent conclusion of a treaty of peace. As soon as the required guarantees are given by the Lettish Government the delegation will proceed to the new place fixed for negotiations.La consequence, on 2nd September the Minister for Foreign Affairs instructed the representative of the Polish Government at Riga to approach the Lettish Government in order to obtain the guarantees mentioned in the above telegram from the Soviet Government, and to request the Lettish Government to inform the Soviet Government direct and to report to&apos; the Polish Government.On 6th September he further reported [No. 812] that the Lettish Government had given full guarantees that the Soviet Peace Delegation should have full-&quot;and unhindered facilities for communication with the Moscow Government during the forthcoming negotiations. In spite of this, the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs had received a telegram from M. Chicherin raising further difficulties; insisting, for Instance, that all tbe members of the Soviet delegation should be accommodated in one house, &amp;c. The Minister for Foreign Affairs thought that this showed a design to spin out the proceedings. He would send the Polish delegation to Riga on the 9th or - 10th instant.Note from the Lithuanian Government. Telegraphing on 5th September [No. 809] Sir Horace Rumbold said that the Polish Government had received a note from the Lithuanian Government, in which the latter, in the form of an ultimatum, threatened to attack Poland if Polish troops cross the line of An gusto w.   The matter had been
discussedbn the previous day at the meeting of the Council of National Defence, and the Polish Government would send a note to the Lithuanian and other Governments with an explanation of the reasons of the conflict.Note regarding the Lithuanian Government. -On 6th September Sir Horace Rumbold transmitted [No. 813] the following translation of a Note addressed to him that day by the Minister for Foreign Affairs : I have the honour to-bring the following facts to the notice of your Excellencv : . The Lithuanian Government made an agreement with the Soviet Government at the time of the retreat of the Polish armies, under which the Red Army was authorized to use Lithuanian territory both for the passage of its troops and also for the establishment of a military base. This fact in itself was a direct violation of the principles of neutrality in the war between Poland and Soviet Russia. When, during the course of their retreat, the Polish armies were obliged to evacuate the ethnographically Polish territory, viz., the&quot; districts of Augustow and Seiny, which had been definitely allotted to Poland by the decision of the Supreme Council of 8th December 1919, Lithuanian troops occupied this territory, and during their occupation committed numerous acts of violence against the Polish population, which, in their eyes, was guilty of fidelity to Poland. When in its turn the Polish army, after having repulsed the Bolshevik invasion, penetrated into the territory of Augustow and Suwalki, the Lithuanian Government addressed a Note to the Polish Government informing the latter that it did not recognize the frontiers previously fixed and demanding the retreat of the Polish troops beyond the line of Grajewo Augustow. The Polish Government replied by a note couched in friendly terms, but demanding that the Lithuanian troops should retire outside the recognized frontiers of Poland and proposing direct negotiations to settle all questions at issue. During their advance into their national territory the Polish troops tried to avoid all bloodshed ; and certain Lithuanian detachments which had been disarmed were irmnediately set free and their arms restored, although their presence on Polish territory was illegal. The Polish Government had hoped by this conciliatory attitude to effect an amicable solution of the points outstanding between it and the Lithuanian Government. At this point on 2nd September at daybreak the detachment of Polish cavalry, which occupied Seiny, was attacked by Lithuanians and retired with the loss of four men killed. Afterwards the Lithuanian army attacked Suwalki and advanced on Augustow without any preliminary declaration of war. It has been proved that in this military movement Bolshevik troops co-operated with Lithuanians. Further, the Pohsh Government have detailed information concerning the Bolshevik concentra-tion which is going on behind the Lithuanian line of advance on Lithuanian territory. The Polish Government is therefore confronted by an act of direct aggression on the part of Lithuania. It is certain that the Lithuanian armies are acting in alliance with the Red army, and that the Lithuanian Government has become the instrument of the Soviet Government.Sir Horace added that a similar communication had been addressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the League of Nations, requesting that all means at the disposal of the League should be used to prevent the Lithuanian Government from continuing its inexplicable action and with a view to freeing the Polish Government from the unwelcome necessity of having to fight the Lithuanian nation.[See also, under Baltic States, p. 5.]The Socialists. On 1st September Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 791], saying that the Bobotaik, the organ of the Polish Socialist party, had published in the number for 31st August a resolution passed by the Executive Committee of that party and the Socialist members of the Diet regarding the attitute of the party towards peace.   The foUowing was a summary of the resolution :- -1. Friendly terms between the Polish and Russian nations are ah historical necessity for both nations and one of the indispensable conditions of a general peace.2. The basis of a just fixing of the eastern frontier of Poland can only be the ethnographic principle, with the introduction of certain modifications by mutual agreement. The party therefore demands the rejection of all imperialistic annexations of foreign territories, and requests its members in the Government, the Peace Conference and the Council of National Defence to exercise their influence in this direction, and make the above principle a condition of further collaboration.3. Regarding the people living in the territories lying between Russia and Poland, the latter ought to demand that these nationals should have the right to decide their own fate for themselves, as they became an integral part of the Russian
State not as the result of mutual agreement, hut by military annexation. This principle could not, however, be established between Poland and Russia by armed force, but could be only the result of the emancipation of these nations.4. The party is of opinion that the Treaty of Peace between Soviet Russia and Lithuania of .12th--July is an imperialistic treaty and cannot be recognized by the Polish Republic. The question of the future fate of the provinces of Vilna and Grodno is considered as an internal question between Poland and Lithuania, which can be decided &quot;only in accordance with the - free . expression of the will of the interested populations.SPAIN.Reconstruction of the Ministry. Mr. Wing-field telegraphed from San Sebastian on 2nd September [No. 325] that the Prime Minister, Sehor Dato, had reconstructed his Ministry after having been assured of the continued confidence of the King. The new Ministry included Senores Eza, Bugallal, Espada, Lema, Ordonez, Canal, Portago and Pascual, who were respectively Ministers of War, the Interior, Public Works, Foreign Affairs, Justice, Labour, Public Instruction and Finance ; the Prime Minister being also Minister of Marine. ,TURKEY.Financial Situation. On 28th August Admiral de Robeck telegraphed [No. 972] the conclusions arrived at hy himself and his French and Italian colleagues after an examination of the general financial situation at the request of the Grand Vizier. The other two High Commissioners were telegraphing in similar terms to their Governments.It appeared that the customs receipts, the chief remaining source of income, had dropped considerably during the past- few months, and that the taxes in Anatolia were collected by the JCemalists, the result being a desperate situation and a danger that its prolongation might give rise to disorder, which in the end would bring about the ruin of the country.The High Commissioners were of opinion that the Allied Governments should send their representatives on the future Financial Commission to Constantinople immediately, that they might make themselves acquainted with the situation and propose suitable measures ; the official constitution of the Commission necessarily awaiting the coming into force of the treaty.Meanwhile, as a palliative, to remedy the situation, that is, for a short period, the High Commissioners made certain proposals : the procuring of;, absolutely indispensable-sable resources by the Turkish Government should be facilitated, for which purpose they should be allowed to dispose of certain stocks until now regarded as a- pledge for the Allies, and [? raise a loan] of ; T. 2,000,000. This permission should, however, be conditional on the acceptance by the Turkish Government of the control of the Administration of the Public Debt over the use of the sums-raised.
