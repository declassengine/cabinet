FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN. *   .Demand for Consular Representation in China. On 22nd March Mr. Lampson telegraphing from/Pekin, transmitted [No. 152] the following message, dated 17th March, from His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Kashgar : A letter from the Afghan Government to Yin has just arrived here. I am informed that it contains a request to the Chinese not to allow the British any jurisdiction, in the case of Afghan subjects, and. asks for the establishment of friendly relations (group undecipherable), and the appointment of an Afghan Consul at Kashgar. The Chinese reply will probably be non-committal; they are undoubtedly apprehensive of x4fghan and Bolshevik aggression.AUSTRIA.Tyrol and Germany. On 1st April Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 183] from Vienna as follows: The State Chancellor yesterday received delegates from Tyrol, whose demand for union with Germany was strengthened by the fact that an Innsbruck news-paper had been carrying out an unofficial plebiscite on the-subject. The result of this plebiscite is reported to be that over .1.00,000 replies in favour of union were received from a&apos;population of about 300,000.The State Chancellor informed the deputation that at present a movement for the revision of the Treaty of Peace had no prospect of success. The demand for union was calculated to embarrass both Austria and Germany, and isolated efforts on the part of the provinces of Austria to attain this union could not be tolerated. He intended to abide by the Treaty of Peace, and to lay the case for union before the League of Nations when the time came. In the meantime he would communicate the resolution of the Tyrolese Diet to the Ambassadors&apos; Conference at Paris.During the last week the Press campaign in favour of union has been renewed more intensely than ever, and it remains to be seen whether it will die down as the result of the pronouncement of the State Chancellor.BALTIC STATES.Lithuania and the Soviet Government. On 30th March Mr. Ward, the British representative at Kovno, telegraphed [No. 44] the terms of a Note about to be communicated to the Soviet &quot;Government by that of Lithuania. In this the latter Government would state that it was prepared to conclude peace with Russia as Lithuania had fought only for its independence, and its territory was now clear of Russian soldiers ; but the complete recognition of Lithuanian independence was a necessary preliminary to negotiations, the Lithuanian Government being, on its part, ready to acknowledge the Soviet Government as the legal Government, of Russia. The Note would Rirtber state that the ethnographical boundaries of Lithuania were, broadly speaking, the old Governments of Sulvaki, Kovno, Vilna and Grodno, and that these boundaries should be recognized in the peace terms.Finland, Poland and the Peace Terms. In a message sent from Helsingfors on 29th March [No. 334], Lord Acton stated that he had been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the peace terms had only been communicated to the Govern-ment of Finland three clays earlier, that there was no agreement in principle between the two countries in regard to the joint peace, and that it was premature to say that the Finns had no objection to the Polish peace conditions. The Finnish clauses in. the proposed treaty related to the recognition of the independence of Finland, the cession of Pechenga as compensation for territory ceded in 1864, self-determination for the Russian Karelians, and compensation for war material taken during the civil war.CHILE.Relations with the United States. On 1st April Mr. Vaughan reported [No. 62] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had addressed a friendly note to the United
i 1oStates Ambassador expressing satisfaction at the explanations furnished to the Chilian -Ambassador in Washington, and adding that Chile never had accepted and never would accept intervention in Tacna and Arica, or in regard to any other question, from: any Power or Powers.In reply the United States Ambassador said that the principle of non-intervention had been for years incorporated in the policy of the United States towards Chile,CHINA.Tibet. On 26th March Mr. Lampson telegraphed  from Pekin [No. 163] as&quot; follows: In view of persistent rumours appearing in the Chinese Press here of aggressive intentions on the part of the Tibetans and of the consequent necessity for the Chinese to take counter military measures, I have arranged for Reuter to issue a: dementi emphasizing the fact that the Tibetan forces have remained strictly on the defensive, pending an eventual settlement by negotiation.   Wai-chaio-pu Counsellor, in reply to an enquiry by ReutePs agent on the subject of these, rumours, stated : &quot; Wai-chaio-pu has received reports that the Tibetans are increasing their troops although no actual aggression has taken place,&quot;DENMARK.The Political Situation.-On 4th April Mr. Grant Watson telegraphed [No. 373] from Copenhagen saying that there had been an improvement in the political situation. Electoral reform would be of a more democratic character, and it was clear that many concessions had been made by the Conservatives and the Left. During the last few day^s the King&apos;s position had been weakened by a temporary loss of popularity with the working men ; and though the Socialist party was not officially republican, the republican movement had gained many adherents.GERMANY.    &apos;.Memorandum from the United States Government. On 26th March Lord Kilmarnock reported [No. 179] that the American Commissioner had, on instructions from his Government, handed informally to the German Government a memorandum declaring that the Government of the United States was observing with sympathy the efforts of the German Government to oppose, on the one hand, the reactionary military forces, and on the other the forces of anarchy, and pointing out that any subversion of the industrial order would preclude measures of relief and render difficult the resumption of trade relations.Lord Kilmarnock added that the Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires had also been instructed to congratulate the German Government.ITALY.Foreign Policy. On 29th March Sir  George Buchanan sent [No. 102]  the following summary of a speech by the President of the Council on Italy&apos;s foreign . policy : The President of the Council, speaking in the Chamber yesterday, claimed that the Governments foreign policy had not roused specific criticisms, and was recognized as being in accordance with public opinion. As regards the Adriatic question, the Government had clone and would continue to do its best to avoid causes for disagree-ment with Jugo-Slavia and to establish good relations for the future. It had never considered Jugo-Slavia as an enemy, and trusted she would become a friend to Italy v and enter into her economic and ctiltural sphere. The Adriatic question could be settled by agreement between Italy and Jugo-Slavia, and any opposition to such settlement caused. by exaggerated nationalist sentiment must be overcome. An. alternative solution was the application of the Treaty of London, to which France and. Great Britain consider themselves bound, but which the United States Government does not recognize. The coast between Volosca and Dalmatia and the town of Fiume would pass under the treaty to Croatia. The country must rmderstand that the application of the treaty involved the renunciation of Fiume.   A third solution was
the-acceptance of a modified form of the French, English, and American proposals of 9th December last,, based on a scheme of a buffer State of Fiume, which are not satisfactory-tb Italy and still less to Jngo-Slavia. On the whole, direct agreement was the best solution, but at the worst the third solution would safeguard Italy&apos;s economic interests. Every effort must be made to settle the cprestion, and he believed he was voicing public opinion in saying that, if absolutely necessary, Italy would be prepared to make grievous sacrifices to reach a settlement.As regards Russia, the Government would facilitate the visit of representatives of popular associations and felt sure that once the actual conditions in Russia were ascertained many existing views would be revised. A knowledge of Russian condi-tions would promote the maintenance of tranquillity at home.No concrete programme about Constantinople could be formulated, as at present-nothing definite had been settled. The Government were, however, strongly in favour of the Turks remaining at Constantinople and of its remaining the seat of the Caliphate. They aspired to no territorial gains in Turkey or Asia Minor, which would only constitute a serious burden and be a cause for future wars, but they could not remain disinterested in the freedom of the Straits and the huge quantities of raw materials in Asia Minor, and would co-operate with the Allies in putting them to advantage.British Coal.  On 31st March Lord Curzon informed [No. lib] Sir George Buchanan as follows in regard to the supply of British coal to France, giving him liberty to use the information as he might think fit for the purpose of dispelling false impressions: The Italian Ambassador tells me there is considerable misapprehension in Italy as to promises which are said to have been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to France at a meeting here on 23rd March at which the export of coal was discussed.Misleading press accounts, inspired from French sources, have apparently caused the Italians much anxiety.The French were chiefly apprehensive about the fulfilment of contracts placed during the latter part of 1919, and an undertaking was given that that question should be immediately examined to see what effective steps could be taken officially to ensure fulfilment. On the other hand, no assurance was given that cargoes for France would not be requisitioned for home requirements, but while it was impossible to undertake that requisitioning should be subject to a fortnights notice, as suggested by the French, a promise was made to examine the question in order to prevent hardship to the greatest possible extent.As the French have not for some time been receiving the full quantities of coal they were promised originally, His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook to examine with competent French officials the possibility of making up at some future date the deficit, amounting to some 200,000 tons per month, by supplying that quantity through the National Coal Bureau, the department which controls the production and distribution of coal in France.Finally, no undertaking was given that the price of coal for export should be reduced, although an announcement was made at the meeting x)f the new arrange-ment whereby the price of bunker coal will be reduced to 75-s. per ton. This of course applies to bunkers for all vessels regardless of flag or destination.JAPAN.Troops in Siberia. On 1st April Mr. Alston reported [No. 114] that the following official statement had been issued with the Emperors approval: Inasmuch as a new despatch of troops to Siberia had as its object the relief of the Czecho-Slovak forces, it is clear from the declaration issued at the time of their despatch that Japan should carry out the withdrawal of her troops as soon as. the evacuation of those forces was in fact completed. Nevertheless, the geographical relations of Japan with Siberia are of a different nature from those of other Powers. In particular not only have political conditions in Far Eastern Siberia a direct influence upon the conditions of Corea and Manchuria, but the actual state of affairs is such as to afford no assurance of the safety of the lives and property of the -many Japanese residents in Siberia,
It is for these reasons that Japan cannot immediatelv r , - ,1of her troops from Siberia.   At the same time, she has no politicalVtj   ^T^ on Russia.   Consequently, as soon as the political 1 &quot;ifel ^ territories are stable, part of the dauger to Corel and (V uSXSli^X, COnt?guo*s the lives and the property of our nationals secure1 and tSfrSSn oS?       remove(^ guaranteed, then, as soon as possible upon the complete ^^STSS?MESOPOTAMIA.Emir Abdulla proclaimed King of Irak. Telegraphing from Cairo on 26th March-[JSTo. Pol. 1607], Colonel^ Meinertzhagen reported the receipt of the proclamation of &quot; Le Oongres general dTrak &quot; declaring the independence of Irak and Mesopotamia from the Persian Gulf to the northern boundary of the Mosul vilayet, the cessation of the British occupation of Mesopotamia, and the appointment of Emir Abdulla to be King of Irak, with his brother Zeid as regent.The Emir Feisal, in a personal letter to Lord Allenby, stated that the declaration as to the future of Mosul and Mesopotamia was made by the Mesopotamians in Damascus, not by the Syrian Congress ; and that to bring about a satisfactory settlement his Government would be pleased to open negotiations with that of His Majesty.On 1st April Lord Curzon instructed Lord Allenby [No. 292] to&quot; inform King-Hussein and the Emir Abdulla that the future of Mesopotamia could only be decided after the wishes of the inhabitants had been ascertained : the 29 Mesopotamians in Damascus were not regarded as being in a position to speak for them.PERSIA.Bolshevik Intentions. The Viceroy of India transmitted [No. 3866] on 25th March General Malleson&apos;s unofficial appreciation of Bolshevik intentions against Persia, which was sent in compliance with Sir P. Cox&apos;s request. After suggesting the necessity of reserve in treating reports emanating from Persian sources, General Malleson expresses the opinion that Bolshevik threats and schemes directed against Persia should not be taken too seriously. They were mostly the work of one man, Broido, who had been a firebrand in Turkestan, and it was probable that less would be heard of them in future. In his opinion, the Bolsheviks, who are realty more afraid of us than we of them, exaggerate our numbers, and entertain the belief that we intend to attack them, which would be the signal for an uprising of all the Mohamedans of Central Asia, aided by the Afghans, against them. The information he possesses does not support the idea that any formal invasion of Persia by their forces is contemplated by Bolshevik policy as countenanced by Moscow. It is more probable, General Malleson thinks, that Persians, armed, trained, and instructed by the Bolsheviks in revolutionary agitation, are to be let loose in Persia. He has repeatedly warned the Governor-General against such an eventuality, and urged the necessity of taking precautions, but is not satisfied that everything possible has been done in this direction. The increasing scarcity of food in Turkestan may oblige the Bolsheviks to turn to Persia for supplies, but if trade with Russia is reopened by the Allies, it can be presumed that Persia will follow suit. In this case General Malleson insists on the necessity of absolutely refusing payment in Russian paper money. He advocates an intimation to Russians of all denominations that they cannot come south of the Atrak river, which is the international boundary.Policy of the Government. Sir P. Cox telegraphed [No. 151] on 26th.March that he had received a definite statement as to the policy of the Persian Government, which was based on the belief that we are not contemplating a voluntary retirement-According to this statement, so long as the Bolsheviks refrain from aggression, Persia has no intention of making any move into Russian territory. Should the Bolsheviks cross the frontier or attack, Persia will, of course, defend herself. The Persians presume that the same principles apply to British forces in Persia. 15-1 &apos;        &apos; b
- L&apos;   N \ -;&apos;   POLAND.-Relations^ unth the Soviet Gove7mment.-Ori 31st March Sir Horace Rumbdld trans-rrnitted [No. 218] the following wireless telegram, dated 28th March, which had been received -on the previous day bv the Minister for Foreign Affairs&apos; frnin M.&apos;Ghicherin:-     &apos; &apos;. &quot;; The Russian Soviet. Government received with great satisfaction the proposal contained in your radio of yesterday to open up peace negotiations on 10th April. It considered it as the harbinger of an early establishment of peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries and accepts the proposed date.The Soviet Government cannot, however, conceal its surprise that the Polish Government proposes only a temporary truce on one sector of the front, throu op which the delegation is invited to cross the line.i:&apos; From the point of view of the Soviet. Government there appears to be no reason whatever why the shedding of blood and fresh sacrifices should be prolonged even for one day. once the two (? Powers)&apos;have decided to open up negotiations in such a short time. The Soviet Government considers, therefore, an immediate truce on the whole front where the Polish and Russian armies oppose each other as indispensable, and cannot understand why military operations should :continue after the. decision to hold a ^conference has been reached. , ............ , -As, an indispensable; ^consequence ,of this, would be the necessity for holding the conference in a neutral State, the Soviet Government thinks a town in Esthonia would be best suited for the prarpose, and is approaching the Esthonian Government accordingly. On the acceptance of these conditions the Soviet Government is convinced thai; there will be no serious impediment lo a successful termination of the negotiations between the two States.Telegraphing again On 2nd April [No.&apos;223], Sir Horace said that M. Patek had in reply informed M; Chicherin that the Polish Government could not accept, the proposal for a truce on the whole  ront. Also that the Polish Government must abide by their decision in regard to the place of meeting, which had been fixed by them at the request of the Soviet Government. And as the latter had not replied to the question as to the number of their delegates, it was feared that it would be impossible to complete the necessary arrangements by 10th April.i 1 RUSSIA.Overtures to.^77ie?&apos;;ica.-Mr, Hodgson reported [No. 82].from Vladivostock, on 23rd March, that General Graves, commanding the; American Expeditionary Force, had received, through a representative of ..the: Moscow .. Government, a Note from M.. Chicherin. for transmission to.Washington.The Note expressed the wish of Russia to initiate peace negotiations with America, and held out i great prospects for &quot;trade between,America and Siberia. , .The Situation in the&apos; Grimea.- Telegraphing- - [N-6i 321]: on 2nd April, Admiral de Robeck, associating hiniself with General Milne,: reported the situation in the Crimea at the moment to be as follows-:-General Denikin was relinquishing his command, and it appeared probable that General Wraugel would be offered the command of the armed forces of South Russia. A Bolshevik advance: into the Caucasus was considered imminent by the; High Commissioner arid General Mil no, and further complications were likely to arise should Georgia and Azerbaijan become Bolshevik, as was probable. The possibility of a Bolshevik attack on Poland or Rumania was also not to be omitted from the reckoning. The importance of keeping an army in being in the Crimea,-until ; the; conclusion of peace; negotiations, was obvious. Admiral de Robeck and General Milne expressed astrong opinion that the time had come for a general settlement on all questions with the Soviet Government.British Prisoners in Russia.; -On -1th April a message [No. 103] from Lord Curzon was sent to Mr. Porter at Reval. for communication to , M. Chicherin. After recording the receipt of a . telegram from M. Litvinoff, and dealing with a matter raised in the early part of that telegram, the message proceeds, as follows :-At the end of his telegram M. Litvinoif states that, as regards the British nationals committed for grave offences and detained in Russia, the Soviet Government will be glad to consider the question: of a free pardon and their release as soon as they
feel confident that His Majesty&apos;s Government have finally stopped all hostilities against Russia and support to her enemies.I wish to point out to you once again that His Majesty&apos;s Government are no longer engaged in hostilities against the Soviet Government, nor are they now giving support to any forces which are fighting against that Government. So far from doing this, they are about to re-establish trade with Soviet Russia and are now awaiting the arrival of the Russian delegates to take the first steps in that direction. In these circumstances I feel sure that you will see that there is nothing to prevent you from acting as M. Litvinoff suggests, and I shall look forward with confidence to the early release of all British subjects from Russia without any of the exceptions contemplated under a condition of affairs that no longer exists.SYRIA.Communication from the Syrian Cabinet. Telegraphing from Cairo on 25th March [No. 36], Colonel Meinertzhagen reported the receipt of a letter, addressed to Mr. Lloyd George, from the President of the Syrian Cabinet, in which the latter stated that his Government was prepared to discuss the situation with that of His Majesty on the following basis : (1) British assistance when compatible with Syrian independence, which should be complete ; (2) territorial unity ; (3) provision being-made that British interests should be safeguarded.Attitude of Emir Feisal. In the same telegram [No. 36], Colonel Meinertzhagen also said that Lord Allenby had received a very friendly personal letter from Emir Feisal insisting on his determination to prevent any episodes which might disturb the peace with the Allies, and in particular with ourselves, for whom he had great friendship.On 4th April Colonel Meinertzhagen transmitted [No. 51] the text of a letter addressed to Lord Curzon by Emir Feisal, who stated that it was the firm intention of the S3?rian nation to preserve the peace with Great Britain. As to himself, he would come to Europe, as invited by Lord Curzon, as soon as he had received at least a private declaration from the British Government of its recognition of that, indepen-dence which was demanded by the Arabs of Syria and Mesopotamia, without distinction of religion.King hussiens Attitude. On 27th March Lord Allenby reported [No. 298] that he had received a telegram from the King of Hejaz on the question of the independence of Syria. He declared that the Arabs who responded to our call in the war were still our friends, and appealed to us not to support those who hated Arab interests, which were bound up Avith British. He emphasized the principle of Arab unity, and stated that he supported the resolutions of the Syrian and Mesopotamian Congress, which -were in accordance with the declaration of the Peace Conference. Lord AUenby added that King Hussein had begun to use the term &quot; Grand King of the Arabs &quot; in his signature.
